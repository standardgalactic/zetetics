PREFACE
The
idea may seem
quixotic,
but
it
is
nevertheless
the
author's confident hope that this book will give a fresh interest
to
the
story
of Greek
mathematics
in
the
eyes
both
of
mathematicians and of classical scholars.
For the mathematician the important consideration is that
the
foundations of mathematics and a great portion
of
its
content are Greek.
The Greeks laid down the first principles,
invented the methods ah
initio, and
fixed the terminology.
Mathematics
in
short
is
a
Greek
science,
whatever new
developments modern analysis has brought or may bring.
The interest of the subject for the
classical
scholar
is no
doubt
of
a
different
kind.
Greek mathematics
reveals an
important aspect of the Greek genius of which the student of
Greek culture
is apt to
lose sight.
Most people, when they
think of the Greek genius, naturally call to mind
its master-
pieces in literature and art with their notes of beauty, truth,
freedom and humanism.
But the Greek, with his
insatiable
desire
to know the true meaning of everything in the uni-
verse and
to be able to give a rational explanation of
it, was
just as irresistibly driven to natural science, mathematics, and
exact reasoning in general or logic.
This austere side of the
Greek genius found perhaps
its most complete expression in
Aristotle.
Aristotle would, however, by no means admit that
mathematics was divorced from
aesthetic
; he could conceive,
he said, of nothing more beautiful than the objects of mathe-
matics.
Plato 'delighted in geometry and in the wonders of
numbers
;
(iyea)fj.irprjTos
/J-rjSel^
da-irai,
said
the
inscription
over the door of the Academy.
Euclid was a no
le.ss typical
Gi'eek.
Indeed, seeing that so much of Greek is mathematics,

vi
PREFACE
it iH arguable that, if one would understand the Greek genius
fully, it Avould be a good plan to begin with their geometry.
The story of Greek mathematics has been written before.
Dr. James Gow did a great service by the publication in 1884
of
his Short Hidory of Greek Mathematics, a scholarly and
useful work which has held its own and has been quoted with
respect
and
appreciation
by
authorities on
the
history
of
mathematics in all parts of the world.
At the date when he
wrote, however, Dr. Gow had
necessarily
to
rely upon
the
works of
the pioneers
Bretschneider, Hankel, AUman, and
Moritz Cantor (first edition).
Since then the subject has been
very greatly advanced
; new texts have been published, im-
portant new doeumejits have been discovered, and researches
by
scholars and mathematicians
in
different countries have
thrown light on many obscure
points.
It
is, therefore, high
time for the complete story to be rewritten.
It
is
true
that
in
recent years
a number
of
attractive
histories of mathematics have been published in England and
America, but these have only dealt with Greek mathematics
as part of the larger subject, and
in consequence the writers
have been precluded, by considerations
of space
alone, from
presenting the work of the Greeks in sufficient detail.
The same remark applies to the German histories of mathe-
matics, even to the great work of Moritz Cantor, who treats
of the
history of Greek mathematics
in about 400 pages of
vol.
i.
While no
one would
wish
to
disparage
so great
a
monument
of indefatigable
research,
it was
inevitable
that
a book on such a scale would in time prove to be inadequate,
and to need correction in details; and the
later editionshave
unfortunately
failed
to take
sufficient
account
of
the new
materials which have become available since the first edition
saw the light.
The
best
history
of Greek mathematics which
exists
at
present
is
undoubtedly that
of Gino Loria under the
title
Le
acieiize
emtte
nelV
antica
Grecla
(second
edition
1914,

PREFACE
vii
Ulrico Hoepli, Milano).
Professor Loria arranges
liis material
in
five
Books,
(1) on
pre-Euclidean geometry,
(2)
on
tlie
Golden Age of Greek geometry (Euclid
to Apollonius), (3) on
applied
mathematics, including astronomy,
sphaeric,
optics,
&c.,
(4) on the
Silver Age
of Greek geometry,
(5)
on
the
arithmetic
of
the
Greeks.
Within the
separate Books
the
arrangement is chronological, under the names of persons or
schools.
I
mention
these
details
because
they
raise
the
question whether, in a history of this kind, it is best to follow
chronological order or to arrange the material according to
subjects, and, if the latter, in what sense of the word 'subject'
and within what limits.
As Professor Loria says, his arrange-
ment
is
' a compromise between
arrangement
according
to
subjects and a strict adherence to chronological order, each of
which plans has advantages and disadvantages of its own
'.
In
this book I have adopted a new arrangement, mainly
according to subjects, the nature of which and the reasons for
which will be made clear by an illustration.
Take the case of
a famous problem which plays a great part
in the history of
Greek geometry, the doubling of the cube, or
its equivalent,
the finding of two mean proportionals in continued proportion
between
tw^o
given
straight
lines.
Under
a chronological
arrangement this problem comes up afresh on the occasion of
each new solution.
Now it is obvious that,
if all the recorded
solutions are
collected together, it
is much
easier to see the
relations, amounting
in some
eases
to
substantial
identity,
between them, and to get a comprehensive view of the history
of the problem.
I have therefore dealt with this problem in
a separate section of the chapter devoted to
' Special Problems',
and
I have followed the same course with the other famous
problems of squaring the circle and trisecting any angle.
Similar
considerations
arise with
regard
to
certain
well-
defined subjects such as conic sections.
It would be incon-
venient
to
interrupt the account
of Menaechmus's
solution
of the problem of the'two mean
proportionals
in order
to

viii
PREFACE
consider the way in which he may have discovered the conic
sections and their fundamental properties.
It seems to me
much
better
to
give
the complete
story
of
the
origin and
development
of
the geometry of the
conic
sections
in one
place, and this has been done in the chapter on conic sections
associated with the name of Apollonius of Perga.
Similarly
a
chapter has been devoted
to algebra
(in connexion with
Diophantus) and another to trigonometry (under Hipparchus,
Menelaus and Ptolemy).
At the same
time the outstanding personalities of Euclid
and Archimedes demand chapters to themselves.
Euclid, the
author
of
the incomparable
Elements,
wrote on almost
all
the other branches of mathematics known in his day.
Archi-
medes's work, all original and set forth in treatises which are
models of scientific exposition, perfect in form and style, was
even wider
in
its range of subjects.
The imperishable and
unique monuments of the genius of these two men must be
detached from their surroundings and seen as a whole if we
would appreciate to the full the pre-eminent place which they
occupy, and will hold for all time, in the history of science.
The arrangement which I have adopted necessitates (as does
any other order of exposition) a certain amount of repetition
and cross-references
; but only in this way can the necessary
unity be given to the whole narrative.
One other point should be mentioned.
It is a defect in the
existing histories that, while they state generally the contents
of, and the main propositions proved in, the great treatises of
Archimedes
and
Apollonius,
they make
little
attempt
to
describe
the
procedure by which
the
results
are
obtained.
I have therefore taken
pains,
in
the most
significant
cases,
to
show the
course
of
the argument
in
sufficient
detail
to
enable a competent mathematician to grasp the method used
and to apply it, if he will, to other similar investigations.
The work was
begun
in
1913, but
the bulk
of
it was
written, as a
distraction, during the
first three years of the

PREFACE
ix
war,
the
hideous course
of
which
seemed
day by day
to
enforce the profound truth conveyed in the answer of Plato
to the Delians.
When they consulted him on the problem set
them by the Oracle, namely that of duplicating the cube, he
replied,
' It
must
be
supposed, not
that
the god
specially
wished
this
problem
solved, but
that
he would
have
the
Greeks
desist from war and wckedness and
cultivate
the
Muses, so
that, their passions being assuaged by philosophy
and mathematics, they might live in innocent and mutually
helpful intercourse with one another '.
Truly
Greece and her foundations are
Built below the
tide of war,
Based on the
cryst&.lline sea
Of thought and
its eternity.

INTRODUCTORY
The Greeks and mathematics.
It is an encouraging sign of the times that more and more
effort is beiag directed to promoting a due
appreciation and
a clear understanding of the gifts
of the Greeks to mankind.
What we owe
to
Greece, what
the Greeks
have
done
for
civilization, aspects of the Greek genius
: such are the themes
of many careful studies which have made a wide appeal and
will surely produce their
effect.
In truth all nations, in the
West at all events, have been to school to the Greeks, in art,
literature, philosophy, and science, the things which are essen-
tial to the rational use and enjoyment of human powers and
activities, the things which make life worth living to a rational
human being.
' Of all peoples the Greeks have dreamed the
di-eam of life the
best.'
And the Greeks were not merely the
pioneers in the branches of knowledge which they invented
and to which they gave names.
What they began they carried
to a height of perfection which has not since been surpassed
;
if there are exceptions, it is only where a few crowded centuries
were not enough
to provide the accumulation of experience
required, whether
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
hypotheses
which at first could only be of the nature of guesswork, or of
suggesting new methods and machinery.
Of all the manifestations of the Greek genius none is more
impressive and even awe-inspiring than that which is revealed
by the history of Greek mathematics.
Not only are the range
and
the
sum
of
what
the Greek
mathematicians
actually
accomplished wonderful in themselves
;
it is necessary to bear
in mind that this mass of original work was done in an almost
incredibly short space of time, and in spite of the comparative
inadequacy (as
it would seem to
us) of the only methods
at
their disposal, namely those of pure geometry, supplemented,
where
necessary,
by
the -ordinary
arithmetical
operations.

INTRODUCTORY
Let
us,
confining
ourselves
to
the
main
subject
of
pure
geometry by way of example,
anticipate
so
far
as to mark
certain definite stages in
its development, with the intervals
separating them.
In Thales's time (about 600
B.C.) we find
the first glimmerings of a- theory of geometry, in the theorems
that
a
circle
is
bisected by any diameter, that an
isosceles
triangle has the angles opposite to the equal sides equal, and
(if Thales really discovered this) that the angle in a semicircle
is a
right
angle.
Rather more
than
half a century
later
Pythagoras was taking the first steps towards the theory of
numbers and
continuing
the work
of making
geometry a
theoretical science
; he it was who first made geometry one of
the subjects of a liberal education.
The Pythagoreans, before
the next century was out
(i. e. before, say, 450 b. c), had practi-
cally completed the subject-matter of Books I-II, IV, VI (and
perhaps III) of Euclid's Elements, including all the essentials
of the 'geometrical algebra' which remained fundamental in
Greek geometry
; the only drawback was that their theory of
proportion was not applicable
to incommensurable but only
to commensurable magnitudes, so that
it proved inadequate
as
soon
as
the
incommensurable
came
to
be
discovered.
In the same
fifth century the
difficult problems of doubling
the cube and
trisecting any
angle, which
are
beyond
the
geometry of the straight line and circle, were not only mooted
but solved theoretically, the former problem having been first
reduced to that of finding two mean proportionals in continued
proportion
(Hippocrates
of
Chios)
and
then
solved
by
a
remarkable construction in three dimensions (Archytas), while
the latter was
solved by means of the curve of Hippias of
Elis known as the quadratrix
; the problem of squaring the
circle was also attempted, and Hippocrates, as a contribution
to it, discovered and squared three out of the five lunes which
can be squared by means of the straight line and circle.
In
the fourth century Eudoxus discovered the
great
theory
of
proportion expounded in Euclid, Book V, and laid down the
principles of the method of exhaustion for measuring areas and
volumes
;
the conic sections and their fundamental properties
were
discovered by Menaechmus; the theory
of
irrationals
(probably
discovered,
so
far
as
V'2
is
concerned,
by
the
early Pythagoreans) was generalized by Theaetetus
; and the

geometry of the sphere was worked out in systematic
trea-
tises.
About
the
end
of
the
century
Euclid
wrote
his
Elements
in
thirteen Books.
The
next
century,
the
third,
is that of Archimedes, who may be
said
to have anticipated
the
integral
calculus,
since, by performing what are
practi-
cally integrations, he found the area of a parabolic segment
and of a
spiral, the
surface and volume
of a sphere and a
segment of a sphere, the volume of any segment of the solids
of revolution of the second
degree, the centres of gravity of
a semicircle, a parabolic segment, any segment of a paraboloid
of
revolution,
and any segment
of
a
sphere
or
spheroid.
Apollonius
of Perga,
the
' great geometer ', about
200
B. c,
completed the theory of geometrical
conies, with specialized
investigations
of normals
as maxima
and minima
leading
quite easily to the determination of the
circle
of curvature
at any point of a conic and of the equation of the evolute of
the conic, which with us
is part of analytical conies.
With
Apollonius the main body of Greek geometry is complete, and
we may therefore
fairly say that
four
centuries
sufficed
to
complete it.
But some one will say, how did all this come about?
What
special aptitude had the Greeks for mathematics ?
The answer
to
this question
is
that
their
genius
for mathematics was
simply
one
aspect
of
their genius
for
philosophy.
Their
mathematics
indeed
constituted a large part of
their philo-
sophy down to Plato.
Both had the same origin.
Conditions favouring the development of philosophy
among the Greeks.
All men by nature
desire
to know,
says
Aristotle.^
The
Greeks, <beyond any other people of antiquity, possessed the
love of knowledge for its own sake
; with them
it amounted
to an instinct and a passion.^
We see this first of all in their
love
of
adventure.
It
is
characteristic
that
in the
Odyssey
Odysseus
is
extolled as the hero who had
' seen the
cities of
many men and learned their mind ',^ often even taking his life
in his hand, out of a pure passion for extending his horizon,

as when he went to see the Cyclopes in order to ascertain
' what
sort of people they were, whether violent and savage, with no

justice,
or
hospitable and
godfearing '.^
Coming
nearer to historical times, we iind philosophers and statesmen
travelling in order to benefit by
all
the wisdom that other
nations with a longer history had gathered during the
cen-
turies.
Thales
travelled
in Egypt and spent his time with
the priests.
Solon, according to Herodotus,^ travelled 'to see
the world'
(Oecopir]^ weKfy), going to Egypt to the court of
Amasis,' and visiting Croesus at Sardis.
At Sardis it was not
till
' after he had seen and examined everything
' that he had
the famous conversation with Croesus
; and Croesus addressed
him as the Athenian of whose wisdom and peregrinations he
had heard great accounts, proving that he had covered much
ground
in
seeing
the
world
and
pursuing
philosophy.
(Herodotus, also a great traveller,
is himself an instance of
the
capacity
of the
Greeks
for assimilating
anything
that
could
be
learnt
from
any
other
nations
whatever;
and,
although in Herodotus's case
the object in view was less the
pursuit of philosophy than the collection of interesting infor-
mation^ yet he exhibits in no
less degree the Greek passion
for seeing things as they are and discerning their meaning
and mutual relations ;
' he compares his reports, he weighs the
evidence, he
is conscious of his own office as an inquirer after
truth '.)
But
the
same
avidity
for learning
is best
of
all
illustrated by the similar tradition with regard to Pythagoras's
travels.
lamblichus, in his account of the life of Pythagoras,^
says that Thales, admiring his remarkable
abilitj^, communi-
cated to him'all that he knew, but, pleading his own age and
failing strength^ advised him for his better instruction to go
and study with the Egyptian
priests.
Pythagoras^ visiting
Sidon on
the way, both because
it was
his birthplace and
because he properly thought that the passage to Egypt would
be easier by that route, consorted there with the descendants
of Mochus, the natural philosopher and prophet, and with the
other
Phoenician
hierophants,
and was
initiated
into
all
the
rites
practised
in
Biblus,
Tyre, and
in many parts
of
Syria, a regimen to which he submitted, not out of religious

enthusiasm,
' as you might think
' (wy dv ns dnXm vnoXd^oi),
but much
more
through
love
and
desire
for
philosophic
inquiry, and in order to
secure that he should not overlook
any fragment of knowledge worth acquiring that might
lie
hidden
in
the
mysteries
or ceremonies
of
divine
worship
;
then, understanding that what he found in Phoenicia was in
some
sort an
offshoot or descendant
of
the wisdom of the
priests of Egypt, he concluded that he should acquire learning
more pure and more sublime by going to the fountain-head in
Egypt itself.
' There
', continues the
story,
' he studied with the priests
and prophets and instructed himself on every possible topic,
neglecting no
item of the
instruction favoured by the best
judges, no individual man among those who were famous for
their knowledge, no rite practised in the country wherever it
was, and leaving no place unexplored where he thought he
could
discover
something
more.
.
.
. And
so
he spent
22
years in the shrines throughout Egypt, pursuing astronomy
and geometry and, of set purpose and not by fits and starts or
casually, entering into all the rites of divine worship, until he
was
taken
captive by
Cambyses's force and
carried
off
to
Babylon, where again he consorted with the Magi, a willing
pupil of mlling masters.
By them he was fully instructed in
their solemn rites and religious worship, and in their midst he
attained to the highest eminence in arithmetic, music, and the
other branches of learning.
After twelve years more thus
spent he returned to Samos, being then about 56 years old.'
Whether
these
stories
are true in
their
details
or not
is
a matter of no consequence.
They represent the traditional
and universal view
of the Greeks themselves regarding the
beginnings of their philosophy, and they
reflect throughout
the Greek spirit and outlook.
From a scientific point of view a very important advantage
possessed by the Greeks was their remarkable capacity for
accurate observation.
This is attested throughout all periods,
by
the
similes
in Homer, by vase-paintings, by the
ethno-
graphic
data
in
Herodotus, by the
' Hippocratean
'
medical
books, by
the
biological
treatises
of
Aristotle, and
by the
history
of Greek astronomy in
all
its stages.
To take two
commonplace
examples.
Any
person
who
examines
the
under-side
of a horse's
hoof, which we
call a
' frog
' and the

6
INTRODUCTORY
Greeks
called
a
'swallow',
will
agree
that
the
latter
is
the more
accurate
description.
Or
again, what
exactness
of perception must have been possessed by the architects and
workmen to whom we owe the pillars which, seen from below,
appear perfectly straight,
but, when measured, are found
to
bulge out (evTaaii).
A still more essential fact
is that the Greeks were a race of
thinkers.
It was not enough for them to know the fact
(the
oTi)
; they wanted to know the why and wherefore (the
Slo. ti),
and they never rested until they were able to give a rational
explanation, or what appeared
to them to be
such, of every
fact
or phenomenon.
The history of Greek astronomy fur-
nishes a good example of this, as well as of the fact that no
visible phenomenon escaped
their observation.
We read in
Cleomedes^
that
there
were
stories
of
extraordinary
lunar
eclipses having been observed which
' the more ancient of the
mathematicians
' had vainly
tried
to explain
;
the supposed
' paradoxical
' case was that in which, while the sun appears
to be
still above the western horizon, the
eclipsed moon
is
seen
to
rise
in
the
east.
The phenomenon was
seemingly
inconsistent with the recognized explanation of lunar eclipses
as
caused
by
the
entrance
of
the moon
into
the
earth's
shadow
; how could
this be
if both
bodies were above
the
horizon
at the same time ?
The
' more ancient
' mathemati-
cians
tried
to argue
that
it was
possible
that
a
spectator
standing on
an eminence
of the
spherical
earth might
see
along the generators of a cone, i.e. a little downwards on all
sides instead
of merely in the plane
of the
horizon, and
so
might see both the sun and the moon although the latter was
in the earth's shadow.
Cleomedes denies this, and prefers to
regard
the whole
story
of such
cases
as a
fiction
designed
merely for the purpose of plaguing astronomers and philoso-
phers
;
but
it
is evident that
the
cases had
actually been
observed, and that astronomers did not cease to work at the
problem
until they had found
the
real explanation, namely
that the phenomenon
is due to atmospheric refraction, which
makes the sun visible to us though
it
is actually beneath the
horizon.
Cleomedes himself gives this explanation, observing
that
such
cases
of
atmospheric
refraction
were

noticeable
in the neighbourhood of the Black
Sea, and com-
paring the well-known experiment of the ring at the bottom
of a jug, where
the
ring, just out
of sight when the jug
is
empty, is brought into view when water is poured in.
We do
not know who the
' more ancient
' mathematicians were who
were first exercised by the
' paradoxical
' case
;
but
it seems
not impossible that it was the observation of this phenomenon,
and
the
difiiculty
of
explaining
it
otherwise, which made
Anaxagoras and others adhere
to the
theory that there are
other
bodies
besides
the
earth which
sometimes, by
their
interposition, cause lunar eclipses.
The story
is also a good
illustration
of the
fact
that,
with
the
Greeks,
pure
theory
went hand in hand with observation.
Observation gave data
upon which it was possible to found, a theory
; but the theory
had
to be modified from time
to time to
suit observed new
facts
; they had continually in mind the necessity of
' saving
the
phenomena'
(to
use
the
stereotyped
phrase
of Greek
astronomy).
Experiment
played
the
same
part
in
Greek
medicine and
biology.
Among the
diflerent Greek stocks the lonians who settled
on the coast of Asia Minor were the most favourably situated
in respect both of natural gifts and of environment for initiat-
ing philosophy and theoretical science.
When the colonizing
spirit first
arises in a nation and fresh fields for activity and
development
are
sought,
it
is naturally the
younger, more
enterprising and more
courageous' spirits who volunteer
to
leave
their homes and
try
their fortune
in new countries
;
similarly,
on
the
intellectual
side,
the
colonists
will be
at
least the equals
of those who stay
at home, and, being
the
least wedded to traditional and antiquated ideas, they will be
the most capable of striking out new lines.
So
it was with
the
Greeks who
founded
settlements
in
Asia
Minor.
The
geographical position of these settlements, connected with the
mother
country by
intervening
islands,
forming
stepping-
stones
as
it were from the one
to the
other, kept them
in
continual touch with
the mother country
; and
at
the same
time their geographical horizon was enormously extended by
the development of commerce over the whole of the Mediter-
ranean.
The most adventurous
seafarers among the Greeks
of Asia Minor, the Phocaeans, plied
their trade
successfully

INTRODUCTORY
as far as the Pillars of Hercules, after they had explored the
Adriatic
sea, the west coast of
Italy, and the
coasts of the
Ligurians
and
Iberians.
They
are
said
to
have
founded
Massalia, the most
important Greek colony in
the western
countries, as
earl}^ as 600 B. C.
Gyrene, on the Libyan
coast,
was founded
in the
last third of the seventh century.
The
Milesians had, soon
after 800 B.C., made settlements on the
east coast of the Black Sea (Sinope was founded in 785)
; Iho
first Greek settlements in
Sicily were made from Euboea and
Corinth soon after the middle of the eighth century (Syracuse
734).
The ancient acquaintance of the Greeks with the south
coast of Asia Minor and with Cyprus, and the establishment
of close
relations with Egypt, in which the Milesians had a
large share, belongs to the time of the reign of Psammetichus I
(664-610 B.C.), and many Greeks had settled in that country.
The
free communications thus
existing with
the whole of
the known world enabled complete information to be collected
with regard to the
different conditions, customs and
beliefs
prevailing in the various countries and rac^
; and, in parti-
cular,
the Ionian Greeks had
the inestimable advantage
of
being
in
contact,
directly and
indirectly, with two ancient
civilizations, the Babylonian and the Egyptian.
Dealing,
at
the
beginning
of
the
Metaphysics,
with
the
evolution
of
science,
Aristotle
observes
that
science
was
preceded by the
arts.
The arts were invented as the result
of general notions gathered from experience (which again was
derived from the exercise of memory)
;
those
arts naturally
came first which are directed to supplying the necessities of
life, and next came those which look to its amenities.
It was
only when all such arts had been established that the sciences,
which do not aim at supplying the necessities
or amenities
of
life, were
in turn
discovered, and
this happened
first in
the
places where men began to have
leisure.
This
is why
the mathematical arts were founded in Egypt
;
for there the
priestly caste was allowed to be at leisure.
Aristotle does not
here
mention
Babylon;
but,
such
as
it
was,
Babylonian
science also was the monopoly of the priesthood.
It
is in fact true, as Gomperz says,^ that the
first steps on
the road of scientific inquiry were, so far as we know from
'
Griechische Denker,
i, pp. 36, 37.

history, never accomplished except where the existence of an
organized caste of priests and
scholars secured the necessary-
industry, with the equally indispensable continuity of tradi-
tion.
But in those very places the first steps were generally
the last also, because the
scientific doctrines so attained tend,
through
their
identification with
religious
prescriptions,
to
become only too
easily, like the
latter, mere hfeless dogmas.
It was a
fortunate chance
for the unhindered
spiritual de-
velopment of the Greek people that, while their predecessors
in civilization had an organized priesthood, the Greeks never
had.
To begin with, they could exercise with perfect freedom
their power of unerring eclecticism in the assimilation of every
kind
of lore.
' It remains their everlasting glory that they
discovered and made use of the serious
scientific elements in
the confused and complex
mass
of exact observations
and
superstitious ideas which constitutes the priestly wisdom of
the
East, and threw
all the fantastic rubbish on one
side.' ^
For
the
same
reason,
while
using
the
earlier work
of
Egyptians
and
Babylonians
as
a
basis,
the
Greek
genius
could take an independent upward
course
free from every
kind of restraint and venture on a flight which was destined
to cany it to the highest achievements.
The Greeks then, with their
' unclouded clearness of mind
'
and their freedom of thought, untrammelled by any
' Bible
' or
its equivalent, were alone capable of creating the
sciences as
they did create them,
i.e. as living things based on sound first
principles and capable of indefinite development.
It was a
great boast, but a true one, which the author of the Epinomis
made when he said,
' Let us take it as an axiom that, whatever
the Greeks take from the barbarians, they bring it to
fuller
perfection '.^
He has been speaking of the extent to which
the Greeks had been able
to explain the relative motions and
speeds
of the sun, moon and planets, while admitting
that
there was
still much
progress
to be made
before
absolute
certainty could be achieved.
He adds a
characteristic sen-
tence, which is very relevant to the above remarks about the
Greek's free outlook
:
' Let no Greek ever be afraid that we ought not at any time
to study things divine because we are mortal.
We ought to

INTRODUCTORY
maintain
the
very eontiaiy view, namely,
that God cannot
possibly
be without
intelligence
or be ignorant
of human
nature
:
rather he knows
that, when he teaches them, men
will follow him and learn what they are taught.
And he
is
of course
perfectly aware that he does teach us, and that we
learn,
the very
subject we are now
discussing, number and
counting;
if he
failed
to know
this,
he would
show
the
greatest want of intelligence
;
the God we speak of would in
fact not know himself, if he took it amiss that a man capable
of learning should learn, and if he did not rejoice unreservedly
with one who became good by divine influence.'
Nothing could well show more clearly the Greek conviction
that there could be no opposition between religion and scien-
tific truth, and therefore that there could be no impiety in the
pursuit of truth.
The passage
is a good parallel to the state-
ment attributed to Plato that Oebs del yeoofJieTpei.
Meaning and
classification
of mathematics.
The words
fiaOrjfxaTa and
fiaOrj/MaTiKO^ do not appear
to
have been
definitely appropriated
to the special meaning of
mathematics and mathematicians or things mathematitjal until
Aristotle's time.
With Plato
jidOrjiia is quite general, mean-
ing any subject of instruction or study; he speaks of Koka
fiaO-qfjiaTa, good
subjects of instruction, as of KaXd
eTj-iTrjSev-
fiara, good pursuits, of women's subjects as opposed to men's,
of the Sophists hawking sound /laOij/xaTa
; what, he asks in
the Republic, are the greatest /ia6rj/j.aTa ? and he answers that
the greatest uddrifia
is the Idea
of the Good.^
But
in
the
Laws he speaks
of rpia
jxaOrjfiaTa,
three
subjects, as
fit for
freeborn men,
the
subjects being
arithmetic, the
science
of
measurement (geometry), and astronomy ^
;
and no doubt the
pre-eminent place given to mathematical subjects in his scheme
of education would have its effect in encouraging the habit of
speaking
of
these
subjects
exclusively
as
ixaOrjfiaTa.
The
Peripatetics, we
are
told,
explained
the
special
use
of
the
word in this way
; they pointed out that, whereas such things
as rhetoric and poetry and the whole of popular fiovcnK-q can
be understood even by one who has not learnt them, the sub-
jects called by the special name oi /laOrjuara cannot be known

by any one who has not first gone through a course of instruc-
tion in them
; they concluded that
it was for this reason that
these studies were called /xadrj/iaTLK^.^
The special use of the
word
jiaOrjjjLaTLKri seems
actually
to have
originated
in the
school
of Pythagoras.
It
is said that the
esoteric members
of
the
school,
those who had
learnt the
theory
of know-
ledge in its most complete form and with
all its elaboration
of
detail, were known
as
fiaO-qjiaTiKoi, mathematicians
(as
opposed to the dKovafiariKOL, the exoteric learners who were
entrusted, not with the inner theory, but only with the prac-
tical
rules
of
conduct)
;
and,
seeing
that
the
Pythagorean
philosophy was mostly mathematics, the term might
easily
come
to
be
identified
with
the
mathematical
subjects
as
distinct from
others.
According to Anatolius, the followers
of Pythagoras are said to have applied the term /xaOrj/xaTiK-i]
more
particularly
to
the
two
subjects
of
geometry
and
arithmetic, which had previously been known by their own
separate names
only and
not by any common
designation
covering both.^
There
is
also an
apparently genuine
frag-
ment of Archytas, a Pythagorean and a contemporary and
friend
of
Plato,
in
which
the word
/ladTJiiara
appears
as
definitely appropriated to mathematical subjects
:
' The mathematicians {toI nepl to. fiadrj/xaTa) seem to me to
have
arrived
at correct
conclusions,
ancl
it
is not therefore
surprising that they have a true conception of the nature of
each individual thing
:
for, having reached such
correct con-
clusions
regarding
the
nature
of
the
universe, they were
bound to see in its true light the nature of particular things
as well.
Thus they have handed down to us clear knowledge
about the speed of the
stars,
their
risings and
settings, and
about geometry, arithmetic, and sphaeric, and
last, not least,
about music
;
for these naBrjjiaTa seem to be sisters.' ^
This brings us to the Greek classification of the
different
branches of mathematics.
Archytas, in the passage quoted,
specifies
the four
subjects of the Pythagorean quadrivium,
geometry,
arithmetic, astronomy, and music
(for
'sphaeric'
means
astronomy,

sidered solely with reference to the problem of accounting for
the motions of the heavenly bodies)
; the same list of subjects
is attributed to the Pythagoreans by Nicomachus, Theon
of
Smyrna, and
Proclus, only in
a
different
order,
arithmetic,
music, geometry, and
sphaeric
;
the idea
in
this order was
that arithmetic and music were both concerned with number
{ttoo-ov), arithmetic with number in
itself, music with number
in relation to something else, while geometry and sphaeric were
both concerned with magnitude (tttjXikoi'), geometry with mag-
nitude at rest, sphaeric with magnitude in motion.
In Plato's
curriculum for the education of statesmen the same subjects,
with the addition of stereometry or
solid geometry, appear,
arithmetic
first, then geometry, followed by
solid geometry,
astronomy, and lastly harmonics.
The mention of stereometry
as an independent subject is Plato's own idea
;
it was, however,
merely
a
formal
addition
to
the curriculum,
for
of
course
solid problems had
been
investigated
earlier,
as
a part
of
geometry,
by
the
Pythagoreans,
Democritus
and
others.
Plato's reason for the interpolation was partly logical.
Astro-
nomy treats of the motion of solid bodies.
There is therefore
a gap between plane geometry and astronomy, for, after con-
sidering plane figures, we ought next to add the third dimen-
sion and consider solid figures in themselves, before passing
to the science which 'deals with such figures in motion.
But
Plato emphasized stereometry for another reason, namely that
in
his
opinion
it had
not been
. sufficiently
studied.
'The
properties of solids do not yet seem to have been discovered.'
He adds
:
' The reasons for this are two.
First, it is because no State
liolds them in honour that these problems, which are difficultj
are feebly investigated
; and, secondly, those who do investi-
gate them
are
in need
of a superintendent, without whos^
guidance they are not likely
to make
discoveries.
. But,
to
begin with,
jt
is
difiicult
to find such a superintendent, and
then, even supposing him found, as matters now stand, those
who are inclined
to these
researches would be prevented by
their self-conceit from paying any heed to him.'^

long as the director has not the authority of t)ie State behind

this seems to be the best interpretation in view of the
whole context
; but it
is possible, as a matter of construction,
to copnect the phrase with the preceding words, in which case
the meaning would be
' and, even when such a superintendent
has been found, as
is the case at present', and Plato would
be pointing to some distinguished geometer among his con-
temporaries as being actually available for the post.

this,
it would presumably
be
either Archytas
or
Eudoxus whom he had in mind.
It
is again on a logical ground that Plato made harmonics
or music follow astronomy in his classification.
As astronomy
is the motion of bodies ((popa^dOovs) and appeals
to the eye,
so there is a harmonious motion {evapfiovios
<popd), a motion,
according to the laws of harmony, which appeals
to the ear.
In maintaining the sisterhood of music and astronomy Plato
followed the Pythagorean view
(cf. the passage of Archytas
above
quoted
and
the
doctrine
of
the
' harmony
of
the
spheres ').
(a)
Arithmetic and
logistic.
By arithmetic Plato meant, not arithmetic in our sense, but
the science which considers numbers in themselves, in other
words, what we mean by the Theory of Numbers.
He does
not, however, ignore the art of calculation (arithmetic in our
sense);
he
speaks
of number and
calculation
{dpLOfibu
koI
Xoyidfiov) and observes that
' the art of calculation (XoyicrTiKri)
and arithmetic (dpiOfir]TLKrj) are both concerned with number ';
those who have a natural gift for calculation (ol
(pvaei Xoyi-
a-TLKoi) have,
generally speaking, a talent for learning of
all
kinds, and even
those who
are slow
are, by practice
in
it,
made smarter.^
But the art of calculation {XoyLa-.Tucq) is only
preparatory to the true science
; those who are to govern the
city
are
to
get
a
grasp
of
XoyiarLKri, not
in
the popular
i sense with a view to use in trade, but only for the purpose of
\ knowledge, until they are able to contemplate the nature of
number in itself by thought alone.^
.This distinction between

INTRODUCTORY
calculation) was a fundamental one
in Greek
mathematics.
It is found elsewhere in Plato,^ and it is clear that it was well
established
in
Plato's time.
Archytas too has
Xoyia-riKr]
in
the same sense
; the art of calculation, he says, seems to be far
ahead of other arts in
relation to wisdom or philosophy, nay
it seems to make the things of which it chooses to treat even
clearer than geometry does
; moreover, it often succeeds even
where geometry fails.^ But it is later writers on the classification
of mathematics who alone go into any detail of what Aoyicm/c^
included.
Geminus in Proclus, Anatolius in the Variae Collec-
tiones included in Hultsch's Hei'on, and the scholiast to Plato's
Charmides are our authorities.
Arithmetic, says Geminus,^ is
divided into the theory of linear numbers, the theory of plane
numbers, and the theory of
solid numbers.
It
investigates,
in and by themselves, the species of number as they are succes-
sively evolved from the unit, the formation of plane numbers,
similar and dissimilar, and the further progression to the third
dimension. As for the XoyicrTLKos, it is not in and by themselves
that he
considers the properties of numbers but with
refer-
ence
to
sensible
objects;
and for
this reason
he
applies
to
them names adapted from the objects measured, calling some
(numbers) /xrjXiTrjs (from
/j.fjXoi>, a sheep, or
ixfjXov, an
apple,
more probably the latter) and
others
(pLaXirrjs
(from
^idXr},
a bowl).*
The scholiast to the Charmides is fuller still
: ^
' Logistic
is the science which deals with numbered things,
not
numbers
;
it
does
not
take
number
in
its
essence,
but
it presupposes
1
as
unit, and
the numbered
object
as
number,
e.g.
it
regards
3
as
a
triad,
10
as
a
decad,
and
applies the theorems of arithmetic to such (particular)
cases.
Thus it is logistic which
investigates on the one hand what
Archimedes called the cattle-problem, and on the other hand
melites and 'phialites numbers,
the
latter relating to
bowls,
the former to flocks (he should probably have said " apples ");
in
other kinds
too
it
investigates
the numbers
of
sensible
bodies, treating them as absolute
(coy Trept TiXeiMv).
Its sub-
ject-matter
is
everything
that
is
numbered.
Its
branches
include the so-called Greek and Egyptian methods in
multi-
plications and
divisions,**
the
additions
and
decompositions

of
fractions
; which methods
it uses to explore the secrets of
the theory of triangular and polygonal numbers with reference
to the subject-matter of particular problems.'
The
content
of
logistic
is for the most part made fairly
clear by
the
schoha just
quoted.
First,
it
comprised
the
ordinary arithmetical operations, addition, subtraction, multi-
plication, division, and the handling of fractions
; that
is,
it
included the elementary parts of what we now call arithmetic.
Next,
it
dealt with
problems
about
such
things
as sheep
(or
apples), bowls,
&c.
;
and
here we have no
difficulty in
recognizing
such problems
as we
find
in
the
arithmetical
epigrams included in the Greek anthology.
Several of them
are problems of dividing a number of apples or nuts among
a certain number of persons
; others deal with the weights of
bowls, or of statues and
their pedestals, and the
like;
as a
rule, thej' involve the solution of simple equations with one
unknown, or easj' simultaneous equations with two unknowns;
two are indeterminate equations of the first degree to be solved
in positive integers.
From Plato's allusions to such problems
it
is clear that
their origin dates back, at least, to the fifth
century
B.C.
The
cattle-problem
attributed
to Archimedes
is of
course
a much
more
difficult problem, involving
the
solution
of
a
' Pellian
'
equation
in numbers
of
altogether
impracticable
size.
In
this problem
the sums
of two pairs
of unknowns have
to be
respectively a
square and a
tri-
angular
number;
the
problem
would
therefore
seem
to
correspond to the description of those involving
' the theory
of triangular and polygonal numbers'.
Tannery takes the
allusion
in the
last words
to
be
to
problems
in
indeter-
minate analysis like those of Diophantus's Arithmetica.
The
difficulty is that most of Diophantus's problems refer to num-
bers such that their sums, differences, &c., are squares, whereas
the scholiast mentions only triangular and polygonal numbers.
Tannery takes squares to be included among polygons, or to
have been accidentally oinitted by a
copyist.
But there
is
only one
use
in
Diophantus's
Arithmetica
of
a
triangular
number (in IV. 38), and none of a polygonal number; nor can
the Tpiycovovs of the scholiast refer, as Tannery supposes, to
right-angled
triangles with
sides
in
rational
numbers
(the
main subject of Diophantus's Book VI), the use of the mascu-

16
INTRODUCTORY
line showing that only rpiycovovs dpid/iov?, triangular nwm-
hers, can be meant.
Nevertheless there can, I think^ be no
doubt
that
Diophantus's
Arithnietica
belongs
to
Logistic.
Why then did Diophantus call his thirteen books Arithmetica ?
The explanation
is probably this.
Problems of the Diophan-
tine type,
like those of the arithmetical epigrams, had
pre-
viously
been
enunciated
of
concrete
numbers
(numbers
of
apples, bowls, &c.), and one of Diophantus's problems (V. 30)
is actually in epigram form, and
is about measures of wine
with prices in drachmas.
Diophantus then probably saw that
there was
no
reason why
such problems
should
refer
to
numbers of any one particular thing rather than another, but
that they might more conveniently take the form of finding
numbers in the
ahstgxict with certain properties, alone
or in
combination, and therefore that they might claim
to be part
of arithmetic, the abstract science or theory of numbers.
It should be added that
to the
distinction between arith-
metic and
logistic
there
corresponded
(up
to
the
time
of
Nicomachus)
different
methods
of
treatment.
With
rare
exceptions, such as Eratosthenes's koctkivov, or sieve, a device
for separating out the successive prime numbers, the theory
of numbers was only treated in connexion with geometry, and
for that reason only the geometrical form of proof was used,
whether the figures took the form of dots marking out squares,
triangles, gnomons, &c. (as with the early Pythagoreans), or of
straight
lines
(as
in
Euclid VII-IX)
; even Nicomachus did
not entirely banish geometrical considerations from his work,
and in Diophantus's treatise on Polygonal Numbers, of which
a fragment survives, the geometrical form of proof is used.
{^)
Geometry and geodaesia.
By the
time
of
Aristotle
there was
separated
out from
geometry
a
distinct
subject,
yecoSaiaia,
geodesy,
or,
as
we
should
sa.y, mensihration, not confined to land-measuring, but
covering generally the practical measurement of surfaces and
volumes, as we learn from Aristotle
himself,^ as well as from
a passage of Geminus quoted by Proclus.^

PHYSICAL SUBJECTS AND THEIR BRANCHES
l1
(y)
Physical
subjects, mechanics,
optics, harmonics,
astronomy, and
their branches.
In
applied
mathematics
Aristotle
recognizes
optics
and
mechanics in addition to astronomy and harmonics.
He calls
optics, harmonics, and astronomy the more physical (branches)
of mathematics/ and observes that these subjects and mechanics
depend
for
the proofs
of their
propositions upon the
pure
mathematical
subjects,
optics
on
geometry,
mechanics
on
geometry or stereometry, and harmonics on arithmetic
;
simi-
larly, he says, Phaenomena (that
is, observational astronomy)
depend on (theoretical) astronomy.
The most elaborate classification of mathematics is that given
by Geminus.^
After arithmetic and geometry, which treat of
non-sensibles, or objects of pure thought, come the branches
which are concerned with sensible
objects, and these are
six
in
number, namely
mechanics,
astronomy,
optics,
geodesy,
canonic {KavovcKri), logistic.
Anatolius distinguishes the same
subjects but gives them in the order logistic, geodesy, optics,
canonic, mechanics, astronomy.*
Logistic has already been
discussed.
Geodesy too has been described as onensuration,
the
practical
measurement
of
surfaces
and
volumes;
as
Geminus
says,
it
is the function of geodesy to measure^ not
a cylinder or a cone
(as such), but heaps as cones, and tanks
or pits as cylinders.^
Canonic
is the theory of the musical
intervals
as
expounded
in
works
like
Euclid's
KaraTo/ifj
Kavovos, Division of the canon.
Optics is divided by Geminus into three branches.''
(1) The
first is Optics proper, the business of which is to explain why
things
appear
to be
of
different
sizes
or
difierent
shapes
according
to
the way
in which
they
are
placed and
the
distances
at which they are
seen.
Euclid's
Optics
consists
mainly
of
propositions
of
this
kind;
a
circle
seen
edge-
wise looks like a straight line (Prop. 22), a cylinder seen by
one eye appears
less than
half a cylinder (Prop. 28);
if the
line joining the eye to the centre of a circle
is perpendicular

to the plane of the
circle,
all
its diameters
will look equal
(Prop. 34), but
if the joining
line
is neither perpendicular to
the plane of the circle nor equal
to its radius, diameters with
which it makes unequal angles will appear unequal (Prop. 35)
;
if a visible object remains stationary, there exists a locus such
that, if the eye is placed at any point on it, the object appears
to be of the same size for every position of the eye (Prop. 38),
(2) The second branch
is Catoptric, or the theory of mirrors,
exemplified
by
the
Catoptrica
of
Heron,
which
contains,
e. g., the theorem that the angles
of incidence and
reflexion
are
equal,
based
on
the
assumption
that
the broken
line
connecting
the
eye and
the
object
reflected
is a minimum.
(3) The third branch
is aKrjvoypacptKrj
or,
as we might say,
scene-painting,
i.e. applied perspective.
Under
the
general
term
of
mechanics
Geminus^
dis-
tinguishes (l) opyavoTTouKrj, the art of making engines of war
(cf. Archimedes's reputed feats at the siege
of Syracuse and
Heron's
/3eAo7roa'/ca),
(2)
6avfj.aTOTrouKi],
the
art
of making
luonderfid
machines,
such
as
those
described
in
Heron's
Pneumatica and Automatic
Theatre,
(3) Mechanics
proper,
the theory of centres of gravity, equilibrium, the mechanical
powers,
&c.,
(4) Sphere-making, the imitation of the move-
ments
of the heavenly bodies
; Archimedes
is
said
to have
made
such
a
sphere
or
orrery.
Last
of
all,^
astronomy
is divided into
(1) yucofioviKij, the art of the gnomon, or the
measurement
of
time
by
means
of
the
various
forms
of
sun-dials, such as those enumerated by Vitruvius,^ (2) fierecopo-
(TKOTTLKTi, which seems
to have included, among other things,
the measurement of the heights at which different stars cross
the meridian,

of
the dioptra for the
purpose
of
determining
the
relative
positions
of
the

Mathematics in Greek education.*
The elementary or primary stage in Greek education lasted
till
the age
of
fourteen.
The main
subjects were
letters
(reading and writing followed by dictation and the study of

literature), music and gymnastics
; but there is no reasonable
doubt
that
practical
arithmetic
(in
our
sense),
including
weights and measures, was taught along with these subjects.
Thus, at the stage
of spelling, a common question asked of
the pupils was, How many letters are there in sucH and such
a word, e.g. Socrates, and in what order do they come ?^
This
would teach the cardinal and ordinal numbers.
In the same
connexion Xenophon
adds,
' Or take
the
case
of
numbers.
Some one asks, What
is twice
five'?'^
This
indicates that
counting was a part of learning letters, and that the multipli-
cation
table was
a
closely connected
subject.
Then,
again,
there were certain games, played with cubic dice or knuckle-
bones, to which boys were addicted and which involved some
degree of arithmetical skill.
In the game of knucklebones in
the Lysis of Plato each boy has a large basket of them, and
the
loser in each game pays
so
manj?- over to the winner.^
Plato
connects the
art
of
playing
this game
with
mathe-
matics *
;
so too he
associates
treTTtia
(games
with
Trea-a-oi,
somewhat resembling draughts or chess) with arithmetic in
general.Â®
When in the Laivs Plato speaks of three subjects
fit for freeborn citizens to learn,
(1) calculation and the science
of numbers,
(2) mensuration in
one, two and
three dimen-
sions, and
(3) astronomy in the
sense of the knowledge of
the revolutions of the heavenly bodies and
their respective
periods, he admits that profound and accurate knowledge of
these subjects is not for people in general but only for a few.^
But
it
is evident that
practical arithmetic was, after letters
and the lyre, to be a subject for
all, so much of arithmetic,
that
is,
as
is
necessary
for
purposes
of
war,
household
management, and the work of government.
Similarly, enough
astronomy should be learnt to enable the pupil to understand
the calendar.'^
Amusement should be combined with instruc-
tion so as to make the subjects attractive to boys.
Plato was
much attracted by the Egyptian practice in this matter
: ^
' Freeborn boys
should learn so much of these things as
vast
multitudes
of boys
in Egypt

INTRODUCTORY
letters.
First there should be
calculations
specially devised
as suitable for boys, which they should learn with amusement
and pleasure, for
" example, distributions of apples or garlands
where the same number is divided among more or fewer boys,
or
(distributions)
of the competitors in boxing or wrestling
matches on the plan of drawing pairs with byes, or by taking
them in consecutive order, or in any of the usual ways ^
; and
again
there should
be games with
bowls
containing
gold,
bronze, and silver (coins?) and the like mixed together,^ or the
bowls may be distributed as undivided units
;
for, as
I
said,
by connecting with games the essential operations of practical
arithmetic, you supply the boy with what will be useful to
Jiim
later in the ordering of armies, marches and campaigns,
as well
as in household management; and in any case you
make him
more
useful
to
himself and
more wide
awake.
Then
again, by
calculating
measurements
of
things
which
have
length, breadth, and
depth, questions on
all of which
the natural condition of
all men is one of ridiculous and
dis-
graceful
ignorance,
they
are
enabled
to emerge from
this
state.'
It
is
true
that
these
are
Plato's
ideas of what elementary
education should include
; but
it can hardly be doubted that
such methods were actually in use in Attica.
Geometry and astronomy belonged to secondary education,
which occupied the years between the ages of fourteen and
eighteen.
The pseudo-Platonic Axiochus attributes to Prodi-
cus a statement that, when a boy gets older,
i. e. after he has

So
far as
I can ascertain, iv
fj-ipei (by itself) and
i^e^fjs have always been taken
as indicating alternative methods,
' in turn and in consecutive
order'.
But it is impossible to get any satisfactory contrast of meaning between
' in turn
' and
' in consecutive order
'.
It
is clear to me that we have
here merely an instance of Plato's habit of changing the order of words
for effect, and that ev fxtpei must be taken with the genitives e(p(tpeias ml
avWrj^fojs
;
i. e. we must translate as

This gives a proper distinction
between (1) drawings with byes and (2) taking competitors in consecutive

passed the primary stage under the paidagogos, grammatistes,
and paidotribes, he comes under the tyranny of the
' critics ',
the
geometers,
the
tacticians, and a host
of
other
masters.^
Teles,
the
philosopher,
similarly,
mentions
arithmetic and
geometry among the plagues of the
lad.^
It would appear
that geometry and astronomy were newly introduced into the
curriculum in the time of Isocrates.
' I am so far
', he says,^
' from despising the instruction which our ancestors got, that
I am a supporter of that which has been established in our
time, I mean geometry, astronomy, and the
so-called
eristic
dialogues.'
Such
studies, even
if they do no
other
good,
keep the young out of mischief, and in Isocrates's opinion no
other
subjects
could
have
been
invented more
useful
and
more fitting
; but they should be abandoned by the time that
the pupils have reached man's
estate.
Most people, he
says,
think them idle, since (say they) they are of no use in private
or public affairs
; moreover they are forgotten directly because
they do not go with us in our daily life and action, nay, they
are altogether outside everyday needs.
He himself, however,
is far from sharing these views.
True, those who specialize in
such subjects as astronomy and geometry get no good from
them unless they choose to teach them for a livelihood
; and if
they get too deeply absorbed, they become
unpractical and
incapable of doing ordinary business
; but the study of these
subjects up to the proper point trains a boy to keep his atten-
tion fixed and not
to allow
his mind to wander
;
so, being
practised in this way and having his wits sharpened, he will be
capable of learning more important matters with greater ease
and speed.
Isocrates will not give the name of
' philosophy
' to
studies like geometry and astronomy, which are of no imme-
diate use for producing an orator or man of business
; they
are rather means of training the mind and a preparation for
philosophy.
They are a more manly discipline than the sub-
jects taught to boys, such as literary study and music, but in
other respects have the same function in making them quicker
to learn greater and more important subjects.

INTRODUCTORY
It would appear
therefore
that, notwithstanding
the
in-
fluence of
Plato, the
attitude of cultivated people in general
towards mathematics was not
different in
Plato's time from
what it is to-day.
We
are
told that
it was one of the
early Pythagoreans,
unnamed, who first taught geometry for money
:
' One of the
Pythagoreans
lost
his
property,
and when
this
misfortune
befell him
he
was
allowed
to make
money by
teaching
geometry.' ^
We may
fairly conclude
that
Hippocrates
of
Chios, the
first writer of Elements, who
also made
himself
famous by
his
quadrature
of
lunes,
his
reduction
of
the
duplication of the cube to the problem of finding two mean
proportionals, and
his proof that the areas of
circles are
in
the ratio of the squares on
their diameters,
also taught for
money and for a like reason.
One version of the story is that
he was a merchant, but
lost
all his propertjr through being
captured by
a
pirate
vessel.
He then came to Athens
to
prosecute
the
offenders
and,
during a long
stay, attended
lectures, finally attaining such proficiency in geometry that
he
tried
to square the
circle.^
Aristotle
has
the
different
version that he allowed himself to be defrauded of a
large
sum by custom-house
officers
<at Byzantium, thereby proving,
in
Aristotle's opinion, that, though a good geometer, he was
stupid and incompetent in the business of ordinary life.^
We find in the Platonic dialogues one or two glimpses
of
mathematics being taught or discussed
in
school- or
class-
rooms.
In the Erastae * Socrates is represented as going into
the school of Dionysius (Plato's own schoolmaster ^) and find-
ing two
lads
earnestly arguing some
point
of astronomy;

younger
Socrates thinking whether
it was not
possible
to
comprehend all such surds under one definition.
In these two
cases we have advanced or selected pupils discussing among
themselves the subject of lectures they had heard and, in the
second
case, trying
to develop
a theory
of
a more
general
character.
But mathematics was not only taught by regular masters
in schools; the
Sophists, who travelled from place
to place
giving lectures, included mathematics
(arithmetic, geometry,
and astronomy) in
their very wide
list of
subjects.
Theo-
doras,
who
was
Plato's
teacher
in
mathematics
and
is
described
by
Plato
as
a
master
of
geometry,
astronomy,
logistic and music (among
other
subjects),
was a
pupil
of
Protagoras, the Sophist, of Abdera.^
Protagoras himself, if we
may trust
Plato, did not approve of mathematics as part of
secondary education
; for he is made to say that
' the other Sophists maltreat the young, for, at an age when
the young have escaped the arts, they take them against their
will and plunge them once more into the arts, teaching them
the art of calculation, astronomy, geometry, and musicâ€”and
here he cast a glance at Hippiasâ€”whereas, if any one comes
to me, he will not be obliged to learn anything except what
he comes for.' ^
The Hippias referred to is of course Hippias of Elis, a really
distinguished mathematician, the inventor of a curve known
as the quadratrix which, originally intended for the solution
of the problem of
trisecting any angle,
also served
(as the
name implies) for squaring the circle.
In the Hijjpias Minor'^
there
is
a description of Hippias's
varied accomplishments.
He claimed, according to this passage, to have gone once
to
the Olympian festival with everything that he wore made by
himself,
ring and
seal (engraved),
oil-bottle,
scraper,
shoes,
clothes, and a Persian girdle of expensive type
; he also took
poems,
epics,
tragedies, dithyrambs, and
all
sorts
of
prose
works.
He
was
a
master
of
the
science
of
calculation
(logistic),
geometry,
astronomy,
' rhythms
and
harmonies
and
correct writing'.
He
also had
a wonderful system of
mnemonics enabling him,
if he once heard a string of
fifty

INTRODUCTORY
names, to remember them
all.
As a
detail, we
are told that
he got no fees for his lectures in Sparta, and that the Spartans
could
not
endure
lectures
on
astronomy
or
geometry
or
logistic
;
it was only
a
small minority of them who could
even count
; what they liked was history and archaeology.
The above
is almost
all that we know
of the part played
by mathematics in the Greek system
of education.
Plato's
attitude towards mathematics was, as we have
seen, quite
exceptional
; and it was no doubt largely owing to his influence
and his inspiration that mathematics and astronomy were so
enormously advanced in his school, and especially by Eudoxus
of Cnidos and Heraclides of Pontus.
But the popular
atti-
tude towards
Plato's style of lecturing was not encouraging.
There
is a story
of a lecture
of his on
' The Good
' which
Aristotle was fond of
telling.^
The lecture was attended by
a great ci'owd, and
' every one went there with the idea that
he would be put in the way of getting one or other of the
things in human
life which are usually accounted good, such
as Riches, Health, Strength, or, generally, any extraordinary
gift of fortune.
But when they found that Plato discoursed
about mathematics, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, and
finally declared the One to be the Good, no wonder they were
altogether taken by surprise
; insomuch
that in the end some
of the audience were inclined to scoff at the whole thing, while
others objected to it altogether.'
Plato, however, was able to
pick and choose
his pupils, and he could therefore insist on
compliance with the notice which he is said to have put over
his porch,
' Let no one unversed in geometry enter my doors
'
; ^
and similarly Xenocrates, who, after Speusippus, succeeded to
the headship of the school, could turn away an applicant for
admission who knew no geometry with the words,
' Go thy
way,
for
thou
hast
not
the
means
of
getting
a
grip
of
philosophy '.^
The
usual
attitude towards mathematics
is illustrated by
two
stories of Pythagoras and Euclid respectively.
Pytha-
goras, we are told,* anxious as he was to transplant to his own
country the system of education which he had seen in opera-

tion in
Egypt, and the study of mathematics in
particular,
could get none of the Samians to listen to him.
He adopted
therefore
this
plan
of
communicating
his
arithmetic
and
geometry, so that
it might not perish with him.
Selecting
a young man who from his behaviour in gymnastic exercises
seemed adaptable and was withal poor, he promised him that,
if he would learn arithmetic and geometry systematically, he
would give him sixpence for each
' figure
' (proposition) that he
mastered.
This went on
until the youth got
interested
in
the subject, when Pythagoras rightly judged that he would
gladly go on
without
the
sixpence.
He
therefore
hinted
that he himself was poor and must try to earn his daily bread
instead of doing mathematics
; whereupon the youth, rather
than give up the study, volunteered to pay sixpence himself
to Pythagoras
for each
proposition.
We must presumably
connect with this story the Pythagorean motto,
' a figure and
a platform (from which to ascend to the next higher step), not
a figure and sixpence '}
The other
story
is that of a
pupil who
began
to
learn
geometry with Euclid and asked, when he had
learnt one
proposition, 'What advantage
shall
I get by learning these
things 1
'
And Euclid called the
slave and
said,
' Give him
sixpence, since he must needs gain by what he learns.'
We gather that the education of kings in the Macedonian
period did not include much geometry, whether it was Alex-
ander who asked Menaechmus, or Ptolemy who asked Euclid,
for a short-cut to geometry, and got the reply that
' for travel-
ling over the country there are royal roads and roads for com-
mon citizens
: but in geometry there is one road for all '.^

II
GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION AND ARITH-
METICAL OPERATIONS
The decimal system.
The Greeks, from the earliest historical times, followed the
decimal
system
of
numeration,
which
had
already
been
adopted by civilized peoples
all the world over.
There
are,
it
is true, traces of quinary reckoning (reckoning in terms of
five) in very early times
; thus in Homer TrejiTrd^eiv (to
' five ')
is used for
' to count '}
But the counting by fives was pro-
bably little more than auxiliary to counting by tens
;
five was
a natural halting-place between the unit and ten, anci the use
of five times a particular power of ten as a separate category
intermediate between
that
power and
the next was found
convenient in the earliest form of numerical symbolism estab-
lished in
Greece, just
as
it was in the Roman
arithmetical
notation.
The reckoning by five does not amount to such a
variation
of
th-e decimal system
as
that which was
in
use
among the Celts and Danes; these
peoples had a vigesimal
system, traces of which are
still
left in the French
quatre-
vingts,
quatre-vingt-treize,
&c., and
in our
score, three-score
and ten, twenty-one, &c.
The natural explanation of the origin of the decimal system,
as
well
as
of
the quinary and
vigesimal
variations,
is
to
suppose that they were suggested by the primitive practice of
reckoning with the
fingers,
first of one hand, then
of both
together, and after that with the ten toes in addition (making
up the 20 of the vigesimal system).
The subject was mooted
in the Aristotelian Problems,^ where it is asked
'Why do
all men, whether barbarians or Greeks, count up
to ten, and not up to any other number, such as
2,
3, 4, or 5,
so
that,
for example, they do not
say
one-|)Ztts-five
(for
6),
1 Homer, Od. iv. 412.
^ ^v. 3, 910 b 23-911 a 4.

THE DECIMAL SYSTEM
27
two-|;/!us-five (for 7), as they say one-^J^ws-ten {efSeKa, for 11),
two-plus-ten
(SciSeKa, for
12), while on the other hand they
do not go beyond ten for the first halting-place from"which to
start again repeating the units'?
For of course any number
is the next before
it plus
1, or the next before that plus
2,
and so with those preceding numbers
; yet men fixed definitely
on ten as the number to count up
to.
It cannot have been
chance
;
for chance will not account for the same thing being
done always
: what is always and universally done
is not due
to chance but to some natural cause.'
Then,
after
some
fanciful
suggestions
(e.g.
that
10
is a
' perfect number '), the author proceeds
:
' Or
is
it because men were born with ten fingers and
so,
because they possess the. equivalent of pebbles to the number
of their own
fingers, come to use this number for counting
everything else as well ?
Evidence for the truth of this latter view is forthcoming in
the number of cases where the word for 5
is either the same
as, or connected with, the word for
' hand
'.
Both the Greek
X^tp and the Latin manus are used to denote
' a number
' (of
men).
The author of the so-called geometry of Boetius says,
moreover, that the ancients called
all the numbers below ten
by the name digits
(' fingers ').^
Before entering on a description of the Greek numeral signs
it
is proper to refer briefly to the systems of notation used
by
their
forerunners
in
civilization,
the
Egyptians
and
Babylonians.
Egyptian numerical notation.
The Egyptians had a purely decimal system, with the signs
I
for the unit, n for
10,
(2 for
100, | for 1,000, ] for
10,000,
"^^
for
100,000.
The number
of
each
denomination was
expressed by repeating the sign that number of times
; when
the number was more than 4 or 5, lateral space was saved by
arranging them
in two or three rows, one above the
other.
The greater denomination came before the smaller.
Numbers
could be written from
left to right or from right to left
;
in
the latter case the above signs were turned the opposite way.
The fractions in use were
all submultiples or single aliquot

had a special

Pi^P,
Babylonian systems,
(a) Decimal.
(jS)
Sexagesimal,
The ancient Babylonians had two systems of numeration.
The one was
purely decimal based on
the following
signs.
The simple wedge T i-epresented the unit, which was repeated
up
to nine times: where there were more than
three, they
were placed
in two or three rows, e.g. W =
4, yty =7.
10
was represented by ^;
11 would therefore be /Y
.
100 had
the compound sign
T>-, and 1000 was expressed as
10 hun-
dreds, by ^T*^, the prefixed / (10) being here
multiplicative.
Similarly, the \T*- was regarded as one sign, and ^Cf*- de-
noted not 2000 but 10000, the prefixed \ being again multi-
plicative.
Multiples
of 10000 seem
to have been expressed
as multiples of
1000;
at
least, 120000 seems to be attested
in the form 100.1000
-f- 20.1000.
The absence of any definite
unit above 1000
(if
it was really absent) must have rendered
the system very inconvenient as a means of expressing large
numbers.
Much
more
interesting
is the
second' Babylonian system
the
sexagesimal.
This
is
found,
in
use
on
the
Tables
oi
Senkereh, discovered by W. K. Loftus in 1854, which may gc
back as far as the time between 2300 and 1600 B.C.
In
this
system numbers above the units (which go from
1 to 59) are
arranged according
to powers
of
60.
60
itself was
callec
sussu
{ â€” soss), 60^ was called sar, and there was a name alsc
(ner) ior the intermediate number
10.60 = 600.
The
multi-
ples of the several powers of 60, 60^ 60^, &c., contained in the
number to be written down were expressed by means of
the
same wedge-notation as served for the
units, and the multi
pies were placed
in columns side by side, the columns bein^
appropriated to the successive powers of
60.
The unit-tern

was followed by similar columns appropriated, iu order, to the
successive submultiples â€”

Simi-

the
latter
case
also
shows
that
the
Babylonians, on occasion, used the subtractive plan, for the 27
is here written 30 minus
3.
The
sexagesimal system only required a
definite symbol
for
(indicating the absence of a particular denomination),
and a fixed arrangement of columns, to become a complete
position-value system
like the Indian.
With a sexagesimal
system
would occur comparatively seldom, and the Tables of
Senkereh
do
not show a
case
;
but from other
sources
it
appears that a gap often indicated a zero, or there was a sign
used
for the purpose, namely
i, called
the
'divider'.
The
inconvenience of the system was that
it required a multipli-
cation table extending from
1 times
1 to 59 times 59.
It had,
however, the advantage that it furnished an easy means of
expressing
very
large
numbers.
The
researches
of
H.
V.
Hilprecht
show
that
60* = 12,960,000
played
a
prominent
part
in Babylonian
arithmetic, and he found
a
table
con-
taining
certain
quotients
of
the
number
T^
= 608+10.60'', or 195,955,200,000,000.
Since the number of
units of any denomination are expressed in the purely decimal
notation, it follows that the latter system preceded the sexa-
gesimal.
What circumstances led
to the adoption of 60 as
the base can only be conjectured, but it may be presumed that
the authors of the system were fully alive to the convenience
of a base with so many
divisors; combining
as
it does
the
advantages of 12 and 10.

We find, in Greek inscriptions of
all dates, instances of numbers and values written out in full
;
but
the inconvenience
of
this longhand,
especially in such
things as accounts, would soon be
felt, and
efforts would be
made
to
devise
a scheme
for
representing numbers more

30
GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
concisely by means of conventional signs of some
sort.
The
Greeks conceived the original idea' of using the letters of the
ordinary Greek alphabet for this purpose.
(a)
The
' Herodianic
'
signs.
There were two main systems of numerical notation in use in
classical
times.
The
first, known
as
the Attic system and
used for cardinal numbers exclusively, consists of the
set of
signs somewhat absurdly called
' Herodianic
' because they are
described
in
a fragment^
attributed
to
Herodian, a gram-
marian
of
the
latter
half of
the second century a.d.
The
authenticity of
the fragment
is
questioned, but the writer
says that he has seen the signs used in Solon's laws, where
the prescribed pecuniary
fines were stated
in this notation,
and that they are also to be found in various ancient inscrip-
tions,
decrees and
laws.
These
signs
cannot
claim
to be
numerals in the proper sense; they are mere compendia or
abbreviations;
for, except in the case of the stroke
I repre-
senting a unit, the signs are the first letters of the full words
for the numbers, and
all numbers up to 50000 were repre-
sented by combinations of
these
signs.
I, representing the
unit, may be repeated up to four times
; P (the first letter of
Treire)
stands
for
5, A (the
first
letter
of
SfKa)
for
10,
H
(representing
eKarov)
for
100,
X
(x^'AfOi)
for
1000, and M
{fivpioL)
for
10000.
The
half-way
numbers
60,
500,
5000
were expressed by combining P
(five) with the other signs
respectively;
P,
F,
P, made up
of P
(5) and A
(10), = 50;
P, made up of P and
H, = 500
; P = 5000
; and P = 60000.
There are thus six simple and four compound symbols, and all
other numbers intermediate between those so represented are
made up by juxtaposition on an additive
basis, so that each
of the simple signs may be repeated not more than four times
the higher numbers come
before
the
lower.
For example,
PI =6, Aim = 14, HP = 105, XXXXP'HHHHPAAAAPIIII
= 4999.
Instances of this system of notation are found in
Attic inscriptions from 454 to about 96 B.C.
Outside Attica
the same system was in
use, the precise form of the symbols
varying with the form of the
letters in the
local alphabets.
Thus in Boeotian inscriptions P or P" = 60, fÂ£= 100, r>E =600
1 Printed in the Appendix to Stephanus's Thesaurus, vol. viii.

THE 'HERODIANIC SIGNS
31
y = 1000,
jr'='5000;
and f I7Â£l-Efâ‚¬|-Et>>lll = 5823.
But,
in consequence of the political influence of Athens, the Attic
system, sometimes with unimportant modifications, spread to
other states.^
In a similar manner compendia were used to denote units
of coinage or of weight.
Thus in Attica l=^TciXavTov (6000
drachmae),
M = fiva
(1000
drachmae),
Z
or
^ = a-Tar^p
(l/3000th of a talent or 2 drachmae), h = SpaxiJ-V,
I = 6/3oX6y
(l/6th of a drachma), C = ^jiicolBiXiov (l/12th of a drachma),
3
or T = TerapTTjixopiov
(l/4th of an
obol
or
l/24th
of
a
drachma),
X = xaA'coOy
(l/8th
of
an
obol
or
l/48th
of
a
drachma).
Where a number of one of these units has to be
expressed, the sign for the unit
is written on the left of that
for the number; thus
1-PAI = 61 drachmae.
The two com-
pendia for the numeral and the unit are often combined into
one
;
e.g.
fP, m = 5
talents, ^ = 50
talents, H = 100
talents,
n^= 500 talents, ^= 1000 talents. A = 10 minas, P= 6 drach-
mae, ^, i^, ^= 10 staters, &c.
(/3)
The ordinary alphabetic numerals.
The second main system, used for all kinds of numerals, is
that with which we
are
familiar,
namely
the
alphabetic
system.
The
Greeks
took
their
alphabet from
the Phoe-
nicians.
The Phoenician alphabet contained 22
letters, and,
in
appropriating
the
different
signs,
the
Greeks had
the
happy
inspiration
to
use
for the vowels, which were not
written in Phoenician, the signs for certain spirants for which
the Greeks had no use
; Aleph became A, He was used for E,
Yod
for
I, and Ayin
for O
;
when,
later,
the long E was
differentiated,
Cheth
was
used,
B
or
H.
Similarly
they
utilized
superfluous
signs
for
sibilants.
Out
of Zayin and
Samech they made the letters Z and H.
The remaining two
sibilants were Ssade and Shin.
From
the
latter came the
simple Greek 2
(although the name Sigma seems
to
corre-
spond to the Semitic Samech, if
it is not simply the
' hissing
letter, from
ai^co).
Ssade, a softer sibilant
(= o-o-), also called
San
in
early
times, was
taken over by the Greeks
in the
place
it occupied after n, and written in the form M
or
v\.
The form T
(â€” era-) appearing in inscriptions of Halicarnassus

i, p. 417.

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
(e.g. 'AXtKapvaTlecoi'] â€” 'AkiKa.pvaiii(i>v) and Teos ([^JaAaT?;?
cf. OdXaiiav in another place) seems to be derived from some
form
of
Ssade;
this T,
after
its
disappearance
from
the
literary alphabet, remained
as
a numeral,
passing through
the forms /\, m, P,
<^, and "p to the fifteenth century form \
to which in the second half of
the seventeenth century the
name Sampi was applied (whether as being the San which
followed Pi or from its resemblance to the cursive form of tt).
The original Greek alphabet also i^etained the Phoenician Vau (f)
in its proper place between E and Z and the Koppa= Qoph (9)
immediately before
P.
The Phoenician alphabet ended with
T
;
the Greeks
first added T, derived from Vau apparently
(notwithstanding the retention of
F), then the letters ^, X, ^
and,
still
later,
il.
The
27
letters
used
for
numerals
are
divided
into
three
sets
of nine
each;
the
first nine denote
the units,
1,
2,
3, &c., up to 9
; the second nine the tens, from
10 to 90; and the third nine the hundreds, from 100 to 900.
The following is the scheme
:
A
=
1
I = 10
B
=2
K = 20
r
=3
A = 30
A
= 4
M = 40
E
=
5
N = 50
C
[5-] = 6
Z = 60
Z
=7
O = 70
H
=8
n = 80
e
= 9
O = 90
The
sixth
sign
in
the
first column
(C)
is
a
form
of
the
digamma F F.
It came, in the seventh and eighth centuries
A. D., to be written in the form
Cj and then, from its similarity
to the cursive t (= err), was called Stigma.
This use of the
letters of
the
alphabet
as numerals was
original with the Greeks
; they did not derive
it from the
Phoenicians, who never used
their alphabet
for
numerical
purposes but had separate signs
for numbers.
The
earliest
occurrence of numerals written in this way appears to be in
a Halicarnassian inscription of date not long after 450 B.C.
Two caskets from the ruins of a famous mausoleum built at
Halicarnassus in 351
B.C., which are attributed
to the time
of
Mausolus, about 350
B.C., are
inscribed with

reproduced from the original list, has the terms of office of the
several priests stated on
the alphabetical system.
Again, a
stone inscription found at Athens and perhaps belonging
to
the
middle of the fourth century B.C. has, in
five fragments
of columns, numbers in tens and units expressed on the same
system, the tens on the right and the units on the left.
There is a difference of opinion as to the approximate date
of
the
actual
formulation
of
the
alphabetical
system
of
numerals.
According to one view, that of
Larfeld,
it must
have been introduced much earlier than the date (450 B.C. or
a little later) of the Halicarnassus inscription, in fact as early
as the end of the eighth century, the place of its origin being
Miletus.
The argument
is
briefly
this.
At the time of the
invention of the system all the letters from A to H, including
F and 9
in
their
proper
places, were
still
in
use,
while
^sade (T, the double
ss) had dropped out
;
this
is why the
last-named
sign
(afterwards
'^) was
put
at
the
end.
If
C (= 6) and 9 (= 90) had been no longer in use as
letters,
they too would have been put, like
Ssade, at the end.
The
place of origin of the numeral system must have been one
in
which the current alphabet corresponded to the content and
order
of the alphabetic numerals.
The
order
of
the
signs
0,
X, t shows
that
it was one
of
the
Eastern group
of
alphabets.
These
conditions are
satisfied by one
alphabet,
and one only, that of Miletus, at a stage which still recognized
the Vau
(F) as well as the Koppa (9).
The 9
is found along
with the
so-called
complementary
letters
including
H,
the
latest of
all, in the oldest inscriptions of the Milesian colony
Naucratis
(about
650
B.C.);
and,
although
there
are
no
extant Milesian
inscriptions containing the
F, there
is at
all
events one
very early example of F in
Ionic, namely
'Aya-
cnXeFo
{'AyaaiXijFov) on a vase in the Boston (U.S.) Museum
of Fine Arts belonging
to the end of the eighth or
(at latest)
the
middle
of
the
seventh
century.
Now,
as H
is
fully
established
at the date of the
earliest inscriptions at Miletus
(about 700
B.C.) and Naucratis (about 650
B.C.),
the
earlier

34
GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
exteTision of the alphabet by the
letters
<J) X t must have
taken
place not
later than
750 B.C.
Lastly, the presence in
the alphabet of the Van indicates a time which can hardly
be put later than 700 B.C.
The
conclusion
is
that
it was
about
this time,
if not
earlier, that the numerical alphabet
was invented.
The other view is that of Keil, who holds that it originated
in
Dorian
Caria,
perhaps
at
Halicarnassus
itself,
about
550-425
B.C.,, and that
it was
artificially put together
by
some one who had the necessary knowledge
to enable him
to
fill up
his own alphabet, then
consisting of twenty-four
letters only, by taking over F and 9 from other alphabets and
putting them
in their proper places, while he completed the
numeral
series
by
adding T
at
the
end.^
Keil
urges,
as
against
Larfeld,
that
it
is improbable that F
and
il
ever
existed together in the Milesian alphabet.
Larfeld's answer ^
is that, although F had disappeared from ordinary language
at Miletus towards the end of the eighth century, we cannot
say exactly when it disappeared, and even if it was practically
gone at the time of the formulation of the numerical alphabet,
it would be
in
the
interest of instruction in
schools, where
Homer was read, to keep the letter as long as possible in the
official alphabet.
On the other hand,
Keil's argument is open
to the
objection that,
if
the Carian inventor
could
put the
F and 9 into their proper places in the series, he would hardly
have failed to put the Ssade T in its proper place also, instead
of at the
end, seeing that T
is found in Caria itself, namely
in a Halicarnassus (Lygdamis)
inscription of about 453
B.C.,
and also in Ionic Teos about 476
b.c.^ (see pp. 31-2 above).
It was a long time before the alphabetic numerals found
general acceptance.
They were not
officially used
until the
time of the Ptolemies, when it had become the practice to write,
in inscriptions and on coins, the year of the reign of the ruler
'
for the time being.
The conciseness of the signs made them
particularly suitable for use on coins, where space was limited.
When coins went about the world, it was desirable that the
notation
should be
uniform, instead
of depending on
local
alphabets, and it only needed the support of some paramount

THE ORDINARY ALPHABETIC NUMERALS

political authority to secure the. final triumph oi' the alphabetic
system.
The alphabetic numerals are found
at Alexandria
on
coins
of Ptolemy
II,
Philadelphus, assigned
to
266
B.C.
A coin with the
inscription 'AXe^dvSpov KA
(twenty-fourth
year after Alexander's death) belongs, according to
Keil,
to
the end of the third century.^
A very old Graeco-Egyptian
papyrus
(now
at
Leyden,
No.
397),
ascribed
to
257
B.C.,
contains the number
k6 = 29.
While
in
Boeotia the
Attic
system was in use in the middle of the third century, along
with the corresponding local system, it had to give way about
200 B.C. to the alphabetic system, as is shown by an^inventory
from
the temple
of Amphiaraus
at Oropus ^
; we have here
the first ofiieial use of the alphabetic system in Greece proper.
From
this time Athens stood alone in retaining the archaic
system, and had sooner or
later to come into line with other
states.
The
last certainly attested use of the Attic notation
in Athens was about
95 B.C.; the alphabetic numerals were
introduced there some time before 50 B.C., the first example
belonging to the time
of Augustus, and by a.d. 50 they were
in official use.
The two systems are found
side by side
in a number
of
papyrus-rolls found at Herculaneum
(including
the
treatise
of Philodemus De pietate, so that the rolls cannot be older than
40 or 50 B.C.);
these state on the title page, after the name of
the author, the number of books in alphabetic numerals, and
the number of lines in the Attic notation, e.g. ETTIKOYPOY
|
nEPI
I OYZEnZ
I IE aped
.
.
XXXHH (where IE = 15 and
XXXHH = 3200), just
as we commonly use Roman
figures
to denote Books and Arabic figures for sections or lines?
> Hermes, 29, 1894, p. 276 Â«.
' Keil in Hermes, 25, 1890, pp. 614-15.
' Reference should be made, in passing, to another, gMasi-numerical,
use of the
letters of the ordinary alphabet, as current at the time, for
numbering particular things.
As early as the
fifth century we find in
a Locrian
bronze-inscription the
letters A to Â® (including f then and
there current) used to distinguish the nine paragraphs of the text.
At
the same
period
the Athenians, instead of following the
old plan of
writing out ordinal numbers in full, adopted the more convenient device
of denoting them by the letters of the alphabet.
In the oldest known
example
opos K indicated
' boundary stone No. 10
'
; and in the fourth
century the tickets of the ten panels of jurymen were marked with the
letters A to K.
In like manner the Books in certain works of Aristotle
(the
Ethics,
Metaphysics,
Politics,
and
Topics)
were
at
some
time

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
(y) Mode of writing numhers in the ordinary
alpliahetic
notation.
Where,
in
the
alphabetical
notation,
the number
to
be
written contained more than
one
denomination,
say,
units
with
tens, or
with
tens and hundreds, the higher numbers
were, as a rule, put before the lower.
This was generally the
case in European Greece
; on the other hand, in the inscrip-
tions of Asia Minor, the smaller number comes
first,
i. e.
the
letters are arranged
in alphabetical order.
Thus 111 may be
represented
either by
P
I A
or by A
I P
;
the
arrangement
is
sometimes mixed, as PA I.
The custom of writing the numbers
in descending order became more firmly established in later
times
through
the
influence
of
the
corresponding Roman
practice.^
The alphabetic numerals sufficed in themselves
to express
all numbers from
1
to
999.
For thousands (up to 9000) the
letters were used again with a distinguishing mark
;
this was
generally
a sloping stroke
to the
left,
e.g. 'A or ^A = 1000,
but
other
forms
are
also
found,
e.g.
the
stroke
might
be
combined with the
letter
as A = 1000 or again 'A= 1000,
"C = 6000.
For tens
of thousands the
letter M
(/xvpLOL) was
borrowed from
the other
system,
e.g.
2 myriads' would
be
p.
BM, MB, or M.
To
distinguish
letters
representing
numbers
from
the
letters
of
the
surrounding
text
different
devices
are used:
sometimes the number
is put between dots
|
or
:
, or separ-
ated by spaces from the text on both sides of
it.
In Imperial
times distinguishing marks, such as a horizontal stroke above
the
letter,
become
common,
e.g.
77
^ovXrj
tS>v
X,
other
variations being
-X-,
-X-, X and the like.
In
the
cursive
writing with which we
are
familiar
the
numbered
on
the
same
principle
;
so
too
the
Alexandrine
scholars
(about 280 b.c.) numbered the twenty-four Books
of Homer with the
letters A
to
O.
When
the number
of
objects exceeded
24,
doubled
letters served
for continuing the
series,
as AA, BB, &c.
For example,
a large quantity of building-stones have been found
; among these are
stones from the theatre at the Piraeus marked AA, BB, &c., and again
AAjBB,
BB|BB,
&o.
when
necessary.
Sometimes
the
numbering
by
double
letters was on
a
different plan, the letter A denoting the
full
number of the first set of letters (24)
; thus AP would be 24

{S)
Gorrbj^arison of the two
systems of numerical notation.
The
relative
merits
of
the
two
systems
of
numerical
notation used by
the Greeks have been
differently judged.
It
will
be
observed
that
the
initial-nnva&vaAs,
correspond
closely
to
the Roman
numerals,
except
that
there
is
no
formation of numbers by subtraction as IX, XL, XC
; thus
XXXXPHHHHPAAAAPIIII = MMMMDCCCCLXXXX VI
II
as
compared
with MMMMCMXCIX = 4999.
The
absolute
inconvenience of the Roman system
will be readily appreci-
ated
by
any
one who
has
tried
to
read Boetius
(Boetius
would write the last-mentioned number as TV. DCCCCXCVIIII).
Yet Cantor ^ draws a comparison between the two systems
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
alphabetic
numerals.
' Instead
', he says,
' of an advance we have here to do with
a decidedly retrogi-ade step, especially so far as its suitability
for
the
further development of the numeral system
is con-
cerned.
If we compare
the older
"Herodianic"
numerals
with the later signs which we have called alphabetic numerals,
we observe in the latter two drawbacks which do not attach
to the former.
There now had to be more signs, with values
to
be
learnt by heart
;
and to reckon with them
required
a much greater effort of memory.
The addition
AAA4- AAAA = PAA
(.30-1-40 = 70)
could be coordinated in one act of memory with that of
HHH-j-HHHH = PHH (300-1-400 = 700)
in so far as the sum of
3 and
4 units of the same kind added
Â»
' Cantor, Gesch. d. Math. P, p. 129.

38
GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
up
to
5 and
2
units of the same kind.
On the other hand
X + /i =
did not at all immediately indicate that t + v = ^.
The new notation
had only one advantage
over the
other,
namely that
it took
less
space.
Consider, for instance, 849,
whicli
in the
" Herodianic " form
is PHHHA A A API
1
1
1, but
in the
alphabetic system
is
a/iO.
The former
is more
self-
explanatory
and,
for reckoning
with,
has
most
important
advantages.'
Gow follows Cantor, but goes further and says
that
' the
alphabetical numerals
were a
fatal mistake and
hopelessly confined such nascent arithmetical faculty as the
Greeks may have possessed
'
! ^
On the other hand. Tannery,
holding that the merits of the alphabetic numerals could only
be tested by using them, practised
himself in
their use until,
applying them to the whole of the calculations in Archimedes's
Measurement of a
Circle, he found that the alphabetic nota-
tion had practical advantages which he had hardly suspected
before, and that the operations took little longer with Greek
than with modern numerals.^
Opposite as these two views are,
they seem to be aUke based on a misconception.
Surely we do
not
' reckon with
'
the numeral
signs
at
all, but with
the
v:ords for the numbers which they represent.
For instance,
in Cantor's illustration, we do not conclude that the figure
3
and i\ie figure 4 added together make the figure 7
; what we
do is to say
' three and four are seven
'.
Similarly the Greek
would not say to himself
' y and 5 = ^
' but TpeTy /cat riaa-apes
inrd.
;
and, notwithstanding what Cantor
says,
this would
indicate
the corresponding addition
' three hundred and four
hundred
are
seven
hundred
',
TpiaKoaioi
Kal
TerpaKoaLoi
(TTTaKoa-toi, and similarly with multiples of ten or of 1000 or
10000.
Again,
in
using
the
multiplication
table, we
say
' three times four
is twelve
', or
' three multiplied by four =
twelve
'
;
the Greek would
say rph
Tecra-ape^,
or
rpeis
enl
ricraapas, SwSeKa, and this would equally indicate that
' thirty
times forty is twelve hundred or one thousand two hundred
',
or that
' thirty times four hundred
is
tiuelve thousand or a
myriad and two thousand

COMPARISON OF THE TWO SYSTEMS
39
The truth
is that in mental
calculation (whether the opera-
tion be
addition, subtraction, multiplication, or
division), we
reckon with the corresponding loords, not with the symbols,
and it does not matter a jot to the calculation how wc choose
to write the figures down.
While therefore the alphabetical
numerals had the advantage over the
' Herodianic
' of
beino;
so concise, their only disadvantage was that there were more
signs (twenty-seven) the meaning of which had
to be com-
mitted
to memorjf
:
truly a very
slight disadvantage.
The
one real drawback to the alphabetic system was the absence
of a sign for
(zero)
; for the
for
ovSe/xLa or ovSev which
we
find in Ptolemy was only used in the notation of sexa-
gesimal fractions, and not as part of the numeral system.
If
there
had been
a
sign
or
signs to
indicate the absence
in
a number of a particular denomination, e.g. units or tens or
.hundreds, the Greek symbols could have been made to serve
as a position-value system
scarcely
less
effective than
ours.
For,
while
the
position-values
are
clear
in such a number
as
7921
(,^^/ca),
it would only be necessary
in the case of
such a number as
7021
to show a blank in the proper place
by writing,
say,
^^- Ka.
Then, following Diophantus's plan
of
separating any number
of
myriads by a
dot from
the
thousands, &c., we could write
^"'h/ca
. ^i^tttS for 79216384 or
^
.
T - S for 70000304, while we could continually add
sets of four figures to the
left, separating each set from the
next following by means of a dot.
(e)
Notation for large numbers.
Here too the orthodox way of writing tens
of thousands
was by means of the letter M with the number of myriads
above
it,
e.g.
M = 20000,
M /cooe = 71755875
(Aristarchus
of Samos)
;
another method was
to write M
or M
for the
myriad and to put the number of myriads after
it, separated
by a dot from the remaining thousands, &c., e. g.
Y
M pv.^f^TrS= 1507984
(Diophantus, IV. 28).
Yet another way of expressing myriads
was to use the symbol representing the number of myriads
with two dots over
it;
thus H^rjcpQ^ = 18592
(Heron,
Geo-
metrica,
17.
33).
The word
/xvpLoiSes
could,
of
course,
be

40

written
in
full,
e.g.
nvpidSes
,l3(ror]
Kal
^(/3 = 22780912
(ib.
17.
34).
To
express
still
higher
numbers, powers
of
myriads were
used;
a myriad
(10000; was & first myriad
(TTpcoTT] fjivpids) to distinguish it from a second myriad (SevTipa
Hvpids)
or
lOOOO'*, and
so on;
the words
Trpmrai
fivpidSes,
Sfvrepai
/ivpLdSes,
&e., could
either
be
written
in
full
or
Y
Y
expressed by M, MM, &e., respectively
; thus Sevrepai jxvpi.dSi's

(Dio
O
phantus,

where
M = jiovaSis
(units)
is
inserted
to
distinguish
the
fi^^v-q,
the number
of
the
' first
myriads
',
from the ^<;-^^ denoting 6560 units.
(i)
Apollonius's
' tetrads
'.
The latter system is the same as that adopted by ApoUonius
in an arithmetical work, now
lost, the character of which is,
however, gathered from the elucidations in Pappus, Book 11;
the only difference
is that ApoUonius called his tetrads
(sets
of four digits) pvpLaSi^ anXoL, SnrXai,
TpLirXal,
&c.,
' simple
mj^riads',
'double',
'triple',
&c.,
meaning
10000,
10000-,
10000^, and
so
on.
The abbreviations
for these
successive
powers in Pappus are
/x",
/i
, ji
, &c.
; thus f/ jev^^ Kal //^yx
Kal
/i"^<7i/ = 5462 3600 6400 0000.
Another, but a
less
con-
venient, method of denoting the successive powers of
10000
is
indicated by
Nicolas Rhabdas
(fourteenth
century
a.d.)
who
says
that,
while
a
pair
of
dots above
the
ordinary
numerals
denoted
the
number
of
myriads,
the
' double
myriad
' was indicated by two pairs of dots one above the other,
the
' triple myriad
' by three pairs of dots, and so on.
Thus
"^ = 9000000,
/Â§ = 2 (10000)2,
^ = 40 (10000)", and so on.

another
special system
invented
for the purpose
of
expressing

is
that

and
all
the numbers

fraction
with

and

The
Greeks
had
a
pre-
ference
for expressing ordinary proper fractions as the sum
of two
or more
submultiples
;
in
this
they
followed
the
Egyptians, who always expressed fractions in this way, with
the exception that they had a single sign for |, whereas we

42
GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
should have expected them to split
it up into i + |, as | was
split up
into A + i-
The orthodox
sign
for
a
submultiple
was
the
letter
for
the
corresponding number (the denomi-
nator)
but
with
an
accent
instead
of
a
horizontal
stroke
above
it; thus
y' = Â§, the
full expression being
y' jxepos =
rpLTOv
fiipo9, a third part
(y'
is
in
fact short
for
rpiros,
so
that
it
is
also used
for the ordinal number
' third
' as well
as
for the fraction
^, and
similarly with
all other accented
numeral
signs);
\fi' = ^^,
pi^' = ttz'
&<=â€¢
There
were
special signs for
|-, namely
U' or CV and for |, namely w'.
When a number of submultiples are
written one
after the
other, the sum
of them
is meant, and
similarly when they
follow a whole number
;
e.g.
l' S' = ^ ^ or | (Archimedes)
;
kO or' ly' X6' = 29| J3 -^^ = 29| + J3 + -^^ or 29if;
fjiO I' iC X8' va'= 49i tV aSf sV = 49^

A
less orthodox method found
in
later
manuscripts was to use two accents and
to
write,
e.g., (" instead of ^', for i.
In Diophantus we find a different
mark in place
of the accent
; Tannery considers the genuine
form of it to be
>i, so that y"^ = i, and so on.

The ordinary Greek form, variously written.
An ordinary proper fraction
(called by Euclid pt-ep-q, farts,
in the plural, as meaning a certain number of aliquot parts,
in contradistinction
to pepo?, ijart, in the singular, which he
restricts to an aliquot part or submultiple) was expressed in
various
ways.
The
first was
to
use the
ordinary
cardinal
number for the numerator followed by the accented number
representing the denominator.
Thus we find in Archimedes
I oa = Yx and
^acoXij
d
la = ISSSjy:
(it should be
noted,
however,
that
the
I
oa
is a
correction from
oia, and
this
oa
seems
to
indicate
that
the
original reading was
i,
which
would
accord
with
Diophantus's
and
Heron's
method
of
writing fractions).
The method illustrated by these cases is
open to objection as likely to lead
to confusion,
since
i oa
^
It
has
been
suggested that the
forms
Q
and

for 1 found
in
inscriptions may perhaps represent half an O, the
sign, at

in Boeotia, for
1 obol.

FRACTIONS
43
one
would naturally mean lO^i and
d
la' 0^\
; the context al
shows
the
true meaning.
Another form akin
to that just
mentioned was
a
little
less
open
to
misconstruction
;
the
numerator was
written
in
full
with
the
accented
numeral
(for
the
denominator)
following,
e.g.
Svo
/xe'
for
2/45ths
(Aristarchus
of
Samos).
A
better
waj^
was
to
turn
the
aliquot
part
into an
abbreviation
for
the
ordinal number
with
a termination
superposed
to represent
the
case,
e.g.
rV =
-?
(Dioph. Lemma
to V.
8),
u
kj"" = |f
(ibid.
I.
23),
pKo"'
^acoXSl.' = 18341/121
{ibid.

just
as
y*"
was
written for the ordinal rpiTos
(cf. to q" , the |th part, Dioph.
IV. 39;
aipco ra ly" 'I remove the
13ths',
i.e.
I multiply up
by
the denominator
13,
ibid. IV.
9).
But
the
trouble was
avoided by each of two other methods.
*
(1) The accented letters representing the denominator were
written
twice,
along
with
the
cardinal
number
for
the
numerator.
This method
is mostly found in the Geometrica
and other works of Heron
:
cf.
e
Ly' ly' â€”
3-%, ra ^ ^'^ = f
.
The
fractional
signification
is
often emphasized by
adding
the word
XeTrrd
('fractions'
or
'fractional
parts'),
e.g.
in
XeTTTo. ly' Ly' i/3 = if (Geom. 12.
5), and, where the expression
contains units as well as fractions, the word
' units
' (/xovdSes)
is generally added, for clearness' sake, to indicate the integral
number,
e.g.
jiovaSe?
t/3

XenTo.
ly' ly'
t/3 = 12i| {Geom.
12.

pfiS XeTTTo. ly' ly' (rqQ = 144\8^3- {Gemn. 12. 6).
Sometimes in Heron fractions are alternatively given in this
notation and jn that of submultiples,

(In
Hultsch's
edition of Heron
single accents were used
to
de-
note whole numbers and the numerators of fractions, while
aliquot parts or

But
(2) the most convenient notation of
all
is that which
is regularly employed by Diophantus, and occasionally in the
Metrica
of
Heron.
In
this system
the numerator
of any
fraction is written in the line, with the denominator above
it.

44
GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
without accents or other marks (except where the numerator
or denominator
itself
contains an
accented
fraction)
;
the
method
is therefore simply the reverse of
ours, but equally
convenient.
In Tannery's
edition
of
Diophantus a
line
is
put between the numerator below and the denominator above
:
-?-
121
thus pKa =

.
But it
is better
to omit the horizontal line
pi^V

(cf.
p

ii, No. cclxv.
40, and the
128

of

;
e. g. Te^ = -â€” (L

Even in the
case of a submultiple, where,
as we have
said, the orthodox
method was
to omit
the numerator
and
sjmply
write
the
denominator with an
accent, Diophantus
often
follows
the
method applicable
to other
fractions,
e.g. he
writes
a
for
TT^ (IV. 28).
Numbers partly integral and partly fractional,
where the fraction
is a submultiple or expressed as the sum
of
submultiples,
are
written much
as we
write them,
the
fractions
simply
following
the

e.g.
a

;

Complicated fractions
in which the numerator and denomi-
nator are algebraical expressions or large numbers are often
expressed by writing the numerator
first and separating
it
by jioptov or kv fiopioi from the denominator;
i.e. the fraction
is expressed as the numerator divided by the denominator
:

as we have
seen) which
was used by the
Greeks
in
astronomical
calculations, and

appears
fully developed
in
the Syntaxis
of
Ptolemy.
The
circumference of a
circle, and with
it the four right angles
subtended by
it at the
centre, were
divided
into 360
parts
{rjirjuaTa
or
fiolpai), as we
should say
degrees,
each
jioipa
into
60
parts
called
(npaiTa)
i^rjKoa-Td,
(first)
sixtieths
or
miniites (XenTd), each of these again into 60 Sivrepa e^r/zcoora,
seconds, and
so
on.
In
like manner,
the diameter
of
the
circle was divided
into
120
TfiTJuara, segments, and each
of
these
segments
was
divided
into
sixtieths,
each
sixtieth
again
into
sixty
parts,
and
so
on.
Thus
a
convenient
fractional system was available for arithmetical calculations
in general
;
for
the unit could be chosen
at
will, and any
mixed number could be expressed as so many of those units
plus
so many
of
the
fractions which we
should
represent
by
-^0,
so many of those which we should write
(-ioY,
(-io)^,
and so on to any extent.
The
units,
T/xrifjiaTa or noipai (the
latter
often denoted by
the abbreviation
/iÂ°), were written
first, with
the
ordinary
numeral
representing
the number
of them
; then came a simple numeral with one accent repre-
senting
that number
of first
sixtieths,
or minutes,
then
a
numeral
with
two
accents
representing
that
number
of
second
sixtieths,
or
seconds, and
so
on.
Thus
/[iÂ°
/3 = 2Â°,
lioipSav
n(
/i/3'
n'' = 47Â° 42' 40".
Similarly,
tfirjfidrmv
^(
S'
j/e" = 67P i' 55",
where p denotes
the segment
(of
the
diameter).
Where
there
was no
unit,
or
no
number
of
sixtieths,
second
sixtieths,
&c.,
the
symbol
O,
signifying
ovSep-ia
fioTpa,
oiiSff
l^rjKocrTov, and the
like, was used;
thus
IxoLpoov O a
/3" O'" â€” 0Â°!' 2" 0"'.
The system
is parallel to
our system of decimal fractions, with the
difference that the
submultiple is ^- instead of ^
; nor
is
it much
less easy to
work with, while
it furnishes a very speedy way of approxi-
mating to the values of quantities not expressible in whole
numbers.
For example, in his Table of Chords, Ptolemy says
that the chord subtending an angle of
120Â° at the centre
is
(TfirifidTO)!^} py
ve' Ky"
or
103''
55' 23";
this
is equivalent
(since the radius of the
circle
is 60 T/j-rJuara) to saying that
73 =
1
-I- ^ +
^^., + ^^v, and this works out to 1-7320509...,

is
correct
to the seventh decimal
place, and exceeds
the true value by 0-00000003 only.

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
Practical
calculation.
(a)
The abacus.
In practical calculation it was open to the Greeks to secure
the
advantages
of
a
position-value
system
by
using
the
abacus.
The essence of the abacus was the arrangement of
it in columns which might be vertical or horizontal, but were
generally
vertical,
and
pretty
certainly
so
in
Greece and
Egypt; the
columns were marked
off by
lines
or in some
other way and allocated to the
successive denominations of
the numerical system
in
use,
i.e., in the case of the decimal
system, the units, tens, hundreds, thousands, mj^riads, and so
on.
The number of units of each denomination was shown in
each column by means of pebbles,
pegs, or the like.
When,
in
the process of
addition or multiplication, the number of
pebbles
collected
in one column becomes
sufficient
to make
one or more units of the next higher denomination, the num-
ber of pebbles representing the complete number of the higher
units
is withdrawn from
the column
in
question
and
the
proper number of the higher units added to the next higher
column.
Similarly, in subtraction, when a number of units of
one denomination has
to
be
subtracted and
there
are
not
enough pebbles in the particular column to subtract from, one
pebble from the next higher column is withdrawn and actually
or mentally
resolved
into
the number
of
the
lower
units
equivalent in value
; the latter number of additional pebbles
increases the number already in the column to a number from
which the number to be subtracted can actually be withdrawn.
The details of the columns of the Greek abacus have unfor-
tunately to be inferred from the corresponding details of the
Roman abacus, for the only abaci which have been preserved
and
can with certainty be
identified
as
such
are
Roman.
There were
two
kinds;
in one
of
these
the marks
were
buttons or knobs which could be moved up and down in each
column, but could not be taken out of
it, while in the other
kind they were pebbles which could
also be moved from one
column
to another.
Each column was in two parts, a shorter
portion
at
the top containing one
button
only, which
itself
represented
half the number of units necessary to make up
one of
the
next
higher
units, and
a longer portion
below

PRACTICAL CALCULATION
47
containing one less than half -the same number.
This arrange-
ment of the columns in two parts enabled the total number of
buttons to be economized.
The columns represented, so far as
integral numbers were concerned, units, tens, hundreds, thou-
sands,
&c., and
in
these
cases
the one
button
in
the
top
portion of each column represented five units, and there were
four buttons
in
the
lower
portion
representing
four
units.
But
after the columns
representing
integers came columns
representing fractions
; the
first contained buttons i-epresent-
ing unciae, of which there were 12 to the
unit, i.e. fractions
of ]^th, and
in
this
case the one button in the top portion
represented 6 unciae or i^ths, while there were 5 buttons
in
the lower portion
(instead of
4), the buttons
in the column
thus representing in all
1 1 unciae or 1 2ths.
After this column
there were
(in one specimen) three other shorter ones along-
side the lower poi-tions only of the columns for integers, the
first representing fractions of ^^th
(one
button), the second
fractions of -^--g^h (one button), and the third fractions of -f^^d
(two buttons, which of course together made up ^^gth).
The mediaeval writer of the so-called geometry of Boetius
desbribes another method of indicating in the various columns
the number of units of each denomination.^
According to him
' abacus
' was a
later name
for what was previously
called
mensa Pythagorea, in honour of the Master who had taught
its use.
The method was to put in the columns, not the neces-
sary number
of
pebbles or
buttons, but
the corresponding
numeral, which might be written
in sand spread
over the
surface (in the same way as Greek geometers are said to have
drawn geometrical figures in sand strewn on boards similarly
called a^a^ or afidKLov).
The figures put in the columns were
called apices.
The first variety of numerals mentioned by the
writer are rough forms of the Indian figures
(a fact which
proves the late date of the composition)
; but other forms were
(1) the first letters of the alphabet (which presumably mean
the Greek alphabetic numerals) or
(2)
the ordinary Roman
figures.
We should expect the arrangement of the Greek abacus to
correspond to the Roman, but the actual evidence regarding its
form and the extent to which
it was used
is so scanty that.

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATiUiN
we may well doubt whether any great use was made of
it at
all.
But
the
use
of pebbles
to reckon with
is
attested by
several writers.
In Aristophanes (Wasps, 656-64) Bdelycleon
tells his father to do an easy sum
' not with pebbles but with
fingers \ as much as to say,
' There is no need to use pebbles
for this sum
; you can do
it on your fingers.'
' The income
of the
state', he
says,
'is 2000 talents; the yearly payment
to the 6000 dicasts is only 150 talents.'
' Why
', answers the
old man,
' we don't
sret a tenth of the revenue.'
The calcula-
tion in this case amounted
to multiplying 150 by 10 to show
that the product
is less than 2000.
But more to the purpose
are the following allusions.
Herodotus says that, in reckoning
with pebbles, as in writing, the Greeks move their hand from
left to right, the Egyptians from right to left ^
;
this indicates
that the columns were vertical, facing the reckoner.
Diogenes
Laertius attributes to Solon a statement that those who had
influence with tyrants were like the pebbles on a reckoning-
board, because they sometimes stood for more and sometimes
for less.^
A character in a fourth-century comedy asks for an
abacus and pebbles to do his accounts.'
But most definite of
all
is a remark of Polybius that
' These men are really like
the pebbles
on reckoning-boards.
For the
latter,
according
to the
pleasure
of
the reckoner, have
the
value, now
of
a
XaX/coOy (|th
of an obol or ^gth of a drachma), and the next
moment of a talent.' *
The passages of Diogenes Laertius and
Polybius both indicate that the pebbles were not fixed in the
columns, but could be transferred from one
to another, and
the
latter
passage has some
significance
in
relation
to
the
Salaminian table presently to be mentioned, because the talent
and the
x"-^'^"^^
^i"Â® actually the extreme denominations on
one side of the table.
Two
relics
other than
the
Salaminian
table may throw
some
light on
the
subject.
First,
the
so-called Darius-vase
found at Canosa (Canusium), south-west of Barletta, represents
a collector of tribute of distressful countenance with a table in
front of him having pebbles, or (as some maintain) coins, upon
it and, on the right-hand edge, beginning on the side farthest
away and written
in
the
direction towards him, the

Now
M, 1'
(= X), H, and > are of course the
initial letters of the words
for 10000, 1000, 100, and 10 respectively.
* Here therefore we
have a purely decimal system, without the halfway numbers
represented by P (= irevn, 5) in combination with the other
initial letters which we find in the
Attic
' sj^stem.
The sign
P after
> seems to be wrongly written for
P, the older sign
for a drachma, O stands for the obol, < for the f-obol, and T
(TerapTrjiiopLou) for the ^r-oboL^
Except that the fractions of
the unit (here the drachma) are
different from the fractions
of the Roman
unit,
this scheme corresponds
to the Roman,
and so far might represent the abacus.
Indeed, the decimal
arrangement corresponds better to the abacus than does the
Salaminian table with its intermediate
' Herodianic
' signs for
500,
50, and 5 drachmas.
Prof. David Eugene Smith is, how-
ever, clear that any one can see from a critical examination of
the
piece
that what
is
represented
is an
ordinary money-
changer
or
tax-receiver with
coins on a
table such as one
might see anywhere' in the East to-day, and that the table has
no resemblance to an abacus.^
On the other hand, it is to be
observed that the open book held by the tax-receiver in his
left hand has TAAN on one page and TA'iH
on
the
other,
which would seem to indicate that he was entering
totals in
talents and must therefore presumably have been adding coins
or pebbles on the table before him.
There
is a
second
existing monument
of
the same
sort,
namely
a
so-called
a^Kcofia
(or
arrangement
of
measures)
discovered about forty years ago *
;
it
is a stone tablet with
fluid measures and has, on the right-hand side, the numerals
XPHPAPhTIC.
The signs are the 'Herodianic', and they
include* those
for
500, 50, and
5 drachmas
; h
is the sign for
a drachma, T
evidently
stands
for
some number
of
obols
making a fraction
of
the
drachma,
i.e.
the rpLw^oXov or

The table, now broken into two unequal parts,
is

The
facts with
regard to it are stated, and a photograph of it is satisfactorily
produced, by Wilhelm Kubitschek.^
A representation of it is
also given by Nagl ^ based on Rangabd's description, and the
sketch of it here appended follows Nagl's drawing.
The size
and material of the
table (according
to Rangabd's measure-
ments
it
is 1-5
metres long and 0-75 metre broad) show that
it was no ordinary abacus
;
it may
have been
a
fixture
intended
for
quasi-public use, such as a banker's
or money-changer's table, or again
it may have been a scoring-table
for some kind
of game like
tric-
trac or backgammon.
Opinion has
from the first been divided between
the two views
;
it has even been
suggested
that
the
table was
in-
tended for both purposes. But there
can be no doubt that
it was used
for some kind
of calculation and,
if it was not actually an abacus, it
may at least serve to give an idea
of what the abacus was like.

to
he
agreed that the four spaces provided between the five shorter
lines were intended for the fractions of the drachma
; the first
space would
require
5
pebbles
(one
less
than
the
6
obols
making
up
a
drachma),
the
others one
each.
The
longer
XP'HPAri-ICTX

PRACTICAL CALCULATION
51
lines would provide the spaces for the drachmae and higher
denominations.
On the assumption that the cross
line indi-
cates the Roman method of having one pebble above
it
to
represent
5, and four below it representing units,
it
is
clear
that, including denominations up to the talent (6000 drachmae),
only five columns are necessary, namely one for the talent or
6000 drachmae, and four for
1000, 100, 10 drachmae, and
1
drachma respectively.
But there are actually ten spaces pro-
vided by the eleven lines.
On the theory of the game-board,
five
of
the
ten on one
side
(right
or
left)
are supposed
to
belong to each of two players placed facing each other on the
two longer sides of the table
(but, if in playing they had
to
use the shorter columns for the
fractions,
it
is not clear how
they would make them sulRce)
; the ci'oss on the middle of the
middle line might in that case serve to mark the separation
between the lines belonging to the two players, or perhaps all
the crosses may have the one object of helping the eye to dis-
tinguish
all the columns from one another.
On the assump-
tion that the table is an abacus, a possible explanation of the
eleven lines is to suppose that they really supply _^w columns
only, the odd lines marking the divisions between the columns,
and
the
even
lines,
one
in
the
middle
of
each
column,
marking where the pebbles should be placed in rows
;
in this
case, if the crosses are intended to mark divisions between the
four pebbles representing units and the,one pebble represent-
ing 5 in each column, the crosses are only required in the last
three columns
(for
100,
10, and
1), because, the highest de-
nomination
being
6000
drachmae,
there was no need for a
division of the
1000-column, which only required
five
unit-
pebbles altogether.
Nagl, a thorough-going supporter of the
abacus-theory to the exclusion of the other, goes further and
shows how the Salaminian table could have been used for the
special purpose of carrying out a long multiplication
; but this
development seems
far-fetched, and
there
is no evidence
of
such a use.
The Greeks in fact had little need of the abacus
for calcu-
lations.
With their alphabetic numerals they couldjwork out
their
additions,
subtractions,
multiplications, and
divisions
without the help of any marked columns, in a form little'Jess
convenient than ours
: examples of long multiplications, which

include addition as the last step in each
case,

on
Archimedes's

Circle.
We
will
take
the
four
arithmetical
operations
separately.
(/3)
Addition and Subtraction.
There is no doubt that, in writing down numbers
for the
purpose of these operations, the Greeks would keep the several
powers of 10 separate in a manner practically corresponding
to our system of numerals, the hundreds, thousands, &c., being
written
in
separate
vertical rows.
The following would be
a typical example of a sum in addition

and the mental part of the work would be the same for the
Greek as for us.

(i)
The Egyptian method.
For carrying out multiplications two things were required.
The
first was
a multiplication
table.
This
the
Greeks
are
certain to have had from very early times.
The Egyptians,
indeed, seem never to have had such a table.
We know from
the Papyrus Rhind that in order to multiply by any number
the Egyptians began by successive
doubling, thus
obtaining
twice, four times, eight times, sixteen times the multiplicand,
and so on
; they then added such sums of this series of multi-
ples (including once the multiplicand) as were required.
Thus,

MULTIPLICATION
53
to multiply by
13, they did not take
10 times and
3 times
the multiplicand respectively and add them, but they i'ound
1 3 times the multiplicand by adding once and 4 times and 8
times
it, which elements they had obtained by the
doubling-
process;
similarly they would find
25
times any number by
adding once and 8 times and
1 6 times the number.^
Division
was performed by the Egyptians in an even more rudimen-
tary fashion, namely by a tentative back-multiplication begin-
ning with the same doubling process.
But, as we have seen
(p.
14), the scholiast to the Gharmides says that the bra'hches
of
XoyLo-TLKrj
include
the
' so-called
Greek
and
Egyptian
methods in multiplications and
divisions'.
(ii)
The Greek method.
The Egyptian method being what we have just described, it
seems
clear
that
the
Greek
method,
which
was
different,
depended on the direct use of a multiplication table.
A frag-
ment of such a multiplication table
is preserved on a two-
leaved wax tablet in the British Museum (Add. MS. 34186).
'
I have been told that there
is a method in use to-day (some say in
Russia, but I have not been able to verify this), which is certainly attractive
and looks original, but which will immediately be seen to amount siinply
to an elegant practical method of cari-ying out the Egyptian procedure.
Write out side by
side in successive
lines, so as to form two columns,
(1)
the
multiplier and
multiplicand,
(2)
half
the
multiplier
(or
the
nearest integer below
it
if the multiplier
is odd) and twice the multi-
plicand,
(3) half (or the nearest integer below the half) of the number
in the
first column
of the preceding row and twice the number in the
second column
of the preceding row, and
so
on,
until we have
1
in
the
first column.
Then
strike out
all numbers in the second column
which are opposite even numbers in the
first column, and add
all the
numbers
left
in
the second
column.
The sum
will be
the
required
product.
Suppose
e.g. that 157
is to be multiplied by
88.
The rowa
and columns then are
:
83
157
41
314
20
-628-
10
Â«6e-
5
2512
2
5024
1
10048
13031 = 83x157
The explanation
is,
of course, that, where we take half the preceding
number in the first column less one, v^e omit once the figure in the right-
hand column, so that
it must be
left in that column
to be added in at
the end;
and where we take the exact half of an even number, we
omit nothing in the right-hand column, hut the new line
is the exact
equivalent of the preceding one, which can therefore be struck out.

54
GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
It
is believed
to date from the second century
A. D., and
it
probably came from Alexandria or the
vicinity.
But
the
form of the characters and the mingling of capitals and small
letters both allow
of an
earlier
date;
e.g. there
is
in
the
Museum a Greek papyrus assigned to the third century
B.C.
in which the numerals are very similar to those on the tablet.^
The second requirement is connected with the fact that the
Greeks began their multiplications by taking the product of
the highest constituents first, i.e. they proceeded as we should
if we
wei-e
to begin our long
multiplications from
the
left
instead
of the
right.
The only difficulty would be to
settle
the denomination of the products of two high powers of
ten.
With such numbers as
the Greeks usually had
to multiply
there would be no trouble
; but
if, say, the factors were un-
usually large numbers, e.g. millions multiplied by millions or
billions,
care would
be
required,
and
even
some
rule
for
settling
the
denomination,
or
determining
the
particular
power
or powers
of
10
which
the
product would
contain.
This exceptional necessity was dealt with in the two special
treatises, by Archimedes and Apollonius respectively, already
mentioned.
The
former, the Sand-reckoner, proves
that,
if
there be a
series of numbers,
1,
10, 10^
10^..
10â„¢...
10"...,
then, if
10'", 10" be any two terms of the series, their product
10'"
. 10" will be a term in the same series and will be as many
terms distant from
10** as the term
10'"
is
distant from
1;
also
it will be
distant from
1 by a number of terms
less by
one than the sum of the numbers of terms by which
1 0"* and
1 0" respectively are distant from
1
.
This
is easily seen to be
equivalent
to the
fact
that,
10'"
being
the
(m+l)th
term
beginning
with
1,
and
10"
the
(9i+l)th
term
beginning
with
1, the
product
of
the two terms
is
the (m + ')i+l)th
term beginning with
1, and
is
10'"+".
(iii)
Apollonius's continued
multiplications.
The system of Apollonius deserves a short description.^
Its
object
is
to give a handy method
of finding the
continued
product of any number of factors, each of which is represented
by a single letter in the Greek numeral notation.
It does not
^ David Eugene Smith in Bihliotheca Mathematica, ixj, pp. 193-5.
"^ Our authority here is the Synagoge of Pappus, Book ii, pp. 2-28, Hultsch,

MULTIPLICATION
55
therefore show how
to multiply two
large numbers each of
which contains a number of
digits
(in our notation), that
is,
a certain number of units, a certain number of tens, a certain
number of hundreds, &e.
;
it
is confined to the multiplication
of any number of factors each of which is one or other of the
following
:
(a) a number of units as
1, 2,
3,
... 9,
(b) a number
of even tens as 10, 20, 30, ... 90, (c) a number of even hundreds
as 100, 200, 300,
... 900.
It does not deal with factors above
hundreds,
e.g.
1000
or
4000;
this
is
because
the
Greek
numeral alphabet only went up
to 900, the notation begin-
ning again after that with ^a,
,13, ... for 1000, 2000, &c.
The
essence of the method
is the separate multiplication (1) of the
bases, TrvOjxeves, of the several factors, (2) of the powers of ten
contained in the
factors, that
is, what we represent by
the
ciphers in each factor.
Given a multiple of ten, say 30, 3
is
the
TTvOfMriv or base, being the same number of units as the
number contains tens
;
similarly in a multiple of 100, say 800,
8
is the base.
In multiplying three numbers such as 2, 30,
800, therefore, Apollonius first multiplies the bases,
2,
3, and 8,
then finds separate^ the product of the ten and the hundred,
and lastly multiplies the two products.
The final product has
to be
expressed
as a
certain? number
of units
less
than a
myriad, then a certain number of myriads, a certain number
of
'double
myriads'
(myriads
squared),
'triple
myriads'
(myriads cubed), &c., in other words in the form
where Jf is a myriad or 10* and A^, A-^... respectively repre-
sent some number not exceeding 9999.
No special directions are given for carrying out the multi-
plication ;of
the
bases
(digits),
or
for the
multiplication
of
their product
into
the
product
of
the
tens,
hundreds,
&c.,
when separately found
(directions
for the
latter multiplica-
tion may have been contained in propositions missing from
the mutilated fragment in Pappus).
But the method of deal-
ing with the tens and hundreds (the ciphers in our notation)
is made
the
subject
of a
considerable number
of
separate
propositions.
Thus in two propositions the factors are
all of
one sort (tens or hundreds), in another we have factors of two
sorts
(a number of factors containing
units only multiplied

56
GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
by a number of multiples
of
ten, each
less than 100, or by
multiples of 100, each less than 1000), and so on.
In the final
proposition
(25), with which the introductory lemmas
close,
the factors are of
all three kinds, some containing units only,
others being multiples of 10
(less than 100) and a third
set
being multiples
of
100
(less than
1000
in each
case).
As
Pappus
frequently
says,
the
proof
is
easy
'in
numbers';
Apollonius himself seems to have proved the propositions by
means of lines or a diagram in some form.
The method is the
equivalent of taking the indices of all the separate powers of
ten included in the factors (in which process ten =10' counts
as
1; and 100 = 10^ as
2), adding the indices together, and then
dividing the sum by
4
to obtain the power of the myriad
(10000) which the product contains.
If the whole number in
the
quotient
is
n,
the
product
contains
(10000)"
or
the
M-myriad in Apollonius's
notation.
There will in most cases
be a remainder left after division by 4, namely
3,
2, or
1
: the
remainder then represents
(in our notation)
3,
2, or
1 more
ciphers, that
is, the product
is
1000,
100, or
10
times
the
w-myriad, or the 10000", as the ease may be.
We cannot do better than
illustrate by the main problem
which
Apollonius
sets
himself, namely that
of
multiplying
together all the numbers represented by the separate
letters
in the hexameter
'ApTe/jLLSos
KXeiTf Kparos
'i^oy(ov kvvea
Kovpai.
The number of letters, and therefore of factors, is 38, of which
10 are multiples of 100 less than 1000, namely p, t,
cr,
r, p, t,
(T, X, y, P (=100, 300, 200, 300,
100, 300, 200, 600, 400,
100),
1 7 are multiples of 10 less than 100, namely fi,
l, o, k, A,
i, k, o, ^,
0, o, V,
V, V, K,
o,
L
( = 40, 10, 70, 20, 30, 10, 20, 70, 60, 70, 70,
50,
50, 50, 20, 70, 10), and 11 are numbers of units not exceeding
9, namely a, e, S, e, e, a, e, e, e, a, a( = l, 5, 4, 5, 5,
1, 5, 5, 5,
1,
1).
The sum
of the
indices of powers of
ten contained
in
the
factors is therefore 10.2 + 17.1=37.
This, when divided by
4, gives 9 with
1 as remainder.
Hence the product of
all the
tens and hundreds, excluding the bases in each, is 10
. 10000Â°.
We have now, as the second part of the operation, to mul-
tiply the numbers containing units only by the basea of all the
other factors, i.e. (beginning with the
bases, first of the hun-
dreds, then of the tens) to multiply together the numbers

(iv)
Examples of ordinary multiplications.
I shall now illustrate, by examples taken from Eutocius, the
Greek method of performing long multipHcations.
It will be
seen
that,
as
in
the
case
of
addition and
subtraction,
the
working is essentially the same as ours.
The multiplicand
is
written first, and below it is placed the multipher preceded by
eTTL (=
' by
' or
' into ').
Then the term containing the highest
power of 10 in the multiplier is taken and multiplied into all
the terms in the multiplicand, one after the other, first into that
containing the highest power of 10, then into that containing
the nest highest power of
1 0, and so on in descending order
;
after which the term containing the next highest power of 10
in the multiplier is multiplied into all the terms of the multi-
plicand in the same order
; and
so on.
The same procedure
is followed where either or both of the numbers to be multi-
plied
contain
fractions.
Two examples from Eutocius
will
make the whole operation cleai'.

The multiplication of 37Â° 4' 55" (in the sexagesimal system)
by itself
is performed by Theon
of Alexandria
in
his com-
mentary on Ptolemy's Syntaxis in an exactly similar manner.
(S)
Division.
The operation of division depends on those of multiplication
and subtraction, and was performed by the Greeks, 'mutatis
mutandis, in the same way as we perform it to-day.
Suppose,
for example, that the process in the first of the above multi-
plications had to be reversed and M^eo-a (1825201) had to be
divided by ^arva (1351).
The terms involving the successive
powers of 10 would be mentally kept
separate, as in addition
and
subtraction, and the
fu-st question would
be, how many
times does one thousand go into one million, allowing for the
fact that the one thousand has 351 behind
it, while the one
million
has
825
thousands behind
it.
The
answer
is
one
thousand or ,a, and this multiplied by the divisor ^arva gives
M^a
which,
subtracted
from
M^ecra,
leaves
M/cra.
This

DIVISION
59
remainder
(= 474201) has now to be divided by ^arva (1351),
and it would be seen that the latter would go into the i'oimer
T (300) times, but not u (400) times.
Multiplying ^arva by r,
we obtain
M^er (405300), which, when subtracted from M/o-a
(474201), leaves M^rj'^a (68901).
This has again to be divided
by ^aTfa and goes
u (50) times
;
multiplying ^arfa by
f, we
have M/^j/
(67550), which, subtracted from
M^r]~^a (68901),
leaves ^arva (1351).
The last quotient
is therefore a
(1), and
the whole quotient is ^arfa (1351).
An actual case of long division where both dividend and
divisor contain sexagesimal
fractions
is described by Theon.
The problem
is
to
divi<le
1515
20' 15" by
25

Theon's account of the process amounts to the following
:

GREEK NUMERICAL NOTATION
pjr/3
Theon's and that of dividing M^eaa hy
arva as above is tliat
Theon makes three subtractions for one term of the quotient,
whereas the remainder was arrived at in the other case after
one subtraction.
The result
is
that, though Theon's method
is quite clear, it is longer, and moreover makes it less easy to
foresee what will be the proper figure to try in the quotient,
so
that more
time would
probably be
lost
in making
un-
successful trials.
(e)
Extraction of the square
root.
We are now in a position to see how the problem of extract-
ing the square root of a number would be attacked.
First, as
in
the
case
of
division,
the
given whole number would
be
separated
into terms containing
respectively such and such
a number of units and of the
separate powers of
10.
Thus
there would be
so many units, so many
tens, so many hun-
dreds, &c., and
it would have to be borne
in mind that the
squares
of numbers from
1
to
9
lie between
1 and
99, the
squares of numbers from 10 to 90 between 100 and 9900, and
so on.
Then the first term of the square root would be some
number of
tens
or hundreds or thousands,
and
so
on, and
would have
to be found in much the same way as the
first
term
of a quotient in a long
division, by ti'ial
if
necessary.
If A is the number the square root of which is required, while
a represents the first term or denomination of the square root,
and X the next term or denomination to be found, it would be
necessary
to use the
identity
(a-fx)^ = a^-t- 2aa; + a;^ and to
find X
so
that
2ax + x^ might
be somewhat
less
than
the
remainder A â€” a^, i.e. we have to divide A â€” a" by
2t/, allowing
for the fact that not only must 2 ax (where x is the quotient)
but
also
{2a + x)x be
less than A â€”a--
Thus, by
trial,
the
highest possible value of x satisfying the condition would be
easily
found.
If
that
value
were^&,
the further quantity
2 ah +
b'-^ would have to be subtracted from the first remainder
A â€” a^, and from the second remainder thus left a third term
or denomination of the square root would have to be found in
like manner
; and so on.
That this was the actual procedure
followed is clear from a simple ease given by Theon of Alex-
andria in his commentary on the Syntaxis.
Here the square
root
of
144
is in
question, and
it
is obtained by means

denomination
(i.e. power
of 10) in the square root is 10
; 10- subtracted from 144 leaves
44, and
this must contain, not only twice the product of 10
and the next term of the square
root, but also the square of
the next term itself.
Now twice 1.10 itself produces 20, and
the division of 44 by 20 suggests
2
as the next term of the
square root
; this turns out to be the exact figure required, since
2.20 + 2^ = 44.
The same procedure
is
illustrated by Theon's explanation
of Ptolemy's method of extracting square roots according to
the sexagesimal system of
fractions.
The problem
is to find
approximately the square root of 4500
fioipai or degrees, and

EXTRACTION OF THE SQUARE ROOT
63
If we
first found the unit
1 and then
tried
to find the next
term by trial, it would probably involve a troublesome amount
of
trials.
An
alternative
method
in
such
a
case was
to
multiply the number by
60^, thus
reducing
it
to
second-
sixtieths, and
then, taking the square root, to ascertain the
number of
first-sixtieths in
it.
Now 3.60'''= 10800, and, as
103^= 10609, the
first
element
in
the
square
root
of
3
is
found in this way to be --- (=
1 +^).
That this was the
method in such cases is indicated by the fact that, in the Table
of Chords, each chord
is expressed
as a
certain number of
first-sixtieths, followed by the second-sixtieths, &c., Vs being
,
103

â€ž,
^,
.
..,.,,,
expressed as -â€”-
-f- â€”
-^ -|- â€”-
.
The same thing
is indicated by
the scholiast to EucL, Book X, who begins the operation of
finding
the
square
root
of
31
10' 36"
by reducing
this
to
second-sixtieths;
the number of
second-sixtieths
is
112236,
which
gives,
as the number of
first-sixtieths in the
square
335
root,
335,
while
= 5
35'.
The
second-sixtieths
in
the
square root can then be found in the same way as in Theon's
example.
Or^ as the scholiast says, we can obtain the square
root as far as the second-sixtieths by reducing the original
number to fourth-sixtieths, and so on.
This would no doubt
be the way in which the approximate value 2 49' 42" 20"' 10""
given by the
scholiast
for
-/s was obtained, and
similarly
with other approximations of his, such as
-/2 = 1
24' 51" and
7(27) = 5
11' 46" 50'" (the 50'" should be
10'").
(()
Extraction of the cube root
Our method of extracting the cube root of a number depends
upon the formula
(a + xf = a" + 3 a'^x + 3 ax"^ + x\ just as the
extraction
of
the
square
root
depends
on
the
formula
(a+x)"^ = a^ + 2ax + x^-
As we have seen, the Greek method
of extracting the square root was to use the latter (Euclidean)
formula just as we do
; but in no extant Greek writer do we
find any description of the operation of extracting the cube
root.
It
is possible that the Greeks had not much occasion
for
extracting
cube
roots,
or
that a
table
of cubes would
suffice for most of their purposes.
But that they had some

method is clear from a passage of Heron, where he gives 4
as an approximation to ^(100), and shows liow he obtains
it.'
Heron merely gives
the working dogmatically,
in
concrete
numbers,
without
explaining
its
theoretical
basis, and we
cannot be quite certain as to the
precise formula underlying
the operation.
The best suggestion which has been made on
the
subject
will
be given

its

place,

Ill
PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
There
is very little early evidence regarding Pythagoras's
own achievements, and what there is does not touch his mathe-
matics.
The
earliest philosophers and historians who refer
to
him would
not be
interested in
this part
of
his work.
Heraclitus speaks of his wide knowledge, but with disparage-
ment
:
' much learning
does
not
teach
wisdom
;
otherwise
it
would have
taught
Hesiod and
Pythagoras,
and
again
Xenophanes and Hecataeus '}
Herodotus alludes to Pytha-
goras and the Pythagoreans several times
; he calls Pythagoras
' the most able philosopher among the Greeks
' {'EWiji/cov ov
TW dcrdevea-TdT(p
a-ocfiLa-Trj IIv6ay6pr]).'^
In Empedocles he had
an enthusiastic admirer
:
' But there was among them a man
of prodigious knowledge who acquired the profoundest wealth
of understanding and was the greatest master of skilled arts
of every kind
;
for, whenever he willed with his whole heart,
he could with ease discern each and every truth in his ten
nay, twentyâ€”men's lives.'
Pythagoras
himself
left
no
written
exposition
of
his
doctrines, nor did any of his immediate
successors, not even
Hippasus,
about whom the
different
stories ran
(1) that he
was expelled from the school because he published doctrines
of
Pythagoras,
and
(2)
that
he
was
drowned
at
sea
for
revealing the construction of the dodecahedron in the sphere
and claiming it as his own, or (as others have it)
for making
known the discovery of the
irrational
or incommensurable.
Nor
is the
absence
of any written
record of Pythagorean

doctrines down
to
the
time
of
Philolaus
to
be
attributed
to a pledge
of secrecy binding the school
;
at
all
events,
it
did
not
apply
to
their
mathematics
or
their physics
;
the
supposed
secrecy may even have been invented
to explain
the absence of documents.
The fact appears to be that oral
communication was the
tradition
of the
school, while
their
doctrine would in the main be too abstruse to be understood
by the generality of people outside.
In
these
circumstances
it
is
difficult
to
disentangle
the
portions
of
the
Pythagorean
philosophy
which can safely
be
attributed
to the founder
of
the
school.
Aristotle
evi-
dently
felt this
difficulty
;
it
is clear that he knew nothing
for
certain of any
ethical
or physical doctrines going back
to Pythagoras himself
; and when he speaks
of
the Pytha-
gorean
sjrstein,
he always
refers
it
to
' the Pythagoreans
',
sometimes even to
' the so-called Pythagoreans'.
The earliest direct testimony to the eminence of Pythagoras
in mathematical studies seems to be that of Aristotle, who in
his separate book On the Pythagoreans, now lost, wrote that
' Pythagoras, the son of Mnesarchus, first worked at mathe-
matics and arithmetic, and afterwards, at one time, condescended
to the wonder-working practised by Pherecydes.'
In
the
Metaphysics
he
speaks
in
similar
terms
of
the
Pythagoreans
' In
the
time
of
these
philosophers
(Leucippus
and
Democritus)
and
before
them
the
so-called
Pythagoreans
applied
themselves
to the
study
of mathematics, and were
the first to advance that science
; insomuch that, having been
brought up
in
it, they thought that
its principles must be
the principles of all existing things.' ^
It
is
certain
that the Theory
of Numbers
originated
in
the
school
of Pythagoras;
and, with regard
to Pythagoras
himself, we
are
told by Aristoxenus that he
' seems to have
attached
supreme
importance
to
the
study
of
arithmetic,
which he advanced and took out of the region of commercial
utility '.3

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
67
Numbers and the universe.
We know thatThales (about 624-547 B.C.) and Anaximander
(born
probably
in
611/10
B.C.)
occupied
themselves
with
astronomical
phenomena,
and,
even
before
their
time,
the
principal
constellations had been
distinguished.
Pythagoras
(about 572-497
B.C.
or a
little
later)
seems
to have
been
the
first Greek
to discover that
the planets
have
an
inde-
pendent movement, of
their own from west
to
east,
i.e.
in
a direction contrary to the daily rotation of the fixed stars
;
or he may have learnt what he knew of the planets from the
Babylonians.
Now any one who was in the habit of intently
studying
the
heavens
would
naturally
observe
that
each
constellation has two characteristics, the number of the stars
which compose
it
and
the
geometrical
figure
which
they
form.
-Here, as a recent writer has remarked,^ we find, if not
the origin, a striking illustration of the Pythagorean doctrine.
And, just as the constellations have a number characteristic
of them
respectively, so
all known
objects have a number
;
as
the
formula
of
Philolaus
states,
'all
things which can
be known have number;
for
it
is not possible that without
number anything can either be conceived or known '?
This formula, however, does not yet express all the content
of the Pythagorean doctrine.
Not only do
all things possess
numbers
;
but,
in
addition,
all things
are numbers
;
' these
thinkers ', says
Aristotle,
' seem
to consider that number
is
the
principle both as matter for things and as constituting
their
attributes
and
permanent
states'.^
True,
Aristotle
seems to regard the theory as originally based on the analogy
between the properties of things and of numbers.
' They thought they found
in numbers, more than in fire,
earth, or water, many resemblances
to things which are and
become
; thus such and such an attribute of numbers
is jus-
tice, another is soul and mind, another
is opportunity, and so
on
; and again they saw in numbers the attributes and ratios
of the musical
scales.
Since,
then,
all other things seemed
in
their whole
nature
to
be assimilated
to numbers, while
numbers seemed to be the first things in the whole of nature,

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
they supposed the elements
of numbers
to
be the elements
of all things, and the whole heaven to be a musical scale and
a number.' ^
This
passage,
with
its
assertion
of
' resemblances
'
and
' assimilation
', suggests numbers as affections, states, or rela-
tions rather than
as substances, and the same
is implied b}'
the
remark
that
existing
things
exist
by
virtue
of
their
imitation
of
numbers.^
But
again we
are
told
that
the
numbers are not separable from the things, but that existing
things, even perceptible substances, are made up of numbers
;
that the substance
of
all things
is number,
that things are
numbers, tliat numbers are made up from the unit, and that the
whole heaven is numbers.^
Still more definite is the statement
that the
Pythagoreans
' construct the whole heaven out of
numbers, but not of monadic numbers, since they suppose the
units to have magnitude
', and that,
' as we have said before,
the
P^'thagoi'eans assume the numbers
to have
magnitude'.''
Aristotle points out certain obvious difficulties.
On the one
hand the Pythagoreans speak of
'this number of which the
heaven is composed
'
; on the other hand they speak of
' attri-
butes of numbers
' and of numbers as
' the caitses of the thinp-s
o
which exist and take place in the heaven both from the begin-
ning and now
'.
Again, according
to them, abstractions and
immaterial things are
also numbers, and they place them in
different
regions
;
for
example,
in
one
region
thej^
place
opinion and oppoi'tunity, and in another, a little higher up or
lower
down,
such
things
as
injustice,
sifting,
or
mixing.
Is
it
this
same
'number
in
the
heaven' which we must
assume each of these things to
be, or a number other than
this number ? ^
May we not infer from these scattered remarks of Aristotle
about
the
Pythagorean
doctrine
that
'the number
in
the
heaven
'
is
the
number
of
the
visible
stars,
made
up
of
units
which
are
material
points'?
And may
this
not
be
the
origin
of
the
theory
that
all
things
are
numbers,
a
theory which of course would be confirmed when the further

capital discovery was made that musical harmonies depend
on numerical
ratios,
the octave representing
the
ratio

:
1
in length of string, the fifth 3
: 2 and the fourth 4:3?
The use by the Pythagoreans of visible points to represent
the units of a number of a particular form is illustrated by
the remark of Aristotle that
' Eurytus
settled what
is
the. number
of what
object
(e.g.
this
is the number of a man, that of a horse) and imitated
the shapes of living things by pebbles after
the ynanner of

or

treated
the

as a

as

Definitions
of the unit and
of number.
Aristotle observes that the One
is reasonably regarded as
not being itself a number, because a measure is not the things
measured, but the measure or the One
is the beginning (or
principle) of number.^
This doctrine may be of Pythagorean
origin
; Nicomaehus has it ^
;
Euclid implies
it when he says
that a unit
is that by virtue of which each of existing things
is called one, while a number
is 'the multitude made up of
units''; and the statement was generally accepted.
According
to lamblichus,** Thymaridas (an ancient Pythagorean, probably
not
later than Plato's time) defined a unit as
' limiting quan-
tity
' {nepaifovaa ttoo-ottjs) or, as we might say, 'limit of few-
ness
', while some Pythagoreans called
it
' the confine between
number
and
parts
',
i. e.
that
which
separates
multiples
and submultiples.
Chrysippus
(third century
B.C.)
called
it
'multitude
one'
{nXfjOos
eV),
a
definition
objected
to
by
lamblichus as a contradiction in
terms, but important
as an
attempt to bring
1 into the conception of number.
The first definition of number is attributed to Thales, who
defined it as a collection of units

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
ing the Egyptian view '}
The Pj^thagoreans
' made number
out of one'^; some of them
called
it
' a progression of multi-
tude beginning from a unit and a regression ending in
it '.'
(Stobaeus
credits Moderatus, a Neo-Pythagorean of the time
of Nero, with
this
definition.*)
Eudoxus defined number as
a
' determinate
multitude
'
(nXfjOo^

Nicoma-
chus has yet another definition,
' a flow of quantity made up
of units
'
"

Aris-
totle gives a number of definitions equivalent to one or other
of those just mentioned,
' limited multitude

' multitude (or
' combination
') of units ',^
' multitude of indivisibles
',^
' several
ones' (eVa
TrXeta)),^"
' multitude measurable by one ',^^ 'multi-
tude measured ', and
' multitude of measures
' ^^ (the measure
being the unit).
Classification
of numbers.
The
distinction between odd
(Trepitrcroy) and even {dpnos)
doubtless goes back
to Pythagoras.
A
Philolaus fragment
says that
' number is of two special kinds, odd and even, with
a third, even-odd, arising from a mixture of the two
; and of
each kind there are many forms '.^^
According to Nicomachus,
the Pytliagorean definitions of odd and even were these
' An even number is that which admits of being divided, by
one and the same operation,
into the greatest and the
least
parts, greatest in size but least in number
(i. e. into tv:o halves)
.
.
., while an odd number is that which cannot be so divided
liut is only divisible into two unequal parts.'
'''
Nicomachus gives another ancient
definition
to the
efliect
that
' an even number is that which can be divided both into two
equal
parts and
into two unequal
parts
(except the funda-
mental dyad which can only be divided into two equal parts),
but, however it is divided, must have its two parts of the same
]dnd without part in the other kind
(i. e. the two parts are

CLASSIFICATION OF NUMBERS

both odd or both even); while an odd number
is that which,
however divided, must in any case fall into two unequal parts,
and
those parts always belonging to the two different kinds
respectively
(i.e. one being odd and one even).' ^
In
the
latter
definition we have
a
trace
of the
original
conception of 2 (the dyad) as being, not a number at
all, but
the principle or beginning of the even, just as one was not a
number but the principle or beginning of number
; the defini-
tion implies that
2 was not originally regarded as an even
number, the qualification made by Nicomachus with reference
to the dyad being evidently a later addition
to the original
definition (Plato already speaks of two as even).^
With regard to the term
' odd-even
',
it
is to be noted that
according to Aristotle, the Pythagoreans held that
' the One
arises from both kinds (the odd and the even), for it
is both
even and odd '.^
The explanation of this strange view might
apparently be that the unit, being the principle of all number,
even as weU as odd, cannot itself be odd and must therefore
be called even-odd.
There
is, however, another explanation,
attributed byTheon of Smyrna to Aristotle, to the effect that the
unit when added to an even number makes an odd number, but
when added to an odd number makes an even number
: which
could not be the case
if
it did not partake
of both
species
;
Theon also mentions Archytas as being in agreement with this
view.*
But, inasmuch as the fragment of Philolaus speaks of
' many forms
'
of the
species odd and
even, and
' a
third
(even-odd)
obtained from a combination
of
them,
it
seems
more natural
to
take
' even-odd
'
as there meaning, not the
unit, but the product of an odd and an even number, while, if
' even
' in the same passage excludes such a number,
' even
would appear to be confined to powers of 2, or 2".
We
do
not know how
far
the
Pythagoreans
advanced
towards the later elaborate
classification
of the
varieties
of
odd and even numbers.
But they presumably had
not got
beyond the point of view of Plato and
Euclid.
In Plato we

terms

TTepiTTaKLs;) and 'even-times odd'
{irepiTTa
dpriccKis), which
are evidently used in the simple sense of the products of even
and
even, odd and
odd, odd and
even, and
even and odd
factors respectively.^
Euclid's classification does not go much
beyond
this;
he does not attempt
to make the four
defini-
tions mutually exclusive.^
An
' odd-times odd
â€¢" number is of
course any odd number which
is not prime
; but
' even-times
even
'
(' a number measured by an even number according
to
an
even number ')
does not
exclude
' even-times odd
'
(' a
number measured by an even number according to an odd
number');
e.g.
24, which
is
6 times
4, or 4 times
6, is also
8 times
3.
Euclid did not apparently distinguish, any more
than Plato, between
' even-times odd
' and
' odd-times even
(the
definition of the
latter
in the texts of Euclid was pro-
bably
interpolated).
The Neo-Pythagoreans improved
the
classification thus.
With them the
' even-times even
' number
is that which has
its halves even, the halves
of the halves
even, and so on till unity is reached
' ^
; in short, it is a number
of the form 2".
The
' even-odd
' number {dprionepiTTOi in one
word)
is such a number
as, when once halved, leaves as quo-
tient an odd number,*
i.e. a number of the form
2 (2m 4-1).
The
' odd-even
' number {TrepLaadprios) is a number such that
it can be halved
twice or more times
successively, but the
quotient left when
it can no longer be halved is an odd num-
ber not unity,* i.e. it
is a number of the form
2"+^ (27?i+l).
The
' odd-times
odd
' number
is
not
defined
as
such
by
Nicomachus and
lamblichus, but Theon
of Smyrna
quotes
a curious use of the term
; he says
that
it was one of the
names applied
to prime numbers (excluding of course
2), for
these have two odd factors, namely
1 and the number itself."
Prime or incomposite numbers (rrpwros Kal
da-vudiTos) and
secondary or composite numbers
{Sevrepos
Kal
avvOiTo^)
are
distinguished in a fragment of Speusippus based upon works
of Philolaus.'
We are told * that Thymaridas called a prime
number rectilinear {(vdvypaixfiiKos), the ground being that

CLASSIFICATION OF NUMBERS

of
it, excluding the number
itself,
is
1); Theon
of Smyrna
gives euthymetric and linear as alternative terms/ and
the
latter (ypafifiiKos) also occurs in the fragment of Speusippus.
Strictly speaking, the prime number should have been called
that which
is
rectilinear or linear
only.
As we have
seen,.
2 was not originally regarded as a prime number, or even as
a number at
all.
But Aristotle speaks of the dyad as
' the
only even number which is prime,' ^ showing that this diver-
gence
from
early Pythagorean
doctrine
took
place
before
Euclid's time.
Euclid defined a prime number as
' that which
is measured by a unit alone ',^ a composite number as
' that
which
is measured by some number ',* while he adds
defini-
tions of numbers
' prime
to one another
'
(' those which are
measured by a unit
alone as
a common measure ')
and
of
numbers
' composite to one another
'
(' those which are mea-
sured by some number as a common measure ').^
Euclid then,
as well as Aristotle, includes 2 among prime numbers.
Theon
of Smyrna says that even numbers are not measured by the
unit alone, except
2, which therefore is odd-like without being
prime."
The Neo-Pythagoreans, Nicomachus and lamblichus,
not only exclude 2 from prime numbers, but define composite
numbers, numbers prime
to one another, and numbers com-
posite to one another as excluding
all even numbers
;
they
make all these categories subdivisions of oddJ
Their object
is to divide odd into three classes parallel to the three subdivi-
sions of even, namely even-even = 2", even-odd = 2 (2m -I- 1)
and the quasi-intermediate odd-even = 2""*"^ (2m -I- 1)
; accord-
ingly
they
divide
odd
numbers
into
(a)
the
prime
and
incomposite, which, are
Euclid's primes excluding
2,
(6)
the
secondary and composite, the factors of which must all be not
only odd but prime numbers, (c) those which are
' secondary and
composite in themselves but prime and incomposite to another
number,' e.g.
9 and 25, which are both secondary and com-
posite but have no common measure except
1.
The incon-
venience of the restriction
in (h) is obvious, and there
is the

' Perfect
' and
' Friendly
' numbers.
There
is no trace in the fragments of Philolaus, in Plato or
Aristotle, or anj'where before Euclid, of the perfect number
(reXetoy)
in
the
well-known
sense
of
Euclid's
definition
(VII.
Def.
22), a number,
namely, which
is
' equal
to
(the
sum
of)
its own
parts'
(i.e.
all
its
factors
including
1),
e.g.
6=1+2 + 3;
28 = 1+2 + 4 + 7 + 14;-^
496= 1+2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 + 248.
The
law
of
the
formation
of
these numbers
is proved
in
Eucl. IX. 36, which
is
to the
effect
that,
if the sum
of any
number of terms of the series 1 , 2, 2^,
2=*
2"-i
( = SJ is prime,
then
>S'â€ž
. 2"~i is a
' perfect
' number.
Theon of Smyrna ^ and
Nicomachus ^ both define a
' perfect
' number and explain the
law of
its formation
;
they further distinguish from
it two
other kinds of numbers,
(1) over-perfect
(vrrepTeXris or vTrepre-
Xeios),
so
called because
the sum of
all
its aliquot
parts
is
greater than
the number
itself,
e.g.
12, which
is
less than
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6,
(2)
defective (eWnrrjs),
so called because the
sum of
all
its aliquot parts
is
less than
the number
itself,
e. g.
8, which
is greater than 1+2 + 4.
Of perfect numbers
Nicomachus knew four (namely
6, 28, 496, 8128) but no more.
He says they are formed in
' ordered
' fashion, there being one
among the units
(i.e. less than 10), one among the tens
(less
than 100), one among the hundreds
(less than 1000), and one
among the thousands (less than a myriad)
; he adds that they
terminate alternately in 6 or 8.
They do all terminate in 6 or
8 (as we can easily prove by means of the formula (2"â€” 1) 2""^),
but not
altei'nately, for the
fifth and sixth perfect numbers
both end
in
6, and the seventh and eighth both end in
8.
lamblichus
adds
a
tentative suggestion
that
there may
(ei
TV)(oi) in like manner be one perfect number among the first
myriads
(less
than
10000^), one among the second myriads
(less than 10000^), and so on ud infinitum.^
This is incorrect,
for the next perfect numbers are as follows

With
these
' perfect
' numbers
should
be compared
the
so-
called
' friendly numbers
'.
Two numbers are
' friendly
' when
each is the sum of all the aliquot parts of the other, e.g. 284 and
220
(for 284 =
1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11+ 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110,
while 220 =
1 + 2 +4 + 71 + 142).
lambhchus
attributes the
discovery of such numbers to Pythagoras himself, who, being
asked
' what is a friend ?
' said
' Alter ego
', and on this analogy
applied the term
' friendly
' to two numbers the aliquot parts
of either of which make up the other.^
While
for
Euclid, Theon
of Smyrna, and the Neo-Pytlia-
goreans the
' perfect
' number was the kind of number above
described, we
are
told
that
the
Pythagoreans made
10 the
perfect number.
Aristotle says that
this was because they
found within
it such things as the void, proportion, oddness,
and
so on.^
The reason is explained more in detail by Theon
of Smyrna^ and
in the fragment of Speusippus.

is the
sum of the numbers
1,
2, 3, 4 forming the rerpaKTVi
(' their
greatest oath
', alternatively called the
' principle of health
' *).
These numbers include the ratios corresponding to the musical
intervals discovered by Pythagoras, namely 4
: 3 (the fourth),
though he does not give it
;
it was, however, known, with
all
its factors,
in
the
fifteenth century,
as appears from
a
tract
written
in German
which was
discovered by Curtze
(Cod.
lat.
Monac.
14908).
The
iirst
eight
'perfect' numbers were
calculated by Jean
Prestet
(d.
1670);
Fermat
(1601-65) had
stated, and Euler proved, that
2^'-l
is
prime.
The ninth perfect number was found by P. SeelhofF, Zeitschr. f. Math.
ti.
Phyaik,
1886,
pp. 174 sq.) and
verified by E. Lucas [Mathhis, vii, 1887,

(Bull. Amer. Math.
Soc, 1912, p. 162).

The subject
of 'friendly numbers

less than sixty-one pairs of
such numbers.

pairs but no more.

Speusippus observes
further that 10 contains in
it the 'linear', 'plane' and 'solid'
varieties of number
; for
1 is a point, 2 is a Hne,^ 3 a triangle,
and 4 a pyramid.^
Figured numbers.
This brings us once more to the theory of figured numbers,
which seems
to go back
to Pythagoras himself.
A point or
dot
is used
to represent
1
; two dots placed apart represent
, 2, and at the same time define the
straight
line joining the
two
dots
;
three
dots,
representing
3, mark
out
the
first
rectilinear plane figure, a triangle
;
four dots, one of which
is
outside the plane containing the other three, represent 4 and
also define
the
first
rectilineal
solid
figure.
It
seems
clear
that the oldest Pythagoreans were acquainted with the forma-
tion of triangular and square numbers by means of pebbles or
dots^; and we judge from the account
of Speusippus's book,
On the Pythagorean Numbers, which was based on works of
Philolaus, that the latter dealt with linear numbers, polygonal
numbers, and plane and solid numbers of all
sorts, as well as
with
the five regular
solid
figures.*
The
varieties
of plane
numbers
(triangular,
square, oblong,
pentagonal,
hexagonal,
and
so
on),
solid numbers
(cube, pyramidal, &c.) are
all
dis-
cussed, with the methods of their formation, by Nicomachus ^
and Theon of Smyrna."

This connects the know-

Square numbers and gnomons.
We come now to squai^e numbers.^
It
is easy to see that, if
we have a number of dots forming and
filling
up a square as in the accompanying figure repre-
senting
16,
the
square
of
4,
the
next higher
square, the square of 5, can be formed by adding
a row of
dots round two
sides of the
original
square, as shown; the number
of these dots
is
2
. 4 -M, or 9.
This process of forming successive squares can
be
applied
throughout,
beginning
from
the
first
square
number
1 .
The successive additions are shown in the annexed
figure between the successive pairs of straight
lines forming right angles
; and the succes-
sive numbers added to the

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
(y)
History of the term
' gnomon '.
It
will
be noticed that
the gnomons shown in the above
figure correspond in shape to the geometrical gnomons with
which Euclid, Book II, has made us familiar.
The history of
the word
' gnomon
' is interesting.
(1)
It was
originally an
astronomical instrument for the measuring of time, and con-
sisted of an upright
stick which cast shadows on a plane or
hemispherical surface.
This instrument
is said to have been
introduced into Greece by Anaximander ^ and
to have come
from Babylon.^
Following on
this
application of the word
' gnomon
' (a
' marker
' or
' pointer
', a means of reading off and
knowing something), we find Oenopides calling a perpendicular
let fall on a straight line from an external point a straight line
drawn
' gnomon-iuise
' (kuto. yvaifiova.).^
Next (2) we find the
term used of an instrument for drawing right
angles, which
took the form shown in the annexed figure.
This seems to
be the meaning in Theognis 805, where
it is said
tliat the envoy sent to consult the oracle at Delphi
should be
' straighter than the ropvos (an
instru-
I
ment with a stretched string for drawing a circle),
the
(TTadfir)
(a
plumb-line),
and
the
gnomon'.
It was natural
that, owing to
its shape, the gnomon should
then be used
to
describe
(3)
the
figure which remained
of
a square when a smaller square was cut out of it (or the figure
which, as Aristotle
says, when added
to a
square, preserves
the shape and makes up a larger square).
The term is used
in a fragment of Philolaus where he says that
' number makes
all things knowable and mutually agreeing in the way charac-
teristic
of the gnomon'.*
Presumably, ^s Boeckh
says, the
connexion l^etween the gnomon and the square to which it is
added was regarded as symbolical of union and
agreement,
and
Philolaus
used
the
idea
to explain
the knowledge
of
things, making
the
knowing
embrace
the
knoiun
as
the
gnomon
does
the
square.'^
(4) In
Euclid
the
geometrical
meaning of the word
is further extended (II. Def. 2) to cover

the figure
similarly related
to any parallelogram, instead of
a square
;
it is defined as made up of
' any
one whatever of the parallelograms about
the diameter
(diagonal) with the two com-
plements
'.
Later
still
(5) Heron of Alex-
andria defines a gnomon in general as that
which, when added to anything, number or figure, makes the
whole similar to that to which it is added.^
(S)
Gnomons of the polygonal numbers.
Theon of Smyrna uses the term in this general sense with
reference to numbers
:
' All the successive numbers which [by
being
successively
added]
produce
triangles
or
squares
or
polygons
are
called
gnomons.' ^
From
the
accompanying
figures showing successive pentagonal and hexagonal numbers
it will be seen that the outside rows or gnomons to be succes-
sively added after 1 (which is the first pentagon, hexagon, &c.)
are in the case of the pentagon
4,
7, 10
,
.
. or the terms of an
arithmetical progression beginning from
1 with common differ-
ence
3, and in
the case of the hexagon
5,
9, 13 .... or the
terms of an -arithmetical progression beginning from
1 with
common
diff'erence
4.
In
general
the
successive gnomonic
numbers
for
any polygonal
number,
say
of w
sides, have
(n â€” 2) for their common difference.^
(e)
Right-angled triangles with
sides in rational numhers.
To return to Pythagoras.
Whether he learnt the fact from
Egypt
or
not, Pythagoras was
certainly aware
that, while
32 -1- 42 = 52, any triangle with
its
sides

ratio

is right angled.
This fact could not but add
strength to his conviction that all things were numbers, for it
established a connexion between numbers and the angles of
geometrical
figures.
It
would
also
inevitably
lead
to
an
attempt
to find other square numbers
besides
5^ which are
the sum of two
squares, or, in other words, to find other sets
of
three integral numbers which can be made
the
sides of
right-angled triangles
; and herein we have the beginning of
the indeterminate analysis which reached so high a stage of
development
in
Diophantus.
In view of
the
fact that the
sum of any number of successive terms of the
series of odd
numbers
1,
3, 5, 7
.
.
. beginning from
1
is a
square,
it was
only necessary
to pick out of
this
series
the odd numbers
which are themselves squares
;
for if we take one of
these,
say 9, the addition of this square to the square which is the sum
of
all the preceding odd numbers makes the square number
which is the sum of the odd numbers up to the number (9) that
we have taken.
But
it would be natural
to seek a formula
which should enable all the three numbers of a set to be imme-
diately written down, and such a formula is actually attributed
to Pythagoras.^
This formula amounts to the statement that,
if m be any odd number.
Pythagoras would presumably arrive at this method of forma-
tion in the following way.
Observing that the gnomon put
.round
n"^
is 2n+l, he would only have
to make 2n+l a
square.
If we suppose that
2n+l = m^,
we obtain
n = f (m'"â€” 1),
and therefore
n+1 = ^ (m^ -1-1).
It follows that

I, p. 487. 7-21.

RATIONAL RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLES
81
Another formula, devised for the same purpose, is attributed
to Plato,^ namely
(2m)2-|-(m2-l)2 = (m2+l)2.
We could obtain
this formula from
that
of Pythagoras by
doubling the sides of each square in the latter
; but
it would
be incomplete
if so obtained, for in Pythagoras's formula m is
necessarily odd, whereas in Plato's it need not be.
As Pytha-
goras's formula was most probably obtained from the gnomons
of
dots, it
is tempting
to suppose that
Plato's was similarly
evolved.
Consider the square with n dots in its
side in relation to the next smaller square {nâ€”lf
and the next larger
(71 -1-1)^.
Then n^ exceeds
(nâ€”iy by the gnomon
2 )iâ€” 1, but falls short of
(w-H)^ by
the gnomon 2n + l.
Therefore
the
square
(-n.-1-l)^
exceeds
the
square
(nâ€”l)'^ by
the sum
of
the two gnomons 2nâ€”l
and
2?i-|-l,
which
is 4Â«.
That is,
in + {)i- l)'^ = {n + l)^
and, substituting
-ni^ for
ii in order to make in
a, square, wo
obtain the Platonic formula
{2mf + im^-lf =
(77i2-|-l)2.
The formulae
of Pythagoras and
Plato
supplement
each
other.
Euchd's
solution
(X, Lemma following Prop.
28)
is
more general, amounting to the following.

where

and consequently

In order that uv may be a
square, says
Euclid, u and
v
must, if they are not actually squares, be
' similar plane num-
bers

(^)
Oblong numbers,
Pythagoras, or the earliest Pythagoreans, having discovered
that, by adding any number of successive terms (beginning
from
1) of the series
1 + 2 + 3+
... + n = ^n (n + l), we obtain
triangular numbers, and that by adding the successive odd
numbers
1 + 3 + 5 + ... +(2 7iâ€” 1) = n^ we obtain
squares,
it
cannot
be doubted
that
in
like manner
they summed
the
series
of
even
numbers
2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 2n = n{n+l)
and
discovered accordingly that the sum of any number of succes-
sive terms of the
series beginning with
2 was an
' oblong
number
(eVepoyUT^/o/y), with^ 'sides' or factors
differing by
1.
They would
also
see that the oblong number
is
double
of
a triangular number.
These facts would be brought out by
taking two dots representing 2 and then placing round them,
gnomon-wise and
successively, the
even numbers
4,
6,
&c.,
thus
:
t
The successive oblong numbers are
2.3 = 6,
3.4 = 12,
4.5 = 20...,
n(n + l)...,
and
it
is clear that no two of these numbers are similar, for
the
ratio n:(n+l)
is
different for
all
different values of n.
We may have here an explanation of the Pythagorean identi-
fication of
' odd
' with
' limit
' or
' limited
' and of
' even
' with

OBLONG NUMBERS
83
' unlimited
' ^
(cf.
the Pythagorean
scheme
of
ten
pairs
of
opposites, where odd, limit and square in one set are opposed
to even, unlimited and oblong respectively in the other). ^
For,
while the adding of the successive odd numbers as gnomons
round
1
gives only one form, the square, the addition of the
successive even numbers to
2 gives a succession of
' oblong
'
numbers
all dissimilar in form, that
is to say, an infinity
of
forms.
This seems to be indicated in the passage of Aristotle's
Physics where, as an
illustration of the view that the even
is unlimited, he says
that, where gnomons are put round
1,
the
resulting
figures
are
in
one
case
always
different
in
species, while in the other they always preserve one form ^
;
the one form
is of course the square formed by adding the
odd numbers
as gnomons
round
1
;
the
words
Kal
^wph
(' and in the
separate case
',
as we may perhaps
translate)
imperfectly
describe
the
second
case,
since
in
that
case
even numbers
are
put
round
2,
not
1,
but
the
meaning
seems
clear.*
It
is
to
be noted
that
the word
ere/jo/zTj/CT/y
(' oblong ')
is in Theon of Smyrna and Nicomachus limited
to
numbers which are the product
of two factors
differing by
unity, while they apply the term
TrpofiTJKrjs
('prolate', as
it
were)
to numbers which are the product of factors differing
by two or more (Theon makes TrpofirjKijs include irepofirJKTjs).
In Plato and Aristotle irepojx-qKrjs has the wider sense of any
non-square number with two unequal factors.
It
is
obvious that any
' oblong
' number n {n + 1)
is the
sum of two equal triangular numbers.
Scarcely less obvious
is the theorem of Theon that any square number is made up
of two triangular numbers ^
;
in this case, as

THE THEORY OF PROPORTION AND MEANS
85
Fabricius.
avakoywv is not the correct form of the word, but
the meaning would be
' proportions
' or
' proportionals
', and
the true reading may be either roof dvaXoymv ('proportions'),
or, more
probably,
rmu
dva
\6yov
('proportionals');
Diels
reads tmv dvd \6yov, and
it would seem that there
is now
general agreement that aXoymv is wrong, and that the theory
which Proclus meant to attribute to Pythagoras is the theory
oi 2^0-portion or 'proportionals, not of in-ationals.
(a)
Arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means.
It is true that we have no positive evidence of the use by
Pythagoras
of
proportions
in
geometry, although
he must
have been conversant with similar figures, which imply some
theory of proportion.
But he discovered the dependence of
musical intervals on numerical ratios, and the theory of means
was
developed
very
early
in
his
school
with
reference
to
the
theory
of
music and
arithmetic.
We
are
told that
in
Pythagorass time there
were
three
means,
the
arithmetic,
the geometric, and the subcontrary, and that the name of the
third
(' subcontrary ') was changed by Archytas and Hippasus
to 'harmonic'.^
A fragment of Archytas's work On Music
actually
defines
the
three
;
we have
the
arithm,etic mean
when,
of
three
terms,
the
first exceeds
the
second by the
same amount as the second exceeds the third
; the geometric
mean when, of the three terms, the
first
is to the second as
the second
is to the third
; the
' subcontrary, which we
call
harm,onic ', when the three terms are such that
' by whatever
part of
itself the
first exceeds the second, the second exceeds
the third hy the same part of the third '.^
That
is, if
a,
b, c
are in harmonic progression, and a = b +
> we must have
6 = c +
5
whence in fact
n

' = I

or

Uj
Nicomachus too says that
the name
' harmonic mean
' was
adopted in accordance with the view of Philolaus about the
' geometrical harmony
', a name applied to the cube because
it
has
12
edges,
8
angles, and
6
faces, and
8
is
the mean

TrjV apfiovLKrjv)}
lambliehus,^
after Nicomachus,^ mentions a
special
' most
perfect
proportion
'
consisting
of
four
terms
and
called
'musical',
which, according
to
tradition, was discovered by
the
Babylonians and
was
first
introduced
into
Greece by
Pythagoras.
It was
used, he
says, by many Pythagoreans,
e. g. (among others) Aristaeus
of Croton, Timaeus of
Locri,
Philolaus and Archytas
of Tarentum, and
finally by Plato
in the Timaeus, where we are told that the double and triple
intervals were
filled up
bj- two means, one of which exceeds
and
is
exceeded by
the
same
part
of
the
extremes
(the
harmonic mean), and
the other exceeds and
is exceeded by
the same numerical magnitude (the arithmetic
mean).''

an example being 12:9 = 8:6.
(/S)
Seven other means distinguished.
The theory of means was further developed in the school
by the gradual
addition
of seven
others to the
first three,
making ten
in
all.
The
accounts
of
the
discovery
of
the
fourth, fifth, and sixth are not quite consistent.
In one place
lamblichus
says they were added by Eudoxus Â®
;
in
other
places he says they were
in use by the
successors of Plato
down to Eratosthenes, but that Archytas and Hippasus made
a beginning with
their discovery," or that they were part of
the Archytas and Hippasus
tradition.'
The remaining four
means (the seventh to the tenth) are said to have been added
by two later Pythagoreans, Myonides and Euphranor.*
From
a remark of Porphyry it would appear that one
of the
first
seven
means was
discovered by
Sinius
of
Posidonia,
but
that the jealousy of other Pythagoreans would have
I'obbed
him
of
the
credit.'

means

theorem of Archytas.
Another
interesting theorem
relative
to geometric means
evidently goes back
to the Pythagoreans.
If we have two
numbers in the ratio known as kniiiopio^, or suiJeriMrticularis,
i.e. the ratio of n+\ to n, there can be no number which
is
a mean proportional between them.
The theorem is Prop. 3 of
Euclid's Sectio Canonis,^ and Boetius has preserved a proof
of it by Archytas, which is substantially identical with that of
Euclid.3
The proof will be given later (pp. 215-1 6).
So far as
this chapter is concerned, the importance of the proposition lies
in the
fact that
it
implies the
existence, at
least
as early
as the date of Archytas (about *430-365 B.C.), of an Elements
of Arithnietic in the form which we
call Euclidean
; and no
doubt text-books of
the
sort
existed even
before Archytas,
which probably Archytas himself and others after him im-
proved and developed in their turn.
The
'irrational'.
We mentioned above the dictum of Proclus
(if the reading
aXoycov
is
right)
that Pythagoras discovered
the
theory, or
study,
of
irrationals.
This
subject
was
regarded
by
the
Greeks
as
belonging
to
geometry
rather
than
arithmetic.
The
irrationals in
Euclid, Book X, are straight lines or areas,
and Proclus mentions as
special topics
in geometry matters
relating (l) to positions (for numbers have no position),
(2) to
contacts
(for tangency is between continuous things), and (3)
to irrational straight
lines
(for where
there
is
division ad
infinitum,
there
also
is
the
irrational).*
I
shall
therefore
postpone
to Chapter V on
the
Pythagorean
geometry
the
question of the date of the discovery of the theory of
irra-
tionals.

THE
IRRATIONAL'
91
diagonal of a square with
its
side, that
is, the
' irrationality
of
a/2, was discovered
in the school of Pythagoras, and
it is
more appropriate
to deal with this particular case here, both
because
the
traditional
proof
of
the
fact
depends
on
the
elementary theory of numbers, and because the Pythagoreans
invented a method
of obtaining an
infinite
series of
arith-
metical ratios approaching more and more closely to the value
of 72.
The actual method by which the Pythagoreans proved the
fact that
-/2
is incommensurable with
1 was doubtless that
indicated by Aristotle, a reductio ad absurdum showing that,
if the diagonal of a square
is commensurable with
its side, it
will follow that the same number is both odd and even.^
This
is evidently the proof interpolated in the texts of Euclid as
X. 117, which is in substance as follows
:
Suppose AC, the diagonal of a square, to be commensur-
able with AB,
its
side
;
let a
:
/3 be their
ratio expressed
in
the smallest possible numbers.
Then (X> /3, and therefore a is necessarily > 1
.
Now
AC^
: AB- = a^
: fi^
;
and, since
AC^ = 2 AB'^,
a^ = 2 /S^-
Hence a^, and therefore a, is even.
Since a
: /?
is in
its lowest terms,
it follows that
/3 must
be odd.
Let a = 2 y
;
therefore
4 y- = 2 I3\ or 2 y^ =
/S^, so that /S^,
and therefore
j8, is even.
But /3 was also odd
: which is impossible.
Therefore
the diagonal AC cannot be commensurable with
the side AB.

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
and diameter- (diagonal-) numbers respectively.
The law of
formation of these numbers is explained by Theon of Smyrna,
and is as follows.^
The unit, being the beginning of all things,
must be potentially both a side and a diameter.
Consequently
we begin with two units, the one being the first side, which we
will call
ftj, the other being the first diameter, which we will
call
c/j.
The second side and diameter (a^, d^) are formed from the
first, the third side and diameter {a^, d^) from the i-x'cond, and
so on, as follows
a^ = Â«! + cZj
,
c?2 = 2 ffj + cZj
a^ â€” a^ + d.^,
d^=2a2 + d^,
Since a^ = d^ â€”
1, it follows that
ttj =
1 + 1 =
2,
f/g = 2
.
1 + 1 =
3,
a^ = 2 + 3=
5,
(^3=2.2 + 3=
7,
a^=5-|-7=12,
^4 = 2. 5 + 7 = 17,
and so on.
Theon
states, with reference to these numbers, the general
proposition that
cZâ€ž2=2aâ€ž"+l,
and he observes (1) that the signs alternate as successive d's
and
a's
are
taken, d^^~2a^' being
equal
to -\,d^-2a^
equal
to +1, d^^-2a^^ equal
to -1, and so on, while
(2) the
sum of the squares of all the
d's, will be double of the squares
oi
all the
a's.
[If the number of successive terms
in
each-
series is finite, it is of course necessary that the numbei- should
be even.]
The properties stated depend on the truth of the following
identity
{2x + yf-2{x + yf = 2x^-y^;
for, if X, y be numbers which satisfy one of the two equations
2:c^-y^=Â±l,
the formula
(if
true) gives us two higher numbers, x + y and
2x + y, which satisfy the other of the two equations.
Not only
is the identity true, but we know from Proclus
' Theon of Smyrna, pp. 48, 44.

how
it was
proved.^
Observing that
'it
is proved by him
(Euclid) graphically
(ypa/i/tt/cwy) in the Second Book of the
Elements',
Froclus
adds
the
enunciation
of
Eucl.
II.
10.
This proposition proves that, if ^B
is bisected at G and pro-
duced to D, then
41)2 -^ i)jS2 = 2 ^C2 + 2 Ci)^
and, ii AG = GB = x and BD = y, this gives
(2x + yf + y- ^2x^ + 2{x + yf,
or
{2x->ryf-2{x-^yf = 2x^-y'^,
which is the formula required.
We can
of course prove the property of consecutive
side-
and diameter- numbers algebraically thus
:
^: - 2 aâ€ž2 = (2 aâ€ž_i + c^â€ž_i)2 - 2 (a,â€ž_j + d^^^''
= 4- {d^_^â€”2 aâ€ž_^''), in like manner
;
and so on.
In the famous passage of the Republic (546 c) dealing with
the
geometrical
number
Plato
distinguishes
between
the
' irrational diameter of 5
', i.e. the diagonal of a square having
5
for
its
side,
or
-/(SO), and what
he
calls
the
'rational
diameter' of
5.
The square of the 'rational diameter' is less
by
1 than the square of the
' irrational diameter
', and iÂ§ there-
fore
49,
so that the 'rational diameter' is
7;
that
is,
Plato
refers to the fact that 2
. 6^â€” 7^ =
1, and he has in mind the
particular pair of side- and diameter- numbers, 5 and 7, which
must therefore have been known before his time.
As the proof
of the property of these numbers in general is found, as Proclus
says, in the geometrical theorem of Eucl. II. 10,
it
is a
fair
inference
that
that theorem
is
Pythagorean, and was prob-
ably invented for the special purpose.

already

the
author
of
a
rule
for solving a
certain set of n simultaneous simple equations connecting n
unknown quantities.
The rule was evidently well known, for
it was called by the special name of kTrdvOr^fia, the
' flower
' or
' bloom
'
of Thymaridas.^
(The term

of the

'arithmetical knavOrjiiara' and
eTrav6rj/j.aTa
of

The rule is stated in general terms and no
symbols are used, but the content is pure algebra.
The known
or determined quantities
(mpicr/j.ei'oi')
are distinguished from
the undetermined

{dopiarov), the term
for

latter being the very word used by Diophantus in the expres-
sion nXfjOos fiovdSonv dopicrTov,
' an undefined or undetermined

describes his

From these equations we obtain
x + y + z + u = {a+\){z + u) = (6+1) {u + y) = {c+l) {y + z).
If now X, y, z, u are
all
to be
integers, x + y + z + u must
contain a-hl,b+l,c + l as factors.
If L be the least common
multiple of a + l, 6 + i, c + 1, we can put x + y + z + u= L, and
we obtain from the above equations in pairs

Area of rectangles in relation
to perimeter.
Sluse,^ in letters to Huygens dated Oct. 4, 1657, and Oct. 25,
1658,
alludes
to
a property
of
the numbers
16
and
18
of
which he had read somewhere in Plutarch that
it was known
to
the
Pythagoreans,
namely
that
each
of
these numbers
represents the perimeter as well as the area
of a rectangle
for 4

. 4 + 2
. 4 and 3.6 = 2.3 + 2.6.
I have not found the
passage of Plutarch, but the property of
1 6 is mentioned in the
Theologumena Arithmetices, where it is said that
1 6 is the only
square the area of which
is equal
to
its perimeter, the peri-
meter of smaller squares being greater, and that of all larger
squares being less, 'than the area.^
We do not know whether
the Pythagoreans proved that
1 6 and
1 8 were the only num-
bers having the property in question
; but it is likely enough
that they did, for the proof amounts to finding the integral

This
is easy, for the equation
is
equivalent to {x-2) {y-2) =
4, and we have
only
to equate
x â€” 2 and yâ€”2 to the respective factors of
4.
Since 4 is only
divisible into integral factors in two ways, as 2

we get, as the only possible solutions for x, y,

Systematic
treatises on arithmetic (theory
of
numbers).
It
will
be
convenient
to
include
in
this
chapter
some
account of the arithmetic of
the
later
Pythagoreans, begin-
ning
with
NicOMACHUS.
If any
systematic
treatises
on
arithmetic were ever written between Euclid (Books VII-IX)
and
Nicomachus,
none
have
survived.
Nicomachus,
of
Gerasa,
probably
the
Gerasa
in Judaea
east
of
the
river
Jordan,
flourished
about
100
A.D.,
for, on the one
hand, in
a work of his entitled the Enchiridion Harvionices there
is
an allusion to Thrasyllus, who arranged the Platonic dialogues,
wrote on music, and was the astrologer-friend of Tiberius
; on
the other hand, the Introductio Arithmetica of Nicomachus
was translated into Latin by Apuleius of Madaura under the
Antonines.
Besides the
'ApLOjiriTLKT)
eiaayaiyr], Nicomachus
is said to have written another treatise on the theology or the
mystic
properties
of numbers,
called
OeoXoyov/j-eva
dpiOfi-q-
TiKTJs,
in two Books.
The
curious farrago which has come
down to us under that title and which was edited by Ast ^
is,
however, certainly not by Nicomachus
; for among the authors
from whom it gives extracts is Anatolius, Bishop of Laodicaea
(a.D. 270); but it contains quotations from Nicomachus which
appear to come from the genuine work.
It
is possible that
Nicomachus also wrote an Introduction to Geometry, since in
one place he
says, with regard
to certain solid numbers, that
they have been specially treated
'in
the geometrical
intro-
duction, being more appropriate to the theory of magnitude '^;
but
this geometrical
introduction may not necessarily have
been a work of his own.
It
is a very far cry from Euclid to Nicomachus.

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
Introdudio
aritlimetica we
find
the
form
of
exposition
entirely
changed.
Numbers
are
represented
in
EucHd by
straight
lines with
letters attached, a system which has the
advantage that, as in algebraical notation, we can work with
numbers
in
general without
the
necessity
of giving them
specific values;
in Nicomachus numbers
are no longer
de-
noted by straight lines, so that, when diff'erent undetermined
numbers have
to be
distinguished,
this has
to be done by
circumlocution, which makes the propositions cumbrous and
hard
to
follow, and
it
is
necessary,
after each
proposition
has
been
stated,
to
illustrate
it by examples
in
concrete
numbers.
Further, there
are
no longer
any proofs
in
the
proper sense of the word
; when a general proposition has been
enunciated, Nicomachus regards
it as sufiicient
to show that
it
is true in particular instances
;
sometimes we
are
left to
infer
the
general
proposition by
induction from
particular
cases which are alone given.
Occasionally the author makes
a quite absurd remark through failure to distinguish between
the general and
the
particular
case, as when, after he
has
defined
the mean which
is
' subcontrary to the harmonic
' as
being determined by the relation
j
= -, where a>h>c,
and has given
6, 5, 3 as an illustration, he goes on to observe
that it is a property peculiar to this mean that the product of
the greatest and middle terms is double of the product of the
middle and
least,^ simply because
this happens to be true in
the
particular
case
!
Probably
Nicomachus, who
was
not
really a mathematician, intended
his Introduction to be, not
a
scientific
treatise, but a popular treatment of
the
subject
calculated to awaken in the beginner an interest in the theory
of numbers by making him acquainted with
, the most note-
worthy results obtained up to date
;
for proofs of most of
his
propositions he could refer to Euclid and doubtless to other
treatises now lost.
The style of the book confirms this hypo-
thesis
;
it
is rhetorical and highly coloured
; the properties of
numbers are made to appear marvellous and even miraculous
the most obvious relations between them are stated in turgid
language very tiresome
to read.
It was
the
mystic
rather
than
the mathematical
side
of the theory of numbers
that

interested
Nicomachus.
If
the
verbiage
is
eliminated, the
mathematical content
can be
stated
in
quite a small
com-
pass.
Little or nothing in the book
is original,
and, except
for
certain
definitions and refinements
of
classification, the
essence of
it evidently goes back to the early Pythagoreans.
Its success is difficult to explain except on the hypothesis that
it was at
first read by philosophers rather than mathemati-
cians (Pappus evidently despised
it), and afterwards became
generally popular at a time when there were no mathemati-
cians
left, but
only
philosophers who
incidentally
took an
interest in mathematics.
But a success
it undoubtedly was
;
this
is proved by the number
of versions
or commentaries
which appeared in ancient times.
Besides the Latin transla-
tion by Apuleius of Madaura (born about a.d. 125), of which
no trace remains, there was the version of Boetius (born about
480, died 524 A. D.); and the commentators include lamblichus
(fourth century), Heronas,^ Asclepius of Tralles (sixth century),
Joannes Philoponus, Proclus.^
The commentary of lamblichus
has been published,^ as also that of
Philoponus,* while that of
Asclepius
is said to be extant
in MSS.
When
(the pseudo-)
Lucian in his Philoimtris (c. 1 2) makes Critias say to Triephon
' you calculate like Nicomachus
', we have an indication that
the book was well known, although the remark may be less a
compliment than a laugh at Pythagorean subtleties.^
Book
I
of
the
Introductio, after a
philosophical
prelude
(cc. 1-6), consists principally of definitions and laws of forma-
tion.
Numbers, odd and even, are first dealt with
(c. 7); then
comes the subdivision of even into three kinds (1) evenly-even,
of the form
2", (2) even-odd, of the form 2{2n+ 1), and (3)
odd-even, of the form 2"*+^ (2 n+ 1), the last-named occupying
a
sort
of intermediate
position
in
that
it partakes
of
the
character of both the
others.
The odd
is next divided into
three kinds
:
(1) 'prime and incomposite
', (2)
' secondary and

^ Triephon tells Critias to swear by the Trinity ('One (proceeding) from
Three and Three from One '), and Critias replies,
' You would have me
learn to
calculate, for your oath
is mere arithmetic and you calculate
like Nicomachus
of Gerasa.
I do not know what you mean by your
"One-Three and Three-One";
I suppose you don't mean the rfrpa/cTi^t
of Pythagoras or the oydods or the rpiaxas ?

composite
', a product of prime factors (excluding
2, which
is
even and not regarded as prime), and (3)
' that which is in itself
secondary and composite but in relation to another is prime and
incomposite ', e.g. 9 in relation to
25, which again
is a sort of
intermediate
class between
the two
others
(cc. 11-13);
the
defects of this classification have already been noted (pp. 73-4).
In
c. 13 we have these
different classes of odd numbers ex-
hibited in a description of Eratosthenes's
' sieve
' {koctkivov), an
-appropriately named device for finding prime numbers.
The
method is this.
We set out the series of odd numbers
beajin-
ning from 3.
/
3, 5, 7,
9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31,
Now 3 is a prime number, but multiples of
3
are not
;
these
multiples,
9,
15... are got by passing over two
numbers
at
a time beginning from 3
; we therefore
strike out these num-
bers as not being prime.
Similarly 5 is a prime number, but
by passing over four numbers at a time, beginning from
5, we
get multiples of
5, namely 15,
25 ...
; we accordingly strike
out all these multiples of 5.
In general, if n be a prime num-
ber, its multiples appearing in the series are found by passing
over nâ€”l terms at a time, beginning from n
; and we can
strike out all these multiples. When we have gone far enough
with
this
process,
the numbers which
are
still
left
will be
primes.
Clearly, however, in
order
to make
sure that
the
odd number 2 to + 1
in the
series
is prime, we should have to
try
all
the prime
divisors between
3 and V{2n+l);
it
is
obvious, therefore, that this primitive empirical method would
be hopeless as a practical means of obtaining prime numbers
of any considerable size.
The same
c. 13
contains the rule for finding whether two
given numbers are prime to one another
;
it is the method of
Eucl. VII.
1, equivalent
to our rule for finding the
greatest
common measure, but Nicomachus expresses the whole thing
in words, making no use of any straight lines or symbols
to
represent the numbers.
If there is a common measure greater
than unity, the process gives
it
;
if there
is none,
i. e. if 1
is
left
as
the
last
remainder, the numbers
are prime
to
one
another.
The next chapters (cc. 14-16) are on over-perfect {vTrepTâ‚¬Xi]s),

deficient (eXXLirijs), and perfect {riXeLos) numbers respectively.
The
definitions,
the
law
of formation
of
perfect numbers,
and Nicomachus's observations thereon have been given above
(p. 74).
Next
comes
(cc.
17-23)
the
elaborate
classification
of
numerical ratios greater than unity, with their counterparts
which are less than unity.
There are five categories of each,
and under each category there is (a) the general name, (b) the
particular names
corresponding
to
the
particular numbers
taken.
The enumeration
is
tedious, but, for purposes of reference,
is given in the following table

In c. 23 Nicomachus shows how these various ratios can be
got from one another by means
of a certain
rule.
Suppose
that.
a,
b, c
are three numbers such that a:b = b:c = one
of the
ratios
described
; we form the three numbers
a,
a + b,
a + 2b + c
and also the three numbers
c,
c + b,
c + 2b + a
Two
illustrations may be given,
li a = b = c =
1, repeated
application of the
first formula gives
(1,
2,
4), then
(1,
3,
9),
then
(1,
4, 16), and
so
on, showing the
successive
multiples.
Applying the second formula to (1, 2, 4), we get
(4, 6, 9) where
the ratio is f
;
similarly from
(1,
3, 9) we get
(9, 12, 16) where
the ratio
is f
, and so on
; that
is, from the TroXXairXdo-Loi we
get
the
enifxopioi.
Again from
(9,
6,
4), where
the
ratio
is
of
the
latter kind, we get by the
first formula
(9,
15,
25),
giving the ratio
1|, an
eTnfiipTJs, and by the second formula
(4, 10, 25), giving the
ratio
2i, a vroWanXacrLtTTLfMopios.
And
so on.
Book II begins with two chapters showing how, by a con-
verse
process,
tliree terms in continued proportion with any
one of the above forms as common ratio can be reduced
to
three equal terms.
If
a,
b, c

NICOMACHUS

are the original terms, a being the
smallest, we take three
terms of the form
a,
h~a,
{c-a-2(6-a)} = c + a-26,
then apply the same rule to these three, and so on.
In ec. 3-4 it is pointed out that, if

then
^ = ':Â±1

and so on.
If we set out in rows numbers formed in this way,

,.n + 2 r""^ + r"-^
r^ + 3r2+ 3?'+ 1... ?-Â« + 3r""i + 3r""^ + r"-

the vertical rows are successive numbers in the ratio r/(r+ 1),
while
diagonally we
have
the
geometrical
series
1,
?'+l,
(r + l)2, (r+l)3....
Next follows the theory of polygonal numbers.
It is pre-
faced by
an
explanation
of
the
quasi-geometrical way
of
representing numbers by means of dots or as.
Any number
from 2 onwards can be represented as a line
; the ^j^cme num-
bers
begin with
3, which
is
the
first number
that can be
represented in the form of a triangle
; after triangles follow
squares, pentagons, hexagons, &c.
(c.
7).
Triangles
(c. 8) arise
by adding any number of successive terms, beginning with
1,
of the series of natural numbers
1,
2,
3,
...
71,
....
+ 1,

106
PYTHAGUKEAJS AKXTEnmerrro
The gnomons of triangles are therefore the successive natural
numbers.
Squares
(c. 9) are obtained by adding any number
of successive terms
of the
series
of odd numbers, beginning
with
1, or
1,
3,
5,
... 2n-l,....
Tlie gnomons
of
squares
ai'e
the
successive
odd
numbers.
Similarly the gnomons of pentagonal numbers
(c. 10)
are the
numbers forming an arithmetical progression with
3 as com-
mon difference, or
1,4, 7,...
! + (â€¢Â«,- 1)3,...;
and generally
(c. 11) the gnomons of polygonal numbers of a
sides are
1,
l + (a-2),
l + 2(a-2),... l+(r-l)(a-2),...
and the Â«-gonal number with side n is
l + l + (a-2) + l + 2(a-2) + ... + l+(w-l)(a,-2)
= n + ^n (n- 1) (a â€” 2)
The general formula
is not given by Nicomachus, who con-
tents himself with writing down
a certain number of poly-
gonal numbers of each species up to heptagons.
After mentioning
(c. 12) that any square
is the sum of two
successive triangular numbers, i.e.
n^ = ^{n-l)n + ^n{n+ 1),
and
that
an
a-gonal number
of
side n
is the sum
of
an
(aâ€” l)-gonal number
of side n plus a triangular number of
side nâ€”l,i.e.
n + ^n{nâ€”l) (aâ€” 2) = n + ^n{n- l){a-S)+^n{n-l),
he passes
(c. 1 3) to the
first solid number, the pyramid.
The
base of the pyramid may be a triangular, a square, or any
polygonal number.
If the base has the side n, the pyramid is
formed by
similar
and
similarly
situated
polygons
placed
successively upon
it, each of which has
1 less in its side than
that which precedes it
;
it ends of course in a unit at the top,
the
unit being
' potentially
' any polygonal number.
Nico-
machus mentions the first triangular pyramids as being
1,
4,
10,
20,
35, 56,
84, and
(c. 14) explains
the formation
of
the
series of pyramids with square bases, but he gives no general

NICOMACHUS
lOr
formula
or
summation.
An
a-gonal number with n
in
its
side being
it follows that the pyramid with that polygonal number for
base is
l+2 + 3 + ...+ii + |(a-2) {1.2 + 2.3 + ...+(7i-l)n}

A pyramid
is KoXovpos, truiicated, when the unit is cut off
the
top,
StKoXovpos, twice-truncated, when the unit and the
next layer is cut off, rpiKoXovpos, thrice-truncated, when three
layers are cut off, and so on
(c. 14).
Other solid numbers are then
classified
(cc. 15-17):
cubes,
which are the product of three equal numbers; scalene num-
bers, which are
the product
of
three numbers
all unequal,
and which are alternatively called
iveclges
(a-cprjvia-Koi), stakes
{cr(f)t}Ki(TKoi), or altars
{^co/xia-KOL).
The latter three names are
in
reality inappropriate
to mere products of three unequal
factors, since
the
figure which
could
properly be
called by
these names should taper,
i. e. should have the plane face at
the top less than the
base.
We shall find when we come to
the chapter on Heron's mensuration that true
(geometrical)
^mjjLia-KOL and (r<f)r]vi<TKoi have there to be measured in which
the top rectangular face is in fact smaller than the rectangular
base parallel to it.
lamblichus too indicates the true nature
of /SoD/iia-KOL and (KprjvicrKOL when he says that they have not
only their dimensions but also their faces and angles unequal,
and that, while the nXivOi? or Sokl^ corresponds to the paral-
lelogram, the
a-cprjfLa-Kos corresponds to the trapezium.^
The
use, therefore, of the terms in question as alternatives to scalene.
appears
to be due to a misapprehension.
Other varieties of
solid numbers
are

in which there are
faces

all of which formulae are easily verified.
Sum of series of cube numbers.
C. 20 ends with an interesting statement about cubes.
If,
says Nicomachus, we set out the series of odd numbers
1,
3,
5, 7,
9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19,
...
the
first
(1)
is a cube, the sum of the next ttvo
(3 + 5)
is a
cube, the sum of the next three (7 + 9 + 11) is a cube, and so on.
We can prove
this law by assuming that n^ is equal to the
sum
of n odd immbers
beginning with
2a:;+l and
ending
with
2a;+ 211â€”1.
The sum
is (2x+n)n;
since
therefore
(2 X + n) n = n^,
X = ^{n^-n),
and the formula is
in''â€” n+l) + {ii--n + 3) + ...+{n^ + n-l) = n^.
By putting successively n = 1,2,3
... r, &c., in this formula
and adding the results we find that
13 + 23 + 33+... +r3= i+(3 + 5)+(7 + 9 + ll) + ... + (... r^ + r-1).
The jiumber of terms in this series of odd numbers is clearly
1+2 + 3 +
.. .+r
or
|r(r+l).
Therefore
1'^ + 2^ + 3^ +
.
.
. + 1- = i r (r- + 1) (i + r^ + r - 1)

SUM OF SERIES OF CUBE NUMBERS
109
Nicomachus does not give this formula, but
it was known
to
the Roman
agrimensores,
and
it
would
be
strange
if
Nicomachus was not aware
of
it.
It may have been
dis-
covered by
the
same
mathematician who
found
out
the
proposition
actually stated by Nicomachus, which probably
belongs to a much
earlier time.
For the Greeks were from
the time of the
early Pythagoreans accustomed to summing
the series of odd numbers by placing
3,
5,
7, &c., successively
as gnomons round
1
;
they knew that the
result, whatever
the number of gnomons, was always a square, and that, if the
number of gnomons added to
1
is (say)
r, the sum (including
the
1)
is
(r+1)^.
Hence, when
it was once discovered that
the
first cube after
1,
i.e.
2^,
is
3 + 5, the
second, or
3^,
is
7 + 9 + 11, the third, or 4^ is 13 + 15 + 17 + 19, and so on, they
were
in
a
position
to sum
the
series
1^ + 2^ + 3*+ ... +r';
for it was only necessary to find out how many terms of the
series
1 + 3 + 5 +
.
.
. this sum of cubes includes.
The number
of
terms
being
clearly
1 + 2 + 3 +
.
.
. + r,
the
number
of
gnomons (including the
1
itself)
is ^r(r + l); hence the sum
of them all (including the
1), which is equal to
13 + 23 + 33+... +r^
is
{|r(r + l)}--
Fortunately we possess apiece of evidence
which makes
it
highly
probable
that
the
Greeks
actually
dealt with the problem in
this way.
Alkarkhi, the Arabian
algebraist
of
the
tenth-eleventh
century, wrote an
algebra
under the title Al-Fakhn.
It would seem that there were at
the time two schools in Arabia which were opposed
to one
another in that one favoured Greek, and
the
other Indian,
methods.
Alkarkhi was
one
of
those who
followed Greek
models almost exclusively, and he has a proof of the theorem
now in question by means of a figure with gnomons drawn
in
it,
furnishing an
excellent
example
of
the
geometrical
algebra which is so distinctively Greek.
Let ABhe the side of a square AC;
let
AB =
l + 2 + ...+n= ^n{n+l),
and suppose BB' = n, B'B" =n-l, B" B'" =n-2, and so on.
Draw
the
squares
on
AB', AB"...
forming
the gnomons
shown in the figure.

110
PYTHAGOREAN ARITHJIETIC
B
8'
B"
B'"

D'
Then the gnomon
BG'D^BB' .BG+DD'.G'B'
= BB'(BC+C"D').
Now BC = ^n(n+l),
G'D'^ l+2 + 3 + ... + (w-l) = ^n{n-l),
BB'=n;
therefore (gnomon BG'B) = n .n- = n^.
Similarly (gnomon B'G"D') â€”
(ii â€” 1)^, and so on.
Therefore 1^ + 2^ + ... +7i^ = the sum of the gnomons round
the small square at A which has
1 for its side flus that small
square
; that
is,
l3 + 23 + 33 + ... + n,3= square AG =
(l-n, (w+ l)}^.
It
is
easy
to
see
that
the
first gnomon about the small
square at
J. is
3 + 5 = 2^, the next gnomon is
7 + 9 + 11 =
3',
and so on.
The
demonstration
therefore
hangs
together
with
the
theorem stated by Nicomachus. Two alternatives are possible.
Alkarkhi may have devised the proof himself in the Greek
manner, following the hint supplied by Nicomaehus's theorem.
Or he may have found
the
whole
proof
set out
in
some
Greek treatise now lost and reproduced
it.
Whichever alter-
native is the true one, we can hardly doubt the Greek
origin
of the summation of the series of cubes.
Nicomachus passes to the theory of arithmetical proportion
and the various means
(cc. 21-9), a description of which has
already been given
(p. 87
above).
There
are
a few
more
propositions to be mentioned under this head.
If aâ€” 6 = 6â€” c,
so that
a,
b, c are in arithmetical progression, then
(c. 23. 6)
V- ~ac = {a-lf = {h-cf,

NICOMACHUS
111
a
fact which, according
to Nicomaehus, was
not
generally
known.
Boetius^ mentions
this
proposition
which,
if we
take a + d,
a, a â€” d as the three terms in arithmetical pro-
gression, may
be
written
a^ =
(a + d) (aâ€”d) + d^.
This
is
presumably the
origin
of the
regiila Nicomachi
quoted by
one Ocreatus
(? O'Creat), the author of a
tract, Prologus in
Helceph,
written
in
the
twelfth
or
thirteenth
century^
(' Helceph
'
or
' Helcep
'
is
evidently
equivalent
to
Algo-
risvius; may
it
perhaps
be
meant
for
the
Al-Kdfl
of
Alkarkhi?).
The
object
of the regula
is to find the square
of
a number
containing a
single
digit.
Ifd=lO â€” a,
or
a + d =
10, the rule is represented by the formula
a^= 10 {a-d) + d^,
so that the calculation of a^
is made to depend on that of
d'''
which is easier to evaluate if d<a.
Again
(c. 24.
3, 4),
if
a, h, c be three terms
in descending
geometrical progression, r being the common ratio (a/b or b/c),
then
aâ€” b _ a _b
â€¢
b â€” c ~ b ~ c
and
{a-b) = ir-l)b,
(b-c) = {r-l)c,
(a-6)-(6-c) = (r-l)(6-c).
It follows that
b = aâ€” b{râ€”\) = c + c (râ€” 1).
This
is the property
of
three
terms
in
geometrical
pro-
gression which
corresponds
to the property of three
terms
a,
&, c of a harmonical progression
a
c
b = a
r= c + -)
n
li
from which we derive
n = (a + c) / {aâ€”c).
If
a,
b,
c are
in
descending
order, Nicomaehus
observes
(c
25)
that
^ < = > -
according
as
a,
b,
c
are
in
arith-
metical, geometrical, or harmonical progression.

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
.The
' Platonic
theorem
'
(c.
24.
6)
about
the number
of
possible means
(geometric) between two square numbers and
between two
cube
numbers
respectively
has
already
been
mentioned
(pp.
89, 90), as also the 'most perfect proportion'
(p.
86).
Theon of Smyrna was the author
of a book purporting
to be a manual of mathematical subjects such as a student
would require to enable him to understand Plato.
A fuller
account of this work will be given later
;
at present we are
only concerned with the arithmetical portion.
This gives the
elementary theory
of numbers on much the same
lines
as
we
find
it
in Nicomachus, though
less
systematically.
We
can here pass over the things which are common to Theon
and Nicomachus and confine ourselves to what is peculiar to
the
former.
The
important
things
are two.
One
is
the
theory of side- and diameter-numbers invented by the Pytha-
goreans
for
the
purpose
of finding
the
successive
integral
solutions
of
the
equations
2x'^ â€” y^=+l;
as
to
this
see
pp. 91-3
above.
The other is an explanation of the limited
number of forms which square numbers may have.^
If m^ is
a square number, says Theon, either m,^ or m^â€” 1
is divisible
by
3, and again either m^ or m"^â€”!
is divisible by 4
: which
is equivalent to saying that a square number cannot be of
any of the following forms, 3n + 2, ^n + 2, in + 3.
Again, he
says, for any square number m^, one of the following alterna-
tives must hold

ARITHMETIC IN THEON OF SMYRNA

lamblichus states the same facts in a slightly different form.^
The truth
of these statements can be seen in the following
way.''
Since any number m must have one of the following
forms
Qk,
6/c+l,
6fc + 2,
6/0 + 3,
any square m^ must have one or other of the forms
SeP,
36/c2+12/(;+l,
36P + 24/C + 4,
36P + 36/i; + 9.
For squares of the
first type â€” and â€”
are both integral,
"Tl")/ â€” 1
7)7, â€” 1
for those of the second type â€”-â€”
> â€”--â€” are both integral,
in
~â€” 1
Qiv
for those of the third type â€” -â€” and
-â€”
are both
integral,
rt^-i 2
^"L
1
and
for those
of the
fourth
type â€”
â€¢
and
are
both
integral
;
which agrees with
Theon's
statement.
Again,
if
the four forms of squares be divided by
3
or 4, the remainder
is always either
or
1
;
so that, as Theon says, no square can
be
of
the form 3n+2,
4ii + 2, or 4w+3.
We can hardly
doubt that these discoveries were also Pythagorean.
Iamblichus, born at Chalcis in Coele-Syria, was a pupil of
Anatolius and Porphyry, and belongs to the first half of the
fourth century A. D. He wrote nine Books on the Pythagorean
Sect, the
titles of which were as follows
:
I. On the Life of
Pythagoras
;
II.

VI.
On

;
VII. On arithmetical

;
VIII. On
the Pythagorean geometry; IX. On the Pythagorean music.
The
first four
of
these
books survive and are

in
modem
editions
;
the other
five
are
lost,
though
extracts
from
VII.
are
doubtless
contained
in
the
Theologumena
arithmetices.
Book IV. on Nicomachus's Introductio
is that
which concerns us here
; and the few things requiring notice
are the following.
The first
is the view of a square number

1-1-2 + 3 + 4...
(''^-l) +
1+2 + 3 + 4. ..(w-2) + (7i-l)+
.
This is of course equivalent to the proposition that w^
is the
sum of the two triangular numbers i-n
(-n. + 1) and ^(nâ€”\)n
with
sides n and nâ€”\
respectively.
Similarly
lambliehus
points out ^ that the oblong number
n{n-l) =
(1 + 2 + 3 + ...+n) + (n-2 + n-3 + ... + 3 + 2).
He
observes
that
it was on
this
principle
that,
after
10,
which was
called
the
unit
of
the second course
(SiVTepai-
Sovfievr)
fMovdsi), the Pythagoreans regarded
100 = 10.10
as
the unit of the third course
{TpLcoSov/xei^ri
ixovds), 1000 = 10'
as the unit of the fourth
course
(TeTpooSov/ieft]
/xovas), and
so on,^ since
1 +2 + 3 + ... + 10 + 9 + 8 +
. ..+2 + 1 = 10. 10,
10 + 20 + 30 + ... + 100 + 90 + 80+
... + 20 + 10 = 10^
100 + 200 + 300 + ... + 1000 + 900 + ... + 200 +100 = 10*,
and so on.
lambliehus
sees herein
the
special virtue of 10
:
but
of course
the same
formulae would
hold
in any
scale
of notation
as well
as the
decimal.
In connexion with
this Pythagorean decimal terminology
lambliehus
gives
a
proposition
of
the
greatest
interest.*
Suppose we have any three consecutive numbers the greatest
of
which
is
divisible by
3.
Take
the
sum
of
the
three
numbers
;
this
will
consist
of
a
certain number
of
units,
a certain number of
tens, a certain number of hundreds, and
so on.
Now take the units in the said sum as they are, then
as many units as there are tens in the sum, as manjr units
as
there
are
hundreds,
and
so
on, and
add
all
the
units
so
obtained together
(i.e. add the digits
of
the sum expressed
in our decimal notation).

result, and
so
on.
Then,
says
lamblichus,
the final
result
will he the nwmher
6.
E.g. take the numbers
10,
11, 12; the
sum
is
33.
Add
the
digits, and
the
result
is
6.
Take
994, 995, 996
: the sum
is 2985
; the sum of the digits is 24
;
and the sum of the digits of 24
is again 6.
The truth of the
general proposition is seen in this way.^
Let
N = n.Q + lOn^^+l O'^n., +
...
be a number
written in
the decimal
notation.
Let
S(J^)
represent the sum of
its digits,
*S'(-^ (iV)
the sum of the digits
of S{A^) and so on.
Now
iV-*S(iV") = 9
{n., + ni\+nin^+
...},
whence
iV" = Si^f)
(mod.
9).
Similarly
S{]:f} = S^-^^
(mod. 9).
Let
/SC'-') (iT) = (SfCOiV
(mod. 9)
be the
last
possible
relation
of
this kind
;
S^^'^N will be a
number N' ^
9.
Adding the congruences, we obtain
i\^ = iV'
(mod.
9), while N' ^
9.
Now,
if we have
three consecutive numbers the greatest
of which is divisible by 3, we can put for their sum
X = {3p + 1) + (3p + 2) + (3 jj + 3) =
923 + 6,
and the above congruence becomes
9 jj + 6 = iV (mod.
9),
so that
iV = 6
(mod. 9)
;
and, since
A^' <
9, N' can only be equal to 6.
This addition
of the digits of a number expressed in our
notation
has
an
important
parallel
in
a
passage
of
the
Refutation of all Heresies by saint Hippolytus,^ where there
is
a
description
of
a method
of
foretelling
future
events
called
the
' Pythagorean
calculus
'.
Those,
he
says, who
claim to predict events by means of calculations with numbers,
letters and names use the
principle of the 23yth')nen or base,

PYTHAGOREAN ARITHMETIC
that
is, what we
call a
digit
of a number expressed in our
decimal notation
; for the Greeks, in the ease of any number
above
9, the pythme^i was the same number of units as the
alphabetical numeral contains
tens, hundreds, thousands, &c.
Thus the pythmen
of
700
(r/r
in Greek)
is
7
(()
;
that
of
^^
(6000)
is ^
(6), and
so
on.
The method then
proceeded
to
find
the pythmen
of
a
certain
name,
say
'Aya/j.i/J.vaiv.
Taking the pythmenes
of
all the
letters and adding them,
we have
1 + 3 + 1+4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 5 = 36.
Take the pythmenes
of
36, namely 3 and
6, and their sum
is
9.
The pythmen of
'Aya/iifxvcov
is therefore
9.
Next take
the name "EKTa>p; the pyythmenes are
5,
2, 3,
8,
1, the sum
of
which is
1 9
; the i^ythmenes of
1 9 are ,1,9; the sum of
1 and
9 is 10, the pythmen of which is
1.
The 2yythmen of "Ektcop
is therefore
1.
'It
is
easier', says
Hippolytus,
'to proceed
thus.
Finding the pyt'h')nenes of the letters, we obtain, in the
case of "EKTCop,
1 9 as their sum.
Divide this by 9 and note
the remainder
:
thus, if
I divide
19 by
9, the remainder
is
1,
for nine times
2
is
18, and
1
is
left, which will accordingly
be the pytlvmen of the name "EKTcop.'
Again, take the name
ndrpoKXos.
The sum of the p)ythm,enes is
8 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 7 + 2 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 34:
and
3 + 4 =
7,
so
that
7
is
the
p)ytliinen
of
HdrpoKXo^.
' Those then who calculate by the rule of nine take one-ninth
of the sum
of the pythmenes and then determine the sum of
the pyythmenes in the remainder.
Those on the
other hand
who follow the
" rule of seven " divide by
7.
Thus the sum
of the pythmenes in UaTpoKXos was found
to be
34.
This,
divided by 7, gives 4, and since 7 times 4 is 28, the remainder
is
6.
.
.
.'
' It
is
necessary
to
observe
that,
if the
division
gives
an
integral
quotient
(without
remainder),
.
.
.
the
pythmen is the number 9 itself
' (that is, if the rule of niTie
is
followed).
And so on.
Two things emerge from this fragment.
(1) The use of the
pythmen was not appearing for the first time when Apollonius
framed
his
system
for
expressing
and
multipljang
large
numbers
;
it originated much
earlier, with the Pythagoreans.

lAMBLICHUS
117
(2) The method of calculating the pythmen
is like the opera-
tion of
' casting out nines
'
in the proof which goes by that
name, where we take the sum of the digits of a number and
divide by 9 to get the remainder.
The method of verification
by
' casting out nines
' came to us from the Arabs, who may,
as Avicenna and Maximus Planudes tell
us, have got it from
the Indians
; but the above evidence shows that, at all events,
the elements from which
it was
built up lay ready to hand
in the Pythagorean arithmetic.

' Sunamary

already been
cited in
the preceding chapter.
Occupying a
few pages (65-70) of Proclus's Commentary on Euclid, Book I,
it reviews, in the briefest possible outline, the course of Greek
geometry from the earliest times to Euclid, with special refer-
ence
to the evolution of the Elements.
At one time
it was
often
called
the
' Eudemian summary ', on the assumption
that
it was an extract from the great History of Geometi-y in
four Books by Eudemus, the pupil of Aristotle.
But a perusal
of
the
summarj'
itself
is
sufficient
to show that
it cannot
have been written by Eudemus
; the most that can be said is
that, down
to a certain sentence,
it was probably based, more
or less
directly, upon data appearing in Eudemus's History.
At the sentence in question there is a break in the narrative,
as follows
' Those who have compiled histories bring the development
of
this
science up
to
this
point.
Not much younger than
these
is
Euclid, who put together
the
Elements,
collecting
many of the theorems of Eudoxus, perfecting many others by
Theaetetus, and bringing
to
irrefragable
demonstration
the
propositions which had only been somewhat loosely proved by
his predecessors.'
Since Euclid was later than Eudemus, it
is impossible that
Eudemus can have written
this
; while the description
' those
who have compiled
histories', and who by implication were
a little older than Euclid, suits Eudemus excellently.
Yet the
style
of
the summary
after the break does not show any
such change from
that of
the
earlier portion as
to suggest

THE 'SUMMARY' OF PROCLUS
119
different authorship.
The author of the
earlier portion fre-
quently refers to the question of the origin of the Elements of
Geometry in a way in which no one would be likely to write
who was not later than Euclid
; and
it seems to be the same
hand which, in the second
portion, connects the Elements of
Euclid with the work
of Eudoxus and Theaetetus.
Indeed
the author, whoever he was, seems to have compiled the sum-
mary with one main object in view, namely, to trace the origin
and growth
of the Elements of Geometry;
consequently he
omits to refer to certain famous discoveries
in geometry such
as the solutions of the problem of the duplication of the cube,
doubtless because they did not belong to the Elements.
In
two cases he alludes
. to such discoveries, as
it were in paren-
thesis, in order to recall to the mind of the reader a current
association of the name of a particular geometer with a par-
ticular discovery.
Thus he mentions Hippocrates of Chios as
a famous geometer for the particular reason that he was the
first to write Elements, and he adds to his name, for the pur-
pose of identification,
' the discoverer of the quadrature of the
lune
'.
Similarly, when he says
of Pythagoras
' (he
it was)
who
'
(oy
Sfj
.
.
.)
' discovered
the
theory
of
irrationals
[or
" proportions "] and the construction of the cosmic figures
',
he
seems
to be alluding, entirely on
his own
account,
to a
popular tradition to that eflect.
If the summary is the work
of one author, who was
it ?
Tannery answers that
it was
Geminus
; but this seems highly improbable, for the extracts
from
Geminus's work which we
possess
suggest
that
the
subjects therein discussed were of a different kind
; they seem
rather to have been general questions relating to the philoso-
phy and content of mathematics, and even Tannery admits
that
historical details could only have come incidentally into
the work.
Could the author have been Proclus himself ?
This again
seems, on the whole, improbable.
In favour of the authorship
of Proclus are the facts
(1) that the question of the origin of
the Elements is kept prominent and
(2) that there is no men-
tion of Democritus, whom Eudemus would not have ignored,
while a follower of Plato such
as
Proclus might have done
him this injustice, following the example of Plato himself, -vyho
was an opponent of Democritus, never once mentions him, aud

THALES
is said to have wished to burn all his writings.
On the other
hand
(1) the style of
the summary
is not such
as to point
to Proclus as the
author;
(2)
if he wrote
it,
it
is hardly
conceivable that he would have passed over in silence the dis-
covery of the analytical method,
' the finest
', as he says else-
where, of the traditional methods in geometry,
' which Plato is
said
to
have
communicated
to Laodamas'.
Nor
(3)
is
it
easy
to
suppose
that
Proclus
would
have
spoken in
the
detached way that the author does of Euclid whose Elements
was the subject of his whole commentary
:
' Not much younger
than these is Euchd, who compiled the Elements
.
.
.
'.
' This
man lived in the time of the first Ptolemy
.
.
.'. On the whole,
therefore, it would seem probable that the body of the sum-
mary was taken by Proclus from a compendium made by some
writer
later than Eudemus, though the
earlier
portion was
based, directly or indirectly, upon notices in Eudemus's History.
But the prelude with which the summary is introduced may
well have been written, or at
all events expanded, by Proclus
himself,
for
it
is
in
his manner
to bring in
' the
inspired
Aristotle' (o SaL/xovLos 'ApinTOTeX-qs)â€” as he calls him here and
elsewhereâ€”and the transition to
the story of the Egyptian
origin of geometry may also be his
' Since, then, we have to consider the beginnings of the arts
and
sciences with reference
to the
particular cycle
[of
the
series postulated by Aristotle] through which the universe is
at present passing, we say that, according
to most accounts,
geometry was first discovered in Egypt, having had its origin
in the measurement of areas.
For this was a necessity for the
Egyptians owing to the rising of the Nile which
efl'aced the
proper boundaries of everybody's lands.'
The next sentences also may well be due to Proclus
' And it is in no way surprising that the discovery of this as
well as the other sciences had
its beginning in practical needs,
seeing that everything that
is in the course of becoming pro-
gresses from the imperfect to the perfect.
Thus the transition
from
sensation
to
reasoning and from reasoning
to under-
standing is only natural.'
These sentences look
like
reflections by
Proclus, and
the
transition to the summary proper follows, in the words
:
'Accordingly,
just
as
exact
arithmetic began among
the

Phoenicians owing
to
its use in commerce and contracts, so
geometry was discovered in Egypt for the reason aforesaid.'
Tradition
as
to the origin
of geometry.
Many Greek writers besides Proclus give a similar account
of
the
origin
of geometry.
Herodotus
says
that
Sesostris
(Ramses II, circa 1300 B.C.) distributed the land among all the
'^gyptiS'iis in equal rectangular
plots, on which he levied an
annual tax
; when therefore the river swept away a portion
of a plot and the owner applied for a corresponding reduction
in the tax, surveyors had to be sent down to certify what the
reduction in the area had been.
' This, in my opinion {BokUi
fj-oi)', he continues, 'was the
origin of geometry, which then
passed into Greece.' ^
The same
story, a
Uttle amplified,
is
repeated by other
writers, HerOn
of
Alexandria,^ Diodorus
Siculus,^ and Strabo.*
True, all these statements (even if that
,
in
Proclus
was
taken
directly from Eudemus's History
of
Geometry) may all be founded on the passage of Herodotus,
and Herodotus may have stated as his own inference what he
was told in Egypt
;
for
Diodorus
gives
it
as an Egyptian
tradition that geometry and astronomy were the discoveries
of Egypt, and, says that the Egyptian priests claimed Solon,
Pythagoras,
Plato,
Democritus,
Oenopides
of
Chios,
and
Eudoxus
as
their
pupils.
But
the Egyptian
claim
to
the
discoveries was
never
disputed by the
Greeks.
In
Plato's
Phaedrus Socrates is made to say that he had heard that the
Egyptian god Theuth was the
first to invent arithmetic, the
science of calculation, geometry, and astronomy .'
Similarly
Aristotle says that the mathematical arts first took shape in
Egypt, though he gives as the reason, not the practical need
which arose for a scientific method of measuring land, but the
fact that in Egypt there was a leisured class, the priests, who
could spare time for such things.^
Democritus boasted that no
one of his time had excelled him
' in making lines into figm-es
and proving their properties, not even the
so-called Harpe-
donaptae in Egypt '.'
This word, compounded of two Greek
words, apireSovT) and airnLv, means

and, while
it
is
clear from the passage that the
persons referred to were clever geometers, the word reveals a
characteristic modus
operandi.
The
Egyptians
were
ex-
tremely careful about
the
orientation of
their
temples, and
the
use
of
ropes and
pegs
for marking
out
the
limits,
e.g.
corners,
of
the
sacred
precincts
is
portrayed
in
all
pictures of the laying of foundation stones of temples.^
The
operation of
' rope-stretching
' is mentioned in an inscription on
leather in the Berlin Museum as having been in use as early
as Amenemhat
I (say 2300
B.C.).^
Now
it was the practice
of
ancient Indian and
probably also
of Chinese
geometers
to make,
for
instance,
a
right angle by
stretching a
rope
divided into three lengths in the ratio of the sides of a right-
angled triangle in rational numbers, e.g. 3, 4, 5, in such a way
that the three portions formed a triangle, when of course a right
angle would be formed at the point where the two smaller
sides meet.
There seems to be no doubt that the Egyptians
knew that
the
triangle
(3,
4, 5), the
sides
of which
are
so
related that the square on the greatest
side
is equal to the
sum of the squares on the other two, is right-angled
;
if this
is
so, they were
acquainted with
at
least one
case
of
the
famous proposition of Pythagoras.
Egyptian geometry,
i. e. mensuration.
We
might
suppose,
from
Aristotle's
remark
about
the
Egyptian
priests
being
the
first
to
cultivate mathematics
because
they had
leisure,
that
their geometry would
have
advanced beyond
the
purely
practical
stage
to something
more
like a theory or science
of geometry.
But the docu-
ments which have survived do not give any ground for this
supposition
; the art of geometry in the hands of the priests
never seems
to have advanced beyond mere
routine.
The
most important available source of information about Egyptian
mathematics
is the Papyrus Rhind, written probably about
1700
B.C.
but copied from an original
of the time
of King
Amenemhat III
(Twelfth Dynasty), say 2200 B.C.

difficulties
',
as
it
calls
itself,
is
rough
meibsuration.
The
following
are
the
cases
dealt with which
concern us
here.
(1) There
is
the
rectangle, the
area of which
is
of
course
obtained by multiplying together the numbers
representing
the sides.
(2) The measure of a triangle is given as the pro-
duct of half the base into the side.
And here there is a ditier-
ence of opinion as to the kind of triangle measured.
Eisenlohr
and Cantor, taking the diagram to represent an isosceles tri-
angle rather
inaccurately drawn, have to assume
error on
the part of the writer in making the
area ^ah
instead
of
^aV(b'^ â€” ^a'^) where a is the base and h the 'side', an error
which
of course becomes
less
serious
as a becomes
smaller
relatively to h (in the ease taken a =
4,
?> = 10, and the area
as given according to the rule, i.e. 20, is not greatly different
from the true value 19-5959).
But other authorities take the
triangle to be right-angled and h to be the side perpendicular
to the base, their argument being that the triangle as drawn
is not a worse representation of a right-angled triangle than
other triangles purporting to be right-angled which are found
in other manuscripts, and indeed
is a better representation of
a right-angled triangle than it is of an isosceles triangle, while
the number representing the side is shown in the iigure along-
side one only of the
sides, namely that adjacent to the angle
which the more nearly represents a right angle.
The advan-
tage
of this interpretation
is
that
the
rule
is
then correct
instead of being more inaccurate than one would expect from
a people who had expert land surveyors to measure land for
the purpose
of
assessing
it
to
tax.
The same doubt
arises
with reference to (3) the formula for the area of a trapezium,
namely |(Â« -f- c) x 6, where
a, c are the base and the opposite
parallel
side
respectively, while h is the
' side
', i.e. one of the
non-parallel sides.
In this case the figure seems to have been
intended to be isosceles, whereas the formula is only accurate
if b, one of the non-parallel sides, is at right angles to the base,
in which case of course the side opposite to b is not^ at right
angles to the base.
As the
parallel
sides
(6, 4) in the case
taken are short relatively to the
' side
' (20), the angles at the
base are not far short of being right angles, and
it is possible
that one of them, adjacent
to the
particular
side which
is
marked
20, was intended to be right.
The hypothesis that

124
THE EARLIEST GREEK GEOMETRY.
THALES
the triangles and trapezia are isosceles, and that the formulae
are therefore crude and
inaccurate, was thought
to be
con-
firmed by the evidence of inscriptions on the Temple of Horus
at Edfu.
This temple was planned out in 237 B.C.; the in-
scriptions which refer to the assignment of plots of ground to
the priests belong
to the reign of Ptolemy XI, Alexander I
(107-88
B.C.).
From
so much of these inscriptions as were
published by Lepsius^ we gather that ^(a + c) .^(b + d) was a
formula for the area of a quadrilateral the sides of which in
order
are
Â«,
b,
c,
d.
Some
of
the quadrilateral figures
are
evidently trapezia with the non-parallel sides equal
; others are
not, although they are commonly not far from being rectangles
or isosceles trapezia.
Examples are
' 16 to 15 and 4 to 3|- make
58|' (i.e.i(16 + 15)xi(4 + 3|) = 58|);
' 9i to 10| and 24i | to
22i i make 236^
'
;
'22
to 23 and 4 to
4 make 90 ', and so on.
Triangles are not made the subject of a separate formula, but
are regarded as cases of quadrilaterals in which the length of
one side is zero.
Thus the triangle
5, 17, 17 is described as a
figure with sides
'
to 5 and 17 to 17
', the area being accord-
ingly 1(0 + 5)
. -1(1 7 -h 1 7) or 42i
;
is expressed by hieroglyphs
meaning the word Nen.
It is remarkable enough that the use
of a formula so inaccurate should have lasted till 200 years or
so after Euclid had lived and taught in Egypt ; there is also
a case of its use in the Liber Gee^Mnicus formerly attributed to
Heron,^ the quadrilateral having two opposite
sides
parallel
and the pairs of opposite sides being (32, 30) and (18, 16).
But
it
is right to add
that, in the
rest of the Edfu inscriptions
published later by Brugsch, there are cases where the inaccu-
rate formula is not used, and it is suggested that what is being
attempted in these cases
is an approximation to the square
root of a non-square number."
We come now
(4)
to the mensuration of
circles as found
in
the Papyrus Rhind.
If d

the
diameter,
the area

given as

heaps of grain or
oi' spaces which they
fill.
Unfortunately
the shape of these spaces or heaps cannot be determined with
certainty.
The word in
the Papyrus Rhind
is shaa;
it
is
evident that it ordinarily means a rectangular parallelepiped,
but
it can
also be applied to a figure with a circular base,
e.g. a
cylinder, or a figure
resembling a thimble,
i.e. with
a rounded
top.
There
is a measurement of a mass of corn
apparently of the
latter sort in
one of
the Kahun
papyri.^
The
figure shows a
circle with 1365i as the content
of the
heap written within
it, and with 12 and 8 written above and
to the left of the circle respectively.
The calculation is done
in this way.
12
is taken and ^ of
it added;
this gives
16;
16 is squared, which gives
256, and finally 256
is multiplied
by I
of
8, which gives
1365A.
If
for the original figures
12 and 8 we write A and k respective^, the formula used for
the content
is {%hf.%k.
Griffith took
12
to be the height
of
the
figure and
8
to be
the diameter
of the
base.
But
according to another interpretation,^
12
is simply f of
8, and
the
figure
to
be measured
is
a hemisphere
with
diameter
8
ells.
If
this
is
so,
the formula makes the content
of a
hemisphere
of
diameter k
to be
(f .f /c) ^.|A; or
ffc^.
Com-
paring this with the true volume of the hemisphere, f
. ^-ir/c^
or
Yz'^'^'^^ = 134.041
cubic
ells, we
see that the
result
1365-|
obtained by the formula must be expressed in ^-Qths of a cubic
ell: consequently for
-^^t: the formula substitutes
-5%, so that
the formula gives 3-2 in place of
-n, a value diff'erent from the
3-16 of Ahmes.
Borchardt suggests that the formula for the
measurement of a hemisphere was got by repeated practical
measurements of heaps of corn built up as nearly as possible
in that form, in which case the inaccuracy in the figure for
tt
is not surprising.
With this problem from the Kahun papyri
must be compared No. 43 from the Papyrus Rhind. A curious
feature in the
measurements
of
stores or heaps of corn in
the Papyrus Rhind
is the
fact, not as yet satisfactorily ex-
plained, that the area of the base (square or circular) is first
found and is then regularly multiplied, not into the
' height
itself, but into f times the height.
But in No. 43 the calcula-
tion is diff'erent and more parallel to the case in the Kahun
papyrus.
The problenj is to find the content of a space round

The word qa, here
translated
' height ',
is
apparently used in
other documents
for
' length
' or
' greatest dimension
', and must in this case
mean
the
diameter of the
base, while the
' breadth
'
is the
height in our sense.
If we denote the diameter of the circular
base by
k, and
the
height by
h,
the formula used in this
problem
for finding the volume
is
(f
â€¢ f/i')^- f ^-
Here
it
is
not
f A,
but f A., which
is taken
as the
last
factor
of
the
product.
Eisenlohr suggests that the analogy of the formula
for a hemisphere, nr^.Â§r, may have operated
to make
the
calculator take |
of the
height, although the height
is not
in the particular case the same as the radius of the base, but
different.
But
there remains
the
difficulty that
(f)^ or
-^^^-
times
the
area of the
circle
of diameter k
is taken instead
of the area itself.
As to this Eisenlohr can only suggest that
the circle of diameter k -which was accessible for measurement
was not the real or mean circular section, and that allowance
had to be made for this, or that the base was not a
circle of
diameter k but an ellipse with
^^- k and k as major and minor
axes.
But such
explanations
can hardly be applied
to the
factor
(1)^ in the Kahun case if the latter
is really the case
of a hemispherical space
as
suggested.
Whatever the
true
explanation may
be,
it
is clear that these rules of measure-
ment must have been empirical and that there was
little or
no geometry about them.
Much more important geometrically are certain calculations
with reference to the proportions of pyramids (Nos. 66-9
of
the Papyrus Rhind) and a monu-

called

that

In the case or the monument we have
piremus
two other names for lines in the figure, (1) senti,
' foundation

or
base,
(2)
qay en
heru,
'vertical
length', or height; the
same term
se-qet
is used
for
the
relation â€”-â€”'â€”,
or
qay en heru,
the
same
inverted.
Eisenlohr
and
Cantor took
the
lines
(1) and
(2)
in the case
of the pyramid to be different from
the lines (1) and (2) called by different names in the monument.
Suppose A BCD
to be the square base of a pyramid, E
its
centre, H the vertex, and i^the middle point of the side AD
of the
base.
According to Eisenlohr and Cantor the iikha-
thebt
is the diagonal, say AC, of the base, and the pir-em-us
is the edge, as AH.
On this assumption the se-qet
=
, â€ž = cos HAE.
Â«
AH
In the case of the monument they took the senti
to be the
side of the base, as AB, the qay en heru to be the height of
the pyramid EH, and the
se-qet to be the
ratio
of EH to
^AB
or
of EH
to EF,
i.e. the tangent of the angle HFE
which
is the
slope
of the faces of the pyramid.
According
to Eisenlohr and Cantor, therefore, the one term
se-qet was
used in two different senses, namely, in Nos. 56â€”9 for cos HAE
and in No. 60 for tan HFE.
, Borchardt has, however, proved
that the se-qet in all the cases has one meaning, and represents
the
cotangent
of
the
slope
of
the
faces
of
the
pyramid,
i. e. cot HFE or the ratio of FE to EH.
There is no difficulty
in
the
use
of
the
different words
ukha-thebt and
senti
to
express
the same
thing, namely, the
side
of
the
base, and
of the different words per-em-us and qay en heru in the same
sense of
' height
'
; such synonyms are common in Egypt, and,
moreover, the word mer used
of
the pyramids
is
different
from the word an for the monument.
Again, it is clear that,
while the
slope, the angle HFE.,

But, lastly, the
se-qet in No. 56
is ff and,
if
se-qet
is taken
in the sense of
coi HFE,
this gives for the angle
HFE
the
value
of
54Â° 14' 16", which
is
precisely,
to
the

the
slope
of
the
lower
half
of

pyramid

Nos. 57-9
the
se-qet,
f,
is the
co-
tangent of an angle of 53Â° 7' 48", which again is exactly the
slope of the second pyramid of Gizeh as measured by Flinders
Petrie
; and the
se-qet
in No. 60, which
is

of an angle of
75Â° 57' 50", corresponding exactly to the slope
of
the
Mastaba-tombs
of
the Ancient Empire and
of
the
sides of the Medum pyramid.^
These measurements of
se-qet indicate at
all events a rule-
of-thumb use of geometrical proportion, and connect themselves
naturally enough with the story of Thales's method of measuring
the heights of pyramids.
The beginnings of Greek geometry.
At the beginning of the summary of Proclus we are
told
that Thales (624-547 B. C.)
'first
went
to
Egypt
and
thence
introduced
this
study
(geometry)
into
Greece.
He
discovered many
propositions
himself, and instructed his successors in the principles under-
lying many others, his method of attack being in some cases
more
general
(i.e. more
theoretical
or
scientific),
in
others
more empirical {alaO-qvLKcoTipov, more in the nature of simple
inspection or observation).' ^
With Thales, therefore, geometry first becomes a deductive
science depending on
general propositions;
this agrees with
what Plutarch says of him as one of the Seven Wise Men
'he
was
apparently
the
only one
of
these
whose
wisdom
stepped, in speculation, beyond the limits of practical utility
the rest acquired the reputation of wisdom in politics.' ^
(Not that Thales was
inferior
to
the
others
in
political
wisdom.
Two
stories
illustrate
the
contrary.
He
tried
to
save Ionia by urging the separate states to form a federation

with a capital at Teos, that being the most central place in
Ionia.
And when Croesus sent envoys to Miletus to propose
an alliance, Thales dissuaded his fellow-citizens from accepting
the proposal, with the result that, when Cyrus conquered, the
city was saved.)
(a)
Measurement of height of pyramid.
The accounts of Thales's method of measuring the heights
of pyramids vary.
The
earliest and simplest version is that
of
Hieronymus,
a
pupil
of
Aristotle,
quoted by
Diogenes
Laertius
:
' Hieronymus says that he even succeeded in measuring the
pyramids by observation
of
the
length
of
their shadow
at
the moment when our shadows are equal to our own height.' ^
Pliny says that
' Thales
discovered how
to
obtain
the
height
of
pyramids
and
all
other
similar
objects,
namely,
by
measuring
the
shadow of the object at the time when a body and its shadow
are equal in length.' ^
Plutarch
embellishes the story by making Niloxenus
say
*
to Thales
:
' Among other feats of yours, he (Amasis) was particularly
pleased with your measurement of the pyramid, when, without
trouble or the
assistance of any instrument, you merely set
up
a
stick
at
the
extremity
of
the
shadow
cast
by
the
pyramid and, having thus made two triangles by the impact
of the
sun's
rays, you showed that the pyramid has
to the
stick the same ratio which the shadow has to the shadow.' ^
The first of these versions is evidently the original one and,
as the procedure assumed in
it
is more elementary than the
more general method indicated by Plutarch, the
first version
seems to be the more probable.
Thales could not have failed
to observe that, at the time when the shadow of a particular
object
is equal to
its height, the same relation holds for
all
other
objects
casting
a
shadow
;
this
he would
probably
infer by
induction, after making actual measurements in a

THALES
considerable number of cases
at a time when he found the
length of the shadow of one object to be equal to its height.
But, even
if Thales used the more general method indicated
by Plutarch, that method does not, any more than the Egyptian
se-qet calculations, imply any general theory
of similar
tri-
angles or proportions
; the solution is itself a se-qet calculation,
just like that in No. 57
of Ahmes's handbook.
In the
latter
problem the base and the
se-qet are given, and we have
to
find
the
height.
So
in
Thales's problem we get
a
certain
se-qet by dividing the measured length of the shadow of the
stick by the length
of the
stick itself
; we then only require
to know the distance between the point of the shadow corre-
sponding
to the apex of the pyramid and the centre
of the
base
of the pyramid
in order
to determine the height;
the
only difficulty would be to measure or estimate the distance
from the apex of the shadow to the centre of the base.

Geometrical theorems uMributed
to
Thales.
The
following
are
the
general
theorems
in
elementary
geometry attributed to Thales.
(1) He
is
said to have been the
first
to demonstrate that
a circle is bisected by its diameter.^
(2) Tradition credited him with the
first statement of the
theorem
(Eucl.
I.
5)
that
the
angles
at
the
base
of
any
isosceles triangle are equal, although he used the more archaic
term
' similar
' instead of
' equal '.^
(3) The proposition (Eucl.
I. 15) that,
if two straight lines
cut one another, the
vertical and opposite
angles are equal
was discovered, though not
scientifically proved, by Thales.
Eudemus is quoted as the authority for this.^
(4) Eudemus in his History of Geometry referred to Thales
the theorem
of
Eucl.
I.
26
that,
if two
triangles have two
angles and one side respectively equal, the triangles are equal
in all respects.
' For he (Eudemus) says that the method by which Thales
showed how
to
find the
distances
of
ships from the shore
necessarily involves the use of this theorem.' *

GEOMETRICAL THEOREMS
131
(5)
' Pamphile says that Thales, who learnt geometry from
the Egyptians, was the first to describe on a circle a triangle
(which shall be) right-angled (Karaypdyp-ai kvkXov to rpiya>vov
6p6oya)viov), and that he
sacrificed an ox (on the strength of
the
discovery).
Others, however, including ApoUodorus the
calculator, say that it was Pythagoras.'
^
The natural interpretation of Pauiphile's words is to suppose
that she attributed
to Thales
the
discovery
that
the angle
in a semicircle is a right anwle.
Taking these propositions in order, we may observe
that,
when Thales
is said tg have
' demonstrated
'
(dnoSii^ai) that
a circle
is bisected by
its diameter, whereas he only
' stated
the theorem about
the
isosceles
triangle
and
' discovered
',
without
scientifically
proving,
the
equality
of
vertically
opposite angles, the word
' demonstrated
' must not be taken
too literally.
Even Euclid did not
' demonstrate
' that a circle
is
bisected by
its
diameter, but merely
stated
the
fact
in
I.
Def.
17,
Thales
therefore
probably
observed rather than proved the property
;
and
it may,
as Cantor
says,
have
been
suggested
by
the
appearance
of
certain
figures of
circles divided
into
a number
of equal
sectors by
2,
4, or
6 diameters
such
as
are
found
on
Egyptian monu-
ments or represented on
vessels brought
by
Asiatic
tributary
kings
in
the
time
of
the
eighteenth
dynasty.^
It has been suggested that the use of the word
' similar
' to
describe the equal angles of an isosceles triangle indicates that
Thales did not yet conceive of an angle as a magnitude, but
as a figure having a certain shape, a view which would agree
closely
with
the
idea
of
the Egyptian
ae-qet,
'that
which
makes the nature', in the sense of determining a similar or
the same inclination in the faces of pyramids.
With regard to
(4), the theorem
of
Eucl.
I.
26,
it
will be
observed that Eudemus only inferred that this theorem was
known to Thales from the fact that it is necessary to Thales's
determination
of
the
distance
of
a
ship
from
the
shore.
Unfortunately
the
method
used
can
only
be
conjectured.

THE EARLIEST GREEK GEOMETRY.
THALES
The most usual supposition is that Thales, observing the ship
from the top of a tower on the sea-shore, used the
practical
equivalent of the proportionality of the sides of two similar
right-angled
triangles, one small and one large.
Suppose B
to be the base of the tower, C the ship.
It was only necessary
for a man standing at the top of the
tower
to have an instrument
with
two
legs forming a
right
angle,
to
place it with one leg DA vertical and
in a
straight
line
with
B, and
the
other leg DE in the direction of the
ship,
to take any
point A on DA,
and then to mark on DE the point E
where the line of sight from ^
to C cuts the leg DE.
Then
AD (=
I, say) and DE {= m, say) can be actually measured,
as also the height BD (= h, say) from D
to the foot of the
tower, and, by similar triangles.
BC= (h + l).
I
The
objection
to
this
solution
is
that
it
does
not
depend
directly on Eucl.
I. 26, as Eudemus impKes.
Tannery ^ there-
fore favours the hypothesis of a solution on the lines followed
by
the Roman
agrimensor
Marcus
Junius
Nipsus
in
his
fiiiminis varatio.â€” To
find the distance from
A to an inaccessible point B.
Measure from A,
along a
straight
line at right angles to AB,
a distance AC, and bisect it at D.
From G, on
the
side oi AC remote from
B, draw CE at
right angles to AC, and let E be the point on
it which
is in a straight line with B and D.
Then
clearly, by
Eucl.
I.
26, GE is equal
to
AB;
and CE can be measured, so that AB
is known.
This hypothesis is open to a different objec-
tion,
namely
that,
as
a
rule,
it
would
be
difficult, in the supposed
case, to get a
sufficient amount
of
free and level space for the construction and measurements.
I have
elsewhere 2 suggested a
still
simpler method

from this objection, and depending equally directly on Eucl.
I- 26.
If the observer was placed on the top of a tower, he
had only to use a rough instrument made of a straight stick
and a cross-piece fastened to it so as to be capable of turning
about the fastening (say a
nail)
so that
it
could form any
angle with
the
stick and would remain where
it was
put.
Then the natural thing would be to fix the stick upright (by
means of a plumb-line) and direct the cross-piece towards the
ship.
Next,
leaving
the
cross-piece
at
the angle
so, found,
he would turn the stick round, while keeping it vertical, until
the
cross-piece pointed to some
visible
object on the
shore,
which would
be
mentally
noted;
after
this
it would only
be necessary to measure the distance of
the object from the
foot
of the tower, which distance would, by
Eucl.
I.
26,
be
equal to the distance of the ship.
It appears that this precise
method is found in so many practical geometries of the
first
century
of printing
that
it must be assumed
to have long
been a common
expedient.
There
is
a
story
that
one
of
Napoleon's
engineers won
the
Imperial
favour by
quickly
measuring, in precisely this way, the width of a stream that
blocked the progress of the army.'
There is even more difficulty about the dictum of Pamphile
implying that Thales
first discovered the fact that the angle
in a semicircle is a right angle.
Pamphile lived in the reign
of Nero
(a. d. 54-68), and is therefore a late authority.
The
date of Apollodorus the
'calculator' or arithmetician
is not
known, but he is given as only one of several authorities who
attributed the proposition to Pythagoras.
Again, the story
of
the
sacrifice
of an ox by Thales on the occasion of
his
discovery
is
suspiciously
like
that
told
in
the
distich
of
Apollodorus
' when Pythagoras discovered that famous pro-
position,
on
the
strength
of which
he
offered
a
splendid
sacrifice of oxen
'.
But, in quoting the distich of Apollodorus,
Plutarch expresses doubt whether the discovery so celebrated
was that of the theorem of the square
of the hypotenuse or
the solution of the problem of
' application of areas ' ^
; there
is nothing about the discovery of
the
fact
of the angle
in
a
semicircle being a right angle.
It may therefore
be that

THALE8
Dioo-enes Laertius was mistaken in bringing Apollodorus into
the
story now
in question
at
all
; the mere mention of the
sacrifice in Pamphile's account would naturally recall Apollo-
dorus's
lines
about
Pythagoras,
and
Diogenes
may
have
forgotten that they referred to a different proposition.
But, even
if the
story of Pamphile
is accepted, there are
difficulties of substance.
As Allman pointed
out,
if
Thales
knew
that
the
angle
in a
semicircle
is a right angle, he was in a position
at once to infer that the sum
of the
angles of any rigid-angled triangle
is
equal to two right angles.
For suppose
that BG
is the diameter of the semi-
circle,
the centre, and A a point on
the
semicircle
; we are then supposed
to know that the angle BAG is a right angle.
Joining OA,
we
form
two
isosceles
triangles
OAB, OAG:
and
Thales
knows
that
the
base
angles
in
each
of these
triangles are
equal.
Consequently the sum
of
the angles OAB, OAG
is
equal to the sum of the angles OBA, OCA.
The former sum
is known
to be a right angle
;
therefore the second sum
is
also a right angle, and the three angles of the triangle ABC
are
together equal to twice the
said sum,
i. e^
to two right
angles.
Next
it
would
easily
be
seen
that any
triangle
can
be
divided into two right-angled triangles bj- drawing a perpen-
dicular AD
from
a
vertex A
to
the
opposite
side
BC.
Then
the
three
angles
of
each
of
the
right-angled
triangles ABD, ADG are together equal
to two right angles. By adding together
the three angles
of both
triangles we
find that the sum
of the three angles
of
the
triangle ABC
together with the angles ABB, ABC
is equal
to
four right
angles;
and,
the sum
of
the
latter
two
angles
being two
right angles,
it follows that the sum of the remaining ano-les,
the angles at J, B, G, is equal to two right angles.
And ABC
is any triangle.
Now Euclid in III. 31 proves that the angle in,^a semicircle
is
a
right angle by means of the general theorem
of
I.
32

THE ANGLE IN A SEMICIRCLE
135
that the sum
of the angles of any triangle
is equal to two
right angles;
but
if Thales was aware
of the truth
of the
latter general proposition and proved the proposition about
the semicircle in this way, by means of
it, how did Eudemus
come to credit the Pythagoreans, not only with the general
proof, but with the discovery, of the theorem that the angles
of any triangle are together equal to two right angles 1 ^
Cantor, who supposes that Thales proved
his
proposition
after the manner of Euclid III. 31, i.e. by means of the general
theorem of
I. 32, suggests that Thales arrived at the truth of
the
latter,
not by a general
proof
like that
attributed by
Eudemus to the Pythagoreans, but by an argument following
the steps indicated hy Geminus.
Geminus says that
'the
ancients
investigated
the
theorem
of
the
two
right
angles in each individual species of triangle, first in the equi-
lateral, then
in the
isosceles, and afterwards
in the
scalene
triangle, but later geometers demonstrated the general theorem
that in any triangle the three interior angles are equal to two
right angles '.^
The
' later geometers
' being the Pythagoreans, it is assumed
that
the
' ancients
' may be Thales and
his
contemporaries.
As regards the equilateral triangle, the fact might be suggested
by the observation that six such triangles arranged round one
point as common vertex would
fill up the space round that
point
; whence
it follows that each angle
is one-sixth of four
right angles, and three such angles make up two right angles.
Again, suppose that
in
either an
equilateral
or an
isosceles
triangle the vertical angle is bisected by a straight line meet-
ing the base, and that the rectangle of which the bisector and
one
half
of
the base
are adjacent
sides
is
completed
;
the
rectangle is double of the half of the original triangle, and the
angles of the half-triangle are together equal to half the sum

THE EARLIEST GREEK GEOMETRY.
THALES
of
the angles
of the
rectangle,
i.e.
are
equal
to two
right
angles
; and it immediately follows that the sum of the angles
of the original equilateral or isosceles triangle
is equal to two
right angles.
The same thing is easily proved of any triangle
by dividing
it
into two
right-angled
triangles and completing the rectangles
which are their doubles respectively, as
in the figure.
But the fact that a proof
on these lines is just as easy inthe case
of the general triangle as
it
is for the
equilateral and isosceles triangles throwe doubt on the whole
procedure
; and we are
led to question whether there
is any
foundation for Geminus's account at
all.
Aristotle has a re-
mark that
'even
if one should prove, with
reference
to each
(sort
of)
triangle, the equilateral, scalene, and isosceles, separately, that
each has
its angles equal to two right angles, either by one
proof or by different
proofs, he does not yet know that
the
triangle,
i.e. the
triangle in general, has
its angles equal to
two right angles, except in a
sophistical
sense, even though
there
exists no
triangle
other than
triangles
of
the
kinds
mentioned.
For he knows
it not qua triangle, nor of every
triangle, except in a numerical
sense
; he does not know
it
notionally of every triangle, even though there be actually no
triangle which he does not know '}
It may well be that Geminus was misled
into taking
for
a
historical
fact what Aristotle gives only as a hypothetical
illustration, and that the exact stages by which the proposi-
tion was first proved were not those indicated by Geminus.
Could
Thales have
arrived
at
his
proposition about the
semicircle without assuming, or even knowing, that the sum
of the angles of any triangle is equal to two right angles ?
It
seems possible, and in the following way.
Many propositions were doubtless
first
discovered by drawing all sortsof figures
and lines inthem,andobservinga^parew^
relations of equality, &c., between parts.
It would, for example, be vei'y natural
to draw a rectangle, a figure with iour right angles (which, it
'
Arist. Anal. Post.
i.
5, 74 a 25 sq.

THE ANGLE IN A SEMICIRCLE
137
would be found, could be drawn in practice), and to put in the
two
diagonals.
The
equality
of
the
oppoisite
sides would
doubtless, in the first beginnings of geometry, be assumed as
obvious, or verified by measurement.
If then it was asmmed
that a rectangle is a figure with all its angles right angles and
each
side equal
to
its
opposite,
it \^ould be
easy
to deduce
certain consequences.
Take first the two triangles ADC, BCD.
Since by hypothesis AD = BC and CD
is common,
the two
triangles have the sides AD, DC respectively equal to the sides
BC, CD, and the included angles, being right angles, are equal
;
therefore the
triangles ADC, BCD are equal
in all
respects
(cf. Eucl.
I. 4), and accordingly the angles ^CD
(i.e. OGD) and
BDC
(i.e. ODG) are equal, whence (by the converse of Eucl. I. 5,
known
to
Thales) OD = OC.
Similarly by
means
of
the
equality of AB, CD we prove the equality of OB, OG.
Conse-
quently OB, OC, OD (and OA)
are all equal.
It follows that
a circle with centre
and radius OA passes through B, C, D
also
;
since AO, OC are in a straight line, AC is a diameter of
the circle, and the angle ABC, by hypothesis a right angle, is
an
' angle in a semicircle
'.
It would then appear that, given
any right angle as ABC standing on 4C as base, it was only
necessary to bisect AC at 0, and
would then be the centre of
a semicircle on J.C as diameter and passing through B.
The
construction indicated would be the construction of a
circle
about the right-angled triangle ABC, which seems to corre-
spond well enough to Pamphile's phrase- about
' describing on
(i. e. in) a circle a triangle (which shall be) right angled '.
(y)
Thales as astronomer.
Thales was
also
the
first Greek
astronomer.
Every one
knows the story of his falling into a well when star-gazing,
and being rallied by 'a clever and pretty maidservant from
Thrace
'
for being
so
eager
to know what
goes on
in
the
heavens that he
could not
see what was
straight
in
front
of him, nay, at his very feet.
But he was not merely a star-
gazer.
There is good evidence that he predicted a solar eclipse
which took place on May
28, 585
B.C.
We
can
conjecture
the basis of this prediction.
The Babylonians, as the result
of observations continued through
centuries, had discovered
the period
of 223
lunations after which
eclipses recur; and

i3Â»

.
lÂ±lAi^Ji.o
this period was doubtless known to Thales, either directly or
through the Egyptians as
intermediaries.
Thales, however,
cannot have known the cause of
eclipses
; he could not have
given the true
explanation
of lunar
eclipses (as the Doxo-
graphi say he did) because he held that the earth is a circular
disc floating on the water like a log
; and, if he had correctly
accounted
for
solar
eclipses,
it
is
impossible
that
all
the
succeeding Ionian philosophers should, one after another, have
put forward the fanciful explanations which we filnd recorded.
Thales's
other
achievements
in
astronomy
can
be
very
shortly stated.
Eudemus attributed to him the discovery of
'the
fact that
the
period
of
the sun with reference to the
solstices
is not always the same'^;
the vague phrase seems
to mean that he discovered the inequality
of the length
of
the four astronomical seasons, that
is, the four parts
of the
'tropical'
year
as
divided
by
the
solstices and
equinoxes.
Eudemus presumablj^ referred to the written works by Thaks
On the Solstice and On the Equinoxes mentioned by Diogenes
Laertius.^
He knew of the division of the year into 365 days,
which he probably learnt from Egypt.
Thales
observed
of
the
Hyades
that
there
wei'e two
of
them,
one north and
the
other
south.
He used the
Little
Bear as a means of finding the pole, and advised the Greeks
to sail by the Little Bear, as the Phoenicians did, in preference
to
their own
practice
of
sailing by
the
Great Bear.
This
instruction was probably noted in the handbook under the
title
of Nautical Astronomy, attributed by some
to Thales
and by others to Phocus of Samos.
It became the habit of the Doxographi to assign to Thales,
in common with other astronomers
in each
case, a number
of discoveries not made
till later.
The following
is the
list,
with the names
of the astronomers to whom the respective
discoveries may with most
certainty be attributed:
(1) the
fact that the moon takes
its light from the sun (Anaxagoras
and
possibly
Parmenides)
;
(2)
the
sphericity
of
the
earth
(Pythagoras)
;
(3) the
division
of
the
heavenly
sphere
into
five
zones
(Pythagoras and
Parmenides)
;
(4)
the
obliquity
of the
ecliptic (Genopides
of Chios);

sun's diameter as l/720th part of the sun's circle (Aristarchus
of Samos).
From
Tliales
to Pythagoras.
We are completely in the dark as to the progress of geometry
between the times of Thales and Pythagoras.
Anaximandkr
(born about 611/10 b. C.) put forward some daring and original
hypotheses
in
astronomy.
According
to him
the
earth
is
a short cylinder with two bases (on one of which we live) and
of depth equal to one-third of
the
diameter of
either
base.
It is suspended freely in the middle of the universe without
support,
being kept
there
in
equilibrium by
virtue
of
its
equidistance from the extremities and from the other heavenly
bodies
all round.
The
sun, moon, and
stars
are enclosed
in
opaque rings of compressed air concentric with the earth and
filled with fire
: what we see is the fire shinins: through vents
(like gas-jets, as it were).
The sun's ring is 27 or 28 times, the
moon's ring
19
times,
as
large
as
the
earth,
i.e.
the
sun's
and
moon's
distances
are
estimated
in terms
(as we may
suppose) of the radius of the circular
face of the earth
; the
fixed
stars
and
the
planets
are
nearer
to
the
earth than
the
sun and moon.
This
is the
first speculation on record
about sizes and distances.
Anaximander
is also said to have
introduced the gnomon
(or sun-dial with a
vertical
needle)
into Greece and to have shown on
it the
solstices, the times,
the
seasons, and the equinox ^ (according to Herodotus ^ the
Greeks learnt the use of the gnomon from the Babylonians).
He
is
also
credited,
like
Thales
before
him, with having
constructed a sphere to represent the heavens.'
But Anaxi-
mander has yet another claim to undying fame.
He was the
first who ventured
to draw a map
of
the
inhabited
earth.
The Egyptians had drawn maps before, but only of particular
districts; Anaximander boldly planned out the whole world
with
' the circumference
of the earth and sea '.*
This work
involved of course an attempt to estimate the dimensions of
the
earth, though we have no information as to his results.
It
is
clear,
therefore,
that Anaximander was something
of

THE EARLIEST GREEK GEOMETRY.
THALES
a mathematician;
but whether he
contributed anything
to
geometry
as
such
is
uncertain.
True,
Huiilas says that he
' introduced
the gnomon
and
generally
set
forth a
ske'tch
or outline of geometry
' (oXcos y(a>fj.eTpLas inroTinrcdaLv 'iSei^ev)
;
but it may be that
' geometry
'
is here used in its literal sense
of earth-measurement, and that the reference
is only to the
famous map.
' Next to Thales, Ameristus, a brother of the poet Stesichorus,
is mentioned as having engaged
in the study
of geometry
and from what Hippias of Elis says it appears that he acquired
a reputation for geometry.' ^
Stesichorus the poet lived about 630-550 B.C.
The brother
thei-efore would probably be nearly contemporary with Thales.
We know nothing of him except from the passage of
Proclus,
and even
his name
is
uncertain.
In
Friedlein's
edition
of
Proclus
it
is given as Mamercus, after a
later hand in cod.
Monac. 427
; Suidas has
it as Mamertinus
{s.v. Stesichorus)
Heiberg in his edition of Heron's Definitions writes Mamertius,
noting Mapfxerios as the reading of Cod. Paris. Gr. 2385.

V
PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
The special sei'viifc rendered by Pythagokas to geometry is
thus described in the Proclus summary
:
' After these (Thales and Amerlstus or Mamercus) Pythagoras
transformed the study of geometry into a
liberal education,
examining the principles of the
science from the beginning
and probing the theorems in an immaterial and
intellectual
manner: he
it was who discovered the theory of irrationals'
(or
' proportions ')
' and the construction of the cosmic figures '.^
These supposed
discoveries
will claim our
attention
pre-
sently;
the
rest
of
the
description
agrees
with
another
passage about the Pythagoreans
:
' Herein
', says
Proclus,
' I emulate the Pythagoreans who
even
had
a
conventional
phrase
to express what
I mean,
"a figure
and
a
platform,
not a
figure and
sixpence", by
which they implied that the geometry which
is deserving of
study is that which, at each new theorem, sets up a platform to
ascend by, and
lifts the
soul on high instead of allowing
it
to go down among
sensible
objects and
so
become
subser-
vient to the common needs of this mortal life '.^
In
like manner we are told that
' Pythagoras used
defini-
tions on account of the mathematical nature of the subject V^
which again
implies that he took the first steps towards the
systematization of geometry as a subject in itself.
A comparatively early authority, Callimachus (about 250 B.C.),
is quoted by Diodorus as having said that Pythagoras
dis-
covered some geometrical problems himself and was the
first
to introduce others from Egypt into Greece.*
Diodorus gives
what appear to be five verses of Callimachus minus a few words
;

142
PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
a longer fragment including the same passage is now available
(though the text is still deficient) in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri.^
The story
is that one Bathycles, an Arcadian, bequeathed
a
cup to lie given to the best of the Seven Wise Men.
The cup
first went
to Thales, and
then, after going the round of the
others, was given
to him a second time.
We are
told that
Bathycles's son brought the cup to Thales, and that (presum-
ably on the occasion of the first presentation)
' by a happy chance he found
.
. the
old man scraping the
ground and drawing the figure discovered by the Phrygian
Euphorbus (= Pythagoras), who was the first of men to draw
even
scalene
triangles and a
circle
.
.
, and who prescribed
abstinence from animal food '.
Notwithstanding the anachronism, the
' figure discovered by
Euphorbus
' is presumably the famous proposition about the
squares on the sides of a right-angled triangle.
In Diodorus's
quotation the words after
' scalene triangles
' are kvkXov eyrra-
/nJKr]{iTrTafj.r]Kâ‚¬' Hunt), which seems unintelligible
unless the
' seven-lengthed circle
' can be taken as meaning the
' lengths of
seven
circles
' (in
the
sense
of the
seven independent orbits
of the sun, moon, and
planets) or the circle (the zodiac) com-
prehending them all.^
But
it
is time
to pass on to the propositions in geometry
which are definitely attributed to the Pythagoreans.

But kvkXov tXiKa,

It may have been suggested to
Diels by Hermesianax's

(Athenaeus

attributing
to
Pythagoras the
' refinements of the geometry of spirals
' {eXUmv Ko^\|^a
y(a>fieTpiris).
^ One naturally thinks of Plato's dictum (Thnaeus 39 a, b)
about the circles of the sun, moon, and planets being twisted into spirals
by the combination of their own motion with that of the daily rotation
;
but
this can hardly be the meaning here.
A more
satisfactory sense
would be secured if we could imagine the circle to be the circle described
about
the
'scalene'
(right-angled)
triangle,
i.e.
if we
could take the
reference to be to the discovery of the
fact that the angle in a
se/ni-
circle is a right angle, a discovery which, as we have seen, was alterna-
tively ascribed to Thales and Pythagoras.

PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
143
Discoveries attributed to the Pythagoreans.
(a)
Equality of the sum of
tfie
three angles
of a triangle
to
tivo right angles.
We have seen that Thales, if he really discovered that the
angle in a semicircle
is a right angle, was in a position, first,
to show that in any right-angled triangle the sum of the three
angles is equal to two right angles, and then, bj^ drawing the
perpendicular from a ^â€¢ertex
of any triangle
to the opposite
side
and
so
dividing
the
triangle
into two
right-angled
triangles, to prove that the sum of the three angles of any
triangle whatever is equal to two right angles.
If this method
of passing from the particular case of a right-angled triangle to
that of any triangle did not occur to Thales, it is at any rate
hardly likely to have escaped Pythagoras. But all that we know
for
certain
is
that Eudemus
referred
to
the
Pythagoreans
the
discovery
of
the
general
theorem that in any
triangle
the sum of the interior angles
is equal to two right angles.^
Eudemus goes on to tell us how they proved it.
The method
differs slightly from that of Euclid, but depends, equally with
Euclid's proof, on the properties of parallels
;
it can therefore
only have been evolved at a time when those properties were
already known.
Let ABC be any triangle
; through A draw DE parallel
to BG.
Then,
sincer BC\ DE
are
parallel,
the
alternate angles DAB, ABG are equal.
Similarly
the
alternate
angles EAG,
AGB are equal.
Therefore the sum of the angles ABG,
AGB is equal to the sum of the angles DAB, EAG.
Add to each sum the angle BAG; therefore the sum of the
three angles ABC, AGB, BAG,
i.e. the
three angles
of
the
triangle, is equal to the sum of the angles DAB, BAG, GAE,
i.e. to two right angles.
We need not hesitate to credit the Pythagoreans with the
more general propositions about the angles of any polygon,
1 Proclus on Eucl.
I, p. 397. 2.

144
PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
namely (1) that, if n be the number of the sides or angles, the
interior angles of the polygon are together equal
to 2wâ€”
right angles, and
(2) that the
exterior angles of the polygon
(being the supplements
of
the
interior
angles
respectively)
are together equal to four right angles.
The propositions are
interdependent, Bnd Aristotle twice quotes the
latter. '^
The
Pythagoreans
also
discovered
that
the
only
three
regular
polygons the angles of which, if placed together round a com-
mon point as vertex, just fill up the space (four right angles)
round the point are the
equilateral triangle, the square, and
the regular hexagon.
(/?)
The 'Theorem of Pythagoras'
( = Eucl.
I. 47).
Though
this
is the
proposition universally associated
by
tradition with the name of Pythagoras, no really trustworthy
evidence exists that
it was actually discovered by him.
The
comparatively late
writers who attribute
it
to him add the
story
that
he
sacrificed
an
ox
to celebrate
his
discovery.
Plutarch^ (born about
a.d.
46), Athenaeus ^ (about a.d.
200),
and Diogenes Laertius* (A.D. 200 or later) all quote the verses
of Apollodorus the 'calculator' already referred
to
(p.
133).
But Apollodorus speaks of the
' famous theorem
', or perhaps
' figure
''
(ypdfifia),
the
discovery
of which was
the
occa-
sion of the sacrifice, without saying what the theorem was.
Apollodorus is otherwise unknown
; he may have been earlier
than
Cicero,
for
Cicero^
tells
the
story
in the same form
without
specifying what geometrical
discovery was
meant,
and merely adds
that
he does not
believe
in the
sacrifice,
because
the
Pythagorean
ritual forbade
sacrifices
in which
blood was
shed.
Vitruvius^ (first century B.C.) connects the
sacrifice with the discovery of the property of the particular
triangle
3, 4, 5.
Plutarch,
in quoting Apollodorus, questions
whether the theorem about the square of the hypotenuse was
meant, or the problem of the application of an area, while in
another place
"^ he says that the occasion of the sacrifice was

the
problem,
' given two

to
ajyply
a
third
which
shall
be
equal
to
the
one and
similar
to

this problem
is unquestionably
finer than the theorem about the square on the hjqDotenuse.
But Athenaeus and Porphyry^
(a.d.
233-304) connect
the
sacrifice with the latter proposition
;
so does Diogenes Laertius
in one place.
We come lastly to Proclus, who is very cautious,
mentioning
the
story
but
declining
to commit
himself
to
the view that
it was Pythagoras or even any single person
who made the discovery
:
' If we listen to those who wish to recount ancient history,
we may find some of them referring
this theorem
to Pytha-
goras, and saying that he
sacrificed an ox in honour of his
discovery.
But
for my part, while
I admire
those luho
first
observed
the
truth
of
this theorem,
I marvel more
at
the
writer of the Elements, not only because he made it fast by a
most lucid demonstration, but because he compelled assent to
the still more general theorem by the irrefutable arguments of
science in the sixth book.'
It is possible that all these authorities may have built upon
the verses of Apollodorus
; but it is remarkable that, although
in the verses themselves the particular theorem
is not
speci-
fied, there is practical unanimity in attributing to Pythagoras
the theorem of Eucl.
I. 47.
Even in Plutarch's observations
expressing doubt about the particular occasion of the
sacrifice
there
is nothing
to
suggest that he had any
hesitation
in
accepting as discoveries of Pythagoras both the theorem of the
square on the hypotenuse and the problem of the application
of an area.
Like Hankel,^ therefore, I would not go so far as
to deny to Pythagoras the credit of the discovery of our pro-
position
; nay, I like to believe that tradition is right, and that
it was really his.
True, the discovery
is also claimed
for
India.^
The work
relied on
is the A^Jastambn-ISulba-Sutru, the date of which
is
put at least as early as the fifth or fourth century B.C., while
it
is remarked that the matter of
it must have
been much

to
146
PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
older than the book
itself
; thus one of the constructions for
right angles, using cords of lengths 15, 36, 39 (= 5, 12, 13), was
known at the time of the Tdittiriyu Samhitd and the Sata-
'patha Brdhmaiia,
still
older works belonging to the eighth
century B. c. at
latest.
A feature
of the A'pastamba-Sulha-
Sutra is the construction of right angles in this way by means
of cords of lengths equal to the three sides of certain rational
right-angled triangles
(or, as Apastamba
calls them, rational
rectangles,
i. e. those
in which
the
diagonals
as well as
the
sides are rational).
The rational right-angled triangles actually
used are
(3, 4, 5),
(5,
12,
13), (8, 15, 17), (12, 35, 37).
There is
a proposition
stating the theorem of Eucl.
I. 47 as a fact in
general terms, but without proof, and there are
rules based
upon
it for constructing a square equal to (l) the sum of two
given
squares and
(2)
the
difference
of two
squares.
But
certain
considerations
suggest
doubts
as
to
whether
the
proposition had been established by any proof applicable to
all
cases.
Thus
Apastamba
mentions
onlj^
seven
rational
right-angled ti'iangles, really reducible to the above-mentioned
four
(one other,
7, 24, 25, appears,
it
is true, in the Baudha-
yana
S.
S., supposed to be older than Apastamba)
; he had no
general rule such as that attributed to Pythagoras for forming
any number of rational right-angled triangles;
he
refers
to
his seven in the words
' so many recognizable constructions
are there
', implying that he knew of no other such triangles.
On the other hand, the truth of the theorem was recognized in
the case of the
isosceles right-angled triangle
; there is even
a construction for V2, or the length of the diagonal of a square
with side unity, which
is constructed as (1-|
1
|
â€¢^
V
3
3.4
3.4.34/
of the side, and
is then used with the side for the purpose of
drawing the square on the side
: the length taken is of course
an approximation to
\^2 derived from the consideration that
2.12'^ = 288 = 17^ â€” 1
; but the author does not say anything
which suggests any knowledge on his part that the approxi-
mate value
is
not
exact.
Having drawn by means
of the
approximate value
of the diagonal an inaccurate square, he
proceeds
to use
it
to construct a square with area equal
to
three times the
original
square,
or,
in other words,
to con-
struct
Vs,
wliich
is
therefore
only
approximately
found.

THE 'THEOREM OF PYTHAGORAS'
147
Thus the theorem
is
enunciated and used as
if
it were
of
general application
; there
is, however, no sign of any general
proof
; there is nothing in fact to show that the assumption of
its universal truth was founded on anything better than an
imperfect induction from a certain number of cases, discovered
empirically,
of
triangles with
sides
in
the
ratios
of whole
numbers
in which the property
(1) that the
square on the
longest side
is equal to the sum of the squares on the other
two was found
to
be. always accompanied by the property
(2) that the latter two sides include a right angle.
But, even
if the Indians had actually attained
to a
scientific proof of
the general theorem, there
is no evidence or probability that
the Greeks obtained
it from India
; the subject was doubtless
developed quite independently in the two countries.
The next
question
is,
hoM^ was
the theorem
proved by
Pythagoras
or
the
Pythagoreans'?
Vitruvius
says
that
Pythagoras first discovered the triangle
(3, 4, 5), and doubtless
the theorem was
first suggested by the
discovery that
this
triangle
is right-angled;
but
this
discovery probably came
to
Greece
from
Egypt.
Then a
very
simple
construction
would show
that
the theorem
is true
of an
isosceles
right-
angled
triangle.
Two possible lines are suggested on which
the general proof may have been developed.
One
is that of
decomposing square and rectangular areas into squares, rect-
angles and triangles, and piecing them together again after
the manner
of
Eucl., Book
II
;
the
isosceles
right-angled
triangle
gives
the most obvious case of
this method.
The
other line
is one depending upon proportions
; and we have
good reason for supposing that Pythagoras developed a theory
of proportion.
That theory was applicable to commensurable
magnitudes only
; but this would not be any obstacle to the
use
of
the method
so long as the existence of
the incom-
mensurable
or
irrational
remained
undiscovered.
From
Proclus's
remark
that,
while
he
admired
those who
first
noticed
the
truth
of
the
theorem, he admired
Euclid
still
more
for his most clear proof of
it and
for the
irrefutable
demonstration of the extension of the theorem
in Book VI,
it is natural to conclude that Euclid's proof in I. 47 was new,
though this is not quite certain.
Now VI. 31 could be proved
at once by using
I. 47 along with VI. 22; but Euclid proves
L 2

148
PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
it
independently
of
I.
47 by means
of
proportions.
This
seems
to
suggest
that he
proved
I.
47 by
the methods
of
Book I instead of by proportions in order to get the proposi-
tion into Book
I instead of Book VI,, to which
it must have
been
relegated
if
the
proof by
proportions had been
used.
If, on the other hand, Pythagoras had proved
it by means
of the methods of Books I and
II, it would hardly have been
necessary for Euclid
to devise a new proof of
I. 47.
Hence
it would appear most probable that Pythagoras would prove
the proposition by means
of
his
(imperfect) theory
of
pro-
portions.
The proof may have taken one of three different
shapes.
(1)
If ABC
is a
triangle
right-
angled
at
A,
and AD
is
perpen-
dicular
to BG,
the triangles DBA,
BAG
are both
similar
to the
tri-
angle ABG.
It follows from the theorems of
Eucl. VI. 4 and 17 that
BA-' = BD.BG,
AG^^GD.BG,
whence, by addition, BA'^ + AG^ = BG\
It will be observed that this proof
is in substance identical
with that of
Eucl.
I. 47, the difference being that the
latter
uses
the
relations between parallelograms and
triangles on
the same
base and between
the same
parallels
instead
of
proportions.
The probability
is that
it was
this
particular
proof by proportions which suggested to Euclid the method
of
I. 47
; but the transformation of the proof depending on
proportions into one based on Book L only (which was abso-
lutely required under Euclid's arrangement
of the Elements)
was a stroke of genius.
(2)
It
would
be
observed
that,
in
the
similar
triangles
DBA, DAG, ABG, the corresponding
sides
opposite
to
the
right angle in each case are BA, AG, BG.
The triangles therefore are in the duplicate ratios of these
sides, and so are the squares on the latter.
But of the triangles two, namely DBA, DAG, make up the
third, ABG.

THE 'THEOREM OF PYTHAGORAS'
149
The same must therefore be the case with the squares, or
(3) The
method
of
VI.
31
might
have
been
followed
exactly, with squares taking the place of any similar recti-
lineal figures.
Since the triangles DBA, ABG are similar,
BD:AB= AB: BC,
or BD, AB, BC are three proportionals, whence
AB"^
: BC' = BD'^ -.AB^^ BD: BC.
Similarly,
A C^
: BG^ = CD
: BC.
Therefore
(BA^ + AG^)
: BG^ = {BD + DC)
: BC.
[V. 24]

If, on the other hand, the proposition was originally proved
by the methods of Euclid, Books I, II alone (which, as I have
said, seems the
less probable
supposition), the suggestion of

PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY

A2:>plication of areas and geometrical
algebra.
We have
seen
that,
in
connexion
with
the story of the
sacrifice
of an ox, Plutarch attributes to Pythagoras himself
the
discovery of the problem of the application of an area
or,
as
he
says
in
another
place,
the problem
' Given two
figures, to " apply " a third figure which shall be equal to the
one, and
similar
to the
other
(of
the given
figures).'
The
latter problem (= Eucl. VI.
25)
is,
strictly speaking, not so
much a case of applying an area as of constructing a figure,
because
the
base
is
not
given
in
length;
but
it depends
directly upon
the
simplest
case
of
' application
of
areas
',
namely the problem, solved
in
Eucl.
I.
44,
45, of applying
to a given
straight
line
as base a parallelogram
containing
a
given
angle
and
equal
in
area
to
a
given
triangle
or
rectilineal
figure.
The
method
of
application
of
areas
is
fundamental in Greek geometry and requires detailed
notice.
We shall see that in
its general form
it
is equivalent to the
geometrical solution of a mixed quadratic equation, and
it
is
therefore an
essential part
of what has been appropriately
called geometrical algebra.
It
is
certain
that
the
theory
of
application
of
areas
originated with
the
Pythagoreans,
if not with
Pythagoras
himself.
We have this on the authority of Eudemus, quoted
in the following passage of Proelus
' These things, says Eudemus, are ancient, being discoveries
of the Muse of the Pythagoreans, I mean the application of
areas (napa^oXfj tS>v ^uipiuiv), their exceeding
(virepjSoXri) and
their falling short (eXXeiyjns).
It was from the Pythagoreans
that
later
geometers
[i. e.
Apollonius
of
Perga]
took
the
names,
which' they then transferred
to
the
so-called
conic
lines
(curves), calling one of these a parabola
(application),
another
a
hyperbola
(exceeding),
and
the
third
an
ellipse
(falling short), whereas
those
god-like men
of
old saw
the
things signified by these names in the construction, in a plane,
of
areas upon a given
finite
straight
line.
For, when you
have a straight line set out, and lay the given area exactly
alongside the whole of the straight
line, they say that you
apiply the said area
; when, however, you make the length of
the area greater than the straight
line,
it
is said to
exceed,
and, when you make it less, in which case after the area has
been drawn there
is some part of the straight line extending

APPLICATION OF AREAS
151
beyond
it,
it
is said to fall
short.
Euclid, too, in the sixth
book speaks in this way both of exceeding and falling short
;
but in this place
(I. 44) he needed the a'p'pUcatioii simply, as
be sought to apply
to a given
straight
line an
area equal
to
a given
triangle,
in
order
that we might have
in
our
power, not only the construction {a-varaat^) of a parallelogram
3qual
to a given
triangle, but
also the application of
it to
% limited straight
line.' "
The
general
form
of
the problem
involving
application
with exceeding ov falling short is the following
:
' To apply
to a given
straight line a rectangle
(or,
more
generally, a parallelogram) equal to a given rectilineal figure,
and
(1) exceeding or
(2) fcdling short by a square figure
(or,
in the more general case, by a parallelogram similar to a given
parallelogram).'
The most general
form, shown by the words in
brackets,
is found
in
Eucl. VI.
28,
29, which
are
equivalent
to
the
a'eometrical solution of the quadratic equations
aX-i
X'' := â€” 3
â€”
c
m
ind VI. 27
gives
the
condition
of
possibility
of
a
solution
when the sign
is negative and the parallelogram falls short.
This general case of course requires the use of proportions;
but the simpler case where the area applied
is a rectangle,
ind
the
form
of the portion which overlaps or
falls short
is a square, can be solved by means of Book II only.
The
proposition 11.
1 1
is the geometrical solution of the particular
j[uadratic equation
a (a â€” x) = x^
3r
x^ + ax â€”
a'-.
The propositions
II.
5 and
6
are
in the form
of theorems.
Taking,
e.g., the figure of the former proposition, and sup-
posing AB â€” a, BD = X, we have
ax â€” x^ â€” rectangle AH
= gnomon NOP.
[f, then, the area of the gnomon

APPLICATION OF AREAS

application of areas.
The whole
of Book II, with the latter
section of Book I from Prop. 42 onwards, may be said to deal
with
the
transformation
of
areas
into
equivalent
areas
of
different
shape
or
composition by
means
of
'application'
and the use of the theorem of
I.
47.
Eucl.
II.
9 and 10 are
special cases which are very useful in geometry generally, but
were also employed by the Pythagoreans for the specific purpose
of proving the property of
' side-
' and
' diameter-
' numbers,
the object of which was clearly to develop a
series of closer
and closer approximations to the value of -/2 (see p. 93 ante).
The geometrical algebra, therefore, as we find
it in Euclid,
Books I and II, was Pythagorean.
It was of course confined
to problems not involving expressions above the second degree.
Subject
to
this,
it was
an
effective
substitute
for
modern
algebra.
The
product
of two
linear
factors was
a
rect-
angle, and Book
II of
Euclid made
it possible
to multiply
two
factors with any number
of
linear terms
in each
; the
compression
of the
result into
a
single product
(rectangle)
followed by means
of
the
a2J2dication-theorem
(Eucl.
I. 44).
That theorem
itself corresponds to dividing the product
of
any two linear factors by a third linear expression.
To trans-
form any area into a square, we have only to turn the area
into a
rectangle
(as
in
Eucl.
I. 45), and then find a square
equal to
that rectangle
by the method of
Eucl. II. 14; the
latter problem then is equivalent to the extraction of the square
root.
And we have
seen that the theorems
of
Eucl. II.
5, 6
enable mixed quadratic equations of certain types to be solved
so
far as
their roots are
real.
In
cases where a quadratic
equation has one or both roots negative, the Greeks would
transform
it into one having a positive root or roots (by the
equivalent of substituting â€” x for x)
; thus, where one root
is
positive and one negative, they would
solve the problem in
two parts by taking two
cases.
The other great engine of the Greek geometrical algebra,
namely the method of proportions, was not in
its full extent
available
to the Pythagoreans because
their theory
of pro-
portion was
only
applicable
to commensurable magnitudes
(Eudoxus was the first to establish the general theory, applic-
able
to commensurables and incommensurables
alike, which
we find in Eucl. V, VI).
Yet it cannot be doubted that they

154
PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
used the method quite freely before the discovery of the irra-
tional showed them that they were building on an insecure
and inadequate foundation.
(S)
The irrational.
To return to the sentence about Pythagoras in the summary
of
Proelus already quoted more than once
(pp. 84, 90, 141).
Even
if the reading
aXoycoy were right and Proelus
really
meant to attribute to Pythagoras the discovery of 'the theory,
or study, of irrationals ', it would be necessary to consider the
authority for this statement, and how far
it
is supported by
other e\ddence.
We note that it occurs in a relative sentence
OS
8rj
.
.
.
, which has the appearance of being inserted in paren-
thesis by the compiler of the summary rather than copied from
his original
source
; and the shortened form of the first part
of the same summary published in the Variae collectio aes of
Hultsch's Heron, and now included by Heiberg
in
Heron's
Definitions,^ contains no such parenthesis.
Other authorities
attribute the discovery of the theory of the irrational not to
Pythagoras but to the Pythagoreans.
A scholium to Euclid,
Book X, says that
' the Pythagoreans were the first to address themselves to the
investigation of commensurability, having discovered it as the
result of
their observation of numbers
;
for, while the unit is
a common measure of all numbers, they were unable to find
a common measure of all magnitudes,
.
.
. because all magni-
tudes are divisible ad infinitum, and never leave a magnitude
which
is
too
small
to admit
of
further
division, but that
remainder is equally divisible ad infinitum,'
and so on.
The scholiast adds the legend that
' the first of the Pythagoreans who made public the investiga-
tion of these matters perished in a shipwreck '.^
Another commentary on Eucl. X discovered by Woepcke in
an Arabic
translation and believed, with good reason, to be
part of the commentary
of Pappus, says that the theory
of
irrational magnitudes
' had its origin in the school of Pytha-
goras
'.
Again, it is impossible that Pythagoras himself should
have discovered a
' theory
' or
' study
'
of irrationals in any
' Heron,
vol. iv, ed. Heib., p. 108.
'' Euclid, ed. Heib., vol.
v, pp. 415, 417.

THE IRRATIONAL
155
proper sense.
We are told in the Theaetetua ^ that Theodoras
of Cyrene
(a pupil
of Protagoras and the teacher of
Plato)
proved the irrationality of Vz,
Vs, &c., up to 7X7, and this
must have been at a date not much, if anything, earlier than
400 B. c.
; while it was Theaetetus who, inspired by Theodorus's
investigation of
these
particular 'roots'
(or surds), was
the
first to generalize the theory, seeking terms to cover all such
incommensurables
;
this
is confirmed by the continuation
of
the passage from
Pappus's commentary, which says that the
theory was
'considerably developed
by
Theaetetus
the
Athenian, who
gave proof, in this part of mathematics as in others, of ability
which has been justly admired ...
As
for
the
exact
dis-
tinctions
of
the above-named magnitudes and
the
rigorous
demonstrations of the propositions
to which this theory gives
rise,
I
believe
that
they were
chiefly
established
by
this
mathematician '.
It follows from all this that, if Pythagoras discovered any-
thing about irrationals, it was not any
' theory
' of irrationals
but, at the most, some particular case of incommensurability.
Now the
passage which
states that Theodorus proved that
V 3, Vo, &c. are incommensurable says nothing of
-/2.
The
I'eason
is, no doubt, that the incommensurability of
-v/2 had
been proved
earlier, and everything points to the probability
that this was the
first case to be discovered.
But, if Pytha-
goras discovered even this, it is diflicult to see how the theory
that number
is the essence of all existing things, or that
all
things are made of number, could have held
its ground for
any
length
of
time.
The
evidence
suggests
the
conclusion
that geometry developed itself for some time on the basis of
the numerical theory of proportion which was inapplicable to
any but commensurable magnitudes, and that
it received an
unexpected blow later by reason of the discovery of the irra-
tional.
The
inconvenience
of
this
state
of
things, which
involved the restriction or abandonment of the use of propor-
tions as a method pending the
discovery of the generalized
theory by Eudoxus, may account for the idea of the existence
of the irrational having been kept secret, and of punishment
having overtaken the first person who divulged
it.

PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
If then
it was not Pythagoras but some Pythagorean who
discovered the irrationality of
â€¢v/2, at what date are we
to
suppose the discovery to have been made 1
A recent writer ^
on the subject holds
that
it was the
later Pythagoreans who
made the discovery, not much before 410
B.C.
It
is impos-
sible, he argues, that
fifty or a hundred years would elapse
between the discovery of the irrationality of Vi and the like
discovery by Theodorus (about 410 or 400 B.C.) about the other
surds
-/S,
-/s, &c.
It
is
difficult
to
meet
this
argument
except by the supposition
that, in the interval, the thoughts
of geometers had been taken up by other famous problems,
such as the quadrature of the circle and the duplication of the
cube
(itself equivalent to finding ^2).
Another argument is
based on the passage in the Laivs where the Athenian stranger
speaks of the shameful ignorance of the generality of Greeks,
who are not aware that
it
is not all geometrical magnitudes
that are commensurable with one another
; the speaker adds
that
it was only
' late
'
{6\jfi
ttots) that he himself learnt the
truth.^
Even
if we knew for certain whether
' late
' means
' late in the day
' or
' late
in
life
', the expression would not
help much towards determining the date of the first discovery
of the irrationality of V2
; for the language of the passage is
that of rhetorical exaggeration
(Plato speaks of men who are
unacquainted with
the
existence
of
the
irrational
as more
comparable to swine than
to human
beings).
Moreover, the
irrational appears in the ReinMic
as something well known,
and precisely with reference
to
\/2
; for the expressions 'the
rational
diameter
of
(the
square
the
side
of which
is)
5
[= the
approximation
-/(49)
or
7]
and
the
'irrational
(dpprjTos) diameter of 5
' [= \/(50)] are used without any word
of explanation.^
Further, we have a well-authenticated
title of a work by
Democritus (born 470 or 460 B.C.), nepl aXoycov ypamxaiv Kal
vaarSiv a/?,
' two books on irrational

THE IRRATIONAL
157
suggests that aXoyos does not here mean irrational or incom-
mensurable at
all, but that the book was an attempt to con-
nect the
atomic
theory
with continuous magnitudes
(lines)
through
' indivisible
lines
'
(cf.
the Aristotelian
treatise On
indivisible
lines), and that Democritus meant
to say
that,
since any two lines are alike made up of an
infinite number
of the (indivisible) elements, they cannot be said
to have any
expressible ratio to one another, that
is, he would regard them
as 'having no ratio'!
It
is, however, impossible
to suppose
that a mathematician of the calibre of Democritus could have
denied that any two lines can have a
ratio
to one another
;
moreover, on this view, since no two straight lines would have
a ratio to one another, dXoyoi ypayniai would not be a class of
lines, but
all lines, and
the
title would
lose
all
point.
But
indeed, as we
shall
see, it
is also on other grounds inconceiv-
able that Democritus should have been an upholder of
' indi-
visible lines
' at
all.
I do not attach any importance
to the
further argument
used
in support
of the
interpretation
in
question, namely that
akoyo's
in the
sense of
' irrational
'
is
not found
in
any
other
writer
before
Aristotle, and
that
Plato
uses
the words
dpprjros and
dav'/ifieTpos
only.
The
latter statement
is not even
strictly
true, for Plato does
in
fact use the word dXoyoL specifically of ypa/xfiai in the passage
of the Republic where he speaks of youths not being dXoyoi
axj-mp
ypajjLfiat,
' irrational like
lines '}
Poor as the joke
is,
it
proves
that
dXoyoi
ypaixfiai was a
recognized
technical
term, and
the remark looks
like a sly reference to the very
treatise of Democritus
of which we
are speaking.
I think
there is no reason to doubt that the book was on
' irrationals
in
the
technical
sense.
We know from other
sources that
Democritus was
already on
the
track
of
infinitesimals
in
geometry; and nothing
is more
likely than
that he would
write on the kindred subject of irrationals.
I
see therefore no reason
to doubt
that the
irrationality
of
â€¢/2 was discovered by some Pythagorean at a date appre-
ciably earlier than that of Democritus
; and indeed the simple
proof of
it indicated by
Aristotle and
set out in the propo-
sition
interpolated
at
the
end
of
Euclid's
Book X seems
appropriate to an early stage in the development of geometry.

(e)
The jive regular
solids.
The same parenthetical sentence in Proclus which attributes
to
Pythagoras
the
discovery
of
the
theory
of
irrationals
(or proportions)
also
states that he discovered the 'putting
together
{avaTacns) of the cosmic
figures'
(the
five
regular
solids).
As usual, there has been controversy as to the sense
in which this phrase is to be taken, and as
to the possibility
of Pythagoras having done what is attributed to him, in any
sense
of
the
words.
I
do
not
attach
importance
to
the
argument
that, whereas Plato, presumably
' Pythagorizing
',
assigns the
first four solids to the four elements,
earth,
fire,
air,
and
water, Empedocles
and
not
Pythagoras
was
the
first to declare these four elements to be the material princi-
ples from which the universe was evolved
;
nor do
I think
it follows that, because the elements are four, only the
first
four
solids had been discovered
at the time when the
four
elements came
to be recognized, and that the dodecahedron
must therefore have been discovered
later.
I see no reason
why
all
five should not have been
discovered by the
early
Pytliagoreans before any question of identifying them with
the elements
arose.
The fragment of
Philolaus, indeed, says
that
' there
are
five bodies
in the
sphere, the
fire, water,
earth,
and
air
in
the
sphere, and
the
vessel
of
the
sphere
itself
making the fifth V
but as
this
is
only to be understood of the elements in the
sphere of the universe, not of the solid
figures, in accordance
with Diels's
translation,
it would appear that
Plato
in the
Timaeus'^
is
the
earliest authority
for
the
allocation, and
it may very well be due to Plato himself (were not the solids
called the
' Platonic figures
' ?), although put into the mouth
of
a
Pythagorean.
At
the same
time,
the
fact
that
the
TimMeus
is
fundamentally Pythagorean may have induced
Aetius's authority (probably Theophrastus)
to conclude

hastily that
' here, too, Plato Pythagorizes
', and
to say dog-
matically on the faith of this that
' Pythagoras, seeing that there are
five
solid
figures, which
are also called the mathematical figures, says that the earth
arose from
the
cube,
fire from
the pyramid,
air from
the
octahedron, water from the
icosahedron, and
the sphere
of
the universe from the dodecahedron.'
'â€¢
It may, I think, be conceded that Pythagoras or the early
Pythagoreans would
hardly be able
to
' construct
'
the
five
regular solids in the sense of a complete theoretical construc-
tion such
as we find
in
Eucl. XIII
; and
it
is possible that
Theaetetus was the first tÂ« give these constructions, whether
iypa-^e
in
Suidas's
notice means
that
' he was
the
first
to
construct'
or 'to write U'pon the five solids so called'.
But
there
is no reason why the Pythagoreans
should
not have
'put together' the five figures in the manner in which Plato
puts them
together
in
the
Timaeus,
namely, by
bringing
a
certain number of angles of equilateral triangtes, squares,
or pentagons severally together at one point so as to make
a solid angle, and then completing all the solid angles in that
way.
That the
early Pythagoreans should have discovered
the
five
regular
solids in this
elementary way agrees
well
with what we know
of their having put angles of
cei'tain
regular
figures round
a
point and shown
that
only
three
kinds
of
such
angles would
fill up the space in one plane
round the point.^
How elementary the construction still was
in Plato's hands may be inferred from the fact that he argues
that only
three
of the elements are transformable into
one
another
because
only
three
of
the
solids
are made from
equilateral triangles
; these
triangles, when present
in
sufti-
cient numbers in given regular solids, can be separated again
and
redistributed
so
as to form regular solids of a different
number of
faces,
as
if the
solids were
really hollow
shells
bounded by the triangular faces as planes or laminae (Aris-
totle criticizes this in JDe caelo,
iii.

!
We may indeed
treat
Plato'.s
elementary method
as an
indication
that
this was
actually the method employed by the earliest Pythagoreans.

PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
Putting
together
squares
three by
three,
forming
eight
solid angles, and equilateral triangles three by three, four by
four, or five by five, forming four, six, or twelve
solid angles
respectively, we readily form a cube, a tetrahedron, an octa-
hedron,
or an
icosahedron, but
the
fifth
regular
solid,
the
dodecahedron, requires a new element, the regular pentagon.
True,
if we form
the
angle
of an
icosahedron by
putting
together five equilateral triangles, the bases of those triangles
when put together form a regular pentagon
; but Pythagoras
or the Pythagoreans would require a theoretical construction.
What is the evidence that the early Pythagoreans could have
constructed
and
did
construct
pentagons ?
That they
did
construct them seems established by the story of Hippasus,
' who was a Pythagore'an
but, owing
to
his being
the
first
to publish and Write down the (construction of
the)
sphere
with
(e/f, from) the twelve pentagons, perished by shipwreck
for his impiety, but received credit for the discovery, whereas
it really belonged to HIM
{(Keivov tov dvSpos), for
it
is thus
that they refer to Pythagoras, and they do not
call him by
his name,' ^
The connexion
of Hippasus's name with the
subject can
hardly be an
invention, and
the
story
probably
points
to
a
positive achievement by him, while
of
course the Pytha-
goreans' jealousy for the Master accounts for the
reflection
upon Hippasus and the moral.
Besides, there
is evidence for
the very early
existence
of dodecahedra in actual
fact.
In
1885
there was
discovered on Monte
Lofia
(Colli Euganei,
near Padua) a regular dodecahedron of Etruscan origin, which
is held to date from the first half of the first millennium B. c.^
Again, it appears that there are extant no less than twenty-six
objects of dodecahedral form which are of Celtic origin.^
It
may therefore be that Pythagoras or the Pythagoreans had
seen dodecahedra of
this kind, and that their merit was
to
have
treated
them
as
mathematical
objects
and
brought
them into their theoretical geometry.
Could they then have

THE FIVE REGULAR SOLIDS
161
constructed the regular pentagon 1
The answer must, I think,
be yes.
If ABODE be a regular pentagon, and AG, AD, GE
be joined, it is easy to prove, from the (Pythagorean) proposi-
tions about the sum
of the internal angles of a polygon and
the sum
of the angles
of a triangle, that each of the angles
BAG, DAE, EGD
is fths
of
a right angle, whence, in the
triangle AGD, the angle GAD
is fths of a right angle, and
each of the base angles AGD, ADG is -fths
of a right angle
or double
of the
vertical angle GAD
; and from these
facts
it
easily follows
that,
if GE and AD meet in F, GDF is an
isosceles triangle equiangular, and therefore similar, to AGD,
and
also
that AFâ€” FG = GD.
Now,
since
the
triangles
AGD, GDF are similar,
AG:GD = GD:DF,
or
AD:AF= AF:FD;
that
is, if AD
is given, the length of AF, or GD, is found by
dividing AD at i^in
' extreme and mean ratio' by Eucl. II. 11.
This
last
problem
is
a
particular
case
of
the problem
of
' application
of
area,s
', and
therefore was
obviously within
the power of the Pythagoreans.
This method of constructing
a pentagon
is,
of course, that taught in Eucl. IV.
10, 11.
If
further evidence
is wanted of the interest of the early Pytha-
goreans
in the regular pentagon,
it
is furnished by the fact,
attested by Lucian and the scholiast to the Clouds of Aristo-
phanes, that the
'triple interwoven
triangle, the pentagon',
i. e. the star-pentagon,
waÂ»s used by the Pythagoreans
as a
symbol of recognition between the members of the same school,
and was called by them Health.^
Now it will be seen from the
separate diagram of the star-pentagon above that
it actually

shows the equal sides of the five isosceles triangles of the type
referred to and also the points at which they are divided in
extreme and mean
ratio.
(I should
perhaps add
that the
pentagram
is said to be found on the vase of Aristonophus
found
at
Caere
and
supposed
to
belong
to
the
seventh
century B.C., while the finds at Mycenae include ornaments of
pentagonal form.)
It would be easy to conclude that the dodecahedron
is in-
scribable
in a
sphere, and
to
find
the centre
of
it, without
constructing both in the elaborate manner of EucL. XIII/17
and working out the relation between an edge of the dodeca-
hedron and
the
radius of the
sphere,
as
is there done:
an
investigation probably due
to
Theaetetus.
It
is
right
to
mention
here the remark in scholium No.
1
to
Eucl. XIII
that the book is about
'the
five so-called
Platonic
figures, which,
however, do not
belong
to
Plato,
three
of
the
five being due to the Pytha-
goreans,
namely
the
cube,
the
pyramid, and
the
dodeca-
hedron, while
the
octahedron
and
icosahedron
are due
to
Theaetetus '}
This statement (taken probably from Geminus) may per-
haps
rest on the fact that Theaetetus was the
first to write
at any length about the two last-mentioned solids, as he was
probably the
first
to construct
all five theoretically and
in-
vestigate fully their relations to one another and the circum-
scribing spheres.

Pythagorean astronomy.
Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans occupy an important place
in the history of astronomy.
(1 ) Pythagoras was one of the first
to maintain that the
universe and
the
earth
are
spherical
in form.
It
is uncertain what led Pythagoras
to
conclude
that the earth is a sphere.
One suggestion is that he inferred
it from the roundness
of
the shadow
cast by
the earth
in
eclipses of the' moon.
But
it
is certain that Anaxagoras was
the
first
to
suggest
this,
the
true,
explanation
of
eclipses.
The most likely supposition
is that Pythagoras's ground was
purely mathematical, or mathematico-aesthetical
; that
is, he
' Heiberg's Euclid, vol.
v, p. 654.

PYTHAGOREAN ASTRONOMY
163
attributed spherical shape
to the earth
(as
to the
universe)
for the simple reason that the sphere
is the most beautiful
of
solid
figures.
For
the
same
reason
Pythagoras
would
surely hold that the
sun, the moon, and the other heavenly
bodies are also spherical in shape.
(2) Pythagoras is credited
with having observed the identity
of the Morning and the
Evening
Stars.
(3)
It
is probable that he was the
first to
state
the view
(attributed
to Alcmaeon and
' some
of
the
mathematicians')
that
the
planets
as
well
as
the
sun and
moon have a motion of their own from west to east opposite
to and independent of the daily rotation of the sphere of the
fixed stars from east to west.^
Hermesianax, one of the older
generation of Alexandrine poets (about 300 B.C.), is quoted as
saying
:
' What inspiration
laid forceful hold on Pythagoras when
he discovered
the
subtle geometry of (the heavenly) spirals
and compressed in a small sphere the whole of the circle which
the aether embraces.' ^
This would seem
to imply
the
construction
of
a
sphere
on which were represented the circles described by the sun,
moon and planets together with the daily revolution of the
heavenly sphere
; but of course Hermesianax is not altogether
a trustworthy authority.
It
is improbable that Pythagoras himself was responsible
for the astronomical system known as the
Pythagorean,
in
which
the earth was deposed from
its
place
at
rest
in the
centre of the universe, and became a
' planet
', like the sun,
the moon and the other planets, revolving about the central
fire.
For Pythagoras the earth was
still at the centre, while
about
it there moved (a) the sphere of the fixed stars revolv-
ing
daily from
east
to
west,
the
axis
of
rotation being
a
straight
line through
the
centre of
the
earth,
(b) the
sun,
moon and planets moving in independent circular
orbits
in
a sense opposite to that of the daily rotation,
i. e. from west
to east.
The
later
Pythagorean
system
is
attributed by
Aetius
(probably on the authority of Theophrastus) to Philolaus, and

164
PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
may be
described
thus.
The universe
is
spherical
in shape
and finite in
size.
Outside
it
is infinite void which enables
the
universe
to
breathe, as
it
were.
At
the centre
is the
central
fire,
the Hearth
of
the Universe, called by
various
names,
the Tower
or Watch-tower
of
Zeus,
the Throne
of
Zeus, the House
of Zeus, the Mother of the Gods, the Altar,
Bond and Measure
of Nature.
In
this central fire is located
the governing principle, the force which directs the movement
and activity
of the universe.
In the universe there revolve
in circles about the central fire the following bodies.
Nearest
to the central
fire revolves the counter-earth, which always
accompanies the earth, the orbit of the earth coming next to
that
of the counter-earth;
next
to the
earth, reckoning
in
order from the centre outwards, comes the moon, next to the
moon the sun, next to the sun the
five planets, and
last of
all, outside the
orbits
of the
five
planets, the sphere
of the
fixed stars.
The counter-earth, which accompanies the earth
and
revolves
in a smaller
orbit,
is
not seen by us because
the hemisphere of the earth on which we live is turned away
from
the
counter- earth
(the
analogy
of
the moon
which
always turns one
side towards us may have suggested this)
this
involves, incidentally, a rotation of the earth about
its
axis completed
in
the same
time
as
it takes
the
earth
to
complete
a, revolution about the central
fire.
As the
latter
revolution of the
earth was held to produce day and night,
it
is
a natural
inference
that
the
earth was
supposed
to
complete one revolution round the central
fire in a day and
a night, or in. twenty-four hours.
This motion on the part of
the earth with our hemisphere always turned outwards would
of
course, be
equivalent,
as an
explanation
of
phenomena,
to a rotation
of the
earth
about a
fixed
axis, but for the
parallax consequent on the earth describing a circle
in
space
with radius greater than its own radius
;
this parallax,
if we
may trust
Aristotle,'^ the Pythagoreans boldly asserted to be
negligible.
The
superfluous
thing
in
this
system
is
the
introduction
of
the
counter-earth.
Aristotle
says
in
one
place
that
its
object was
to bring up
the number of the
moving
bodies
to
ten,
the
perfect
number
according
to
' Arist. De caelo,
ii. 13, 293 b 25-30.

PYTHAGOREAN ASTRONOMY
165
the Pythagoreans ^
; but he hints at the truer explanation in
another passage where
he
says
that
eclipses
of
the moon
were
considered
to be due sometimes
to
the
interposition
of the earth, sometimes to the interposition of the counter-
earth
(to
say
nothing
of
other
bodies
of
the
same
sort
assumed by 'some'
in
order
to explain why there
appear
to be more lunar
eclipses than
solar) ^
;
we may
therefore
take
it that the counter-earth was invented for the purpose
of explaining ecUpses of the moon and their frequency.
Recapitulation.
The astronomical systems of Pythagoras and the Pytha-
goreans illustrate the purely mathematical character of their
physical speculations
;
the heavenly
bodies
are
all
spheres,
the most perfect of solid
figures, and they move
in
circles
;
there
is no question raised
of forces causing the respective
movements
; astronomy
is pure mathematics,
it
is geometry,
combined
with
arithmetic and harmony.
The
capital
dis-
covery by Pythagoras of the dependence of musical intervals
on
numerical
proportions
led,
with
his
successors,
to
the
doctrine
of
the
'harmony
of
the
spheres'.
As
the
ratio
2
:
1 between
the
lengths of
strings
of the same substance
and
at
the
same
tension
corresponds
to
the
octave,
the
ratio
3
: 2
to the
fifth, and
the
ratio
4
: 3
to the
fourth,
it
was held that bodies moving in space produce sounds, that
those which move more quickly give a higher note than those
which move more slowly, while those move most quickly which
move
at
the
greatest
distance
;
the
sounds
therefore
pro-
duced by the heavenly
bodies, depending on
their distances
(i.e. the size of their orbits), combine to produce a harmony;
' the whole heaven is number and harmony '?
We have seen too how, with the Pythagoreans, the theory
of numbers, or
' arithmetic
', goes hand in hand with geometry
;
numbers are represented by dots or lines forming geometrical
figures
; the species of numbers often take their names from
their geometrical analogues, awhile their properties are proved
by geometry.
The Pythagorean mathematics, therefore, is all
one science, and their science is all mathematics.

PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
It
is this
identification of mathematics (and of geometry
in particular) with science in geijeral, and their pursuit of it
for
its own sake, which led to the extraordinary advance of
the subject in the Pythagorean school.
It was the great merit
of Pythagoras himself (apart from any particular geometrical
or arithmetical theorems which he discovered) that he was the
first to take this view of mathematics
;
it
is characteristic of
him that, as we are told,
' geometry was called by Pythagoras
inquiry or science
' (eKaXetro
Se
17
yeoo/jLeTpLa Trpoy Ilvdayopov
laTopia)}
Not only did he make geometry a liberal educa-
tion; he was the
first
to attempt to explore
it down to
its
first principles
; as part of the scientific basis which he sought
to lay down he
' used definitions
'.
A point was, according to
the Pythagoreans,
a
' unit having position
' ^
;
and,
if their
method of regarding a
line, a surface, a
solid, and an angle
does not amount to a
definition,
it at least shows that they
had reached a clear idea of the differentiae, as when they said
that
1. was a point, 2 a
line,
3 a
triangle, and 4 a pyramid.
A surface they called xpoid,
' colour
'
;
this was their way
of
describing
the
superficial
appearance,
the
idea
being,
as
Aristotle says, that the colour is either in the limiting surface
(nkpai) or is the nepas,^ so that the meaning intended to be
conveyed
is
precisely
that intended by
Euclid's
definition
(XI. Def. 2) that
' the limit of a solid is a surface '.
An angle
they called yXcoxi^, a
' point
' (as of an arrow) made by a line
broken or bent back at one point.*
The positive
achievements
of
the Pythagorean
school
in
geometry, and the immense advance made by them, will be
seen from the following summary.
1. They were
acquainted with
the
properties of
parallel
lines, which
they
used
for
the purpose
of
establishing by
a
general
proof
the
proposition
that the sum
of the three
angles- of any
triangle
is
equal
to two right angles.
This
latter proposition they again used to establish the well-known
theorems about the sums of the exterior and interior angles,
respectively, of any polygon.
2. They
originated
the
subject
of
equivalent
areas,
the
transformation of an area of one form into another of different

form and, in
particular, the whole method
of cqjplioation of
areas, constituting a geometrical algebra, whereby they effected
the equivalent of the algebraical processes of addition, sub-
traction,
multiplication, division, squaring, extraction of the
square
root, and finally the complete
solution
of the mixed
quadratic equation x^Â±pxÂ±q â€”
0, m far as its foots are real..
Expressed in terms of Euclid, this means the whole content of
Book
I. 35-48 and Book II.
The method of application of
areas
is one of the most fundamental in
the whole of later
Greek geometry
;
it takes its place by the side of the powerful
method of pi-oportions
;
moreover,
it is the starting point of
ApoUonius's
theory
of
conies,
and
the
three
fundamental
terms,
parabole,
ellipsis, and hyperbole used to describe the
three
separate problems in
'application' were actually em-
ployed
by
Apollonius
to
denote
the
three
conies,
names
which, of course, are those which we use to-day.
Nor was
the
use
of the
geometrical
algebra
for
solving
numerical
problems unknown to the Pythagoreans
;
this
is proved by
the
fact that the theorems
of Eucl.
II.
9, 10 were invented
for the purpose of finding successive integral solutions of the
indeterminate equations
2x^-y^= +1.
3. They had a theory of proportion pretty fully developed.
We know nothing of the form in which
it was expounded;
all we know
is that
it took no account of incommensurable
magnitudes.
Hence we
conclude
that
it was a
numerical
theory,
a
theory on
the
same
lines
as
that
contained
in
Book VII of Euclid's Elements.
They
were
aware
of
the
properties
of
similar
figures.
This
is
clear
from
the
fact
that
they must
be assumed
to
have
solved
the
problem,
which
was,
according
to
Plutarch, attributed
to Pythagoras
himself,
of describing
a
figure which shall be similar to one given figure and equal in
area
to another given figure.
This
implies a knowledge of
the proposition that similar figures (triangles or polygons) are
to one another in the duplicate ratio of corresponding
sides
(Eucl. VI. 19, 20).
As the problem
is solved in Eucl. VI. 25,
we
assume
that,
subject
to
the
qualification
that
theil-
theorems about similarity, &c., were only established of figures

168
.
PYTHAGOREAN GEOMETRY
in which corresponding elements are eonmiensurable, they had
theorems corresponding to a great part of EucL, Book VI.
Again, they knew how to cut a straight line in extreme and
mean
ratio
(Eucl. VI.
30);
this
problem
was
presumably
solved by the method used in Eucl.
II. 11, rather than by that
-of Eucl. VI. 30, which depends on
the
solution of a problem
in the application of areas more general than the methods of
Book
II
enable
us
to
solve,
the problem
namely of
Eucl.
VI.
29.
4. They had discovered, or were aware of the existence of,
the
five
regular
solids.
These they may have
constructed
empirically by putting together squares, equilateral triangles,
and
pentagons.
This
implies
that
they could
construct
a
regular pentagon and, as this construction depends upon the
construction of an isosceles triangle in which each of the base
angles
is double of the vertical angle, and this again on the
cutting of a line in extreme and mean
ratio, we may fairly
assume that this was the way in which the construction of
the regular pentagon was actually evolved.
It would follow
that the solution of problems by analysis was already prac-
tised by the Pythagoreans, notwithstanding that the discovery
of
the analytical method
is
attributed by Proclus
to Plato.
As the particular construction is practically given in Eucl. IV.
10, 11, we may assume that the content of Eucl. IV was
also
partly Pythagorean.
5. They discovered
the
existence
of the
irrational in the
sense that they proved the incommensurability of the diagonal
of a square with reference to its
side
; in other words, they
proved the irrationality of V2.
As a proof of this is referred
to by
Aristotle
in
terms which
correspond
to
the
method
used
in
a
proposition
interpolated
in
Euclid, Book
X, we
may conclude that this proof
is ancient, and therefore that it
was probably the proof used by the discoverers of the proposi-
tion.
The method is to prove that, if the diagonal of a square
is commensurable with the side, then the same number must
be both odd and even
; here then we probably have an early
Pythagorean use of the method of reductio ad ahsvurdnon.
Not only did the Pythagoreans
. discover the
irrationality
of -72
; they showed, as we have
seen, how
to approximate
as closely as we please to its numerical value.

RECAPITULATION
169
After
the
discovery
of
this one
case
of
irrationality,
it
would be
obvious
that
propositions
theretofore
proved
by
means
of
the
numerical
theory
of
proportion, which was
inapplicable
to incommensurable magnitudes, were only par-
tially proved.
Accordingly, pending the discovery of a theory
of proportion applicable to incommensurable as well as com-
mensurable
magnitudes,
there would be
an inducement
to
substitute, where possible, for proofs employing the theory of
proportions other
proofs independent of
that
theory.
This
substitution
is carried rather far in Euclid, Books I-IV
;
it
does not follow that the Pythagoreans remodelled their proofs
to the same extent as Euclid felt bound to do.

VI
PROGRESS IN THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO
PLATO'S TIME
In tracing the further progress in the Elements which took
place down to the time of Plato, we do not get much assistance
from
the summary
of
Proclus.
The
passage
in
which
he
states the succession of geometers from Pythagoras to Plato
and his contemporaries runs as follows
'After him [Pythagoras] Anaxagoras of Clazomenae dealt
with many questions
in geometry, and so did Oenopides
of
Chios, who was
a
little younger than Anaxagoras;
Plato
himself alludes,
in the
Rivals,
to both
of them
as
having
acquired a reputation
for
mathematics.
After them came
Hippocrates
of
Chios,
the
discoverer
of
the
quadrature
of
the
lune, and Theoddrus
of Cyrene, both of whom became
distinguished
geometers;
Hippocrates indeed was the
first
of whom
it
is recorded that he actually compiled Elements.
Plato, who came next to them, caused mathematics in general
and geometry in particular
to make
a very great advance,
owing to his own 'zeal for these studies; for every one knows
that he even
filled his writings with mathematical discourses
and strove on every occasion to arouse enthusiasm for mathe-
matics in those who took up philosophy.
At this time too
lived Leodamas of Thasos, Archytas of Taras, and Theaetetus
of Athens, by whom the number of theorems was increased
and a further advance was made towards a more
scientific
grouping of them.' ^
It will be seen that we have here little more than a list of
names
of
persons who advanced, or were
distinguished
in,
geometry.
There is no mention of specific discoveries made
by particular geometers, except that the work of Hippocrates
on
the squaring
of certain
lunes
is
incidentally alluded
to,
rather as a means
of identifying Hippocrates than as a
de-
tail relevant to the
subject in hand.
It would appear that
1 Proclus on Eucl.
I, p. 65. 21-66. 18.

THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
171
the whole sumnlary was directed to the one object
of trac-
ing
progress
in
the
Elements,
particularly
with
reference
to
improvements
of
method
in
the
direction
of
greater
generality and more
scientific
order and treatment;
henoe
only those writers are here mentioned who conti'ibuted to this
development.
Hippocrates ^omes into the
list, not because
of his
lunes, but because he was
a
distinguished geometer
and was the
first to write Elements.
Hippias of Elis, on the
other hand, though he belongs to the period covered by the
extract,
is
omitted, presumably because his great discovery,
that of the curve known as the quadratrix, does not belong
to elementary geometry; Hippias
is, however, mentioned
in
two other places by Proelus in connexion with the quadratrix,^
and once more as authority for the geometrical achievements
of Ameristus
(or Mamercus or Mamertius).^
Less justice
is
done to Democritus, who is neither mentioned here nor
else-
where
in the commentary;
the omission here of the name
of Democritus
is one
of
the arguments
for
the view
that
this
part' of
the summary
is not quoted from
the History
of Geometry by Eudemus (who would not have been likely to
omit
so accomplished a mathematician
as
Democritus), but
is the work either of an intermediary or of Proelus himself,
based indeed upon data from Eudemus's history, but limited to
particulars relevant
to
the
object
of the commentary,
that
is to say, {he elucidation of Euclid and the story of the growth
of the Elements.
There
are,
it
is
true,
elsewhere in
Proclus's commentary
a very few cases in which particular propositions
in
Euclid,
Book
I,
are
attributed
to
individual
geometers,
e.g.
those
which Thales
is
said to have
discovered.
Two propositions
presently to
be mentioned
are
in
like manner put
to
the
account
of
Oenopides;
but
except
for
these
details

THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
be described below.
Meantime we will take the names men-
tioned by Proclus in their order.
Anaxagoras (about 500-428 B.C.) was born at Clazomenae
in the neighbourhood of Smyrna.
He neglected
his posses-
sions, which were
considerable,
in
order
to
devote
himself
to
science.
Some one once asked him what was the
object
of being born, to which he replied,
' The investigation of sun,
moon and heaven.'
He was apparently the
first philosopher
to take up his abode at Athens, where he enjoyed the friend-
ship
of
Pericles.
When
Pericles became unpopular
shortly
before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, he was attacked
through his friends, and Anaxagoras was accused of impiety
for holding that the sun was a red-hot stone and the moon
earth.
According
to one account he was
fined
five
talents
and
banished;
another account
says
that
he was kept
in
prison and that
it was intended
to put him
to
death,
but
that
Pericles
obtained
his
release;
he
went and
lived
at
Lampsacus
till his death.
Little
or nothing
is known of Anaxagoras's achievements
in mathematics
proper, though
it
is
credible
enough
that
he was a good mathematician.
But in astronomy he made
one epoch-making
discovery,
besides
putting forward some
remarkably
original
theories
about
the
evolution
of
the
universe.
We owe
to him the
first clear recognition of the
fact
that
the moon
does
not
shine by
its own
light
but
receives
its light from the sun;
this discovery enabled him
to
give
the
true
explanation
of
lunar
and
solar
eclipses,
though
as
regards
the former
(perhaps
in order
to explain
their greater frequency) he erroneously supposed that there
were
other opaque and
invisible
bodies
' below
the moon
which, as well as the earth, sometimes by their interposition
caused eclipses of the moon.
A word should be added about
his cosmology on account of the fruitful ideas which
it con-
tained.
According to him the formation of the world began
with a vortex set up, in a portion of the mixed mass in which
'all
things were
together', by Mind
(uovs).
This
rotatory
movement began
in
the
centre and then
gradually
spread,
taking in wider and wider
circles.
The
first
effect was
to
separate two
great masses, one consisting
of
the
rai-e,
hot,
light,
dry,
called
the
'aether',
the
other
of
the
opposite

ANAXAGORAS
_
173
categories and called
'air'.
The aether took the
outer, the
air the inner. place.
From the air were next separated clouds,
water, earth and stones.
The dense, the moist, the dark and
cold, and all the heaviest things, collected in the centre as the
result of the circular motion, and
it was from these elements
when consolidated that the earth was formed
; but after this,
in
consequence
of the
violence
of the whirling motion, the
surrounding fiery aether tore stones away from the earth and
kindled them
into
stars.
Taking this
in conjunction
Avith
the remark that
stones
'rush
outwards more than
water',
we see that Anaxagoras conceived the idea
of a centrifugal
force as well as that of concentration brought about by the
motion of the vortex, and that he assumed a
series of pro-
jections or
' whirlings-off '
of precisely the same kind as the
theory
of Kant and Laplace assumed
for the formation of
the solar system.
At the same time he held that one of the
heavenly bodies might break away and fall (this may account
for the story that he prophesied the fall of the meteoric stone
at Aegospotami in 468/7
B.C.), a centripetal tendency being
here recognized.
In
mathematics we are
told
that Anaxagoras
'while
in
prison wrote
(or drew,
(ypacpe) the squaring of the
circle '.^
But we have no means
of judging what this amounted
to.
Rudio translates
'eypa<f)â‚¬ as
' zeiehnete
',
' drew
', observing that
he probably knew the Egyptian rule for squaring, and simply
drew on the sand a square as nearly as he could equal to the
area of a circle.^
It
is clear to me that this cannot be right,
but that the word means
' wrote upon
' in the sense that he
tried to work out theoretically the problem in question.
For
the same word
occurs
(in the
passive)
in the extract from
Eudemus about Hippocrates
:
' The squarings of the lunes
.
.
.
were first written (or proved) by Hippocrates and were found
to be
correctly expounded',^ where
the context shows that
kypd(f)rj<Tav
cannot
merely mean
' were
drawn
'.
Besides,
TfTpaycoi'Lcrfios, squaring,
is a process or operation, and you
cannot, properly speaking,
' draw
'
a process, though you can
' describe
' it or prove its correctness.

174 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO
PLATO'S TIME
Vitruvius tells us that one Agatharchus was the first to paint
stage-scenes
at
Athens,
at 'the
time when Aeschylus
was
having his tragedies performed, and that he left a treatise on
the subject which was afterwards a guide to Democritus and
Anaxagoras, who discussed the same problem, namely that of
painting objects on a plane surface in such a way as to maise
some of the things depicted appear to be in the background
while others appeared to stand out in the foreground, so that
you seemed, e.g., to have
real buildings before you
;
in other
words, Anaxagoras and Democritus both wrote
treatises on
perspective.^
There
is not much
to
be
gathered from
the
passage
in
the Rivals to which Proclus refers.
Socrates, on entering the
school of Dionysius, finds two lads disputing a certain point,
something about Anaxagoras or Oenopides, he was not certain
which
; but they appeared to be drawing
circles, and
to be
imitating
certain
inclinations by placing
their hands
at an
angle.^
Now
this
description
suggests
that what
the
lads
were trying to represent was the
circles of the equator and
the zodiac or
ecliptic
; and we know that in
fact Eudemus
in his History of Astronomy attributed to Oenopides the dis-
covery of
' the cincture of the zodiac circle ',^ which must mean
the discovery of the obliquity of the ecliptic.
It would prob-
ably be unsafe to conclude that Anaxagoras was also credited
with the same discovery, but it certainly seems to be suggested
that Anaxagoras had to some extent touched the mathematics
of astronomy.
Oenopides of Chios was primarily an astronomer.
This
is shown not only by the reference of Eudemus just cited, but
by a remark of Proclus in connexion with one of two proposi-
tions in elementary geometry attributed to him.*
Eudemus
is quoted as saying that he not only discovered the obliquity
of the
ecliptic, but also the period of a Great Year.
Accord-
ing to Diodorus the Egyptian priests claimed that it was from
them that Oenopides learned that the sun move's in an inclined
orbit and in a sense opposite to the motion of the fixed
stars.
It does not appear that Oenopides made any meaaurement of
' Vitruvius, De architectura, vii. praef. 11.

* Proclus on Eucl.
I, p. 283. 7-8.

OENOPIDES OF CHIOS
175
the obliquity of the ecHptic.
The duration of the Great Year
he
is said to have put at 59 years, while he made the length
of the year itself to be 365|| days.
His Great Year clearly
had reference to the sun and moon only
; he merely sought to
find the least integral number of complete years which would
contain an exact number of lunar months.
Starting, probably,
with 365 days as the length of a year and 29^ days as the
length of a lunar month, approximate values known before
his time, he would see that twice 29|, or 59, years would con-
tain twice 365, or 730, lunar months.
He may then, from his
knowledge of the calendar, have obtained 21,557 as the num-
ber of days in 730 months, for 21,557 when dividedby 59 gives
365-II as the number of days in the year.
Of Oenopides's geometry we have no
details, except that
Proclus attributes to him two propositions in Eucl. Bk.
I.
Of
I. 12
(' to draw a perpendicular to a given
straight
line from
a point outside it ') Proclus says
:
'This problem was
first
investigated
by Oenopides, who
thought
it useful for astronomy.
He, however, calls the per-
pendicular
in
the
archaic
manner
(a
straight
line drawn)
gnomon-wise {Kara
yvdofiova), because the gnomon
is also at
right angles to the horizon.'
^
On
I. 23
(' on a given straight line and at a given point on
it to construct a rectilineal angle equal to a given rectilineal
angle
') Proclus remarks that this problem is
' rather the dis-
covery of Oenopides, as Eudemus says '.^
It is clear that the
geometrical reputation of Oenopides could not have rested on
the mere solution of such simple problems as these.
Nor, of
course, could he have been the first to draw a perpendicular in
practice
; the point may be that he was the first to solve the
problem by means of the ruler and compasses only, whereas
presumably, in
earlier days, perpendiculars would be drawn
by means of a set square or a right-angled triangle originally
constructed, say, with sides proportional to
3,
4,
5.
Similarly
Oenopides may have been the
first
to give
the
theoretical,
rather than the practical, construction for the problem of I. 23
which we find in Euclid.
It may therefore be that Oenopides's
significance lay in improvements of method from the point of
view of theory
; he may, for example, have been the
first to

I, p. 288. 7-8.

THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
lay clown the restriction oÂ£ the means permissible in construc-
tions to the ruler and
compasses which became a canon of
Greek
geometry
for
all
' plane
'
constructions,
i.e.
for
all
problems involving the equivalent of the solution of algebraical
equations of degree not higher than the second.
Democeitus, as mathematician, may be said to have at last
come into
his own.
In the Method
of Archimedes, happily
discovered in 1906, we are told that Democritus was the first
to state the important propositions that the volume of a cone
is one third of that of a cylinder having the same base and
equal height, and that the volume of a pyramid is one third of
that of a prism having the same base and equal height
; that is
to
say, Democritus enunciated these propositions some
fifty
years or more before they were
first scientifically proved by
Eudoxus.
Democritus came from Abdera, and, according to his own
account, was young when Anaxagoras was
old.
Apollodorus
placed his birth in
01. 80 (= 460-457
B.C.), while according
to Thrasyllus he was born in 01. 77.
3 (= 470/69
B.C.), being
one year older than
Socrates.
He
lived
to a great
age, 90
according
to
Diodorus,
104,
108,
109
according
to
other
authorities.
He
was
indeed,
as
Thrasyllus
called
him,
v-efTaOXos in philosophy^
; there was no subject to which he
did not notably contribute, from mathematics and physics on
the one hand to ethics and poetics- on the other
; he even went
by the name of
' Wisdom
' {'So<pia)}
Plato, of course, ignores
him throughout his dialogues, and
is said to have wished
to
burn
all
his
works;
Aristotle,
on
the
other
hand,
pays
handsome tribute to
his genius, observing,
e.g., that on the
subject
of change and growth no one save Democritus had
observed anything except superficially; whereas Democritus
seemed
to
have
thought
of
everything.^
He
could
say
of
himself
(the fragment
is,
it
is
true, considered by Diels
to be
spurious, while Gomperz held
it
to be
genuine),
' Of
all my contemporaries
I have covered
the most ground
in
my travels, making the most exhaustive inquiries the while
;
I have seen the most climates and countries and listened to

DEMOCRITUS
177
the greatest number of learned men '}
His travels lasted for
five years, and he
is said
to have visited Egypt, Persia and
Babylon, where he consorted with the priests and magi
; some
say that he went to India and Aethiopia also.
Well might
he
undertake the compilation
of
a
geographical survey
of
the
earth
as, after Anaximander, Hecataeus
of Miletus and
Damastes of Sigeum had done.
In his lifetime his fame was
far from world-wide
:
' I came
to Athens
', he
says,
' and no
one knew me.' ^
A long lift of his writings is preserved in Diogenes Laertius,
the
authority
being
Thrasyllus.
In
astronomy
he
wrote,
among other works, a book On the Planets, and another On
the
Great
Year or Astronomy
including a jjara^xgma^
(or
calendar).
Democritus made the ordei: of the heavenly bodies,
reckoning
outwards from
the
earth,
the
following:
Moon,
Venus, Sun, the other planets, the fixed stars.
Lucretius * has
preserved an interesting explanation which he gave
of the
reason why the sun takes a year to describe the full circle of
the
zodiac, while the moon corripletes
its
circle
in a month.
The nearer any body is to the earth (and therefore the farther
from the sphere of the fixed stars) the
less swiftly can
it be
carried round by the
revolution
of
the
heaven.
Now
the
moon is nearer than the
sun, and the sun than the signs of
the zodiac
; therefore the nioon seems to get round faster than
the sun
because, while
the
sun, being lower and therefore
slower than
the
signs,
is. left behind by them, the moon,
being
still lower and therefore slower
still,
is
still more
left
behind.
Democritus's Great Year is described by Censorinus
as
82 (LXXXII) years including 28 intercalary months, the
latter number being the same as that included by Callippus in
his cycle of 76 years;
it
is therefore probable that LXXXII
is an incorrect reading for LXXVII (77).
As regards his mathematics we have first the statement in
o
1 Clement, Strom,
i. 15, 69 (Vors. n\ p. 128.
3).
2 Diog. L. ix. 36 (Vors. iiS p.

' The ixirapegma was a posted record, a kind of almanac, giving, for
a series of years, the movements of the sun, the dates of the phases of
the moon, the risings and
settings of certain stars,
besides

;
many
details from
Democritus's parapegma
are preserved

178 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
the
continuation
of
the fragment
of
doubtful
authenticity
already quoted that
' in the putting together of lines, with the necessary proof, no
one has yet surpassed me, not even the so-called hurpeclon-
aptae (rope-stretchers) of Egypt
'.
This
does
not
tell us much,
except
that
it
indicates
that
the
' rope-stretchers
',
whose
original
function
was
land-
measuring or
practical geometry, had by Democritus's time
advanced some way in theore"tical geometry (a fact which the
surviving documents, such as the book of Ahmes, with their
merely practical rules, would not have enabled us to
infer).
However,
there
is
no reasonable doubt
that
in
geometry
Democritus was fully abreast
of the knowledge of
his day;
this
is
fully confirmed by the titles of treatises by him and
from other sources.
The titles of the works classed as mathe-
matical are (besides the astronomical works above mentioned)
1. On a difference of opinion
{yvS/irjs:
v.
I. yuco/xovo?, gno-
mon), or on the contact of a circle and a sphere ;
2. On Geometry
;
3.
GeometricoruTn
(i I, II)
;
4. Numbers;
5. On irrational lines and solids {yaarraiv, atoms ?);
6.
'EKTrerda-fiaTa.
As
regards
the
first
of
these
works
I
think
that
the
attempts to extract a sense out of Cobet's reading yvwfiovo^
(on a difference of a gnomon) have
failed, and that
yvrnfi-q^
(Diels)
is
better.
But
' On
a
difference
of
opinion
' seems
scarcely determinative enough, if this was really an alternative
title to the book.
We know that there were controversies in
ancient times about the nature of the
' angle of contact
' (the
'angle' formed, at the
point of contact, between an
arc
of
a
circle and the tangent
to
it, which angle was called by the
special name
hornlike,
KeparoeiSri^), and the 'angle' comple-
mentary to it (the
' angle of a semicircle ')}
The question was
whether the
' hornlike angle
' was a magnitude comparable
with the
rectilineal
angle,
i.e. whether by being
multiplied
a
sufiicient number of times
it could be made to exceed a
' Proclus on Eucl.
I, pp. 121. 24-122. 6.

DEMOCRITUS
179
given
rectilineal angle.
Euclid proved
(in
III. 16)
that the
' angle of contact
' is
less than any rectilineal angle, thereby
setting the question at
rest.
This
is the only reference in
Euclid to this angle and the
' angle of a semicircle', although
he defines the
' angle of a segment
'
in
III,
Def.
7, and has
statements about the angles o/ segments in
III. 31.
But we
know from a passage of Aristotle that before his time
' angles
of segments
' came into geometrical text-books as elements in
figures which could be used in the proofs of propositions
>
;
thus
e.g.
the
equality
of
the
two
angles
of
a
segment
(assumed
as known)
was
used
to
prove
the
theorem
of
Eucl.
I.
5.
Euclid abandoned the use
of
all such angles in
proofs, and the references to them above mentioned are only
survivals.
The controversies doubtless arose long before
his
time, and
such a question
as
the nature
of the contact of
a circle with
its tangent would probably have a fascination
for Democritus, who, as we shall see, broached other questions
involving
infinitesimals.
As,
therefore, the questions
of the
nature of the contact of a circle with
its tahgent and of the
character
of
the
' hornlike
'
angle
are obviously
connected,
I prefer to read ywvir]^
{' of an angle ') instead of yvd/x-qi
; this
would give the perfectly comprehensible title,
' On a difference
in an angle, or on the contact of a circle and a sphere'.
We
know from Aristotle that Protagoras, who wrote a book on
mathematics, mpl Ta>v fiaOr^fiaTaiv, used against the geometers
the
argument
that
no
such
straight
lines
and
circles
as
they assume exist in nature, and that
(e. g.) a material' circle
does not in actual fact touch a ruler at one point only 2; and
it seems probable that Democritus's work was directed against
this sort of attack on geometry.
We know nothing
of the
contents
of Democritus's book
On Geometry or of
his
Geometrica.
One
or other
of
these
works may possibly have contained the famous dilemma about
sections of a cone parallel to the base and very close together,
which Plutarch gives on the authority of Chrysippus.^
' If, said Democritus, 'a cone werp cut by a plane parallel
to the base
[by which
is clearly meant a plane

180 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
near to the base], what must we think of the surfaces forming
the sections ?
Are they equal or unequal ?
For,
if they are
unequal, they will make the cone irregular as having many
indentations,
like
steps, and unevennesses
;
but,
if they
are
equal, the
sections will be equal, and the cone will appear to
have the property of the cylinder and to be made up of equal,
not unequal, circles, which
is very absurd.'
The
phrase 'onade
%hp
of
equal
.
.
.
circles' shows
that
Democritus already had the idea of a solid being the sum of
an
infinite
number
of
parallel
planes,
or
indefinitely thin
laminae,
indefinitely near
together
:
a
most
important
an-
ticipation
of
the same thought which
led
to such
fruitful
results in Archimedes.
This idea may be at the root of the
argument by which Democritus satisfied himself of the truth
of
the two propositions attributed
to him by
Archimedes,
namely that a
cone
is one third part
of the
cylinder, and
a pyramid one third of the prism, which has the same base
and equal height.
For
it
seems
probable
that Democritus
would notice
that,
if two pyramids having the same height
and
equal
. triangular
bases
are
respectively
cut by planes
parallel
to the base and
dividing the
heights
in the same
ratio,
the
corresponding
sections
of
the
two pyramids
are
equal, whence he would infer that the pyramids are equal as
being the sum of
the same
infinite number
of
equal
plane
sections or indefinitely thin laminae.
(This would be a par-
ticular anticipation of Cavalieri's proposition that the areal or
solid content of two figures
is equal
if two sections of them
taken at the same height, whatever the height may be, always
give equal straight lines or equal surfaces respectively.)
And
Democritus would of course see that the three pyramids into
which a prism on the same base and of equal height with the
original pyramid
is divided
(as in
Eucl. XII.
7)
satisfy this
test of equality, so that the pyramid would be one third part
of the prism.
The extension to a pyramid with a polygonal
base would be
easy.
And Democritus may have
stated the
proposition for the cone (of course without an absolute proof)
as a natural inference from the result of increasing indefinitely
the number of sides in a regular polygon forming the base of
a pyramid.
Tannery notes the interesting fact that. the order in the
list

DEMOCRITUS
181
of Democritus's works of the teeatises
ii Geovietry, Geometrica.
Numbers, and On irrational lines and
solids corresponds to
the order of the separate sections of Euchd's Elements, Books
I-VI
(plane
geometry),
Books VII-IX
(on numbers),
and
Book X (on irrationals).
With regard to the work On irra-
tional lines and solids it
is to be observed that, inasmuch as
his
investigation
of the cone had brought
Delnocritus
con-
sciously
face
to
face with
infinitesimals,
there
is
nothing
surprising in his having written on irrationals; on the con-
trary, the subject
is one in which he would be likely to take
special interest.
It is useless to speculate on what the treatise
actually contained
; but of one thing we may be sure, namely
that the dXoyoi
ypafifiai, 'irrational
lines', were not
drofioi
ypajifiai,
'indivisible
lines '.^
Democritus was
too
good
a
mathematician
to have anything to do with such a theory.
We do not know what answer he gave to his puzzle about the
cone
; but
his
statement
of the dilemma shows that he was
fully alive to the
difficulties connected with the conception of
the continuous
as
illustrated by the particular
case, and he
cannot have solved
it, in a sense analogous
to his physical
theory of atoms, by assuming indivisible
lines, for this would
have
involved
the
inference
that
the
consecutive
parallel
sections
of the cone are uixequal, in which case the
surface
would (as he said) be discontinuous, forming steps, as it were.
Besides, we are told by Simphcius
that, according to Demo-
critus
himself,
his
atoms
were,
in
a
mathematical
sense
divisible further and in fact ad infinitum,^ while the scholia
to
Aristotle's De
caelo
implicitly
deny
to
Democritus any
theory of
indivisible
lines
:

182 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
HiPPiAS OF Elis, the famous sophist already mentioned (pp. 2,
23-4), was nearly contemporary with Socrates and Prodicus,
and was probably born about 460 B.C.
Chronologically, there-
fore, his place would be here, but the only particular discovery
attributed
to him
is that of the curve afterwards known as
the quadratrix, and the qvadratrix does not come within the
scope of the Elements.
It was used
first for trisecting any
rectihneal, angle
or, more
genei-ally,
for dividing
it
in any
ratio whatever, and secondly for squaring the circle, or rather
for finding the length of any arc of a circle
; and these prob-
lems are not what
the Greeks
called
' plane
' problems,
i. e.
they cannot be solved by means
of the ruler and compasses.
It
is
true
that
some
have
denied
that
the
Hippias who
invented
the
quadratrix
can
have
been
Hippias
of
Elis
;
Blass ^ and Apelt ^ were of this opinion, Apelt arguing that at
the time
of Hippias geometry had
not
got
far beyond the
theorem of Pythagoras.
To show how wide of the mark this
last statement
is we have only to think of the achievements
of
Democritus.
We
know,"
too,
that
Hippias
the
sophist
specialized
in
mathematics, and
I
agree
with
Cantor
and
Tannery that there
is no reason to doubt that it was he who
discovered the quadratrix.
This curve will be best described
when we come to deal with the problem of squaring the circle
(Chapter VII)
; here we need only remark that
it implies the
proposition that thelengths of arcs in a circle are proportional
to the angles subtended by them at the centre (Eucl. VI. 33).
The most important name from the point
of view of
this
chapter
is Hippocrates of Chios.
He
is indeed
the
first
person
of whom
it
is
recorded that he compiled a book
of
Elements.
This
is
lost, but Simplicius has preserved in his
commentary on
the
Physics
of
Aristotle
a
fragment
from
Eudemus's History of Geometry giving an account of Hippo-
crates's quadratures of certain
' lunules
' or lunes.^
This is one
of the most precious sources for the liistory of Greek geometry
before Euclid
; and, as the methods, with one slight apparent
exception, are those
of the
straight
line and
circle, we can
form a good idea of the progress which had been made in the
Elements up to Hippocrates's time.

HIPPOCRATES OF CHIOS
183
It would appear that
Hippocrates was
in Athens during
a considerable portion of the second half o& the fifth century,
perhaps from 450 to 4^0 B.C.
We have quoted the story that
what brought him there was a suit
to recover a large sum
which he had
lost,
in the
course of his trading
operations,
' through falling in with pirates
; he
is said to have remained
in Athens on this account a long time, during which he con-
sorted with
the
philosophers and reached such a degree of
proficiency in geometry that he tried to discover a method of
squaring
the
circle.i
This
is
of
course an
allusion
to
the
quadratures of lunes.
Another important discovery is attributed
to Hipppcraites.
He was the first to observe that the problem of doubling the
cube is reducible to that of finding two mean proportionals in
continued proportion between two straight hnes.^
The effect
of
this
was,
as
Proclus
says,
that
thenceforward
people
addressed themselves (exclusively) to the equivalent problem
of finding two mean proportionals between two straight lines.*

I will now give the details of the extract from Eudemus on
the
subject
of Hippocrates's quadrature
of
lunes, which
(as
I have indicated)
I place in
this chaptet because
it belongs
to elementary
' plane
' geometry.
Simplicius
says
he
will
quote Eudemus
' word for word
' (Kara Ae^tc) except for a few
additions taken from
Euclid's Elevients, which he will insert
for
clearness' sake, and which are indeed necessitated by the
summary (memorandum-like)
style of Eudemus, whose form
of statement is condensed,
' in accordance with ancient prac-
tice'.
We have
therefore
in
the
first
place
to
distinguish
between what
is textually quoted from Eudemus and what
Simplicius has added.

came

of
Simplicius's commentary

the
Physics edited by Diels (1882), Avho, with the help of Usener,
separated out, and marked by spacing, the portions which they
regarded as Eudemus's own.
Tannery,^ who had contributed
to
the
preface
of
Diels
some
critical
observations,
edited
(in 1883), with a translation and notes, what he judged to be
Eudemian (omitting the rest).
Heiberg^ reviewed the whole
question
in
1884;
and
finally Rudio,^
after giving
in
the
Blhliotheca Mathematica of 1902 a translation of the whole
passage
of
Simplicius with elaborate
notes, which again he
followed up by other articles in the same journal and elsewhere
in 1903 and
1905, has edited the Greek
text, with a transla-
tion, introduction, notes, and appendices, and summed up the
whole controversy.
The occasion of the whole disquisition
in Simplicius's com-
mentary is a remark by Aristotle that there
is no obligation
on the part of the exponent of a particular subject to refute
a fallacy connected with
it
unless the author of the
fallacy
has based his argument on the admitted principles
. lying at
the root of the subject in question.
' Thus
', he says,
' it is for
the geometer to refute the (supposed) quadrature of a circle by
means of segments (TfJ-rifjidTcoi/), but it is not the business of the
geometer to refute the argument of Antiphon.'*
Alexander
took the remark to refer to Hippocrates's attempted quadra-
ture by means of lunes (although in that case Turjfia
is used
by Aristotle, not in the technical sense of a segoneiit, but with
the non-technical meaning of any portion cut out of a figure).
This, probable enough in itself
(for in another place Aristotle
uses the same word T/xfJua
to denote a sector of a
circle '), is
made practically certain by two other
allusions
in Aristotle,
one
to a
proof that a
circle together with
certain lunes
is
equal to a rectilineal figure,* and the other to
' the (fallacy) of
Hippocrates or the quadrature by means of the lunes 'J

HIPPOCRATES'S QUADRATURE OF LUNES
185
two expressions separated by
' or
' may no doubt refer not to
one but to two different
fallacies.
But if
' the quadrature by
means of lunes
' is different from Hippocrates's quadratures of
lunes, it must apparently be some quadrature like the second
quoted by Alexander (not by Eudemus), and the fallacy attri-
buted to Hippocrates must be the quadrature of a certain lune
2jIus a circle (which in itself contains no fallacy at all).
It seems
more likely that the two expressions refer to one thing, and that
this is the argument of Hippocrates's tract taken as a whole.
The ^passage
of
Alexander
which
Simplicius
reproduces
before
passing
to
the
extract from Eudemus
contains two
simple cases of quadrature, of a lune, and of lunes plus a semi-
circle
respectively, with an erroneous
inference from
these
cases that a circle is thereby squared.
It
is evident that this
account does not represent Hippocrates's own argument, for he
would not have been capable
of committing
so
obvious an
error
; Alexander must have drawn his information, not from
Eudemus, but from some other source.
Simplicius recognizes
this, for, after giving the alternative account extracted from
Eudemus, he says that we must trust Eudemus's account rather
than the
other,
since Eudemus was 'nearer the
times'
(of
Hippocrates).
<
The two quadratures given by Alexander are as follows.
1. Suppose that AB is the diameter of a circle, B its centre,
and
AC, GB
sides
of
a
square
inscribed in
it.
^'
On AC
as
diameter
describe
the semicircle AEC.
Join CD.
Now, since
AB^= 2AG\
A
D
B
and
circles
(and
therefore semi-
circles) are to one another as the squares on their diameters,
(semicircle ACB) = 2 (semicircle AEC).
But
(semicircle ACB) â€” 2 (quadrant A DC)
;
therefore
(semicircle AEG)= (quadrant ADC).
If now we
subtract the common part, the segment AFC,
we have
(lune AEGF) ^ A ADC,
and the lune is
' squared
'.

186 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
2. Next take three consecutive sides GE, EF, FD of a regular
hexagon inscribed in a circle of diameter GD.
Also take AB
equal to the radius of the circle and therefore equal to each of
the sides.
â€¢
On AB, GE, EF, FD as diameters describe
semicircles
(in
the last three cases outwards with reference to the circle).
Then, since
CD^ = 4^52 = AF' + GE^ + EF'' + FB-,
and
circles
are
to
one
another
as
the
squares
on
their
diameters,
semicircle CEFD) = 4 (semicircle ALB)
= (sum of semicircles ALB, GGE, EEF, FED).
H
Subtracting from each
side the sum of the small segments
on GE, EF, FD, we have
(trapezium GEFD) = (sum of three lunes) + (semicircle ALB).
The author goes on to say that, subtracting the rectilineal
figure equal to the three lunes
(' for a rectilineal figure was
proved
equal
to a
lune'), we
get
a
rectilineal
figure
equal
to
the
semicircle ALB,
'and
so
the
circle
will have
been
squared
'.
This conclusion is obviously false, and, as Alexander says,
the fallacy is in taking what was proved only of the lune on
the side of the inscribed square, namely that it can be squared,
to be true of the lunes on the
sides of an inscribed regular
hexagon.
It is impossible that Hippocrates (one of the ablest
of geometers) could have made such a blunder.
We turn there-
fore
to Eudemus's
account, which has every appearance
of
beginning
at the beginning of Hippocrates's work and pro-
ceeding in his order.

HIPPOCRATES'S QUADRATURE OF LUNES
187
It
is. important from the point of view of this chapter to
preserve the
phraseology
of
Eudemus, which
throws
light
on
the question how far
the
technical
terms
of
Euclidean
geometry were already used hy Eudemus
(if not by Hippo-
crates)
in their technical
sense.
I
shall
therefore
translate
literally
so much
as
can
safely be
attributed
to Eudemiis
himself, except in purely geometrical work, where I shall use
modern symbols.
' The quadratures of lunes, which were considered to belong
to an uncommon
class
of
propositions
on
account
of
the
close relation
(of lunes) to the
circle, were
first investigated
by
Hippocrates, and
his
exposition was thought
to
be
in
correct form ^
; we will therefore
deal with them at length
and describe them.
He
started with, and laid down as the
first
of the theorems useful for his purpose, the proposition
that similar segments of circles have the same ratio to one
another as the squares on their bases have
[lit. as their bases
in
square,
Svvdnei].
And
this he proved by
first showing
that the squares on the diameters have the same ratio as the
circles.
I For, as the
circles are to one another, so also are
similar segments of them.
For
similar segments are
those
which are
the same part of the
circles respectively, as
foi;
instance a
semicircle
is similar
to a
semicircle,, and a third
part of a circle to a third part [here, Rudio argues, the word
segments,
r/iijfiaTa, would seem
to be used
in the sense of
sectors].
It
is
for
this
reason
also
(Sib
kol)
that
similar
segments contain equal angles [here
' segments
' are certainly
segments in the usual sense].
The angles of
all semicircles
are right, those of segments greater than a semicircle are less
than right angles and are less in proportion as the segments
are greater than semicircles, while those of segments less than
a semicircle are greater than right angles and are greater in
proportion as tte segments are less than semicircles.'
j
I have put the
last sentences of this quotation in dotted
brackets
because
it
is matter
of
controversy whether they
belong to the original extract from Eudemus or were added by
Simplicius.
I think
I
shall bring
out the
issues
arising
out
of
this
passage into the clearest relief if I take as my starting-point
the
interpretation
of
it by Rudio,
the
editor
of the
latest
1 Kara Tponov
(' werfchvolle Abhandlung ', Heib.).

188 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
edition of the whole extract.
Whereas Dials, Usener, Tannery,
and Heiber^r had all seen in the sentences
' For, as the circles
are
to one another
.
.
. less than semicircles' an addition by
Simplicius, like the phrase just preceding (not quoted above),
' a proposition which Euclid placed second in his twelfth book
with the enunciation " Circles are to one another as the squares
on their diameters
"
', Rudio maintains that the sentences are
wholly
Eudemian,
because
' For,
as
the
circles
are
to
one
another, so are the similar segments
' is obviously connected
with the proposition that similar segments are as the squares
on
their bases a few
lines back.
Assuming, then,
that
the
sentences are Eudemian, Rudio bases
his next argument on
the sentence defining similar segments,
' For similar segments
are those which are the same part of the circles
: thus a semi-
circle is similar to a semicircle, and a third part (of one circle)
to a third part (of another circle)
'.
He argues that a
' segment
in the proper sense which is one third, one fourth, &c., of the
circle is not a conception likely to have been introduced into
Hippocrates's
discussion, because
it cannot be visuaHzed by
actual construction, and so would not have conveyed any clear
idea.
On the other hand,
if we divide the four rieht angles
about the centre
of a
circle
into
3,
4, or n equal
parts by
means of
3,
4, or n radii, we have an obvious division of the
circle into equal parts Avhich would occur- to any one
; that
is,
any one would understand the expression
one third or one
fourth
part
of
a
circle
if
the
parts were
sectors and
not
segments.
(The use of the word
Tnfjfj.a in the sense of sector
is
not
impossible
in
itself
at
a
date
when
mathematical
terminology was
not
finally
fixed; indeed
it means
'sector'
in one passage of Aristotle.^)
Hence Rudio will have
it that
'similar segments' in the second and third places in our passage
are
' similar sectors
'.
But the
' similar segments
' in the funda-
mental proposition of Hippocrates enunciated just before are
certainly segments in the proper sense
;
so are those
in the
next sentence which says that similar segments contain equal
angles.
There
is,
therefore,
the very great
difiiculty
that,
under
Rudio's
interpretation,
the
word
r/i-qnara
used
in
successive sentences means,
first segments, then
sectors, and
then segments again.
However, assuming this to be so, Rudio
i
' Arist. De caelo, ii. 8, 290 a 4.

HIPPOCRATES'S QUADRATURE OF LUNES
189
is able to make the argument hang together, in the following-
way.
The next sentence says,
' For this reason also
(Stb koI)
similar segments contain equal angles
'
; therefore this must be
inferred from the fact that similar sectors are the same part
of the respective circles.
The intermediate steps are not given
in the text;
but,
since the similar sectors are the same part
of the circles, they contain equal angles, and it follows that the
angles in
the segments which form part
of the
sectors
are
equal,
since they
are
the
supplements
of the halves
of the
angles of the
sectors respectively
(this inference presupposes
that Hippocrates knew the theorems of Eucl. III. 20-22, which
is indeed clear from other passages in the Eudemus extract).
Assuming this to be the line of argument, Rudio infers that in
Hippocrates's time
similar segments were not defined as
in
Euclid (namely as segments containing equal angles) but were
regarded as the segments belonging to
' similar sectors
', which
would thus be the prior conception.
Similar
sectors would
be sectors having their angles equal.
The sequence of ideas,
then, leading up to Hippocrates's proposition would be
this.
Circles are to one another as the squares on their diameters or
radii.
Similar sectors, having their angles equal, are to one
another as the whole circles to which they belong.
(Euclid has
not this proposition, but it
is included in Theon's addition to
VI.
33,
and
would
be known
long
before
Euclid's
time.)
Hence
similar sectors
are as the squares on the
radii.
But
so are the triangles formed by joining the extremities of the
bounding
radii
in each
sector.
Therefore
(cf.
Eucl.
V.
19)
the
diiferences
between
the
sectors
and
the
corresponding
triangles respectively,
i.e. the corresponding segments, are
in
the same
ratio
as
(1) the
similar
sectors,
or
(2)
the similar
triangles, and therefore are as the squares on the radii.
We could no doubt accept this version subject to three ifs,
(1)
if
the
passage
is
Eudemian,
(2)
if we
could
suppose
TixriiiaTa to be used in different senses in consecutive senteneeg
without a word of explanation, (3)
if the omission of the step
between the definition of similar
' segments
' and the inference
that the angles in similar segments
are equal could be put
down
to Eudemus's
' sumniary
'
style.
The second
of
these
ifs
is the
crucial one
; and, after
full reflection,
I
feel bound
to
agree
with
the
great
scholars who have
held
that
thih

190 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
hypothesis
is impossible; indeed the canons of literary criti-
cism seem to exclude
it altogether.
If this
is
so, the whole
of Rudio's elaborate structure falls to the ground.
We can now consider the whole question ah initio.
First,
are
the
sentences
in
. question
the words
of Eudemus
or of
Simplicius ?
On the one hand, I think the whole paragraph
would be much more like the
' summary
' manner of Eudemus
if it stopped at 'have the same ratio as the
circles', i.e. if the
sentences were not
there
at
all.
Taken
together, they are
long and
yet
obscurely
argued,
while
the
last
sentence
is
really
otiose,
and,
I
should
have
said,
quite unworthy
of
Eudemus.
On the other hand,
I do not see that Simplicius
had any sufficient motive for interpolating such an explana-
tion
: he might have added the words
' for, as the circles are
to one
another,
so
also
are
similar segments of them
',
but
there was no
need
for him
to
define
similar segments
;
he
must
have
been
familiar
enough
with
the
term
and
its
meaning to take
it for granted that his readers would know
them too.
I think, therefore, that the sentences, down to
' the
same part
of
the
circles
respectively'
at any
rate, may
be
from Eudemus.
In these sentences, then, can
' segments
' mean
segments
in
the
proper
sense
(and
not
sectors)
after
all ?
The argument that
it cannot rests on the assumption that the
Greeks of Hippocrates's day would not bfe likely to speak of
a segment which was one third
of the whole
circle
if they
did not see their way to visualize
it by actual construction.
But, though the idea would be of no use to us,
it does not
follow that
their point
of view would be the same as
ours.
On the contrary, I agree with Zeuthen that Hippocrates may
well have
said, of segments of circles which are in the same
ratio as the circles, that they are
' the same part
' of the circles
respectively, for this is (in an incomplete form, it is true) the
language of the definition of proportion in the only theory of
proportion (the numerical) then known
(cf. Eucl. VII. Def. 20,
' Numbers are proportional when the first is the same multiple,
or the same
part, or the same parts, of the second that the
third
is
of the
fourth',
i.e. the two equal ratios are
of one
1
977/
of the following forms m, - ox â€” where
mi, n are integers)
;
the
illustrations, namely
the
semicircles
and
the
segments

HIPPOCRATES'S QUADRATURE OF LUNES
191
which are one third of the circles respectively, are from this
point of view quite harmless.
Only
the
transition
to
the view
of
similar segments
as
segments 'containing equal angles' remains to be explained.
And here we are in the dark, because we do not know how, for
instance, Hippocrates would have drawn a segment
in one
given
circle which should be
'the same part' of
that
circle
that a given segment of another given circle is of that circle.
,
(If e.g. he had used the proportionality of the parts into which
the bases
of the two
similar segments divide the diameters,
of
the
circles which
bisect them
perpendicularly, he
could,
by means of the sectors to which the segments belong, have
proved
that
the
segments, like the
sectors, are
in the
ratio
of the circles, just as Rudio supposes him to have done
; and
the equality of the angles in the segments would have followed
as in Rudio's proof.)
As it is, I cannot feel certain that the sentence 8io kuI ktX.
' this is the reason why similar segments contain equal angles
is not an addition by Simplicius.
Although Hippocrates was
fully aware
of
the
fact, he need not have stated
it in this
place, and Simplicius may have inserted the sentence in order
to bring Hippocrates's view of similar segments into relation
with
Euclid's
definition.
The sentence which follows about
' angles
of
'
semicircles and
' angles of
' segments, greater or
less than semicircles, is out of place, to say the least, and can
hardly come from Eudemus.
We resume Eudemus's account.
' After proving this, he proceeded to show in what way
it
was possible to square a lune the outer circumference of which
is
that
of a
semicircle.
This he
eflected by circumscribing
a
semicircle
about
an
isosceles
right-angled
triangle
and
(circumscribing)
about
the
base [= describing on the
base]
a segment
of a
circle
similar
to those
cut
off by the
sides.'
[This
is the problem of Eucl.
III.
33,
and involves the knowledge that similar
segments contain equal angles.]
'Then, since the segment about the
base is equal to the sum of those about
the sides, it follows that, when the part
of the
triangle above the segment about the base
is added
to both alike, the lune will be equal to the triangle.

192 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
' Therefore the lune, having been proved equal to the triangle,
can be squared.
' In
this
way,
assuming
that the outer circumference
of
the lune
is that
of a
semicircle, Hippocrates
easily squared
the lune.

[This proof is supposed to have been given by Eudemus in

fused.

to have
been
substantially
as

This is a problem of a type
which the Greeks
called
vevcrei^,
inclinationes
or
vergings.
Theoretically
it may be regarded as the problem of finding
a length
(x) such that, if F be so taken on CD that BF â€” x,
-Bi^ produced will intercept between CD and the circumference
of the semicircle a length EF equal to
\/|
. AK.
If we suppose it done, we have
EB.BF=AB.BC = AK-]
or
x{x-\- -/Â§
. a) = a^
(where AK = a).
That
is, the problem
is equivalent to the solution
of the
quadratic equation
X'' + -/f
. ax = a^.
This again
is the problem of
' applying to a straight Hne
of length -/f
. a a rectangle exceeding by a square figure and
equal in area to a^
', and would theoretically be solved by the
Pythagorean
method
based on the theorem
of
Eucl.
II.
6.
Undoubtedly Hippocrates could have solved the problem by
this theoretical method
; but he may, on this occasion, have
used the purely mechanical method
of marking on a ruler
or straight edge a length equal to
-v/f. AK, and then moving
it till the points marked lay on the circumference and on CD
respectively, while the
straight edge also passed through B.
This method
is
perhaps indicated by the
fact that he
first
places EF
(without
producing
it
to
B)
and
afterwards
joins BF.
We come now
to
the
last
of
Hippocrates's
quadratures.
Eudemus proceeds :]
'Thus
Hippocrates squared every ^
(sort
of)
lune,
seeing
that 1 (he squared) not only (1) the lune which has for its outer
' Tannery brackets
Tra^Ti. and
eiirep
Kai.
Heiberg thinks
(I.e. p. 343)
the wording
is that
of Simplioius reproducing the content of Eudemus.
The wording of the sentence is important with reference to the questions
(1) What was the paralogism with which
Aristotle
actually charged
Hippocrates ? and (2) What, if any, was the justification for the charge ?
Now the four quadratures as given by Eudemus are clever, and contain in
themselves no fallacy at all.
The supposed fallacy, then, can only have
consisted in an assumption on the part of Hippocrates that, because he

arc of a
semicircle, but
also
(2)
the lune
in which the outer circumference is greater, and (3) the lune in
which it is less, than a semicircle.
' But he also squared the sum of a lune and a circle in the
following manner.
' Let

that
the
square on the diameter of the outer

that of the inner.
'Let

and produced as far as the circumference of the outer

Let GH, HI, GI he joined:
[Then clearly GH, HI are sides of a hexagon inscribed in
the outer circle.]
'About GI

a

be

'Then
Gr=3GH\

[The
original
states
this
in words without the help of the
letters of the figure.]
'Also

had squared one particular lune of eacli of three types, namely those
which have for their outer circumferences respectively (1) a semicircle,
(2) an arc greater than a semicircle,
(3) an arc less than a semicircle, he
had squared all possible lunes, and therefore also the lune included in his
last
quadrature,
the squaring of which
(had
it been
possible) would
actually have enabled him
to square the
circle.
The question
is,
did
Hippocrates
so
delude
himself?
Heiberg
thinks
that,
in
the
then
state of logic, he may have done so.
But it seems impossible to believe
this of so good a mathematician
;
moreover,
if Hippocrates had really
thought that he had
squared the
circle,
it
is
inconceivable
that
he
would
not
have
said
so
in express terms
at the
end
of
his
fourth
quadrature.
Another recent view is that of Bjornbo (in Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Ency-
clopiidie, xvi, pp. 1787â€”99), who holds that Hippocrates realized periectly
the limits of what he had been able
to do and knew that ho had not
squared the circle, but that he deliberately used language'which, without
being actually untrue, was calculated to mislead any one who read him
into the belief that he had really solved the problem.
This, too, seems
incredible
;
for surely Hippocrates must have known that the first expert
who read his tract would detect the fallacy at once, and that he was
risking his reputation
as a mathematician for no purpose.
1 prefer to
think that he was merely trying to put what he had discovered in the
most favourable light
; but
it must be admitted that the effect of his
language was only to bring upon himself a charge which he might easily
have avoided.

198 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
' Therefore
segment on ff/[= 2(segmt. on Gi?) + 6 (segmt. on AB)\
= (segmts. on GH, HI) + {all segmts. in
inner circle).
[' Add
to each
side
the area bounded by GH, HI and the
arc
6r/;]
therefore (A GHI) = {lune GHI) + {all segmts. in inner circle).
Adding to both sides the hexagon in the inner circle, we have
(A GHI) + (inner hexagon) = (lune GHI) + (inner circle).
' Since,
then, the sum
of
the two
rectilineal figures can be
squared, so can the sum of the circle and the lune in question.'
Simplicius adds the following observations
:
' Now, so far as Hippocrates
is concerned, we must allow
that Eudemus was in a better position to know the facts, since
he was nearer the times, being a pupil of Aristotle.
But, as
regards the
" squaring
of the circle by means of segments
which Aristotle reflected on as containing a fallacy, there are
three possibilities, (1) that it indicates the squaring by means
of lunes (Alexander was quite right in expressing the doubt
implied
liy his words, "if
it
is the same
as the squaring by
means
of
lunes"),
(2) that
it
refers, not
to
the
proofs
of
Hippocrates, but some others, one of which Alexander actually
reproduced, or (3) that it is intended to reflect on the squaring
by Hippocrates of the circle plus the lune, which Hippocrates
did in fact prove
" by means of segments ", namely the three
(in the greater circle) and those in the
lesser
circle.
.
.
. On

HIPPOCRATES'S QUADRATQRE OF LUNES
199
this
third hypothesis the
fallacy would
lie
in the
fact that
the sum
of the
circle and the lune
is squared, and not the
circle
alone.'
If, however, the reference
of
Aristotle was really to Hip-
pocrates's
last quadrature
alone, Hippocrates was
obviously
misjudged
; there is no fallacy in
it, nor
is Hippocrates likely
to
have
deceived
himself
as
to
what
his
proof
actually
amounted to.
In the above reproduction
of the
extract from Eudemus
I have marked by italics the passages where the writer follows
the ancient fashion of describing points, lines, angles, &c., with
reference to the letters in the figure
: the ancient practice was
to write to (nj/ieTov e(p' & (or k<p' ov) K, the (point) on which (is)
the letter K, instead
of the shorter form to K

; and so on.
Some have
assumed
that, where the longer archaic form, instead of the
shorter Euclidean, is used, Eudemus must be quoting Hippocrates
verbatim
; but this is not a safe criterion, because, e.g., Aristotle
himself uses both forms of expression, and there
are, on the
other hand, some relics of the archaic form even in Archimedes.
Trigonometry
enables us readily
to
find
all the types
of
Hippocratean
lunes
that
can
be
squared
by
means
of
the

200 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
We also have
rsinO ^iAB = r' sin 6'
(1)
In order that the lune may be squareable, we must have, m
the first place,
r^O = r'^^'.
Suppose that
6 = m6', and it follows that
r' â€” Vini
. r.
Aceordmgly the area becomes
|r^(msin 2^' â€” sin 2mQ')
;
and
it remains only to solve the equation
(1) above, which
becomes
sinm^'= -Jm.smQ'.
This reduces to a quadratic equation only when m has one
of the values
2,
3,
|,
5,
|.
The solutions of Hippocrates correspond to the
first three
values of m.
But the lune is squareable by
' plane
' methods
in the other two cases also.
Clausen (1840) gave the last four
cases of the problem as new^
(it was not then known that
Hippocrates had solved more than the
first)
;
but, according
to
M.
Simon 2,
all
five
cases
were
given much
earlier
in
a
dissertation by Martin Johan Wallenius
of Abo
(Abveae,
1766).
As early as 1687 Tschirnhausen noted the existence
of an infinite number of squareable portions of
the
first
of
Hippoerates's lunes.
Vieta ^ discussed the case in which tn = 4,
which of course leads to a cubic equation.

Reduction of the proble'm of doubling
the cube
to
the finding of two mean proportionals.
We have already alluded to Hippoerates's discovery of the
reduction of the problem
of duplicating the cube
to that of
finding two mean proportionals in continued proportion.
That
is, he discovered that, if
a:x â€” x:y = y.h,
then
a^ -.x^ = a:b.
This
shows
that
he
could work with
compound ratios, although for him the theory of proportion
must
still
have
been
the
incomplete,
numerical,
theory
developed by the Pythagoreans.
It has been suggested that

ELEMENTS AS KNOWN TO HIPPOCRATES
201
the idea of the reduction of the problem of duplication may
have
occurred
to him
through
analogy.
The
problem
of
doubling a square
is included
in that
of finding one mean
proportional between
two
lines;
he
might
therefore have
thought
of what would
be the
effect
of
finding two mean
proportionals.
Alternativeljr he may have got the idea from
the theory of numbers.
Phito
in the Timaeus has the pro-
positions that between two square numbers there is one mean,
proportional number, but that two cube numbers are connected,
not by one, but by two mean numbers in continued proportion.^
These
are the theorems
of Eucl.
VIII.
11,
12, the latter of
which is thus enunciated
:
' Between two cube numbers' there
are two mean proportional numbers, and the cube has to the
cube the ratio triplicate of that which the side has to the side.'
If
this proposition was
really
Pythagorean,
as seems prob-
able enough, Hippocrates had only to give
the
geometrical
adaptation of
it.
(y)
The Elements as known
to HipiMcrates.
We can now
take
stock
of
the
advances made
in
the
Elements up to the time when Hippocrates compiled a work
under that title. We have seen that the Pythagorean geometry
already contained the substance
of
Euclid's Books I and
II,
part of Book IV, and theorems corresponding to a great part
of Book VI
; but there
is no evidence that the Pythagoreans
paid much attention to the geometry of the circle as we find
it, e.g., in
Eucl., Book HI.
But, by the time of Hippocrates,
the main propositions of Book III were also known and used,
as we
see
from
Eudemus's account of
the quadratures
of
lunes.
Thus
it
is assumed that
' similar
' segments contain
equal angles, and, as Hippocrates assumes that two segments
of circles are similar when the obvious thing about the figure
is that the angles at the circumferences which are the supple-
ments of the angles in the segments are one and the same,
we may clearly infer, as above stated, that Hippocrates knew
the theorems
of Eucl.
III.
20-2.
Further, he assumes the
construction on a given straight line of a segment similar to
another given segment
(cf. Eucl.
III.
33).
The theorems of
Eucl.
III.
26-9 would
obviously
be known to
Hippocrates
'
Plato, Timaeus, 32 a, b.

202 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
as
was
that
of

31
(that
the angle
in a
semicircle
is
a right
angle, and
that, according
as
a segment
is
less
or
greater than a semicircle, the angle in it
is obtuse or acute).
He assumes
the
solution
of the problem
of
circumscribing
a circle about a triangle (Eucl. IV.
5), and the theorem that
the
side
of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle
is equal
to the radius (Eucl. IV. 15).
But the most remarkable
fact of
all
is
that, according to
Eudemus, Hippocrates actually proved the theorem of Eucl..
XII.
2, that circles are to one another as the squares on their
dia-meters,
afterwards
using
this
proposition
to prove
that
similar segments are
to one another as
the squares on their
bases.
Euclid
of
course
proves
XII.
2 by
the
method
of
exhaustion, the invention of which
is attributed to Eudoxus
on
the
ground
of
notices
in
Archimedes.'
This
method
depends on the use of a certain lemma known as the Axiom
of Archimedes, or, alternatively, a lemma similar to
it.
The
lemma used by Euclid
is his proposition X.
1, which is closely
related to Archimedes's lemma in that the latter is practically
used
in the
proof
of
it.
Unfortunately we have no
infor-
mation as to the nature of Hippocrates's proof
;
if, however,
it amounted to a genuine proof, as Eudemus seems to imply,
it
is
difficult
to
see how
it could have been
effected
other-
wise than by some anticipation in essence of the method of
exhaustion.
Theodorus of Cyeene, who is mentioned by Proclus along
with Hippocrates as a celebrated geometer and is claimed by
lamlilichus
as
a
Pythagorean,^
is only known
to
us from
Plato's
Theaetetus.
He
is said to have been
Plato's teacher
in mathematics,^ and it
is likely enough that Plato, while on
his way to or from Egypt, spent some time with Theodorus at
Gyrene,* though, as we gather from the Theaetetus, Theodorus
had also been in Athens in the time of Socrates.
We learn
from the same dialogue that he was a pupil of Protagoras, and
was distinguished not only
in geometry but
in astronomy,
arithmetic, music, and all educational subjects.Â®

which we have of a particular achievement of his suggests that
it was he who
first carried the theory of irrationals beyond
the
first
step, namely
the
discovery by
the
Pythagoreans
of
the
irrationality
of
V2.
According
to
the
Theaetetus}
Theodorus
'was
proving 2
to
us
a
certain
thing
about
square
roots
(SwdfiiLs:), I mean (the square roots, i.e. sides) of three square
feet and of five square
feet, namely that these roots are not
commensurable in length with the foot-length, and he went on
in this way, taking all the separate
cases up to the root of
1 7 square feet, at which point, for some reason, he stopped
'.
That
is, he proved the
irrationality
of
-/s,
-/S
... up
to
\/l7.
It does not appear, however, that he had reached any
definition of a surd in general or proved any general proposi-
tion about all surds, for Theaetetus goes on to say
:
'The idea occurred to the two of us (Theaetetus and the
younger
Socrates),

The idea
is that Theodorus's exposition must have
included two things, first the construction of straight lines representing

in order to show that these straight lines exist, and secondly the proof
that each of them

is argued,
eypa<i)e must indicate the construction and anocpaivav the proof.
But in
the
first place
it
is impossible that lypacpe
n. mpi, 'he wrote something
about
' (roots), should mean
' constructed each of the roots '.
Moreover, if
aTTocpaivav is bracketed (as it is by Burnet), the supposed contrast between
i'ypa<j>e and
airocfimpa)}/
disappears, and
eypacpi must mean
' proved
',
in
accordance
with
the
natural meaning
of eypacpe
n, because there
is
nothing else to govern
Sti
p.rjKei, ktX. ('that they are not commensurable
in length
.
. .'), which phrase is of course a closer description of n.
There
are plenty of instances of ypdcfiav in the sense of
' prove '.
Aristotle says
(Topics, e.
3, 158 b 29) 'It would appear that in mathematics too some
things are diiBcult to prove
(oi pa&ias ypa(pfa-dai) owing to the want of
a definition, e. g. that a straight line parallel to the side and cutting a plane
figure (parallelogi'am) divides the straight line
(side) and the area simi-
larly
'.
Cf Archimedes, On the Sphere and Cylinder, ii, Pref.,
' It happens
that most of them are proved {ypd(peadai) by means of the theorems
.

'
;
' Such of the theorems and problems as are proved (ypdipeTai) by means of
these theorems

'
; Quadrature of a Parabola, Pref,
' I have proved (iypacfiov)

I do not deny that Theodorus constructed his
' roots '
;
I have no doubt
that he did
; but this is not what eypa(pe n. means.

204 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO
PLATO'S TIME
to be unlimited in multitude, to try to arrive at one collective
term by which we
could
designate
all
these
roots
.
We
divided number
in general
into two
classes.
The
number
which can be
expressed as equal
multiplied by equal
(i'a-ov
la-aKti} we likened
to a
square
in
form, and we
called
it
square
and
equilateral
{laoTrXevpov)
.
. The
intermediate
number, such as
three, five, and any number which cannot
be expressed as equal multiplied by equal, but
is either
less
times more or more times
less, so that it is always contained
by a greater and a less
side, we likened to an oblong figure
{jrpofirJKeL
(T\r]iJ.aTL) and called an oblong number.
.
. Such
straight lines then as square the equilateral and plane number
we defined as length
(fifjKos), and such as square the oblong
(we called) square roots (Swd/xeLs) as not being commensurable
with the others in length but only in the plane areas to which
their squares are equal.
And there
is another distinction of
the same sort with regard to solids.'
Plato gives no hint as to how Theodoras proved the proposi-
tions
attributed
to him, namely that
-/s,
-/s
...
^17
are
all incommensurable with
1
;
there
is therefore a wide
field
open for speculation, and
several conjectures have been put
forward.
(1)
Hultsch, in a paper on Archimedes's approximations to
square roots, suggested that Theodorus took the line of seeking
successive approximations.
Just as f
, the first approximation
to
-/2, was obtained by putting
2 = ff
, Theodorus might
have
started from
3 = ff
, and found J or
l-|i
as
a
first
approximation, and then, seeing that 1^^ > -/3>lf, might
(by successive trials, probably) have found that
1 _i

i_
i
^2

'S^
-^ ^"^^^2
8 16 32
128'
But the method of finding closer and closer approximations,
although
it might afibrd a presumption that the true value
cannot be exactly expressed in fractions, would leave Theodorus
as far as ever from proving that -/s is incommensurable.
(2) There is no mention of -v/2 in our passage, and Theodorus
probably omitted
this
case because
the incommensurability
of /2 and the traditional method of proving it were already
known.
The traditional proof was, as we have seen, a reduciio
ad absurdum showing that,
if
v/2
is commensurable with
1,
it
will follow that the same number
is both even and odd,
i.e. both divisible and not divisible by
2.
The same method

THEODORUS OF CYRENE
205
of proof can be adapted to the cases of V's, V5, &c., if
3, 6
...
are substituted for
2
in the proof;
e.g. we can prove
that,
if
a/ 3
is commensurable with
1, then the same number will
be
both
divisible and
not
divisible by
3.
One
suggestion,
therefore,
is that Theodoras may have applied this method
to
all
the
cases from
-/s
to
Vl?.
We can put the proof
quite generally thus.
Suppose that iV" is a non-square number
such as
3, 5
..., and,
if possible, let -/iV = m/n, where m, n
are integers prime to one another.
Therefore
7n^ = N .n^;
therefore wi^
jg divisible by N, so that m also
is a multiple
of K
Let
m = fi.jSf,
(1)
and consequently
n^ = N. fi^.
Then in the same way we can prove that n
is
a, multiple
of N.
Let
n â€” p .JSf
.
.
.
...
(2)
It follows from
(1) and (2) that 7n/n â€” [i/v, where
fi < m
and V < n; therefore m/n
is not in
its lowest terms, which
is contrary to the hypothesis.
The
objection
to
this
conjecture
as
to
the
nature
of
Theodorus's proof
is that
it
is so easy an adaptation of the
traditional
proof
regarding
V2
that
it wouH
hardly
be
important enough to mention
as a new discovery.
Also
it
would be
quite unnecessary
to
repeat
the
proof
for
every
case up to V 1 7
;
for
it would be clear, long before
â€¢/ 1 7 was
reached, that
it
is generally applicable.
The latter objection
seems to me to have force.
The former objection may or may
not
; for I do not feel sure that Plato is necessarily attributing
any important new discovery to Theodoras.
The
object
of
the
whole
context
is
to
show
that
a
definition by
mere
enumeration
is no definition;
e.g.
it
is no
definition of
kni-
a-Trjfir]
to
enumerate
particular
kma-Tfjixai
(as
shoemaking,
carpentering, and the like)
;
this is to put the cart before the
horse, the general definition of k-ma-Trinr] being logically prior.
Hence
it was
probably
Theaetetus's
generalization
of
the
procedure
of
Theodorus
which
impressed
Plato
as
lieing
original and important rather than Theodorus's proofs them-
selves.

206 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
(3) The
third hypothesis
is that of
Zeuthen.^
He
starts
with the assumptions
(a) that the method of proof used by
Theodorus must have been original enough to
call for special
notice from
Plato, and
(b)
that
it must have been of such
a kind that the application of
it to each surd required to be
set
out
separately
in consequence
of
the
variations
in
the
numbers
entering
into
the
proofs.
Neither
of
these
con-
ditions is satisfied by the hypothesis of a mere adaptation to
-/3,
-/ 5
...
of
the
traditional
proof
with regard
to
V2.
Zeuthen therefore suggests another hypothesis as
satisfying
both
conditions, namely
that Theodorus
used
the
criterion
furnished by
the
process
of
finding
the
greatest common
measure
as stated in the theorem
of Eucl. X.
2.
' If, when
the lesser of two unequal magnitudes is continually subtracted
in
turn
from
the
greater
[this
includes
the
subtraction
from any
term
of
the highest multiple
of
another
that
it
contains], that which
is
left never measures the one before
it, the magnitudes
will be incommensurable
'
; that
is,
if two
magnitudes are such that the process of finding their G. C. M.
never comes to an end, the two magnitudes are incommensur-
able.
True, the proposition Eucl. X.
2 depends on the famous
X.
1
(Given two unequal magnitudes,
if
from
the
greater
there be subtracted more than the half (or the half), from the
remainder more than the half (or the half), and so on, there
will be
left, ultimately, some magnitude less than the lesser
of the
original magnitudes), which
is based on
the famous
postulate of Eudoxus (= Eucl. V, Def. 4), and therefore belongs
to a later date.
Zeuthen gets over this objection by pointing
out that the necessity
of X.
1
for a rigorous demonstration
of X.
2 may not have been noticed at the time;
Theodorus
may
have
proceeded by
intuition,
or
he may
even
have
postulated
the truth proved
in X.
1.
TJie most obvious ease in which incommensurability can be
proved by using the process of finding the greatest common
measure is that of the two segments of a straight line divided
in extreme and mean ratio.
For, if AB is divided in this way
at C, we have only to mark off along CA (the greater segment)

a length CD equal to CB (the lesser segment), and GA
is then
divided
at D
in
extreme
and mean
ratio, CD
being

this

Similarly, DG
is
so divided
if we
set
off DE
along
it
equal
to DA
;
and
so
on.
This
is
precisely
the
process
of finding the greatest common measure of AG, GB,
the quotient being always unity
; and the process never comes
to an end.
Therefore AG, GB are incommensurable.
What
is proved in this case is the irrationality of K-ZS â€” l).
This
of
course
shows
incidentally
that
-/S
is
incommensurable
with
1.
It has been suggested, in view of the easiness of the
above proof, that the irrational may first have been discovered
with reference to the segments of a straight line cut in extreme
and mean
ratio, rather than with reference to the diagonal
of a square in relation to
its
side.
But
this seems, on the
whole, improbable.
Theodorus would, of course, give a geometrical form to the
process
of finding the G. C. M.,
after he had
represented in
a
figure
the
particular
surd
which
he
was
investigating.
Zeuthen illustrates by two cases,
\''S and \/ 3.
We will take the former, which is the easier.
The process
of finding the G. C. M.
(if any) oi V 5 and
1
is as follows
:
1) v'5(2
2
v^5-2)l
(4
4(v/5-2)
(v/5-2)2
[The explanation of the second division is this
:
1 =(v^5-2)(v'5 + 2) = 4(a/5-2) + {^5-2}'.]
Since, then, the ratio of the last term (\/5 â€” 2)^ to the pre-
ceding one,
-/5 â€” 2,
is the same as the
ratio of -/Sâ€” 2
to
1,
the process will never end.
Zeuthen has a geometrical proof which is not difiicult
; but
I think the following proof is neater and easier.
Let ABG be a triangle right-angled at B, such that AB =
1,
BG =
2, and therefore AG = Vs.

208 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
Cut
oflf CD from GA equal to GB, and draw DE at right
angles to GA.
Then BE = EB.
Now
AD â€” â€¢/ 5 â€” 2,
and by
similar triangles
DE= 2AD= 2(-v/5-2).
Cut
oft" from EA the portion EF equal to
ED, and draw FG at right angles to AE.
Then AF = AB-BF = AB-2DE
= l-4(v'5-2)
= (v/5-2f.
Therefore ABC, ADE, AFG are diminishing
similar triangles such that
AB:AD:AF=
1
: (^/5-2):(-/5-2)-,
and so on.
Also AB > FB,
i.e. 2DE or
4 AD.
Therefore the side of each triangle in the series is less than
i of the corresponding side of the preceding triangle.
In the
case of
-s/S
the process of finding the
G. C. M. of
-v/S and
1 gives

the ratio of ^(-/S

1 to (V'3-1).
This
case
is more
difficult
because we
i(V3-l)Â»
(-/3 â€” 1)^ being the same as that
to show
in
geometrical form
have
to
make
one
more
division before recurrence takes place.
The cases
-v/lO and V\7 are exactly
similar to that of V5.
The irrationality of ^2 can, of course,
be proved by the same method.
If ABGD
is a square, we mark ofi^ along the diagonal
AG & length AE equal to AB and draw
EF at
right angles to AG.
The same
thing is then done with the triangle CEF

THEODORUS OF GYRENE
209
as with the triangle ABC, and so on.
This could not have
escaped Theodoras
if
his
proof
in
the
eases
of
V'3,
V5...
took the form suggested by Zeuthen
; but he was presumably-
content to accept the traditional proof with regard to V2.
The
conjecture
of Zeuthen
is very
ingenious,
but,
as
he
admits, it necessarily remains a hypothesis.
Theaetetus^ (about 415-369 b. c.) made important contribu-
tions
to
the
body
of
the
Elements.
These
related
to two
subjects in particular, (a) the theory of irrationals, and (b) the
five regular solids.
That
Theaetetus
actually
succeeded
in
generalizing
the
theory of irrationals on the lines indicated in the second part
of
the passage from
Plato's dialogue
is
confirmed by other
evidence.
The commentary on
Eucl. X, which has survived
in Arabic and
is attributed* to Pappus, says
(in the passage
partly quoted above, p. 155) that the theory of irrationals
'had
its
origin
in
the
school
of Pythagoras.
It was con-
siderably developed by Theaetetus the Athenian, who gave
proof in
this
part
of mathematics,
as
in
others,
of
ability
which
has been justly
admired. ... As
for the
exact
dis-
tinctions
of
the above-named magnitudes and
the
rigorous
demonstrations of the propositions to which this theory gives
rise,
I
believe
that
they
were
chiefly
established hy
this
mathematician.
For
Theaetetus had
distinguished
square
roots ^ commensurable in length from those which are incom-
mensurable,
and
had
divided
the
well-known
species
of
irrational lines after the different means, assigning the inedial
to geometry, the binomial to arithmetic, and the apotome to
harmony, as is stated by Eudemus the Peripatetic' ^
^ On Theaetetus the reader may consult a recent dissertation, De Theae-
teto Atheniensi mathematico, by Eva Sachs (Berlin, 1914).
''
' Square roots
'.
The word in Woepcke's translation
is
' puissances ',
which indicates that the oi-iginal word was 8vmfi.as.
This word is always
ambiguous
;
it might mean
' squares ', but
I have translated
it
' square
roots
' because the Siw/iu of Theaetetus's definition
is undoubtedly the
square root of a non-square number, a surd.
The distinction in that case
would appear to be between
' square roots
' commensurable in length and
square
roots commensurable
in square
only
;
thus
^/S and
v'12
are
commensurable
in
length,
while
-v/3 and

are
commensurable
in
square
only.
I do not see how Swaneis could here mean squares
;
for
' squares commensurable in length
'
is not an intelligible phrase, and
it
does not seem legitimate to expand it into
' squares (on straight lines)
commensurable in length ',

210 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
The
irrationals
called
by
the
names
here
italicized
ar(
described in Eucl. X. 21, 36 and 73 respectively.
Again, a scholiast^ on
Eucl. X.
9
(containing the genera
theorem that squares which have not to one another the ratic
of
a square number
to a
square number have
their
sides
incommensurable in length) definitely attributes the discovery
of
this theorem to Theaetetus.
But, in accordance with the
traditional practice
in Greek geometry,
it was necessary
to
prove the existence of such incommensurable
ratios, and this
is done
in the
porism
to
Eucl. X.
6 by a geometrical
con-
struction
; the porism first states that, given a straight line a
and any two numbers m, n, we can find a straight line x such
that a:x = 7n:n] next it is shown that, if y be taken a mean
proportional between a and x, then
a^:y^ = a: x = 7n:n;
if,
therefore, the
ratio m
: n
is
not a
ratio
of a square
to
a
square, we
have
constructed
an
irrational
straight
line
a >/ {n/m) and
therefore
shown
that
such
a
straight
line
exists.
The proof of Eucl. X.
9 formally depends on VIII.
1 1 alone
(to the
effect that between two square numbers there is one
mean proportional number, and the square has to the square
the
duplicate ratio of that which the
side has to the
side)
â€¢
and VIII.
11 again depends on VII.
17 and 18
(to the
effect
that ah:ac = b: c, and a:b = ac:bc,
propositions which are
not identical).
But Zeuthen points out that these propositions
are an
inseparable
part
of
a
whole
theory
established
in
Book VII and the early part
of Book VIII, and
that
the
real demonstration of X. 9 is rather contained in propositions
of these Books which give a rigorous proof of the necessary
and
sufiicient
conditions
for the
rationality
of
the
square
roots
of numerical
fractions and
integral numbers, notably
VII.
27 and
the
propositions
leading
up
to
it,
as
well
as
VIII.
2^
He therefore suggests that the theory estabhshed
in
the
early
part
of Book VII was not due
to
the Pytha-
goreans, but was an innovation made by Theaetetus with the
direct object of laying down a
scientific basis for his theory
of irrationals, and that this, rather than the mere formulation
'
X, No. 62 (Heiberg's Euclid, vol. v, p. 450).

THEAETETUS
211
of the theorem of Eucl. X. 9, was the achievement which Plato
intended to hold up to admiration.
This
conjecture
is
of
great
interest, but
it
is,
so
far as
I know, without any
positive
confirmation.
On
the other
hand,
there
are
circumstances
which
suggest doubts.
For
example, Zeuthen himself admits that Hippocrates, who
re-
duced the duplication of the cube to the finding of two mean
proportionals, must have had a proposition corresponding to
the very proposition VIII. 11 on which X. 9 formally depends.
Secondly, in the extract from Simplicius about the squaring
of lunes by Hippocrates, we have seen that the proportionality
of similar segments of circles to the circles of which they form
part is explained by the statement that
' similar segments are
those which are the same part of the circles
'
; and if we may
take this to be a quotation by Eudemus from Hippocrates's
own argument, the inference is that Hippocrates had a defini-
tion
of numerical proportion which" was
at
all events near
to that of
Eucl.
VII,
Def.
20.
Thirdly,
there
is the proof
(presently to be given) by Archytas
of the proposition that
there can be no number which
is a (geometric) mean between
two
consecutive
integral
numbers,
in which
proof
it
will
be
seen
that
several
propositions
of
Eucl., Book
VII,
are
pre-supposed
;
but
Archytas
lived
(say) 430-365
B.C., and
Theaetetus was some
years
younger.
I am
not,
therefore,
prepared
to
give
up
the
view, which
has
hitherto
found
general
acceptance,
that
the
Pythagoreans
already
had
a
theory of proportion of a numerical kind on the
lines, though
not
necessarily
or
even
probably
with
anything
like
the
fullness and
elaboration,
of
Eucl., Book
VII.
While Pappus, in the commentary quoted, says that Theae-
tetus distinguished the well-known species of irrationals, and
in particular the medial, the binomial, and the apotome, he
proceeds thus
:
' As for Euclid, he
set himself to give rigorous rules, which
he
established,
relative
to commensurability and incommen-
surability
"in general;
he made
precise
the
definitions and
distinctions between
rational and
irrational
magnitudes, he
set out a great number of orders
of
irrational magnitudes,
and finally he made clear their whole extent.'
As Euclid proves that tliere are thirteen irrational straight
p2

212 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
lines in
all, we may perhaps assume that the subdivision of
the three
species of irrationals
distinguished by Theaetetus
into thirteen was due to Euclid himself, while the last words
of the quotation seem
to refer to
Eucl. X.
115, where
it
is
proved that from the inedial straight line an unlimited number
of other irrationals can be dei'ived which are all different from
it and from one another.
It will be remembered that, at the end of the passage of the
Theaetetus containing the definition of
' square roots
' or surds,
Theaetetus says that
' there
is a similar distinction in the case
of
solids
'.
We know
nothing
of any further development
of a theory of irrationals arising from
solids
; but Theaetetus
doubtless had in mind a distinction related to VIII. 12
(the
theorem that between two cube numbers there are two mean
proportional numbers)
in the same way
as the
definition
of
a
' square root
' or surd
is related to VIII.
1 1
; that is to say,
he referred to the incommensurable cube root of a non-cube
number which is the product of three factors.
Besides laying the foundation of the theory of irrationals
as we find it in Eucl., Book X, Theaetetus contributed no less
substantially
to
another
portion
of
the
Elements,
namely
Book
XIII,
which
is
devoted
(after
twelve
introductory
propositions)
to constructing the
five regular
solids, circum-
scribing spheres about them, and finding the relation between
the dimensions of the respective solids and the circumscribing
spheres.
We have already mentioned (pp. 159, 162) the tradi-
tions that Theaetetus was the first to
' construct' or 'write upon'
the
five l-egular
solids,^ and
that
his name was
specially
associated with the octahedron and the icosahedron.^
There
can
be
little doubt
that
Theaetetus's
' construction
'
of,
or
treatise
upon,
the
regular
solids
gave
the
theoretical
con-
structions much as we find them in Euclid.
Of
the
mathematicians
of
Plato's
time, two
others
are
mentioned with Theaetetus as having increased the number
of theorems in geometry and made a further advance towards
a
scientific
grouping
of
them, Leodamas
of
Thasos
and
Archytas
of
Taras.

to Leodamas, and
by which
the
latter too
is
said
to
have
discovered many
things in geometry '.^
Nothing more than this
is known of
Leodamas, but the passages are noteworthy as having given
rise
to the
idea that Plato invented the method
of mathe-
matical analysis, an idea which, as we shall see later on, seems
nevertheless to be based on a misapprehension.
Archytas of Taeas, a Pythagorean, the friend of Plato,
flourished in the first half of the fourth century, say 400 to
365 B.C.
Plato made his acquaintance when staying in Magna
Graecia, and he
is
said, by means of a letter, to have saved
Plato from death at the hands of Dionysius.
Statesman and
philosopher, he was famed for every sort of accomplishment.
He was general of the forces of his city-state for seven years,
though ordinarily the law forbade any one to hold the post
for more
than a year
;
and he was never
beaten.
He
is
said to have been the
first to write a systematic
treatise on
mechanics based on mathematical principles.'*
Vitruvius men-
tions
that,
like
Archimedes,
Ctesibius,
Nymphodorus, and
Philo
of
Byzantium,
Archytas
wrote
on
machines *
;
two
mechanical
devices
in
particular are attributed
to him, one
a
mechanical
dove made
of
wood
which
would
fly,Â°
the
other a irattle which, according to Aristotle, was found useful
to
' give
to
children
to occupy them, and
so prevent them
from breaking things about
the house
(for
the young
are
incapable of keeping still) '.^
We have already
seen Archytas
distinguishing
the
four
mathematical
sciences,
geometry,
arithmetic,
sphaeric
(or
astronomy), and music, comparing the art of calculation with
geometry in respect of its relative eflBciency and conclusive-
ness, and defining the three means in music, the arithmetic,

214 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
the
geometric,
and
the
harmonic
(a name
substituted
by
Archj^tas and Hippasus for the older name 'sub-contrary').
From his mention of sphaerlc in connexion with his state-
ment that
' the mathematicians have given us clear knowledge
about the speed of the heavenly bodies and their risings and
settings' we gather that in Archytas's time astronomy was
already treated mathematically, the properties of the sphere
being studied
so far as necessary
to explain the movements
in the celestial sphere.
He discussed too the question whether
the
universe
is
unlimited
in
extent,
using
the
following-
argument.
' If I were
at the
outside, say
at the heaven of the fixed
stars, could I stretch my hand or ray stick outwards or not 1
To suppose that I could not
is absurd
; and
if I can stretch
it out, that which
is outside must be either body or space
(it
makes no
difference which
it
is, as we shall
see).
We may
then in the same way get to the outside
of that
again, and
so on, asking on arrival at each new limit the same question
;
and if there is always a new place to which the stick may be
held
out,
this
clearly
involves
extension without
limit.
If
now what so extends
is body, the proposition is proved
; but
even
if
it
is
space,
then, since space
is that in which body
is or can be, and in the case of eternal things we must treat
that which potentially is as being, it follows equally that there
must be body and space (extending) without limit.'
^
In geometry, while Archytas doubtless increased the number
of theorems
(as Proclus
says), only one fragment of his has
survived, namely the solution of the problem of finding two
mean proportionals (equivalent to the duplication of the cube)
by a remarkable theoretical construction in three dimensions.
As
this, however, belongs to higher geometry and not to the
Elements, the description of
it will come more appropriately
in another place (pp. 246-9).
In music
he
gave
the numerical
ratios
representing
the
intervals of the tetrachord on three
scales, the anharmonic,
the chromatic, and the
diatonic.^
He held that sound is due
to impact, and that higher tones cori-espond to quicker motion
communicated to the air, and lower tones to slower motion.^

ARCHYTAS
215
Of the fragments of Archytas handed down to us the most
interesting from the point
of view of this chapter
is a proof
of
the
proposition
that
there can be no number which
is
a (geometric) mean between two numbers in the ratio known
as
eTTifiopios
or
superparticularis,
that
is,
(n+\):n.
This
proof is preserved by Boetius ^, and the noteworthy fact about
it
is that
it
is substantially
identical with the proof of the
same
theorem
in
Prop.
3
of
Euclid's
tract
on
the
Sectio
canonis.'^
I
will
quote Archytas's proof in
full, in order to
show
the
slight
difl'erences
from
the
Euclidean
form
and
notation.
Let A, B be the given
' superparticularis proportio
'
(ini-
jxopiov
SidcTTrjfia in
Euclid).
[Archytas
writes
the
smaller
number first (instead of second, as Euclid does)
; we are then
to
suppose that A, B are integral numbers
in the ratio of
n to {n+ 1).
I
Take
C, DE the smallest numbers which are in the ratio
of A
to
B.
[Here DE means B + E;
in
this
respect
the
notation
differs from
that
of
Euclid,
who,
as
usual,
takes
a
straight
line BF divided
into two parts
at
G, the
parts
BG, GF
corresponding
to
the B
and E
respectively
in
Archytas's
proof.
The
step
of finding
G, DE the
smallest
numbers
in the same
ratio
as that
of
Jl
to
i? presupposes
Eucl. VII. 33 applied to two numbers.]
Then BE exceeds C by an aliquot part of itself and of C
[cf. the definition of emfiSpios dpi6fi6s in Nicomachus,
i. 19. l].
Let B be the excess
[i.e. we suppose E equal to C].
I say that B is not a number, but a unit.
For, if D is a number and an ahquot part of BE, it measures
BE ; therefore it measures E, that is, G.
Thus B measures both C and BE:
which
is
impossible,
since the
smallest numbers which
are
in the same ratio
as
any numbers
are prime
to one another.
[This presupposes
Eucl. VII. 22.J
Therefore D is a unit
; that
is, BE exceeds C by a unit.
Hence no number can be found which
is a mean between
the two numbers C, BE [for there is no integer intervening].

iii. 11, pp. 285-6 Fiiedlein.
2 Musici sa-iptores Qraeci, ed. Jan, p. 14; Heiberg and Menge's Euclid,
vol. viii, p. 162.

216 THE ELEMENTS DOWN TO PLATO'S TIME
Therefore neither can any number be a mean between the
original numbers A, B, which are in the same ratio as G, BE
[cf. the more general proposition, Eucl. VIII. 8
; the particular
inference
is a consequence of Eucl. VII. 20, to the effect that
the
least numbers of those which have the same ratio with
them measure the latter the same number of times, the greater
the greater and the less the less].
Since this proof
cites as known several propositions corre-
sponding to propositions in Euclid, Book VII, it affords a strong
presumption that there already
existed, at
least
as early as
the time of Archytas, a treatise of some sort on the Elements
of Arithmetic
in a form
similar
to the Euclidean, and con-
taining many
of
the
propositions afterwards
embodied
by
Euclid
in his arithmetical books.
Summary.
We are now in a position to form an idea of the scope of
the Elements at the stage which thej^ had reached in Plato's
time.
The substance of Eucl. I-IV was practically complete.
Book V was of course missing, because the theory of proportion
elaborated
iia that book was the creation of Eudoxus.
The
Pythagoreans had a theory of proportion applicable to com-
mensurable magnitudes only
;
this was probably a numerical
theory on lines similar to those of Eucl., Book VII.
But the
theorems
of
Eucl., Book VI, in general,
albeit
insufficiently
established in so far as they depended on the numerical theory
of proportion, were known and used by
the Pythagoreans.
We have seen reason to suppose that there existed Elements
of
Arithmetic
partly
(at
all
events) on
the
lines
of
Eucl.,
Book VII, while some propositions of Book VIII (e.g. Props.
11 and
12) were also common property.
The Pythagoreans,
too, conceived the idea of perfect numbers (numbers equal to
the sum of all their divisors)
if they had not actually shown
(as Euclid does in IX. 36) how they are evolved.
There can
also be little doubt that many of the properties of plane and
solid numbers and of similar numbers of both classes proved in
Euclid, Books VIII and IX, were known before Plato's time.
We come next to Book X, and it is plain that the foundation
of the whole had been well and truly laid by Theaetetus, and

SUMMARY
217
the main
varieties
of irrationals distinguished, though their
classification was not carried so far as in Euclid.
The substance of Book XI. 1-19 must already have been in-
cluded in the Elements (e.g. Eucl. XI. 1 9 is assumed in Archytas's
construction for the two mean proportionals), and the whole
theory of the section of Book XI in question would be required
for Theaetetus's work on the five regular solids: XI. 21 must
have been known to the Pythagoreans
: while there is nothing
in the latter portion of the book about parallelepipedal solids
which (subject to the want of a rigorous theory of proportion)
was not within the powers of those who were familiar with
the theory of plane and solid numbers.
Book XII employs throughout the method
of exhaustion,
the orthodox form
of which
is attributed to Eudoxus, who
grounded
it upon a lemma known as Archimedes's Axiom or
its equivalent (Eucl. X.
1 ).
Yet even XII.
2, to the effect that
circles are to one another as the square of their diameters, had
already
been
anticipated
by
Hippocrates
of
Chios,
while
Democritus
had
discovered
the
truth
of
the
theorems
of
XII.
7,
For., about
the volume
of a pyramid, and XII.
10,
about the volume of a cone.
As in the case of Book X, it would appear that Euclid was
indebted to Theaetetus for much of the substance of Book XIII,
the
latter part
of which
(Props.
12-18)
is
devoted
to
the
construction of the five regular
solids, and the inscribing of
them in spheres.
There
is therefore probably
little in the whole compass of
the Eletnents of Euclid, except the new theory of proportion due
to Eudoxus and its consequences, which was not in substance
included in the recognized content of geometry and arithmetic
by
Plato's time, although the form and arrangement of the
subject-matter and the methods employed in particular cases
were different from what we find in Euclid.

VII
SPECIAL PROBLEMS
Simultaneously with the gradual evolution of the Elements,
the
Greeks
were
occupying
themselves
with
problems
in
higher geometry;
three problems in particular, the squaring
of the
circle, the doubhng of the cube, and the trisection of
any
given
angle,
were
rallying-points
for
mathematicians
during three centuries at least, and the whole course of Greek
geometry was profoundly influenced by the character of the
specialized investigations which had their origin in the attempts
to
solve these problems.
In
illustration we need only refer
to the
subject
of
conic
sections which began with the
use
made of two of the curves for the finding of two mean pro-
portionals.
The Greeks classified problems according to the means by
which they were solved.
The ancients, says Pappus, divided
them into three
classes, which they
called 'plane,
solid, and
linear
respectively.
Problems were plane
if they
could be
solved by means
of the
straight
line and
circle
only,
solid
if they could be solved by means of one or more conic sections,
and lineaj-
if their solution required the use of other curves
still more complicated and difficult to construct, such as spirals,
quadratrices,
cochloids (conchoids) and
cissoids, or again the
various curves included in the class of
' loci on surfaces
' [tottol
vpos
iTTLCpaveiaLs),
as they were called.^
Thei'e was a corre-
sponding
distinction
between
loci
:
plane
loci
are
straight
lines
or
circles;
solid
loci
are, according to the most
strict
classification,
conies
only, which
arise from
the
sections
of
certain
solids, namely cones
;
while
linear
loci
include
all
' Pappus,
iii, pp. 54-6, iv, pp. 270-2.

CLASSIFICATION OF PROBLEMS
219
higher
curves.^
Another
classification
of
loci
divides them
into loci on lines
{tottol npbs ypafinah) and loci on surfaces
(totj-oi
Trpos
enKpaveiais).^
The
former
term
is
found
in
Proclus, and" seems to be used in the sense both of loci which
are
lines (including of course
curves) and of
loci which are
spaces bounded by
lines;
e.g. Proclus speaks of 'the whole
space between the parallels' in Eucl.
I. 35 as being the locus
of the
(equal) parallelograms 'on the same base and in the
same
parallels'.^
Similarly
loci on surfaces in Proclus may
be
loci which
are
surfaces; but Pappus, who gives lemmas
to the two books of Euclid under that
title, seems to imply
that they were curves drawn on surfaces, e.g. the cylindrical
helix.*
It
is evident that
the Greek geometers came very
early
to the conclusion that the three problems in question were not
plane,
but
required
for
their
solution
either higher
curves
than
circles
or
constructions more
mechanical
in
character
than the mere use of the ruler and compasses in the sense of
Euclid's Postulates
1-3.
It was probably about 420 B.C. that
Hippias of Elis invented the curve known as the quadratrix
for the purpose of trisecting any angle, and
it was in the first
half of the fourth century that Archytas used for the dupli-
cation of the cube a solid construction involving the revolution
of plane figures in space, one of which made a tore or anchor-
ring with internal diameter nil.
There are very few records
of illusoiy attempts to do the impossible in these cases.
It
is
practically only in the case of the squaring of the circle that
we read of abortive efforts made by
' plane
' methods, and none
of
these
(with
the
possible
exception
of
Bryson's,
if
the
accounts
of
his
argument
are
correct)
involved
any
real
fallacy.
On
the
other
band,
the
bold
pi'onouncement
of
Antiphon the Sophist that by inscribing in a
circle a series
of regular polygons each
of which has twice as many sides
as the preceding one, we shall use up or exhaust the area of
the
circle, though â€¢ it was
in advance
of
his time and was
condemned as a fallacy on the technical ground that a straight
line
cannot
coincide with an
arc of a
circle however
short
its
length,

SPECIAL PROBLEMS
hands of
later and
abler geometers,
since
it gives
si method
of approximating, with any desired degree of accuracy, to the
area of a circle, and lies at the root of the method of exhaustion
as established by Eudoxus.
As regards Hippocrates's quadra-
ture
of
lunes, we
must,
notwithstanding
the
criticism
of
Aristotle charging him with a paralogism, decline to believe
that he was under any illusion
as
to the limits of what his
method
could accomplish,
or thought
that he had
actually
squared the circle.
The squaring of the
circle.
There
is presumably no problem which has exercised such
a
fascination throughout
the ages
as
that
of
rectifjdng or
squaring the circle
; and
it
is a curious fact that its attraction
has been no
less (perhaps even greater)
for the non-mathe-
matician than
for the mathematician.
It was naturally the
kind of problem which the Greeks, of
all people, would take
up with zest the moment that its difficulty was realized.
The
first name connected with the problem
is Anaxagoras, who
is said
to have
occupied
himself with
it when
in
prison.^
The Pythagoreans claimed that
it was solved in their school,
' as is clear from the demonstrations of Sextus the Pythagorean,
who got his method of demonstration from early tradition
' ^
;
but Sextus, or rather Sextius, lived in the reign of Augustus
or
Tiberius,
and,
for
the
usual
reasons,
no
value
can
be
attached
to the statement.
The
first serious attempts to solve the problem belong
to
the
second
half
of
the
fifth
century
B.C.
A
passage
of
Aristophanes's Birds
is quoted as evidence of the popularity
of the problem at the time (414 B.C.) of its first representation.
Aristophanes introduces Meton, the astronomer and discoverer
of the Metonic cycle of
1 9 years, who brings with him a ruler
and compasses, and makes a certain construction
' in order that
your circle may become square '.^
This is a play upon words,
because what Meton really does is to divide a circle into four
quadrants by two diameters
at right angles to one another
;
the idea
is of streets radiating from the agora in the centre

THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE
221
of a town
; the word reTpdymvos then really means
' with four
(right) angles
'
(at the centre), and not
' square
', but the word
conveys a laughing allusion
to the problem of squaring all
the same.
We have already given an account of Hippocrates's quadra-
tures of lunes.
These formed a sort of prolusio, and clearly
did not purport to be a solution of the problem
; Hippocrates
was aware that
' plane
' methods woiild not solve
it, but, as
a matter of interest, he wished
to show that, if circles could
not
be
squared by these
methods, they could be employed
to find the area of some figures bounded by arcs of
circles,
namely certain lunes, and even of the sum of a certain circle
and a certain lune.
Antiphon of Athens, the Sophist and a contemporary of
Socrates,
is
the
next
person
to
claim
attention.
We owe
to Aristotle and
his commentators
our knowledge
of
Anti-
phon's method.
Aristotle observes that
a geometer
is only
concerned
to refute any
fallacious
arguments
that may be
propounded in his subject if they are based upon the admitted
principles
of geometry
;
if they are
not
so based, he
is not
concerned to refute them
:
' thus it is the geometer's business to refute the quadrature by
means of segments, but
it
is not
his business
to refute that
of Antiphon '}
As we have seen, the quadrature
' by means of segments
' is
probably
Hippocrates's
quad-
rature
of
lunes.
Antiphon'
s
method
is indicated by Themis-
tius^ and
Simplieius.^
Suppose
there
is
any
regular
polygon
inscribed in a circle, e.g. a square
or an equilateral triangle.
(Ac-
cording to Themistius, Antiphon
beganwithan equilateral triangle,
and this seems to be the authentic
version;
Simplicius says he
in-
scribed some one of the regular polygons which can be inscribed

222
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE
in a circle,
' suppose, if it so happen, that the inscribed polygon
is a square '.)
On each side of the inscribed triangle or square
as base describe an
isosceles triangle with
its vertex on the
arc of the smaller segment of the circle subtended by the side.
This gives a regular inscribed polygon with double the number
of sides.
Repeat the construction with the new polygon, and
we have an inscribed polygon with four times as many sides as
the original polygon had.
Continuing the process,
'Antiphon thought that
in
this way the area
(of the
circle)
would be used up, and we should some time have a polygon
inscribed in the circle the sides of which would, owing to their
smallness, coincide with the circumference of the circle.
And,
as we can make a square equal to any polygon
.
.
. we
shall
be in a position to make a square equal to a circle.'
Simplicius
tells us that, while according to Alexander the
geometrical principle hereby infringed is the truth that a circle
.
touches a
straight
line
in one point
(only), Eudemus more
correctly said it was the principle that magnitudes are divisible
without limit
;
for, if the area of the circle is divisible without
limit, the process described by Antiphon will never result in
using up the whole area, or in making the sides of the polygon
take
the
position
of
the
actual circumference of the
circle.
But the objection to Antiphon's statement is really no more than
verbal
;
Euclid uses exactly the same construction in XII.
2,
only he expresses the conclusion
in a
different way, saying
that,
if the process be continued far enough, the small
seg-
ments
left over will be together less than any assigned area.
Antiphon in effect said the same thing, which again we express
by saying that the
circle
is
the limit of such an inscribed
polygon when the number of its sides is indefinitely increased.
Antiphon therefore deserves an honourable place in the historj'-
of geometry as having originated the idea of exhausting an
area by means
of
inscribed regular polygons with an
ever
increasing number of
sides, an idea upon which, as we
said,
Eudoxus founded
his
epoch-making
method
of exhaustion.
The practical value of Antiphon's construction
is
illustrated
by
Archimedes's
treatise
on
the
Measurement
of a
Circle,
where, by constructing inscribed and
circumscribed
regular
polygons with 96 sides, Archimedes proves that 3i > tt > S^f
,
the lower limit,
tt > .3if
, being obtained 'by
calculating
the

of

polygon

sides, which
is
constructed in Antiphon's manner from an inscribed equilateral

Bryson, who came a generation later than Antiphon, being
a pupil of Socrates or of Euclid
of Megara, was the author
of
another
attempted
quadrature
which
is
criticized
by
Aristotle
as
' sophistic
' and
' eristic
' on
the ground that
it
was based on principles not special to geometry but applicable
equally to other
subjects.^
The commentators give accounts
of Bryson's argument which are substantially the same, except
that Alexander speaks of squares inscribed and circumscribed
to a
circle^, while Themistius and
Philoponus speak
of any
polygons.^
According to Alexander, Bryson inscribed a square
in a circle and circumscribed another about
it, while he
also
took a square intermediate between them (Alexander does not
' say how constructed)
; then he argued that, as the intermediate
square is less than the outer and greater than the inner, while
the circle is also less than the outer square and greater than
the inner, and as things which are greater and less than the
same things respectively are equal, it follows that the circle is
equal
to
the
intermediate
square
:
upon which Alexander
remarks
that
not only
is
the
thing assumed
applicable
to
other things besides geometrical magnitudes, e.g. to numbers,
times, depths
of
colour, degrees
of heat or
cold,
&c., but
it
is also false because
(for instance) 8 and 9 are both less than
1
and greater than 7 and yet they are not equal.
As regards
the intermediate square (or polygon), some have assumed that
it was the arithmetic mean betweeja the inscribed and circum-
scribed figures, and others that
it was the geometric mean.
Both assumptions seem to be due to misunderstanding *

(1)
that Bryson
declared the
circle to be greater than
all inscribed, and less
than all circumscribed, polygons, while he
also says
(2)
that
the assumed axiom
is
trthe, though not peculiar to geometry.
This suggests a possible explanation of what otherwise seems
to be an absurd argument.
Bryson may have multiplied the
number of the sides of both the inscribed and circumscribed
regular polygons as Antiphon did with inscribed polygons;
he may then have argued
that,
if we continue
this process
long enough, we shall have an inscribed and a circumscribed
polygon
differing
so
little
in area
that,
if we can
describe
a polygon intermediate between them in area, the circle, which
is also intermediate in area between the inscribed and circum-
scribed polygons, must be equal to the intermediate polygon.^
If this
is the right explanation, Bryson's name by no means
deserves to be banished from histories of Greek mathematics
;
on
the contrary,
in
so far as he suggested the necessity
of
considering circumscribed
as well
as inscribed
polygons, he
went a
step further than Antiphon; and the importance of
the idea
is attested by the fact that, in the regular method
of exhaustion as practised by Archimedes, use is made of both
inscribed and circumscribed figures, and this compression, as it
were, of a circumscribed and an
inscribed figure into one so
that they ultimately coincide with one another, and with the
proper method of finding the area of a circle, hut that which has found
the most favour is to take the geometric mean between the inscribed and
circumscribed squares'.
I am not aware that he quotes Bryson
as the
authority for this method, and it gives the inaccurate value
tt = ^8 or
2-8284272
Isaac Argyrus (14th cent.) adds to his account of Bryson
the following sentence
:
' For the circumscribed square seems to exceed
the circle by the same amount as the inscribed square is exceeded by the
circle.'
'
It
is true that, accoi'ding to Philoponus, Proclus had before him an
explanation
of this kind, but rejected
it on the ground that
it would
mean that the circle must actually he the intermediate polygon and not
only be equal to
it, in which case 'Bryson's contention would be tanta-
mount to
Antiphon's, whereas according
to
Aristotle
it was based on
a quite
different principle.
But
it
is
sufficient that the
circle should
be taken
to be equal to any polygon that can be drawn intermediate
between the two ultimate polygons, and this gets over Proclus's difficulty.

THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE
325
curvilinear figure to be measured, is particularly characteristic
of Archimedes.
We come now to the real
rectifications or quadratures of
circles
effected by means
of higher curves, the construction
of which is more
' mechanical
' than that of the circle.
Some
of these curves were applied to solve more than one of the
three classical problems, and it is not always easy to determine
for
which
purpose they were
originally destined by
their
inventors,
because
the
accounts
of the
different authorities
do not quite agree.
lamblichus, speaking of the quadrature
of the circle, said that
' Archimedes effected
it by means
of the spiral-shaped curve,
Nicomedes by means of the curve known by the special name
quadratrix {TiTpaycovt^ovcra), ApoUonius by means of a certain
curve which
he
himself
calls
" sister
of
the cochloid " but
which
is the same as Nicomedes's curve, and finally Carpus
by means of a certain curve which he simply calls (the curve
arising) "from a double motion".'^
Pappus says that
' for
the squaring of the
circle
Dinostratus, Nicomedes and
certain other and later geometers used a certain curve which
took its name from its property
;
for those geometers called it
quadratrix.' ^
Lastly,
Proclus, speaking of
the
trisection
of any
angle,
says that
' Nicomedes
trisected any
rectilineal angle by means of the
conchoidal curves, the
construction, order and properties of
which he handed down, being himself the discoverer of their
peculiar
character.
Others
have
done
the
same
thing by
means
of
the
quadratrices
of
Hippias and
Nicomedes.
.
.
.
Others again, starting from the spirals of Archimedes, divided
any given rectilineal angle in any given ratio.'
All
these
passages
refer
to
the
qiiaxlratrix
invented by
Hippias of Elis.
The first two seem to imply that it was not
used by Hippias himself for squaring the
circle, but that
it
was Dinostratus
(a brother of Menaechmus) and other later
geometers who
first applied
it to that purpose;
lamblichus
and Pappus do not even mention the name of Hippias.
We
might conclude that Hippias originally intended his curve to

226
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE
be used for trisecting an angle.
But this becomes more doubt-
ful when the passages of Proclus are considered.
Pappus's
authority seems
to be Sporus, who was only slightly
older
than Pappus himself (towards the end of the third century a.d.),
and who was the author of a compilation called K-qpia con-
taining, among other
things, mathematical extracts
on
the
quadrature
of
the
circle and
the
duplication
of
the
cube.
Proclus's authority, on the other hand,
is doubtless Geminus,
who was much
earlier
(first century
B.C.)
Now
not only
does the above passage of Proclus make
it possible that the
name quadrairix may have been used by Hippias
himself,
but in another place Proclus
(i.e. Geminus) says that different
mathematicians have explained
the properties
of particular
kinds of curves
:
' thus Apollonius shows in the case of each of the conic curves
what
is
its
property,
and
similarly
Nicomedes
with
the
conchoids, Hippicis ivith the
quadratrices, and Perseus with
the spirie curves.' ^
This suggests that Geminus had before him a regular treatise
by Hippias on the properties of the quadratrix (which may
have disappeared by the time of Sporus), and that Nicomedes
did not
write any such general work on
that curve
;
and,
if
this
is
so,
it seems
not
impossible
that
Hippias himself
discovered
that
it would
serve
to
rectify, and
therefore
to
square, the
circle.

THE QUADRATRIX OF HIPPIAS
337
Then, in
their ultimate positions, the moving straight Une
and the moving radius will both coincide with A D
; and
at
any previous instant during the motion the moving line and
the moving radius will by their intersection determine a point,
as F or L.
The locus of these points is the quadratrix.
The property of the curve is that
IBAD:IEAD = (arc BED)
: (arc ED) = AB
: FH.
In other words, if
is the angle FAD made by any radius
vector AF with AD, p the length of AF, and a the length
of the side of the square,
p sin (p
<p
a
-Itt
Now clearly, when the curve is once constructed, it enables
us not only to
trisect the angle EAD but also to divide it in
any given ratio.
For let FH be divided at F' in the given ratio.
Draw F'L
parallel to AD to meet the curve in L
: join AL, and produce
it to meet the circle in
iV^.
Then the angles EAN, NAD are in the ratio of FF' to F'H,
as is easily proved.
Thus the quadi-atrix lends itself quite readily to the division
of any angle in a given ratio.
The application of the quadratrix to the rectification of the
circle
is
a more
difficult
matter,
because
it
requires us
to
know
the
position
of
G,
the
point
where
the
quadratrix
intersects AD.
This difficulty was fully appreciated in ancient
times, as we shall see.
Meantime,
assuming
that
the
quadratrix
intersects AD
in G, we have to prove the proposition which gives the length
of the arc of the quadrant BED and therefore of the circum-
ference of the circle.
This proposition is to the effect that
(arc of quadrant BED)
: AB =^ AB: AG.
This is proved by reductio ad absurdum.
If the
former
ratio
is not equal
to AB:AG,
it must be
equal to AB.AK, where AK
is either
(1) greater or (2)
less
than A G.
(1) Let AK he
greater than AG;
and with A
as centre

228
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE
and AK as radius, draw the quadrant KFL cutting the quad-
ratrix in F and AB in L.
Join AF, and produce
it
to meet the circumference BED
in E; draw i^if perpendicular to AD.
Now, by hypothesis,
(arc BED) :AB = AB: AK
= (arc BED)
: (arc LFK)
;
therefore
4B = (arc LFK).
But, by the property of the quadra-
trix,
AB:FH= (arc BED)
: (arc ED)
= (&vcLFK):{eiVcFK);
and it was proved that AB =
(s^rc LFK)
;
therefore
FH = (arc FK)
:
which is absurd.
Therefore AK is not greater than AG.
(2) Let AKhe less than AG.
With centre A and radius AK draw the quadrant KML.
Draw KF at right angles to ^i* meeting the quadratrix
in* F\
join AF, and
let
it meet
the
quadrants in M, E respectively.
Then, as before, we prove that
AB=^ i&vcLMK).
And, by the property of the quad-
ratrix,
Therefore, since
AB
: FK = (arc BED)
: (arc DE)
= (arc LMK)
: (arc MK).
AB = (arc LAIK),
FK = (arc KiM)
:
Therefore AK is not less than AG.
which is absurd.
Since then AK
is neither
less nor greater than AG,
it
is
equal to it, and
(arc BED) :AB^AB:AG.
[The above proof
is presumably due to Dinostratus (if not
to Hippias
himself),

pupil
of

THE QUADRATRIX OF HIPPIAS

flourished
about
350
B.C., that 'is
to
say, some time
before
Euclid,
it
is worth while
to note certain propositions which
are assumed as known.
These are, in addition to the theorem
of
Eucl.
VI.
."3,
the
following:
(1)
the
circumferences
of
circles are
as
their respective
radii;
(2) any arc of a
circle
is
greater than
the chord subtending
it;
(3) any
arc
of a
circle
less than
a
quadrant
is
less than
the portion of the
tangent
at
one extremity
of
the arc
cut
off by the radius
passing through
the
other
extremity.
(2)
and
(3)
are
of
course equivalent to the facts that, if a be the circular measure
of an angle less than a right angle, sin a < a < tan a.]
Even now we have only rectified the
circle.
To square
it
we have to use the proposition
(1) in Archimedes's Measure-
ment of a Circle, to the effect that the area of a circle is equal
to that of a right-angled triangle in which the perpendicular
is equal
to the
radius, and
the
base
to
the
circumference,
of the
circle.
This proposition
is proved by the method of
exhaustion and may have been known
to Dinostratus, who
was later than Eudoxus, if not to Hippias.
The
criticisms
of
Sporus,^
in which
Pappus
concurs,
are
worth quoting
:
(1) 'The very thing for which the construction
is thought
to serve is actually assumed in the hypothesis.
For how is it
possible, with two
points
starting from
B,
to make one of
them move along a straight
line to A and the other along
a circumference to D in an equal time, unless you first know
the ratio of the straight line AB
to the circumference BED ?
In fact this ratio must also be that of the speeds of motion.
For,
if you employ
speeds not
definitely
adjusted
(to
this
ratio), how can
you make
the
motions
end
at
the
same
moment, unless this should sometime happen by pure chance 1
Is not the thing thus shown to be absurd 1
(2) 'Again, the extremity of the curve which they employ
for squaring the
circle, I mean the point in which the curve
cuts the straight line AD, is not found at
all.
For if, in the
figure, the straight lines CB, BA are made to end their motion
together, they will then coincide with AD itself and will not
cut one another any more.
In fact they
cease to intersect
before they coincide with AD, and yet it was the intersection
of these lines which was supposed to give the extremity of the
1 Pappus, iv, pp. 252. 26-254. 22.

230
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE
curve, where it met the straight line AD.
Unless indeed any
one should assert that the curve is conceived to be produced
further, in the same way as we suppose straight lines to be
produced, as
far as AD.
But this does not follow from the
assumptions made;
the point G can only be found by
first
assuming
(as known)
the
ratio
of the
circumference to the
straight
line.'
The second of these objections is undoubtedly sound.
The
point
Cr can
in
fact only be found by applying the method
of exhaustion
in the orthodox Greek manner;
e.g. we may
first bisect the angle of the quadrant, then the half towards
AD,
then
the
half
of
that
and
so
on, drawing each
time
from the points F in which the bisectors cut the quadratrix
perpendiculars FH on AD and
describing
circles with AF
as radius cutting AD in A'.
Then, if we continue this process
long enough, HK will get smaller and smaller and, as 6 lies
between H and K, we can approximate to the position of G as
nearly as we
please.
But
this process
is the equivalent
of
approximating
to
n, which
is
the very
object of the whole
construction.
As regards objection
(1) Hultsch has argued that
it
is not
valid because, with our modern
facilities for making instru-
ments
of precision, there
is no difficulty in making the two
uniform motions take the same time.
Thus an accurate clock
will show the minute hand describing an exact quadrant
in
a definite time, and
it
is quite practicable now to contrive a
uniform
rectilinear motion
taking
exactly
the
same
time.
I
suspect, however, that the
rectilinear motion would be the
result
of converting some one or more circular motions into
rectilinear motions
;
if so, they would involve the use of an
approximate value of rr, in which case the solution would depend
on the assumption of the very thing to be found.
I am inclined,
therefore, to think that both Sporus's objections are valid.
(/3)
The Spiral of Arelilmedes.
We are assured that Archimedes actually used the
spiral
for squaring the circle.
He does in
fact show how to rectify
a
circle by means
of a polar subtangent to the
spiral.
The
spiral
is thus generated
:
suppose that a straight
fine with
one extremity fixed
starts from a fixed position
(the
initial

THE SPIRAL OF ARCHIMEDES
231
line) and revolves uniformly about the fixed extremity, while
a point also moves uniformly along the moving straight line
starting from
the
fixed
extremity
(the
origin)
at the com-
mencement of the straight line's motion
;
the curve described
is a spiral.
The polar equation of the curve is obviously
p = a6.
Suppose that the tangent at any point P
of the
spiral
is
met at T by a straight line drawn from 0, the origin or pole,
perpendicular to the radius vector OF
; then OT is the polar
subtangent.
Now in the book On Spirals Archimedes proves generally
the equivalent of the fact that,
if p be the radius vector to
the point P,
OT = p^/a.
If P
is on the nih turn of the spiral, the moving straight
line will have moved through an angle 2(n â€” 1)77 + 6,
say.
Hence
p â€” a{2(nâ€”l)Tr + 6\,
and
0T=^ p^/a = p{2{n-l)Tr + e\.
Archimedes's way
of expressing
this
is to say (Prop.
20)
that,
if p
be
the
circumference
of
the
circle
with
radius
OP (= p), and if this circle cut the initial line in the point K,
OT â€” (nâ€”l}p + arc KP measured
' forward
' from K to P.
If P is the end of the nth turn, this reduces to
OT = n (circumf. of circle with radius OP),
and, if P is the end of the first turn in particular,
OT â€” (circumf. of circle with radius OP).
(Prop. 19.)
The
spiral can
thus be used
for
the
rectification of any
circle.
And the
quadrature follows
directly from Measure-
inent of a Circle, Prop.
1.

Solutions by A'pollonius and Carpus.
lamblichus says that ApoUonius himself called the curve by
means of which he squared the circle
' sister of the cochloid
'.
What this curve was is uncertain.
As the passage goes on to
say that it was really
' the same as the (curve) of Nicomedes
',
and the quadratrix has just been mentioned as the curve used

232
THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE
by Nicomedes, some have supposed the
' sister of the cochloid
'
(or conchoid) to be the quadratrix, but this seems highly im-
probable.
There
is, however, another possibilitj'.
Apollonius
is known to have written a regular treatise on the
C'ochlias,
which was the
cylindrical
helix.^
It
is conceivable that he
might
call
the
coclilias the
'sister
of
the
cochloid' on
the
ground of the
similarity of the names,
if not of the curves.
And,
as a matter of
fact, the drawing
of a tangent to the
helix enables the circular section of the cylinder to be squared.
For,
if a plane be drawn
at right angles to the axis of.the
cylinder through
the
initial
position of the moving
radius
which
describes
the
helix, and
if we project on
this plane
the portion of the tangent at any point of the helix intercepted
between the point and the plane, the projection
is equal
to
an arc of the circular section of the cylinder subtended by an
angle
at the
centre
equal
to
the
angle through which
the
plane through
the
axis and
the moving radius has turned
from
its
original
position.
And
this
squaring by means
of
what we may call the
' subtangent
'
is sufficiently parallel to
the use by Archimedes of the polar subtangent to the spiral
for the same purpose to make the hypothesis attractive.
Nothing whatever is known
of Carpus's curve
' of double
motion
'.
Tannery thought it was the cycloid
; but there is no
evidence for this.

obtained
the

But we
now learn ^ that, in a work on Flinthides and Cylinders, he
made a nearer approximation
still.

i.e. 3+â€” + â€”^

He observes
that this is almost exactly the mean between the Archimedean
limits 31 and 3if .
It is, however, more exact than this mean,
and Ptolemy no doubt obtained his value independently.
He
had the
basis of the calculation ready
to hand
in
his Table
of Chords.
This

gives
the lengths
of
the chords
of
a

chords are expressed
in terms of

THE SQUARING OF THE CIRCLE
There is evidence of a still closer calculation than Ptolemy's
due to some Greek whose name we do not know.
The Indian
mathematician Aryabhatta (born A.D. 476) says in his Lessons
in Calculation
:
'To
100 add 4;
multiply the sum by
8; add 02000 more
and thus (we have), for a diameter of 2 myriads, the approxi-
mate length of the circumference of the circle
'
;
that is, he gives |Â§Â§ot or 3-1416 as the value of
tt.
But the
way in which he expresses
it points indubitably to a Greek
source,
' for the Greeks alone of
all peoples made the myriad
the unit of the second order
' (Rodet).
This brings us to the notice at the end of Eutocius's com-
mentary on the Measurement of a Circle of Archimedes, which
records ^ that other mathematicians made similar approxima-
tions, though it does not give their results.
' It
is
to be observed that Apollonius
of Perga solved the
same problem
in his 'I2kvt6klov
(" means of quick delivery "),
using
other numbers and making
the approximation
closer
[than that of Archimedes].
While Apollonius's figures seem
to
be more
accurate, they do not
serve the purpose
wliich
Archimedes had
in view
;
for, as we
said, his
object
in this
book was
to find an approximate figure suitable for use
in
daily life.
Hence we cannot regard as appropriate the censure
of Sporus of Nicaea, who seems to charge Archimedes with
having failed to determine with accuracy (the length
of) the
straight line which is equal to the circumference of the circle,
to judge by the passage in his Keria where Sporus observes
that his own teacher, meaning Philon of Gadara, reduced
(the
matter) to more exact numerical expression than Archimedes
did, I mean in his i and if
; in fact people seem, one after the
other, to have failed to appreciate Archimedes's object.
They
have
also used
multiplications and
divisions
of myriads, a
method
not
easy
to follow
for any one who has not gone
through a course of Magnus's Logistica.'
It
is
possible
that,
as
Apollonius
used myriads,
â€¢ second
myriads', 'third myriads', &c., as orders of integral numbers,
he may have worked with the fractions

APPROXIMATIONS TO THE VALUE OF n

in any case Magnus (apparently later than Sporus, and therefore
perhaps belonging
to the fourth or fifth century A. D.) would
seem to have written an exposition of such a method, which,
as
Eutocius
indicates,
must
have
been
very much
more
troublesome than
the method of sexagesimal
fractions used
by Ptolemy.
The
Trisection
of any Angle.
This problem presumably arose from attempts to continue
the construction of regular polygons after that of the pentagon
had
been
discovered.
The
trisection
of an angle would be
necessary
in order
to construct a regular polygon the
sides
of
which
are
nine,
or
any
multiple
of
nine,
in
number.
A regular polygon of seven
sides, on the other hand, would
no doubt be constructed with the help of the first discovered
method
of dividing any angle in a given ratio, i.e. by means
of the quadratrix.
This method covered the case of trisection,
but other more practicable ways of
effecting
this particular
construction were in due time evolved.
We
are
told that
the
ancients attempted, and
failed,
to
solve the problem by 'plane' methods,
i.e. by means
of the
straight
line and
circle
;
they
failed because the problem
is
not
' plane
' but
' solid
'.
Moreover, they were not yet familiar
with
conic
sections,
and
so
were
at
a
loss
;
afterwards,
however, they succeeded
in trisecting an angle by means
of
conic
sections,
a
method
to
which
they
were
led by the
reduction of
the problem
to another, of the kind known as
vâ‚¬vaeis (incliruitiones, or vergings)}
(a)
Reduction
to a certain
pevcris,
solved by
conies.
The reduction is arrived at by the following analysis.
It is
only necessary to deal with the case where the given angle to
be
trisected
is
acute,
since
a
right
angle
can
be
trisected
by drawing an equilateral triangle.
Let ABC be the given angle, and
let AC be drawn perpen-
dicular
to
BC.

the
parallelogram
AOBF,
and

THE TRISECTION OF ANY ANGLE
Suppose E to he such a point that, if BE he joined meeting
AC in D,
the
intercept BE
between AG and AE
is equal
to 2AB.
Bisect DE at G, and join A G.
Then
BG = GE = AG = AB.
Therefore lABG^AAGB=2lAEG
=
2 Z BBC,
since FE, BC are parallel.
Hence
IDBG=^AABC,
and the angle ABC is trisected by BE.
Thus the problem is reduced to drav-ing BE from B to cut
AG tt'iid AE in such a way that the intercept BE = 2^15.
In
the
phraseology
of
the
problems
called
pevareis
the
problem
is
to
insert a
straight
line EB
of
given
length
2AB between AE and AG
in such a way that EB
verges
towards B.
Pappus shows how to solve this problem in a more general
form.
Given a
parallelogram ABGB
(which
need
not
be
rectangular, as Pappus makes
it), to draw AEF to meet CB
and BC produced in points E and F such that EF has a given
lengiji.
Suppose the problem solved, EF being of the given length.
Complete
the
parallelogram
EDGF.
Then, EF being given in length,
BG is given in length.
Therefore G lies on a circle with
centre B and radius equal to the
given length.
Again, by the help of Eucl. I. 43 relating to the complements

REDUCTION TO A NETSIS
237
of
the
parallelograms about
the
diagonal
of
the
complete
parallelogram, we see that
'
BG.CD = BF.ED
= BF. FO.
Consequently G
lies
on
a
hyperbola
with
BF, BA
as
asymptotes and passing through D.
Thus, in order to
effect the construction, we have only to
draw
this hyperbola as well as the circle with centre D and
radius equal to the given length.
Their intersection gives the
point G, and E, -fare then determined by drawing tri'' parallel
to DC to meet BC produced in F and joining AF.

The
veva-Ls equivalent
to a cubic equation.
It is easily seen that the solution of the ceCo-ty is equivalent
to the solution of a cubic equation.
For in the first figure on
p.
236,
if FA be the axis
of
x, FB the axis of
y, FA - a,
FB = h, the solution
of the problem by means of conies as
Pappus gives
it
is the equivalent of finding a certain point
as the intersection of the conies
'
xy = ab,
{x-af-Â¥{y-bf = 4:{a'' + Â¥').
The second equation gives
[x + a){x-Za) = {y + b){3b-y).
From the first equation it is easily seen that
(x + a):iy + b)^a:y,
and that
{x-3a)y = a{b-3y)
;
therefore, eliminating x, we have
a^(b-3y) = y^Sb-y),
or
y^-3by^-3a^y + a^b =
0.
Now suppose that I ABC â€” 6,
so that tan 6 â€” b/a;
and suppose that
t = tan DBG,
so that
y = at.
We have then
aH^-3baH''-3aH + a^b = 0,

TJte Conchoids of Nicomedes.
Nicomedes invented a curve
for
the
specific
purpose
of
solving such uevcreis as the above.
His date can be fixed with
sufficient accuracy by
the
facts
(1) that he seems
to have
criticized unfavourably' Eratosthenes's solution of the problem
of the two mean proportionals or the duplication of the cube,
and
(2)
that Apollonius called a certain curve the
' sister of
the
cochloid
',
evidently
out
of
compliment
to
Nicomedes.
Nicomedes
must
therefore
have
been
about
intermediate
between Eratosthenes (a
little younger than Archimedes, and
therefore born about 280 B.C.) and Apollonius (born probably
about 264 B.C.).
The
curve
is
called by Pappus
the
cochloid
(/coxAoei^ijy
ypa/j-firi), and
this was
evidentlj^ the
original name
for
it
;
later, e.g. by Proclus,
it was called the conchoid
(KoyxoeiSrj^
ypa/ifii]).
There
were
varieties
of
the
cochloidal
curves
;
Pappus speaks
of the
' first
',
' second
',
' third
' and
' fourth
',
observing that the
' first
' was used for trisecting an angle and
duplicating the cube, while the others were useful
for other
investigations.!
It
is
the
'first'
which
concerns
us
here.
Nicomedes constructed
it by means
of a mechanical
device
which may be
described
thus.'^

THE CONCHOIDS OF NICOMEDES

length of the slot in J. i? on each side of F, the extremity P of
the ruler describes the curve which
is
called a conchoid or
cochloid.
Nicomedes
called
the straight
line AB the
ruler
(Kavav), the fixed point G the
j'iole {noXos), and the constant
length PD the distance {Sida-Trnia).
The fundamental property
of
the
curve, which
in
polar
coordinates would now be denoted by the equation
r = a + 5 sec 6,
is that, if any radius vector be drawn from C to the curve, as
GP, the length intercepted on the radius vector between the
curve and the straight line AB is constant.
Thus any veOcns
in which one
of
the two given
lines
(between
which
the
straight line of given length is to be placed) is a straight line
can be solved by means of the intersection of the other
line
with
a
certain
conchoid having as
its pole the fixed point
to which the inserted straight line must verge (veveiv).
Pappus
tells us that in practice the conchoid was not always actually
drawn but that
' some ', for greater convenience, moved a ruler
about the fixed point until by trial the intercept was found to
be equal to the given length.^
In the figure above
(p.
236) showing the reduction of the
trisection
of an angle
to
a
vevai?
the conchoid
to be used
would have B for its 2Mle, AG for the
' ruler
' or base, a length
equal to 2AB for its distance; and E would be found as the
intersection of the conchoid with FA produced.
Proclus
says
that Nicomedes
gave
the
construction,
the
order, and the properties of the conchoidal lines ^
; but nothing

THE TRISECTION OF ANY ANGLE
of
his treatise has come down to us except the construction
of the
' first
' conchoid, its fundamental property, and the fact
that the
curve
has
the
ruler
or
base
as
an
asymptote
in
each
direction.
The
distinction, however, drawn by Pappus
between the
' first
',
' second
',
' third
' and
' fourth
' conchoids
may well have been taken from the original treatise, directly
or indirectly.
We are not told the nature
of the conchoids
other than the
' first ', but
it is probable that they were three
other curves produced by varying the conditions in the figure.
Let a be the distance or fixed intercept between the curve and
the
base,
h
the
distance
of
the pole from
the
base.
Then
clearly,
if along each radius vector drawn through the pole
we measure a backwards
from
the
base towards
the
pole,
we get a conchoidal figure on the
side of the base towards
the
pole.
This
curve takes
three forms according
as a
is
greater
than, equal
to,
or
less than
h.
Each
of
them
has
the base
for asymptote, but
in the
first
of the
three
cases
the curve has a loop as shown
in the
figure,
in the second
case
it has a cusp at the pole, in the third
it has no double
point.
The most probable hypothesis seems
to be that the
other three cochloidal curves mentioned by Pappus are these
three varieties.

Another reduction
to a
i/evais {Archimedes).
A proposition
leading
to the
reduction
of
the
trisection
of an angle to another i^eva-K
is included in the collection of
Lemmas
{Liber Assumptorum) which has come to us under
.

ARCHIMEDES'S SOLUTION
(BY NETSi:S}
241
the name of Archimedes through the Arabic.
Though the
Lemmas cannot have been
written by Archimedes
in
their
present form, because his name
is quoted in them more than
once,
it
is probable that some
of them are of Archimedean
origin, and especially is this the case with Prop.
8, since the
feva-is suggested by it is of very much the same kind as those
the
solution of which is assumed in the treatise O71 Spirals,
Props. 5-8.
The proposition is as follows.
If AB be any chord of a circle with centre 0, and AB be
produced
to C
so
that BC
is
equal to the radius, and if CO
meet the circle in D, E, then the
arc AE will be equal to three
times the arc BD.
Draw the chord EF parallel
to AB, and join OB, OF.
Since BO = BC,
Z BOC = Z BCO.
Now
IC0F=2 10EF,
= 21 BCO, by parallels,
= 2 Z BOC.
Therefore
Z BOF = 3 Z BOD,
and
(arc BF) = (arc AE) = 3 (arc BD).
By means of this proposition we can reduce the trisection of
the arc AE to a
j/ei/o-iy.
For, in order to find an arc which is
one-third of the arc AE, we have only to draw through A
a straight
line ABC meeting the
circle again in B and EO
produced in C, and such that BC is equal to the radius of the
circle.
(e)
Direct solutions by means of conies.
Pappus gives two
solutions
of
the
trisection
problem
in
which
conies
are applied
directly without any preliminary
reduction of the problem to a vevais.^
1. The analysis leading to the first method is as follows.
Let AC be a straight
line, and B a point without
it such
that,
if BA, BC be "joined, the angle BCA
is double
of the
angle BAG.

BD perpendicular to AG, and cut
off DE along BA
equal to DC.
Join BE.
Then, since BE â€” BG,
L BEG = BGE.
But IBEG=IBAE + IEBA,
and, by hypothesis,
IBGA = 2 1BAE.
Therefore
Z BAE + L EBA = 2 Z BAE;
therefore
Z BAE = Z ABE,
or
^A" = BE.
Divide 4C at (? so that AG = 2GG, or P<? = Â§^6'.
Also let FE be made equal to EB, so that

Hence B
lies on a hyperbola with AG as transverse axis
and with conjugate axis equal to

Now suppose we are required
to trisect an arc AB oi
a, circle
with centre 0.
Draw the chord AB, divide
it
at C
so
that AG =2CB,
and

hyperbola
which
has AG for transverse axis and
a straight line equal to V3

Let the hyperbola meet the circular arc in P.

Then, by the above proposition,
IPBA = 2 1PAB.
Therefore their doubles are equal,
or
IP0A = 2 1P0B,
and OP accordingly trisects the arc APB and the angle AOB.
2.
'Some', says Pappus,
set out another
solution not
in-
volving recourse to a vevcns, as follows.
Let MPS be an
arc
of
a
circle which
it
is required
to
trisect.
Suppose
it
done, and
let the arc SP be one-third of the
arc SPR.
Join RP, SP.
Then the angle RSP
is equal
to twice the angle SRP.
Let SE bisect the angle RSP,
"
x
n
"s
meeting RP in E, and draw EX, PN perpendicular to RS.
Then
Z ERS = Z ESR,
so that RE = ES.
Therefore
RX = XS, and X is given.
Again
RS
: ;S'P = RE
: EP = RX
: XX;
therefore
RS
: RX = SP
: NX.
But
RS=2RX;
therefore
SP=2XX.
It follows that P lies on a hyperbola with S as focus and XE
as directrix, and with eccentricity
2.
Hence, in order to trisect the arc, we have only to bisect RS
at X, draw XE at right angles to RS, and then draw a hyper-
bola with S as focus, XE as directrix, and 2 as the eccentricity.
The hyperbola is the same as that used in the first solution.
The passage of Pappus from which this solution
is taken
is
remarkable as being one
of three passages in Greek mathe-
matical works
still extant (two being
in Pappus and one in
a fragment of Anthemius on burning mirrors) which refer to
the focus-and-directrix property of conies.
The second passage
in Pappus comes under the heading of Lemmas to the Surface-
Loci of Euclid.^
Pappus there gives a complete proof of the
1 Pappus, vii, pp. 1004-1114.

theorem that, ifthe distance of a point frortx a fixed jioint
is

its distaiice fro'ni a fiaxd line, the locus of
the point
is a conic
section which
is an ellipse, a parabola,

The importance of these passages
lies
in
the
fact
that
the Lemma was
required
for
the

We
can
hardly
avoid
the conclusion that the property was used by Euclid in his
Surface-Loci, but was assumed as well known.
It was, there-
fore, probably taken from some treatise current
in
Euclid's
time, perhaps from Aristaeus's work on Solid Loci.

(a)
History of the piroblem.
In
his. commentary on
Archimedes, On
the
Sphere and
Cylinder,
II.
1,
Eutocius
has
preserved
for
us
a
precious
collection of solutions
of this famous problem.^
One
of the
solutions
is that of Eratosthenes, a younger contemporary of
Archimedes, and
it
is
introduced by what
purports
to
be
a
letter from
Eratosthenes
to
Ptolemy.
This was Ptolemy
Euergetes, who at the beginning of
his reign (245
B.C.) per-
suaded Eratosthenes to come from Athens to Alexandria to be
tutor to his son
(Philopator).
The supposed letter gives the
tradition regarding the origin of the problem and the history of
its solution up to the time of Eratosthenes.
Then, after some
remarks on
its
usefulness
for practical purposes, the author
describes the construction by which Eratosthenes himself solved
it, giving the proof of
it at some length and adding directions
for making the instrument by which the construction could
be
effected
in
practice.
Next he
says
that
the mechanical
contrivance represented by Eratosthenes was,
' in the votive
monument
', actually of bronze, and was fastened on with lead
close under the
a-Tâ‚¬<pdvr]
of the
pillar.
There
was,
further,
on the pillar the proof in a condensed form, with one figure,
and, at the end, an epigram.
The supposed letter of Eratos-
thenes
is
a
forgery, but the author rendered a real
service
' Archimedes, ed. Heib., vol.
iii, pp. 54. 26-106. 24.

HISTORY OF THE PROBLEM
245
by actually quoting the proof and the epigram, Avliicli are the
genuine work of Eratosthenes.
Our document begins with the story that an ancient tragic
poet had represented Minos as putting up a tomb to Glaucus
but being dissatisfied with
its being only 100
feet each way;
Minos was then represented as saying that
it must be made
double the size, by increasing each of the dimensions in that
ratio.
Naturally the poet
' was thought to have made a mis-
take
'.
Von Wilamowitz
has shown
that the
verses which
Minos
is made
to say cannot have been from any play by
Aeschylus,
Sophocles,
or
Euripides.
They are the work of
some obscure
poet, and the ignorance
of mathematics shown
by him is the only reason why they became notorious and so
survived.
The letter goes on to say that
'Geometers took up
the
question and sought to find out
how one could double a given
solid while keeping the same
shape
; the problem took the name of " the duplication of the
cube " because they started from a cube and sought to double
it.
For a long time
all their efibrts were vain
; then Hippo-
crates
of Chios discovered for the
first time that,
if we can
devise a way of finding two mean proportionals in continued
proportion between two straight
lines the greater
of which
is double
of the
less, the cube
will be doubled; that
is, one
puzzle
{dTToprj/ia} was turned by him
into another not
less
difficult.
After a time, so goes the story, certain Delians, who
were commanded by the oracle to double a certain
altar, fell
into the same quandary as before.'
At this point the versions of the story diverge somewhat.
The pseudo-Eratosthenes continues as follows
:
' They therefore sent over to beg the geometers who were
with Plato in the Academy to find them the solution.
The
latter applying themselves diligently to the problem of finding
two mean
proportionals between
two given
straight
lines,
Archytas of Taras
is said
to have found them by means of
a half cylinder, and Eudoxus by means of the so-called curved
lines
;
but, as it turned out, all their solutions were theoretical,
and no one of them was able to give a practical construction
for ordinary use, save to a certain small extent Menaechmus,
and that with difiiculty.'
Fortunately we have Eratosthenes's own version in a quota-
tion by Theon of Smyrna
:
' Eratosthenes in his work entitled Plaionicus relates that.

246
THE DUPLICATION OF THE CUBE
when the god proclaimed to the Delians by the oracle that, if
they would get rid of a plague, they should construct an altar
double
of
the
existing
one,
their craftsmen
fell
into great
perplexity in their efforts to discover how a solid could be made
double of a
(similar)
solid
; they therefore went to ask Plato
about it, and he replied that the oracle meant, not that the god
wanted an
altar of double the
size, but that he wished,
in
setting them the task, to shame the Greeks for their neglect
of mathematics and their contempt for geometry.'
^
Eratosthenes's version may well be true
; and there
is no
doubt that the question was studied in the Academy, solutions
being attributed
to Eudoxus, Menaechmus, and even (though
erroneously) to Plato himself.
The description by the pseudo-
Eratosthenes of the three solutions by Archytas, Eudoxus and
Menaechmus is little more than a paraphrase of the lines about
them in the genuine epigram of Eratosthenes,
' Do not seek to do the difficult business of the cylinders of
Archytas, or to cut the cones in the triads of Menaechmus, or
to draw such a curved form
of
lines as
is described by the
god-fearing Eudoxus.'
The ditferent versions are reflected in Plutarch, who in one
place gives Plato's answer to the Delians in almost the same
words
as
Eratosthenes,^
and
in
another
place
tells us
that
Plato referred the Delians to Eudoxus and Helicon of Cyzicus
for a solution of the problem.^
After Hippocrates had discovered that the duplication
of
the cube was equivalent to finding two mean proportionals in
continued proportion between two given
straight
lines, the
problem
seems
to
have
been
attacked
in
the
latter form
exclusively.
The various
solutions
will now be reproduced
in chronological
order.
(/3)
Archytas.
The
solution
of Archytas
is the most remarkable
of
all,
especially when his date is considered (first half of fourth cen-
tury B. c), because it is not a construction in a plane but a bold

construction in three dimensions, determining a certain point
as the intersection of three surfaces of revolution, (1)
a right
cone,
(2)
a
cylinder,
(3)
a
tore
or
anchor-ring
with
inner
diameter
nil.
The
intersection
of
the two
latter
surfaces
gives (says Archytas) a certain curve (which is in fact a curve
of double curvature), and the point required
is found as the
point in which the cone meets this curve.
Suppose that AC, AB are the two straight
lines between
which two mean proportionals are to be found, and let ^C be
made the diameter of a circle and AB
a, chord in it.
Draw a semicircle with AG &b diameter, but in a plane at
right angles to the plane of the circle ABG, and imagine this
semicircle
to
revolve
about a
straight
line through A per-
pendicular to the plane
of ABC (thus describing half a
tore
with inner diameter nil).
Next draw a right half-cylinder on the semicircle ABG as
base
;
this
will cut the surface of the hali-tore in a certain
curve.
Lastly let CD, the tangent to the circle ABC at the point C,
meet AB produced in JD; and suppose the
triangle ABC to
revolve about AC as
axis.
This
will generate
the
surface
of a right circular cone
; the point B will describe a semicircle
BQE
at
right angles
to
the
plane
of ABG and having
its
diameter BE at right angles to AG; and the surface of the
cone will meet in some point P the curve which
is the inter-
section of the half-cylinder and the half-fore.

248
THE DUPLICATION OF THE CUBE
Let APC" be the corresponding position of the
revolving
semicircle, and let AG' meet the circumference ABC in M.
Drawing F3I perpendicular to the plane
of ABC, we see
that it must meet the circumference of the circle ABC because
P is on the cylinder which stands on ABC as base.
Let AP meet the circumference of the semicircle BQE in Q,
and let AC meet its diameter in
iV".
Join PC, QM, QX.
Then, since both semicircles are perpendicular to the plane
ABC, so is their line of intersection QN [Eucl. XI. 19].
Therefore QN is perpendicular to BE.
Therefore
QN^ = BIf
. NE = AN. JVM,
[Eucl. III. 35]
so that the angle AQM is a right angle.
But the angle APC is also right
;
therefore MQ is parallel to CP.
It follows, by similar triangles, that
CA:AP= AP:AM= AM:AQ;
that is,
AC -.AP^AP: AM = AM: AB,
and AB, AM, AP, AC are
in continued
proportion, so that
A3I, AP are the two mean proportionals required.
In the language
of
analytical geometry, if AC is the axis
of
X, a
line through A perpendicular to AC in the plane of
ABC the axis of y, and a line through A parallel to PM the
axis
of
c,
then P
is determined
as
the
intersection of the
surfaces

x^ + y^ + z- = ~x^,

(2)
x^ + y^ = ax,

(3)
a;2 + 2/2 + 02 =

(the tore)
where
AC â€” a,

From the first two equations we obtain

Compounding the ratios, we have

therefore the cube of side A3I is to the cube of side AB as AG
is to AB.
In the
particular
case where AG = 2AB, AM^ = 2AB^,
and the cube is doubled.

Eudoxus.
Eutocius had evidently seen some document purporting to
give
Eudoxus's
solution, but
it
is
clear
that
it must have
been
an
erroneous
version.
The
epigram
of
Eratosthenes
says
that
Eudoxus
solved
the
problem by means
of
lines
of
a
'curved
or bent form'
(Ka^TrvXov
elSos
iv
ypanfials).
According
to
Eutocius,
while Eudoxus
said
in
his
preface
that he had discovered a solution by means of
' curved lines
',
yet, when he came
to
the
proof,
he made no use
of such
lines, and further he committed an obvious error in that he
treated a certain discrete proportion as if it were continuous.^
It may be that, while Eudoxus made use of what was really
a curvilinear locus, he did not actually draw the whole curve
but only indicated a point or two upon
it sufficient for his
purpose.
This may explain the first part of Eutocius's remark,
but in any case we cannot believe the second part
; Eudoxus
was too accomplished a mathematician to make any confusion
between a discrete and a continuous proportion.
Presumably
the mistake which
Eutocius found was made by some one
who wrongly transcribed the
original
; but
it cannot be too
much regretted, because it caused Eutocius to omit the solution
altogether from his account.
Tannery ^ made an ingenious suggestion to the
effect that
Eudoxus's
construction
was
really
adapted
from
that
of
Archytas by what
is
practically
projection
on
the
plane
of the circle ABG in Archytas's construction.
It is not difficult
to represent
the
projection on
that
plane
of
the curve
of
intersection between the cone and
the
tore,
and, when
this
curve
is drawn in the plane ABG,
its intersection with the
circle ABG itself gives the point M in Archytas's figure.

i, pp. 53-61.

THE DUPLICATION OF THE CUBE
The projection on the plane ABC of the intersection between
the
cone and
the
tore
is
seen, by means of their equations
(1) and
(3)
above,
to be
x^ = â€” Vix^ + y-),
a
or, in polar coordinates referred to A as origin and ^C as axis,
62
P =
a cos^ 6
'
It is easy to find any number of points on the curve.
Take
the
circle ABG, and
let AC the diameter and AB a chord
B
M,
be
the
two given
straight
lines between which two mean
proportionals have to be found.
With the above notation
AC = a,
AB = b;
and, if BFhe drawn perpendicular to AC,
AB'' = AF.AC,
or
AF=b^/a.
Take any point G on BF and join AG.
Then, if
Z GAF =6,
AG = AF sec 6.
With A as centre and
J. (7 as radius draw a circle meeting
AC in H, and draw HL at right angles to AC, meeting AG
produced in L.

EUDOXUS.
MENAECHMUS
251
Then
AL = AHsecO = AOsece = AFsec^e.
7,2
That is, if
p = AL,
p = â€” sec^^,
and Z is a point on the curve.
Similarly any number of other points on the curve may be
found.
If the curve meets the
circle ABC in M, the length
^^
is the same as that
of AM in
the
figure of Archytas's
solution.
And AM is the first of the two mean proportionals between
AB and AC.
The second (= ^P in the figure of Archytas's
solution)
is easily found from the relation AM^ = AB
. AP,
and the problem is solved.
It must
be
admitted
that
Tannery's
suggestion
as
to
Eudoxus's method is attractive
; but of course it is only a con-
jecture.
To my mind the objection to it is that it is too close
an adaptation of Archytas's ideas.
Eudoxus was,
it
is
true,
a pupil of Archytas, and there
is a good deal of similarity
of character between Archytas's construction of the curve of
double curvature and Eudoxus's construction of the spherical
lemniscate by means
of
revolving
concentric
spheres;
but
Eudoxus was, I think, too original a mathematician
to con-
tent himself with
a mere adaptation of Archytas's method
of
solution.
(S)
Menaechmus.
Two
solutions by Menaechmus
of the problem
of finding
two mean proportionals are described by Eutocius
; both find
a
certain point
as
the
intersection between
two
conies,
in
the
one
case two
parabolas,
in
the
other
a
parabola
and
a
rectangular
hyperbola.
The
solutions
are
referred
to
in
Eratosthenes's epigram
:
' do not
', says Eratosthenes,
' cut the
cone
in
the
triads
of
Menaechmus.'
From
the
solutions
coupled with
this remark
it
is
inferred
that Menaechmus
was the discoverer of the conic sections.
Menaechmus, brother of Dinostratus, who used the quadra-
trix to square the circle, was a pupil of Eudoxus and flourished
about the middle of the fourth century B. C.
The most attrac-
tive form of the story about the geometer and the king who
wanted a short cut to geometry is told of Menaechmus and

253
THE DUPLICATION OF THE CUBE
Alexander
:
'
king,' said Menaechmus,
' for travelling over
the
country there
are
royal
roads
and
roads
for common
citizens, but in geometry there is one road for all.' ^ A similar
story is indeed told of Euclid and Ptolemy
; but there would
be a temptation to transfer such a story at a later date to
the more famous mathematician.
Menaechmus was evidently
a considerable mathematician
; he is associated by Proclus with
Amyclas of Heraclea, a friend of Plato, and with Dinostratus
as
having
' made
the
whole
of
geometry more
perfect '.^
Beyond, however,
the
fact that
the
discovery
of
the
conic
sections is attributed to him, we have very few notices relating
to
his
work.
He
is
mentioned along
with
Aristotle
and
Callippus as a supporter of the theory of concentric spheres
invented by Eudoxus, but as postulating a larger number of
spheres."
We
gather
from
Proclus
that
he
wrote on
the
technology
of
mathematics;
he
discussed
for
instance
the
difference between the broader meaning of the word element
(in which any
proposition
leading
to another may be
said
to be an element of
it) and the stricter meaning of something
simple and fundamental standing to consequences drawn from
it
in the relation
of a principle, which
is capable of being
universally applied and enters into the proof of
all manner
of propositions.*
Again, he did not agree in the distinction
between theorems and problems, but would have it that they
were
all problems, though directed
to two different objects ^
;
he also discussed the important question of the convertibility
of theorems and the conditions necessary to
it.''
If
X,
y
are
two
mean
proportionals
between
straight
lines
a,
b,
that
is,
if
a:x = x:y = y: b,
then clearly
x'^ = ay,
y"^ â€” bx,
and
xy = ab.
It
is easy for us to recognize here the Cartesian equations
of two parabolas referred to a diameter and the tangent at its
extremity,
and
of a hyperbola
referred
to
its
asymptotes.
But Menaechmus appears to have had not only to recognize,

but to discover, the existence of curves having the properties
corresponding
to
the
Cartesian
equations.
He
discovered
them in plane sections of right circular cones, and
it would
doubtless
be
the
properties
of
the
^jrwicijja^
ordinates
in
relation to the abscissae on the axes which he would arrive
at
first.
Though only
the parabola and the hyperbola are
^vanted
for the
particular
problem, he would certainly
not
fail to find the
ellipse and
its property as well.
But in the
ease
of the hyperbola he needed the property
of the curve
with reference to the asymptotes, represented by the equation
xy = ab; he must therefore have discovered the existence of
the asymptotes, and must have proved the property, at
all
events for the rectangular hyperbola.
The original method
of discovery of the conies will occupy us later.
In the mean-
time
it
is
obvious
that
the
use
of any two
of the curves
x^ = ay, y^ = hx, xy â€” ah gives the solution of our problem,
and
it was
in fact the intersection of the second and third
which Menaechmus used in his
first
solution, while
for his
second
solution he used
the
first
two.
Eutocius
gives
the
analysis and synthesis of each solution in full.
I shall repro-
duce them as shortly as possible, only suppressing the use of
four separate lines representing the two given straight lines
and the two required means in the figure of the first solution.
-
First solution.
Suppose that J.0, 0-B are two given straight lines of which
AO > OB, and let them form a right angle at 0.
Suppose the problem solved, and let the two mean propor-
tionals be OM measured along BO produced and ON measured
along AO produced.
Complete the rectangle OMPN.
Then, since
AO :0M = OM:ON = ON:OB,
we have (1)
OB .OM = ON^ = PM\
so that P lies on a parabola which has
for vertex,
If for
axis, and OB for latus rectum
;
and (2)
AO.OB = OM.ON=PN.PM,
so that P lies on a hyperbola with
as centre and OM, OiV" as
asymptotes.

254
THE DUPLICATION OF THE CUBE
Accordingly,
to
find
the
point
P, we have
to
construct
(1) a parabola with
as vertex, OM as axis, and latus rectum
equal to OB,
(2)
a hyperbola
with asymptotes OM, OX and
such
that
the
rectangle
contained
by
straight
lines PM, PX drawn
from any point P on the curve parallel to one asymptote and
meeting the other is equal to the rectangle AO
. OB.
The intersection
of the parabola and hyperbola gives the
point P which solves the problem, for
AO:PN = PN PM = PM: OB.
Second
solution.
Supposing the problem solved, as in the
tirst case, we have,
since
AO -.OM = OM -.ON = ON:OB,
(1) the relation OB
. OM = OX- = PM-\
y

MENAECHMUS AND CONICS
255
so that P lies on a parabola which has
for vertex, OM for
axis, and OB for latus rectum,
(2)
the similar relation AO.ON = OM'^ = PN^,
so that P
lies on a parabola which has
for vertex, ON for
axis, and OA for lahis rectuTn.
In order therefore to find P, we have only to construct the
two parabolas with OM, ON for axes and OB, OA for latera
recta respectively
; the intersection of the two parabolas gives
a point P such that
AO:PN^ PN:PM = PM
: OB,
and the problem is solved.
(We
shall see
later on
that Menaechmus did not use the
names 23a'rabola and hyperbola
to
describe the curves, those
names being due to Apollonius.)
(e)
TAe solution attributed
to Plato.
This
is the
first in Eutocius's arrangement of the various
solutions reproduced by him.
But there
is almost conclusive
reason
for thinking that
it
is wrongly attributed to
Plato.
No one but Eutocius mentions
it, and there is no reference to
it
in Eratosthenes's epigram, whereas,
if a solution by Plato
had
then
been
known,
it
could
hardly
fail
to have been
mentioned
along with
those
of Archytas, Menaechmus, and
Eudoxus.
Again, Plutarch says that Plato told the Delians
that the problem
of the two mean proportionals was no easy
one, but that Eudoxus or Helicon of Cyzicus would solve
it
for them
; he did not apparently propose to attack it himself.
And,
lastly,
the
solution
attributed
to
him
is
mechanical,
whereas we are twice told that Plato objected to mechanical
solutions
as
destroying
the
good
of
geometry.^
Attempts
have been made to
reconcile the contrary
traditions.
It
is
argued that, while Plato objected to mechanical solutions on
principle, he wished
to show how easy
it was
to
discover
such solutions and put forward that attributed to him as an
illustration
of
the
fact.
I
prefer
to
treat
the
silence
of
Eratosthenes as conclusive on the
point, and to suppose that
the
solution was invented in the Academy by some one con-
temporary with or later than Menaechmus.

256
THE DUPLICATION OF THE CUBE
For, if we look at the figure of Menaechmus's second solu-
tion, we
shall see that the given straight lines and the two
means between them
are shown
in
cyclic order
(clockwise)
as
straight
lines radiating from
and
separated by right
angles.
This
is
exactly
the
arrangement
of
the
lines
in
' Plato's
'
solution.
Hence
it seems probable that some one
who had Menaechmus's
second
solution
before him wished
to show how
the same
representation
of
the
four straight
lines could be got by a mechanical construction as an alterna-
tive to the use of conies.
Drawing the two given straight lines with the means, that
is to
say, OA, OM, ON, OB, in cyclic clockwise order, as in
Menaechmus's second solution, we have
AO:OM= OM: ON = ON: OB,
and
it
is
clear
that,
if AM, MN, NB are joined,
the angles
AMN, MNB
are
both
right
angles.
The problem then
is,
given OA, OB at right angles to one another, to contrive the
rest of the figure so that the angles at M, N are right.
The instrument used
is somewhat like that which a shoe-
maker uses to measure the length of the foot. FGH is a rigid
right angle made, say, of wood.
KL is a strut which, fastened,
say,
to a
stick KF which slides along GF, can move while
remaining always parallel to GH or at right angles to GF.
Now place the rigid right angle FGH so that the leg GE
passes through
B, and turn
it
until the angle G lies on ilO

produced.
Then
slide, the movable strut KL, which remains
always
parallel
to GH,
until
its edge
(towai-ds Gli) passes
through A.
If now
the
inner angular point between
the
strut KL
and
the
leg FG
does not
lie on BO
produced,
the
machine
has
to be turned
again and the
strut moved
until the said point does lie on BO produced, as M, care being
taken that during the whole
of the motion the inner edges
of KL and HG pass through A, B respectively and the inner
angular point at G moves along AO produced.
That
it
is possible for the machine to take up the desired
position
is
clear from the
figure
of Menaechmus,
in which
MO, NO are the means between AO and BO and the angles
AMN, MNB
are
right
angles,
although
to get
it into the
required position is perhaps not quite easy.
The matter may be looked
at analytically
thus.
Let us
take any other position of the machine in which the strut and
the leg GH pass through A, B respectively, while G lies on AO
produced, but P, the angular point between the strut KL and
the leg FG, does not
lie on OM produced.
Take ON, OM as
the axes of x, y respectively.
Draw PR perpendicular to OG,
and produce GP to meet OM produced in
>S'.
Let
AO = a,
BO =
b,
OG = r.

P, a curve of the third degree,

The intersection {M) of this curve with the axis of y gives
OM^ = a^b.

solution,

solution
is
more difficult than that of Menaechmus.

Nicomedes reduced the problem to a vivais which he solved
by means of the conchoid.

(a) With Apollonius's and Heron's constructions we have, if
K be the middle point of AB,
AF.FB + Bir- = FK\
Add KE'^ to both sides
;
therefore
AF.FB + BE'' = EF'\
Similarly
AG.GC+ CE- = EG '--
But BE = CE, and EF=EG;
therefore
AF.FB = AG.OC.
(6) With Philon's construction, since GH = FD,
HF.FD = DG.GH.
But, since the circle BDHO passes through A,
HF. FD = AF. FB, and DG.GH =^ AG.GC;
therefore
AF.FB = AG.GC.
Therefore
FA:AG = CG
: FB.
But, by similar triangles,
FA
: AG = DC: CG, and also =:FB:BD;
therefore
DC
: CG = CG :FB = FB: BD,
or
AB
: CG = CG:FB = FB: AC.
The connexion between this solution and that of Menaech-
mus can be seen thus.
We saw that, if a:x = x:y = y.b,
a;2 = ay,
y^ = hr,
xy = ah,
which
equations
represent,
in
Cartesian
coordinates,
two
parabolas and a hyperbola.
Menaechmus in effect solved -the

264
THE DUPLICATION OF THE CUBE
problem of the two mean proportionals by means of the points
of intersection of any two of these conies.
But, if we add the first two equations, we have
x^ + y'^â€” bx â€” ay =
0,
which
is a
circle passing through the points common to the
two parabolas x^ = ay,
y^ = hx.
Therefore we
can equally obtain
a
solution by means
of
the intersections
of the
circle
x^ + y'^-hx-ay =^
and the
rectangular hyperbola xy = ab.
This
is in
effect what Philon
does, for, if AF, AG are the
coordinate axes,
the
circle
x'^ + y^ â€” bx â€” ay=0
is the
circle
BDHC,
and
xy = ab
is
the
rectangular
hyperbola
with
AF, AG
as
asymptotes
and
passing
through
D,
which
hyperbola
intersects
the
circle
again
in
H,
a
point
such
that FD = HG.
(i)
Diodes and
the
cissoid.
We gather from
allusions to the cissoid in Proclus's com-
mentary on Eucl. I that the curve which Geminus called by
that name was none other than the curve invented by Diodes
and used by him
for doubling the cube or finding two mean
proportionals.
Hence Diodes must have preceded Geminus
(fl.
70
B.C.).
Again, we
conclude
from
the two fragments
preserved by Eutocius
of a work by him, nepl
irvpeLcov, On
burning-mirrors,
that
he was
later than Archimedes and
Apollonius.
He may
therefore have
flourished towards the
end
of the
second century or
at the beginning of the
first
century
B.C.
Of the two fragments given by Eutocius one
contains a
solution by means
of
conies
of
the problem
of
dividing a sphere by a plane in such a way that the volumes
of the resulting segments shall be in a given ratioâ€” a problem
equivalent to the solution of a certain cubic equationâ€”while
the other gives the solution of the problem of the two mean
proportionals by means of the cissoid.
Suppose
that AB, DC are
diameters
of
a
circle
at right
angles to one another.
Let E, F be points on the quadrants
BB, BG respectively such that the arcs BE, BF are equal.
Draw EG, FH perpendicular to DC.
Join CE, apd let P be
the point in which CE, FH intersect.

DIOCLES AND THE CISSOID
265
The cissoid is the locus of all* the points P corresponding to
different positions of E on the quadrant BD and of F at an
equal distance from B on the quadrant BC.
If P
is any point found by the above construction,
it
is
G

266
THE DUPLICATION OF THE CUBE
Suppose now tliat the cissoid has been drawn as shown by
the dotted line in the figure, and that we are required to find
two mean proportionals between two straight lines a,
h.
Take the point K on OB such that DO :0K = a:b.
Join DK, and produce it to meet the cissoid in Q.
Through Q draw the ordinate LM perpendicular to DC.
Then, by the property of the
cissoid, Lit MC are the two
mean proportionals between DM, MQ.
And
DM:MQ = DO:OK = a:h.
In order, then, to obtain the two mean proportionals between
a and h, we have only to take straight lines which bear respec-
tively the same ratio to DM, LM, MC, MQ as a bears to DM.
The extremes are then .a,
b, and the two mean proportionals
are found.

Sj'xirus and Papinis.
The solutions of Sporus and Pappus are really the same as
that of Diodes, the only difference being that, instead of using
the cissoid, they use a ruler which they turn about a certain
point until certain
intercepts which
it
cuts off between two
pairs of lines are equal.
In order to show the identity of the solutions, I shall draw
Sporus's
figure
. with
the same
lettering as above
for corre-
sponding
points, and
I
shall
add
dotted
lines
to show the
additional auxiliary lines used by Pappus. '^
(Compared with
my figure, Sporus's
is the other way up, and so
is Pappus's,
where it occui-s in his own Synagoge, though not in Eutocius.)
Sporus was known to Pappus, as we have gathered from
Pappus's reference
to his criticisms on the
quaclratrix, and
it is not unlikely that Sporus was either Pappus's master or
a fellow-student
of
his.
But when pappus gives (though in
better form,
if we may judge by Eutocius's reproduction
of
Sporus)
the same
solution
as that
of
Sporus, and
calls
it
a
solution
KaO'
rjuds, he
clearly means
' according
to my
method
', not
' our method
', and it appears therefore that he
claimed the credit of it for himself.
Sporus makes DO, OK (at right angles to one another) the
actual given
straight lines;

Otherwise the construction

DM:MQ = GM^:MQ\
But
DM:MQ = DO:OK,

Therefore DO

Therefore OT is the
first of the two mean proportionals

to DO, OT.

ZENO OF ELBA
We have already seen how the consideration of the subject
of infinitesimals was forced upon the Greek mathematicians so
soon
as they came
to
close grips with the problem
of
the
quadrature of the circle.
Antiphon the Sophist was the first
to indicate the correct road upon which the
solution was to
be found, though he expressed his idea in a crude form which
was bound to provoke immediate and strong criticism from
logical minds.
Antiphon had inscribed a series of successive
regular polygons
in a
circle, .each
of which had double
as
many
sides
as the preceding, and he asserted
that, by con-
tinuing this process, we should at length exhaust the
circle
:
'he thought that
in
this way the area
of
the
circle would
sometime be used up and a polygon would be inscribed in the
circle the sides of which on account of their smallness would
coincide with the circumference.' ^
Aristotle roundly said that
this was a
fallacy which
it was not
even
necessary for a
geometer to trouble
to refute, since an expert in any science
is not called upon to refute all fallacies, but only those which
are
false
deductions
from
the
admitted
principles
of
the
science
;
if the fallacy is based on anything which
is in con-
tradiction to any of those principles, it may at once be ignored.^
Evidently therefore, in Aristotle's view, Antiphon's argument
violated some
' geometrical principle
', whether this was the
truth that a straight
line, however short, can never coincide
with an arc of a circle, or the principle assumed by geometers
that geometrical magnitudes can be divided ad infinitum.
But
Aristotle
is
only
a
representative
of
the
criticisms
directed against the ideas implied
in Antiphon's argument;
those
ideas had

as early
as
the time
of Antiphon

himself
(a contemporary
of
Socrates), been
subjected
to
a
destructive
criticism expressed with unsurpassable piquancy
and
force.
No wonder that the subsequent course of Greek
geometry was profoundly affected by the arguments of Zeno
on motion.
Aristotle indeed called them
'fallacies', without
being able to refute them.
The mathematicians, however, knew
better,
and,
realizing
that
Zeno's
arguments were
fatal
to
infinitesimals, they saw that they could only avoid the
diffi-
culties connected with them by once for all banishing the idea
of the infinite, even the
potentially
infinite, altogether from
their science
;
thenceforth,
therefore, they made
no
use
of
magnitudes increasing or diminishing ad infinitum, but con-
tented themselves with finite magnitudes that can be made as
great or as small as we j^lease.^
If they used infinitesimals
at all, it was only as a tentative means of discovering proposi-
tions
; they proved them afterwards by rigorous geometrical
methods.
An illustration of this is furnished by the Method of
Archimedes.
In that treatise Archimedes finds
(a) the areas
of
curves, and
(b)
the volumes
of
solids, by treating them
respectively as the sums of an infinite number
(a)
of parallel
lines,
i.e.
infinitely narrow
strips, and
(6)
of parallel plajies,
i. e. infinitely thin laminae
; but he plainly declares that this
method
is only useful for
discovering results and does
not
furnish a proof of them, but that to establish them scientific-
ally a geometrical proof by the method
of exhaustion, with
its double reductio ad absurdam, is still necessary.
Notwithstanding that the criticisms of Zeno had so impor-
tant an influence upon
the
lines
of development
of Greek
geometry,
it
does not appear that Zeno himself was
really
a mathematician or even a physicist.
Plato mentions a work
of his
(to. tov
ZTJi/ccfos ypd/i/xaTa, or to (TvyypafjLp.a) in terms
which imply that
it was
his only known work.^
Simplicius
too knows only one work of
his, and
this the same as that
mentioned by Plato ^
; when Suidas mentions four, a Commen-
tary on or Exposition of Em,pedocles,
Controversies, Against
the philosophers and On Nature, it may be that the last three
titles are only
diflferent designations for the one work, while
the book on Empedocles may have been wrongly attributed

Plato
puts
into
the mouth
oi:
Zeno
himself an
explanation of the character and object of his book.^
It was
a youthful effort, and
it was stolen by some one, so that the
author had no opportunity of considering whether to publish
it or not.
Its object was to defend the system of Parmenides
by attacking the common conceptions of things.
Parmenides
held
that
only
the One
exists;
whereupon common
sense
pointed out
that many
contradictions
and
absurdities
will
follow
if this be admitted.
Zeno replied
that, if the popular
view that Many exist be accepted,
still more absurd results
will follow.
The work was divided into several parts (Aoyot
according
to
Plato)
and each
of
these
again
into
sections
('hypotheses' in
Plato, 'contentions',
kTn-)(^iLprjiiaTa, in Sim-
plicius)
:
each
of
the
latter
(which
according
to
Proclus
numbered
forty
in
alP)
seems
to
have
taken
one
of
the
assumptions made on the ordinary view of
life and to have
shown
that
it
leads
to
an
absurdity.
It
is
doubtless
on
account of this systematic use of indirect proof by the reductio
ad ahsurdum of particular hypotheses that Zeno
is
said
to
have been
called by Aristotle
the
discoverer
of
Dialectic*;
Plato, too, says of him that he understood how to make one
and the same thing appear like and unlike, one and many, at
rest and in motion.Â®
Zeno's arguments about motion.
It does not appear that the
full significance and value
of
Zeno's paradoxes have
ever
been
realized
until these
latter
days.
The most modern view of them shall be expressed in
the writer's own words

one and all sophisms.
After two thousand years of continual
refutation,
these
sophisms
were
reinstated,
and made
the
foundation
of
a
mathematical
renaissance,
by
a
German
professor who
probably
never
dreamed
of any
connexion
between himself and Zeno.
Weierstrass, by strictly banishing
all
infinitesimals,
has
at
last shown
that we
live
in
an
unchanging world, and that the arrow, at every moment of its
flight, is truly at
rest.
The only point where Zeno probably
erred was
in inferring
(if he
did
infer)
that, because there
is no change, the world must be in the same state at one time
as at another.
This consequence by no means follows, and in
this point the German professor is more constructive than the
ingenious
Greek.
Weierstrass,
being
able
to embody
his
opinions in mathematics, where familiarity with truth elimi-
nates the vulgar prejudices of common sense, has been able to
give to his propositions the respectable air of platitudes
; and
if the result is less delightful to the lover of reason than Zeno's
bold defiance, it is at any rate more calculated to appease the
mass of academic mankind.' ^
Thus, while in the past the arguments
of Zeno have been
treated with more or less disrespect as mere sophisms, we have
now come to the other extreme.
It appears to be implied that
Zeno anticipated Weierstrass.
This, I think, a calmer judge-
ment must pronounce to be incredible.
If the arguments of
Zeno
are found
to be 'immeasurably
subtle and profound'
because they contain ideas which Weierstrass used to create
a great mathematical theory, it does not follow that for Zeno
they meant at all the same thing as for Weierstrass.
On the
contrary, it
is probable that Zeno happened upon these ideas
without realizing any of the
significance which Weierstrass
was destined
to give them
; nor shall we give Zeno any less
credit on this account.
It
is time to come to the arguments themselves.
It is the
four
arguments
on
the
subject
of
motion which
are most
important from the point of view of the mathematician
; but
they have points of contact with the arguments which Zeno
used
to prove the non-existence
of Many,
in
refutation
of
those who attacked Parmenides's doctrine of the One.
Accord-
ing to
Simplicius, he showed that,
if Many exist, they must

be both great and small, so great on the one hand as to be
infinite in
size and
so small on the other as to have no size.^
To prove the latter of these
contentions, Zeno
relied on the
infinite
divisibility
of bodies
as
evident
;
assuming
this, he
easily proved that division will continually give smaller and
smaller parts, there will be no limit to the diminution, and, if
there is a final element, it must be absolutely nothing.
Conse-
quently to add any number of these m^-elements to anything
will not
increase
its
size, nor
will the subtraction
of them
diminish
it
; and of course to add them to one another, even
in
infinite
number,
will
give nothing
as
the
total.
(The
second horn of the dilemma, not apparently stated by Zeno
in this form, would be tliis.
A critic might argue that infinite
division would only lead to parts having some size, so that the
last element would
itself have some size
;
to this the answer
would be
that, as there would, by hypothesis, be an
infinite
number
of
such
parts,
the
original
magnitude
which was
divided would be
infinite in
size.)
The
connexion between
the arguments
against the Many and those against motion
lies in the
fact that the former
rest on the assumption
of
the
divisibility of matter acl infinittim, and that this
is the
hypothesis assumed in the first two arguments against motion.
We shall see that, while the
first two arguments proceed on
this hypothesis, the last two appear to proceed on the opposite
hypothesis that space and time are not infinitely divisible, but
that they are composed of indivisible elements
; so that the
four arguments form a complete dilemma.
The four arguments against motion shall be stated in the
words of Aristotle.
I. The Dichotomy.
'There
is no motion because
that which
is moved must
arrive
at the middle
(of
its course)
before
it arrives at the
end.' ^
(And of course
it must traverse the half of the half
before it reaches the middle, and so on ud infinitum.)
II. The Achilles.
'This
asserts that the slower when running will never be
1 Simpl. in Phys., p. 139. 5, Diels.

overtaken by the quicker;
for that which
is pursuing must
first reach the point from which that which is fleeing started,
so that the slower must necessarily always be some distance
ahead.' ^
III. The Arrow.
' If, says Zeno, everything is either at rest or moving when
it occupies a space equal (to itself), while the object moved
is
always in the instant
(eari
S' dit to
(pipojievov kv
tco
vvv, in
the nmv), the moving arrow is unmoved.' ^
I agree in Brochard's interpretation of
this passage,^ from
which Zeller * would banish
fj
KLveirai,
' or
is moved
'.
The
argument is this.
It is strictly impossible that the arrow can
move in the instant, supposed indivisible, for, if it changed its
position,
the
instant would
be
at
once
divided.
Now
the
moving object
is, in the instant, either at rest
or in motion
;
but, as it is not in motion,
it
is at rest, and as, by hypothesis,
time
is composed of nothing but instants, the moving object is
always
at
rest.
This
interpretation
has
the
advantage
of
agreeing with
that
of
Simplicius,'' which
seems
preferable
to that of Themistius ^ on which Zeller relies.
IV. The Stadium.
I
translate the
first two
sentences
of
Aristotle's account
''
:
' The fourth
is the argument concerning the two rows of
bodies each composed of an equal number of bodies of equal
size, M'hich pass one another on a race-course as they proceed
with equal velocity in opposite
directions, one row
starting
from
the end
of the course and the other from the middle.
This, he thinks, involves the conclusion that half a given time
is equal
to
its double.
The fallacy of the reasoning
lies in
the assumption
that an
equal
magnitude occupies an equal
time in passing with equal
velocity a magnitude that
is in
motion and a magnitude that is at rest, an assumption which
is false.'
Then
follows
a
description
of
the
process by means
of

lengths which are indeterminate.
In the first and third there
is only one moving object, and it is shown that it cannot even
begin to move.
The second and fourth, comparing the motions
of two
objects, make
the absurdity
of- the hypothesis even
more palpable, so to speak, for they prove that the movement,
even if
it has once begun, cannot continue, and that relative
motion is no less impossible than absolute motion.
The first
two establish the impossibility of movement by the nature of
space, supposed continuous, without any implication that time
is otherwise than continuous in the same way as space
;
in the
last two
it
is the nature
of time
(considered as made up of
indivisible
elements
or
instants) which
serves
to prove the
impossibility of movement, and without any implication that
space is not likewise made up of indivisible elements or points.
The second argument
is only another form of the
first, and
the fourth rests on the same principle as the third.
Lastly, the
first pair proceed on the
hj'pothesis that continuous magni-
tudes are
divisible ad infinitum
;
the second
pair give
the
other horn of the dilemma, being directed against the assump-
tion that continuous magnitudes are made up of
indivisible
elements, an assumption which would scarcely suggest
itself
to
the imagination
until
the
difficulties connected with
the
other were fully realized.
Thus the logical order of the argu-
ments corresponds
exactly
to
the
historical order
in which
Aristotle has handed them down and which was certainly the
order adopted by Zeno.
Whether or not the paradoxes had for Zeno the profound
meaning now claimed
for them,
it
is
clear that they have
been very generally misunderstood, with the result that the
criticisms directed against them have been wide of the mark.
Aristotle,
it
is
true, saw
that the
first two arguments, the
Dichotomy and the Achillea, come to the same thing, the latter
differing from the former only in the fact that the ratio of
each space traversed by Achilles to the preceding space
is not
that of
1
: 2 but a ratio of
1
: n, where n may be any number,
however large
;
but, he saj^s, both proofs rest on the fact that
a certain moving object
' cannot reach the end of the course if
the magnitude
is divided
in a certain way'.^

passage shows that he mistook the character of the argument

divisible
in
exactly the same way
as a length
;
if therefore a length
is
infinitely
divisible,
so
is
the
corresponding
time;
he
adds
' this is why
(Sio) Zeno's argument falsely assuiiies that
it
is
not possible to traverse or touch each of an infinite number of
points in a finite time V thereby implying that Zeno did not
regard time as divisible ad infinituvi like space.
Similarly,
when
Leibniz
declares
that a
space
divisible ad infinitum
is traversed in a time divisible ad infinitum,, he, like Aristotle,
is entii-ely beside the question.
Zeno was perfectly aware that,
in
respect
of
divisibility,
time
and
space
have
the
same
property, and that they are
alike, always, and concomitantly,
divisible ad infinitwm.
The
cLuestion
is how, in the one as
in the other, this series of divisions, by definition inexhaustible,
can be exhausted
; and
it must be exhausted if motion
is to
be possible.
It
is not an answer to say that the two series
are exhausted simultaneously.
The
usual mode
of
refutation
given by mathematicians
from Descartes to Tannery, correct in a sense, has an analogous
defect.
To show that the sum of the infinite series
1 + -I + ^ +
.
.
.
is equal to 2, or to calculate (in the Achilles) the exact moment
when
Achilles
will
overtake the
tortoise,
is
to answer
the
question when ? whereas the question actually asked
is how 1
On the hypothesis of divisibility ad infinitum you will, in the
Dichotomy,
never reach
the
limit,
and,
in
the
Achilles, the
distance separating Achilles from the tortoise, though
it con-
tinually decreases, will never vanish.
And
if you introduce
the limit, or, with a numerical calculation, the discontinuous,
Zeno
is quite aware that his arguments are no longer valid.
We are then in presence of another hypothesis as to the com-
position of the continuum
; and this hypothesis
is dealt with
in the third and fourth arguments.^
It appears then that the first and second arguments, in their
full significance, were not really met before G. Cantor formu-
lated his new theory of continuity and infinity.
On
this
I
can
only
refer
to Chapters
xlii and
xliii
of Mr.
Bertrand
Russell's Princi'ples of Mathematics, vol.
i.
Zeno's argument
in the Dichotomy is that, whatever motion we assume to have
taken
place,
this presupposes another motion
;

another, and so on ad infinitum.
Hence there is an endless
regress
in
the
mere
idea
of
any assigned
motion.
Zeno's
argument has then
to be met by proving that the
'infinite
regress
' in this ease is
' harmless
'.
As regards the Achilles, Mr. G. H. Hardy remarks that
' the
kernel of
it
lies in the perfectly valid proof vs^hich it
affords
that the tortoise passes through as many points as Achilles,
a view which embodies an accepted doctrine of modern mathe-
matics '.^
The. argument in the Arroiv i_s.based on the assumptionjthat
timels^ade up, of indivisihle elements or instants.
Aristotle
meets
it by denyijng^thg assumption.
' For time is not made
up
of indivisible instants
{no%vs), any more than any other
magnitude is made up of indivisible elements.'
' (Zeno's result)
follows through assuming that time is made up of (indivisible)
instants
[notvs)
;
if
this
is not admitted,
his conclusion does
not
follow.'^
On the other hand, the modern view
is that
Zeno's contention
is true: 'If
(said Zeno) 'everything
is at
rest or in motion when
it occupies a space equal to itself, and
if what moves
is always
in the
instant,
it follows that the
moving arrow
is unmoved.'
Mr. Russell ^ holds that this is
' a very plain statement of an elementary fact
'
;
' it
is a very important and very widely applicable platitude,
namely
" Every
possible value of a variable
is a constant ".
If
a; be
a
variable which can take
all values from
to
1,
all the values it can take are
definite numbers such as
-| or
-|
,
which
are
all
absolute
constants
.
.
. Though
a
variable
is
always connected with
some
class;
it
is
not
the
class, nor
a particular member of the class, nor yet the whole class, but
any member of the
class.'
The usual x in algebra
' denotes
the
disjunction
formed by
the
various
memlaers'
.
.
. 'The
values of x are then the terms of the disjunction
; and each
of
these
is
a
constant.
This
simple
logical
fact seems
to
constitute
the
essence
of
Zeno's
contention
that
the
arrow
is always at rest.'
' But Zeno's argument contains an element
which
is
specially
applicable
to
continua.
In the
case
of
motion it denies that there is such a thing as a state of motion.
In the general case of a continuous variable, it may be taken
as denying actual
infinitesimals.

attempt to extend to the values of a variable the variability
which belongs
to
it
alone.
When once
it
is firmly realized
that all the values of a variable are constants, it becomes easy
to see, by taking any two such values, that their difference
is
always finite, and hence that there are no infinitesimal differ-
ences.
If X be a variable which may take
all
real
values
from
to
1
, then, taking any two of these values, we see that
their difference
is
finite, although
a;
is a continuous variable.
It is true the difference might have been less than the one we
chose
; but if it had been, it would still have been finite.
The
lower
limit
to
possible
differences
is
zero, but
all
possible
differences
are
finite
;
and
in
this
there
is no shadow
of
contradiction.
This static theory of the variable is due to the
mathematicians, and
its absence in
Zeno's
day
led
him
to
suppose that continuous change was impossible without a state
of change, which involves infinitesimals and the contradiction
of a body's being where it is not.'
In
his
later
chapter on Motion
Mr.
Russell concludes
as
follows
: ^
' It
is
to be
observed
that,
in consequence
of
the
denial
of the infinitesimal and in consequence
of the
allied purely
technical
view
of
the
derivative
of
a
function, we
must
entirely reject the notion of a state of -motion.
Motion consists
merely in the occupation of different places at different times,
subject
to
continuity as explained in
Part V.
There
is no
transition from
place
to
place, no
consecutive moment
or
consecutive position, no such thing as velocity except in the
sense
of a real number which
is the
limit of
a
certain
set
of
quotients.
The
rejection
of
velocity and
acceleration as
physical facts
(i. e. as properties belonging at each instant to
a moving point, and not merely real numbers expressing limits
of
certain
ratios)
involves, as we
shall
see, some
difficulties
in
the
statement
of
the laws
of motion;
but
the reform
introduced by
Weierstrass in
the
infinitesimal
calculus
has
rendered this rejection imperative.'
We come
lastly
to
the
fourth argument
(the Stadium).
Aristotle's representation of
it
is obscure through its extreme
brevity of expression, and the matter is further perplexed by
an uncertainty of reading.
But the meaning intended to be
conveyed

clear.

instant, the absolute indivisible element of time
;
this is Zeno's
hypothesis.
But,
in order
that
B^,
C\ may have taken up
their new positions, there must have been a moment at which
they crossed
or B^ was
vertically over
(7j.
Yet the motion
has,
by
hypothesis, taken
place
in
an
indivisible
instant.
Therefore, either they have not crossed
(in which case there
is no movement), or in the particular indivisible instant two
positions have been occupied by the two moving objects, that
is
to
say, the instant
is no longer
indivisible.
And,
if the
instant is divided into two equal parts, this, on the hypothesis
of indivisibles, is equivalent to saying that an instant is double
of itself.
Two remarks may be added.
Though the
first two argu-
ments are directed against those who assert the divisibility ad
infinitum
of
magnitudes
and
times,
there
is no
sufficient
justification for Tannery's contention that they were specially
dii'ected against a view, assumed by him to be Pythagorean,
that bodies, surfaces and lines are made up of mathematical
points.
There
is indeed no evidence that the Pythagoreans
held this view at all
;
it does not follow from their definition
of a point as a 'unit having position' (fioyas deatv 'iypvaa)
;
and,
as we have
seen, Aristotle says that the Pythagoreans
maintained that units and numbers have magnitude.^
It would appear
that, after more than
2,300
years, con-
troversy on Zeno's arguments is yet by no means at an end.
But the subject cannot here be pursued further.^

IX
PLATO
It
is
in
tiie Seventh Book
oÂ£ the MejnMic that we
find
the most general statement of the attitude of Plato towards
mathematics.
Plato regarded mathematics in its four branches,
arithmetic, geometrj-, stereometry and astronomy, as the
first
essential
in the
training
of
philosophers and
of those who
should rule his ideal State
;
' let no one destitute of geometry
enter my
doors',
said the
inscription
over
the door
of
his
school.
There
could be no
better
evidence
of
the supreme
importance which he attached to the mathematical sciences.
What Plato emphasizes throughout when speaking of mathe-
matics is
its value for the training of the mind
;
its practical
utility is of no account in comparison.
Thus arithmetic must
be pursued
for the sake of knowledge, not for any practical
ends such as
its use in trade ^
; the real science of arithmetic
has
nothing
to
do
with
actions,
its
object
is
knowledge.^
A very
little geometry and arithmetical
calculation
suffices
for the commander of an army;
it
is the higher and more
advanced portions which tend
to
lift the mind on high and
to
enable
it
ultimately
to
see
the
final aim
of
philosophy,
the idea of the Good ^
; the value of the two sciences consists
in the fact that they draw the soul towards truth and create
the philosophic attitude
of mind,
lifting on high the things
which our ordinary habit would keep down.*
The extent to which Plato insisted on the purely theoretical
character of
the mathematical
sciences
is
illustrated by
his
peculiar views
about
the two
subjects which
the
ordinary
person would regard as having, at least, an important practical
side, namely astronomy and music.
According to
Plato, true
astronomy is not concerned with the movements of the visible

Politicus 258 d.
' Hep. 526 D, E.
<
II. 527 b.

PLATO
285
heavenly bodies.
The arrangement of the stars in the heaven
and
their
apparent
movements
are
indeed
wonderful and
beautiful, but the observation of and the accounting for them
falls
far short
of true astronomy.
Before we can attain to
this we must get beyond mere observational astronomy,
' we
must leave the heavens alone
'.
The true science of astronomy
is in
fact a kind
of ideal kinematics, dealing with the laws
of motion of true stars in a sort of mathematical heaven
of
which the visible heaven
is an imperfect expression in time
and
space.
The
visible heavenly bodies and
their apparent
motions we are to regard merely as
illustrations, comparable
to the diagrams which the geometer draws to
illustrate the
true straight lines, circles, &c., about which his science reasons
;
they are
to be used
as
' problems
'
only, with the object of
ultimately
getting
rid
of
the
apparent
irregularities
and
arriving
at
' the
true
motions with
which
essential
speed
and essential slowness move in relation to one another in the
true numbers and the true forms, and carry their contents
with them
'
(to
use
Burnet's
translation
of
to.
kvovTo)}
'Numbers' in
this passage correspond to the periods of the
apparent motions
; the
' true forms
' are the true orbits con-
trasted with the apparent.
It
is right to add that according
to
one view
(that
of
Burnet)
Plato
means,
not
that
true
astronomy
deals with an
'ideal heaven'
different from the
apparent, but that it deals with the true motions of the visible
bodies as distinct from their apparent motions.
This would
no doubt agree with Plato's attitude in the Lmvs, and at the
time when
he
set
to
his
pupils
as
a problem
for
solution
the question by what combinations of uniform circular revolu-
tions the apparent movements of the heavenly bodies can be
accounted for.
But, except on the assumption that an ideal
heaven
is meant,
it
is
difficult
to
see what Plato can mean
by the contrast which he draws between the visible broideries
of heaven
(the
visible
stars and
their arrangement), which
are
indeed
beautiful,
and
the
true
broideries which
they
only
imitate
and
which
are
infinitely more
beautiful
and
marvellous.
This was not a view
of astronomy that would appeal to
the
ordinary
person.
Plato
himself
admits
the
difficulty.
' Rep.

PLATO
When Socrates's interlocutor speaks of the use of astronomy
for
distinguishing months and
seasons,
for
agriculture and
navigation, and even
for military purposes, Socrates
rallies
him on
his
anxiety
that
his curriculum
should not
consist
of subjects which the mass of people would regard as useless
:
' it is by no means an easy thing, nay it is difficult, to believe
that in studying these subjects a certain organ in the mind
of every one is purified and rekindled which
is destroyed and
blinded by
other
pursuits, an organ which
is more worthy
of
preservation than ten thousand
eyes
;
for by
it alone
is
truth
discerned.' ^
As with asti'onomy, so with harmonics.^
The true science of
harmonics differs from that science as commonly understood.
Even
the
Pythagoreans, who
discovered the correspondence
of
certain
intervals
to
certain numerical
ratios,
still made
their theory take too much account of audible sounds.
The
true
science
of harmonics should be
altogether independent
of observation and experiment.
Plato agreed with the Pytha-
goreans as to the nature of sound.
Sound is due to concussion of
air, and when there is rapid motion in the air the tone is high-
pitched, when the motion
is slow the tone
is low
; when the
speeds are in certain arithmetical proportions, consonances or
harmonies result.
But audible movements produced, say, by
different lengths
of strings are only useful
as
illustrations;
they
are
imperfect
representations
of
those
mathematical
movements
which
produce
mathematical
consonances,
and
it
is these true consonances which the true apiiovLKOi should
study.
We get on to easier ground when Plato discusses geometry.
The importance of geometry lies, not in its practical use, but
in the fact that it is a study of objects eternal and unchange-
able, and tends to
lift the soul towards
truth.
The essence
of geometry is therefore directly opposed even to the language
which, for want of better terras, geometers are obliged to use
;
thus
they
speak
of
' squaring ',
' applying
(a
rectangle)
',
' adding \ &c., as
if the object were to do something, whereas
the
true purpose
of geometry
is knowledge.^
Geometry
is
concerned, not with material things, but with mathematical
â€¢ Sep- 527 D, E.

ih. 531 a-c.
'

vii. 526 D-527 b.

PLATO
287
points, lines, triangles, squares, &c., as objects of pure thought.
If we use a diagram in geometry, it is only as an illustration
;
the
triangle which we draw
is
an imperfect representation
of the real triangle of which we think.
Constructions, then,
or the processes of squaring, adding, and so on, are not of the
essence of geometry, but are actually antagonistic to it.
With
these views before
us, we can without
hesitation accept
as
well founded the story of Plutarch that Plato blamed Eudoxus,
Archytas and Menaechmus
for trying
to reduce
the
dupli-
cation
of the cube
to
mechanical constructions by means of
instruments, on
the ground
that
'the good of geometry
is
thereby
lost and destroyed, as
it
is brought back to things
of
sense instead
of being
directed upward and grasping at
eternal and incorporeal images
'. ^
It follows almost inevitably
that we must reject the tradition attributing to Plato himself
the
elegant mechanical
solution
of
the problem
of the two
mean proportionals which we have given in the chapter on
Special Problems (pp. 256-7).
Indeed, as we said, it is certain
on other grounds that the so-called Platonic solution was later
than
that
of
Eratosthenes;
otherwise
Eratosthenes would
hardly
have
failed
to
mention
it
in
his
epigram,
along
with the solutions by Archytas and Menaechmus.
Tannery,
indeed, regards
Plutarch's
story
as
an
invention
based
on
nothing more than the general character of Plato's philosophy,
since
it took no account of the
real nature
of the solutions
of Archytas and Menaechmus;
these
solutions
are
in
fact
purely theoretical and would have been difficult or impossible
to carry out in practice, and there
is no reason to doubt that
the solution by Eudoxus was of a simikr kind.^
This is true,
but
it
is evident that
it was the practical difficulty quite as
much as the
theoretical elegance
of the constructions which
impressed the Greeks.
Thus the author of the letter, wrongly
attributed
to
Eratosthenes, which
gives
the
history of
the
problem,
says
that
the
earlier
solvei's
had
all
solved
the
problem
in a
theoretical manner but had
not been
able
to
reduce their
solutions to
practice, except to a certain small
extent Menaechmus, and that with difficulty
; and the epigram
of Eratosthenes himself says,
' do not attempt the impracticable

PLATO
business of the
cylinders of Archyfcas or the cutting of the
cone in the three curves of Menaechmus '.
It would therefore
be quite possible for Plato to regai'd Archytas and Menaechmus
as having given constructions that were ultra-mechanical, since
they were more mechanical than the ordinary constructions by
means of the straight line and circle; and even the latter, which
alone are required for the processes of
' squaring
',
' applying
(a rectangle)
' and
' adding
', are according to Plato no part of
theoretic geometry.
This banning even of simple constructions
from true geometry seems, incidentally, to make it impossible
to accept the conjecture of Hankel that we owe to Plato the
limitation, so important in
its effect on the later development
of geometry, of the instruments allowable in constructions to
the
ruler and compasses.^
Indeed, there are
signs that the
limitation began
before
Plato's time
(e. g.
this may be the
explanation of the two constructions attributed to Oenopides),
although no doubt
Plato's, influence would help to keep the
restriction
in
force;
for
other
instruments, and
the use
of
curves
of
higher
order than
circles
in
constructions, were
expressly barred in any case where the ruler and compasses
could be made to serve (cf. Pappus's animadversion on a solu-
tion of a
' plane
' problem by means of conies in Apollonius's
Conies, Book V).
Contributions
to the philosophy
of mathematics.
We find in Plato's dialogues what appears to be the
first
serious attempt at a philosophy of mathematics.
Aristotle
says that between sensible objects and the ideas Plato placed
'things mathematical'
(to.
fiadr]fj.aTLKd}, wliich differed from
sensibles
in
being
eternal and unmoved, but
differed again
from
tiie
ideas
in
that
there can
be many
mathematical
objects of the same kind, while the idea is one only
;
e. g. the
idea
of
triangle
is
one, but
there may be any number
of
mathematical
triangles
as
of
visible
triangles, namely
the
perfect
triangles
of
which
the
visible
triangles
are imper-
fect
copies.
A passage
in one of the Letters (No.
7,
to
the'
friends of Dion)
is interesting in this connexion.^
Speaking
of a circle by way of example, Plato says there is
(1) some-

thing
called a
circle and known by that name
; next there
is
(2)
its definition as that
in which the
distances from
its
extremities in
all
directions to the centre are always equal,
for this may be said to be the definition of that to which the
names
' round
' and
' circle
' are applied
;
again
(3) we have
the circle which
is drawn or turned
:
this circle is perishable
and perishes; not
so, however, with
(4)
avTov
6
kvkXos, the
essential
circle,
or
the
idea
of
circle
:
it
is by
reference
to
this that the other circles exist, and
it
is different from each
of thein.
The same distinction applies
to anything else, e. g.
the
straight,
colour, the good, the
beautiful, or any natural
or
artificial
object,
fire, water,
&c.
Dealing separately with
the four things above distinguished, Plato observes that there
is nothing essential in (1) the name
:
it is merely conventional
;
there is nothing to prevent our assigning the name
' straight
to what we now call
' round
' and vice versa
; nor is there any
real
definiteness about
(2)
the
definition, seeing that
it too
is made up of parts of speech, nouns and verbs.
The circle
(3), the
particular
circle drawn or turned,
is not free from
admixture of other things
:
it is even full of what is opposite
to
the true
nature
of a
circle,
for
it
will anywhere touch
a straight line', the meaning of which is presumably that we
cannot in practice draw a circle and a tangent with only one
point common (although a mathematical
circle and a mathe-
matical straight line touching it meet in one point only).
It
will be observed that in the above classification there
is no
place given to the many particular mathematical circles which
correspond
to those which we
draw, and
are
intermediate
between these imperfect circles and the idea of
circle which
is one only.
(a)
The hypotheses of mathematics.
The hypotheses
of mathematics are discussed by
Plato
in
the Re]mblic.
' I think you know that those who occupy themselves with
geometries and calculations and the like take for granted the
odd and the even,
figures, three kinds of
angles, and other
things cognate to these in each subject
; assuming these things
as known, they take them as hypotheses and thenceforward
they do
not
feel called upon to give any explanation with

290
.
fijAiyj
regard to them either to themselves or any one else, but treat
them as manifest to every one
; basing themselves on these
hypotheses, they proceed at once
to go through the
rest of
the argument
till
they
arrive, with general
assent,
at
the
particular
conclusion
to
which
their
inquiry was
directed.
Further you know that they make use of visible figures and
argue about them, but in doing so they are not thinking of
these
figures but
of
the things
wliich they represent;
thus
it
is the absolute square and the absolute diameter which
is
the
object
of their argument, not the diameter which they
draw
;
and
similarly, in other
cases, the things which they
actually model or draw, and which may also have their images
in
shadows
or
in
water,
are
themselves
in
turn used
as
images,
the
object
of
the
inquirer being
to
see their abso-
lute
counterparts which cannot
be seen
otherwise than by
thought.'
(j8)
The huo
intellectual onethods.
Plato distinguishes two processes
: both begin from hypo-
theses.
The one method cannot get above these hypotheses,
but, treating them as if they were first principles, builds upon
them and, with the
aid
of diagrams
or
images,
arrives
at
conclusions
:
this is the method of geometry and mathematics
in general.
The other method treats the hypotheses as being
really hypotheses and nothing more, but uses them as stepping-
stones
for mounting higher and
higher
until
the
principle
of
all
things
is
reached,
a
principle about which
there
is
nothing hypothetical
; when this
is reached,
it
is possible
to
descend
again, by
steps each connected
with the preceding
step, to the conclusion, a process which has no need of any
sensible images but deals in ideals only and ends in them ^
;
this method, which rises above and puts an end to hypotheses,
and reaches the
first principle in
this way, is the dialectical
method.
For want of
this, geometry and the other sciences
which in some
sort lay hold of truth are comparable to one
dreaming about
truth, nor can they have a waking siglit of
it
so
long
as
they
treat
their
hypotheses
as
immovable
truths, and
are unable
to
give any account or explanation
of them.^

THE TWO INTELLECTUAL METHODS
291
With the above
quotations we
should
read a
passage
of
Proclus.
' Nevertheless certain methods have been handed down.
The
finest
is
the method which
by means
of
analysis
carries
the thing sought up to an acknowledged principle
; a method
which Plato, as they say, communicated to Leodamas, and by
which the
latter too
is said to have discovered many things
in geometry.
The second
is the method of division, which
divides
into
its
parts the genus proposed
for
consideration,
and gives a starting-point for the demonstration by means of
the
elimination
of
the
other elements
in
the
construction
of what
is proposed, which method
also
Plato
extolled
as
being of assistance to all sciences.' ^
The first part of this passage, with a like dictum in Diogenes
Laertius
that
Plato
' explained
to Leodamas
of Thasos the
method of inquiry by analysis ',^
lias commonly been under-
stood
as attributing
to
Plato
the invention
of the method
of mathematical
analysis.
But,
analysis being according to
the
ancient view nothing more than
a
series
of successive
reductions of a theorem or problem
till
it
is finally reduced
to
a theorem
or problem
already known,
it
is
difiicult
to
see in what Plato's supposed discovery could have consisted
;
for
analysis
in
this
sense must have
been frequently
used
in earlier investigations.
Not only did Hippocrates of Chios
reduce the problem of duplicating the cube to that of finding
two mean
proportionals, but
it
is clear that the method of
analysis in the sense of reduction must have been in use by
the
Pythagoreans.
On
the
other
hand,
Proclus's
language
suggests
that what he had
in mind was
the
philosophical
method
described
in
the
passage of the Republic, which
of
course does not refer to mathematical analysis at all
;
it may
therefore
well
be
that
the
idea
that
Plato
discovered
the
method of analysis is due to a misapprehension.
But analysis
and
synthesis following
each other are
related
in
the same
way as the upward and downward progressions in the dialec-
tician's intellectual method.
It has been suggested, therefore,
that
Plato's
achievement was
to
observe
the
importance
from the
point of view
of
logical
rigour,
of the
confirma-
tory synthesis following
analysis.

PLATO
mentioned by Proclus
is the method of successive bipartitions
of genera
into
species such
as we
find
in
the Sophist and
the
Politicus, and
has
little
to say
to geometry;
but
the
mention of
it side by side with analysis
itself suggests that
Proclus confused
the
latter
with
the
philosophical
method
referred
to.
(y)
Definitions.
Among the fundamentals of mathematics Plato paid a good
deal of attention to definitions.
In some cases his definitions
connect themselves with Pythagorean tradition
; in others he
seems to have struck out a new line for himself.
The division
of numbers into odd and even
is one of the most common of
his
illustrations;
number,
he
says,
is
divided
equally,
i.e.
there are as many odd numbers as even, and this is the true
division of number;
to divide number (e.g.) into myriads and
what
are not myriads
is
not a proper division.^
An even
number is defined as a number divisible into two equal parts ^;
in another place
it
is explained as that which
is not scalene
but
isosceles ^
:
a curious and apparently unique application
of these terms to number, and in any case a defective
state-
ment unless the term
' scalene
' is restricted to the case in which
one part of the number
is odd and the other even
;
for
of
course an even number can be divided into two unequal odd
numbers or two unequal even numbers (except
2 in the
first
case and
2 and 4
in
the
second).
The
further
distinction
between even-times-even, odd-times-even, even-times-odd and
odd-times-odd occurs
in Plato *
:
but, as thrice two
is called
odd^times-even and twice three is even-times-odd, the number
in
both
cases being the
same,
it
is
clear that,
like Euclid,
Plato regarded
even-times-odd and
odd-times-even
as
con-
vertible terms, and did not restrict their meaning in the way
that Nicomachus and the neo-Pythagoreans did.
Coming
to geometry we
find an
interesting view
of the
term
' figure
'.
What
is
it, asks Socrates, that
is true of the
round, the straight, and the other things that you call figures,
and
is
the same
for
all?
As a suggestion
for a
definition
of
' figure
', Socrates says,
' let us regard as figure that which
alone
of
existing things
is
associated
with
colour'.

DEFINITIONS
293
aaks what
is to be done if the interlocutor says he docs not
know what colour
is;
what alternative
definition
is there?
Socrates
replies
that
it
will
be admitted that in geometry-
there are such things as what we
call a surface or a
solid,
and so on
; from these examples we may learn what we mean
by
figure; figure
is that
in which a
solid ends, or figure
is
the
limit
(or
extremity,
Tre'pay)
of
a
solid.'
Apart
from
' figure
'
as form
or
shape,
e. g.
the round
or
straight,
this
passage makes
' figure
' practically equivalent to surface, and
we are reminded of the Pythagorean term for surface, xpo'".
colour or
skin, which Aristotle
similarly explains as
xpSijia,
colour,
something
inseparable
from
nepa?,
extremity."
In
Euclid
of
course
opos, limit or boundary,
is
defined
as the
extremity (rrepas)
of a
thing, while
' figure
'
is that which is
contained by one or more boundaries.
There
is reason to believe, though we are not
specifically
told, that
the
definition
of
a
line
as
' breadthless
length
originated
in
the
Platonic
School, and
Plato himself
gives
a definition of a straight
line
as
' that of which the middle
covers
the
ends
' ^
(i. e.
to an
eye placed at either end and
looking along the straight line)
;
this seems to me to be the
origin
of the Euclidean
definition
' a
line which
lies evenly
with the points on it
', which, I think, can only be an attempt
to express the sense
of
Plato's
definition
in terms to which
a geometer could not take exception as travelling outside the
subject-matter of geometry,
i. e. in terms excluding any appeal
to vision.
A point had been defined by the Pythagoreans as
a 'monad having position'
;
Plato apparently objected to this
definition and substituted no other
;
for, according to Aristotle,
he
regarded
the
genus
of
points
as
being a
'geometrical
fiction
', calling a point the beginning of a line, and often using
the term
' indivisible
lines
'
in
the
same
sense.*
Aristotle
points out that even indivisible
lines must have extremities,
and therefore they do not help, while the
definition of a point
as
' the extremity of a line
' is unscientific.Â°

The
'sphere'
is
similarly
defined
as
'that which
has
the
distances from its centre to
its terminations or ends in every
direction equal
', or simply as that which is
' equal (equidistant)
from the centre in all directions '?
The Parmenides contains certain phrases corresponding to
what we
find
in
Euclid's
preliminary
matter.
Thus
Plato
speaks of something which
is
' a part
' but not
' parts
' of the
One,'* reminding us of Euclid's distinction between a fraction
which is
' a part ',
i. e. an aliquot part or submultiple, and one
which
is
'parts',
i.e. some number more than one
of such
parts,
e. g. |.
If equals be added to unequals, the sums ditFer
by the same amount as the original unequals did
: * an axiom
in a rather more complete form than that subsequently inter-
polated in Euclid.
Summary of the mathematics
in
Plato.
The actual arithmetical and geometrical propositions referred
to or presupposed in Plato's writings are not such as to suggest
that
he was
in advance
of
his
time
in mathematics
;
his
knowledge
does
not appear to have been more than up
to
date.
In the following paragraphs
I have attempted to give
a summary, as complete as possible, of the mathematics con-
tained in the dialogues.
A
proposition in proportion is quoted in the Parmenides,^
namely that, if a > b, then
[a + c)
: {b + c) <
a
: b.
In the Laws a certain number, 5,040, is selected as a most
convenient number of citizens to form a state
;
its advantages
are that
it
is the product
of
12,
21 and
20, that a twelfth
part of it is again divisible by
12, and that it has as many as
59 different divisors in
all, including all the natural numbers
from
1
to
12 with
the
exception of
11, while
it
is nearly
divisible by 11 (5038 being a multiple of 11).^

Regidar and semi-regular
solids.
The
' so-called
Platonic
figures
', by which are meant the
five regular solids, are of course not Plato's discovery, for they
had been partly investigated by the Pythagoreans, and very

fully by Theaetetus
; they were evidently only called Platonic
because
oi; the use made of them in the Timaeus, where the
particles of the four elements are given the shapes of the
first
four of the
solids, the pyramid or tetrahedron being appro-
priated to fire, the octahedron to air, the icosahedron to water,
and the cube to earth, while the Creator used the
fifth
solid,
the dodecahedron, for the universe itself.^
According to Heron, however, Archimedes, who discovered
thirteen semi-regular solids inscribable in a sphere, said that
' Plato also knew one of them, the figure with fourteen faces,
of which there are two
sorts, one made up of eight triangles
and six squares, of earth and
air, and already known to some
of the ancients, the other again made up of eight square's and
six triangles, which seems to be more difliicult.' ^
The
fiLrst of these
is easily obtained
;
if we take each square
face
of a cube and make
in
it a smaller square by joining
the middle points of each pair of consecutive sides, we get six
squares (one in each face)
; taking the three out of the twenty-
four sides of these squares which are about any one angular
point of the cube, we have an equilateral triangle
; there are
eight of these equilateral triangles, and if we cut aS from the
corners of the cube the pyramids on these triangles as bases,
we have a semi-regular polyhedron
inscribable in a sphere and having
as
faces
eight
equilateral
triangles
and six squares.
The description of
the second semi-regular figure with
fourteen
faces
is wrong:
there are
only two more such
figures,
(1)
the
figure obtained by cutting
off" from
the
corners
of
the
cube
smaller
pyramids on
equilateral
triangular bases such
that
regular
octagons, and not
squares,
are
left
in the
six square
faces,
the
figure,
that
is,
contained
by
eight
triangles
and
six
octagons, and
(2) the figure obtained by cutting
ofi' from the
corners of an octahedron equal pyramids with square bases
such as
. to
leave eight
regular hexagons
in
the eight
faces,
that is, the figure contained by six squares and eight hexagons.

PLATO
(/3)
The construction of the regular
solids.
Plato,
of
course,
constructs
the
regular
solids by simply
putting together the plane faces.
These faces are, he observes,
made up of triangles
; and all triangles are decomposable into
two right-angled triangles.
Right-angled triangles are either
(1)
isosceles or (2) not
isosceles, having the two acute angles
unequal.
Of the latter class, which
is unlimited in number,
one triangle is the most beautiful, that in wliich the square on
the perpendicular is triple of the. square on the base
(i. e. the
triangle which
is the half of an equilateral triangle obtained
by drawing
a perpendicular from a vertex on the opposite
side).
(Plato
is
here
Pythagorizing.^)
One
of
the
regular
solids, the
cube, has
its faces
(squares) made up of the
first
kind of right-angled triangle, the isosceles, four of
them being put together to form the square
; three
' others with equilateral triangles for faces, the tetra-
hedron, octahedron and icosahedron, depend upon
the
other
species
of
right-angled
triangle
only,
each face being made up of six (not two) of those right-angled
triangles, as shown in the figure
; the fifth
solid, the dodeca-
hedron,
with
twelve
regnlar
pentagons
for
faces,
is merely
alluded
to, not described, in
the passage before
us, and Plato is aware that
its faces cannot be constructed out of the two
elementary right-angled triangles on which the
four other solids depend.
That an attempt was made to divide
the pentagon into a number
of triangular elements
is
clear
from three passages, two in Plutarch ^
and one
in
Alcinous."
Plutarch says
that
each
of
the
twelve
faces
of
a
dodecahedron
is
made up
of
thirty
elementary scalene triangles which are
difierent from the elementary triangle
of
the
solids
witli
triangular
faces.
Alcinous
speaks
of the
360 elements
which are produced when. each
pen-
tagon 18 divided into
five isosceles triangles and each of the

latter into six scalene triangles.
If we draw
lines in a pen-
tagon as shown in the accompanying
figure, we obtain such
a set of triangles in a way which also shows the Pythagorean
pentagram (cf. p. 161, above).
(y)
Geometric 'means between two square
iiwrnhers
or two
cubes.
In the Timaeus Plato, speaking of numbers
' whether solid
or square
' with a (geometric) mean or means between them,
observes that between planes one mean sutEces, but to connect
two solids two means are necessary.'
By planes and
solids
Plato probably meant square and cube members respectively,
so that the theorems quotedare probably those of Eucl. VIII.
11, 12, to the eflfect that between two square numbers there is
one mean proportional number, and between two cube numbers
two mean
proportional numbers.
Nicomachus
quotes
these
very propositions as constituting
' a certain Platonic theorem '.^
Here, too, it may be that the theorem
is called
' Platonic
' for
the
sole reason that
it
is quoted by Plato in the Timaeus;
it may well be older, for the idea of two mean proportionals
between two straight
lines had already appeared in Hippo-
crates's reduction of the problem of doubling' the cube.
Plato's
allusion does not appear to be to the duplication of the cube
in this passage any more than in the expression kv^cov
av^rj,
' cubic increase
', in the Repihblic? which appears to be nothing
but the addition of the third dimension to a square, making
a cube
(cf.
Tpirr]
av^-r},
'third
increase',* meaning
a
cube
number
as compared with
SvvajiL^, a square number, terms
which
are
applied, e.g.
to the numbers
729 and
81
respec-
tively).

The two geometrical passages in
the Meno.
We come now to the two geometrical passages in the Meno.

is trying to show that teaching is only
reawaking in the mind of the learner the memory of some-
thing.

illustrates by

PLATO

F
' yes
' or
' no
' for an answer, but leadini;- up to the geometrical
construction of '/2.
Starting with a straight line AB 2 feet
long, Socrates describes a square ABGD upon
it and
easily
shows that the
area
is
4 square
feet.
Producing the
sides
AB, AD to
G, K so that BG, DK are equal to AB, AD, and
completing the figure, we have a square of side 4 feet, and this
square is equal to four times the original square and therefore
has an area of 16 square
feet.
N(jw, says Socrates, a square
8
feet in area must have
its
side
greater than 2 and less than 4 feet.
The slave suggests that it
is 3 feet
in
length.
By
taking N
the
middle point
of DK
(so that AN
is 3 feet) and completing the square
on AN, Socrates easily shows that
the square on AN is not
8 but
9
square
feet
in
area.
If L, M
be
the middle points of GH, HK and
GL, CM
be joined, we have
four
squares in the figure, one of which is ABGD, while each of the
others is equal to it.
If now.we draw the diagonals BL, LM,
MD, DB of the four squares, each diagonal bisects its square,
and the four make a square BLMD, the area of which
is half
that
of
the square AGHK, and
is therefore
8 square
feet;
BL
is
a
side
of
this
square.
Socrates
concludes with
the
words
'The
Sophists
call
this
straight
line
{BD)
the diameter
(diagonal);
this being
its name,
it
follows that
the square
which IS double (of the original square) has to be described on
the diameter.'
The other geometrical passage

difficult,!

it

it a

acceptance
;
nevertlieless, I think that
it
is not the right one,
but that the essentials of the correct interpretation were given
by
S. H. Butcher 1 (who, liowever, seems to have been com-
pletely anticipated by E.
F. August, the editor of Euclid, in
1829).
It
is necessary to begin with a literal translation
of
the
passage.
Socrates
is
explaining
a
procedure
' by
waj'
of hypothesis
', a procedure which, he observes,
is
illustrated
by the practice of geometers
' when they are asked, for example, as regards a given
area,
whether it is possible for this area to be inscribed in the form
of a triangle in a given
circle.
The answer might
be, " I do
not yet know whether this area
is such as can be so inscribed,
but I think I can suggest a hypothesis which will be useful for
the purpose
; I mean the following.
If the given area is such
as, when
one
has
applied
it
(as
a
rectangle)
to
the given
straight
line
in the
circle
{rrjv SoOeiaav avrov ypan/irjp, the
given
straight
line
in
it,
cannot, I
think, mean anything
but
the diameter
of the
circle*],
it
is
deficient by a
figure
(rectangle)
similar
to the very figure which
is applied, then
one
alternative seems
to me
to
result, while again another
results
if
it
is impossible for what I said to be done with
it.
Accordingly, by using a hypothesis, I am ready to tell you what
results with regard to the inscribing of the figure in the circle,
namely, whether the problem is possible or impossible."

Let AEB be a circle on ^jB as diameter, and
let At! be the
tangent
at
A.
Take E any point on

EDBF.
Then
it
is
clear that the rectangle GEDA
is
' applied
' to
the diameter AB, and also that.it
' falls short
' by a figure, the
rectangle EDBF, similar to the
' applied
' rectangle, for
AD:DE = ED:DB.
Also,

300
PLATO
described, is equal to the given area, that area is inscribed in
the form of a triangle in the given circle.^
In
order,
therefore,
to
inscribe
in
the
circle an
isosceles
triangle equal to the given area (X), we have to find a point E
on. the circle such that, if ED be drawn perpendicular to AB,
the rectangle AD
. DE is equal to the given area A'
(' applying
to AB a rectangle equal to X and falling short by a figure
similar
to
the
'applied'
figure
is
only another way of
ex-
pressing
it).
Evidently E lies on the rectangular hyperbola
' Butcher,
after giving the
essentials of
the
interpretation of
the
passage quite correctly, finds a difficulty.
'If, he says, 'the condition'
(as interpreted by him)
' holds good, the given ^^mpi'ov can be inscribed in
a circle.
But the converse proposition is not true.
The
x<"pio'' can
still
be inscribed, as required, even if the condition laid down is not fulfilled;
the true and necessary condition being that the given area is not greater
than that of the equilateral triangle,
i. e. the maximum triangle, which
can be inscribed in the given
circle.'
The
difiiculty arises in this way.
Assuming (quite fairly) that the given area is given in the form of a rect-
angle (for any given rectilineal figure can be transformed into a rectangle
of equal area). Butcher seems to suppose that it is identically the given
rectangle that is applied to AB.
But this is not necessary.
The termi-
nology of mathematics was not quite fixed in Plato's time, and he allows
himself some latitude of expression, ao that we need not be surprised to
find him using the phrase
' to apply the area
(;^to(jio>/) to a given straight
line
' as short for
' to apply to a given straight line a rectangle equal (but not
similar) to the given area
'

' that it is not every
given (area) that can be applied (in the form of a rectangle) falling short
by a square
figure').
If we interpret the expression
in this way, the
converse is true
;
if we cannot apply, in the way described, a rectangle
equal to the given rectangle, it is because the given rectangle is greater
than the equilateral,
i. e. the maximum, triangle that can be inscribed in
the circle, and the problem
is therefore impossible of solution.
(It was
not till long after the above was written that my attention was drawn to
the article on the same subject in the Journal of Philology, xxviii, 1903,
pp. 222-40, by Professor Cook Wilson.
I am
gi-atified to find that my
interpretation of the passage agrees with his.)

TWO GEOMETRICAL PASSAGES IN THE MENO

the equation
of which referred to AB, AG as axes of
x, y is
xy =
h"^,
where
6^
is
equal
to
the given
area.
For
a
real
solution
it
is necessary that V^ should be not greater than the
equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle,
i. e. not greater than
3 a/3
. a2/4, where a is the radius of the circle.
If 6^ is equal
to this area, there is only one solution
(the hyperbola in that
case touching the circle)
;
if
b'^ is less than this area, there are
two solutions corresponding to two points E, E' in which the
hyperbola cuts the circle.
\i AD â€” x, we have OB â€” x â€” a,
DE â€” V{2axâ€” x'^),
and
the
problem
is
the
equivalent
of
solving the equation
X V{2ax â€” x^) = V,
or
x'^{2ax â€” x'^) = Â¥.
This is an equation of the fourth degree which can be solved
by means
, of
conies, but
not by means of the
straight
line
and circle.
The solution
is given by the points
of intersec-
tion of the hyperbola xy = b- and the circle y^ = 2ax â€” x'^ or
x'^ + y^ = 2 ax.
In
this respect therefore the problem
is like
that of finding the two mean proportionals, which was likewise
solved, though not till later, by means of conies (Menaechmus).
I am tempted to believe
that we have
here an
allusion
to
another
actual problem,
requiring more
than
the
straight
Kne and circle for its solution,
which had exercised the minds
of geometers by the time
of
Plato, the problem, namely, of
inscribing in a circle a triangle
equal to a given area, a problem
which was
still
awaiting
a
solution, although
it had been
reduced
to
the
problem
of
applying
a
rectangle
satisfying
the
condition
described by
Plato, just as the duplication
of the cube had been reduced
to
the
problem
of
finding
two mean
proportionals.
Our
problem can, like the latter problem, easily be solved by the
' mechanical
' use of a ruler.
Suppose that the given rectangle
is placed so that the
side AB
lies along the diameter AB of
the circle.
Let E be the angle of the rectangle ABEC opposite
to A.
Place
a ruler
so
that
it passes through E and turn

302
PLATO
it about E until it passes through a point P of the circle such
that, if EP meets AB and AC produced in
T, R, PT shall be
equal to ER.
Then,
since RE=PT, AD= 3IT, where Jf is
the foot of the ordinate PM.
Therefore DT =^ AM, and
A3I
: AD = DT
: MT
= ED:PM,
whence
PM
. MA =ED.DA,
and APM is the half of the required (isosceles) triangle.
Benecke criticizes at length the similar interpretation of the
passage given by E. F. August.
So far, however, as his objec-
tions
relate
to
the
translation
of
particular
words
in
the
Greek text, they are, in my opinion, not well founded.^
For
the
rest, Benecke holds
that, in view of the
difficulty of the
problem which emerges, Plato
is unlikely to have introduced
it
in such an abrupt and casual way into the conversation
between
Socrates and Meno,
But the problem
is only one
of
the
same
nature
as
that
of
the
finding
of
two
mean
proportionals which was already a famous problem, and,
as
regards the form of the allusion, it is to be noted that Plato
was fond of dark hints in things mathematical.
If the above interpretation is too difficult (which I, for one,
do not admit), Benecke's
is certainly too easy.
He connects
his
interpretation
of the passage with
the
earlier
passage
about the square of side 2 feet
; according to him the problem
is, can an
isosceles right-angled
tri-
^- - - f
angle
equal
to
the
said
square
be
N.
;
inscribed
in
the given
circle?
This
V
is
of
course
only
possible
if
the
1
radius of the circle is 2 feet in length.

If AB, DE be two diameters
at right
/
angles, the inscribed triangle is ADE;
y^
the square ACDO formed by the radii
AO, OD and
the
tangents
at
Z>, A
is then the
'applied'
rectangle, and
the rectangle by which it falls short is also a square and equal

to Toioira

to the other square.
If this were the correct interpretation,
Plato
is using much too general language about the applied
rectangle
and
that by which
it
is
deficient;
it would
be
extraordinary that he should
express the
condition
in
this
elaborate way when he need only have said that the radius
of
the
circle must be equal
to
the
side of the
square and
therefore
2
feet
in
length.
The
explanation seems
to me
incredible.
The
criterion
sought
by
Socrates
is
evidently
intended
to
be
a
real
Sioptaixo^,
or
determination
of
the
conditions or limits of the possibility of a solution of the pro-
blem whether in
its original form or
in the form to which
it
is reduced;
but
it
is no
real
Sioptafjios
to say what
is
equivalent to saying that the problem
is possible of solution
if the circle is of a particular size, but impossible if the circle
is greater or less than that size.
The passage incidentally shows that the idea of a formal
SiopLo-fioi
defining
the
limits
of
possibility
of
solution was
familiar even before
Plato's time, and therefore that Proclus
must
be in
error when
he
says
that
Leon,
the
pupil
of
Neoclides,
' invented SLopio-fioi (determining) when the problem
which
is
the
subject of
investigation
is possible and when
impossible ',^ although Leon may have been the first to intro-
duce the term
or
to
recognize
formally
the
essential
part
played by SiopicrpLoi in geometry.
(e)
Plato and the doubling of the cube.
The
story of
Plato's
relation
to the problem of doubling
the cube has already been told (pp. 245-6, 255).
Although the
solution attributed to him
is not
his,
it may have been with
this problem in view that he complained that the study of
solid geometry had been unduly neglected up to his time.^
and he maintains that,
if Plato had meant
it in this sense, he should
have added that the
' defect ', although
' similar ', is not similarly situated.
I see no force in this argument in view of the want of fixity in mathe-
matical terminology in Plato's time, and of his own habit of varying his
phrases for literary effect.
Benecke makes the words mean
' of the same
kind \
e. g. a square with a square or a rectangle with a rectangle.
But
this would have no point unless the figures are squares, which begs the
whole question.

Solution of x^ + y^ = z^ in Mitegers.
We have already seen
(p.

is credited with
a rule (complementary to the similar rule attributed to Pytha-
goras) for finding a whole series of square numbers the sum
of which is also a square
; the formula is
(2 7i)2 + (%2-1)2 = (tc2+1)2.

Incommensurables.
On the subject of incommensurables or irrationals we have
first the passage of the Theaetetiis recordin
that Theodorus
proved
the
incommensurability
of
Vs,
\^5
... -J XT,
after
which
Theaetetus
generalized
the
theory
of
such
' roots
'.
This
passage
has
already been
fully
discussed
(pp.
203-9).
The subject of incommensurables comes up again in the Laws,
where Plato inveighs against the ignorance prevailing among
the Greeks of his time of the fact that lengths, breadths and
depths may be incommensurable as
well
as commensurable
with one another, and appears to imply that he himself had
not
learnt the
fact
till
late
(a/coucray
d\|/-e
Trore), so that he
was ashamed
for himself as well as for his countrymen in
general.^
But the irrationals known to Plato included more
than mere
' surds
' or the sides of non-squares
; in one place
he
says
that, just
as an even number may be
the sum
of
either two odd or two even numbers, the sum
of two
irra-
tionals may
be
either
rational
or
irrational.^
An
obvious
illustration of the former case is afibrded by a rational straight
line divided
'in extreme and mean ratio'.
Euclid (XIII.
6)
proves
that
each
of
the segments
is
a
particular kind
of
irrational straight line called by him in Book X an aiMtome
;
and to suppose that the irrationality of the two segments was
already known to Plato is natural enough if we are correct in
supposing that
' the theorems which
' (in the words of Proclus)
' Plato originated regarding iAe section
' ^ were theorems about
what came
to be
called
the
'golden
section',
namely
the
division of a straight
line
in extreme and mean ratio as in
Eucl. II. 11 and VI. 30.
The appearance of the latter problem
in Book II, the content of which is probably all Pythagorean,
suggests that
the incommensurability of the segments with

This is not the place to discuss at length the famous passage
about the Geometrical Number in the Rejmblic.^
Nor is its
mathematical
content
of
importance;
the
whole
thing
is
mystic
rather
than
mathematical,
and
is
expressed
in
rhapsodical language, veiling by fanciful
phraseology a few
simple mathematical
conceptions.
The numbers
mentioned
are supposed to be
two.
Hultsch and Adam
arrive
at
the
same two numbers, though by
different
routes.
The
first
of these numbers is 216, which according to Adam is the sum
of
three
cubes
3=+ 4^ + 53;
23, 3^
is
the
form
in
which
Hultsch obtains it.^

The number of interpretations of this passage
is legion.
For an exhaustive
discussion of the language as well as for
one of the best interpretations that has been put forward, see Dr. Adam's

ii, pp. 204-8, 264-312.

Svi/apfvT] should mean a side of a square.
Si/i^no-reuo/xeVi; represents a sort
of passive of dma/xevij, meaning that of which the hwafiivrj is

;
hence Adam takes it here to be the square of which the bwapivrj
is the
side, and the whole expression to mean the product of a square and
its
side,
i. e. simply the cube of the
side.
The cubes 3^ 4', 5' are supposed
to be meant because the words in the description of the second number
'of which the ratio in
its lowest .terms 4:3 when joined to
5' clearly
refer
to
the right-angled
triangle
3,
4,
5, and
because
at
least
three
authors, Plutarch {De Is. et Os. 373 F), Proclus (on lucl.
1, p. 428. 1) and
Aristides Quintilianus (De mus.,
p. 152 Meibom. = p. 90 Jahn)
say that
Plato used the Pythagorean or 'cosmic' triangle in
his
Number.
The
' three
distances
' are
regarded
as
' dimensions
',
and
the
' three
distances
and
four
limits
'
are held
to confirm
the interpretation
' cube
', because a solid
(parallelepiped) was said
to
have 'three dimensions and four limits' (Theol. Ar.,
p. 16 Ast, and Iambi, in Nicom.,
p. 93.
10), the limits
being bounding points as A, B, C, D in the accom-
"
panying
figure.

one way, but oblong, consisting on the one hand of 100 squares
of rational diameters
of

or,
if of

Another view of the whole passage has recently appeared (A. G. Laird,
Plata's Geometrical Number and the comment ofPfOclus, Madisou, Wiscon-
sin,
1918).
Like
all other
solutions,
it
is open
to
criticism
in some
details, but
it
is attractive in
so far as
it makes greater use of Proclus
(in Plntonis remp., vol.
ii, p. 36 seq. KroU) and especially of the passage
(p. 40) in which he illustrates the formation of the
' harmonies
' by means
of geometrical figures.
According to Mr. Laird there are not two separ-
ate numbers, and the description from which Hultsch and Adam derive
the number 216
is not a description of a number but a statement of a
general method of formation of
' harmonies
', which
is then applied to
the
triangle
3,
4, 5 as a particular
case,
in order to produce the one
Geometrical Number.
The basis of the whole thing is the use of figures
like that of Eucl. VI. 8 (a right-angled triangle divided by a perpendicular
from the right angle on the opposite side into two right-angled triangles
similar
to one another and to the
original
triangle).
Let ABC be a
right-angled triangle in which the sides CB, BA containing the
right
angle
are
rational
numbers
a,
h
respectively.
Draw AF at
right
angles
to AC meeting CB
produced in F.
Then the figure AFC is that of
Eucl.
VI.
8,
and
of
course AB^ = CB.BF.
Complete
the
rectangle ABFL,
and
produce
FL, CA
to meet
at K.
Then, by similar
tri-
angles, CB, BA, FB (= AL) and KL are
four
straight lines in continued proportion, and their
lengths are
a,
h,
V^ja, Vja^ respectively.
Mul-
tiplying throughout by a' in order to get rid of
fractions, we may
take
the
lengths
to be
a',
a^h, aV, Y
respectively.
Now, on Mr. Laird's
view, av^rjden Sm/d|ifrai are squares, as AB'^, and
av^^crcLt
dvvaa-revofjLfmi
rectangles, as FB, BC, to
it'hich the squares are
equal.
' Making like and

the terms a\ a\ ab\ V are four
te>-ms
(Spot) of a continued
proportion with three intervals (dTrotrrdafK), and
of course are
all
' con-
versable and

(Incidentally, out
of such
terms we can even obtain the number 216, for if we put n = 2, & =
3, we
have 8, 12, 18, 27 and the product of the extremes 8
. 27 = the product
of the means 12
18 = 216).
Applying the method to the triangle 3
4,
(as Proclus does) we have the terms 27, 36, 48, 64, and the

The ratio 4
: 3 must be taken in the sense of
' the numbers
4 and 3
', and Adam takes 'joined witli
5
' to mean that
4, 3
and 5 are multiplied together, making 60
; 60
' thrice increased
he interprets as
' 60 thrice multiplied by 60
', that
is to say,
60x60x60x60
or 3600^;
'so many times
100' must then
be the 'equal'
side of
this,
or
36 times
100;'
this 3600^ or
12960000, is one of the 'harmonies'.
The other is the same
number expressed as the product of two unequal factors, an
'oblong' number;
the
first
factor
is
100
times a number
which can be described either as
1
less than the square of the
' rational
diameter
of
5
',
or
as
2
less than
the square
of
the
' irrational diameter
' of
5, where the irrational diameter
of 5 is the diameter of a square of side
5,
i. e.
-/sO, and the
rational diameter is the nearest whole number to this, namely
7, so that the number which
is multiplied by 100 is 49 â€” 1, or
50 â€” 2,
i.e.
48, and
the
first
factor
is
therefore 4800;
the
second
factor
is
100
cubes
of
3,
or
2700;
and
of course
4800 X 2700 = 36002 or 12960000.
Hultsch obtains the side,
3600, of the first
' harmony
' in another way
; he takes 4 anS 3
joined to 5 to be the sum of 4, 3 and 5,
i. e.
1 2, and rph av^rjdei?,
' thrice increased
', to mean that the
1 2 is
' multiplied by three '^
making 36
;
'so many times 100
' is then 36 times 100, or 3600.
But the main interest of the passage from the
historical
' Adam maintains that rpls al^rjdeis cannot mean
' multiplied by 3
'.
He
observes
(p.
278,
note)
that
the
Greek
for
' multiplied
by
3
',
if we
use aii^avco, would be rpidSi ai^rjSds, this being the construction used by
Nicomachus

Never-
theless I think that rp'is ai^ridds would not be an unnatural expression for
a mathematician to use for
' multiplied by 3
', let alone Plato in a passage
like
this.
It
is to be noted that
jroXAarrXntridfoo and

of the multiplier;
yet

And ni^ava is
actually found with Toa-avraKts

see Pappus ii, p. 28.

TaKts av^Tjo-opev means
' we have to multiply by such a power
' of 10000 or
of 10 (although it is true that the chapter in which the expression occurs
may be a late addition to Pappus's original text).
On the whole, I prefer
Hultsch's interpretation to Adam's.
Tp\s nv^ridek can hardly mean that
60 is raised to the fouiih power, 60'
; and if
it did,
' so many times 100
',
immediately following the expression for 3600', would be pointless and
awkward.
On the other hand,
' so many times 100
' following the
ex-
pression for 36 would naturally indicate 3600.

A fair approximation
to ^2 was obtained
by selecting a square number such that, if 2 be multiplied by
it, the product is nearly a square
;
25
is such a square number,
since
25
times
2, or
50, only
differs by
1
from
7^;
conse-
quently f
is an approximation
to
'/2.
It may have been
arrived
at
in the tentative way here indicated
; we cannot
doubt that it was current in Plato's time
; nay, we know that
the general solution of the equations
a;2-2^2 = +
1
by means of successive
' side-
' and
' diameter-
' numbers was
Pythagorean, and
Plato was
therefore, here
as in so many
other
places,
' Pythagorizing
'.
The diameter
is again mentioned
in
the 'Politicus, where
Plato speaks
of
' the diameter which
is in square
(Svvdufi)
two
feet', meaning
the
diagonal
of
the square
with
side
1
foot, and
again
of the
diameter
of
the
square
on
this
diameter,
i. e. the diagonal of a square 2 square feet in area,
in other words, the
side of a square
4 square
feet in
area,
or a straight line 2 feet in length.'
Enough has been said to show that Plato was abreast of
the
mathematics
of
his
day, and we
can
understand
the
remark
of
Proclus on
the influence which he exerted upon
students and workers in that field
' he caused mathematics in general and geometry in particular
to make a very great advance by reason of his enthusiasm
for them, which of course
is obvious from the way in which
he filled his books \Yith mathematical illustrations and every-
where tries
to kindle admiration for these subjects in those
who make a pursuit of philosophy.'
Mathematical

Besides the purely theoretical subjects, Plato recognizes the
practical or applied mathematical
' arts
'

Plato

The account
of
the process
of
vision and
the
relation
of
vision
to the
light of day is interesting,* and at the end of
it
is a reference
to the properties of mirrors, which is perhaps the first indica-
tion of a science of optics.
When, says Plato, we see a thing
in a mirror, the fire belonging to the face copibines about the
bright surface of the mirror with the fire in the visual current
;
the right portion of the face appears as the
left in the image
seen, and vice versa, because
it
is the mutually opposite parts
of the visual current and of the object seen which come into
contact, contrary to the usual mode of impact.
(That is, if you
imagine your reflection in the mirror
to be another person
looking at you, his left eye is the image of your right, and the
left side of his left eye
is the image of the right side of your
right.)
But, on the other hand, the right side really becomes
the right side and the
left the
left when the light in com-
bination with that with which it combines is transferred from
one
side
to the other;
this happens when the smooth part
of the mirror is higher at the sides than in the middle
(i. e. the
mirror
is
a
hollow
cylindrical
mirror
held
with
its
axis
vertical), and so diverts the right portion of the visual current
to the left and vice versa.
And if you turn the mirror so that
its axis is horizontal, everything appears upside down.

PLATO

3Iusic.
In
music Plato had
the advantage
of
the
researches
of
Archytas
and
the
Pythagorean
school
into
the
numerical
relations
of
tones.
In
the
Tiniaeus we
find an
elaborate
filling up of intervals by the interposition of arithmetic and
. harmonic means ^
; Plato
is also
clear that higher and lower
pitch are due to the more or
less rapid motion of the
air.^
In
like manner the
dififerent notes in the 'harmony
of
the
spheres
', poetically turned into Sirens
sitting^ on each of the
eight whorls of the Spindle and each uttering a single sound,
a single musical note, correspond
to the
different speeds
of
the eight circles, that of the fixed stars and those of the sun,
the moon, and the five planets respectively/'
(y)
Astronomy.
This brings us to Plato's astronomy.
His views are stated
in their most complete and final form in the Timaeus, though
account has to be taken of other dialogues, the Fhaedo, the
Republic, and the Laws.
He based himself upon the early
Pythagorean system
(that
of
Pythagoras,
as
distinct
from
that
of
his
successors, who
wex'e the
first
to abandon
the
geocentric
system and made
the
earth, with
the
sun,
the
moon and the other planets, revolve in circles about the
' cen-
tral
fire ')
;
while
of
course he would
take
account of
the
results
of
the more and more
exact observations made up
to his own time.
According
to
Plato, the universe has the
most perfect of
all
shapes, that of a sphere.
In the centre
of this sphere rests the
earth, immovable and kept there by
the
equilibrium
of
symmetry
as
it
were
('for
a thing
in
equilibrium in the middle of any uniform substance will not
have cause to incline more or
less in any direction
'
'').
The
axis of the sphere of the universe passes through the centre of
the
earth, which
is
also
spherical, and the sphere revolves
uniformly about the axis in the direction from east to west.
The fixed
stars are therefore
carried round in small
circles
of the sphere.
The
sun, the moon and
the five planets are
also carried round in the motion of the outer sphere, but they
have independent circular movements of their own in addition.

These
latter movements take
place
in
a
plane which
cuts
at an angle the equator of the heavenly sphere
; the several
orbits are parts of what Plato calls the
' circle of the Other
',
as distinguished from the
' circle of the Same ', which
is the
daily revolution of the heavenly sphere as a whole and which,
carrying
the
circle
of the Other and the seven movements
therein along with it, has the mastery over them.
The result
of the combination of the two movements in the case of any
one planet is
to twist
its actual path in space into a spiral ^
;
the spiral is of course included between two planes parallel to
that
of
the
equator
at
a
distance
equal
to
the maximum
deviation
of
the
planet
in
its
course from
the equator on
either
side.
The speeds with which the
sun, the moon and
the
five
planets
describe
their own
orbits
(independently
of the daily rotation) are in the following order
; the moon is
the quickest;
the sun
is the next quickest and Venus and
Mercury travel in company' with
it, each of the three taking
about a year to describe
its orbit
; the next in speed is Mars,
the next
Jupiter, and
the
last and
slowest
is Saturn
;
the
speeds are of
course angular
speeds, not
linear.
The order
of
distances from the
earth
is, beginning with the
nearest,
as follows
: moon, sun, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.
In the Republic all these heavenly bodies describe their own
orbits in a sense opposite to that of the daily rotation,
i. e. in
the
direction
from
west
to
east
;
this
is what we
should
expect;
but
in
the
Ti'maeus we are
distinctly
told,
in one
place, that the seven circles move
' in opposite senses to one
another',^ and, in
another
place, that Venus and
Mercury
have
'the
contrary
tendency'
to
the
sun.^
This
peculiar
phrase has not been satisfactorily interpreted.
The two state-
ments taken together in their
literal sense appear to imply
that Plato actually regarded Venus and Mercury as describing
their orbits the contrary way to the sun, incredible as this
may appear
(for on this hypothesis the angles of divergence
between the two planets and the sun would be capable of any
value up to
180Â°, whereas observation shows that they are
never far from the sun).
Proclus and others refer to attempts
to explain the passages by means of the theory of epicycles
;
Chalcidius in particular indicates that the sun's motion on its
1 Timaeus, 38 E-39 B.

PLATO
epicycle (which is from east to west) is in the contrary sense
to
the
motion
of
Venus
and
Mercury
on
their
epicycles
respectively (which
is from west to east) ^
; and this would
be a satisfactory explanation
if Plato could be supposed to
have been acquainted with the theory of epicycles.
But the
probabilities are entirely against the latter supposition.
All,
therefore, that can be
said seems
to be
this.
Heraclides of
Pontus, Plato's famous pupil,
is known on clear evidence
to
have discovered that Venus and Mercury revolve
rouiid the
sun like satellites.
He may have come to the same conclusion
about the superior planets, but this is not certain
; and in any
case he must
have made
the discovery with
reference
to
Mercury and Venus
first.
Heraclides's discovery meant that
Venus and Mercury, while accompanying the sun in its annual
motion, described what are
really
epicycles about
it.
Now
discoveries of this sort aie not made without some preliminary
seeking, and
it may have been some vague inkling of the
truth that prompted the remark of Plato, whatever the precise
meaning of the words.
The differences between the angular speeds of the planets
account
for the
overtakings
of one planet by another, and
the combination of their independent motions with that of the
daily rotation causes one planet to a'pl^ar to be overtaking
another when
it
is
really
being overtaken by
it and
vice
versa.^
The
sun, moon
and
planets
are
instruments
for
measuring time.^
Even the earth is an instrument for making
night and day by virtue of
its
not rotating about its axis,
while the rotation
of the fixed
stars carrj'ing the sun with
it is completed once in twenty-four hours
; a month has passed
when the moon after completing her own orbit overtakes the
sun
(the 'month' being therefore
the synodic month), and
a year when the sun has completed its own circle.
According
to Plato the time
of revolution of the other planets (except
Venus and Mercury, which have the same speed as the sun)
had
not been
exactly
calculated
;
nevertheless
the
Perfect
Year
is completed
' when the relative speeds of
all the eight
revolutions [the seven independent revolutions and the
daily
rotation] accomplish
their
course
together and
reach

There was apparently a tradition that the
Great Year of
Plato was 36000 years
:
this corresponds to
the minimum
estimate
of
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
quoted by Ptolemy from Hipparchus's treatise on the length
of the
year, namely
at
least one-hundredth of a degree
in
a year, or 1Â° in 100 years,^ that is to say, 360Â° in 36000 years.
The period
is connected by Adam with the Geometrical Num-
ber 12960000 because this number of days, at the rate of 360
days in the year, makes 36000 years.
The coincidence may,
it
is
true, have struck Ptolemy and made him
describe
the
Great
Year
arrived
at on
the
basis
of
1Â°
per
100
years
as the
' Platonic
'
year
;
but there
is nothing
to show that
Plato himself calculated a Great Year with reference to pre-
cession
: on the contrary, precession was
first discovered by
Hipparchus.
As
regards
the
distances
of
the
sun, moon and
planets
Plato has nothing more
definite than that the seven circles
are
' in the proportion of the double intervals, three of each
' ^
:
the reference is to the Pythagorean rerpa/cTi/y represented in
the annexed figure, the numbers after 1 being
on the one side successive powers of
2, and on
the other side successive powers of 3.
This
gives
1,
2,
3,
4,
8,
9, 27 in ascending order.
What precise estimate
of relative distances
Plato based upon these figures is uncertain.
It
is generally supposed
(1) that the radii
of the successive
orbits are in the ratio of the numbers;
but
(2)
Chalcidius
considered
that
2,
3,
4
...
are
the
successive
difi'erences
between
these
radii,*
so
that
the
radii
themselves
are
in
the ratios of
1,
1-1-2 = 3,
1 -f 2 -H 3 = 6,
&c.
;
and again
(3),
according to Macrobius,^ the Platonists held that the successive
radii are as
1,
1
. 2 =
2, 1.2.3 =
6,
6
. 4 = 24, 24
. 9 = 216,
216.8 = 1728
and
1728
. 27 = 46656.
In
any
case
the
figures have no basis in observation.
We have said that Plato made the earth occupy the centre
of the universe and gave it no movement of any kind.

views, however, have been attributed to Plato by later writers.
In the Timacus Plato had used of the earth the expression
which has usually been translated 'our nurse, globed
(/AAo-
IJiivrjv) round
the
axis stretched from pole to pole through
the universe '}
It
is well known that Aristotle refers to the
passage in these terms
' Some say that the earth, actually lying at the centre {koi
Keijxevqv km rod Kifrpov), is yet wound and
inioves (iXXecrOai
Kal
Kiyiitrdai) about the axis stretched through the universe
from pole to pole.'^
This naturally implies that
Aristotle attributed
to
Plato
the view that the earth rotates about its axis.
Such a view
is,
however,
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
whole
system
described in the Tlmaeus (and also in the Laivs, which Plato
did
not
live
to
finish), where
it
is the sphere of the
fixed
stars which by
its
revolution about
the earth
in
24 hours
makes night and day
; moreover, there is no reason to doubt
the evidence that
it was Heraelides of Pontus who was the
first
to
affirm the
rotation
of the earth about
its own
axis
in 24 hours.
The natural inference seems to be that Aristotle
either misunderstood or misrepresented
Plato, the ambiguity
of
the word
tWofievrjv
being the contributing cause or the
pretext as the case may be.
There
are, however, those who
maintain that Aristotle must have known what Plato meant
and was incapable of misrepresenting him on a subject like
this.
Among these is Professor Burnet,^ who, being satisfied
that Aristotle understood
L\Xo/j.(i'r]v to mean motion of some
sort, and on
the
strength
of
a new reading which he has
adopted from two MSS. of the
first
class, has essayed a new
interpretation
of
Plato's
phrase.
The new
reading
differs
from
the
former
texts
in
having
the
article
r^r
after
iXXo/j.ei'iju, which makes the phrase run thus,

Burnet, holding that we
can only supply with

and translates
' earth our nurse going to and fro on
its path
round the axis which stretches right through the universe'.

In
confirmation
oi'
this
Burnet
cites
the
' unimpeachable
testimony
' of Theophrastus, who said that
' Plato
in
his
old age
repented
of having given the
earth
the central place in the universe, to which it had no right
' ^
;
and he concludes
that, according to Plato
in
the
Timaeus,
the earth is not the centre of the universe.
But the sentences
in which Aristotle paraphrases the IWojiivrjv
in the Timaeus
by the words iWeaOat
km. Kiveiadai both make
it clear that
the
persons who
held
the
view
in question
also
declared
that
the
earth
lies or
is placed
at
the centre
(Kfifiifrjy
enl
Tov KiVTpov), or
' placed the earth at the centre
' {km rod /lea-ov
6evTes).
Burnet's explanation is therefore in contradiction to
part of
Aristotle's statement,
if not to the
rest;
so that he
does not appear to have brought the
question much nearer
to a solution.
Perhaps some one will suggest that the rotation
or oscillation about the axis of the universe is small, so small
as to be fairly consistent with the statement that the earth
remains at the
centre.
Better,
I think, admit
that, on our
present information, the puzzle is insoluble.
The dictum
of
Theophrastus
that
Plato
in
his
old
age
repented of having placed the
earth, in the centre
is incon-
sistent with the
theory of
the
Timaeus,
as we have
said.
Boeckh explained
it
as
a misapprehension.
There appear
to have been among
Plato's immediate successors some who
altered Plato's system in a Pythagorean sense and who may
be alluded to in another passage of the De caelo^; Boeckh
suggested, therefore, that the
views of
these Pythagorizing
Platonists may have been put down to Plato himself.
But
the tendency now
seems
to
be
to
accept the testimony
of
Theophrastus literally.
Heiberg does so, and so does Burnet,
who thinks it probable that Theophrastus heard the statement
which he attributes to Plato from Plato himself.
But I would
point out that, if the Timaeus, as Burnet contends, contained
Plato's explicit recantation of his former view that the earth
was at the centre, there was no need to supplement
it by an
oral communication to Theophrastus.
In any case the question
has no particular importance in comparison with the develop-
ments which have next to be described.

X
FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
Whateyer original work Plato himself did in mathematics
(and it may not have been much), there
is no doubt that his
enthusiasm for the subject in all branches and the pre-eminent
place which he gave it in his system had enormous influence
upon its development in his lifetime and the period following.
In astronomy we
are told that Plato set
it as a problem to
all earnest students to find
' what are the uniform and ordered
movements by the assumption of which the apparent move-
ments of the planets can be accounted for
'
; our authority for
this
is Sosigenes, who had
it from Eudemus.^
One answer
to this, representing an advance second to none in the history
of astronomy, was given by
Heraclides
of
Pontus,
one
of
Plato's
pupils
{circa
388-310
B.C.);
the
other, which
was
by Eudoxus and on purely mathematical
lines,
constitutes
one of the most remarkable achievements in pure geometry
that
the
whole
of
the history
of
mathematics
can
show.
Both were philosophers of extraordinary range.
Heraclides
wrote works of the -highest class both in matter and style:
the catalogue
of them
covers subjects
ethical, grammatical,
musical and
poetical,
rhetorical,
historical
; and there were
geometrical
and
dialectical
treatises
as
well.
Similarly
Eudoxus,
celebrated
as
philosopher,
geometer,
astronomer,
geographer, physician and legislator, commanded and enriched
almost the whole field of learning.
Heraclides of Pontus
:
astronomical
discoveries.
Heraclides held that the apparent daily revolution of the
heavenly bodies round the earth was accounted
for, not by
' Simpl. on De caelo,
ii. 12 (292 h 10), p. 488. 20-34, Heib.

HERACLIDES. ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES

the circular motion
of the stars round the earth, but by the
rotation
of the
earth about
its own
axis
;
several passages
attest this,
e. g.
' Heraclides
of
Pontus supposed
that
the earth
is
in
the
centre and rotates
(lit.
' moves in a circle ') while the heaven
is
at
rest, and he thought by
this supposition to save the
phenomena.'
True,
Heraclides may
not have been alone in holding
this
view, for we are told that Ecphantus of Syracuse, a Pytha-
gorean,
also
asserted
that
' the
earth,
being
in
the
centre
of the universe, moves about
its own centre in an eastward
direction
' ^
; when Cicero ^ says the same thing of Hicetas, also
of Syracuse, this
is probably due to a confusion.
But there
is no doubt of the originality of the other capital discovery
made by Heraclides, namely that Venus and Mercury revolve,
like
satellites, round the sun as
centre.
If, as
Schiaparelli
argued, Heraclides
also came to the same
conclusion about
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, he anticipated the hypothesis of
Tycho Brahe (or rather improved on
it), but the evidence
is
insufficient to establish this, and I think the probabilities are
against
it;
there
is
some reason
for thinking
that
it was
Apollonius of Perga who thus completed what Heraclides had
begun and put forward the full Tychonic hypothesis.*
But
there
is nothing to detract from the merit of Heraclides in
having pointed the way to it.
Eudoxus's theory
of
concentric
spheres
is even more
re-
markable as a mathematical achievement
;
it is worthy of the
man who invented
the
great theory
of
proportion
set out
in
Euclid, Book V, and the powerful 'method of exhaustion
which not only enabled the areas of circles and the volumes
of pyramids, cones, spheres, &c., to be obtained, but
is at the
root of all Archimedes's further developments in the mensura-
tion
of
plane
and
solid
figures.
But,
before we come
to
Eudoxus, there are certain other names to be mentioned.

FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
Theory
of numbers
(Speusippus,
Xenocrates).
To begin with arithmetic or the theory of numbers.
Speu-
sippus, nephew oÂ£ Plato, who succeeded him as head of the
school, is said to have made a particular study of Pythagorean
doctrines, especially of the works of
Philolaus, ^and to have
written
a
small
treatise On
the
Pythagorean Numbers
of
which a fragment, mentioned above
(pp.
72,
75, 76)
is
pre-
served in the Theologumena Arithmetices}
To judge by the
fragment, the work was not one of importance.
The arith-
metic in
it was evidently of the geometrical type (polygonal
numbers, for example, being represented by dots making up
the particular figures).
The portion of the book dealing with
' the five figures (the regular solids) which are assigned to the
cosmic
elements,
their
particularity
and
their
community
with one another
', can hardly have gone beyond the putting
together of the figures by faces, as we find it in the Timaeus.
To Plato's distinction of the fundamental triangles, the equi-
lateral, the isosceles right-angled, and the half of an equilateral
triangle
cut
oflF by
a
perpendicular from
a
vertex on
the
opposite
side, he adds a
distinction
(' passablement
futile',
as
is
the
whole
fragment
in
Tannery's
opinion)
o^
four
pyramids (1) the regular pyramid, with an equilateral triangle
for base and all the edges equal, (2) the pyramid on a square
base, and (evidently) having its four edges terminating at the
corners of the base equal,
(3) the pyramid which is the half of
the preceding one obtained by drawing a plane through the
vertex
so as to cut the
base
perpendicularly in a diagonal
of
the
base,
(4) a pyramid
constructed on
the
half
of an
equilateral triangle as base; the object was, by calling these
pyramids a monad, a dyad, a triad and a tetrad respectively,
to make up the number 10, the special properties and virtues
of which as set forth by the Pythagoreans were the subject of
the second half of the work.
Proclus quotes a few opinions
of Speusippus
;
e. g., in the matter of theorems and problems,
he differed from Menaechmus, since he regarded both
alike
as being more properly theorems, while Menaechmus would
call both alike jJroblems.^

votes over Heraclides,
is also
said
to have written a book
it, Xumhers and a Theory of Nuinhers,
besides books on geometry.^
These books have not survived,
but we learn that Xenocrates upheld the Platonic tradition in
requiring of those who would enter the school a knowledge of
music, geometry and astronomy
;
to one who was not pro-
ficient in these things he said
' Go thy way, for thou hast not
the means of getting a grip of philosophy'.
Plutarch says
that he put at 1,002,000,000,000 the number of syllables which
could be formed out
of the letters of the alphabet.^
If the
story is true, it represents the first attempt on record to solve
a difficult problem in permutations and combinations.
Xeno-
crates was a supporter of
' indivisible lines '(and
magnitudes)
by which he thought
to get over the paradoxical arguments
of Zeno.^

Proclus's summary
{continued).
In geometry we have more names mentioned
in the sum-
mary of Proclus.*
' Younger than Leodamas were Neoclides and his pupil Leon,
who added many
things
to what was known
before
their
time,
so
that Leon was
actually able
to make a collection
of the elements more carefully designed
in
respect both
of
the number of propositions proved and of their utility, besides
which he invented diorismi (the object of which
is to deter-
mine) when
the problem under investigation
is
possible
of
solution and when impossible.'
Of Neoclides and Leon we know nothing more than what
is here stated; but the definite recognition of the
Siopia-fios,
that
is, of the necessity
of finding, as a preliminary to the
solution
of a problem, the
conditions
for the possibility of
a
solution,
represents
an
advance
in
the
philosophy
and
technology
of mathematics.

that
the thing
itself had
not
been met with before:

Siopia-fios indicated in the famous geometrical passage of the
Meno''-; no doubt, too, the geometrical solution by the Pytha-
goreans of the quadratic equation would
incidentally make
clear to them the
limits of
possibility corresponding to the
Sioptafios
in the solution
of the most general form of quad-
ratic
in
Eucl. VI.
27-9, where, in the case of the
'deficient'
parallelogram
(Prop.
28),
the
enunciation
states
that
' the
given rectilineal figure must not be greater than the parallelo-
gram described on half of the straight line and similar to the
defect
'.
Again, the condition of the possibility of constructing
a triangle
out
of
three given straight
lines
(Eucl.
I.
22),
namely that any two of them must be together greater than
the third, must have been perfectly familiar long before Leon
or Plato.
Proclus continues
:
^
' Eudoxus of Cnidos, a
little younger than Leon, who had
been
associated
with
the
school
of
Plato, was
the
first
to
increase
the number of the
so-called
general theorems
;
he
also added three other proportions to the three already known,
and
multiplied
the
theorems
which
originated with
Plato
about the
section, applying
to them the method of analysis.
Amyclas
[more
correctly Amyntas]
of Heraclea, one
of the
friends of
Plato, Menaechmus, a pupil of Eudoxus who had
also studied with
Plato, and Dinostratus,
his
brother, made
the
whole
of
geometry
still
more
perfect.
Theudius
of
Magnesia had the reputation of excelling in mathematics
as
well
as
in
the
other
branches
of
philosophy
;
for he
put
together the elements admirably and made many partial
(or
limited) theorems more general.
Again, Athenaeus of Cyzicus,
who
lived
about
the
same
time, became
famous
in
other
branches of mathematics and most of all in geometry.
These
men consorted together in the Academy and conducted their
investigations in common.
Hermotimus of Colophon carried
further the investigations already opened up by Eudoxus and
Theaetetus,
discovered many
propositions
of
the Elements
and compiled some portion of the theory of Loci.
Philippus
of Medma, who was a pupil of Plato and took up mathematics
at
his
instance,
not
only
carried
out
his
investigations
in
accordance with
Plato's instructions but
also
set himself to
do whatever
in
his view
contributed to the
philosophy
of
Plato.'

THE ELEMENTS
331
It
will
be
well
to
dispose
of
the
smaller names
in
this
list
before
taking
up
Eudoxus,
the
principal
subject
of
this
chapter.
The name
of Amyclas
should
apparently be
Amyntas,^ although Diogenes Laertius mentions Amyclos of
Heraclea in Pontus as a pupil of Plato ^ and has elsewhere an
improbable story of one Amyclas, a Pythagorean, who with
Clinias is supposed to have dissuaded Plato from burning the
works
of
Dernocritus
in view
of
the
fact
that there were
many other copies
in circulation.^
Nothing more
is known
of Amyntas, Theudius, Athenaeus and Hermotimus than what
is
stated
in the above passage
of
Proclus.
It
is
probable,
however, that the propositions, &c., in elementary geometry
which are quoted by Aristotle were taken from the Elements
of Theudius, which would no doubt be the text-book of the
time just preceding Euclid.
Of Menaechmus and Dinostratus
we
have
already
learnt
that
the
former
discovered
conic
sections, and used them
for finding two mean proportionals,
and that the
latter applied the quadratrix to the squaring
of the circle.
Philippus of Medma (vulg. Mende) is doubtless
the same person as Philippus of Opus, who
is said to have
revised and published the Laws of Plato which had been left
unfinished, and
to have
been
the author of the Ejdnomis.
He
wrote
upon
astronomy
chiefly;
the astronomy
in
the
Epinomis
follows that of the Laws and the Timaeus
;
but
Suidas records the
titles of other works by him
as follows
:
On the distance of the sun and moon, On
the
ecli'pse of the
moon, On
the
size of the
sun, the moon and
the
earth, On
the planets.
A passage of Aetius * and another of Plutarch ^
alluding
to
his
p/roofs
about
the
shape of the moon may
indicate that Philippus was the fii-st to establish the complete
theory of the phases of the moon.
In mathematics, accord-
ing
to
the
same
notice by
Suidas,
he wrote Arithmetica,
Means, On
polygonal
numbers,
Cyclica,
Optics,
Enoptrica
(On mirrors)
;
but nothing is known of the contents of these
works.

FROM PLATO. TO EUCLID
According to Apollodorus, EuDOXUS flourished in 01. 103 =
368-365 B. C, from which we infer that he was born about 408
B. C, and (since he lived 53 years) died about 355 B. C.
In his
23rd year he went to Athens with the physician Theomedon,
and there for two months he attended lectures on philosophy
and oratory, and in particular the lectures of Plato; so poor
was he that he took up his abode at the Piraeus and trudged
to Athens and back on foot each day.
It would appear that
his journey
to
Italy
and
Sicily
to
study
geometry
with
Archytas,
and
medicine
with
Philistion,
must
have
been
earlier than
the
first
visit
to Athens, for from Athens
he
returned
to
Gnidos,
after
which
he went
to
Egypt with
a
letter of introduction
to King Nectanebus, given him by
Agesilaus; the date of this journey was probably 381-380 B.C.
or a
little
later, and he
stayed
in
Egypt
sixteen
months.
After that he went to Cyzicus, where he collected round him
a large school which he took with him to Athens in 368 B.C.
or a little later.
There
is apparently no foundation for the
story mentioned by Diogenes Laertius that he took up a hostile
attitude
to
Plato,'^ nor on the other
side for the statements
that he went with Plato to Egypt and spent thirteen years
in the company
of the Egyptian
priests, or that he
visited
Plato when
Plato was
with
the younger Dionysius on
his
third visit to Sicily in 361 B. c.
Returning later to his native
place, Eudoxus was by a popular vote entrusted with legisla-
tive office.
When
in
Egypt
Eudoxus
assimilated
the
astronomical
knowledge
of
the
priests
of
Heliopolis
and
himself made
observations.
The observatory between Heliopolis and Cerce-
sura used by him was
still pointed out in Augustus's time
he also had one built at Gnidos, and from there he observed
the
star
Canopus
which was
not
then
visible
in
higher
latitudes.
It was doubtless to record the observations thus
made
that
he
wrote
the two books
attributed
to him by
Hipparchus, the Mirror and the Phaenomena ^
; it seems, how-
ever, unlikely that
there could have been two independent
works dealing with the same subject, and the latter, from which

EUDOXUS
323
the poem of Aratus was drawn, so
far as verses 19-732
are
concerned, may have been a revision of the former work and
even, perhaps, posthumous.
But it is the theoretical side of Eudoxus's astronomy rather
than
the
observational
that
has
importance
for
us;
and,
indeed, no
more
ingenious
and
attractive
hypothesis than
that of Eudoxus's system of concentric spheres has ever been
put forward to account for the apparent motions of the sun,
moon
and
planets.
It
was
the
first attempt
at
a
purely
mathematical theory of astronomy, and, with the great and
immortal contributions which he made to geometry, puts him
in
the very
first rank of mathematicians
of
all
time.
He
was a man of science
if there ever was one.
No occult or
superstitious lore appealed to him
; Cicero says that Eudoxus,
' in astrologia iudicio doctissimorum hominum facile princeps
',
expressed the opinion and
left
it on record that no sort of
credence should be given to the Chaldaeans in their predic-
tions and their foretelling of the life of individuals from the
day of their birth. ^
Nor would he indulge in vain physical
speculations on things which were inaccessible to observation
and
experience
in
his
time
;
thus,
instead
of
guessing
at
the nature
of
the
sun,
he
said
that
he would
gladly be
burnt up like Phaethon
if at that price he could get to the
sun and so
ascertain
its
form,
size, and
nature.^
Another
story
(this
time
presumably
apocryphal)
is
to
the
effect
that he grew
old
at
the top
of
a very high mountain
in
the attempt
to discover the movements of the stars and the
heavens.^
In our account of his work we will begin with the sentence
about him in
Proclus's summary.
First, he
is said
to have
increased
'the number
of
the
so-called general
theorems'.
'So-called general theorems' is an odd phrase;
it occurred to
me whether
this could mean theorems which were true
of
everything falling under the conception of magnitude, as are
the definitions and theorems forming part of Eudoxus's own
theory of proportion, which applies
to numbers, geometrical
magnitudes of all sorts, times, &c.

FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
at the beginning of Euclid's Book X similarly refer to magni-
tudes in general, and the proposition
X.,

its equivalent
was actually used by Eudoxus
in his method of exhaustion,
as it is by Euclid in his application of the same method to the
theorem
(among
others)
of
XII.
2
that
circles
are
to
one
another as the squares on their diameters.
The three
' proportions
' or means added to the three pre-
viously known (the arithmetic, geometric and harmonic) have
already been
mentioned
(p.
86), and,
as
they are
alterna-
tively attributed to others, they need not detain us here.
Thirdly, we are told that Eudoxus
' extended
' or
' increased
the number of the
(propositions) about
the section
(to, mpl
Tr}v
To/j-rju)
which
originated with
Plato, applying
to them
the method of
analysis'.
What is the sectionl
The sugges-
tion which
has been
received with most favour
is
that of
Bretschneider,! who pointed out that up to
Plato's time there
was only
one
' section
'
that
had any
real
significance
in
geometry, namely the section of a straight
line
in
extreme
and mean ratio which
is obtained in Eucl. II.
1 1 and is used
again in Eucl. IV. 10-14 for the construction
of a pentagon.
These theorems were, as we have seen, pretty certainly Pytha-
gorean,
like the whole of the substance of Euclid, Book
11.
Plato may therefore, says Bretschneider, have directed atten-
tion afresh to this subject and investigated the metrical rela-
tions between the segments of a
straight
line
so cut, while
Eudoxus may have continued the investigation where Plato
left off.
Now the passage of Proclus says that, in extending
the theorems about
' the section
', Eudoxus applied the method
of
analysis;
and we
actually
find
in
Eucl.
XIII.
1-5
five
propositions about straight
lines cut in extreme and mean
ratio
followed, in
the MSS., by
definitions of
analysis and
synthesis, and
alternative
proofs of
the same
propositions
in the form
of analysis followed by synthesis.
Here, then,
Bretschneider thought he had found a fragment of some actual
work
by
Eudoxus
corresponding
to
Proclus's
description.
But it is certain that the definitions and the alternative proofs
were
interpolated by
some
scholiast,
and, judging by
the
figures (which are merely straight
lines) and by comparison
1 Bretschneider,
Die
Geometrie

vor Eukleides,
pp.
167-9.
"

EUDOXUS
325
with
the
remarks on
analysis and
synthesis
quoted
from
Heron by An-Nairizi at the beginning oi' his commentary on
Eucl. Book II, it seems most likely that the interpolated defini-
tions and proofs
were taken from
Heron.
Bretsehneider's
argument based on Eucl. XIII. 1-5 accordingly breaks down,
and all that can be said further
is that, if Eudoxus investi-
gated the relation between the segments of the straight
line,
he would find in it a case of incommensurability which would
further enforce the necessity for a theory of proportion which
should be applicable to incommensurable as well as to com-
mensurable
magnitudes.
Proclus
actually
observes
that
' theorems about sections like those in
Euclid's Second Book
are common to both [arithmetic and geometry] except that in
which
the straight
line
is cut
in extreme and mean ratio'
(cf.
Eucl.
XIII.
6
for
the
actual
proof of the
irrationality
in this case).
Opinion, however, has not even in recent years
been unanimous in favour of Bretsehneider's interpretation
;
Tannery ^
in
particular
preferred
the
old view, which pre-
vailed
before Bretschneider, that
' section
' meant section of
solids,
e.g.
l)y
planes,
a
line
of investigation which would
naturally precede the discovery of conies
; he pointed out that
the
use
of
the
singular,
rJ)r
rojiriv, which might no doubt
be taken as
' section
' in the abstract, is no real objection, that
there
is no other passage which speaks of a certain section
par
excellence, and that
Proclus in
the
words
just quoted
expresses himself quite differently, speaking of
'.sections'
of
which
the particular
section
in extreme and mean
ratio
is
only one.
Presumably the question
will never be more defi-
nitely settled unless by the discovery of new documents.
(a)
Theory of 2y>'oportion.
The anonymous author of a scholium to Euclid's Book V,
who
is perhaps
Proclus,
tells
us
that
' some say
' that this
Book, containing the general theory of proportion which
is
equally
applicable
to
geometry,
arithmetic,
music
and
all
mathematical science,
' is the discovery of Eudoxus, the teacher
of
Plato '.^
There
is no
reason
to doubt the truth
of this

FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
statement.
The new
theory appears
to have been
already-
familiar to
Aristotle.
Moreover, the fundamental principles
show clear points
of contact with those used in the method
of exiiaustion, also due to Eudoxus.
I refer to the definition
(Eucl. V, Def. 4) of magnitudes having a ratio to one another,
which are said to be
' such as are capable, when
(sufficiently)
multiplied,
of
exceeding one another';
compare
with
this
Archimedes's 'lemma' by means of which he says that the
theorems about the volume of a pyramid and about
circles
being to one another as the squares on their diameters were
proved, namely that
' of unequal
lines, unequal
surfaces, or
unequal
solids,
the
greater
exceeds
the
less
by
such
a
magnitude
as
is capable,
if added
(continually)
to
itself, of
exceeding any magnitude
of those which are comparable to
one
another
',
i. e.
of
magnitudes of the same kind
as
the
original magnitudes.
The essence
of the new theory was that
it was applicable
to
incommensurable
as well
as
commensurable
quantities
and
its
importance
cannot
be
overrated,
for
it
enabled
geometry to go forward again, after it had received the blow
which paralysed
it for the time.
This was the discovery of
the irrational, at a time when geometry still depended on the
Pythagorean
theory
of
proportion,
that
is,
the
numerical
theory which was of course applicable only to eommensurables.
The discovery of incommensurables must have caused what
Tannery
described
as
' un
veritable
seandale
logique
'
in
geometry, inasmuch
as
it made
inconclusive
all
the proofs
which had depended on the old theory of proportion.
One
effect would naturally be
to make geometers avoid the use
of proportions as much as possible; they would have to use
other methods wherever they could.
Euclid's Books I-IV no
doubt largely represent the result of the consequent remodel-
ling
of fundamental
propositions; and the ingenuity of the
substitutes devised is nowhere better illustrated than in I. 44,
45, where the equality of the complements about the diagonal
of a parallelogram
is
used
(instead
of
the
construction,
as
in Book
VI,
of
a
fourth
pi'oportional)
for the
purpose
of
applying to a given straighj; line a parallelogram in a given
angle and equal to a given triangle or rectilineal area.
The
greatness
of
the new theory
itself needs no

EUDOXUS'S THEORY OF PROPORTION

argument when it is remembered that the definition of equal
ratios
in
Eucl. V, Def.
5 corresponds exactly to the modern
theory of irrationals due to Dedekind, and that
it is word for
word the same as Weierstrass's definition of equal numbers.
(^)
The method of exhaustion.
In the preface to Book
I of his treatise On the Sphere and
Cylinder Archimedes attributes to Eudoxus the proof of the
theorems
that
the
volume
of
a
pyramid
is
one-third
of
the volume of the prism which has the same base and equal
height, and
that the volume
of a cone
is
one-third of the
cylinder with the same base and height.
In the Method he
says
that
these
facts
were
discovered,
though
not
proved
(i.e.
in
Archimedes's
sense
of
the
word),
by
Democritus,
who accordingly deserved a great part of the credit for the
theorems,
but
that Eudoxus was
the
first
to
supply
the
scientific proof.
In the preface to the Quadrature of the Para-
bola Archimedes gives further
details.
He says that for the
proof of the theorem that the area of a segment of a parabola
cut off by a cliord is frds of the triangle on the same base and
of equal height with the segment he himself used the
' lemma
quoted above (now known as the Axiom of Archimedes), and
he goes on
:
' The earlier geometers have also used this lemma
;
for it is
by the use of this lemma that they have proved the proposi-
tions (1) that circles are to one another in the duplicate ratio
of their diameters,
(2) that spheres are to one another in the
triplicate ratio of their diameters, and further
(3) that every
pyramid
is one third part of the prism which has the same
base with the pyramid and equal height
;
also
(4) that every
cone
is one third part of the cylinder having the same base
with
the
cone and
equal
height
they proved by assuming
a certain lemma similar to that aforesaid.'
As, according
to the other
passage,
it was Eudoxus who
first
proved
the
last two
of
these
theorems,
it
is
a
safe
inference that he used for this purpose the
' lemma
' in ques-
tion or its equivalent.
But was he the first to use the lemma ?
This
has been
questioned
on
the ground
that one
of
the
theorems mentioned
as having
Ijeen proved by
' the
earlier
geometers
' in this way is the theorem that
circles are to one

328
FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
another as the squares on their diameters, which proposition,
as we
are
told on the
authority
of Eudemus, was proved
(Sd^ai) by Hippocrates of Chios.
This suggested to Hankel
that the lemma
in question must have been formulated by
Hippocrates and used in his proof. ^
But seeing that, accord-
ing to Archimedes,
' the earlier geometers ' proved by means
of the same lemrna both Hippocrates's proposition,
(1)
above,
and the theorem
(3) about the volume of a pyramid, while
the
first proof of the latter was certainly given by Eudoxus,
it is simplest to suppose that it was Eudoxus who first formu-
lated the
' lemma
' and used it to prove both propositions, and
that
Hippocrates's
'proof
did
not amount
to
a
rigorous
demonstration
such
as
would
have
satisfied
Eudoxus
or
Archimedes.
Hippocrates may, for instance, have proceeded
v^on the lines of Antiphon's
' quadrature
', gradually exhausting
the circles and taking
the Limit, without clinching the proof
by the formal rediictio ad ahsurdiim, used in the method of
exhaustion as practised later.
Without therefore detracting
from
the merit
of Hippocrates, whose argument may have
contained the germ of the method of exhaustion, we do not
seem
to
have" any
sufficient
reason
to
doubt
that
it was
Eudoxus who established this method as part of the regular
machinery of geometry.
The
' lemma
' itself, we may observe, is not found in Euclid
in
precisely
the form
that Archimedes
gives
it, though
it
is equivalent to Eucl. V, Def. 4 (Magnitudes are said to have
a
ratio
to one another which are capable, when multiplied,
of exceeding one another).
When Euclid comes to prove the
propositions about the content of circles, pyramids and cones
(XII.
2, 4-7 Por., and
10), he does not use the actual lemma of
Archimedes, but another which forms Prop.
1 of Book X, to
the effect that, if there are two unequal magnitudes and from
the
greater
there
be
subtracted more than
its half
(or the
half itself), from the remainder more than its half (or the half),
and if this be done continually, there will be left some magni-
tude which will be less than the lesser of the given magnitudes.
This
last lemma
is frequently used by Archimedes himself
(notably in the second proof of the proposilion about the area
' Hankel, Zur Geschichte der Mathematik in Alterthum und Mittelalter,
p. 122.

EUDOXUS.
METHOD OF EXHAUSTION
329
of a
parabolic
segment), and
it may be the
' lemma similar
to the aforesaid
' which he says was used in the case of the
cone.
But the
existence
of the two lemmas constitutes no
real
difficulty, because Archimedes's lemma (under the form
of Eucl. V, Def. 4) is in effect used by Euclid to prove X.

We are not told whether Eudoxus proved the theorem that
spheres
are
to

another
in
the

ratio
of their
diameters.
As the proof of this in Eucl. XTI. 16-18 is likewise
based on X.
1 (which is used in XII.
16), it is probable enough
that this
proposition, mentioned along with
the
others by
Archimedes, was also first proved by Eudoxus.
Eudoxus, as we have seen, is said to have solved the problem
of
the two mean proportionals by means of
' curved lines
'.
This solution has been dealt with above
(pp. 249-51).
We pass on to the
(y)
Theory of concentric
spheres.
This was the first attempt to account by purely geometrical
hypotheses for the apparent
irregularities of the motions of
the planets
;
it included similar explanations of the apparently
simpler movements
of
the
sun
and
moon.
The
ancient
evidence of the
details of the system
of concentric
spheres
(which Eudoxus
set out in a book entitled On speeds, Tlepl
raxcov, now lost) is contained in two passages.
The first is in
Aristotle's Metapihysics, where a short notice
is given of the
numbers and relative positions of the spheres postulated by
Eudoxus
for
the
sun, moon
and
planets
respectively,
the
additions which
Callippus thought
it necessary to make
to
the numbers
of
those
spheres,
and
lastly
the
modification
of the system which
Aristotle
himself
considers
necessary
'if
the phenomena
are
to be produced by
all
the spheres
acting
in
combination '.^
A
more
elaborate
and
detailed
account of the system is contained in Simplicius's commentary
on the De caelo of Aristotle ^
; Simplicius quotes largely from
Sosigenes the Peripatetic (second century a. d.), observing that
Sosigenes drew from Eudemus, who dealt with the subject
in the second book of his History of Astronomy.

the
lirst
to
appreciate
the
elegance
of
the
theory and
to
attempt to explain its working (1828, 1830)
;
E. F. Apelt, too,
gave a fairly full exposition of it in a paper of 1849.
But it
was reserved for Schiaparelli to work out a complete restora-
tion
of
the
theory and
to
investigate
in
detail
the
extent
to which it could be made to account for the phenomena
;
his
paper has become a classic,^ and all accounts must necessarily
follow
his.
I shall here only describe the system so far as to show
its
mathematical interest.
I have given fuller details elsewhere.^
Eudoxus adopted the view which prevailed from the earliest
times to the time of Kepler, that circular motion was sufficient
to account
for
the movements
of
all
the heavenly
bodies.
With Eudoxus
this
circular motion
took
the
form
of the
revolution
of different
spheres, each
of which moves about
a
diameter
as
axis.
All
the
spheres
were
concentric, the
common centre being the centre of the earth
; hence the name
of
' homocentric
' spheres used in later times
to describe the
system.
The spheres were
of
different
sizes, one
inside the
other.
Each planet was
fixed
at a point in the equator of
the sphere which carried
it, the sphere revolving at uniform
speed
about
the diameter
joining
the corresponding poles
that is, the planet revolved uniformly in a great circle of the
sphere perpendicular to the axis of rotation.
But one such
circular motion
was
not
enough
;
in
order
to
explain the
changes in the apparent speed
of the
planets' motion,
their
stations and retrogradations, Eudoxus had to assume a number
of such circular motions working on each planet and producing
by their combination that single apparently irregular motion
which observation shows
us.
He accordingly held that the
poles
of
the
sphere carrying
the
planet
are not
fixed,
but
themselves move on
a
greater
sphere
concentric
with
the
carrying sphere and moving about two different poles with
uniform
speed.
The poles of
the second sphere were
simi-
larly placed on a
third
sphere
concentric
with and
larger
than the
first and second, and moving about separate
poles

of
its own with a speed peculiar to
itself.
For the planets
yet a fourth sphere was
required,
similarly
related
to
the
others
;
for the sun and moon
Eudoxus found
that, by
a
suitable choice
of
the
positions
of the
poles and
of
speeds
of
rotation, he could make three
spheres
suffice.
Aristotle
and Simplicius describe the spheres in the reverse order, the
sphere carrying the
planet being
the
last;
this makes the
description easier, because we begin with the sphere represent-
ing the
daily rotaton
of the
heavens.
The
spheres which
move each planet Eudoxus made quite
separate from those
which move
the others
;
but one sphere sufficed
to produce
the daily rotation of the heavens.
The hypothesis was purely
mathematical;
Eudoxus
did not trouble
himself
about
the
material of the spheres or their mechanical connexion.
The moon has a motion produced by three spheres;
the
first or outermost moves in the same sense as the fixed stars
from
east to west in 24 hours
;
the second moves about an
axis perpendicular to the plane of the
zodiac
circle
or
the
ecliptic, and
in
the
sense
of
the
daily
rotation,
i. e. from
east
to west; the
third again moves about an axis inclined
to the axis of the second at an angle equal
to
the highest
latitude
attained
by. the
moon,
and
from
west
to
east;
the moon
is fixed on the equator of this third sphere.
The
speed of the revolution of the second sphere was very slow
(a
revolution was completed
in a period of 223 lunations);
the third sphere produced the revolution of the moon from
west
to
east
in the draconitic or nodal month
(of 27
days,
5
hours,
5 minutes,
36
seconds) round
a
circle
inclined
to
the
ecliptic at an angle equal to the greatest latitude of the
moon.i
The moon
described
the
latter
circle, while
the
circle
itself was
carried
round
by
the
second
sphere
in
a
retrograde
sense
along
the
ecliptic
in
a
period
of
223
lunations; and both
the
inner
spheres were bodily carried
round by the first sphere in 24 hours in the sense of the daily
rotation.
The three spheres thus produced the motion of the
moon in an orbit inclined to the ecliptic, and the retrogression
of the nodes, completed in a period of about 18^ years.
' Simplicius (and presumably Aristotle also) confused the motions of
the
second
and
third
spheres.
The
above
account
represents what
Eudoxus evidently intended.

332
FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
The system of three spheres for the sun was similar, except
that the orbit was less inclined to the ecliptic than that of the
moon, and the second sphere moved from west to east instead
of from east to west, so that the nodes moved slowly forward
in the direct order of the signs instead of backward.
But the case
to which the greatest mathematical
interest
attaches
is that of the
planets, the motion
of which
is pro-
duced by sets of four spheres for each.
Of each set the
first
and outermost produced the daily rotation in 24 hours
; the
second, the motion round the zodiac in periods which in the
case of superior planets are equal to the sidereal periods of
revolution,
and
for
Mercury
and
Venus
(on
a
geocentric
system) one year.
The third sphere had its poles fixed at two
opposite points on the zodiac
circle, the poles being carried
round
in
the motion
of the
second sphere;
the
revolution
of the third sphere about
its poles was again uniform and
was completed in the synodic period of the planet or the time
which elapsed between two successive oppositions or conjunc-
tions with the sun.
The poles of the third sphere were the
same for Mercury and Venus but
different for all the other
planets.
On the surface of the third sphere the poles of the
fourth sphere were fixed, the axis of the latter being inclined
to that of the former at an angle which was constant for each
planet but different for the different planets.
The rotation of
the fourth sphere about
its axis took place in the same time
as the rotation of the third about its axis but in the opposite
sense.
On the equator of the fourth sphere the planet was
fixed.
Consider now the actual path of a planet subject to
the rotations of the third and fourth spheres only, leaving out
of account for the moment the first two spheres the motion of
which produces the daily rotation and the motion along the
zodiac respectively.
The problem is the following.
A sphere
rotates uniformly about the
fixed diameter AB.
P, P' are
two opposite poles on
this sphere, and a second sphere con-
centric with
the
first rotates uniformly about the diameter
PP' in the same time as the former sphere rotates about AB,
but
in the opposite
direction,
ilf
is a point on the second
sphere
equidistant from
P,
P',
i.e. a point on the equator
of
the
second
sphere.

path

with
spherical
trigonometry and
analytical geometry
;
but
Schiaparelli showed, by means of a series of seven propositions
or problems involving only elementary geometry, that it was
well within the powers of such a geometer as Eudoxus.
The
path
of
31 in space
turns
out
in
fact
to be
a curve
like
a lemniscate or figure-of-eight described on the surface of a
sphere, namely the fixed sphere about AB &s diameter.
This
' spherical lemniscate
'
is roughly shown in the second figure
above.
The curve
is actually the intersection of the sphere
with a certain cylinder touching
it internally at the double
point 0, namely a cylinder with diameter equal
to AS the
sagitta (shown
in the other
figure)
of
the diameter of the
sm^iU
circle
on
which P
revolves.
But
the curve
is
also
the
intersection
of
either
the sphere
or
the
cylinder with
a certain cone with vertex
0, axis parallel to the axis of the
cylinder
(i. e. touching the circle AOB at 0) and vertical angle
equal to the
' inclination
' (the angle AO'F in the first figure).
That this represents the actual result obtained by Eudoxus
himself
is
conclusively proved by
the
facts
that Eudoxus
called
the
curve described by the
planet about the zodiac
circle the hippopede or horse-fetter, and that the same term
hippopede is used by Proclus to describe the plane curve of
similar shape formed by a plane section of an anchor-ring or
tore touching the tore internally and parallel to its axis.^
So far account has only been taken of the motion due to
the combination
of
the
rotations
of
the
third and
fourth
1 Proclus on Eucl. I, p. 112. 5.

334
FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
spheres.
But A, B, the poles of the third sphere, are carried
round
the
zodiac
or
ecliptic by the motion
of
the second
sphere in a time equal to the
' zodiacal
' period of the planet.
Now the axis of symmetry of the
' spherical lemniscate
' (the
arc of the great circle bisecting it longitudinally) always lies
on the
ecliptic.
We may therefore substitute for the third
and
fourth
spheres
the
' lemniscate
' moving
bodily round
the ecliptic.
The combination of the two motions (that of the
' lemniscate
' and that of the planet on it) gives the motion of
the planet through the
constellations.
The motion
of
the
planet round the curve is an oscillatory motion, now forward in
acceleration of the motion round the ecliptic due to the motion
of the second sphere, now backward in retardation of the same
motion
; the period of the oscillation is the period of the syno-
dic revolution, and
the
acceleration and
retardation occupy
half the
period
respectively.
When
the retardation in the
sense of longitude due to the backward oscillation
is greater
than the speed of the forward motion of the lemniscate itself,
the planet will
for a time have a retrograde motion, at the
beginning and end of which it will appear stationary for a little
while, when the two opposite motions balance each other.
It
will be admitted
that
to produce
the
reti'Ogradations
in
this
theoretical way by superimposed
axial rotations
of
spheres was a remarkable stroke of genius.
It was no slight
geometrical achievement, for those days, to demonstrate the
effect
of the hypotheses;
but this
is nothing in comparison
with the speculative power which enabled the man to invent
the hypothesis which would produce the
effect.
It was,
of
course, a much greater achievement than that of Eudoxus's
teacher Archytas
in finding the two mean proportionals by
means of the intersection
of three surfaces in
space, a
tore
with internal diameter nil, a cylinder and a cone
; the problem
solved by Eudoxus was much more
difficult, and yet there
is
the
curious resemblance between
the two
solutions that
Eudoxus's MpiDopede is actually the section of a sphere with
a
cylinder
touching
it
internally and
also with
a
certain
cone; the two
cases together show the freedom with which
master and pupil were accustomed to work with
fio-ures in
three dimensions, and in particular with surfaces of revolution,
their intersections, &c.

THEORY OF CONCENTRIC SPHERES
335
Callippus (about 370-300
B.C.) tried to make the system of
concentric spheres suit the phenomena more exactly by adding
other spheres; he
left the number of the spheres at four in
the case of Jupiter and Saturn, but added one each
to the
other planets and two each
in the case of the sun and moon
(making five in all).
This would substitute for the hippopede
a
still more complicated elongated
figure, and the matter
is
not one to be followed out here.
Aristotle modified the system
in a mechanical sense by
introducing between
each planet
and the one below it reacting spheres one less in number than
those acting on the former planet, and with motions
equal
and opposite to each of them, except the outermost, respec-
tively
; by neutralizing the motions of all except the outermost
sphere acting on any planet he wished to enable that outer-
most to be the outermost acting on the planet below, so that
the spheres became one connected system, each being in actual
contact with the one below and acting on
it, whereas with
Eudoxus
and
Callippus
the spheres
acting on each
planet
formed a separate set independent of the others.
Aristotle's
modification
was
not an improvement, and has no mathe-
matical
interest.
The works of Aristotle are of the greatest importance to
the history of mathematics and particularly of the Elements.
His
date (384-322/1) comes just
before that of Euclid,
so
that from the
difierences between
his statement
of
things
corresponding to what we find in Euclid and Euclid's own we
can draw a fair inference as to the innovations which were
due to Euclid himself.
Aristotle was no doubt a competent
mathematician, though he does not seem to have specialized
in mathematics, and fortunately for us he was fond of mathe-
matical illustrations.
His allusions to particular
definitions,
propositions, &c., in geometry are in such a form as to suggest
that his pupils must have had at hand some text-book where
they could find the things he mentions.
The particular text-
book then
in use would presumably be that which was the
immediate
predecessor
of
Euclid's, namely the Elements of
Theudius;
for
Theudius
is
the
latest
of
pre-Euclidean
geometers whom the summary of Proelus mentions as a com-
piler of Elements.^
' Proelus on Euol.
I, p. 67. 12-16.

336
FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
The mathematics in Aristotle comes under the
following heads.
(a)
First 'pri'nciples.
On no part of the subject does Aristotle throw more light
than
on
the
first
principles
as
then
accepted.
The most
important
passages
dealing
with
this
subject
are
in
the
Postenor Analytka}
While he speaks generally of 'demon-
strative
sciences', his
illustrations are mainly mathematical,
doubtless because they were readiest to his hand.
He gives
the clearest distinctions between axioms (which are common
to
all
sciences), definitions, hypotheses and postulates (which
are
different
for
different
sciences
since they
relate
to
the
subject-matter of the particular science).
If we exclude from
Euclid's axioms
(1) the assumption
that two
straight
lines
cannot
enclose
a
space, which
is
interpolated, and
(2)
the
so-called
' Parallel-Axiom
' which
is the 5th
Postulate, Aris-
totle's
explanation
of
these terms
fits
the
classification
of
Euclid
quite
well.
Aristotle
calls the
axioms by
various
terms,
' common (things) ',
' common axioms ', 'common opinions ',
and this seems to be the origin of
' common notions
' (Koival
evvoiai), the term by which they are
described in the text
of Euclid
; the particular axiom which Aristotle
is most fond
of quoting is No.
3, stating that, if equals be subtracted from
equals, the remainders are equal.
Aristotle does not give any
instance of a geometrical postulate.
From this we may fairly
make the important inference that Euclid's Postulates are all
his own, the momentous Postulate
5
as well
as Nos.
1,
2,
3
relating to constructions of lines and
circles, and No. 4 that
all right angles are equal.
These postulates as well as those
which Archimedes lajs down
at the beginning
of
his book
On Plane Equilibriums
(e.g. that 'equal weights balance at
equal
lengths, but equal weights at unequal lengths do not
balance but
incline
in the direction of the weight which
is
at the greater length ') correspond exactly enough to Aristotle's
idea
of
a
postulate.
This
is
something
which,
e.g.,
the
geometer assumes
(for
reasons known
to
himself)
without
demonstration (though properly a subject for demonstration)
1 Anal. Post.

ARISTOTLE
337
and without any assent on the part
of the
learner, or even
against his opinion rather than otherwise.
As regards defini-
tions, Aristotle
is
clear that they do not assert existence or
non-existence
; they only require to be understood.
Tlie only
exception he makes
is in the case of the unit or monad and
tnagnitucle, the existence of which has to be assumed, while
the existence of everything else has to be proved
; the things
actually necessary to be assumed in geometry are points and
lines only; everything constructed out of them, e.g. triangles,
squares,
tangents, and
their
properties,
e.g. incommensura-
bility, has
to be proved
to
exist.
This again
agrees
sub-
stantially with
Euclid's
procedure.
Actual
construction
is
with him the proof of existence.
If triangles other than the
equilateral triangle constructed in I.
1 are assumed in I. 4-21,
it is only provisionally, pending the construction of a triangle
out of three straight lines in I. 22
; the drawing and producing
of straight
lines and
the describing of
circles
is
postulated
(Postulates
1-3).
Another
interesting
statement
on
the
philosophical side of geometry has reference to the geometer's
hypotheses.
It
is
untrue,
says
Aristotle,
to
assert
that
a
geometer's hypotheses are false because he assumes that a line
which he has drawn
is a foot long when
it is not, or straight
when it is not straight.
The geometer bases no conclusion on
the particular line being that which he has assumed
it to be
;
he
argues about what
it
represents,
the
figure
itself being
a mere illustration.^
Coming now to the
first definitions of Euclid, Book
I, we
find that Aristotle has the equivalents of Defs. 1-3 and 5,
6.
But
for
a
straight
line
he
gives
Plato's
definition
only:
whence we
may
fairly
conclude
that
Euclid's
definition
was
his own,
as
also was
his
definition
of a
plane which
he adapted from that of a straight
line.
Some terms seem
to have been defined in Aristotle's time which Euclid leaves
undefined, e. g. KeK\da6ai,
' to be inflected
', uevew, to
' verge '.^
Aristotle seems to have known Eudoxus's new theory of pro-
portion,
and
he
uses

considerable

Indications of proofs
differing from
Euclid's.
Coming
to
theorems, we
find
in
Aristotle
indications
of
â€¢proofs
differing
entirely
from
those
of
Euclid.
The most
remarkable
case
is
that
of
the theorem
of
I.
5.
For
the
purpose of illustrating the statement that
in any syllogism
one
of
the
propositions must be
affirmative and
universal
he gives a proof of the proposition as follows.^
' For let A, B be drawn
[i. e. joined] to the centre.
'If then we assumed
(1)
that the
angle AG
[i.e. A + C]
is
equal
to
the
angle BD
[i.e. B + B]
without
asserting
generally that the angles of semicircles are equcd, and again
(2)
that
the
angle C
is
equal
to
the
angle D without
making
the
further
assumption
that
the
two
angles
of
all
segments
are
equal,
and
if we
then
inferred,
lastly,
that
since
the
whole
angles
are
equal, and equal angles are
subtracted from them, the angles which
remain, namely E, F, are equal, without
assuming
generally
that,
if
equals
be
subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal, we should
commit a petitio principii.'
There are obvious peculiarities of notation in this extract
the angles are indicated by single
letters, and sums
of two
angles by two
letters in juxtaposition
(cf. BE for B + E in
the
proof
cited from
Archytas above,
p.
215).
The
angles
A, B are the angles at ^, i? of the isosceles triangle OAB, the
same angles as are afterwards spoken of as E, F.
But the
difTerences of substance between this and
Euclid's proof are
much more
striking.
First,
it
is
clear that
' mixed
'
angles
(' angles
' foi'med by straight lines with circular arcs) played
a much
larger
part
in
earlier
text-books than they do
in
Euclid, where indeed they only appear once or twice
as a
survival.
Secondly,
it
is remarkable
that
the
equality
of
the two
' angles
' of a semicircle and of the two
' angles
' of any
segment
is assumed as a means of proving a proposition
so
1 Anal. Prior,
i. 24. 41 b 13-22.

ARISTOTLE
339
elementary as
I.
5, although one would say that the assump-
tions ax'e no more obvious than the proposition to be proved
;
indeed
some
kind
of
proof,
e. g.
by
superposition,
would
doubtless be considered necessary to justify the assumptions.
It
is a natural inference that Euclid's proof of
I. 5 was his
own, and
it would appear
that
his
innovations as
regards
order of propositions and methods of proof began at the very
threshold of the subject.
There are two passages ^ in Aristotle bearing on the theory
of parallels which seem
to show that the theorems of
EÂ«cl.
I. 27, 28 are pre- Euclidean
; but another passage^ appears to
indicate that there was some
vicious circle in the theory of
parallels then current, for Aristotle alludes to a petitio prin-
cipii committed by
' those who think that they draw parallels
(or
' establish
the
theory
of
parallels
',
ras
napaXXrjXovi
ypa.<pnv), and, as I have tried to show
elsewhere,"* a note of
Philoponus makes
it
possible
that
Aristotle
is
criticizing a
direction-ih.&OYy
of
parallels
such
as
has
been
adopted
so
often in modern text-books.
It would seem, therefore, to have
been Euclid who first got rid of the petitio principii in earlier
text-books by formulating the famous Postulate 5 and basing
I. 29 upon it.
A difference of method
is again indicated in regard to the
theorem of Eucl. III. 3 1 that the angle in a semicircle is right.
Two passages of Aristotle taken together* show that before
Euclid the proposition was proved by means
of
the radius
drawn
to
the middle
point of
the
arc of the
semicircle.
Joining
the
extremity of this radius to the ex-
tremities
of
the
diameter
respec-
tively, we have two isosceles right-
angled triangles, and the two angles,
one in each triangle, which are at the middle point of the arc,
being both of them halves of right angles, make the angle in
the semicircle at that point a right
angle.
The proof of the
theorem must have been completed by means of the theorem

FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
of III. 2 1 that angles in the same segment are equal, a proposi-
tion which Euclid's more general proof does not need to use.
These instances are sufficient to show that Euclid was far
from taking four complete Books out of an earlier text-book
without change
;
his
changes began at the very beginning,
and there are probably few, if any, groups of propositions
in
which he did not introduce some impiovements of arrange-
ment or method.
It
is
unnecessary
to
go
into
further
detail
regarding
Euclidean
theorems
found
in
Aristotle except
to
note
the
interesting
fact
that
Aristotle
already
has the
principle of
the method of exhaustion used by Eudoxus
:
' If I continually
add
to
a
finite
magnitude,
I
shall
exceed
every
assigned
â€¢(' defined
', mpuT/j.evov) magnitude, and similarly, if
I subtract,
I shall fall short (of any assigned magnitude).'
(y)
Propositions not found in Euclid.
Some
propositions
found
in
Aristotle but
not
in
Euclid
should be mentioned.
(1) The exterior angles of any polygon
are together
equal
to four right angles^;
although omitted
in Euclid and supplied by Proclus, this is evidently a Pytha-
gorean
proposition.
(2) The
locus
of
a
point such that
its
distances from two given
points are
in a given
ratio
(not
being a
ratio
of equality)
is a circle ^
;
this
is a proposition
quoted by Eutocius from
Apollonius's Plane
Loci,
but
the
proof
given
by
Aristotle
differs
very
little
from
that
of
Apollonius as reproduced by Eutocius, which shows that the
proposition was fully known and a standard proof of it was in
existence before Euclid's time.
(3) Of all closed lines starting
from a
point,
returning
to
it again, and including a given
area, the circumference of a circle is the shortest *
;
this shows
that the study of isoperimetry (comparison of the perimeters
of different figures having the same area) began long before
the date of Zenodorus's treatise quoted by Pappus and Theon
of Alexandria.
(4) Only two solids can fill up space, namely
the pyramid and the cube
'^
;
this
is the complement of the
Pythagorean statement that the only three figures which can

Curves and solids knoivn
to
Aristotle.
There
is little beyond elementary plane geometry in Aris-
totle.
He has the distinction between straight and
' curved
lines
{Ka/j.TrvXai
ypafj.jxai),
but
the
only
curve
mentioned
specifically,
besides
circles,
seems
to
be
the
spiral
^
;
this
term may have no more than the vague sense which
it has
in
the
expression
' the
spirals
. of the heaven
' ^
;
if
it really
means the cylindrical helix, Aristotle does not seem to have
realized its property, for he includes it among things which
are not such
that
' any part
will
coincide
with any
other
part ', whereas ApoUonius
later proved
that the cylindrical
helix has precisely this property.
In solid geometry he distinguishes clearly the three dimen-
sions belonging to
' body
', and, in addition to parallelepipedal
solids, such as
cubes, he
is familiar with spheres, cones and
cylinders.
A sphere he defines as the figure which has all its
radii
(' lines'from the centre ') equal,^ from which we may infer
that Euclid's definition of it as the solid generated by the revo-
lution of a semicircle about its diameter is his own (Eucl. XI,
Def.
14).
Referring
to a
cone, he says* 'the straight
lines
thrown out from K in the form of a cone make GK as a sort
of axis
(Sa-nep
d^ova)', showing
that the
use
of the word
' axis
' was not yet quite technical
;
of conic sections he does
not seem to have had any knowledge, although he must have
been contemporary with Menaechmus.
When he alludes to
' two cubes
being a cube
' he is not
speaking, as one might
suppose, of the duplication of the cube, for he
is saying that
no
science
is
concerned
to
prove anything outside
its own
subject-matter
; thus geom-etry is not required to prove
' that
two cubes are a
cube'*^; hence the sense
of this expression
must be not geometrical but arithmetical, meaning that the
product of two cube numbers
is also a cube number.
In the
Aristotelian Problems there is a question which, although not
mathematical in intention,
is perhaps the
first suggestion of

FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
a certain class of investigation.
If a book in the form of a
cylindrical roll is cut by a plane and then unrolled, why is
it
that
the
cut edge appears as
a
straight
line
if the
section
is parallel to the base
(i. e. is a right section), but as a crooked
line
if
the
section
is obliquely inclined
(to the
axis).i
The
Problems are not by Aristotle;
but, whether
this one
goes
back to Aristotle or not, it is unlikely that he would think of
investigating the form of the curve mathematically.
(e)
The continuous and the
infinite.
Much
light was thrown by
Aristotle on
certain
general
conceptions entering into mathematics such as the
' continuous
and
the
' infinite
'.
The
continuous, he
held,
could
not
be
made up of indivisible parts; the continuous
is that in which
the boundary or limit between two consecutive
parts, where
they
touch,
is one and
the
same, and which,
as the name
itself
implies,
is
/cepi
together, which
is
not
possible
if
the
extremities
are
two
and
not
one.-
The
' infinite
'
or
' un-
limited
' only exists potentially, not in actuality.
The infinite
is
so in virtue of its endlessly changing into something else,
like day or the Oljmipic games, and is manifested in difierent
forms, e.g. in time, in Man, and in the division of magnitudes.
For, in general, the
infinite consists in something new being
continually taken, that something being
itself always
finite
but always
different.
There
is
this distinction between the
forms above mentioned that, whereas in the case of magnitudes
what
is once taken remains, in the case of time and Man
it
passes or is destroyed, but the succession
is unbroken.
The
case of addition
is
in a sense the same as that of division
;
in the finite magnitude the former takes place in the converse
way to the latter
;
for, as we see the finite magnitude divided
ad infinitum,
so we
shall
find
that
addition
gives a sum
tending
to
a
definite
limit.
Thus,
in
the
case
of
a
finite
magnitude, ypu may take a definite fraction of
it and add to
it continually in the same ratio
;
if now the successive added
terms do not include one and the same magnitude, whatever
it
is
[i. e.
if
the
successive
terms diminish
in
geometrical
progression], you
will
not
come
to
the
end
of
the
finite
magnitude,
but,
if
the
ratio
is increased so that each terra

ARISTOTLE ON THE INFINITE
343
Â«does include one and the same magnitude, whatever it is, you
will come to the end of the
finite magnitude, for every finite
magnitude
is exhausted by
continually
taking from
it any
definite fraction whatever.
In no other sense does the infinite
exist but only in the sense just mentioned, that is, potentially
and by way of diminution.^
And in this sense you may have
potentially infinite addition, the process being, as we say, in
a manner the same as with division ad injinitwm
; for in the
case
of addition you
will always be able
to find something
outside the total
for the time being, but the total will never
exceed every definite (or assigned) magnitude in the way that,
in the direction of division, the result will pass every definite
magnitude, that
is, by becoming smaller than it.
The infinite
therefore cannot exist, even potentially, in the sense of exceed-
ing every finite magnitude as the result of successive addition.
It follows that the correct view of the infinite is the opposite
of
that commonly
held;
it
is
not that which has nothing
outside
it, but that which always' has something outside
it.^
Aristotle is aware that it is essentially of physical magnitudes
that he
is speaking:
it
is, he
says, perhaps a more
general
inquiry that would be necessary
to
determine whether the
infinite
is
possible
in
mathematics and
in
the
domain
of
thought and of things which have no magnitude.^
' But
',
he
says,
' my
argument
does
not
anyhow
rob
mathematicians of their study, although it denies the existence
of the infinite in the sense of actual existence as something
increased to such an extent that
it cannot be gone through
{d8if^LTr]Tov)
;
for, as
it
is, they do not even need the infinite
or use
it, but only require that the finite (straight
line)
shall
be as long as they please.
.
.
. Hence it will make no difierence
to them for the purpose of demonstration.' *
The above
disquisition about the
infinite should, I think,
be interesting to mathematicians
for the
distinct expression
of Aristotle's view that the existence of an
infinite series the
terms
of which
are
magnitudes
is
impossible
unless
it
is
convergent and
(with reference
to Riemann's developments)
that it does not matter to geometry if the straight line is not
'nfiaite
in length
provided
that
it
is as long as we
please.

FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
Aristotle's
denial
of even the potential
existence
of
a sum
of magnitudes which
shall exceed every
definite magnitude
was,
as he
himself
implies, inconsistent with the lemma or
assumption
used by Eudoxus
in
his method of exhaustion.
We
can,
therefore,
well
understand
whj^
a
century
later,
Archimedes
felt
it
necessary
to justify
his own use
of the
lemma
:
' the earlier geometers too have used this lemma
:
for
it is by
its help that they have proved that circles have to one another
the
duplicate
ratio of their diameters, that spheres have to
one another the triplicate ratio of their diameters, and so on.
And, in the result, each of the said theorems has been accepted
no less than those proved without the aid of this lemma.'

Mechanics.
An account of the mathematics in Aristotle would be incom-
plete without a reference to his ideas in mechanics, where he
laid down
principles
which,
even though
partly
erroneous,
held
their ground
till the time
of Benedetti
(1530-90)
and
Galilei
(1564-1642).
The
Mechanica
included in
the
Aris-
totelian writings
is not indeed Aristotle's own work, but it is
veiy close in date, as we may conclude from its terminology
;
this shows more general agreement with the terminology of
Euclid than
is found in Aristotle's own writings, but certain
divergences from Euclid's terms are common to the latter and
to
the Mechanica
;
the
conclusion from which
is
that the
Mechaniccc was written before Euclid had made the termino-
logy of mathematics more uniform and convenient, or, in the
alternative, that it was composed after Euclid's time by persons
who, though they had partly assimilated Euclid's terminology,
were
close enough
to
Aristotle's
date to be
still
influenced
by
his usage.
But the
Aristotelian origin of many of
the
ideas
in
the Mechanica
is proved by
their
occurrence
in
Aristotle's genuine writings.
Take, for example, the principle
of the lever.
In the Mechanica we are told that,
' as the
weight moved
is
to the moving
weight,
so
is the
length (or distance) to the length inversely.
In fact the mov-
ing weight will more easily move (the system) the farther
it
is away from
the
fulcrum.
The
reason
is
that
aforesaid,
' Archimedes, Quadrature of a Parabola, Preface.

ARISTOTELIAN MECHANICS
345
namely that the line which is farther from the centre describes
the greater
circle, so
that,
if the power applied
is the same,
that which moves
(the system)
will change
its position the
more, the farther it is away from the fulcrum.' ^
The
idea
then
is
that
the
greater
power
exerted by
the
weight
at
the
greater
distance
corresponds
to
its
greater
velocity.
Compare with
this
the
passage
in
the Be
caelo
where
Aristotle
is speaking
of
the speeds of the
circles
of
the
stars
:
' it is not at all strange, nay it is inevitable, that the speeds of
circles should be in the proportion of their sizes.' ^
.
.
.
' Since
in two concentric circles the segment
(sector) of the outer cut
off between two
radii common to both circles is greater than
that cut off" on the inner, it is reasonable that the greater circle
should be carried round in the same time.' ^
Compare again the passage of the Mechanica
:
' what happens with the balance is reduced to (the case of the)
circle,
the
case
of
the
lever
to
that
of
the
balance, and
practically
everything concerning mechanical movements to
the
case
of
the
lever.
Further
it
is
the
fact
that, given
a
radius of a
circle, no two points of
it move at the same
speed (as the radius itself revolves), but the point more distant
from the centre always moves more quickly, and this
is the
reason
of many remarkable
facts about
the movements
of
circles which will appear in the sequel.' *
The axiom which is regarded as containing the germ of the
principle of virtual velocities is enunciated, in slightly different
forms, in the Be caelo and the Physics
:
' A smaller and lighter weight will be given more movement
if
the force acting on
it
is the same.
.
.
. The speed of the
lesser body will be to that of the greater as the greater body
is to the lesser.' *
'If
J.
be the movent, B
the thing moved, C the
length
through which it is moved, B the time taken, then
A will move ^B over the distance 2 C in the time B,
and A
â€ž_

A will move
B over the distance |C' in the time ^D,
and 1^

1 5
a distance
G
â€ž
â€ž
D;^
and so on.
Lastly, we have
in
the
Mechanica
the parallelogram
of
velocities
:
' When a body is moved in a certain ratio
(i. e. has two linear
movements in a constant ratio to one another), the body must
move in a straight line, and this straight line
is the diameter
of the figure (parallelogram) formed from the
straight lines
which have the given ratio.' ^
The
author goes
on
to
say ^
that,
if
the
ratio
of the two
movements does not remain the same from one instant to the
next, the motion will not be in a straight line but in a curve.
He instances a circle in a vertical plane with a point moving
along
it downwards from the topmost point;
the point has
two simultaneous movements
; one
is in a
vertical
line, the
other displaces
this vertical line parallel to itself away from
the
position
in which
it
passes through
the
centre
till
it
reaches the position of a tangent to the circle
;
if during this
time the ratio of the two movements were constant, say one of
equality, the point would not move along the circumference
at all but along the diagonal of a rectangle.
The
parallelogram
of forces
is
easily deduced from
the
parallelogram
of
velocities combined with Aristotle's axiom
that the force which moves a given weight is directed along
the
line
of the weight's motion and
is proportional
to the
distance described by the weight in a given time.
Nor should we omit to mention the Aristotelian tract On
indivisible
lines.
We have seen
(p. 293)
that, according to
Aristotle, Plato objected to the genus
' point
' as a geometrical
fiction,
calling a
point
the beginning
of a
line, and
often
positing
'indivisible
lines' in the same
sense.*
The idea of
indivisible lines appears to have been only vaguely conceived
by Plato, but it took shape in his school, and with Xenocrates
' Fhys.

THE TRACT ON INDIVISIBLE LINES
347
became a
definite
doctrine.
There
is plenty of evidence for
this ^
;
Proclus, for instance,
tells us of
' a discourse or argu-
ment by Xenocrates introducing indivisible lines '.^
The tract
On indivisible lines was no doubt intended as a counterblast
to Xenocrates.
It can hardly have been written by Aristotle
himself;
it contains,
for instance, some expressions without
parallel in Aristotle.
But
it
is
certainly the work of some
one belonging to the school
; and we can imagine that, having
on some occasion to mention
' indivisible lines
', Aristotle may
well have set to some pupil, as an exercise, the task of refuting
Xenocrates.
According
to
Simplicius
and
Philoponus,
the
tract was
attributed by some
to Theophrastus ^
;
and
this
seems
the
most
likely,
supposition,
especially
as
Diogenes
Laertius mentions,
in a
list of works by Theophrastus,
' On
indivisible
lines, one Book
'.
The
text
is
in many
places
corrupt, so that it is often difficult or impossible to restore the
argument.
In
reading the book we
feel
that the writer
is
for the most
part chopping
logic
rather than
contributing
seriously
to the
philosophy
of mathematics.
The
interest
of the work to the historian of mathematics is of the slightest.
It does indeed cite the equivalent of certain
definitions and
propositions in Euclid, especially Book X (on irrationals), and
in particular it mentions the
irrationals
called
' binomial
' or
' apotome
',
though,
as
far
as
irrationals are concerned,
the
writer may have drawn on Theaetetus rather than
Euclid-
The mathematical phraseology
is
in many places
similar to
that of Euclid, but the writer shows a tendency to hark back
to
older and
less
fixed
terminology
such
as
is
usual
in
Aristotle.
The tract begins with a section stating the argu-
ments for indivisible
lines, which we may take to represent
Xenocrates's own arguments.
The next section purports to
refute
these arguments one by
one, after which other
con-
siderations are urged against indivisible lines.
It is sought to
show that the hypothesis of indivisible lines is not reconcilable
with the
principles
assumed,
or the
conclusions proved,
in
mathematics;
next,
it
is argued
that,
if
a
line
is made up
of indivisible
lines (whether an odd or even number of such
lines), or
if the indivisible line has any point in
it, or points

terminating
it,
the

line must be

;
and,
lastly, various arguments are put forward to show that a line
can no more be made up of points thfin of indivisible lines,
with more about the relation of points to lines, &c.^
Sphaeric.
AuTOLYCDS of Pitane was the teacher of Arcesilaus (about
315-241/40 B.C.), also of
Pitane, the founder of the so-called
Middle Academy.
He may be taken to have flourished about
310
B.C.
or
a
little
earlier,
so
that
he was an
elder con-
temporary
of
Euclid.
We hear
of him
in connexion with
Eudoxus's theory of concentric spheres, to which he adhered.
The great difficulty in the way of this theory was early seen,
namely the impossibility of reconciling the assumption of the
invariability of the distance of each planet with the observed
differences
in
the
brightness, especially of Mars and Venus,
at different times, and the apparent differences in the relative
sizes of the sun and moon.
We are told that no one before
Autolycus had
even
attempted
to
deal with
this
difficulty
' by means of hypotheses
',
i. e. (presumably) in a theoretical
manner, and even he was not successful, as clearly appeared
from his controversy with Aristotherus ^ (who was the teacher
of Aratus)
;
this implies
that
Autolycus's argument was
in
a written
treatise.
Two works by Autolycus have come down
to
us.
They
both deal with the geometry of the sphere in its application
to astronomy.
The
definite place
which they
held among
Greek astronomical text-books
is attested by the fact that, as
we gather from Pappus, one
of
them,
the
treatise On
the
â€¢moving Sphere, was
included
in
the
list
of works forming
the
' Little Astronomy
', as it was called afterwards, to distin-
guish
it from the 'Great
Collection'
(fieydXri
awTa^Ls)
of
Ptolemy
; and we may doubtless assume that the other work
On Risings ami Settings was similarly included.
' A revised text of the work is included in Aristotle, De plantis, edited
by 0. Apelt, who
also gave a G-erman translation of
it in Beitnlge siir
Geschichte der griechischen Philosophie (1891), pp. 271-86.
A translation
by H.
H. Joachim has
since appeared (1908) in the
series of Oxford
Translations of Aristotle's works.
^ Simplicius on De caelo, p. 504. 22-5 Heib.

AUTOLYCUS OF PITANE
349
Both works have been well edited by Hultsch with Latin
translation.^
They are of great interest for several
reasons.
First, Autolycus
is
the
earliest Greek mathematician from
whom original treatises have come down to us entire, the next
being
Euclid,
Aristarchus and
Archimedes.
That he wrote
earlier than Euclid
is clear from the fact that Euclid, in his
similar work,
the Phaenomena, makes
use
of
propositions
appearing in Autolycus, though, as usual in such cases, giving
no indication of their source.
The form of Autolycus's proposi-
tions
is exactly the same as that with which we are familiar
in Euclid
; we have first the enunciation of the proposition in
general terms, then the particular enunciation with reference
to a figure with letters marking the various points in
it, then
the demonstration, and lastly, in some cases but not in all, the
conclusion in terms similar to those of the enunciation.
This
shows that Greek geometrical propositions had already taken
the form which we recognize as classical, and that Euclid did
not invent this form or introduce any material changes.
A lost text-book on Sphaeric.
More important
still
is the fact that Autolycus, as well as
Euclid, makes use of a number of propositions relating to the
sphere without giving any proof
of them
or
quoting any
authority.
This indicates that there was already in existence
in
his time a text-book of the elementary geometry of the
sphere, the propositions
of which were generally known
to
mathematicians.
As many of these propositions are proved
in the Sphaerica of Theodosius, a work compiled two or three
centuries later, we may assume that the lost text-book proceeded
on much the same lines as that of Theodosius, with much the
same
order
of
propositions.
Like
Theodosius's
Sphaerica
it
treated
of the
stationary
sphere,
its
sections
(great and
small
circles) and
their
properties.
The
geometry
of
the
sphere
at
rest
is of course prior to the consideration of the
sphere in motion,
i. e. the sphere rotating about its axis, which
is the subject of Autolycus's works.
Who was the author of
the
lost
pre-Euclidean
text-book

FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
Tannery thought that we could hardly help attributing it to
Eudoxus.
The
suggestion
is
natural,
seeing
that Eudoxus
showed, in his theory of concentric spheres, an extraordinary
mastery of the geometry
of the sphere
; on the other hand,
as
Loria
observes,
it
is,
speaking
generally, dangerous
to
assume
that a work
of an unknown author
appearing
in
a certain country at a certain time must have been written
by a particular man of science simply because he is the only
man of the time of whom we can certainly say that he was
capable of wi-iting it.^
The works of Autolycus also serve to
confirm the pre-Euclidean origin of a number of propositions
in the Elements.
Hultseh ^ examined this question in detail
in
a
paper
of
1886.
There
are
(1)
the
propositions
pre-
supposed in one or other of Autolycus's theorems.
We have
also to take account of
(2) the propositions which would be
required to establish the propositions in sphaeric assumed by
Autolycus as known.
The best clue to the propositions under
(2)
is the
actual
course
of
the proofs
of
the corresponding
propositions
in the Sjjhaerica of Theodosius;
for Theodosius
was
only a
compiler, and we may with
great
probability
assume that, where Theodosius uses propositions from Euclid's
Elements, propositions
corresponding
to them were used
to
prove
the
analogous
propositions
in
the
fourth-century
Sphaeric.
The propositions
which, following
this
criterion,
we may suppose to have been directly used for
this purpose
are, roughly, those represented by Eucl.

When, however, Hultseh increased the

propositions by adding
the whole chain of propositions
(in-
cluding Postulate

ment, he took an unsafe course, because
it

AUTOLYCUS AND EUCLID
351
The work On
the moving
Spher6
assumes
abstractly a
sphere moving about the axis stretching from
pole
to
pole,
and different series of circular sections, the
first series being
great
circles
passing
through
the
poles,
the
second
small
circles
(as
well
as
the
equator) which
are
sections
of
the
sphere by planes at right angles
to the axis and are called
the
'parallel
circles',
while the third kind are great
circles
inclined obliquely
to
the
axis of the sphere;
the motion of
points
(Jn these
circles
is then considered
in relation to the
section by
a
fixed
plane through
the centre of the
sphere.
It is easy to recognize in the oblique great circle in the sphere
the
ecliptic or zodiac
circle, and in the section made by the
fixed
plane
the
horizon, which
is
described
as
the
circle
in
the
sphere 'which
defines
{opi^wv)
the
visible
and
the
invisible
portions
of
the
sphere'.
To
give an
idea
of
the
content
of the work,
I
will quote a few enunciations from
Autolycus and
along with
two
of
them,
for
the
sake
of
comparison with Euclid, the corresponding enunciations from
the Phaenomena.
Autolycus.
1.
If a sphere revolve uni-
formly about its own axis, all
the points on the surface of the
sphere which are not on the
axis
will
describe
parallel
circles which have the same
poles
as
the
sphere and
are
also at right angles to the axis.
Euclid.
7.
If the circle in the sphere
defining the
visible and
the
invisible portions of the sphere
be
obliquely
inclined
to
the
axis, the circles which are at
right angles to the axis and cut
the defining
circle
[horizon]
always make both their risings
and settings at the same points
of the defining circle [horizon]
and further will also be simi-
larly inclined to that circle.
3. The
circles which are at
right angles
to the
axis and
cut
the
horizon make
both
their
risings and
settings
at
the same points of the horizon.

352
FROM PLATO TO EUCLID
7.
That
the
circle
of
the
zodiac rises and sets over the
whole extent
of
the
horizon
between the tropics
is mani-
fest, forasmuch as
it touches
circles
greater
than
those
which the horizon touches.
Autolycus.
Euclid.
9.
If
in a sphere
a great
circle which
is
obliquely
in-
clined
to the axis define the
visible and the invisible por-
tions
of the sphere, then, of
the
points which
rise
at the
same time, those towards the
visible
pole
set later and,
of
those which
set at the same
time, those towards the visible
pole rise earlier.
11.
If in a sphere a great
circle which
is
obliquely
in-
clined
to the axis
define the
visible and the invisible por-
tions of the sphere, and any
other
oblique
great
circle
touch greater (parallel) circles
tlian
those which the
defin-
ing
circle
(horizon)
touches,
the
said
other oblique
circle
makes its risings and settings
over the whole extent of the
circumference (arc) of the de-
fining circle included between
the
parallel
circles which
it
touches.
It will
be noticed that Autolycus's propositions are more
abstract in
so far as the
' other oblique circle
' in Autolycus
is any
other
oblique
circle, whereas
in Euclid
it
definitely
becomes the zodiac circle.
In Euclid
' the great circle defining
the visible and the invisible portions of the sphere
' is already
shortened into the technical term
' horizon
' {opi^mv), which is
defined
as
if
for the
first time
:
' Let the name horizon be
given to the plane through us (as observers) passing through
the universe and separating ofi" the hemisphere which is visible
above the earth.'
The book On Risings and Settings is of astronomical interest
only, and belongs to the region of Phaenomena as understood
by Eudoxus and Aratus,
that
is,
observational
astronomy.
It begins with definitions distinguishing between
' true
' and

AUTOLYCUS ON RISINGS AND SETTINGS
353
' apparent
' morning- and evening-risings and settings of fixed
stars.
The
' true
' morning-rising
(setting)
is when the
star
rises
(sets)
at
the moment
of
the
sun's
rising
;
the
' true
morning-rising (setting)
is, therefore invisible to
us, and so is
the
' true
' evening-rising
(setting) which takes place at the
moment when the sun
is setting.
The 'apparent' morning-
rising (setting) takes place when the star
is
first seen rising
(setting)
before the sun
rises, and the
' apparent
'
evening-
rising (setting) when the star is last seen rising (setting) after
the sun has set.
The following are the enunciations of a few
of the propositions in the treatise.
I.
1. In
the
case
of each
of the fixed
stars the apparent
morning-risings
and
settings
are
later than
the
true,
and
the
apparent
evening-risings and
settings
are
earlier
than
the
true.
I. 2. Each of the fixed stars
is seen rising each night from
the
(time of
its) apparent morning-rising to the time of
its
apparent evening-rising but at no other period, and the time
during which the star is seen rising is less than half a year.
I.
5. In the case of those of the fixed stars which are on the
zodiac
circle,
the
interval from
the time of their apparent
evening-rising to the time of their apparent evening-setting is
half a year, in the case of those north of the
zodiac
circle
more than half a year, and in the case of those south of the
zodiac circle less than half a year.
II.
1. The
twelfth part of the zodiac
circle
in which the
sun
is, is neither seen rising nor setting, but
is hidden
; and
similarly the twelfth part which
is opposite to it
is neither
seen setting nor rising but is visible above the earth the whole
of the nights.
II.
4. Of
the
fixed
stars
those which
are cut
off by the
zodiac circle in the northerly or the southerly direction will
reach their evening-setting at an interval of five months from
their morning-rising.
II.
9. Of the stars which are carried on the same (parallel-)
circle
those which are
cut
off by
the
zodiac
circle
in
the
northerly direction will be hidden a shorter time than those
on the southern side of the zodiac.

XI
EUCLID
Date and
traditions.
We have very few
particulars
of the
lives
of
the
great
mathematicians
of
Greece.
Even
Euclid
is
no
exception.
Practically all that is known about him is contained in a few
sentences of Proclus's summary
:
' Not mucli younger than these (sc. Hermotimus of Colophon
and
Philippus
of Mende
or Medma)
is Euclid, who put
to-
gether the Elements, collecting many of Eudoxus's theorems,
perfecting many, of Theaetetus's, and
also bringing to
irre-
fragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat
loosely proved by his
predecessors.
This man lived in the
time
of
the
first
Ptolemy.
For
Archimedes, who
came
immediately
after
the
first
(Ptolemy), makes
mention
of
Euclid
; and further they say that Ptolemy once asked him
if
there was
in geometry any
shorter way than
that
of
the
Elements, and
he
replied
that
there was
no royal road to
geometry.
He
is then younger than the pupils of Plato, but
older than
Eratosthenes and Archimedes, the
latter having
been contemporaries, as Eratosthenes somewhere says.' ^
This passage shows that even Proclus had no direct know-
ledge of Euclid's, birthplace, or of the dates of his birth and
death
; he can only infer generally at what period he fiourished.
All
that
is
certain
is that
Euclid was
later than
the
first
pupils of Plato and earlier than Archimedes.
As Plato died
in 347 B.C. and Archimedes lived from 28 7 to 212 B.C., Euclid
must have flourished about 300 B.C., a date which agrees well
with the statement that he lived under the first Ptolemy, who
reigned from 306 to 283 B.C.
1 Proclus on Eucl.
I, p. 68. 6-20.

DATE AND TRADITIONS
355
" More
particulars
are,
it
is
true,
furnished
by
Arabian
authors.
We are told that
' Euclid, son
of Naucrates, and grandson
of Zenarchus [the
Fihrist has
' son of Naucrates, the son of Berenice (?) '], called
the author
of geometry, a philosopher of somewhat ancient
date, a Greek by nationality, domiciled at Damascus, born at
Tyre, most
learned
in
the
science
of
geometry, published
a most excellent and most useful work entitled the foundation
or elements of geometry, a subject in which no more general
treatise existed before among the Greeks
: nay, there was no
one even of later date who did not walk in his footsteps and
frankly
profess
his
doctrine.
Hence
also
Greek, Roman,
and Arabian geometers not a few;, who undertook the task of
illustrating this work, published commentaries,
scholia, and
notes upon
it, and made an abridgement of the work
itself.
For this reason the Greek philosophers used to post up on the
doors
of
their
schools the well-known
notice,
" Let no one
come
to our
school, who
has
not
first
learnt the elements
of Euclid".'!
This shows the usual tendency
of
the
Arabs
to romance.
They were
in
the habit
of recording the names
of grand-
fathers, while the Greeks were not
; Damascus and Tyre were
no doubt brought in to gratify the desire which the Arabians
always showed to connect famous Greeks in some way or other
with the east (thus they described Pythagoras as a pupil of the
wise Salomo, and Hipparchus as
' the Chaldaean ').
We recog-
nize the inscription over the doors of the schools of the Greek
philosophers
as
a
variation
of
Plato's
firiSeh
dyeaiJLeTprjTos
elaiTco;
the philosopher has become Greek
philosophers
in
general, the school their schools, while geometry has become
the Elements of Euclid.
The Arabs even explained that the
name of Euclid, which they pronounced variously as Uclides or
Icludes, was compounded of Ucli, a key, and Dis, a measure, or,
as some say, geometry, so that Uclides
is equivalent to the
key of geomett'y
!
In the Middle Ages most translators and editors spoke of
Euclid as Euclid of Megara, confusing our Euclid with Euclid
the philosopher, and the contemporary of Plato,who lived about
400 B.C.
The first trace of the confusion appears in Valerius
'
Casiri,
Bihliotheca Arabico-Hispana Escurialensis,
i,
p. 339
(Casiri's
source is the Ta'rikh al-Hukama of al-Qifti (d. 1248).
A a 2

356
EUCLID
Maximus
(in
the
time
of
Tiberius) who
says ^
that
Plato,
on being appealed to for a solution of the problem of doubling
the cube,
sent the inquirers to
' Euclid the geometer
'.
The
mistake was
seen by
one
Constantinus
Lascaris
(d.
about
1493), and
the
first
translator
to
point
it out
clearly was
Commandinus (in his translation of Euclid published in 1572).
Euclid may have been a Platonist, as Proclus says, though
this
is not
certain.
In any
case,
he
probably received his
mathematical
training
in Athens from the
pupils of
Plato;
most of the geometers who could have taught him were of
that
school.
But he himself taught and founded a
school
at
Alexandria,
as we
learn
from
Pappus's
statement
that
Apollonius
' spent a very long time with the pupils of Euclid
at
Alexandria'.^
Here
again
come
in
our
picturesque
Arabians,^ who made out that the Elements were originally
written by a man whose name was Apollonius, a carpenter,
who wrote the work
in
fifteen books
or sections
(this idea
seems to be based on some misunderstanding of Hypsicles's
preface
to
the
so-called Book XIV
of Euclid), and
that, as
some of
the work was
lost in
course of time and the
rest
disarranged, one
of the kings at Alexandria who desired
to
study geometry and to master this treatise in particular first
questioned about
it certain learned men who visited him, and
then
sent
for
Euclid, who was
at
that
time famous
as a
geometer, and asked him
to
revise and complete the work
and reduce
it to order, upon which Euclid rewrote the work
in thirteen books, thereafter known by his name.
On
the
character of Euclid Pappus has a remark which,
however,
was
probably
influenced
by
his
obvious
aniiQUs
against Apollonius, whose preface to the Conies seemed to him
to give too little credit to Euclid for his earlier work in the same
subject.
Pappus contrasts Euclid's attitude to his predecessors.
Euclid, he says, was no such boaster or controversialist
: thus
he regarded Aristaeus as deserving credit for the discoveries
he had made
in
conies, and made no attempt
to anticipate
him
or
to
construct afresh
the same
system, such was
his
scrupulous fairness and his exemplary kindliness to all who

could
advance
mathematical
science
to
however
small
an
extent.^
Although, as I have indicated, Pappus's motive was
rather
to represent ApoUonius in a relatively unfavourable
light than
to
state a
historical
fact about Euclid, the
state-
ment accords well with what we should gather from Euclid's
own works.
These show no sign of any claim to be original
;
in
the Elements,
for
instance,
although
it
is
clear that he
made great changes, altering the arrangement of whole Books,
redistributing propositions between them, and inventing new
proofs where the new order made the earlier proofs inappli-
cable, it is safe to say that he made no more alterations than
his own acumen and the latest special investigations (such as
Eudoxus's theory of pi'oportion) showed to be imperative in
order
to make
the
exposition
of
the
whole
subject more
scientific than the earlier efforts of writers of elements.
His
respect for tradition
is seen in
his retention of some things
which were out of date and
useless,
e. g. certain
definitions
never afterwards
used,
the
solitary references
to the angle
of a
semicircle
or the angle of a segment, and the
like
; he
wrote no
sort of preface
to his work (would that he had
!)
such as those in which Archimedes and ApoUonius introduced
their treatises and distinguished what they claimed as new in
them from what was already known
: he plunges at once into
his subject,
' A point is that which has no part
!
And what a teacher he must have been
!
One story enables
us to picture him in that capacity.
According to Stobaeus,
'some one who had begun
to read geometry with
Euclid,
when
he had learnt the
first theorem, asked
Euclid, "what
shall I get by learning these things 1 "
Euclid called his sla.ve
and said, " Give him threepence, since he must make gain out
of what he learns ".'

as the author of the Elements.

it appeared, is and will doubtless remain the greatest mathe-
matical
text-book
of
all
time.
Scarcely
any
other
book
except the Bible can have circulated more widely the world
over, or been more edited and studied.
Even in Greek times
the most accomplished mathematicians
occupied themselves
with
it;
Heron, Pappus, Porphyry,
Proclus and
Simplicius
wrote commentaries
;
Theon of Alexandria re-edited
it, alter-
ing
the
language
here and
there,
mostly
with
a
view
to
greater
clearness
and
consistency, and
interpolating
inter-
mediate
steps,
alternative
proofs,
separate
' cases ',
porisms
(corollaries) and lemmas
(the most important addition being
the second part of VI. 33 relating to sectors).
Even the great
Apollonius was moved by Euclid's work to discuss the
first
principles
of geometry
;
his
treatise
on
the
subject was
in
fact a
criticism
of
Euclid, and none
too successful at that
;
some alternative
definitions given by him have point, but his
alternative solutions of some of the easy problems in Book I
do not constitute any improvement, and his attempt to prove
the axioms
(if one may judge by the case quoted by Proclus,
that of Axiom
1) was thoroughly misconceived.
Apart from systematic commentaries on the whole work or
substantial
parts of
it, there were already in
ancient times
discussions and controversies on special subjects dealt with by
Euclid,
and particularly
his theory
of
parallels.
The
fifth
Postulate
was
a
great
stumbling-block.
We
know
from
Aristotle that up to his time the theory of parallels had not
been put on
a
scientific
basis ^
: there was apparently some
'petitio principii lurking in
it.
It seems therefore clear that
Euclid was the first to apply the bold remedy of laying down
the
indispensable
principle of the theory in the form of an
indemonstrable
Postulate.
But geometers were not
satisfied
with -this
solution.
Posidonius and
Geminus
tried
to
get
over the
difficulty by substituting an equidistance theory of
parallels.
Ptolemy actually tried to prove Euclid's postulate,
as also did Proclus, and (according to Simplicius) one Diodorus,
as
well
as
' Aganis
'
;
the attempt
of Ptolemy
is given by
Proclus along with his own, while that of 'Aganis' is repro-
duced
from
Simplicius
by
the
Arabian
commentator
an-
Nairizi.

COMMENTARIES, CRITICISMS & REFERENCES
359
Other very early criticisms there were, directed against the
very
first steps in EucHd's work.
Thus Zeno of Sidon, an
Epicurean, attacked the proposition I.
1 on the ground that it
is not conclusive unless
it be
first assumed that neither two
straight
lines nor two
circumferences
can have
a common
segment
; and this was so far regarded as a serious criticism
that
Posidonius
wrote
a
whole book
to
controvert
Zeno.^
Again,
there
is
the
criticism
of the Epicureans that
I.
20,
proving that any two sides in a triangle are together greater
than
the
third,
is
evident even
to an
ass and requires no
proof.
I mention these isolated
criticisms
to show that the
Elements, although
the}' superseded
all other Elements and
never in ancient times had any rival, were not even
at the
first accepted without question.
The
first
Latin author
to mention Euclid
is Cicero;
but
it
is not
likely that the Elements had then been translated
into
Latin.
Theoretical
geometry
did
not
appeal
to
the
Romans, who only cared for so much of
it as was useful for
measurements and calculations.
Philosophers studied Euclid,
'but probably in the original Greek
; Martianus CapelJa speaks
of the
effect of the mention of the pi'oposition
' how to con-
struct an equilateral triangle on a given straight line
' among
a company
of
philosophers, who, recognizing the
first pro-
position of the Elements, straightway break out into encomiums
on
Euclid.^
Beyond
a fragment in a Verona palimpsest of
a free rendering or rearrangement of some propositions from
Books XII and XIII dating apparently from the fourth century,
we have no trace of any Latin version before Boetius (born
about
A. D. 480), to whom Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus and
Theodoric attribute a
translation
of
Euclid.
The
so-called
geometry of
Boetius which has come down
to us
is by no
means a translation of Euclid
; but even the redaction of this
in two Books which was edited by Friedlejn
is not genuine,
having apparently been put together in the eleventh century
from various sources;
it contains the
definitions of Book
I,
the Postulates (five in number), the Axioms (three only), then
some
definitions
from
Eucl.

represents, on
the
face
of
it, a more
ancient
edition than
Theon's.
It is also clear that the copyist of P (as the manu-
script
is
called
after
Peyrard), or
rather
of
its
archetype,'
had before him the two recensions and
systematically gave
the preference to the earlier one
; for at XIII. 6 in P the first
hand has a marginal note,
' This theorem is not given in most
copies of the neiv edition, but
is found in those of the old'.
The
editio princeps
(Basel, 1533) edited by Simon Grynaeus
was based on two manuscripts (Venetus Marcianus 301 and
Paris, gr. 2343)
of the sixteenth century, which
are among
the
worst.
The
Basel
edition
was
again
the
foundation
of the text of Gregory (Oxford, 1703), who only consulted the

THE TEXT OF THE ELEMENTS
361
manuscripts
bequeathed
by
Savile
to
the
University
in
places where the Basel text
differed from the Latin version
of Commandinus which
he followed
in
the
main.
It was
a
pity
that
even
Peyrard
in
his
edition
(1814-18)
only
corrected the Basel text by means of P, instead of rejecting
it altogether and starting afresh
; but he adopted many of the
readings of P and gave a conspectus of them in an appendix.
E. F. August's edition
(1826-9) followed P more closely, and
he
consulted
the
Viennese
MS.
gr.

also;
but
it
was
left for Heiberg to bring out a new and definitive Greek text
(1883-8) based on P and the best of the Theonine manuscripts,
and taking account
of external
sources such as Heron and
Proclus.
Except in a few passages, Proclus's manuscript does
not seem
to have been of the best, but authors earlier than
Theon, e.g. Heron, generally agree with our best manuscripts.
Heiberg concludes that the Elements were most spoiled by
interpolations about the third century, since Sextus Empiricus
had a correct text, while lamblicus had an interpolated one.
The differences between the inferior Theonine manuscripts
and the best sources are perhaps best illustrated by the arrange-
ment
of
postulates and axioms
in
Book
I.
Our
ordinary
editions based on Simson have
three postulates and twelve
axioms.
Of these twelve axioms the eleventh
(stating that
all right angles are equal)
is, in the genuine
text, the fourth
Postulate, and the twelfth Axiom
(the Parallel-Postulate)
is
the
fifth Postulate
; the
Postulates were thus originally five
in
number.
Of
the
ten
remaining Axioms
or Common
Notions Heron only recognized the
first
three, and Proclus
only these and two others
(that things which
coincide
are
equal, and that the whole is greater than the part);
it is fairly
certain, therefore, that the rest are interpolated, including the
assumption
that two
straight
lines cannot
enclose
a
space
(Euclid himself regarded
this
last
fact as involved in Postu-
late
1, which implies that a
straight
line joining one point
to another is unique).
Latin and Arabic
translations.
The first Latin translations which we possess in a complete
form were made not from the Greek but from
the Arabic.
It was as early as the eighth century that the Elements found

362
EUCLID
their way to Arabia.
The Caliph al-Mansur (754-75), as the
result of a mission to the Byzantine Emperor, obtained a copy
of Euclid among other Greek books, and the Caliph al-Ma'mun
(813-33)
similarly
obtained
manuscripts
of
Euclid, among
others, from the Byzantines.
Al-Hajjaj b. Yilsuf b. Matar made
two versions of the Elements, the
first in the reign of Hariin
ar-Rashid (786-809), the second for al-Ma'mun
;
six Books of
the second of these versions survive in a Leyden manuscript
(Cod.
Leidensis
399.
1)
which
is
being
edited along
with
an-Nairizi's commentary
by
Besthorn
and
Heiberg ^
;
this
edition was abridged, with
corrections and explanations, but
without change of substance, from the earlier version, which
appears
to be
lost.
The work was next translated by Abii
Ya'qiib Ishaq b. Hunainb. Ishaq al-'Ibadi (died 910), evidently
direct from the Greek
;
this translation seems
itself to have
perished, but we have
it as revised by Thabit
b. Qurra (died
901) in two manuscripts (No. 279 of the year 1238 and No. 280
written in 1260-1) in the Bodleian Library
; Books I-XIII in
these manuscripts are in the Ishaq-Thabit version, while the
non-Euclidean Books XIV, XV are in the translation of Qusta
b. Luqa al-Ba'labakki (died about 912).
Ishaq's version seems
to
be a model
of good
translation
;
the
technical terms are
simply and
consistently rendered, the
definitions and enun-
ciations
differ only in isolated eases from the Greek, and the
translator's
object
seems
to have
been
only
to get
rid
of
difficulties and unevennesses in the Greek text while at the
same
time giving
a
faithful
reproduction
of
it.
The
third
Arabic
version
still
accessible
to us
is
that
of Nasiraddin
at-Tusi
(born
in
1201
at
Tiis
in Khurasan);
this, however,
is not a translation of Euclid but a rewritten version based
upon the older Arabic translations.
On the whole, it appears
probable
that the
Arabic
tradition
(in
spite
of
its omission
of lemmas and porisms, and, except
in a very few cases, of
the
interpolated alternative
proofs)
is
not
to be preferred
to that of the Greek manuscripts, but must be regarded as
inferior in authority.
The known Latin translations begin with that of Athelhard,
an Englishman, of Bath
; the date of
it
is about 1120.

LATIN AND ARABIC TRANSLATIONS
363
it^ was made from the Arabic
is
clear from
the occurrence
of Arabic words
in
it;
but Athelhard must
also have had
before him
a
translation
of
(at
least)
the
enunciations
of
Euclid based
ultimately upon the Greek
text, a translation
going back to the old Latin
version which was the common
source of the passage in the Gromatici and
' Boetius
'.
But
it would appear that even before Athelhard's time some sort
of translation, or
at
least fragments
of
one, were available
even in England if one may judge by the Old English verses
:
' The clerk Euclide on
this wyse hit fonde
Thys
craft of gemetry yn Egypte londe
Yn Egypte he tawghte hyt
ful wyde,
In dyvers londe on every syde.
Mony erys afterwarde y understonde
Yer that the craft com ynto thys

Thys craft com

as y yow
say,
Yn tyme of good Kyng Adelstone's day',
which would put
the
introduction
of
Euclid
into England
as far back as A. D. 924â€”40.
Next,
Gherard
of
Cremona
(1114-87)
is
said
to
have
translated the '15 Books
of Euclid' from
the Arabic as he
undoubtedly
translated
an-Nairizi's commentary
on
Books
Iâ€”X
;
this
translation
of
the
Elements
was
till
recently
supposed
to have been
lost, but
in
1904 A. A. Bjdrnbo
dis-
covered in manuscripts at Paris, Boulogne-sur-Mer and Bruges
the whole, and at Rome Books X-XV, of a translation which
he gives good ground
for identifying with Gherard's.
This
translation has certain Greek words such as rombus, romboides,
where Athelhard keeps the Arabic terms
;
it was thus clearly
independent of Athelhard's, though Gherard appears to have
had before him, in addition, an old translation of Euclid from
the Greek which Athelhard also used.
Gherard's translation
is much
clearer than Athelhard's;
it
is neither abbreviated
nor
' edited
' in the same way as Athelhard's, but
it
is a word
for word translation
of an Arabic manuscript containing a
revised and critical edition of Thabit's version.
A third translation from the Arabic was that of Johannes
Campanus, which came some 150 years after that of Athelhard.
That Campanus's
translation was not independent of Athel-
hard's
is proved by the
fact
that,
in
all
manuscripts
and

364
EUCLID
editions, the
definitions, postulates and axioms, and the 364
enunciations are word for word
identical in Athelhard and
Campanus.
The exact relation between the two seems even
yet not to have been sufficiently elucidated.
Campanus may
have
used
Athelhard's
translation
and
only developed
the
proofs by means of another redaction of the Arabian Euclid.
Campanus's
translation
is
the
clearer and more
complete,
following
the
Greek
text
more
closely
but
still
at
some
distance
; the arrangement of the two
is different
; in Athel-
hard
the
proofs
regularly
precede
the
enunciations,
while
Campanus follows the usual order.
How
far the differences
in
the
proofs
and
the
additions
in
each
are
due
to
the
translators themselves
or go back
to
Arabic
originals
is
a
moot question;
but
it seems most probable that Campanus
stood
to Athelhard somewhat
in the
relation of a commen-
tator,
altering and improving
his
translation by means
of
other Arabic originals.
The
first printed
editions.
Campanus's translation had the luck to be the
first to be
put into print.
It was published at Venice by Erhard Ratdolt
in
1482.
This
beautiful and very
rare book was not only
the
first printed
edition of
Euclid, but also the
first printed
mathematical book
of any
importance.
It has
margins
of
2^ inches and in them are placed the figures of the proposi-
tions.
Ratdolt
says
in
his
dedication
that,
at
that
time,
although books by ancient and modern authors were being
printed every day in Venice, little
or nothing mathematical
had appeared
;
this fact he puts down to the difficulty involved
by the figures, which no one had up to that time succeeded in
printing
; he adds that after much labour he had discovered
a method by which
figures could be produced
as
easily as
letters.
Experts do not seem even yet to be agreed as to the
actual way
in which
the figures were made, whether they
were woodcuts or whether they were made by putting together
lines and
circular
arcs
as
letters are put together to make
words.
How eagerly the opportunity of spreading geometrical
knowledge
was
seized
upon
is
proved
by
the number
of
editions which
followed
in
the next few
years.
Even
the

THE
FIRST PRINTED EDITIONS
365
year 1482 saw two forms of the book, though they only differ
in the first sheet.
Another edition came out at Ulm in 1486,
and another at Vicenza in 1491.
In
1501
G. Valla gave
in his encyclopaedic work Be ex-
petendis
et fugiendis rebus a number
of
propositions with
proofs and scholia translated from a Greek manuscript which
was once in his possession; but Bartolomeo Zamberti (Zam-
bertus) was
the
first
to bring
out
a
translation from the
Greek
text
of the whole
of
the
Elements, which
appeared
at Venice
in
1505.
The most
important
Latin
translation
is, however, that of Commandinus (1509-75), who not only
followed the Greek text more
closely than
his predecessors,
but added
to
his
translation some
ancient
scholia
as
well
as good notes of his own
;
this
translation, which appeared
in
1572, was the foundation of most translations up
to the
time of Peyrard, including that of Simson, and therefore of
all those editions, numerous in England, which gave Euclid
â€¢ chiefly after the text of Dr. Simson
'.
The study of Euclid in the Middle Ages.
A word or two about the general
position of geometry in
education during the Middle Ages will not be out of place in
a book for English readers, in view of the unique place which
Euclid has
till recently held as a text-book in this country.
From the seventh to the tenth century the study of geometry
languished
:
' We
find in
the whole
literature
of that time
hardly
the
slightest
sign
that any
one
had
gone
farther
in
this department
of the Quadrivium than the
definitions
of a triangle, a square, a
circle, or of a pyramid or cone, as
Martianus Capella and Isidorus
(Hispalensis, died as Bishop
of Seville in 636)
left them.'
^
(Isidorus had disposed of the
four subjects of Arithmetic, Geometry, Music and Astronomy
in four pages
of
his encyclopaedic work
Origines or Ety-
mologiae).
In
the
tenth
century
appeared
a
'reparator
studiorum
' in the person of the great Gerbert, who was born
at Aurillac, in Auvergne, in the first half of the tenth century,
and after a very varied life ultimately (in 999) became Pope
Sylvester
II;
he
died
in
1003.
About
967
he
went
on
'
Hankel, op.
cit., pp. 311-12.

366
â€¢
EUCLID
a journey to Spain, where he studied mathematics.
In 97d he
went to Rome with Bishop Hatto of Vich (in the province of
Barcelona), and
was
there
introduced
by Pope John XIII
to
the German king Otto
I.
To
Otto, who wished to
find
him a post as a teacher, he could say that
' he knew enough of
mathematics for
this, but wished to improve
his knowledge
of
logic'.
With Otto's consent he went to Reims, where he
became
Scholasticus
or
teacher
at
the
Cathedral
School,
remaining there for about ten yeai-s, 972 to 982.
As the result
of a mathematico-philosophic argument in public at Ravenna
in 980, he was appointed by Otto II to the famous monastery
at Bobbio in Lombardy, which, fortunately for him, was rich
in
valuable
manuscripts
of
all
sorts.
Here
he
found
the
famous
' Codex
Arcerianus
'
containing
fragments
of
the
works of the Gromatici, Frontinus, Hyginus, Balbus, Nipsus,
Epaphroditus and
Vitruvius Rufus.
Although
these
frag-
ments are not in themselves of great merit, there are things
in them which show that the authors drew upon Heron
of
Alexandria,
and
Gerbert made
the
most
of
them.
They
formed
the
basis of
his own
' Geometry
', which may have
been written between the years 981 and 983.
In writing this
book Gerbert evidently had before him Boetius's Arithmetic,
and
in
the
course
of
it
he
mentions
Pythagoras,
Plato's
Timaeus, with Chalcidius's commentary thereon, and Eratos-
thenes.
The geometry in the book
is mostly practical; the
theoretical part
is confined to necessary preliminary matter,
definitions, &c.,and a few proofs
; the fact that the sum of the
angles of a triangle is equal
to two right angles
is proved in
Euclid's manner.
A great part
is taken up with the solution
of triangles, and with heights and distances.
The Archimedean
value
of n
(-\^-)
is used
in stating the area of a circle; the
surface of a sphere
is given as |^ Z)'.
The plan
of the book
is quite different from that of Euclid, showing that Gerbert
could
neither have had
Euclid's Elements
before
him,
nor,
probably,
Boetius's
Gevmetry,
if
that work
in
its
genuine
form was a version
of
Euclid.
When
in
a
letter
written
probably from
Bobbio
in
983
to
Adalbero,
Archbishop
of
Reims, he speaks of his expectation of finding
' eight volumes
of Boetius on
astronomy,
also
the most famous
of
figures
(presumably propositions)
in geometry and other things not

STUDY OF EUCLID IN THE MIDDLE AGES
367
less admirable
',
it is not
clear that he actually found these
things, and it is
still less certain that the geometrical matter
referred to was Boetius's Geometry.
From Gerbert's time, again, no further progress was made
until translations from the Arabic began with Athelhard and
the
rest.
Gherard
of Cremona
(die!
1187), who translated
the EleTnents and an-Nairizi's commentary thereon, is credited
with a whole series of translations from the Arabic of Greek
authors
; they included the Data of Euclid, the Sphaenca of
Theodosius, the Sphaerica of Menelaus, the Syntaxis of Ptolemy
;
besides which he translated Arabian geometrical works such
as the Liber trlum fratrum, and also the algebra of Muhammad
b. Musa.
One of the first results of the interest thus aroused
in
Greek and Arabian
mathematics was
seen
in the very
remarkable works of Leonardo of Pisa (Fibonacci).
Leonardo
first published in 1202, and then brought out later (1228) an
improved edition
of,
his Liber abaci in which he gave
the
whole of arithmetic and algebra as known to the Arabs, but
in a free and independent style of his own
;
in like manner in
his Practica geometriae of 1220 he collected
(1) all that the
Elements of Euclid and Archimedes's books on the Measure-
m,ent of a Circle and On the Sp)here and Cylinder had taught
him
about
the measurement
of
plane
figures
bounded by
straight lines, solid figures bounded by planes, the circle and
the
sphere
respectively,
(2)
divisions of
figures
in
difierent
proportions, wherein he based himself on Euclid's book On the
divisions offigures, but carried the subject further,
(3) some
trigonometry, which he got from Ptolemy and Arabic sources
(he
uses
the
terms sinus
rectus and sinus versus)
;
in the
treatment of these varied subjects he shawed the same mastery
and, in places, distinct originality.
We should have expected
a
great general advance in the next centuries after such a
beginning, but, as Hankel says, when we look at the work of
Luca Paciuolo nearly three centuries
later, we find that the
talent which Leonardo had
left to the Latin world had lain
hidden in a napkin and earned no interest.
As regards the
place of geometry in education during this period we have
the
evidence
of
Roger
Bacon
(1214-94),
though
he,
it
is
true, seems
to have
taken an
exaggerated view
of
the
incompetence
of
the
mathematicians
and
teachers
of
his

368
EUCLID
time;
the
philosophers
of
his
day, he
says,
despised
geo-
metry,
languages,
&c.,
declaring
that
they
were
useless;
people
in general, not finding utility in any science such as
geometry,
at once recoiled, unless they were boys forced
to
it by
the
rod, from the
idea
of studying
it,
so that
they
would hardly learn
as much as three or four propositions;
the
fifth
proposition
of Euclid was
called Elefuga or fuga
miserorum}
As regards Euclid at the Universities, it may be noted that
the study of geometry seems to have been neglected at the
University of Paris.
At the reformation of the University in
1336 it was only provided that no one should take a Licentiate
who had not attended lectures on some mathematical books
the same requirement reappears in 1452 and 1600.
From the
preface to a commentary on Euclid which appeared in 1536
we learn that a candidate for the degree of M.A. had to take
a solemn oath that he had attended lectures on the first
six
Books
; but it
is doubtful whether for the examinations more
than Book I was necessary, seeing that the proposition I. 47
was known
as
Magister matheseos.
At
the
University
of
Prague (founded
in
1348) mathematics were more regarded.
Candidates for the Baccalaureate had
to attend
lectures on
the Tractatus de Sphaera materiali, a treatise on the funda-
mental ideas of spherical astronomy, mathematical geography
and the ordinary astronomical phenomena, but without the
help of mathematical
propositions,
written by Johannes de
Sacrobosco
(i.e. of Holywood, in Yorkshire)
in 1250, a book
which was
read
at
all
Universities
for four
centuries and
many times commented upon
;
for the Master's degree lectures
on
the
first
six Books
of Euclid were compulsory.
Euclid
was lectured upon at the Universities of Vienna (founded 1365),
Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388)
; at Heidelberg an oath was
required from the candidate for the Licentiate corresponding
to M.A. that he had attended lectures on some whole books and
not merely parts of several books (not necessarily, it appears,
of Euclid)
;
at Vienna,
the
first
five Books of Euclid were
required
; at Cologne, no mathematics were required for the
Baccalaureate, but the candidate for M.A. must have attended
' Roger Bacon, Opus Teiihim, co. iv, vi.

STUDY OF EUCLID IN THE MIDDLE AGES
369
lectures on the Sphaera miondi, planetary theory, three Books
of Euclid, optics and arithmetic.
At Leipzig (founded 1409),
as at Vienna and Prague, there were
lectures on Euclid
for
some time at all events, though Hankel says that he found no
mention of Euclid in a list of lectures given in the consecutive
years 1437-8, and Eegiomontanus, when he went
to Leipzig,
found no fellow-students
in
geometry.
At
Oxford,
in
the
middle of the fifteenth century, the first two Books of Euclid
were read, and doubtless the Cambridge course was similar.
The
first English
editions.
After
the
issue
of
the
first
printed
editions
of
Euclid,
beginning
with
the
translation
of
Campano,
published by
Ratdolt, and of the editio 'priticeps of the Greek text (1533),
the study
of
Euclid
received a great
impetus, as
is shown
by the number of separate editions and commentaries which
appeared in the sixteenth century.
The first complete English
translation by Sir Henry Billingsley (1570) was a monumental
work of 928 pages of folio
size, with a preface by John Dee,
and notes extracted from all the most important commentaries
from
Proclus down
to Dee himself, a magnificent tribute to
the immortal Euclid.
About the same time Sir Henry Savile
began to give unpaid lectures on the Greek geometers
; those
on
Euclid do not indeed extend beyond
I.
8, but they are
valuable because they deal with the difiiculties connected with
the
preliminary
matter,
the
definitions,
&c., and
the
tacit
assumptions contained in the
first propositions.
But
it was
in the period from about 1660
to
1730, during which Wallis
and
Halley
were
Professors
at
Oxford,
and
Barrow
and
Newton at Cambridge, that the study of Greek mathematics
was at its height in England.
As regards Euclid in particular
Barrow's
influence
was
doubtless
very
great.
His
Latin
version
{Eihclidis Elementorum Librl XV breviter demon-
strati) came out in 1655, and there were several more editions
of the same published up
to 1732;
his
first English edition
appeared in
1660, and was followed by others in
1705, 1722,
1732, 1751.
This brings us to Simson's edition, first published
both in Latin and English in
1756.
It
is presumably from
this time onwards that Euclid acquired the unique status as
1623
B b

370
EUCLID
a text-book which it maintained' till recently.
I cannot help
thinking
that
it was Barrow's
influence which
contributed
most powerfully
to
this.
We are
told
that Newton, when
he first bought a Euclid in 1662 or 1663, thought it
' a trifling
book
',
as
the
propositions
seemed
to him obvious
;
after-
wards, however, on Barrow's advice, he studied the Elements
carefully
and
derived,
as
he
himself
stated, much
benefit
therefrom.
Technical terms connected with the
classical form
of a proposition.
As the
classical form of a proposition in geometry is that
which we
find
in
Euclid, though
it did not originate with
him,
it
is desirable, before we proceed
to an analysis of the
Elements, to give some account of the technical terms used by
the Greeks
in
connexion with
such
propositions and
their
proofs.
We will take first the terms employed to describe the
formal divisions of a proposition.
(a)
Terms for
the formal divisions of a proposition.
In
its completest form a proposition
contained
six
parts,
(1)
the
irpoTaa-is,
or enunciation
in
general
terms,
(2)
the
(KOea-is, or setting-out, which states the particular data,
e. g.
a given straight line AB, two given triangles ABC, DEF, and
the
like, generally shown
in a figure and constituting that
upon which the proposition
is
to operate,
(3)
the
Siopiafio^,
definition or
specification, which means the restatement
of
what it is required to do or to prove in terms of the particular
data, the object being to fix our ideas,
(4) the Karaa-Kev^, the
construction or machinery used, which includes any additions
to the original figure by way of construction that are necessary
to enable the proof to proceed, (5)
the dwoSei^i^, or the proof
itself, and (6) the o-vfnrepacrfia, or conclusion, which reverts to
the
enunciation, and
states what has been proved or done
â€¢
the conclusion can, of course, be stated in as general terms
as the enunciation,- since
it does not depend on the particular
figure drawn
; that figure is only an illustration, a type of the
class
of
figure,
and
it
is
legitimate
therefore,
in
stating
the
conclusion,
to
pass from
the
particular
to
the
general.

FORMAL DIVISIONS OF A PROPOSITION
371
In
particular
cases some
of
these formal
divisions may be
absent, but
three are always found, the eniinciation, proof
and conclusion.
Thus
in many propositions no construction
is
needed, the given
figure
itself
sufficing
for
the
proof
;
again, in IV. 10 (to construct an isosceles triangle
v\rith each
of the base angles double
of the vertical angle) we may, in
a sense, say with Proclus ^ that there is neither setting-out nor
definition, for there
is nothing given in the enunciation, and
we set out, not a given straight line, but any straight line AB,
while the proposition does not state (what might be said by
way of definition) that the required triangle is to have AB for
one of its equal sides.

The
Siopicrfios
or statement of conditions of possibility.
Sometimes to the statement of a problem there has to be
added a SiopLa/jios in the more important and familiar sense of
a
criterion
of
the
conditions
of
possibility
or,
in
its most
complete
form, a
criterion
as
to
' whether what
is
sought
is impossible or possible and how far it
is practicable and in
how many ways'.^
Both kinds of Siopia/xos begin with the
words Set
Srj, which should be translated, in the case of the
definition,
' thus it is required (to prove or do so and so)
' and,
in the case of the criterion of possibility,
' thus it is necessary
that
.
.
.'
(not
' but
it
is
necessary

is necessary that two
of the straight lines taken together in any manner should be
greater than the remaining straight line

Analysis,
synthesis, reduction, reductio ad absurdum.
The Elements is a synthetic treatise in that it goes directly
forward the whole way, always proceeding from the known
to the unknown, from the simple and particular to the more
complex
and
general
;
hence
analysis, which
reduces
the
unknown
or the more complex
to the known, has no place
in the exposition, though
it would play an important part in
the
discovery
of
the
proofs.
A
full account of the Greek
analysis and synthesis will come more conveniently elsewhere.

In the meantime we may observe that, where a proposition
is worked out by analysis followed by synthesis, the analysis
comes between
the
definition and the construction
of
the
proposition
; and
it should not be forgotten that reductio ad
absurdum,
(called
in
Greek

'reduction
to the
impossible',
or

Sia

Sii^is

'proof

a
method
of
proof
common
in
Euclid
as
elsewhere,
is
a
variety
of
analysis.
For analysis begins with reduction {dwaycoyri) of the original
proposition, which we hypothetically assume
to be ^true, to
something simpler which we can recognize as being either
true or false
; the case where
it leads to a conclusion known
to be false is the reductio ad absurdum.
(S)
Case,
objection, 2)orism, lemma.
Other terms connected with propositions are the following.
A proposition may have several cases according to the different
arrangements
of
points,
lines,
&c.,
in
the
figure that may
result from variations in the positions of the elements given
the word
for
case
is
nrSxris.
The
practice
of
the
great
geometers was, as a rule, to give only one case, leaving the
others for commentators or pupils
to supply
for themselves.
But they were
fully
alive
to
the
existence
of
such
other
cases
; sometimes, if we may believe Proclus, they would even
give a proposition solely with a view to its use for the purpose
of proving a case
of a
later
proposition which
is
actually
omitted.
Thus, according to Proclus,^ the second part of I. 5
(about the angles beyond the
base) was intended to enable
the
reader
to meet
an
objection
(iva-Tatns)
that might
be
raised to
I.
7 as given by Euclid on the ground that
it was
incomplete, since
it took no account of what was given by
Proclus himself, and is now generally given in our text-books,
as the second case.
What we
call a
corollai-y
was
for
the Greeks a porism
(iropia-fia),
i. e. something provided or ready-made, by which
was meant some
result
incidentally revealed
in
the course
of the demonstration of the main proposition under discussion,
a sort
of incidental gain' arising
out
of the demonstration,
' Proclus on Eucl. I, pp. 248. 8-11
; 263. 4-8.

TECHNICAL TERMS
373
as
Proclus
says.^
The name porism was
also applied
to a
special kind of substantive proposition, as in Euclid's separate
work in three Books entitled Porisms (see below, pp. 431-8).
The word lemma {Xfjujia) simply means something assumed.
Archimedes uses
it of what
is now known as the Axiom
of
Archimedes, the principle assumed by Eudoxus and others in
the method of exhaustion
;
but
it
is more commonly used
of a subsidiary proposition requiring
proof, which, however,
it
is convenient to assume in the place where
it
is wanted
in order that the argument may not be interrupted or unduly
lengthened.
Such a lemma might be proved in advance, but
the proof was often postponed
till the end, the assumption
being marked as something to be afterwards proved by some
such words as coy i^fjs 8ei.\6rjcrâ‚¬Tai,
' as will be proved in due
course
'.
Analysis of the Elements.
Book I of the Elevients necessarily begins with the essential
preliminary matter classified under the headings Definitions
(opoi),
Postulates
(aiTrjf^aTa) and Common
Notions
{koivoi
ivvoiai).
In
calling
the
axioms
Gomtnon
Notions
Euclid
followed the lead of Aristotle, who uses as
alternatives
for
' axioms
' the terms
' common (things)
',
' common opinions
'.
Many of the Definitions are open to criticism on one gTOund
or another.
Two of them at least seem to be original, namely,
the definitions of a straight line (4) and of a plane surface (7)
;
unsatisfactory
as these
are, they seem
to be
capable
of
a
simple
explanation.
The
definition
of
a
straight
line
is
apparently an
attempt
to
express, without
any
appeal
to
sight, the sense of Plato's definition
' that of which the middle
covers the ends
' (sc. to an eye placed at one end and looking
along it)
; and the definition of a plane surface is an adaptation
of
the same
definition.
But most
of
the
definitions
were
probably adopted from earlier text-books
; some appear to be
inserted merely out of respect for tradition,
e.g. the defini-
tions
of
oblong,
rhombus, rhomboid, which
are never used
in the Elements.
The
definitions of various figures assume
the
existence
of
the thing
defined,
e. g. the square, and the
'

EUCLID
different kinds of triangle under their twofold
classification
(a) with
reference
to
their
sides
(equilateral, isosceles
and
scalene), and
(b) with reference to their angles (right-angled,
obtuse-angled and
acute-angled)
;
such
definitions
are
pro-
visional pending the proof of existence by means of actual con-
struction.
A pa7'allelogram
is not defined;
its
existence
is
first proved in
I. 33, and in the next proposition it is called a
' parallelogrammic area
', meaning an area contained by parallel
lines, in preparation for the use of the simple word
' parallelo-
gram' from
I.
35
onwards.
The
definition
of a
diameter
of a circle (17) includes a theorem
;
for Euclid adds that
' such
a
straight
line
also
bisects
the
circle', which
is one
of the
theorems attributed to Thales
; but
this addition was really
necessary in
view
of
the next definition
(18),
for, without
this
explanation,
Euclid would not
have
been
justified
in
describing a
semt-circle
as a portion of a
circle cut
off by
a diameter.
More important by far are the
five Postulates, for 'it is in
them that Euclid lays down the real principles of Euclidean
geometry
; and nothing shows more clearly his determination
to
reduce
his
original assumptions
to
the
very minimum.
The
first
three
Postulates
are
commonly
regarded
as
the
postulates
of
construction,
since they assert
the
possibility
(1) of drawing the
straight
line joining two
points,
(2)
of
producing a straight line in either direction, and (3) of describ-
ing a
circle with a given centre and
' distance
'.
But they
imply much more than this.
In Postulates
1 and
3
Euclid
postulates
the
existence
of
straight
lines and
circles, and
implicitly answers the objections of those who might say that,
as a matter
of
fact, the straight lines and
circles which we
can draw
are
not mathematical
straight
lines and
circles
Euclid may be supposed to assert that we can nevertheless
assume our straight lines and circles to be such for the purpose
of our proofs, since they are only illustrations enabling us to
imagine
the
real things which
they imperfectly
represent.
But, again. Postulates
1 and 2 further imply that the straight
line drawn in the first case and the produced portion of the
straight line
in the second case are unique
;
in other words,
Postulate
1
implies that two straight
lines cannot enclose a
space, and so renders unnecessary the
' axiom
'
to that
effect

THE ELEMENTS.
BOOK
I
375
interpolated in Proposition 4, while Postulate 2
similarly im-
plies
the
theorem
that two
straight
lines cannot have a
common segment, which Simson gave as a corollary to
I.
11.
At
first
sight
the
Postulates
4
(that
all right angles are
equal) and
5
(the
Parallel-Postulate)
might
seem
to
be
of
an altogether different character, since they are rather of the
nature of theorems unproved.
But Postulate 5 is easily seen
to
be
connected
with
constructions,
because
so many
con-
structions depend on the existence and use of points in which
straight lines intersect
;
it is therefore absolutely necessary to
lay down some criterion by which we can judge whether two
straight lines in a figure
will or will hot meet if produced.
Postulate
5
serves this purpose as well as that of providing
a basis
for the theory of
parallel
lines.
Strictly speaking,
Euclid
ought
to have gone
further and given
criteria
for
judging whether other pairs of lines, e.g. a straight line and
a
circle, or two circles, in a particular figure will or will- not
intersect one
another.
But
this would have
necessitated a
considerable
series of propositions, which
it would have been
difficult to frame
at
so early a
stage, and Euclid preferred
to assume such
intersections
provisionally
in
certain
cases,
e.g. in I.
1.
Postulate 4 is often classed as a theorem.
But it had in any
case to be placed before Postulate 5 for the simple reason that
Postulate
5 would be no criterion at
all unless right angles
were determinate magnitudes
; Postulate 4 then declares them
to be such.
But this
is not
all.
If Postulate 4 were to be
proved as a theorem, it could only be proved by applying one
pair of
' adjacent ' right angles to another pair.
This method
would not be
valid unless on the assumption of the invaria-
bility offigures, which would therefore have to be asserted as
an
antecedent
postulate.
Euclid
preferred
to
assert
as a
postulate, directly, the
fact that
all right angles are equal
;
hence his postulate may be taken as equivalent to the prin-
ciple of the invariability offigures, or, what is the same thing,
the homogeneity of space.
For reasons which I have given above (pp. 339, 358), I think
that the great Postulate
5
is due to Euclid himself; and
it
seems probable that Postulate 4
is also
his, if not Postulates
1-3
as
well.

376
EUCLID
Of
the Common Notions
there
is good reason
to believe
that only five
(at the most) are genuine, the
first three and
two
others, namely
' Things which coincide when applied to
one another are equal
to one another
'
(4), and
' The whole
is
greater than
the part'
(5).
The objection
to
(4)
is that
it
is
incontestably
geometrical, and therefore, on^Aristotle's
principles, should not be classed as an
' axiom
'
;
it is a more
or
less
sufficient
definition
of geometrical
equality, but not
a real axiom.
Euclid evidently disliked the method of super-
position for proving equality, no doubt because it assumes the
possibility of motion without deformation.
But he could not
dispense with
it altogether.
Thus in
I. 4 he practically had
to choose between using the method and assuming the whole
proposition
as
a
postulate.
But
he
does not
there
quote
Comynon Notion
4
; he says
' the base BG will coincide with
the base EF and will be equal
to
it '.
Similarly in
I.
6 he
does not quote Common
Notion
5, but says
' the
triangle
DEC will be equal to the triangle AGB, the less to the greater,
which
is
absurd'.
It seems
probable,
therefore,
that
even
these two Common
Notions, though
apparently
recognized
by
Proclus, were
generalizations from
particular inferences
found in Euclid and were inserted after his time.
The propositions of Book I
fall into three distinct groups.
The
first group
consists of Propositions 1-26, dealing mainly
with
triangles (without the
use
of
parallels) but also with
perpendiculars
(11,
12), two intersecting straight
lines
(15),
and one straight line standing on another but not cutting
it,
and making
'adjacent'
or
supplementary
angles
(13,
14).
Proposition
1 gives the construction of an equilateral triangle
on a given straight
line as base
;
this
is placed here not so
much on its own account as because it is at once required for
constructions
(in
2,
9,
10,
11).
The construction
in
2
is a
direct
continuation
of the mininmm
constructions assumed
in Postulates 1-3, and enables us (as the Postulates do not) to
transfer a given
length
of
straight
line from one
place
to
another
;
it leads
in
3
to the operation so often required
of
cutting
off from one given
straight
line
a
length equal
to
another.
9 and
1
are the problems of bisecting a given angle
and a given
straight
line
respectively, and
11
shows how
to erect a perpendicular to a given straight line from a given

THE ELEMENTS.
BOOK

377
point on
it.
Construction as a means of proving existence is
in evidence in the Booli, not only in
1 (the equilateral triangle)
but
in
11,
12
(perpendiculars
erected and
let
fall), and
in
22 (construction of a triangle in the general case where the
lengths of the sides are given)
;
23 constructs, by means of 22,
an angle equal to a given
rectilineal angle.
The propositions
about triangles include the congruence-theorems
(4,
8, 26)
omitting
the
'ambiguous
case'
which
is
only
taken
into
account in the analogous proposition (7) of Book VIâ€”and the
theorems
(allied to 4) about two triangles in which two sides
of the one are respectively equal to two sides of the other, but
of the included angles (24) or of the bases (25) one
is greater
than the other, and it is proved that the triangle in which the
included angle is greater has the greater base and vice versa.
Proposition
7, used to prove Proposition
8, is also important as
being the Book I equivalent of III. 10 (that two circles cannot
intersect in more points than two).
Then we have theorems
about
single
triangles
in
5,
6
(isosceles
triangles have
the
angles opposite to the equal sides equalâ€”Thales's theorem
and the converse), the important propositions 16 (the exterior
angle of a triangle
is greater than either of the interior and
opposite
angles)
and
its
derivative
17
(any two
angles
of
a
triangle
are together
less than tw@ right
angles),
18,
19
(greater angle subtended by
greater
side
and
vice
versa),
20 (any two sides together greater than the third).
This last
furnishes the necessary StopKr/ios, or criterion of possibility, of
the problem
in
22
of constructing a
triangle
out
of
three
straight lines of given
length, which problem had therefore
to come after and not before
20.
21
(proving that the two
sides of a triangle other than the base are together greater,
but include a lesser angle, than the two sides of any other
triangle on the same base but with vertex within the original
triangle) is useful for the proof of the proposition (not stated
in Euclid) that of
all straight lines drawn from an external
point
to
a
given
straight
line
the
perpendicular
is
the
shortest, and the nearer to the perpendicular
is less than the
more remote.
The second group (27-32) includes the theory of parallels
(27-31, ending with the construction through a given point
of a parallel to a given straight line)
; and then, in 32, Euclid

378
EUCLID
proves that the sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal
to two right angles by means of a parallel to one side drawn
from
the
opposite verteK
(cf. the
slightly
different
Pytha-
gorean proof, p. 143).
The
third group
of
propositions
(33-48)
deals generally
with parallelograms, triangles and squares with reference
to
their areas.
S3, 34 amount to the proof of the existence and
the property of a parallelogram, and then we are introduced
to
a new
conception,
that
of
equivalent
figures, or
figures
equal
in
area though not equal in the sense of congruent
parallelograms on the same base or on equal bases and between
the same parallels are equal in area (35, 36); the same is true
of triangles (37, 38), and a parallelogram on the same
(or an
equal) base with a triangle and between the same parallels is
double
of the triangle
(41).
39 and the interpolated 40 are
partial converses of 37 and
38.
The theorem 41 enables us
' to
construct
in
a given
rectilineal angle
a parallelogram
equal to a given triangle'
(42).
Propositions 44, 45 are of
the greatest importance, being the
first cases of the Pytha-
gorean method of
' application of areas \
' to apply to a given
straight
line,
in
a
given
rectilineal
angle,
a
parallelogram
equal
to a given triangle
(or
rectilineal
figure)
'.
The con-
struction in 44
is remarkably ingenious, being based on that
of
42 combined with the proposition
(43) proving that the
' complements of the parallelograms about the diameter
' in any
parallelogram are equal.
We are thus enabled to transform
a
parallelogram
of any shape
into another with
the same
angle and of equal area but with one side of any given length,
say a
i(^nit length
; this
is the geometrical equivalent of the
algebraic operation of dividing the product of two quantities
by a third.
Proposition 46 constructs a square on any given
straight line as side, and is followed by the great Pythagorean
theorem
of the
square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled
triangle
(47) and
its converse
(48).
The remarkably clever
proof of 47 by means of the well-known 'windmill' figure
and the application to
it of I. 41 combined with I. 4 seems to
be due to Euclid himself
;
it is really equivalent to a proof by
the methods of Book VI
(Propositions
8,
17), and
Euclid's
achievement was that of avoiding the use of proportions and
making the proof dependent upon Book I only.

THE ELEMENTS.
BOOKS

379
I make no apology for having dealt at some length with
Book
I and,
in particular, with the
preliminary matter,
in
view
of the unique
position and authority of the Elements
as
an
exposition
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
Greek
geometry, and the necessity for the historian of mathematics
of
a
clear understanding
of
their nature and
full
import.
It
will now be
possible
to
deal more summarily with
the
other Books.
Book II
is a continuation of the third section of Book
I,
relating to the transformation of areas, but
is
specialized in
that
it
deals, not with parallelograms
in
general, but with
rectangles and
squares, and makes
great use of
the
figure
called the gnomon.
The rectangle
is introduced (Def.
1) as
a
' rectangular parallelogram
', which
is said to be
' contained
by the two straight lines containing the right angle
'.
The
gnomon
is defined (Def.
2) with reference to any parallelo-
gram, but
the only gnomon actually used
is naturally that
which belongs
to a square.
The whole Book constitutes an
essential
part
of
the
geometinoal
algebra
which
really,
in
Greek geometry, took the place of our algebra.
The first ten
propositions give the equivalent of the following algebraical
identities.
1.
a{b + c + d+ ...) = ab + ac + ad + ...,
2.
{a + b)a + {a + b)b = {a + by,
3.
(a + b)a = ab+a^,
4.
{a + by = a^ + b^ + 2ab,

ab+{^{a + b)-b]^= {k{a + b)}\
or
(a-l-/3)(a-/3) + y32.= o<^
6.
{2a + b)h + a^=ia + bf,
or
(a + ^)(/3-a) + a' = /3^
7.
{a + bf + a^ = 2{a + b)a + b^
or
a2 + i82=2a)3 + (a-/8)^
8.
4{a + b)a + b''= {{a + b) + a}^,
or

10.
{2a + by + b'' = 2{a^ + {a + bf},
or
(a + ^f + (|8 - a)2 = 2 (a^ + /J^).
As we have
seen (pp. 151-3), Propositions
5 and 6 enable us
to solve the quadratic equations
(1)
ax-x^ = b^
or
^^^^,J,
o
7o
-y â€” ic = a)
and
(2)
ax + x^ = b^
or

xy = b^)
The
procedure
is geometrwal throughout;
the
areas
in
all
the
Propositions
1-8
are
actually
shown
in
the
figures.
Propositions 9 and 10 were really intended to solve a problem
in numbers, that of finding any number of successive pairs
of integral numbers
(' side-
' and
' diameter-
' numbers) satisfy-
ing the equations
2x^-y- = +1
(see p. 93, above).
Of the remaining propositions,
II.
11 and
II. 14 give the
geometrical equivalent of solving the quadratic equations
x^ + ax =

and
x^ = ab,
while the intervening propositions
12 and
13 prove, for any
triangle with sides a, &, c, the equivalent of the formula
Â«'^ = i^ + c^ â€” 2&C cos J..
It
is worth noting
that, while
I. 47 and
its converse con-
clude Book I as
if that Book was designed
to lead up to the
great proposition of Pj^thagoras, the last propositions but one
of Book
II
give the generalization of the same proposition
with any triangle substituted for a right-angled triangle.
The
subject
of Book
III
is
the geometry
of
the
circle,
including the
relations between
circles
cutting
or touching
each
other.
It
begins
with
some
definitions, which
are

generally of the same sort as those of Book I.
Definition
1,
stating that equal circles are those which have their diameters
or
their
radii
equal, might
alternatively be
regarded
a9 a
postulate or a theorem
;
if stated as a theorem, it could only
be proved by superposition and the congruence-axiom.
It is
curious that the Greeks had no single word for radius, which
was with them
' the (straight
line) from the centre
',
77 e< rov
Kivrpov.
A tangent to a circle is defined (Def. 2) as a straight
line which meets the
circle but,
if produced, does not cut
it
;
this is provisional pending the proof in III. 16 that such lines
exist.

test being the length of the perpendicular from
the centre on the chord) might have referred, more generally,
to
the
distance
of any
straight
line from any
point.
The
definition (7) of the 'angle of & segment' (the 'mixed' angle
made by the circumference with
the base at either end)
is
a
survival from
earlier text-books
(cf.
Props.
16,
31).
The
definitions of
the
' angle in a segment
'
(8) and
of
' similar
segments' (11) assume (provisionally pending III. 21) that the
angle in a segment is one and the same at whatever point of
the circumference it is formed.
A sector {to/kvs, explained by
a
scholiast
as
(tkvtotoiilko^
To/ievs, a shoemaker's knife)
is
defined (10), but there
is nothing about
' similar sectors
' and
no statement that similar segments belong to similar sectors.
Of the propositions of Book III we may distinguish certain
groups.
Central
properties
account
for
four
propositions,
namely
1
(to find the centre of a circle), 3 (any straight line
through
the
centre which
bisects
any
chord
not
passing
through the
centre cuts
it at right
angles, and
vice
versa),
4 (two chords not passing through the centre cannot
bisect
one another) and 9
(the centre
is the only point from which
more
than
two
equal
straight
lines can be drawn
to
the
circumference).
Besides
3, which shows
that any diameter
bisects the whole series of chords at right angles to it, three
other propositions throw
light on
the form
of the circum-
ference of a circle, 2 (showing that
it
is everywhere concave
towards the centre), 7 and 8 (dealing with the varying lengths
of straight lines drawn from any point, internal or external,
to the concave or convex circumference, as the case may
be,

382
EUCLID
and proving that they are of maximum or minimum length
when they pass through the centre, and that they diminish or
increase as they diverge more and more from the maximum
or minimum straight lines on either side, while the lengths of
any two which are equally inclined to them, one on each side,
are equal).
Two
circles which cut or touch one another are dealt with
in
5, 6
(the two circles cannot have the same
centre),
10,
13
(they cannot cut in more points than two, or touch at more
points than one), 11 and the interpolated 12 (when they touch,
the line of centres passes through the point of contact).
14, 15 deal with chords (which are equal if equally distant
from the
centre and
vice
versa, while chords more
distant
from the centre are
less, and chords less distant greater, and
vice versa).
16-19 are concerned with tangent properties including the
drawing
of a
tangent
(17);
it
is in
16
that we have
the
survival of the
' angle of a, semicircle
', which is proved greater
than any acute rectilineal angle, while the 'remaining' angle
(the
' angle
'
, afterwards
called
KepaToeiSrjs,
or
' hornlike
',
between the curve and the tangent at the point of contact)
is
less
than any
rectilineal
angle.
These
' mixed
'
angles,
occurring
in
16 and
31, appear no more
in
serious Greek
geometry, though
controversy about
their nature went on
in
the works
of commentators down
to
Clavius,
Peletarius
(Pel^tier), Vieta, Galilei' and Wallis.
We now come to propositions about segments.
20 proves
that
the
angle
at the
centre
is double of the angle at the
circumference, and 21 that the angles in the same segment are
all
equal, which
leads
to the property of the
quadrilateral
in
a
circle
(22).
After
propositions
(23,
24)
on
'similar
segments
', it is proved that in equal circles equal arcs subtend
and are subtended by equal angles at the centre or circum-
ference, and equal
arcs subtend and are subtended by equal
chords
(26-9).
30
is the problem of
bisecting a given
arc,
and 31 proves that the angle in a segment
is right, acute or
obtuse according as the segment
is a semicircle, greater than
a
semicircle
or
less than a
semicircle.
32 proves that
the
angle made by
a tangent with a chord
through the
point
of
contact
is
equal
to
the angle
in the alternate segment;

THE ELEMENTS.
BOOKS
III-IV

33, 34 are problems of constructing or cutting off a segment
containing a given angle, and 25 constructs the complete circle
when a segment of it is given.
The Book ends with three important propositions.
Given
a circle and any point 0, internal (35) or external
(36), then,
if any straight line through
meets the
circle in P, Q, the
rectangle FO
. OQ
is
constant and,
in
the
case where
is
an external point, is equal to the square on the tangent from
to the circle.
Proposition 37 is the converse of 36.
Book IV, consisting entirely of problems, again deals with
circles, but in relation to rectilineal figures inscribed or circum-
scribed
to
them.
After
definitions
of
these
terms,
Euclid
shows, in the preliminary Proposition
1, how to fit into a circle
a chord of given length, being less than the diameter.
The
remaining problems are problems
of
inscribing
or
circum-
scribing
rectilineal
figures.
The case of the
triangle comes
first, and we learn how to inscribe in or circumscribe about
a circle a triangle equiangular with a given triangle
(2, 3) and
to inscribe a circle in or circumscribe a circle about a given
triangle
(4,
5).
6-9 are the same problems for a square,
1 1-
14 for a regular pentagon, and 15 (with porism) for a regular
hexagon.
The porism to
15
also states that the side of the
inscribed regular hexagon
is manifestly equal to the radius
of the circle.
16 shows how to inscribe in a circle a regular
polygon with fifteen angles, a problem suggested by astronomy,
since the obhquity of the ecliptic was taken to be about 24Â°,
or one-fifteenth of 360Â°.
IV. 10
is the important proposition,
required
for
the
construction
of
a
regular
pentagon,
'to
construct
an
isosceles
triangle
such
that each
of
the
base
angles
is double of the
vertical angle ', which
is effected by
dividing one
of the equal
sides in extreme and mean
ratio
(II.
11) and fitting into
the
circle with
this
side as radius
a chord equal to the greater segment
; the proof of the con-
struction depends on III. 32 and 37.
We
are not surprised
to learn from a
scholiast that
the
whole Book
is
' the
discovery
of the Pythagoreans '}
The
same
scholium
says
that
'it
is proved
in
this Book
that
the perimeter of a circle is not triple of its diameter, as many
1 Euclid, ed. Heib., vol. v, pp. 272-3.

suppose, but
greater than
that
(the
reference
is
clearly
to
IV.
15
For.), and
likewise that
neither
is the
circle
three-
fourths of the triangle circumscribed about
it
'.
Were these
fallacies perhaps exposed in the lost Pseudaria of Euclid ?
Book V
is
devoted
to
the
new
theory
of
proportion,
applicable
to
incommensurable
as
well
as
commensurable
magnitudes, and to magnitudes of every kind (straight
lines,
areas,
volumes,
numbers,
times,
&c.),
which
was
due
to
Eudoxus.
Greek mathematics
can
boast no finer discovery
than this theory, which first put on a sound footing so much
of geometry as depended on the use of proportions.
How far
Eudoxus himself worked out his theory in detail is unknown
the scholiast who attributes the discovery of
it to him says
that
' it
is recognized by all
' that Book V
is, as regards
its
arrangement and sequence
in the
Elements,
due
to
Euclid
himself.^
The ordering of the propositions and the develop-
ment of the proofs are indeed masterly and worthy of Euclid
as Barrow
said,
' There
is nothing in the whole body of the
elements
of a more subtile invention, nothing more
solidly
established, and more accurately handled, than the doctrine of
proportionals'.
It
is a pity
that, notwithstanding
the
pre-
eminent place which Euclid has occupied in English mathe-
matical teaching, Book V itself is little known in detail
;
if
it
were,
there would,
I
think,
be
less
tendency
to
seek
for
substitutes
;
indeed,
after
reading some
of
the
substitutes,
it
is
with
relief
that one turns
to
the
original.
For
this
reason,
I
shall make my account of Book V somewhat
full,
with the object of indicating not only the whole content but
also the course of the proofs.
Of
the
Definitions
the
following
are
those which
need
separate mention.
The
definition
(3)
of ratio as 'a
sort
of
relation (noia
a-)(ecns) in respect of
size {trrjXiKOTrjs) between
two magnitudes
of the same
kind'
is
as vague and
of
as
little practical use as that of a straight line
;
it was probably
inserted for completeness' sake, and in order merely to aid the
conception of a ratio.
Definition
4
(' Magnitudes are said
to
have a ratio to one another which are capable, when multi-
plied, of exceeding one another ') is important not only because
1 Euclid, ed. Heib., vol.
v,
p. 282.

THE ELEMENTS.
BOOK V
385
it shows
that
the
magnitudes must be
of
the same kind,
but
because, while
it
includes incommensurable
as
well as
commensurable magnitudes, it excludes the relation of a finite
magnitude to a magnitude of the same kind which is either
infinitely great or infinitely small
;
it is also practically equiva-
lent to the principle which underlies the method of exhaustion
now known as the Axiom of Archimedes.
Most important
of all
is the fundamental definition
(5) of magnitudes which
are in the same ratio
:
' Magnitudes are said to be in the same
ratio, the first to the second and the third to the fourth, when,
if any equimultiples whatever be taken of the first and third,
and any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth, the
former equimultiples alike exceed, are alike equal to, or alike
fall short
of, the latter equimultiples taken in corresponding
order.'
Perhaps the greatest tribute to this marvellous defini-
tion
is
its adoption by Weierstrass
as a
definition
of equal
numbers.
For
a
most
attractive
explanation
of
its
exact
significance and its absolute sufficiency the reader should turn
to De Morgan's articles on Ratio and Proportion in the Penny
Cyclopaedia.^
The definition (7) of greater ratio is an adden-
dum to Definition 5
:
' When, of the equimultiples, the multiple
of
the
first
exceeds
the
multiple
of
the
second,
but
the
multiple
of the third
does not
exceed
the
multiple
of
the
fourth,
then
the
first
is
said
to
have
a
greater
ratio
to
the second than the third has to the fourth
'
;
this
(possibly
for brevity's sake) states only one criterion, the other possible
criterion being that, while the multiple of the
first
is equal
to that of the second, the multiple of the third
is
less than
that
of the
fourth.
A proportion may
consist
of
three
or
four terms
(Defs. 8,9,10);
' corresponding
' or
' homologous
terms are antecedents in relation
to antecedents and
conse-
quents
in
relation
to consequents
(11).
Euclid proceeds
to
define
the
various
transformations
of
ratios.
Alternatiotu
{kvaXKd^,
alternando) means taking the
alternate
terms
in
the proportion a:h = c:d,\.e. transforming it into a:c = b:d
(12).
Inversion {dvdiraXiv, inversely) means turning the ratio
a:h into h:a (13).

is the turning

Separation,

into
{aâ€” h):h

Conversion,
dva-

(dvaa-TpeyjrayTi = convertendo) turns a:b into a:a~b
(16).
Lastly, ex aequali (sc. distantia), 8l
i'a-ov, and ex aequali
in disturbed proportion (eu reTapayfievrj duaXoyia) are defined
(17,
18).
If a:b = A:B,
b:c = B :â‚¬'... k:l = K
: L,
then
the inference ex aequali is that a:l = A:L (proved in V. 22).
If again a:b = B:G and b:c = A:B, the inference ex aequali
in disturbed p)ro2Mrtion is a:c = A:C (proved in V. 23).
In
reproducing
the
content
of
the Book
I
shall
express
magnitudes in general (which Euclid represents by straight
lines)
by the
letters
a,
b,
c...
and
I
shall
use the
letters
m,
n,
p) ...
to
express
integral numbers
:
thus ma, mb
are
equimultiples of a,
b.
The
first
six propositions are simple theorems in concrete
arithmetic, and they are practically
all proved by separating
into their units the multiples used.

proved by means

As a matter of
fact, Euclid
assumes the construction of a straight line equal to l/mth of
ma â€” mh.
This is an anticipation of VI.
9, but can be avoided
;
for we
can draw
a straight
line equal
to m{a â€” b)\
then,
by
1, m{a â€” b)+mb = m.a, or maâ€”inib = m{a â€” b).
(2.
7n,a + na+pa+ ... = {m,+ n +p+ ...)a.
(6.
ma â€” na={mâ€” n)a.
Euclid actually expresses
2 and 6 by saying that
iTia + na
is
the same multiple of a that mb + nb
is of
6.
By separation
of m, n into units he in fact shows (in 2) that
ma + na = {m + n) a, and
'tnb + nb =
(tji + n) b.
6 is proved by means of 2, as 5 by means of
1.

If m ,na, m.nb are equimultiples of na, nb, which are
themselves equimultiples of
a,
b, then m

magnitudes aâ€” b,

Take m such that

nc

multiple of c which

(ii)
since m6 >
c, we have similarly ma > nc.
In either case m,b < nc, since in case

Thus in either case, by the definition (7)
of greater ratio,
a:c > b:c,

c -.b > c:a.

Then
the same equimultiples mxi, mc of

Defs. 5 and 7 are used in succession.

If a:b â€” c:d, then, according as Â« > = < c, 6 > = < d.
The first case only is proved

' Similarly

If

But a:b := c: d, whence (13) c:d > c:b, an^ therefore (10)
b >d.

Dividing the multiples into
their
units, we have in equal
ratios a:b; the result follows by 12.
Propositions 16-19 prove certain cases of the transformation

we have

Take riia, mb, 'inc, md equimultiples of

It follows
(2) that
(m + n) b, {m+ ii)d are also equimultiples of b, d.
Therefore, since
a:b = c:d,
ma > =z <(m + n) b according as
inc > = <(m, + n) d.
(Def. 5)
Subtracting m6 from both sides of the former relation and
md from both sides of the latter, we have (5)
m{a~b) > = < nb according as m(c â€” cZ) > = < nd.
Therefore (Def.

a â€” b:b = c â€” d:d.

little, without altering the
substance.)

If
a:b = c:d,

Proved by

Euclid
assumes that
a + b:b = {c+d):(dÂ±x),
if
that
is
possible.
(This
implies
that to any three
given magnitudes, two of which
at
least
are of the same kind, there exists a fourth
proportional, an
assumption which is not strictly legitimate until the fact has
been proved by construction.)
Therefore, separando (17), a:b =
{c + x):{dÂ±x),
whence

{c + x): {dÂ±x) = c ul, which
relations
are

(a + b):c = {d + e) :/.
25.
If a:b = c:d, and of the four terms Â«
is the greatest
(so that d is also the least), a + d > b + c.
Since
a
: b = c
: d,
a â€” (:.:b â€” d â€” a:b;
(19)
and, since a > b,
{a â€” c)>
{h â€” d).
(16, 14)
Add
c + cZ to each
;
therefore
a + d > b + c.
Such slight
defects as are found in the text of this great
Book as
it has reached
us, like other slight imperfections of
form in the Elements, point to the probability that the work
never received its final touches from Euclid's hand
; but they
can all be corrected without much difficulty, as Simson showed
in his excellent edition.
Book VI contains the application to plane geometry of the
general theory of proportion established in Book V.
It begins
with definitions of
' similar rectilineal figures
' and of what is

383
EUCLID
meant by cutting a straight line
' in extreme and mean ratio
'.
The
first and last propositions are analogous;
1 proves that
triangles and
parallelograms of the same height are to one
another
as
their
bases, and
33
that
in equal
circles angles
at the centre or circumference are as the arcs on which they
stand;
both
use
the
method
of
equimultiples
and
apply
V,
Def.
5
as the
test of proportion.
Equally fundamental
are
2
(that two
sides
of a triangle cut by any parallel to
the third
side are divided proportionally, and the converse),
and 3 (that the internal bisector of an angle of a triangle cuts
the opposite side into parts which have the same ratio as the
sides
containing
the
angle, and
the
converse)
;
2
depends
directly on
1 and
3 on
2.
Then come the
alternative
con-
ditions for the similarity of two triangles
: equality of all the
angles
respectiveljr
(4),
proportionality
of
pairs
of
sides
in
order
(5), equality of one angle in each with proportionality
of sides containing the equal angles
(6), and the 'ambiguous
case
'
(7), in which one angle
is equal to one angle and the
sides about other angles are proportional.
After the important
proposition
(8) that
the perpendicular from the right angle
in a
right-angled
triangle
to
the
opposite
side
divides
the
triangle into two triangles similar to the original triangle and
to
one
another, we
pass
to
the
proportional
division
of
straight
lines
(9,
10) and
the
problems
of
finding a third
proportional to two straight lines
(11), a fourth proportional
to three
(12), and a mean proportional to two
straight
lines
(13, the Book VI version of
II. 14).
In
14, 15 Euclid proves
the
reciprocal
proportionality
of
the
sides about the equal
angles in parallelograms or triangles of equal area which have
one angle equal to one angle and the converse
; by placing the
equal angles vertically opposite to one another so that the sides
about them
lie along two straight lines, and completing the
figure, Euclid
is able to apply VI.
1.
From
14
are directly
deduced 16, 17 (that, if four or three straight lines be propor-
tionals, the rectangle contained by the extremes
is equal
to
the rectangle contained by the two means or the square on the
one mean, and the converse).
18-22 deal with similar recti-
lineal figures
;
19 (with Porism) and 20 are specially important,
proving that similar triangles, and similar polygons generally,
are

sides, and that,
if three straight lines are proportional, then,
as the first is to the thii'd, so is the figure described on the first
to the similar figure similarly described on the second.
The
fundamental case of the two similar triangles is prettily pro\'ed
thus.
The triangles being ABG, DEF, in which B, E are equal
angles and BG, EF corresponding
sides, find a third propor-
tional to BC, EF and measure it off" along BG as BG
; join AG.
Then the triangles ABG, DEF ha,ye their sides about the equal
angles B, E reciprocally proportional and are therefore equal
(VI.
15);
the
rest follows from VI.

definition of
duplicate ratio (V, Def.
9).
Proposition

(equiangular
parallelograms
have
to
one
another the
ratio compounded of the ratios of their
sides)
is
important in
itself, and also because
it introduces us to the
practical use of the method of compounding, i.e. multiplying,
ratios which
is
of
such extraordinarily wide application
in
Greek geometry.
Euclid has never defined
' compound ratio
or the
' compounding
' of ratios
; but the meaning of the terms

Therefore, ex uequall (V. 22),
{ABCD):{CEFG) = K:M.
The important Proposition 25 (to construct a rectilineal figure
similar to one, and equal to another, given rectilineal figure) is
one of the famous problems alternatively associated with the
story of Pythagoras's
sacrifice ^
;
it is doubtless Pythagorean.
The given figure
(P, say) to which the required figure is to be
similar is transformed (I. 44) into a p3,rallelogram on the same
base BC.
Then the other figure {Q, say) to which the required
figure
is
to be equal
is
(I. 45) transformed into a parallelo-
gram on the base OF (in a straight line with EG) and of equal
.
height with the other parallelogram.
Then (P)
: (Q) = BG:CF
(1).
It
is then
only
necessary to take a straight
line GH
a mean proportional between BG and GF, and to describe on
GH as base a rectilineal figure similar to P which has BG as
base (VI. 18).
The proof of the correctness of the construction
follows from VI. 19 Por.
In 27, 28, 29 we reach the final problems in the Pythagorean
application of areas, which are the geometrical equivalent of
the algebraical solution of the most general form of quadratic
equation where
that
equation has a
real and positive
root.
Detailed notice of these propositions
is necessary because of
their exceptional historic importance, which
arises from the
fact that the method of these propositions was constantly used
K
N
by the Greeks in the solution of problems.
They constitute,
for example, the foundation of Book X of the Elements and of

sections by
Apollonius.
The
problems themselves
are enunciated
in
28, 29
: 'To a given
straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to a given recti-
lineal figure and deficient (or exceeding) by a parallelogrammic
figure similar to a given parallelogram
'
; and 27 supplies
tlae
SLopiafios,
or
determination
of
the
condition
of
possibility,
which is necessary in the case of deficiency (28)
:
' The given
rectilineal figure must
(in that case) not be greater than the
parallelogram described on the
half of the straight line and
similar to the
defect.'
We will take the problem of 28
for
examination.
We
are
already
familiar with
the
notion of applying a
parallelogram
to a straight line AB
s,o that it falls short or
exceeds by a certain other parallelogram.
Suppose that B is
the given parallelogram to which the defect in this case has to
be similar.
Bisect AB in E, and on the half EB describe the
parallelogram GEBF
similar
and
similarly situated
to
D.
Draw
the
diagonal
GB
and
complete
the
parallelogram
HABF.
Now,
if we draw through any point T on HA
a
straight line TR parallel
to AB meeting the diagonal GB in
Q, and then draw PQS parallel to TA, the parallelogram TASQ
is
a
parallelogram
applied
to AB
but
falling
short by
a
parallelogram similar and similarly situated
to D, since the
deficient parallelogram is QSBR which
is similar to EF (24).
(In the same way, if T had been on HA 'produced and TR had
met GB 'produced in R, we should have had a parallelogram
applied
to AB but exceeding by a parallelogram similar and
similarly situated to D.)
Now consider the parallelogram AQ
falling short by 8R
similar and similarly situated to D.
Since {AO) = [ER), and
(OS) = (QF), it follows that the parallelogram AQ is equal to
the gnomon
TJWV,
and
the
problem
is
therefore that
of
constructing the gnomon UWV such that its area
is equal to
that of the given rectilineal figure C.
The gnomon obviously
cannot be greater than the parallelogram EF, and hence the
given
rectilineal
figure C must
not
be
greater
than
that
parallelogram.
This is the SiopLo-fios proved in 27.
Since the gnomon is equal to C, it follows that the parallelo-
gram GOQP which with it makes up the parallelogram EF is
equal
to the
difference between (EF) and
C.
Therefore, in

396
EUCLID
order to construct the required gnomon, we have only to draw
in the angle FGE the parallelogram GOQP equal to (EF) â€” C
and similar and similarly situated to D.
This is what Euclid
in fact does
; he constructs the parallelogram LKNM equal to
{EF) â€”
and similar and similarly situated to D (by means of
25), and then draws GOQP equal to
it.
The problem
is thus
solved, TASQ being the required parallelogram.
To show the correspondence
to the solution of a quadratic
equation, let AB = a, QS = x, and
let b:c be the ratio of the
sides of I)
;
therefore SB = -x.
Then, if m is a certain con-
c
stant (in fact the sine of an angle of one of the parallelograms),
(AQ) â€” m (ax â€”
-x''-), so that the equation solved is

Except in the respect that

to contain any matter
that was not known before Euclid's time.
Nor is the generali-
zation of

VI. 31,
for which Proclus
professes such
admiration, original on
Euclid's part, for, as we have already
seen
(p. 191), Hippocrates of Chios assumes its truth for semi-
circles described on the three sides of a right-angled triangle.
We pass to the arithmetical Books, \ll, VIII, IX.
Book VII
begins with a
set of
definitions
applicable
in
all the three
Books.
They include definitions of a unit, a number, and the
following varieties of numbers, even, odd, even-times-even, even-
times-odd, odd-times-odd, prime, p>rime
to one another, coni-
j)osite,
composite
to
one another,
plane,
solid, square,
cube,
similar plane
a.nd
solid
numbers,
and
a
perfect
number,
definitions of terms applicable in the numerical theory of pro-
portion, namely a part (= a
submultiple
or
aliquot
part),
parts {â€” a proper fraction), multiply, and finally the
defini-
tion of (four) proportional numbers, which states that
' num-
bers are proportional when the first is the same multiple, the
same part, or the same parts, of the second that the third is of
the fourth
',
i.e. numbers
a, h,
c, d are proportional
if, when
C6 = â€” b, c = â€” d, where m, n are any integers (although the
definition does not in terms cover the case where m > n).
The propositions of Book VII fall into four main groups.
1-3 give the method of
finding the greatest common mea-
sure of two or three unequal numbers in essentially the same
form
in which
it appears
in our text-books. Proposition
1
giving the
test for two numbers being prime to one another,
namely that no remainder measures
the preceding quotient
till
1
is
reached.
The
second
group,
4-19,
sets
out
the
numerical theory of proportion.
4-10 are preliminary, deal-
ing with numbers which are
' a part
' or
' parts
' of other num-
bers, and numbers which
are
the same
' part
' or
' parts
' of
other numbers, just as the preliminary propositions of Book V

398
EUCLID
deal with multiples and equimultiples.
11-14 are transforma-
tions of proportions corresponding to similar transformations
{separando, alternately, &c.)
in Book V.
The following are
the results, expressed with the aid of letters which here repre-
sent integral numbers exclusively.
If
a:h = c:d
{a >
c.
h > d),
then
{a-c):{'b-d) = a:h.
(11)
If a:a' = h:h' = c:c' ..., then each of the ratios is equal to
{a + h + c-Â¥...):{a' + h' + c' +...).
(12)
If
a:b = c:d,
then
a:c â€” h:d.
(13)
If
a:b â€” d:e
and
b:c = e:f,
then, ex aequali,
a:c = d:f.
(14)
If
1
: m = a
: ma
(expressed
by
saying
that
the
third
number measures the fourth the same number of times that
the unit measures the second), then alternately
1 :a = mima.
(15)
The
last
result
is used
to prove
that
ah = ba\
in
other
words, that the order of multiplication
is indifferent (16), and
this
is followed by
the
propositions
that
b:c = ab:ac
(17)
and that a:b = ac:bc
(18), which
are
again
used
to prove
the
important
proposition
(19)
that,
if
a:b=c:d,
then
ad = be, a theorem which corresponds to VI. 16 for straight
lines.
Zeuthen observes that, while
it was necessary to use the
numerical
definition
of â€¢ proportion
to
carry
the
numerical
theory up to this point. Proposition
1 9 establishes the necessary
point
of
contact between
the two
theories,
since
it
is now
shown that
the
definition
of
proportion
in V,
Def.
5,
has,
when
applied
to numbers, the same import as that in VII,
Def. 20, and we can henceforth without hesitation borrow any
of the propositions established in Book V.^
Propositions 20, 21 about 'the least numbers of those which
have the same ratio with them
' prove that, if
7n, n are such
numbers and
a, b any other numbers
in the same
ratio, m

measures a the same number of times that n measures b, and
that numbers prime to one another are the least of those which
have the same ratio with them.
These propositions lead up to
Propositions 22-32 about numbers prime to one another, prime
numbers, and composite numbers.
This group includes funda-
mental theorems such as the following.
If two numbers be
prime to any number, their product will be prime to the same
(24).
If. two numbers be prime to one another, so will their
squares, their cubes, and so on generally (27).
If two numbers
be prime
to one another,
their sum
will be prime
to
each
of them;
and,
if the sum
be prime
to
either, the
original
numbers will be prime to one another (28).
Any prime number
is prime to any number which it does not measure (29).
If two
numbers are multiplied, and any prime number measures the
product,
it
will measure
one
of
the
original numbers
(30).
Any composite number
is measured by some prime number
(31).
Any number either
is prime or
is measured by some
prime number (32).
Propositions 33 to the end (39) are directed to the problem
of finding the least common multiple of two or three numbers
;
33 is prehminary, using the G. C. M. for the purpose of solving
the problem,
' Given as many numbers as we please, to find the
least of those which have the same ratio with them.'
It seems
clear
that
in
Book VII
Euclid was
following
earlier models, while no doubt making improvements in the
exposition.
This is, as we have seen (pp. 215-16), partly con-
firmed by the
fact
that
in
the proof by Archytas
of
the
proposition
that 'no number
can
be a mean between two
consecutive numbers
' propositions are presupposed correspond-
ing to VII. 20, 22, 33.
Book VIII deals largely with
series of numbers
' in con-
tinued proportion
', i. e. in geometrical progression (Propositions
1-3, 6-7, 13).
If the series in G. P. be
a", aÂ»-i6,
a"-262, ...
a26"-^
ab'^-'',
6",
Propositions 1-3
deal with the case where the terms are the
smallest that are
in the
ratio a
: b,
in- which case
a", 6" are
prime to one another.
6-7 prove that, if a" does not measure
a'^-'^b, no term measures any
other, but
if a" measures
i",
it measures a"" ^6.
Connected with theseare Propositions 14-17

400
EUCLID
proving
that,
according as a^ does or does not measure
o
,
a does or does not measure
h and vice versa; and similarly,
according as a^ does or does not measure Â¥, a does or does not
measure
h and vice versa.
13 proves that, if a,
6, c
... are in
G. P., so are
a^,
b'^, c^ ... and
a^, b^, c^ ...
respectively.
Proposition 4
is the problem, Given as many ratios as we
please,
a:b,
c:d...
to find a
series p,
q,
r,
...
in the least
possible terms such that p
: g = a
: &, q:r â€” c:cl, â€”
This is
done by finding the L. C. M.,
first of
b, c, and then of other
pairs
of numbers
as
required.
The
proposition
gives
the
means of compounding two or more ratios between numbers
in the same way that ratios between pairs of straight
lines
are compounded in VI.
23
; the corresponding proposition to
VI.
23
then
follows
(5), namely, that plane numbers have
to one another the
ratio compounded of the
ratios of
their
sides.
Propositions 8-10 deal with the interpolation of geometric
means
between
numbers.
If a
: 6 = e :/,
and
there
are
)i,
geometric means
between a and
b,
there
are n geometric
means between e and/ also (8).
If
a", a"~^ b
... a 6"^^, 6" is a
G. P. of
it + 1 terms, so that there are {n â€”
1) means between
a", b", there are the same number of geometric means between
1 and
a" and between
1 and
fo" respectively
(9);
and con-
versely,
if
1, o, a^ ... a" and
1,
b, b^ ... 6" are terms in G. P.,
there are the same number {n â€” 1) of means between a", 6" (10).
In particular, there is one mean proportional number between
square numbers (11) and between similar plane numbers (18),
and conversely, if there is one mean between two numbers, the
numbers are similar plane numbers (20)
; there are two means
between cube numbers (12) and between similar solid numbers
(19), and conversely, if there are two means between two num-
bers, the numbers are similar solid numbers (21).
So far as
squares and cubes are concerned, these propositions are stated by
Plato in the Timaeus, and Nicomachus, doubtless for this reason,
calls them
' Platonic
'.
Connected with them are the proposi-
tions that similar plane numbers have the same ratio as a square
has to a square (26), and similar solid numbers have the same
ratio
as a cube has to a cube (27).
A few other subsidiary
propositions need no particular mention.
Book IX begins with seven simple propositions such as that

THE ELEMENTS.
BOOK IX
401
the product of two similar plane numbers is a square (1) and,
if the product of two numbers
is a square number, the num-
bers are similar plane numbers (2)
;
if a cube multiplies itself
or another cube,
the
product
is a cube
(3,
4);
if a^^
is a
cube, B
is a cube (5)
;
if A^ is a cube, J. is a cube
(6).
Then
follow six propositions (8-13) about a series of terms in geo-
metrical progression beginning with
1.
If
1, a, 6, c ...
/c are
n terms in geometrical progression, then (9), if a
is a square
(or a
cube),
all
the
other terms
h,
c,
...
k are squares
(or
cubes)
;
if a is not a square, then the only squares in the series
are the term after a,
i. e. b, and all alternate terms after b
;
if
a
is not a cube, the only cubes
in the series are the fourth
term
(c), the seventh, tenth, &c., terms, being terms separated
by two throughout
; the seventh, thirteenth, &c., terms (leaving
out
five
in each
case)
will be both square and cube
(8, 10).
These propositions are followed by
the interesting theorem
that, ii
1, a^, a^ ... a,^ ... are terms in geometrical progression,
and if a^, aâ€ž are any two terms where r<n,
a.^ measures
Â«â€ž,
and aâ€ž = aj..aâ€ž_^ (11 and For.)
;
this
is, of course, equivalent
to the formula aâ„¢+" =
a."*, a".
Next
it
is proved that, if the
last term k in a series l,a,b,c
... k in geometrical progression
is measured by any primes, a is measured by the same (12)
;
and, if a
is prime, k will not be measured by any numbers
except those which have a place in the series (13).
Proposi-
tion 14
is
the
equivalent of the important theorem
that a
nwmber can only be resolved into prime factors in one way.
Propositions follow to the effect that,
if 'a, b be prime to one
another, there can be no integral third proportional to them
(16) and, if a,b,c ...k be in G. P. and a,k are prime
to one
another, then there is no integral fourth proportional to a, b, k
(17).
The conditions for the
possibility of an integral third
proportional to two numbers and of an integral fourth propor-
tional to three are then investigated (18,
19).
Proposition 20
is the important proposition that the number ofprim,e nuTnbers
is infinite, and the proof is the same as that usually given in
our algebraical text-books.
After a number of easy proposi-
tions
about
odd,
even,
' even-times-odd
',
' even-times-even
numbers respectively (Propositions
21-34), we have two im-
portant propositions which conclude the Book.

of Pappus goes on
to speak of the
share of Euclid
in the
investigation
:
' As for Euclid, he set himself to give rigorolis rules, which he
established, relative to commensurability and incommensura-
bility
in general
; he made
precise the
definitions and the
distinctions between rational and irrational magnitudes, he set
out a great number of orders of
irrational magnitudes, and
finally he made clear their whole extent.'
As usual, Euclid begins with definitions.
' Commensurable
magnitudes can be measured by one and the same measure
;
'incommensurable*
magnitudes
cannot
have
any common
measure
(l).
Straight
lines are
' commensurable
in square
when the squares on them can be measured by the same area,
but
' incommensurable
in square
' when the squares on them
have no common measure
(2).
Given an assigned straight
line, which we agree to call
' rational
', any straight line which
is commensurable with it either in length or in square only is
also called rational
; but any straight line which is incommen-
surable with it (i.e. not commensurable with it either in length
or in square) is 'irrational' (3).
The square on the assigned
straight line
is
' rational
', and any area commensurable with
it
is
' rational
', but any
area incommensurable with
it
is
'irrational', as
also
is the side of the square equal
to that
area (4).
As regards straight
lines, then, Euclid here takes
a wider view of 'rational' than we have met
before.
If
a
straight
line p
is assumed
as
rational, not only
is â€” p also
' rational
' where m, n are integers and m/ft in its lowest terms
is not square, but any straight line is rational which is either
commensurable
in

The Book begins with the famous proposition, on which the
' method of exhaustion
' as used in Book XII depends, to the
effect that,
if from any magnitude there be subtracted more
than its half (or its half simply), from the remainder more than
its half (or its half), and so on continually, there will at length
remain a magnitude less than any assigned magnitude of the
same kind.
Proposition
2
uses the process
for finding the
G. C. M. of two magnitudes as a test of their commensurability
or incommensurability: they are incommensurable if the process
never comes to an end, i.e. if no remainder ever measures the
preceding
divisor; and
Propositions
3,
4 apply to commen-
surable magnitudes the method of finding the G. C. M. of two
or three numbers as employed in VII.
2,
3.
Propositions
5
to 8 show that two magnitudes are commensurable or incom-
mensurable according as they have or have not to one another
the ratio of one number to another, and lead up to the funda-
mental proposition
(9)
of Theaetetus already quoted, namely
that the
sides of squares are commensurable or incommen-
surable in length according as the squares have or have not to
one another the ratio of a square number to a square number,
and conversely.
Propositions 11-16 are easy inferences as to
the
commensurability
or incommensurability of magnitudes
from the known
relations
of
others connected with them;
e. g. Proposition
1 4 proves that, if a:b = C:d, then, according
as
\/(a^ â€” 6^)
is commensurable or incommensurable with
a.
^((?â€”d?)
is
commensurable
or
incommensurable
with
c.
Following on
this. Propositions 17, 18 prove that the roots of
the quadratic equation
aicâ€” a;^ = 6^/4 are commensurable or
incommensui-able with a according as
-/(a^ â€” h''-)
is commen-
surable or incommensurable with a.
Propositions 19-21 deal
with
rational
and
irrational
rectangles,
the
former
being
contained by straight lines commensurable in length, whereas
rectangles contained by straight lines commensurable in square
only are irrational.
The side of a square equal to a rectangle
of the latter kind is called medial
;
this is the first in Euclid's
classification of irrationals.
As the sides of the rectangle may
be expressed as
p, pVk, where p
is a rational straight
line,
the medial is k^p.
Propositions 23-8 relate to medial straighf
lines and rectangles
; two medial straight lines may be eithei
commensurable in length or commensurable
in square only

thus
k'-p and Xh^p are commensurable
in
length, while k^p
and V X
. k^p are commensurable in square only
: the rectangles
formed by such
pairs
are
in
general
medial,
as
Xk^p"^ and
V X
. k^p"^
; but if -/x = hWk in the second case, the rectangle
(k'kp^) is rational (Propositions 24, 25).
Pi-oposition 26 proves
that
the
difference
between
two
medial
areas
cannot
be
rational
;
as any two medial
areas can be expressed
in the
form vk
. p^, VX
. p^, this is equivalent to proving, as we do in
algebra,
that
( V/c â€” VX)
cannot
be
equal
to
k'.
Finally,
Propositions 2 7, 28 find medial straight
lines commensurable
in square only (1) which contain a rational rectangle, viz. kip,
kip, and (2) which contain a medial rectangle, viz. kip,Xip/ki.
It
should be observed that, as p may take either of the forms a
or VA, a medial straight line may take the alternative forms
V{a VB) or V{AB), and the pairs of medial straight lines just
mentioned may take respectively the forms

Propositions 42-7 prove that each of the above straight lines,
made up of the sttm of two terms, is divisible into its terms
in only one way.
In particular, Proposition 42
proves the
equivalent of the well-known theorem in algebra that,
if
a + Vh = x+ Vy, then a = x,
b = y;
and if
â€¢
Va + -/& = Vx + Vy,
then
a = X,
b = y
(or a= y,
b = x).
Propositions 79-84 prove corresponding facts in regard to
the corresponding irrationals with the negative sign between
the terms:
in particular Proposition 79 shows that,
if
aâ€” Vb â€” Xâ€” Vy, then a = x,
b â€” y;
and if
Vaâ€” Vb â€” Vxâ€” Vy, then a = x,
b = y.
The next
sections
of
the Book
deal with binomials and
apotomes classified according to the relation of their terms to
another given
i-ational straight

The next sets of propositions (54-65 and 91-102) prove the
connexion between the first set of irrationals {A^, J.2 ... i^,
, -^2)
and the second set
((Xj, ag.-- ^1, ^2) respectively.
It is shown
e.g., in Proposition
54, that the side of a square equal to the
rectangle contained by p and the first binomial cKj is a binomial
of the type A-^, and the same thing is proved in Proposition 91
for the first apotome.
In fact
y{/)(A;p + fcpymr^)}=py{|/c(l+X)} +p/{|/c(l-A)}.
Similarly
-/(p/Sj), V(p^^
are irrationals
of the type B^, B^
respectively, and so on.
Conversely, the square on A^or A^,^ applied as a rectangle
to a rational straight line
(o-, say), has for its breadth a binomial
or apotome of the types
a.^,
(x,^ respectively (60, 97).

Propositions
66-70
and
Propositions
103-7
prove
that
straight

respectively are irrationals of the same type and order.
Propositions
71,

108-10
show
that
the
irrationals
-4j, ^2
Fj, F^ arise
severally as the sides of squares equal
to the sum or difference of a rational and a medial area, or the
sum or difference of two medial
areas incommensurable with
one another.
Thus
Icp'^ + -/A
. p" is the sum or difference of a
rational and a
medial
area, Vk. p^Â± '/X
.
p'^
is
the sum
or
difference
of two
medial

incommensurable with
one
another provided that Vk and -/X are incommensurable, and
the propositions prove that
V{kp^ + a/X
. p-) and V( Vk.p^Â±VX. p^)
take one or other of the forms A-^, A^... F^, F^ according to
the
different
possible
relations
between
k,
X and
the
sign
separating the two terms, but no othei* forms.
Finally, it is proved at the end of Proposition 72, in Proposi-
tion 111 and
the explanation following
it that the thirteen
irrational
straight
lines,
the
medial and
the
twelve other
irrationals A-^, A,^... F^^,F^, are all different from one another.
E.g. (Proposition 111) a binomial straight line cannot also be
an apotome
;
in
other
words, Vx + Vy cannot be equal to
Vx' â€” Vy', and x + Vy
cannot
be
equal
to
x' â€” Vy'.
We
prove the latter proposition by squaring, and
Euclid's proce-
dure corresponds exactly to this.
Propositions 112-14 prove
that, if a rectangle equal to the square on a rational straight
line be applied to a binomial, the other side containing it is an
apotome of the same order, with terms commensurable with
those of the binomial and in the same ratio, and vice versa
also that a binomial and apotome of the same order and with
terms commensurable respectively contain a rational rectangle.

Take

I have described the contents of Book X
at length because
it
is probably not well known to mathematicians, while
it is
geometrically very remarkable and very finished.
As regards
its object Zeuthen has a remark which, I
think, mu.st come
very near the
truth.
' Since such
roots of equations of the
second degree as are incommensurable with the given magni-
tudes cannot be expressed by means of the latter and of num-
bers, it is conceivable that the Greeks, in exact investigations,
introduced no approximate values, but worked on with the
magnitudes
they
had
found,
which
were
represented
by
straight lines obtained by the construction corresponding
to
the solution of the equation.
That
is exactly the same thing
which happens when we do not evaluate
roots
but content
ourselves with expressing them by
radical
signs and other
algebraical symbols.
But, inasmuch as one straight line looks
like another, the Greeks did not get the same
clear view of
what they denoted
(i. e. by simple inspection)
as our system
of symbols assures to us.
For this reason then it was neces-
sary to undertake a classification of the irrational magnitudes
which had been arrived at by successive solutions of equations
of the second
degree.'
That is, Book X formed a repository
of results to which could be referred problems depending on
the
solution
of
certain
types
of
equations,

EUCLID
Euclid himself, in Book XIII, makes considerable use of the
second part of Book X dealing with a'potomes
; he regards a
straight line as sufficiently defined in character
if he can say
that it is, e.g., an a'potorme (XIII.
17), & first apotome (XIII. 6),
a minor straight line (XIII. 11).
So does Pappus.^
Our description of Books XI-XIII can be shorter.
They
deal with
geometry
in
three
dimensions.
The
definitions,
belonging to all three Books, come at the beginning of Book XI.
They include those of a straight line, or a plane, at right angles
to a plane, the inclination of a plane to a plane (dihedral angle),
parallel planes, equal and
similar
solid
figures,
solid
angle,
pyramid, prism, sphere, cone, cylinder and parts of them, cube,
octahedron, icosahedron and dodecahedron.
Only the
definij
tion of the sphere needs
special mention.
Whereas
it had
previously been defined as the figure which has
all points of
its surface equidistant from
its centre, Euclid, with an eye to
his use of
it in Book XIII to
' comprehend
' the regular solids
in a sphere, defines it as the figure comprehended by the i-evo-
lution of a semicii'cle about its diameter.
The
propositions
of
Book
XI
are
in
their
order
fairly
parallel to those of Books I and VI on plane geometry.
First
we have propositions that a straight line
is wholly in a plane
if a portion of
it is in the plane (1), and that two intersecting
straight
lines, and
a
triangle,
are
in one
plane
(2).
Two
intersecting planes cut in a straight line
(3).
Straight lines
perpendicular to planes are next dealt with
(4-6,
8, 11-14^,
then parallel straight lines not all in the same plane (9, 10, 15),
parallel planes
(14,
16), planes at right angles to one another
(18, 19), solid angles contained by three angles (20, 22, 23, 26)
or by more angles
(21).
Thl rest of the Book deals mainly
with parallelepipedal
solids.
It
is only necessary to mention
the more important propositions.
Parallelepipedal solids on the
same base or equal bases and between the same parallel planes
(i.e. having the same
height)
are
equal
(29-31).
Parallele-
pipedal solids of the same height are to one another as their
bases
(32).
Similar parallelepipedal
solids are in the
tripli-
cate
ratio
of
corresponding
sides
(33).
In
equal
parallele-
pipedal solids the bases are reciprocally proportional to their
heights and conversely (34).
If four straight lines be propor-

413
tional,
so
are
parallelepipedal
solids
similar
and
similarly
described upon
them,
and
conversely
(37).
A
few
other
propositions are only inserted
because
they are
required
as
lemmas in later books, e.g.
tlftit, if a cube is
bisected by two
planes each of which is parallel to a pair of opposite faces, the
common section
of the two planes and the diameter of the
cube bisect one another (38).
The main
feature of Book XII
is
the application of the
method of exhaustion, which is used to prove successively that
circles are to one another
as the squares on their diameters
(Propositions 1,2), that pyramids of the same height and with
triangular bases are
to one another as the bases
(3-.5), that
any cone
is, in content, one third part of the cylinder which
has the same base with
it and equal height
(10), that cones
and cylinders of the same height are to one another as their
bases (11), that similar cones and cylinders are to one another
in the triplicate ratio of the diameters of their bases (12), and
finally that spheres are to one another in the
triplicate ratio
of their respective diameters (16-18).
Propositions 1, 3-4 and
16-17 are of course preliminary to the main propositions 2, 5
and 18
respectively.
Proposition 5
is extended
to pyramids
with polygonal bases in Proposition
6.
Proposition 7 proves
that any prism with
triangular bases
is divided
into
three
pyramids with triangular bases and equal in content, whence
any pyramid with triangular
base (and
therefore
also any
pyramid with polygonal
base)
is equal
to one third part of
the prism having the same base and equal height.
The rest
of the Book
consists of propositions about pyramids, cones,
and cylinders similar
to those
in Book XI about parallele-
pipeds and in Book VI about parallelograms
:
similar pyra-
mids with triangular bases, and therefore also similar pyramids
with polygonal bases, are in the triplicate ratio of correspond-
ing sides (8)
;
in equal pyramids, cones and cylinders the bases
are
reciprocally proportional to the
heights, and conversely
(9, 15)!
The method of exhaustion, as applied in Euclid, rests upon
X.
1 as lemma, and no doubt it will be desirable to insert here
an example of its use.
An interesting case is that relating to
the pyramid.
Pyramids with triangular bases and of the same
height, says Euclid, are to one another as their bases (Prop.
5).

414
EUCLID
It
is
first proved (Proposition 3) that, given any pyramid, as
ABGD, on the base BCD,
if we bisect the six edges at the
points E, F, G, H, K, L, and draw the straight lines shown in
the
figure, we
divide
the
pyramid ABGD
into
two
equal
prisms and two equal pyramids AFGE, FBHK similar to the
original pyramid
(the
equality
of
the
prisms
is proved
in
XI.
39), and that the sum of the two prisms
is greater than
half the original pyramid.
Proposition 4 proves that, if each
of two given pyramids of the same height be so divided, and
if the small pyramids in each are similarly divided, then the
smaller pyramids
left over from
that
division
are similarly
divided, and so on to any extent, the sums of all the pairs of
prisms in the two given pyramids respectively will be to one
another as the respective bases.
Let the two pyramids and
their volumes be denoted by P, P' respectively, and their bases
by B, B' respectively.
Then, if B:B' is not equal to P
: P', it
must be equal to P
: IT, where W is some volume either less or
greater than P'.
I. Suppose W < P'.
By X.
1 we can divide P' and the successive pyramids in
it
into
prisms
and
pyramids
until
the sum
of
the
small
pyramids left over in it is less that P' â€” W, so that
P' > (prisms in P') > W.
Suppose this done, and P divided similarly.
Then (XII. 4)
(sum of prisms in P)
: (sum of prisms in P') â€” B
: B'
= P:W,hy hypothesis.
But P > (sum of prisms in P)

But W is also less than the sum of the prisms in P'
: which
is impossible.
Therefore W is not less than P'.
II. Suppose
W > P'.
We have, inversely,
E:B=W:P
= P'
V, where V is some solid less than P.
But this can be proved impossible, exactly as in Part I.
Therefore W is neither greater nor less than
P', so that
-B:5'=P:P'.
We shall see, when we come to Archimedes, that he extended
this method of exhaustion.
Instead of merely taking the one
approximation, from underneath as
it were, by constructing
successive
figures within the
figure
to be measured and
so
exhausting
it, he combines with this an approximation from
outside.
He takes
sets both of inscribed and circumscribed
figures, approaching from both sides the figure to be measured,
and, as it were, com2'>resses them into one, so that they coincide
as nearly as we please with one another and with the curvi-
linear figure itself.
The two parts of the proof are accordingly
separate in Archimedes, and the second is not merely a reduction
to the first.
The object of Book XIII is to construct, and to
' comprehend
in a
sphere', each
of
the
five regular
solids,
the
pyramid
(Prop.
13),
the octahedron
(Prop.
14), the
cube
(Prop.
15),
the icosahedron
(Prop.
1 6) and the dodecahedron (Prop.
1 7)
;
' comprehending in a sphere
' means the construction
of the
circumscribing
sphere, which
involves
the determination
of
the relation of a
' side
'
(i. e. edge) of the solid to the radius
of the sphere
; in the case of the first three solids the relation
is actually determined, while in the case of the icosahedron
the side
of the figure
is shown to be the irrational straight
line called
' minor ', and in the case of the dodecahedron an
'apotome'.
The propositions
at the beginning
of the Book
are preliminary.
Propositions 1-6 are theorems about straight
lines cut in extreme and mean ratio, Propositions
7, 8 relate
to pentagons, and Proposition
8 proves that,
if, in a regular
pentagon, two diagonals (straight lines joining angular points

416
EUCLID
next but one to each other) are drawn intersecting at a point,
each of them
is divided
at the point
in extreme and mean
ratio, the greater segment being equal to the side of the pen-
tagon.
Propositions 9 and
1
relate to the sides of a pentagon,
a decagon and a hexagon
all
inscribed
in
the same
circle,
and are preliminary to proving (in Prop. 11) that the side of
the inscribed pentagon
is, in relation to the diameter of the
circle, regarded as rational, the irrational straight line called
' minor
'".
If p, d,
It
be
the
sides of the regular pentagon,
decagon, and hexagon inscribed in the same circle, Proposition 9
proves that h + d\& cut in extreme and mean ratio, h being the
greater segment
;
this is equivalent to saying that (r + d) d=r^,
where r is the radius of
the
circle, or, in other words, that
d = ^r(-</5â€”l).
Proposition
10
proves that 'p^^h^ + d"^ or
r^ + <i", whence we obtain p â€” |r\/(10â€” 2 \/5).
Expressed as
a
' minor
' irrational straight line, which Proposition
1 1 shows
it to be, |3 = i?V(5 + 2 V5) - -Ir l/{5 - 2 a/s).
The constructions for the several
solids, which have to be
inscribed in a given sphere, may be briefly indicated, thus
:
1. The regular pyramid or tetrahedron.
Given D, the diameter of the sphere which
is
to circum-
scribe the tetrahedron, Euclid draws a
circle with
radius r
such
that
7'2 = ,|Z)
. |D,
or
r = -|-/2.D,
inscribes an
equi-
lateral triangle in the circle, and then erects from the centre
of
it a straight line perpendicular to its plane and of length
fD.
The lines joining the extremity of the perpendicular to
the angular points of the
equilateral triangle determine the
tetrahedron.
Each
of the upstanding edges
{x, say)
is such
that x^ â€”
r'^ + %D'^ = 3r^ and it has been proved (in XIII. 12)
that the square on the side of the triangle inscribed in the
circle
is
also
Zr^-
Therefore the edge a of the tetrahedron
= v'3.r = ^v/6.D.
2. The octahedron.
If D be the diameter of the circumscribing sphere, a square
is inscribed
in a circle of
diameter D, and from
its
centre
straight
lines are drawn
in both directions perpendicular
tc
its plane and of length equal to the radius of the circle or hall
the diagonal of the square.
Each of the edges which stand up
from the square = V 2
. ^D, which
is equal
to the side of the

THE ELEMENTS.
BOOK
XIII
417
square.
Each of the edges a of the octahedron
is therefore
equal to ^2
. ^D.
3. The cube.
D being
the diameter of the circumscribing sphere, draw
a square with side a such that 0^=0. ^D, and describe a cube
on this square as base.
The edge a = ^Vz .D.
4. The icosahedron.
Given D, the diameter of the sphere, construct a circle with
radius
r such
that
r^ â€” D
. |Z).
Inscribe
in
it
a
regular
decagon.
Draw from its angular points straight lines perpen-
dicular
to the plane of the
circle and equal in length
to
its
radius r; this
determines
the
angular
points
of
a
regular
decagon
inscribed
in an
equal
parallel
circle.
By joining
alternate angular points of one of the decagons,
describe a
regular pentagon in the circle circumscribing it, and then do
the same in the other circle but so that the angular points are
not opposite those of the other pentagon.
Join the angular
points of one pentagon to the nearest angular points of the
other
;
this gives ten triangles.
Then, if p be the side of each
pentagon, d
the
side
of each decagon, the upstanding sides
of
the
triangles
(=
a;, say)
are
given by x^=d^ + r^=p^
(Prop. 10); therefore
the ten
triangles
are
equilateral.
We
have lastly to find the common vertices of the five equilateral
triangles standing on the pentagons and completing the icosa-
hedron.
If
C, C be the centres of the parallel
circles, GC is
produced
in both
directions
to Z,
.^
respectively
so
that
GX = C'Z = d
(the
side
of
the
decagon).
Then again
the
upstanding edges connecting to X, Z the angular points of the
two pentagons respectively
{â€” x, say) are given by
^2 _
,,2 ^ (p _ ^f._
Hence each of the edges
a = |j = f/V(10-2v/5) = ^g 7(10-2 v/5)
= ^\DV{10{&-V5)].
It
is
finally
shown
that
the
sphere
described
on XZ
as
diameter circumscribes the icosahedron, and
XZ= r + 2d = r + r (7.5-1) = r. ^5 = D.

5. The dodecahedron.
We start with the cube inscribed in the given sphere witl
diameter D.
We then draw pentagons which have the edge,
of the cube as diagonals in the manner shown in the figure

be the middle points of the
sides of the

Lastly, "it
is proved
that the same sphere
of diameter D
which circumscribes the cube also circumscribes the dodeca-
hedron.
For example, if Z is the centre of the sphere,

Book XIII ends with Proposition
18, which arranges the
edges of the five regular solids inscribed in one and the same
sphere in order of magnitude, while an addendum proves that
no other regular solid figures except the five exist.
,
The so-caHed Books XIV, XV.
This
is no doubt the place
to speak of the continuations
of Book XIII which used to be known as Books XIV, XV of
the Elements, though they are
not by
Euclid.
The former
is the work of Hypsicles, who probably lived in the second
half of the second century B.C., and who
is otherwise known
as
the
reputed author of an astronomical
tract
jii/ac^opiKos
(De ascensionihus) still extant (the earliest extant Greek book
in which the division of the circle into 360 degrees appears),
besides other works, which have not survived, on the harmony
of
the
spheres and on polygonal numbers.
The preface
to
' Book XIV
'
is
interesting
historically.
It
appears
from
it
that ApoUonius wrote
a
tract on
the comparison of the
dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in one and the same
sphere, i.e. on the ratio between them, and that there were two
editions
of
this work, the
first of which was in some way
incorrect, while the second gave a correct proof of the pro-
position
that,
as
the
surface
of
the
dodecahedron
is
to
the surface of the icosahedron, so
is the solid content of the
Ee 3

420
EUCLID
dodecahedron
to
that
of
the icosahedron,
' because the
pe
pendicular from the centre of the sphere to the pentagon
i
the dodecahedron and to the triangle of the icosahedron is tl
same
'.
Hypsicles says also that Aristaeus, in a work entitle
Comparison of the five figures, proved that 'the same
cire
circumscribes both the pentagon of the dodecahedron and tl
triangle
of
the
icosahedron inscribed
in
the same
sphere
whether
this Aristaeus
is the same as the Aristaeus of
tl
Solid
Loci,
the
elder
contemporary
of
Euclid, we
do
nc
know.
The proposition of Aristaeus
is proved by Hypsicl(
as Proposition
2
of his book.
The following
is a summar
of the results obtained by Hypsicles.
In a lemma at the
en
he proves that,
if two straight lines be cut in extreme an
mean
ratio, the segments
of both are in one and the
sarc
ratio;
the
ratio
is in fact 2:('/5 â€” 1).
If then any
straigl
line AB be divided at C in extreme and mean ratio, AC bein
the greater segment, Hypsicles proves that, if we have a cub
a dodecahedron and an icosahedron
all inscribed in the sam
sphere, then
:
(Prop.
7)
(side of cube)
: (side of icosahedron)
= ViAB-^ + AC): ViAB-' + BC^);
(Prop.
6)
(surface of dodecahedron)
: (surface of icosahedron)
= (side of cube)
: (side of icosahedron]
(Prop. 8)
(content of dodecahedron)
: (content of icosahedron)
= (surface of dodecahedron)
: (surface of icosahedron)
and consequently
(content of dodecahedron)
: (content of icosahedron)
= V{AB^ + AC'-):V(AB^ + BG^
The second of the two supplementary Books
(' Book XV ')
i
also concerned with the regular solids, but is much inferior
t
the
first.
The
exposition leaves much
to
be
desired,
bein
in some
places
obscure, in
others actually
inaccurate.
Th

The second
portion
^
explauis how to calculate the number of edges and the number
of
solid
angles
in
the
five
solids
respectively.
The
third
portion ^ shows how to determine the dihedral angles between
the faces meeting in any edge of any one of the solids.
The
method is to construct an isosceles triangle with vertical angle
equal to the said angle
; from the middle point of any edge
two perpendiculars are drawn to
it, one in each of the two
faces intersecting in that edge
; these perpendiculars (forming
the dihedral angle) are used
to determine the two equal sides
of an isosceles triangle, and the base of the triangle
is easily
found from the known properties of the particular solid.
The
rules for drawing the
respective
isosceles
triangles
are
first
given
all together in general terms
; and the special interest
of the passage consists in the fact that the rules are attributed
to
' Isidorus our great teacher
'.
This Isidorus
is doubtless
Isidorus of Miletus, the architect of the church of Saint Sophia
at Constantinople (about a.D. 532).
Hence the third portion
of the Book at
all events was written
Ijy a pupil of Isidorus
in the sixth century.
The Data.
Coming now
to the other works
of
Euclid, we will begin
with those which have actually survived.
Most closely con-
nected with the Elewients as dealing with plane geometry, the
subject-matter of Books I-VI, is the Data, which
is accessible
in
the Heiberg-Menge
edition
of the Greek
text, and
also
in the translation annexed by Simson
to
his edition of the
Elements
(although
this
translation
is based on an
inferior
text).
The book was
regarded
as important enough
to
be
included in the Treasury of Analysis (tottos dvaXvo/xifos)
as
known to Pappus, and Pappus gives a description of
it
; the
description shows that there were differences between Pappus's
text and ours, for, though Propositions 1-62 correspond to the
description, as also do Propositions 87-94
relating
to
circles
it the end
of the book, the intervening propositions do not

v, pp. 48-50.

422
EUCLID
exactly agree, the differences, however, affecting the
distribi
tion and numbering
of
the
propositions
rather than
the
substance.
The book
begins with
definitions
of the
senS'
in which things are said to be given.
Things such as area
straight
lines,
angles and
ratios
are
said
to
be
' given
:
magnitude when we can make others equal to them.' (Dei
1-2).
Rectilineal
figures
are 'given in
species' when the
angles are severally given as well as the ratios of the sides
one
another
(Def.
3).
Points,
lines and
angles
are
'give
in position
'
' when they always occupy the same place
'
: a n(
very illuminating definition (4).
A circle is given in positic
and in magnitude when the centi-e
is given in position ai
the radius in mxignitude
(6)
; and so on.
The object of
tl
proposition called a Datum is to prove that, if in a given figu:
certain parts or relations are given, other parts or relations a:
also given, in one or other of these senses.
It
is
clear
that a
systematic
collection
of Data
such
i
Euclid's would very much facilitate and shorten the pi'ocedu:
in analysis
;
this no doubt accounts for its inclusion in
tl
Treasury of Analysis.
It is to be observed that this form
(
proposition does not actually determine the thing or
relatic
which is shown to be given, but merely proves that
it can
1
determined when
once
the
facts
stated
in
the
hypothes
are known
;
if the proposition stated that a certain thing
so and so, e.g. that a certain straight
line in the figure
is
'
a certain length,
it would be a theorem
;
if
it directed us
find the thing instead of proving that
it
is 'given',
it wou
be a problem
;
hence many propositions of the form of
tl
Data could alternatively be stated in the form of theorems
problems.
We should naturally expect much of the subject-matter
the Elements to appear again in the Data under the diftere:
aspect proper to that book
; and this proves to be the

of the Data, which
state that 'If two straight
lines
contain a given area
in a given
angle, and
if the
difference
(sum)
of them be given, then shall each of them be given.'
The proofs depend directly upon those of Propositions 58, 59,
'If a given area be applied
to a given straight
line, falling
short (exceeding) by a
figure given in
species, the breadths
of
the
deficiency
(excess)
are
given.'
All
the
'areas'
are
parallelograms
.
We
will
give
the
proof
of
Proposition
59
(the
case
of
' excess ').
Let the given area AB
be applied to AG, exceeding by the
figure GB given in species.
I say
that each of the
sides HG, CE
is
given.
Bisect DE in
F, and construct
on EF the figure FG similar and
similarly situated to GB (VI.
18).
Therefore
FG, GB
are about
the
same
diagonal
(VI.
26).
Complete the figure.
Then FG,
being
similar
to
GB,
is given
in
species, and,
since FE is given, FG is given in magnitude (Prop. 52).
But AB
is given
; therefore AB + FG, that is to say, KL, is
given
in magnitude.
But
it
is
also given in
species,
being
similar to GB; therefore the sides of KL are given (Prop. 55).
Therefore KH is given, and, since KG = EF
is also given,
the difierence GH is given.
And GH has a given ratio to HB
;
therefore HB is also given (Prop.
2).
Eucl. III. 35, 36 about the
' power' of a point with reference
to a
circle have their equivalent in Data

that, given a circle and a point in the same plane, the rectangle
contained by the intercepts between this point and the points
in which respectively the circumference is cut by any straight
line
passing
through
the
point
and
meeting
the
circle
is
also given.
A few more
enunciations may be
quoted.
Proposition

: Magnitudes which have given ratios to the

Propositions 45, 46

:

angle given, and the ratio of the sum of the sides containing
that angle, or another angle, to the third side (in each case) be

given, the triangle
is given in
species.
Proposition 52
:
If a
(rectilineal) figure given in species be described on a straight
line given
in magnitude, the
figure
is given in magnitude.
Proposition 66
:
If a triangle have one angle given, the rect-
angle contained by the
sides including the angle has to the
(area
of
the)
triangle a given
ratio.
Proposition
80
:
If
a
triangle have one angle given, and
if the rectangle contained
by the sides including the given angle have to the square on
the third side a given ratio, the triangle is given in species.
Proposition 93 is interesting:
If in a circle given in magni-
tude a straight line be drawn cutting off" a segment containing
a given angle, and if this angle be bisected (by a straight line
cutting the base of the segment and the circumference beyond
it), the sum of the sides including the given angle will have a
given ratio to the chord bisecting the angle, and the rectangle
contained by the sum of the said sides and the portion of the
bisector cut
ofl^ (outside
the segment) towards
the
circum-
ference
will
also be given.
Euclid's proof
is
as
follows.
In
the
cii-cle ABC
let the
chord BC cut
off" a segment containing a given angle BAC,
and let the angle be bisected by ^.E" meeting BC in D.
Join BE.
Then, since the circle is given in magnitude, and
BC cuts off a segment containing a given
angle, BC is given (Pi-op. 87).
Similarly BE is given
; therefore the
ratio BC:BE
is given.
(It
is easy to
see that the
ratio BC:BE is equal
to
2 cos i 4.)
Now, since the angle BAC is bisected,
''
BA:AC = BD: DC.
It follows that {BA +AC): (BD + DC) = AC: DC.
But the triangles ABE, ADC are similar;
therefore
AE
: BE = AG
: DC
= {BA + AC)
: BC, from above.
Therefore
{BA + AC)
: AE = BC
: BE, which
is
a
given
ratio.

THE DATA
425
Again, since the triangles ADO, BDE are similar,
BE:ED = AC:GD={BA + AG): BC.
Therefore
{BA +AC).ED = BC. BE, whieli is given.
On
divisions
(of figures).
The only other work of Euclid in pure geometry which has
survived
(but
not
in
Greek)
is
the book On
divisions
{of
figures), nepl Siaipea-ecou ^l^Xlov.
It is mentioned by Proclus,
who gives some
hints as
to
its content '
; he speaks
of the
business
of
the author being
divisions
of
figures,
circles or
rectilineal
figures, and remarks
that
the parts may be
like
in definition
or
notion, or unlike
; thus to divide a triangle
into
triangles
is
to
divide
it
into
like
figures,
whereas
to
divide it into a triangle and a quadrilateral is to divide it into
unlike figures.
These hints enable us to check to some extent
the genuineness of the books dealing with divisions of figures
which have come down through the Arabic.
It was John Dee
who
first brought to light a treatise De divisionihus by one
Muhammad Bagdadinus
(died 1141) and handed over a copy
of it (in Latin) to Commandinus in 1563
;
it was published by
the latter in Dee's name and
his own
in 1570.
Dee appears
not to have translated the book from the Arabic himself, but
to have made a copy for Commandinus from a manuscript of
a Latin translation which he himself possessed at one time but
which
M'as
apparently
stolen and
probably destroyed some
twenty years after the copy was made.
The copy does not
seem to have been made from the Cotton MS. which passed to
the
British Museum after
it had
been almost destroyed by
a
fire in
1731.^
The Latin translation may have been that
made by Gherard of Cremona (1114-87), since
in the
list of
his numerous
translations a
' liber divisionum
' occurs.
But
the Arabic original cannot have been a direct translation from
Euclid, and probably was not even a direct adaptation of
it,
since
it contains mistakes and unmathematical expressions
;
moreover, as
it does not contain the propositions about the
'
Proclus on Eucl.
I, p. 144. 22-6.
^ The question
is fully discussed by R. C. Archibald, Euclid's Book on
Divisions of Figures with a restoration based on Woepcke's text and on the
Fractica Geometriae of Leonardo Fisaiio (Cambridge 1915).

426
EUCLID
division of a circle alluded to by Proclus, it can scarcely have
contained more than a fragment
of
Euclid's original work.
But Woepcke found in a manuscript
at Paris a
treatise in
Arabic on the
division of
figures, which he translated and
published in 1851.
It is expressly attributed to Euclid in the
manuscript and corresponds to the indications of the content
given by Proclus.
Here we find
divisions of different
recti-
linear figures into figures of the^ same kind, e.g.
of triangles
into triangles or trapezia into trapezia, and also divisions into
' unlike
' figures, e. g. that of a triangle by a straight Kne parallel
to the base.
The missing propositions about the division of
a circle are also here
:
' to divide into two equal parts a given
figure bounded by an arc of a
circle and two straight
lines
including a given angle
' (28), and
' to draw in a given circle
two parallel straight
lines cutting off a certain fraction from
the
circle
' (29).
Unfortunately the proofs are given of only
four propositions out of 36, namely Propositions 19, 20, 28, 29,
the
Arabic
translator
having found the
rest too
easy and
omitted them.
But the genuineness of the treatise edited by
Woepcke is attested by the facts that the four proofs which
remain
are
elegant
and
depend
on
propositions
in
the
Mements, and that there
is a lemma with a true Greek ring,
' to apply to a straight
line a rectangle equal to the rectangle
contained by AB, AG and deficient by a square' (1 8).
Moreover,
the treatise
is no fragment, but ends with the words,
' end of
the treatise
', and is (but for the missing proofs) a well-ordered
and compact
whole.
Hence we may
safely
conclude
that
Woepcke's
tract
represents
not
only
Euclid's work but the
whole
of
it.
The
portion
of the
Pradica
geometriae
of
Leonardo of
Pisa which
deals with the
division
of
figures
seems
to be a
restoration and
extension of
Euclid's work
;

across a version of
it
from the Arabic.
The type of problem which
Euclid's
treatise was designed
to solve may be stated in general terms as that of dividing a
given figure by one or more straight
lines into parts having
prescribed ratios to one another or to other given areas.
The
figures divided are the triangle, the parallelogram, the trape-
zium, the quadrilateral, a figure bounded by an arc of a circle
and two straight lines, and the circle.
The figures are divided

into two equal parts, or two parts in a given
ratio
; or again,
a given fraction of the figure
is to be cut
off, or the figure
is
to be divided into several parts in given ratios.
The dividing-
straight
lines may be
transversals drawn
through
a point
situated at a vertex of the figure, or a point on any side, on one
of two parallel sides, in the interior of the figure, outside the
figure, and so on
; or again, they may be merely parallel lines,
or lines parallel to a base.
The treatise also includes auxiliary
propositions, (1)
' to apply to a given straight
line a rectangle
equal to a given- area and deficient by a square
', the proposi-
tion already mentioned, which is equivalent to the algebraical
solution of the equation axâ€” x^ = h^ and depends on Eucl. II. 5
(cf. p. 152 above)
;

Draw OG parallel to AB and join
AG,BG.
From D, the middle point
of the arc AB, draw the chord DE parallel to BG.
Then shall
BG, DE cut off m/n of the area of the circle.
Since AB, OG are parallel,
AAOB = AAGB.
Add to each the segment ADB
;
therefore

= (segmt. ABG) - (segmt. BFG).
Since BG, DE are parallel, (arc DB) - (arc GE)

therefore
(arc ABC) = (arc DOE), and

therefore

That is BC, DE cut off an area equal to â€” (circle ABC).
Lost geometrical works.
(a)
The Pseudaria.
The other purely geometrical works of Euclid are lost so far
as
is known at present.
One of these again belongs to the
domain of elementary geometry.
This
is the Pseudaria, or
' Book of Fallacies
', as it is called by Proclus, which is clearly
the same work
as the
' Pseudographemata
' of Euclid men-
tioned by a commentator on Aristotle
in terms which agree
with Proclus's description.^
Proclus says of Euclid that,
' Inasmuch
as many things, while appearing to rest on truth
and to follow from scientific principles, really tend to lead one
astray from the
principles and deceive the more
superficial
minds, he has handed down methods for the discriminative
understanding of these things
as
well, by the use of which
methods we
shall
be
able
to
give
beginners
in
this
study
practice
in the discovery of paralogisms, and
to avoid being
ourselves misled.
The treatise by which he puts this machinery
in our hands he entitled (the book) of- Pseudaria, enumerating
in order their various kinds, exercising our intelligence in each
case by theorems of
all
sorts,
setting the true
side by
side
with the
false, and combining
the refutation of
error with
practical illustration.
This book then
is by way of cathartic
and exercise, while the Elernents contain the irrefragable and
complete guide
to
the
actual
scientific
investigation
of the
subjects of geometry.' ^
The connexion of the book with
the Elements and the
refer-
ence to
its usefulness for beginners show that
it did not go
beyond the limits of elementary geometry.

LOST GEOMETRICAL WORKS
431
We now
come
to
the
lost
works
belonging
to
higher
geometry.
The most important was evidently
(;8)
The
Porisms.
Our only source of information about the nature and con-
tents of the Poris'ms is Pappus.
In his general preface about
the books composing the Treasury of Analysis Pappus writes
as follows 1 (I put in square brackets the words bracketed by
Hultsch).
' After the Tangencies (of Apollonius) come, in three Books,
the Porisms of Euclid, a collection [in the view of many] most
ingeniously
devised
for
the
analysis
of
the more weighty
problems, [and] although nature presents an unlimited num-
ber of such porisms, [they have added nothing to what was
originally written by Euclid, except that some before my time
have shown their want of
taste by adding
to a few
(of the
propositions)
second
proofs, each
(proposition) admitting
of
a definite number of demonstrations, as we have shown, and
Euclid having given one for each, namely that which
is the
most
lucid.
These porisms embody a theory subtle, natural,
necessary, and of considerable generality, which is fascinating
to those who can see and produce results].
' Now all the varieties of porisms belong, neither to theorems
nor problems, but to a species occupying a sort of intermediate
position [so that their enunciations can be formed like those of
either theorems or problems], the result being that, of the great
number of geometers, some regarded them as of the class of
theorems, and others of problems, looking only to the form of
the proposition.
But that the ancients knew better the differ-
ence between these three things
is clear from the
definitions.
For they said that a theorem is that which is proposed with a
view to the demonstration of the very thing proposed, a pro-
blem that which is thrown out with a view to the construction
of the very thing proposed, and a porism that which
is
pro-
posed with a view to the producing of the very thing proposed.
[But this
definition of the porism was changed by the more
recent
writers who
could not produce everything, but used
these elements and proved only the
fact that that which
is
sought really exists, but did not produce it, and were accord-
ingly confuted by the definition and the whole doctrine.
They
based
their definition on an
incidental
characteristic, thus
:
A porism
is
that
which
falls
short
of
a locus-theorem
in
' Pappus, vii, pp. 648-60.

432
EUCLID
respect of
its hypothesis.
Of
this kind of porisms
loci are
a species, and they abound in the Treasury of Analysis
; but
this
species has
been
collected, named,
and
handed down
separately from the porisms, because it is more widely diffused
than the other species]
.
.
But it has further become charac:
teristic of porisms that, owing to their complication, the enun-
ciations are put in a contracted form, much being by usage
left
to be understood
;
so that many geometers understand
them
only
in
a
partial way and are ignorant
of the more
essential features of their content.
' [Now
to comprehend a number of
propositions
in one
enunciation
is by no means easy
in
these
porisms, because
Euclid himself has not in fact given many of each species, but
chosen, for examples, one or a few out of a great multitude.
But at the beginning of the first book he has given some pro-
positions, to the number of
ten, of one
species, namely that
more fi'uitful species consisting of loci.]
Consequently, finding
that these admitted of being comprehended in our enunciation,
we have set it out thus
:
If, in a system
of
four straight
lines which cut one
another two and two, three points on one straight line
1 le given, while the rest except one lie on different straight
lines given in position, the remaining point also will
lie
on a straight line given in position.
' This has only been enunciated of four
sti-aight
lines,
of
wliich not more than two pass through the same point, but
it
is not known (to most people) that
it
is true of any assigned
number of straight lines if enunciated thus
:
If any number of straight
lines cut one another, not
more than two
(passing) through the same point, and all
the points
(of intersection
situated) on one
of them be
given, and
if
each
of
those which
are on another
(of
them) lie on a straight line given in position
or still more generally thus
:
if any number of straight lines cut one another, not more
than two
(passing) through the same point, and
all the
points
(of intersection situated) on one of them be given,
while
of
the
other
points
of
intersection
in
multitude
equal to
a triangular number
a number corresponding
to the side of this triangular number
lie respectively On
straight
lines given in
position, provided that
of these
latter
points no
three
are
at
the angular
points
of a
triangle
(so. having for sides three of the given straight

^rHE POJilSMS
433
lines)â€” each of the remaining points will lie on a straight
line given in position.
' It
is
probable that the writer of the Elements was
not
unaware of this, but that he only set out the principle
; and
he seems, in the case of all the porisms, to have laid down the
principles
and
the
seed only
[of many important
things],
the kinds of which should be distinguished according to the
differences, not
of
their
hypotheses, but of the
results and
the things sought.
[All the hypotheses are different from one
another
because they
are
entirely
special, but
each
of
the
results and things sought, being one and the same, follow from
many different hypotheses.]
Wc must then in the
ffrst book distinguish the following
kinds of things sought
:
' At' the beginning of the book is this proposition
;
I. If from
two given points
straight
lines
he draicn
meeting on a straight line given in 2)osition, and one cut
off from, a
straight
line given
in position
{a segment
measured)
to a given point on
it, the other will also cut
off from, another (straight line a segment) having
to
thr
first a given ratio.
' Following on this (we have to prove)
II. that such and such a point
lies on a
straight
line
given in position
;
III.
that the ratio of
sueli and such a pair of straight
lines is given
'
:
&c. &c. (up to XXIX).
'The three books of the porisms. contain 38 lemmas:
of the
theorems themselves there are 171.'
Pappus further gives lemmas to the
Porism.s.''
With Pappus's account
of Porisms must be compared the
papi^ages of Proclus on the same .subject.
Proclus distinguishes
1 Loria (Le scieme esatte nelVantica Grecin, pp. 256-7) gives the mean-
ing of this as follows, pointing out that Simson
first discovered
it
:
'If
a complete n-lateral be deformed so that its sides respectively turn about
n points on a straight line, and (Â»-l) of its |Â« (n-1) vertices move on
as many straight lines, the other |(Â»-1) (Â«-2) of its vertices likewise
move on as many straight
lines
:
but
it
is necessary that
it should be
impossible to form with the (n - 1) vertices any triangle having for sides
the sides of the polygon.'

the two
senses
of
the word
nopiana.
The
first
is that
or
a corollary, where something appears as an incidental result
of a proposition, obtained without trouble or special seeking,
a
sort
of bonus which
the
investigation
has
presented
us
with.i
The
other
sense
is
that
of
Euclid's
Porisms.
In
this sense
' porism
is the name given
to things which are sought, but
need some finding and are neither pure bringing into existence
nor simple theoretic argument.
For (to prove) that the angles
at the base of isosceles triangles are equal is matter of theoretic
argument, and it is with reference to things existing that such
knowledge is (obtained).
But to bisect an angle, to construct
a triangle, to cut
off, or to placeâ€” all these things demand the
making of something
; and to find the centre of a given circle,
or to find the greatest common measure of two given commen-
surable magnitudes, or the like, is in some
sort intermediate
between theorems and problems.
For in these cases there is
no bringing into existence of the things sought, but finding
of them
;
nor
is
the procedure purely
theoretic.
For
it
is
necessary to bring what
is sought into view and exhibit
it
to the
eye.
Such
are the porisms which Euclid wrote and
arranged in three books of Porisms.' ^
Proclus's definition thus agrees well enough with the
first,
the
' older
', definition of Pappus.
A porism occupies a place
between a theorem and a problem;
it deals with something
already existing, as a theorem does, but has io find it (e.g. the
centre
of a
circle), and,
as
a
certain
operation
is therefore
necessary, it partakes to that extent of the nature of a problem,
which
requires
us
to construct
or
produce
something
not
previously existing.
Tims, besides III.

Meonents mentioned by Proclus, the following propositions are
real porisms:
III. 25, VI. 11-13, VII. 33, 34, 36, 39, VIII.
2, 4,
X. 10, XIII. 18.
Similarly, in Archimedes's On the Sphere and'
Cylinder,
I. 2-6 might be called porisms.
The enunciation given by Pappus as comprehending ten of
Euclid's propositions may not reproduce the /orm of Euclid's
enunciations;
but, comparing
the
result
to be proved, that
certain points lie on straight lines given in position, with the
class indicated by II above, where the question is of such and
.such a point lying on a

with other classes,
e. g. (V) that such and such a line is given
in position, (VI) that such and such a line verges to a given point,
(XXVII) that there exists a given point such that
straight
lines drawn from
it
to such and such
(circles)
will contain
a triangle given in species, we may conclude that a usual form
of a porism was
' to prove that
it
is possible
to find a point
with such and such a property
' or
' a straight line on which
lie all the points satisfying given conditions
', and so on.
The above exhausts all the positive information which we
have about the nature of a porism and the contents of Euclid's
I'orisms.
It is obscure and leaves great scope for speculation
and controversy
; naturally, therefore, the problem of restoring
the ForIsms has had a
great
fascination
for
distinguished
mathematicians ever since the revival of learning.
But it has
proved beyond them all.
Some contributions to a solution have,
it is true, been made, mainly by Simson and Chasles.
The first
claim to have restored the Porisms seems to be that of Albert
Girard (about 1590-1633), who spoke (1626) of an early pub-
lication of his
results,
which, however, never saw
the light.
The
great Fermat
(1601-65) gave
his idea
of
a
'porism',
illustrating it by five examples which are very interesting in
themselves
'
; but he did not succeed in connecting them with
the description of Euchd's PorisTns by Pappus, and, though he
expressed a hope of being able to produce a complete restoration
of the latter, his hope was not realized.
It was left for Robert
Simson (1687-1768) to make the first decisive step towards the
solution of the problem.^
He succeeded in explaining the mean-
ing of the actual porisms enunciated in such general terms by
Pappus.
In his tract on Porisms he proves the first porism
given by Pappus in its ten different cases, which, according to
Pappus, Euclid distinguished
(these propositions
are
of the
class connected with
loci);
after this he gives a number of
other
propositions
from
Pappus,
some
auxiliary
proposi-
tions, and some
29
' porisms
', some
of which are meant
to
illustrate
the
classes
I,
VI,
XV,
XXVII-XXIX
distin-
guished by Pappus.
Simson was -able
to evolve a definition
of
a
porism which
is
perhaps more
easily
understood
in
Chasles's translation
:
' Le porisme
est une proposition dans
1 (Euvres de Fermat, ed. Tannery and Henry,

alone needs
to be men-
tioned.
Chasles adopted the definition of a porism given by
Simson, but showed how it could be expressed in a different
form.
' Porisms
are
incomplete
theorems
which
express
certain relations
existing between things variable in accord-
ance with a common
law,
relations which
are
indicated
in
the enunciation of the porism, but which need to be completed
by determining the magnitude or position of certain things
which
are
the consequences
of
the
hj^potheses and which
would be determined in the enunciation of a theorem properly
so called or a complete theorem.'
Chasles succeeded in eluci-
dating the connexion between a porism and a
locus as
de-
scribed by Pappus, though he gave an inexact translation of
the actual words of Pappus
:
' Ce qui constitue le j^orisme est
re qui manque a I'hyiMthese d'un theorcme
local (en d'autres
termes, le porisme est infdrieur, par I'hypothese, au thdoreme
local
;
c'est a dire que quand quelques parties d'une propcsi-
tion locale n'ont pas dans I'^nonce
la determination qui leur
est propre, cette proposition
cesse d'etre regard^e comme un
thi^or^me
et devient un porisme)
'
; here the words italicized
are not quite what Pappus
said,
viz. that
'a porism
is that
which falls short of a locus-theorem
in
respect of
its hypo-
thesis
', but the explanation
in brackets
is correct enough
if
we substitute
' in respect
of
' for
' par
'
(' by ').
The work of
Chasles
is historically important because
it was in the course
of his researches on this subject that he was led to the idea of
anharmonic
ratios;
and he was
probably right in thinking
that the Porisms were propositions belonging to the modern
theory of
transversals and to projective geometry.
But, as a

THE POlilSM^
437
restoration
of
Euclid's work, Chasles's Porisms cannot be re-
garded
as
satisfactory.
One
consideration
alone
is,
to my
mmd, conclusive on this
point.
Cliasles made
' porisms
' out
of
Pappus's
various lemmas to
Euclid's porisms and com-
paratively
easy
deductions
from
those
lemmas.
Now wo
have
experience
of
Pappus's lemmas
to
books which
still
survive, e.g. the Conks of ApoUonius; and, to judge by these
instances,
his lemmas
stood
in a most
ancillary relation
to
the
propositions
to which
they
relate, and
do
not
in
the
least compare with them in difficulty and importance.
Hence
it
IS
all but
impossible
to
believe
that the lemmas
to
the
porisms were themselves porisms such as were
Euclid's own
porisms
; on the contrary, the analogy of Pappus's other sets
of lemmas makes it all but necessary to regard the lemmas in
question
as merely supplying proofs
of
simple
propositions
assumed by Euclid without proof in the course of the demon-
stration of the actual porisms.
This being
so, it appears that
the problem
of
the
complete
restoration
of
Euclid's
three
Books
still awaits a solution, or rather that
it will never be
solved unless in the event of discovery of fresh documents.
At ihe same time
the lemmas of Pappus
to the Porisms
are
by no means
insignificant
propositions
in
themselves,
and,
if the usual relation of lemmas to substantive proposi-
tions
holds,
it
follows
that
the
Porisms
was
a
distinctly
advanced work, perhaps the most important that Euclid ever
wrote
;
its
loss
is therefore much
to
be
deplored.
Zeuthen
has an interesting remark a propos of
tlie proposition which
Pappus quotes as the first proposition of Book
I,
' If from two
given points straight
lines
be drawn meeting on a straight
hne given in position, and one of them cut
off' from a straight
line given in position
(a segment measured) towards a given
point on
it, the other will also cut off from another (straight
line a segment) bearing to the first a given ratio.'
This pro-
position is also true if there be substituted for the first given
straight
line a conic regarded as the 'locus with respect to
four Hues ', and the proposition so extended can be used for
completing
Apollonius's
exposition
of
that
locus.
Zeuthen
suggests, on
this ground, that the Porisms were in part by-
products of the theory of conies and in part auxiliary means
for the study of conies, and that Euclid
called them by the

438
EUCLID
same name
as that applied
to
corollaries because they were
corollaries with respect to
conies.^
This, however,
is a pure
conjecture.
(y)
The Conks.
Pappus says
ot' this lost work
:
' The four books of Euclid's
Conies were completed by Apollonius, who added
four more
and gave
us
eight books
of
Conies.'^
It
is
probable
that
Euclid's work was already lost by Pappus's time, for he goes
on to speak of
' Aristaeus who wrote the still extant five books
of Solid Loci crwexfj tois
kcoulkoTs, connected with, or supple-
mentary
to,
the
conies'.^
This
latter work seems
to have
been a treatise on conies regarded as loci
;
for
' solid loci
' was
a term appropriated
to
conies, as
distinct from
' plane
loci
',
which were
straight
lines and
circles.
In another
passage
Pappus (or an interpolator) speaks of the
' conies
' of Aristaeus
the
' elder V evidently referring to the same book.
Euclid no
doubt wrote on the general theory of conies, as Apollonius did,
but only covered the ground of Apollonius's first tbrÂ§e books,
since Apollonius says that no one before him had touched the
subject of Book IV (which, however, is not important).
As in
the case of the Elements, Euclid would naturally collect and
rearrange, in a systematic
exposition, all that had been dis-
covered up
to date
in the theory of
conies.
That
Euclid's
treatise covered most of the essentials up to the last part of
Apollonius's Book III seems
clear from the fact that Apol-
lonius only claims originality for some propositions connected
with the
'three- and four-line
locus', observing that Euclid
had not completely worked out the synthesis of the said locus,
which,
indeed, was
not
possible
without
the
propositions
referred to.
Pappus (or an interpolator) ' excuses Euclid on
the ground that he made no claim to go beyond the discoveries
of Aristaeus, but only wrote so much about the locus as was
possible with the aid of Aristaeus's conies.
We may conclude
that Aristaeus's book preceded
Euclid's, and that
it was, at
least
in
point of originality, more important.

medes refers to propositions in conies as having been proved

THE comes AND SURFACE-LOCI

in
the
' elements
of
conies
', he
clearly refers
to
these two
treatises, and the other propositions to which he refers as well
known and not needing proof were doubtless taken from the
same sources.
Euclid
still used the
old names for the conic
sections (sections of a right-angled, acute-angled, and obtuse-
angled cone
respectively), but he was aware that an
ellipse
could be obtained by cutting (through) a cone in any manner
by
a plane
not parallel
to the base, and
also by cutting a
cylinder
; this
is clear from a sentence in his Phaenumena to
the effect that,
' If a cone or a cylinder be cut by a plane not
parallel to the base, this section is a section of an acute-angled
cone, which is like a shield {Ovpeos}.'
(<5)
The Sarfuve-Lvct
(tottoi npos
knLcfyaviLa).
Like the Data and the Porisms, this treatise
in two Books
is
mentioned by Pappus
as
belonging
to
the
Treasury
of
AaalysU.
What is meant by surface-loci, literally
' loci on a
surface' is not entirely clear, but wu are able
to form a con-
jecture on the
subject
bj' means
of remarks in Proclus and
Pappus.
The former says
(1)
that a locus is
' a position of a
line
or of a surface which
has (throughout
it) one and the
same
property',^ and
(2)
that
'of
locus-theorems some
are
constructed on lines and others on surfaces
' ^
; the
effect of
these statements together seems to be that
' loci on lines
' are
loci which
are
lines, and
' loci
on
surfaces
'
loci which
are
surfaces.
On the other hand, the possibility does not seem to
be excluded that
loci on surfaces may be
loci
traced on sur-
faces
;
for Pappus says in one place that the equivalent of the
quadratrix can be
got
geometi-ically
' by means
of
loci on
surfaces as follows'^ and then proceeds
to use a
spiral
de-
scribed on a cylinder
(the cylindrical
helix), and
it is consis-
tent with this that in another passage * (bracketed, however, by
Hultsch) 'linear' loci are said to be exhibited {S^LKvvvTai) or
realized from
loci on surfaces, for the quadratrix is a
' linear
'
locus,
i.e.
a locus of
an
order
higher
than
a
plane
locus
(a straight line or circle) and a
' solid
' locus
(a conic).
How-
ever
this may
be,
Euclid's
Surface-Loci probably
included

Proclus on Eucl.

such
loci
as were
cones,
cylinders
and
spheres.
The two
lemmas given by Pappus lend some colour to this view.
The
first of these ' and the figure attached to it are unsatisfactory
as they stand, but Tannery indicated a possible
restoration.^
If this
is right, it suggests that one of the
loci contained
all
the points on the elliptical parallel sections of a cylinder, and
was
therefore an oblique
circular cylinder.
Other assump-
tions with regard to the conditions to which the lines in the
figure may be subject would suggest that other loci dealt with
were cones regarded as
containing
all points on
particular
parallel elliptical sections of the cones.
In the second lemma
Pappus
states and gives a complete proof of the focus-and-
directrix property of a
conic,
viz.
that the locus of a point
the distance vftvhich from a given point
is
in a given ratio
to
its distance from a fixed straight line
is a conic section,
which
is an ellipse, a parabola or a hyperbola according as the
given ratio is less than, equcd to, or greater than unitg?
Two
conjectures are possible as to the application of this theorem in
Euclid's Surface-Loci,
(a) It may have been used to j^rove that
the locus of a point the distance of which from a given straight
line
is
in a given
ratio
to
its
distance from a given plane
is
a
certain
cone.
Or
(&)
it may have been used
to prove
tlaat the locus of a point the distance of which from a given
point
is in a given ratio to
its distance from a given plane is
the surface formed by the re^'olution of a conic about its major
or conjugate axis.^
We come now to Euclid's works under the head of
Applied
matlieniatics.
(a)
The
Phaenomena.
The book on sphaeric- intended
for use
in astronomy and
entitled Phaenomena has already been noticed (pp. 349, 351-2).
It is extant in Greek and was included in Gregory's edition of
Euclid.
The text of Gregory, however, represents the later
of two
recensions which
difler
considerably
(especially
in
Propositions
9
to
16).

manuscript
of
this
later
recension

while the best manuscript of the older and better version
(a)
is the Viennese MS.Vind. gr. XXXI. 13 of the tM^elfth century.
A new
text
edited by Menge and
taking account
of both
recensions is now available in the last volume of the Heiberg-
Menge edition of Euclid.^
(P)
Optica and
Catoptricd.
The Optics, a treatise included by Pappus in the collection of
works known as the Little Astronomy, survives in two foi-ms.
One
is the
recension
of Theon translated by Zambertus in
1505;
the
Greek
text was
first
edited by Johannes Pena
(de la Pene) in 1557, and this form of the treatise was alone
included in the
editions up to Gregory's.
But Heiberg
dis-
covered the
earlier form
in two manuscripts, one at Vienna
(Vind. gr. XXXI.
1 3) and one at Florence (Laurent. XXVIII. 3),
and both recensions are contained in vol. vii of the Heiberg-
Menge text of Euclid (Teubner, 1895).
There
is no reason to
doubt that the
earlier recension
is
Euclid's own work
;
the
style is much more hke that of the Elements, and the proofs of
the propositions are more complete and clear.
The later recen-
sion is further differentiated by a preface of some length, which
is
said by a
scholiast
to be taken from the commentary
or
elucidation by Theon.
It would appear that the text of this
recension is Theon's, and that the preface was a reproduction
hy a pupil of what was explained by Theon in lectures.
It
cannot have been written much, if anything, later than Theon's
time, for it
is quoted by Nemesius about A.D. 400.
Only the
earlier
and
genuine
version
need
concern
us
here.
It
is
a kind of elementary treatise on perspective, and it may have
been
intended
to
forearm
students
of
astronomy
against
paradoxical
theories
such
as
those
of the
Epicureans, who
maintained that the heavenly bodies are of the size that they
look.
It begins in the orthodox fashion with Definitions, the
fu-st of which embodies the same idea of the process of vision
as we find in Plato, namely that
it
is due to rays proceeding
from our
eyes
and
impinging
upon
the
object, instead
of
the other way about:
'the
straight
lines
(rays) which
issue-
from the eye traverse the distances
(or dimensions) of great

magnitudes
'
; Def . 2
:
' The tigure contained by the visual rays
is a cone which has
its vertex in the eye, and its base at the
extremities of the objects seen
'
; Def .
3
:
' And those things
are seen on which the
visual rays impinge, while those are
not seen on which they do not
'
;
Def. 4
:
' Things seen under
a greater angle appear greater, and those under a lesser angle
less,
while
things
seen under
equal
angles
appear
equal
'
;
Def. 7
:
' Things seen under more angles appear more distinctly.'
Euclid assumed
that the
visual rays are not
' continuous
',
i.e.
not
absolutely
close
together, but
are
separated by
a
certain
distance, and
hence
he concluded,
in
Proposition
1,
that we can never really see the whole of any object, though
we seem to do
so.
Apart, however, from such inferences as
these from false hypotheses, thei'e is much in the treatise that
is sound.
Euclid has
the
essential truth that the rays are
straight;
and
it makes no
difference geometrically whether
they
proceed from
the eye or the
object.
Then,
after
pro-
positions explaining the differences in the apparent size of an
object according to its position relatively to the eye, he proves
that the apparent sizes of two equal and parallel objects are
not proportional to their distances from the eye (Prop. 8)
;
in
tills proposition he proves the equivalent of the fact that, if a,
j3 are two angles and a <
/8 <
-I tt, then
tan a
a
tan /3
'^ /3'
the
equivalent
of
wliich,
as
well
as
of
the
corresponding
formula with
sines, is assumed without proof by Aristarchus
a little later.
From Proposition
6 can easily be deduced the
fundamental
proposition
in
perspective
that
parallel
lines
(regarded as equidistant throughout) appear to meet.
There
are four simple propositions in heights and distances, e.g. to
find
the
height
of an
object
(1)
when
the
sun
is
shining
(Prop.
18), (2) when it is not (Prop. 19)
:
similar triangles are,
,
of course, used and the horizontal mirror appears in the second
case in the orthodox manner, with the assumption that the
angles
of
incidence and
reflection
of
a
ray
are
equal,
'as
is explained in the Catoptrica (or theory of mirrors)
'.
Pro-
positions 23-7
prove
that,
if an eye
sees a
sphere,
it
sees
less than half of the sphere, and the contour of what
is seen

OPTICS
443
appears
to be
a
circle;
if
the
eye
approaches
nearer
to
the sphere the portion seen becomes
less, though
it appears
greater
;
if we
see the sphere with two eyes, we see a hemi-
sphere, or more than a hemisphere, or less than a hemispliere
according as the distance between the eyes is equal to, greater
tlian,
or
less
than
the
diameter
of
the
sphere;
these
pro-
positions
are
comparable
with
Aristarchus's
Proposition
2
stating that,
if a
spliere be illuminated by a larger sphere,
the
illuminated
portion
of
the
former
will
be
greater
than a hemisphere.
Similar propositions with regard to the
cylinder and cone
follow
(Props.
28-33).
Next Euclid con-
siders
the
conditions
for
the apparent equality
of
different
diameters of a circle as seen from an eye occupying various
positions outside the
plane
of
the
circle
(Props.
34-7)
;
he
shows that
all diameters will appear equal, or the circle will
really
look
like
a
circle,
if
the
line joining the eye
to the
centre is perpendicular to the plane of the circle, or, not being
perpendicular
to
that
plane,
is
equal
to
the
length
of the
radius, but this will not otherwise be the case (35), so that (36)
a
chariot wheel
will sometimes appear
circular, sometimes
awry, according
to
the
position
of
the
eye.
Propositions
3 7 and 38 prove, the one that there is a locus such that, if the
eye remains at one point of
it, while a straight line moves so
that
its
extremities always
lie
on
it,
the
line
will
always
appear of the same length in whatever position
it
is placed
(not being one in which either of the
extremities
coincides
with, or
the
extremities are on opposite
sides
of, the
point
at which the eye
is placed), the locus being, of course, a circle
in which
the
straight
line
is
placed
as
a
chord, when
it
necessarily subtends the same angle at the circumference or at
the centre, and therefore at the eye, if placed at a point of the
,
circumference or at the centre
; the other proves the same thing
for the case where the line is fixed with its extremities on the
locus, while the eye moves upon it.
The same idea underlies
several other propositions,
e.g. Proposition
45, which proves
that
a common
point
can
be
found
from
which
unequal
magnitudes will appear equal.
The unequal magnitudes are
straight lines BC, CD so placed that BCD
is a straight line.
A segment greater than a semicircle
is described on BG, and
a similar segment on CD.
The segments
will then
intersect

444
EUCLID
at
F, and
the
angles
subtended by BG and CD
at
-F .are
equal.
The rest of the treatise
is of the same character, and
it need not be further described.
The Gatoptrica published by Heiberg in the same volume is
not by Euclid, but is a compilation made at a much later date,
possibly by Theon of Alexandria, from ancient works on the
subject and mainly no doubt from those of Archimedes and
Heron.
Theon ^ himself quotes a Gatoptrica by Archimedes,
and Olympiodorus ^ quotes Archimedes as having proved the
fact which
appears
as an axiom
in
the
Gatoptrica now in
question, namely
that, if an object be placed just out of sight
at the bottom of a vessel, it will become visible over the edge
when water is poured in.
It
is not even certain that Euclid
wrote
Gatoptrica
at
all,
since,
if
the
treatise was Theou's,
Proclus may have assigned
it to Euclid through iiiadvertence.

Proclus
attributes
to Euclid a work on
the Elements of
Music
{at Kara

(rTOL\â‚¬i(i>(Jiis)"
',
SO
does
Marinus.*
As a matter of fact, two musical treatises attributed to Euclid
are still extant, the Sectio Ganonis {KaraTofifj Kavovos) and the
Iniroductio
harmonica
(Elaraymyr)
apfj.oviKrj).
The
latter,
however, is certainly not liy Euclid, but by Cleonides, a pupil
of Aristoxenus.
The question remains, in what relation does
the
iiiectio
Ganoids
stand
to
tlie
'Elements' mentioned by
Proclus
and
Marinus ?
The
l^ectio
gives
the
Pythagorean
theory of music, but
is
altogether
too
partial and
slight
to
deserve the
title
' Elements of Music
'.
Jan, the editor of the
Masici Graeci, thought that the iSectio was a sort of summary
account
extracted from
the
' Elements
' by
Euclid
himself,
which
hardly seems
likely;
he
maintained
that
it
is
the
genuine work of Euclid on the grounds
(1) that the style and
diction and the form of the propositions agi'ee well with what
we
find
in
Euclid's Elements, and
(2) that Porphyry in
his
commentary on Ptolemy's Harmonica thrice quotes Euclid as
the author of a

and

some
things
quite
unworthy of Euclid

tracted by some other author of less ability from
tlie genuine
' Elements of Music
' by Euclid.
(S) Works on mechanics
attributed
to
Euclid.
The Arabian
list of Euclid's works further includes among
tliose held to be genuine
' the book of the Heavj' and Light
'.
This is apparently' tlie tract De Levi
et poaderoso included by
Hervagius
in
the
Basel
Latin
translation
of
1537
and by
Gregory
in
his
edition.
That
it comes from
the Greek
is
made clear by the
lettering of the
figures
; and
this
is con-
firmed by the fact that another, ver}^ slightly different, version
exists at Dresden (Cod. Dresdensis Db. 86), which is evidently'
a version of an Arabic translation from the Greek, since the
lettering of the figures follows the order characteristic of sucli
Arabic translations,
a,
b, g, d,
e, z,
1t,
t.
The tract consists of
nine definitions or axioms and five propositions.
Among the
definitions are these
: Bodies are equal, different, or greater in
size according as they occupy equal, different, or greater spaces
(1-3).
Bodies are
equEil
in power or in virtue which move
over equal distances in the same medium of
air or water in
equal times
(4), while the poiuer or virtue
is
greater
if the
motion takes
less time, and less
if
it takes more (6).
Bodies
are of the same hind if, being equal in size, they are also equal
in p>ower when the medium
is the same
; they are different in
kind when, being equal in size, they are not equal in power or
virtue (7, 8).
Of bodies different in kind, that has more jMiver
which is more dense (soUdivs) (9).
With these hypotheses, the
author attempts to prove (Props.
1,
3, 5) that, of bodies whicli
traverse unequal spaces
in equal times, that which traverses
the greater space has the greater ^JOice?- and that, of bodies of
the same kind, the power is proportional to the size, and con-
verselJ^ if the poiuer is proportional to the size, the bodies are
of the same
kind.
We
recognize
in the potentia
or
virtufi
the same thing as the Swa/in and la-xvs of
Aristotle.^
The
'
Aristotle, Physia,

446
EUCLID
property assigned by the author to bodies of the same kioid is
quite different from what we attribute to bodies of the same
specific
gravity;
he
purports
to prove
that
bodies
of
the
same kind have poiver proportional to their size, and the effect
of
this, combined with the
definitions,
is that they move
at
speeds proportional
to their volumes.
Thus the tract
is the
most
precise
statement that we
possess
of the
principle
of
Aristotle's dynamics, a principle which persisted until Bene-
detti (1530-90) and Gahlei (1564-1642) proved its falsity.
There are yet other fragments on mechanics associated with
the name of Euclid.
One
is a
tract translated by Woepcke
from
the Arabic
in 1851 under the
title 'Le livre d'Euchde
sur la balance ', a work which, although spoiled by some com-
mentator, seems to go back
to a Greek original and to have
been an attempt to establish a theory of the lever, not from a
general principle of dynamics like that of Aristotle, but from
a few simple axioms such as the experience of daily life might
suggest.
The
original work may have
been
earlier
than
Archimedes and may have been written by a contemporary of
Euclid.
A third fragment, unearthed by Duhem from manu-
scripts in the Bibliotheque Nationale in
Paris, contains four
propositions purporting
to be
'liber
Euelidis de
ponderibus
secundum terminorum
circumferentiam
'.
The
first
of
the
propositions, connecting the law of the
le^â€¢er with the
size of
the
circles described by
its ends,
recalls the
similar demon-
stration in the Aristotelian Mechanica
; the others attempt to
give a theory of the balance, taking account of the weight of
the lever itself, and assuming that a portion of it (regarded as
cylindrical) may be supposed to be detached and replaced by
an equal weight suspended from its middle point.
The three
fragments supplement each other in a curious way, and it is a
question whether thej^ belonged to one treatise or were due to
different authors.
In any case there seems to be no indepen-
dent
evidence
that
Euclid was
the
author
of any
of
the
fragments, or that he wrote on mechanics at
all.'^
