ABSTRACT
Hashing is a fundamental operation in database management, play-
ing a key role in the implementation of numerous core database data
structures and algorithms. Traditional hash functions aim to mimic
a function that maps a key to a random value, which can result in col-
lisions, where multiple keys are mapped to the same value. There are
many well-known schemes like chaining, probing, and cuckoo hash-
ing to handle collisions. In this work, we aim to study if using learned
models instead of traditional hash functions can reduce collisions
and whether such a reduction translates to improved performance,
particularly for indexing and joins. We show that learned models
reduce collisions in some cases, which depend on how the data is
distributed. To evaluate the effectiveness of learned models as hash
function, we test them with bucket chaining, linear probing, and
cuckoo hash tables. We find that learned models can (1) yield a 1.4x
lower probe latency, and (2) reduce the non-partitioned hash join
runtime with 28% over the next best baseline for certain datasets. On
the other hand, if the data distribution is not suitable, we either do
not see gains or see worse performance. In summary, we find that
learned models can indeed outperform hash functions, but only for
certain data distributions.

INTRODUCTION
Hashing and hashing-based algorithms and data structures find
countless applications throughout computer science, such as in ma-
chine learning, computer graphics, bioinformatics, and compilers
(e.g., [13, 42, 51, 55]). Hashing is also a fundamental operation in
database management (e.g., [8, 37, 66]), including playing a key role
in the implementation of numerous core database data structures

and algorithms (e.g., indexes [37, 38], filters [36], joins [8], partition-
ing [63], and aggregation [26]). Due to its numerous applications,
considerable research efforts have focused on introducing efficient
hashing functions (e.g., [48, 51, 60, 66]).
Traditionally, hash functions aim to mimic a function that maps a
key to a random value in a specified output range. For typical cases
where the size of the output range is linear in the number of keys,
this random assignment results in colliding keys. A collision occurs
when multiple keys get mapped to the same output value. A typi-
cal hash index approach allocates a number of fixed size slots (the
number of slots generally being a constant times the expected num-
ber of keys) and maps incoming keys into these slots using a hash
function. The ideal case for indexes would have no keys collide, so
each key goes to its own separate slot. This would make key lookups
and updates faster, as one would simply check the corresponding
slot for the key. With truly random hash functions, collisions are
unavoidable, and one can readily calculate the expected number of
collisions given the number of slots and keys [54].
Naturally, there are many well-known schemes like chaining,
probing, and cuckoo hashing to handle collisions. As the name sug-
gests, chaining handles collisions by creating a chain of colliding
keys. Probing checks neighboring slots to find an empty slot to place
the key. Cuckoo hashing handles collisions by using multiple hash
functions to provide alternate slots for colliding keys. For each of
these schemes, more collisions reduces their performance.
Anotherapproachtobuildhashindexesistouseperfect hashfunc-
tions instead of truly random hash functions. Perfect hash functions
have no collisions; however, they must be specially constructed for a
given dataset, and have other costs in storage and computation time.
In recent years, several works have utilized the idea of using ma-
chine learning to improve the performance of many database compo-
nents (e.g., [39, 53, 69]) and basic data structures (e.g., [24, 25, 43, 49]).
By using machine learning to explicitly capture trends in the under-
lying data, these methods can aim for instance-optimal performance.
For example, in a recent benchmarking study [52], it has been shown
thatlearnedindexstructures(e.g.,RMI[43],RadixSpline[40]),which
employ CDF-based learned models, can outperform traditional in-
dexes on practical workloads.
As one direction in this line of research, it was suggested in [43]
that such learned models can be used to obtain an efficient hash
function with fewer collisions. They also provided some empirical
evidence that a hash index with learned model as the hash function
can have better performance than using a truly random hash func-
tion. What is unclear, however, is when such learned models are
effective in replacing existing hash functions in applications. At one
end, traditional hash functions [29, 80] are fast to compute, but suffer
532

from collisions [77] that can reduce query performance. On the other
hand, perfect hash functions [51] avoid collisions, but are difficult
to construct [45], and are not scalable [21], in the sense that the size
of the function representation grows with the size of the input data.
As an alternative, learned models can potentially provide a better
tradeoff between computation and collisions. If the model learns
a good approximation of the empirical CDF of the input keys, we
may achieve few collisions; and if the data allows a compact learned
model, we may achieve a model size independent of or very slowly
growing with the input data size.
Surprisingly,though,wearenotawareofathoroughexperimental
study examining the learned models against both traditional and per-
fect hashing in query processing operations like indexing and joins.
We aim to remedy that here. We make the following contributions:
• We provide an analysis of the factors affecting collisions for
learned models, helping us to identify situations where they
can have fewer collisions than traditional hash functions.
• Weperformanextensivebenchmarkingstudyfortraditional,
perfect, and learned model based hash functions. We bench-
mark them through three different applications: hash table
probing/inserting, range querying, and joins. We test using
multiple synthetic and real-world datasets.
• Through the empirical study and analysis we find useful in-
sights on when to use learned models instead of traditional
and perfect hashing in various database applications.
• We provide a unified open-source implementation for the
baselines used in our experiments1.
In summary, our collisions analysis and experimental benchmark-
ing demonstrate that, for datasets with a well-ordered distribution of
gapsbetweentheirkeys,learnedmodelscanresultinlowercollisions
than traditional hash functions. For these datasets, using learned
models can improve the probe and insert throughputs of hash tables.
Such improvement varies with the hashing scheme (strongest with
bucket chaining, and weakest with cuckoo hashing), the load factor,
and the bucket capacity. In many other cases, however, such as with
data from typical distributions (e.g., normal) or having string keys,
we do not see collision reduction using learned models. We also find
that using learned models with bucket chaining can support range
queries, and provides the best throughput in mixed workloads (point
and range queries) that have a majority of point queries. Finally, we
find that using learned models in non-partitioned hash join [44, 79]
results in improved performance for favourable datasets.

TRADITIONAL HASH FUNCTIONS
A uniform hash function ℎ(𝑥) : 𝑋↦→𝑈attempts to map arbitrary
inputs to independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform
random outputs. Obtaining true randomness is not feasible in prac-
tice [42]. However, state-of-the-art hash functions appear to come
reasonably close to imitating true randomness in many practical set-
tings [59, 80]. The extent to which a hash function avoids collisions,
i.e., instances where two distinct inputs map to the same output, is
often referred to as the its’ quality. There is a seemingly endless sup-
ply of different proposed hash functions to choose from [80]. Here,
we briefly give a background on some of the well-known functions
that we study in the paper.
1https://github.com/DominikHorn/hashing-benchmark
Multiplicative Hashing (MultiplyPrime). This method is promi-
nently described by Donald Knuth [42] as a family of hash functions
with great properties for practical applications. He explicitly adver-
tises their non-uniform random properties, i.e., sensitivity to the
data distribution, as a strength [42]. Let 𝐴be a constant, relatively
prime 2𝑤with 𝑤being the machine word size. Then, the following
function produces outputs in [0,𝑀).
ℎ(𝑥) =

𝑀·
 𝐴
2𝑤𝑥

mod 1

The trick to make this efficient is to avoid fractional computations by
shiftingthecalculationby𝑤,i.e.,tomultiplywith 𝐴
2𝑤≪𝑤=𝐴instead
of the complex decimal computation: ℎ(𝑥) =
 𝑀
2𝑤·(𝐴𝑥mod 2𝑤)
.
Neatly, this gets rid of the modulo since most physical machines with
awordsize𝑤willnaturallycomputeeverything mod2𝑤.According
to Knuth, 𝑀should be some power of the machine’s radix [42] to en-
sure that we are including the more significant bits in the final result.
Fibonacci Hashing (FibonacciPrime). It is an instance of mul-
tiplicative hashing, choosing 𝐴
𝑤= Φ−1 =
√
5−1

/2 based on the
golden ratio. It promises to inherit Φ−1’s neat scattering character-
istics, i.e., that each added consecutive element falls in the largest
remaining interval, dividing it by the golden ratio [6, 42, 74, 75, 82].
As in multiplicative hashing, we implement Fibonacci hashing us-
ing the integer multiplication trick. However, this time we choose
𝐶=Φ·2𝑤with 𝑤as the machine word size. Some implementations
also round𝐶to the next closest prime.
Murmur Hashing (Murmur). It is a family of simple and fast hash
functions developed by Austin Appleby [3, 4], and has been studied
extensively in previous works (e.g., [2, 66]). Its name is derived from
the original idea for its implementation, i.e., repeatedly applying
multiply and rotate instructions to imitate true randomness. How-
ever, it ended up being implemented as a sequence of multiply, shift,
and xor operations. In particular, its 64-bits finalizer merely consists
of three xors, three shifts, and two multiplications [3, 66].

AquaHash. It is a uniform hash function that utilizes Advanced
Encryption Standard (AES) intrinsics [33], i.e., AES encryption prim-
itives implemented in hardware on many modern CPUs [68]. In a
previous study, AquaHash has shown promising results compared
to XXHash and Murmur for small keys [70].

LEARNED MODELS AS HASH FUNCTIONS
Learned index structures [43] approximate the cumulative distribu-
tion function (CDF) of the data to predict the position of a lookup key
in a sorted array. When the data has a learnable pattern, i.e., has low
entropy, learned indexes can be much smaller than the input data
itself. While initial proposals considered using neural networks to
approximate the CDF, state-of-the-art learned indexes use a collec-
tion of simple linear models, which we refer to as submodels; these
are fast to both learn and evaluate. Some indexes aim to minimize
the root-mean-squared-error (i.e., L2 loss) [43] and others bound
the maximum prediction error. Assuming a perfect modeling of the
CDF, a learned index would constitute a perfect order-preserving
533

hash function, i.e., a collision-free mapping from keys to positions.
For the rest of this paper, we refer to Learned Model based Hash
functionsasLMH.Sincereal-worlddatacontainsmanyirregularities
that make it hard to approximate, a learned index inevitably needs
to trade off precision for space. With larger models, inference time
increases because of limited cache sizes [52]. We describe the three
main learned indexes we evaluate for hashing.
Recursive Model Indexes (RMI). The RMI index is a multi-stage
model combining simpler models [43]. When the data fits into mem-
ory,anRMIrarelyhasmorethantwostages.Itisbuiltina“top-down”
fashion. The stage-one model computes a rough approximation of
the CDF, which is scaled between 0 and the branching factor 𝐵. This
value is used to select a second-stage model, which approximates
the local distribution of the data and is used to produce the final
approximation. In other words, the stage-one model partitions the
data into 𝐵buckets and each second-stage model approximates the
data that falls into its corresponding bucket. A recent study [52]
showed that RMI, amongst other indexes, achieves the best tradeoff
between inference time and space.
Radix Spline Indexes (RadixSpline). It is another learned in-
dex variant [40], that is built “bottom up”, and consists of a linear
spline [58] to approximate the CDF and a radix lookup table that
indexes resulting spline points. Compared to RMI, RadixSpline can
be built in a single pass with constant cost per element. RadixSpline’s
spline-building algorithm [58] bounds the maximum prediction er-
ror. Besides the maximum error, RadixSpline is parameterized with
a certain number of radix bits that define the size of the radix table.
Lookups first consult the radix table, which indexes 𝑟-bit prefixes of
spline points and is used to narrow the search range over the spline
points. Then binary search is used on the narrowed range to identify
the two spline points surrounding the lookup key. Finally, linear
interpolationbetweenthetwosplinepointsisusedtoobtainapredic-
tion.Thenecessitytosearchoverthesplinepointsmakeitsomewhat
slower than RMI which does not require any search in inner nodes.
Piece-wise Geometric Model Indexes (PGM). Similar to RadixS-
pline, the PGM index [30] provides an error-bounded approximation
of the CDF. It consists of multiple levels where each level represents
an error-bounded piece-wise linear regression (PLR). In contrast
to a spline where consecutive spline points are connected, a PLR
additionally stores an intercept value with each point. Like RadixS-
pline, PGM is built “bottom up” but instead of using a radix layer it
recursively applies its PLR algorithm until a certain error threshold
has been met. PGM can also be built in a single pass with constant
amortized cost per element. Due to its multi-level structure, PGM
can have slightly higher inference cost than RadixSpline [52] but is
more robust when outliers are present. Note that we explore static
PGM only in our study.

PERFECT HASHING
Wheretraditionalhashfunctionsaimtoproduce(near)-i.i.d.uniform
random outputs, perfect hash functions provide an injective function
that maps a set of elements into a range. That is, for a given input set,
the function will produce no collisions [10, 28, 32, 51]. Here, we focus
on two types of perfect hash functions: minimal perfect (MPHF), and
order preserving minimal perfect (OMPHF). We first explain the cor-
responding definitions, and then describe the state-of-the-art MPHF
and OMPHF algorithms we study.
Perfect. A hash function ℎ(𝑥) :𝑋↦→[0,𝑁] is perfect for the domain
𝑋if it is injective. Equivalently, it produces zero collisions in the
output domain (∀𝑥1,𝑥2 ∈𝑋:ℎ(𝑥1) =ℎ(𝑥2) =⇒𝑥1 =𝑥2).
Minimal. A hash function ℎ(𝑥) :𝑋↦→[0,𝑁] is minimal perfect if it is
perfect and a bijection; that is, each element of the output range has
a single corresponding domain element (Perfect, and additionally
∀𝑦∈[0,𝑁] : ∃𝑥∈𝑋| ℎ(𝑥) =𝑦). The information theoretical lower
bound for storing a minimal perfect hash function is lg𝑒≈1.44 bits
per key [10, 15, 28, 32, 35] since key-related information is not re-
tained after construction. For this reason, querying with non-keys
(unknown keys) generally yields arbitrary results.
Order Preserving. Order preserving perfect hash functions order
their outputs according to the original relative order ⪯of input el-
ements (∀𝑥1,𝑥2 ∈𝑋:𝑥1 ⪯𝑥2 =⇒ℎ(𝑥1) ≤ℎ(𝑥2)). Being able to store
any arbitrary data order induces an Ω(𝑛log𝑛) space cost [10].
Comparison to Traditional Hashing. In general, building a MPHF,
ℎ(𝑥) :𝑋↦→[0,𝑁], requires knowing the entire input set 𝑋a priori.
In many implementations, the set 𝑋is not stored or reconstructible
after the MPHF is built. Querying with a non-key 𝑥′∉𝑋generally
yields some arbitrary output value; most often, ℎ(𝑥′) ∈[0,𝑁], but
this is not guaranteed. MPHF are generally not easily updated in
place; often a full rebuild is performed if a new element is inserted, or
other expensive (non-constant) time work. Compared to traditional
hashing, where only constant work is necessary for initialization,
MPHF and OMPHF generally require running a one time O(𝑛) build
algorithm before they can be used.
RecursiveSplitting(RecSplit).ItisaMPHFwhichhasbeenshown
to deliver state-of-the-art results in regards to space usage, lookup,
and build time [28]. Specifically, it comes close to achieving the the-
oretically optimal 1.44 bits per key in practice, while only requiring
expected linear and constant times for construction and lookups,
respectively [28]. RecSplit works by recursively partitioning inputs
into ever smaller buckets until brute force search for a MPHF, i.e.,
a bijection, is viable. The threshold for this search, called leaf size 𝑙,
as well as the average bucket size 𝑏for partitioning are parameters
of the construction algorithm. RecSplit utilizes an indexed family of
uniform random hash functions (examples in Section 2). This enables
efficiently encoding the tree of brute-force determined indexes using
an optimal Golomb-Rice instantaneous code [28, 71].
MWHC. It was originally proposed as a family of OMPHFs with
expected O(𝑛) construction and O(1) access time [51]. It has been
extended to provide a practical MPHF with constant access and re-
quiring 3 bits per key storage [10, 14]. We refer to our simplified im-
plementationofthelatterapproachasBitMWHC.Abstractly,MWHC
utilizes a hypergraph to efficiently find a solution for a randomly gen-
erated system of linear equations that is used to store the desired or-
derpreservinghashfunction 𝑓(𝑥) :𝑋↦→𝑈givenby 𝑓(𝑥) =𝑣(ℎ1(𝑥))⋄
...⋄𝑣(ℎ𝑘(𝑥)), where eachℎ𝑖denotes a distinct uniform random hash
function, 𝑣(𝑥) maps each hash function output to a value in𝑈and
⋄reduces 𝑈×𝑈to 𝑈. In practice, 𝑣(𝑥) may, for example, be imple-
mented as a simple array of values, ℎ𝑖as a family of reasonably high
quality hash functions such as Murmur with seed values, and ⋄as
xor or as addition with an additional modulo computation at the end.
The construction algorithm first builds a𝑘-hypergraph with each
of the 𝜆|𝑋| vertices corresponding to one entry of 𝑣(𝑥) and one edge
534

[ℎ1(𝑥),...,ℎ𝑘(𝑥)] for each input, where 𝑘and 𝜆are user-defined pa-
rameters. All ℎ𝑖are randomly chosen from a suitable family of hash
functions as described above. A valid assignment for 𝑣(𝑥) exists,
i.e., 𝑓(𝑥) is solvable iff this hypergraph is acyclic. A simple peeling
scheme is used to both determine acyclicity and the order in which
we can safely assign values to each 𝑣(𝑥) to yield the desired values
for 𝑓(𝑥) for each 𝑥∈𝑋. We simply restart if the acyclicity test fails,
hence the expected O(𝑛) construction time [51]. For𝑘=3, we require
𝜆≥1.23 to efficiently find a suitable acyclic hypergraph [51, 56].

HASHING SCHEMES
Whencollisionsoccurinahashtable,theyareresolvedusinghashing
schemes. In this section, we give a brief background on the hashing
schemes we study in this paper. In each scheme, we discuss how the
hash table is implemented and how collisions are handled.
5.1
Bucket Chaining (CHAIN)
Bucket chaining is a classic collision resolving scheme [8, 66, 70].
In this scheme, the hash table is implemented as an array of pre-
allocated buckets, where each bucket stores multiple tuples, with col-
lidedkeys,ataspecificslotinthetable.Toinsertatuple,thekeyofthis
tupleisfirsthashedtoaslotinthehashtable,andthenthewholetuple
isfirsttriedtobeplacedinthecorrespondingbucketatthisslot.Ifthe
current bucket is already filled up, a new one is created, pre-allocated
and chained to it. To query for a tuple, the query key is first hashed to
a slot in the table (similar to what happens in inserts), then the chain
of buckets at this slot is traversed until either the matching tuple is
found or the end of the chain is reached (i.e., the matching tuple is
not found). In general, bucketization improves the data locality, and
reduces the number of cache misses. That being said, choosing the
bucket size should be carefully tuned to avoid wasting large spaces.
5.2
Open-Addressing
In open-addressing, all tuples are inserted in the hash table slots
themselves, without extra chains to handle collisions. In case of a tu-
plewithacollidingkey,thehashtableslotsareprobed(i.e.,searched),
until a slot is found to place the tuple [19, 66]. Typically, a probing
scheme decides the set of hash table slots to check, referred to as
a probing sequence, till a place is found to insert the tuple. Query
operations follow the same probe sequence. There are two main
categories of probing schemes: (1) schemes that probe for the first
available (i.e., empty) slot, and (2) schemes that evict the existing
tuple at the probe location (i.e., when a collision occurs) and replace
it with the new tuple. In this paper, we study an example of each of
these two categories (linear probing and cuckoo hashing).
Linear Probing (LP). This is the most basic probing scheme for colli-
sion handling in open-addressing. In this scheme, when inserting (or
querying) a tuple, the key of this tuple is first hashed to obtain a hash
table slot (i.e., initial probe location). Then, the hash table is sequen-
tially traversed starting from this slot. In case of insertion, the traver-
sal stops if an available slot is found. In case of querying, the traversal
stopsifwefindeitherthematchingtupleoranemptyslot(i.e.,match-
ing tuple is not found). Linear probing has two main advantages:
(1) its simple design, and (2) cache efficiency due to the sequential
scan. In contrast, its performance degrades when large contiguous
blocksofhashtableslotsareoccupied,referredtoasprimaryclusters.
Inthiscase,thenumberofnearbyemptyslotsaroundeachprobeloca-
tionissignificantlyreduced,andtheschemetendstohavelongprobe
sequences. Such performance issue can be avoided by either (1) in-
creasing the hash table size such that the percentage of its occupied
slots (a.k.a load factor) is always kept less than 60% [66] or (2) care-
fully tuning its update operations [11]. We note that there are two
other popular variants of linear probing: (1) quadratic [19, 42], and
(2) robinhood [17], which are efficient for write-heavy and high un-
successful lookup workloads, respectively. However, according to a
recent study [66], linear probing outperforms both of them using the
appropriate load factor. Therefore, we focus on linear probing here.
Cuckoo Hashing (CUCKOO).Cuckoohashing[60]providesanother
useful alternative hash table design. A simple variation of cuckoo
hashing uses two subtables, where each subtable has an independent
hash function. To insert a tuple, the key of this tuple is hashed with
the first (or primary) hash function to obtain a slot in the primary
table. If this primary slot is available, then the tuple is inserted and
the probe sequence ends. Otherwise, the tuple tries to be inserted in
the second (or secondary) subtable using the second hash function.
If the secondary slot is occupied as well, then a kicking strategy
is applied to evict the existing tuple in either the primary or the
secondary slot, and replace it with the current input tuple. After
that, the evicted tuple is reinserted again, following the same steps.
The eviction chain continues until either all evicted tuples are suc-
cessfully inserted or a maximum chain length is reached. This last
case is a failure; one solution is for all tuples in both hash tables
to be rehashed with two new hash functions.
With balanced kicking [60], the primary or the secondary slot is
randomly selected for eviction. In biased kicking [22, 38], the tuple
in the secondary slot is preferred for eviction, which has been shown
to improve performance for positive lookups. We experimentally
found that biased kicking performs better, so we use it throughout
all our experiments involving cuckoo hashing.
To probe for a tuple, we need only to check the primary and sec-
ondary slots, which yields at most two cache misses regardless of
the load factor. However, a major drawback of the simple variation
of cuckoo hashing is the failure case, where the maximum length of
the eviction chain is reached, happens at low loads. Higher loads can
be handled by generalizing to use more hash tables (e.g., 4 instead
of 2) [31, 66] or allowing multiple tuples per slot [2, 23, 70]. In this
paper, we employ the bucketized variant, where each hash table slot
allows more than one tuple, which again limits to two cache misses
when a bucket fits in a cache line.

COLLISIONS ANALYSIS FOR HASHING
Here, we identify and analyze the factors affecting collisions for
both LMH and traditional hash functions. This analysis helps us
to identify situations where LMH can have fewer collisions than
traditional hash functions. We specifically focus on LMH functions
with piece-wise linear submodels for this analysis.
Notation. For ease of analysis, we start by focusing on the task of
mapping 𝑁keys to 𝑁locations. This analysis readily generalizes,
and the high-level conclusions are independent of this assumption,
with the main difference being the number of locations increases,
the number of collisions decreases. Assume that we apply a hash
function 𝑓onthekeys,where 𝑓couldbeatraditionalhash(Section2)
or a LMH function (Section 3). Let 𝑥0,𝑥1,...,𝑥𝑁−1 be the sorted array
535

of the 𝑁input keys, and let𝑦0,𝑦1,...,𝑦𝑁−1 be the sorted array of the
hashing outputs 𝑓(𝑥0), 𝑓(𝑥1),...,𝑓(𝑥𝑁−1) (note that 𝑦𝑖= 𝑓(𝑥𝑗) for
some 𝑗, but𝑦𝑖is not necessarily 𝑓(𝑥𝑖)). For LMH functions, the𝑦𝑖’s
may be on the real-valued range [0,𝑁), and we would then map each
key to the location corresponding to the value of𝑦𝑖rounded down to
an integer. For convenience, we let𝑦−1 =0. The sorted output values
generate a set of gaps𝑔0,𝑔1,𝑔2,... such that𝑦𝑖=
Í𝑖
𝑡=0𝑔𝑡

. We assume
that 𝑔𝑖’s are i.i.d, with probability density function 𝑓𝐺(𝑧) and CDF
𝐹𝐺(𝑧); this is a reasonable approximation for analysis. For example,
for uniformly randomly distributed outputs 𝑓(𝑥𝑖), the gaps between
𝑦𝑖are approximately exponentially distributed [54].
Characterizing Collisions. A collision occurs when two keys are
mapped to the same location. The key insight regarding collisions
is that they depend on the gaps between consecutive sorted hashing
output values (𝑦𝑖−𝑦𝑖−1). If the gap between two consecutive values
is greater than one (i.e.,𝑦𝑖−𝑦𝑖−1 ≥1), then the corresponding keys
would definitely be placed in separate locations. On the other hand,
if the gap is smaller than one (i.e.,𝑦𝑖−𝑦𝑖−1 ≤1), the corresponding
keys may be mapped to the same location; it depends where𝑦𝑖and
𝑦𝑖−1 relative to the integer boundary.
Ideally, we would want all the gaps to be more than one, to have
zero collisions. However, the gap values are constrained by the con-
dition that the sum of all the gaps should be less than the number of
locations which is 𝑁here.2 Thus, the gap distribution would have
to be the trivial distribution that is always 1 to avoid collisions.
Let𝑐bethenumberofcollidingkeys(i.e.,keysthatarenotalonein
a location). Assuming that 𝑓is not a lattice distribution3, we can de-
scribe the expected number of colliding keys E[𝑐] with the following
lemma. In the below, recall {𝑥}=𝑥−⌊𝑥⌋.

We remark that the proof reveals that this formula is also a good
approximation for large 𝑁.
Proof. Let 𝑍𝑖be the indicator random variable that is 1 if 𝑦𝑖is
alone in its own location. We first consider the position of𝑦𝑖−1. For
sufficiently large 𝑖, {𝑦𝑖−1}, the fractional part of 𝑦𝑖−1, is known to
converge to the uniform distribution on [0,1] (see, e.g., Thm 5.8.4.
of [41]). We therefore treat {𝑦𝑖−1} as being distributed uniformly on
[0,1]. Accordingly, the probability𝑦𝑖is in a different location from

Collisions for Traditional Hash Functions. In case of a truly ran-
dom hash function, the output values will be uniformly distributed
in the range [0,𝑁] irrespective of the input distribution. Therefore,
the gap distribution of the output values is very well approximated
by the exponential distribution with mean 1. Most traditional hash
function displayed this behaviour in our evaluation.
CollisionsforLMH FunctionswithPiece-wiseLinearSubmod-
els. To gain intuition, let us start by using a single linear model to
approximate the CDF of the input data 𝑥0,𝑥1,..., and this will give us
our hash function 𝑓. Let the linear model be𝑚∗(𝑥−𝑥0) where𝑚is
(𝑁−1)/(𝑥𝑁−1−𝑥0). Note that the slope would be approximately the
mean of the gap distribution of the input keys. The resulting hash
function would be ℎ(𝑥) =𝑚∗(𝑥−𝑥0) which maps the input keys
in the range [0,𝑁). After applying this hash function to obtain the
output values𝑦0,𝑦1,..., we notice that the gaps between the output
values are simply the scaled version of the gaps between the input
keys:𝑦𝑖+1−𝑦𝑖= (𝑥𝑖+1−𝑥𝑖)∗𝑚. At a high level, if the input is evenly
spaced, then our outputs will similarly be evenly spaced, resulting
in fewer collisions. If the input gaps are high in variance, we would
expect more collisions. In LMH functions, this scaling would happen
at the submodels scale.
Accordingly, if the data is generated similarly to our theoretical
model, with a gap distribution 𝑔
′ (𝑥0,𝑥1 =𝑥0+𝑔
′
0,𝑥2 =𝑥1+𝑔
′
1,....), the
gap distribution of the input keys determines the gap distribution of
the output keys and thus the amount of collisions. In certain cases,
like auto-generated keys (1,2,3,4,5,...) perhaps with some deletions
or noise, the input gaps are mostly constant. In this scenario, a piece-
wise linear model can lead to fewer collisions than a traditional hash
function. However, if the input keys are generated by sampling from
a distribution instead of sequentially, multiplying the CDF value of
the key by the array size will behave as an order-preserving hash
function. A LMH function that approximates this underlying distri-
bution would behave essentially the same as a truly random hash
function in terms of collisions.
Increasing the number of submodels can improve the accuracy
of when using a piece-wise linear model to approximate a CDF. This
helps in the case of indexing an item, but from our argument above,
we see that this does not necessarily reduce the number of colli-
sions. We show this via an example. We mapped 100 million uniform
randomly and normally distributed keys to 100 million slots using
RMI with varying number of submodels. In Figure 1, we plot the
proportion of collisions as we increase the number of submodels
in RMI. We observe that for uniform randomly distributed keys in-
creasing the number of linear submodels does not affect collision
metric until we reach 50 million submodels. RMIs with 100 submod-
els and 100000 submodels are both able to approximate the CDF
of the distribution well and the output is approximately uniformly
randomly distributed in both cases. The larger RMI provides better
accuracy than the smaller one but essentially the same number of
collisions. The RMI with 50 million submodels essentially memorizes
the empirical CDF of the dataset and thereby results in lower colli-
sions. For the normal distribution, an initial increase in the number
of submodels reduces collisions as an RMI with only 1-2 submodels
fails to approximate the CDF of normal distribution well.

EVALUATION
In this section, we present an empirical study for the performance of
LMH functions and compare them against both traditional and per-
fect hashing. Our main objective is to answer the following question:
what are the main workload characteristics, scenarios, and operations
whereemployingLMHfunctionswouldimproveperformance? Wefirst
study the collisions and computation time tradeoffs (Section 7.2).
Then, we evaluate the performance of the various types of hash
functions in supporting the main hash table operations, lookup and
insertion, for different types of hash tables (Section 7.3). We also
provide more detailed experiments regarding issues such as how
collisions, key types, and payload size affect performance in practice,
as well as the impact of construction time for LMH (Section 7.4). Fi-
nally, we move to some higher-level operations that use hash tables,
and show cases where LMH can improve the performance of range
queries (Section 7.5) and non-partitioned hash join (Section 7.6).
7.1
Experimental Setup
Datasets. We use both real and synthetic key datasets in our exper-
iments. All keys are 64-bit integers4. For real keys, we use the four
datasets from the SOSD benchmark [52]. These datasets are (1) fb,
which has randomly sampled Facebook user IDs, (2) wiki, which
has timestamps of edits from Wikipedia, (3) osm, which has cell IDs
from Open Street Map, and (4) book, which has keys representing
the popularity of books from Amazon. Each dataset has 200 million
keys. In any experiment, we use either the whole dataset or a sample
from it (details are mentioned in each experiment separately).
For synthetic keys, we use four different key generation processes:
(1) gap_10, in which sequential keys are first generated at regular
intervals of 10 and then 10% of the keys are uniformly randomly
4We focus on integer keys in our study. However, for completeness, we provide a single
experiment in Section 7.4 to investigate the performance with string keys.
deleted (this represents the case of auto-generated IDs after removal
of certain users), (2) uniform, in which keys are generated uniformly
atrandomintherange [0,250],(3)normal and(4)lognormal,inwhich
keys are generated from normal (𝜇=100 and 𝜎=20) and lognormal
(𝜇= 0 and 𝜎= 1) distributions, respectively, and then are linearly
scaled to the range [0,250].
As discussed in Section 6, the gaps between sorted hash outputs
determine collisions. In order to understand the distribution of these
gapsinourdatasets,weuseanRMI,with1millionsubmodels,tomap
100 million keys from each dataset to 100 million slots and then plot
thegapsbetweenconsecutivesortedoutputvalues.InFigure2,x-axis
shows the gap value and y-axis shows the count of this gap for some
of the used datasets. We observe that gap_10 and wiki datasets have
gapsconcentratedaround1.uniform,normal,andlognormal datasets
have very similar gap distributions concentrated around 0.25-0.35,
while fb, osm, and book datasets have significant counts of gaps
concentrated around 0.1 (fb and osm have higher counts than book).
In all hash table, range query, and join experiments, we generate
8-byte payloads chosen randomly from the range [0,264]5. All tuples
(or keys) are randomly shuffled before running any experiment.
Hardware. All experiments are conducted in the main memory
on a machine with 256 GB of RAM and an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold
6230 CPU @ 2.10GHz with Skylake micro-architecture (SKX) and
L3 cache of 55MiB. The operating system is Arch Linux with a
page size of 4KB (default page size). The implementation of all
hashing functions and schemes is our own and in C++. The bi-
naries are compiled with clang++ (12.0.1) using optimization -O3.
We have activated prefetching.
Default Settings. Unless otherwise mentioned, we set the number
of submodels in RMI and RadixSpline as stated in Table 1. Each value
represents the least number of submodels needed to give the least
amount of collisions in a specific dataset. For PGM models, we set the
error bound to 10. The number of tuples (or keys) in each synthetic
dataset is set to 100 million. We use a default bucket size of 1 in
bucket chaining. To support cuckoo hashing with a load factor up
to 90%, we use a bucket size of 4 as described in [2]. As mentioned
in Section 5, we use the biased kicking strategy as it performs better
than the balanced one. We set 50000 as a maximum number of kicks.
This value led to a suitably small number of insert failures.
Metrics. Throughput is the default metric in most of the experi-
ments. When studying the hash function itself, we use the compu-
tation throughput, which is the number of hash function operations
executed per second. In the hash table and range query experiments,
we use the number of completed queries (e.g., probe/insert queries
on hash tables) per second (i.e., queries throughput). For the join ex-
periments, we use the runtime instead of the throughput to perform
a breakdown for the join phases.
Measurement and Profiling. For all experiments, we report the
average of three independent runs, where we use a different random
seed for generating and shuffling synthetic and real data, respec-
tively, in each run. We use the PerfEvent library [50] to profile the
low-level hardware counters in Section 7.3. These counters include
L1 and LLC cache misses, branch misses and cycles.
5We focus on 8-byte payloads in our study. However, for completeness, we provide
a single experiment in Section 7.4 to investigate the effect of varying the payload size.
537

Beyond Scope. Our study focuses only on the single-threaded setup
to fairly compare the performance of LMH functions with traditional
and perfect hashing, without parallelism optimizations. That being
said, we believe that multi-threaded implementations of these hash-
ing schemes should be evaluated in a standalone study, which we
currently plan as an extension for this work.
7.2
Computation Throughput vs Collisions
In this experiment, we are interested in studying the tradeoff be-
tween the hash function quality and its efficiency. We use the eleven
hash functions previously discussed and five from our datasets6.
In each dataset, we map a randomly-selected 100 million keys into
100 million hash table slots, and measure both the hash function
computation throughput, and the proportion of colliding keys.
Figure 3 shows the results of this experiment. Note that each tra-
ditional and perfect hash function is represented as a single point in
the scatter plot. However, in LMH functions, we vary (1) the number
of submodels in RMI and RadixSpline from 1 to 50 million and (2) the
error bound of PGM from 1 to 10000, yielding multiple points on the
plot. As expected, traditional hash functions have a significant num-
ber of collisions, and perfect hash functions are slow. All traditional
functions have similar throughput (90-100 million operations/sec)
and colliding keys proportion (0.63-0.65) across all datasets. This
proportion of colliding keys nearly matches that for truly random
hash function which is approximately (1−1/𝑒≈0.632). All perfect
hash functions have no collisions (by definition), but low throughput
(10-20 million operations/sec) due to the high computation overhead
coming from either an expensive traversal over the splitting tree in
RecSplit [28] or multiple random accesses to the array storing the
hypergraph-related values in MWHC [51].
The performance of LMH functions, however, depends on the gap
distribution of the input datasets as discussed in Section 6. The RMI
and RadixSpline hash functions, at their best configurations, can
achieve low collisions (0.2 and 0.3) and high throughput (80 to 120
million operations/sec) in two datasets, gap_10 and wiki. For these
datasets, the gaps are more or less evenly spaced, and hence LMH
functions yield a very low number of collisions. In addition, the num-
ber of submodels needed for these datasets is small, which makes the
LMH computation overhead efficient. For fb, the variance in the gap
distributionisveryhigh,yieldingalargenumberofcollisions.Reduc-
ing these collisions requires using a large number of submodels (the
best proportion of colliding keys is 0.5), yielding low throughput.
In the case of uniform and normal datasets, we observe that LMH
and traditional functions have similar collision behavior, regardless
of the used number of submodels. This matches our understanding
that the CDF-based hashing of LMH for these datasets will lead to a
distribution of items in buckets that is nearly the same as traditional
hashing (as described in Section 6). In general, as discussed in Sec-
tion 6, increasing the number of submodels in LMH functions does
not necessarily decrease the collisions. For example, in wiki, the pro-
portion of colliding keys using RMI significantly drops from 0.9 to 0.3
after an initial increase in the number of submodels from 1 to 1000,
and then becomes stable regardless the number of submodels used.
For the rest of our experiments, we compare LMH functions with
the best traditional and perfect hash functions, in terms of both

computation time and collisions: Murmur and MultiplyPrime for
traditional hashing, and MWHC for perfect hashing.
7.3
Hash Table Performance
Here, we are interested in studying the performance of two main
hash table operations; probe and insert.
Probe Throughput. In this experiment, we first insert 100 million
tuples in a hash table with varying number of slots (i.e., buckets).
Then, we probe the hash table with all the inserted tuples (i.e., query
workload), after randomly shuffling them, and measure the through-
put.Wegeneratedifferentloadfactorsbyvaryingthenumberofslots.
Figure 4 shows the results for this experiment while using seven
input datasets (uniform and normal nearly have the same results).
For each hashing scheme, we use a different range of load factors
that are suitable for the scheme. For example, we use load factors
≥100% in bucket chaining as it can support inserting tuples more
than the total slots in a hash table. Also, we only use high load factors
(≥75%) with cuckoo hashing because, in smaller load factors, cuckoo
hashing is always dominated by other schemes [66].
For bucket chaining, RMI has the best throughput in gap_10, nor-
mal, lognormal, and wiki datasets, averaging 1.4x better throughput
than the second best function, whether it is MultiplyPrime or RadixS-
pline. This is because RMI has the fewest collisions in these four
datasets. Fewer collisions result in shorter chains that need to be
traversed during the probe queries, and hence fewer cache misses.
In addition, both PGM and MWHC have the worst throughput in
gap_10 and wiki datasets due to their high computation overhead7.
For RadixSpline, we observe an interesting variance in performance
in these datasets. It is competitive with RMI throughput in non-
skewed datasets (gap_10 and wiki), but becomes the worst in the
skewed datasets (normal and lognormal). This is because in skewed
datasets outlier keys lead to having a large radix table with a majority
of its entries being useless (i.e., more data structure overhead and
cachemissesduringlookups).ThisweaknessofRadixSplinehasbeen
noted in [52]. In fb, osm, and book datasets, we observe a clear rank-
ing among the different hash functions. Although MWHC still has
thehighestcomputationoverhead,LMH functionsbecometheworst
options (except book in which RMI is slightly better than MWHC)
withanaveragethroughputofonly2.5millionqueries/sec.Thisisbe-
cause of the high number of collisions for LMH functions when used
with these datasets that have high variance in their gaps distribution.
We also look at the throughput across different load factors. In-
creasing the load factor increases collisions because there are fewer
slots, which degrades the throughput. For example, Murmur has
throughputs of 16 and 8.5 million queries/sec at load factors of 25%
and 200%, respectively. However, we observe two exceptions to this
throughputtrendwhenusing:(1)RMIandRadixSplineatloadfactors
between 25% and 100% in gap_10 and wiki, where the throughput
actually increases, and (2) MWHC in all load factors, where the
throughput is fixed around 8 million queries/sec, regardless of the
dataset.Thereasonforthefirstexceptionisthatcollisionsarealready
close to zero in these two datasets, so increasing the load factor from
25% to 100% primarily reduces empty hash table slots, leading to
better caching behavior. The reason for the second exception is that

and (C) cuckoo hashing. Results are shown for 7 different datasets, and various load factors for each hashing scheme.
the MWHC computation overhead for each tuple is constant [51],
regardless of the used load factor.
For linear probing, the throughput depends on the length of the
sequential scan needed to handle collisions. We observe that the
throughputsachievedbyusingMurmur,MultiplyPrime,andMWHC
have the same trend as in bucket chaining. In contrast, RMI and
RadixSpline have the following two notable changes. First, their
performance gain over traditional hashing in gap_10 decreases or
even vanishes (e.g., they yield 10% less throughput in normal and
lognormal). Although the number of collisions using LMH func-
tions is slightly smaller in these datasets (Section 7.2), the effect of
this difference can be hidden by the sequential scan benefits (e.g.,
prefetching) of linear probing, and hence the overhead of RMI and
RadixSpline hash computation becomes more significant. Second,
RMI and RadixSpline result in worse throughput than traditional
hashing in wiki (average 40% less throughput than MultiplyPrime).
This was a bit surprising as LMH functions result in significantly
fewercollisionsthantraditionalhashing.However,wefoundthatina
fewpartsofthewiki datasetRMImapsupto100keystothesameslot,
creating clusters that result in long sequential scans during probing.
For cuckoo hashing, we observe that the throughputs achieved by
any hash function are pretty much similar within the same dataset,
regardless of the load factor used. This is expected as handling col-
lisions in cuckoo hashing is typically performed in constant time
(two cache misses at most). Even better, we employ a biased kicking
strategy, in which most of the tuples are placed in their primary hash
slots (i.e., one cache miss for most of the probes). This makes the hash
function computation (model prediction in case of LMH functions)
have a great impact on the probe latency in cuckoo hashing, and
explains why the throughput using LMH functions is worse than
using traditional hashing in all datasets, except in gap_10 and wiki
where RMI is almost similar to Murmur. Note that using RMI failed
to construct the cuckoo hash table for fb and osm (similarly, RadixS-
pline and PGM failed in fb, osm, and book at load factors > 90%)
because the resulting number of collisions is extremely high, and
the required number of kicks to handle them exceeds the maximum
threshold. For traditional hashing, we also noticed that Murmur
succeeded in constructing the hash tables in all datasets, while the
construction failed using MultiplyPrime at load factor 95% because
of highnumberof collisions. Ingeneral, cuckoo hashingsignificantly

schemes used in Figure 4, yet for wiki and fb datasets only.
reduces the impact of collisions, regardless of the hash function used,
and hence the performance improvement of LMH over traditional
hashing becomes negligible.
Insert Throughput. Here, we use the same setup in the probe
throughput experiment, while changing the query workload. To gen-
erate the insert workload, we first uniformly and randomly sample
101 million tuples from an input dataset. Then, we initialize the hash
table by bulk-inserting 100 million tuples from this sample as in the
probethroughputexperiment,andusetheremaining1milliontuples
as the query workload. Figure 5 shows the results of this experiment
for two input datasets only, wiki and fb (the remaining datasets show
similar performance trends).
In general, the relative ranking and throughput trends remain the
same as in the probe throughput experiment (including the failure
cases in cuckoo hashing). We also observe that, in wiki, the per-
formance benefit that RMI offers over MultiplyPrime - when used
with bucket chaining - in insertion is not as high as in probing (only
an average of 10% throughput improvement in insertion compared
to 30% in probing). Probing time mainly depends on the length of
the chain to be traversed whereas insertion requires allocating and
adding new buckets to the chain, and hence the collision reduction
improves only a portion of the total insert time. Another interesting
observation is that at load factor 95% using cuckoo hashing with
MWHC is the best as the overhead of kicking operations becomes
higher than the complex computation of MWHC.
Performance Counters. To deeply understand what happens on
the hardware level, we investigate the following four performance
counters: cycles, L1 cache misses, last-level cache (LLC) misses, and
branch misses. Figure 6 shows the average values of these counters
per tuple when using RMI, MultiplyPrime and MWHC in the probe
throughput experiment (Figure 4) at load factor 80% and only for two

experiment in Figure 4 using the gap_10 (first row) and fb

datasets gap_10 (first row) and fb (second row). For MWHC, we only
show chained results as other schemes have similar performance.
For gap_10, the three RMI-based variants achieve the lowest per-
formance counter values (e.g., one L1/LLC miss per tuple for RMI-
CHAIN and RMI-LP) compared to other variants. This is because the
number of submodels needed for any LMH function is only 10 (as
shown in Table 1), which can totally fit in the cache. For fb, we found
that scanning very large clusters, as in RMI-LP or MULT-LP, signifi-
cantly increases both cache and branch misses, and in turn increases
cycles (high cache and branch misses lead to an excessive increase in
theamountofCPUstallsandwastedcycles,respectively).Incontrast,

confirms our conclusion about the impact of hashing schemes on the
probe throughput using LMH functions. Another interesting obser-
vation in fb is that MULT-CHAIN and MULT-CUCKOO have close

More Performance Analysis
In this section, we study more parameters related to LMH functions
and their performance in hash tables.
540

Figure 8: Effect of increasing the bucket capacity on the probe
throughput of a chained hash table at load factor of 50%.
Gap Distribution. In this experiment, we vary the gap distribution
to display that gaps concentrated around the mean have lower colli-
sions. Assuming that the variance of the gap distribution of uniform
keys is 𝑋, we generate 4 different variations of the uniform dataset,
such that the gap distribution variances of their keys are 2𝑋, 4𝑋,
0.5𝑋and 0.25𝑋(i.e., scaled variances) 8. Then, we insert the keys
of each dataset variation in a hash table using RMI, and calculate
the proportion of colliding keys. The left part of Figure 7 shows the
proportion of colliding keys with varying load factors. As expected,
the amount of collisions can be decreased by decreasing either de-
creasing the gap variance or the load factor. Lower gap variance
cause the gap distribution to concentrate around the mean value
resulting in lower collisions.
Build Time. Unlike traditional hash functions, LMH and perfect
hash functions require a building stage. In the right part of Figure 7,
we show the building time for LMH and MWHC functions using the
uniform dataset, varying the number of keys between 106 and 108.
We see that the building time of MWHC is consistently 2.5 and 2
orders of magnitude slower than the building times of RMI (or PGM)
and RadixSpline, respectively. Although MWHC has an expected
O(𝑛) construction time [51], its hypergraph building process re-
quires an excessive amount of random memory accesses, and hence
cache misses (check Section 4). In contrast, building LMH functions
requires only sorting the data once and doing multiple sequential
passes over it, which is a cache-friendly process.
Bucket Capacity. In this experiment, we study how increasing the
bucket capacity (i.e., number of tuples in the bucket) affects the probe
throughput. For each dataset, we build different hash tables with a
load factor of 50%, and are bulk-loaded with 100 million tuples. Note,
since we fix the load factor, increasing the bucket capacity by a factor
𝑋reduces the number of buckets by a factor 1
𝑋. We use the same
inserted tuples as a probe workload, after randomly shuffling them,
and measure the throughput as in Figure 8.
In bucket chaining, increasing the bucket capacity reduces the
length of needed chains (i.e., extra buckets) to handle collisions, as
any colliding key now has a high probability to be in the main hash
table bucket. However, this increases the probe time as well because
finding a key in the bucket requires larger scan overhead as the
bucket becomes larger. In wiki, LMH functions already produce a
low number of collisions, and hence increasing the bucket capacity
will not benefit chaining, yet causes probes to scan unnecessary keys,
8Each dataset variation is generated by scaling the gaps between the uniform keys
with the corresponding factor (e.g., the "2𝑋Variance" dataset scales the gaps between
uniform keys by a factor of 2).
Figure 9: (1) Effect of payload size on the probe throughput
(left), and (2) Computation throughput and collisions tradeoff
when using string keys (right).
and hence the throughput significantly decreases (this is also true
for MWHC as it has no collisions by definition). We can see that
RMI and RadixSpline are affected more than PGM because their hash
computation is lighter, and hence the effect of collision handling,
with any extra overhead, becomes more obvious in the total probe
time. In fb, LMH produces a lot of collisions that result in longer
chains. In this case, increasing the bucket capacity improves the
probe throughput a bit. In the case of Murmur and MultiplyPrime,
they significantly suffer from the extra scan overhead within the
bucket only beyond size of 4.
Payload Size. Here, we study the effect of increasing the payload
size on the probe throughput of hash tables built with different hash
functions. In this experiment, we use the wiki dataset and a chaining
scheme with a 100% load factor. For each hash function, the hash
tables are built and probed as described in the bucket capacity ex-
periment, yet, with tuples of different payload sizes: 4, 8, 16 and 64
bytes. The left part of Figure 9 shows the probe throughput (x-axis
has a logscale). As expected, increasing the payload size significantly
reduces the probe throughput of all functions, except MWHC and
PGM, in which the overhead of cache misses (coming from accessing
payloads) does not affect their already high computation time until
the payloads become very large (e.g., 64 bytes).
String Keys. Workloads with string keys are common in the real-
world (e.g., [5, 16]). Unfortunately, learned models and indexes have
no efficient support for string keys. The most relevant work in this
area is RadixStringSpline (RSS) [76], which constructs a tree of radix
splines, each indexing a fixed number of bytes in the string. Here, we
investigate the robustness of RSS against Murmur, which is known
for its efficiency in hashing strings. We repeat the computation
throughput-collisions experiment (Section 7.2), while using two
string datasets: (1) Emails, which is a real-world email dataset used
in [12], and (2) URLs, which is a dataset of Wikipedia URL tails used
in [76]. The right part of Figure 9 shows the results of this experi-
ment. We can see that RSS, at its best configurations, can actually
achieve 28% lower collisions than Murmur but with extremely slow
computation throughputs. This slowness is because strings typically
have both long shared prefixes and relatively low discriminative
content per byte, which require a very large number of submodels
(i.e., tree nodes) in the RSS to capture the strings distribution.
7.5
Range Queries Performance
Hash tables support fast point queries, and do not support range
queries. On the other hand, index structures like B-Tree, ART [46],
and RMI [43] support both point and range queries. However, the
541

and range query size (second row) on the queries throughput.
performance of index structures in point queries is not as efficient as
hash tables. In case of a mixed workload of point and range queries,
where range queries represent only a small proportion, one cannot
use a hash table and is forced to use an index to be able to answer
the range queries. This results in a huge performance degradation
for the majority of the point queries. Fortunately, we can use "mono-
tonic" LMH functions, such as RMI and RadixSpline, along with
bucket chaining to build a hash table that supports range queries in
addition to its natural support for fast point queries. In this case, a
range query can be processed by scanning the buckets between the
locations corresponding to the query lower and upper bound keys.

a mixed workload by first randomly sampling 𝑋% of the input data
to be used as point queries, and then the rest(i.e., 100-𝑋%) are used
to generate random range queries that retrieve about 25-50 tuples
(shown in upper half of Figure 10). In both wiki and fb, RMI-CHAIN
and RadixSpline-CHAIN have faster throughput than RMI-SORT
when the workload has a majority of point queries, and vice versa.
This is because for a point query, they just need to scan the bucket
pointed out by the model, whereas RMI-SORT needs a local search
to find the key. For a range query, RMI-CHAIN and RadixSpline-
CHAIN scan the buckets that fall within the range query and the
chains associated with them. This leads to random memory accesses,
and a decrease in the throughput. In contrast, RMI-SORT only needs
to sequentially scan the relevant keys in the sorted range.
Range Query Size. Here, we reuse the setup of the previous experi-
ment, while focusing only on 100% range queries workload. We vary
the range query size from 1 to 1024. The bottom half of Figure 10
shows the results for this experiment (x-axis has a logscale). With
Figure 11: Runtime breakdown for the different implementa-
tions of non-partitioned hash join using various hash tables.
increasing the range size, RMI-CHAIN and RadixSpline-CHAIN be-
come slower than RMI-SORT as they need to scan additional chained
buckets.

Hash-based Join Performance
In this experiment, we are interested in understanding the perfor-
manceofnon-partitionedhashjoin(NPJ)overtwoinputrelations[44,
79]. Note that we do not investigate partitioned hash join [72, 79] as
it employs small cache-fit hash tables and using any traditional hash
function will be the best choice. In contrast, NPJ builds a large global
hash table for the smaller input relation and the probability of having
performance degradation, due to large number of collisions, is high.
Therefore, employing an efficient hash function is crucial to improve
the join performance. We use wiki and fb datasets, where we uni-
formly and randomly sample two variations from each dataset with
10M and 25M tuples. These variations will be used to perform the
NPJ on, using the best function in each hashing category. Figure 11
shows the running time of the NPJ build and probe phases.
Interestingly,wecanobservethatRMI-CHAINandMULT-CHAIN
have the best join performance in both wiki and fb. Specifically, RMI-
CHAIN has 28% less total runtime (build and probe) than MULT-
CHAIN in wiki (e.g., in the 25Mx25M variant, the build times of
RMI-CHAIN and MULT-CHAIN are 3.2 and 4.3 sec, while their probe
times are 1.488 and 2.193 sec, respectively), and they both have the
same total runtime in fb. Looking at the build phase, we can see that
RMI-CHAIN and RMI-LP build the hash table more efficiently. This
is because RMI sorts the data to build its submodels, and then uses
them to insert each tuple. Although sorting the data is a bit expen-
sive, it helps the model-based insertion to happen in a cache-friendly
manner, and is significantly less than randomly inserting tuples (i.e.,
more cache misses) using MultiplyPrime and Murmur. Due to the
efficiency of RMI in building the hash table, the total time of NPJ
using RMI-CHAIN becomes more competitive with MULT-CHAIN
in a challenging dataset like fb because the performance gain in
building compensates for the performance degradation in probing,
and the total running time becomes very close.

RELATED WORK
Traditional Hashing. Traditional hash functions can be catego-
rized as either non-cryptographic [29] or cryptographic [1]. Non-
cryptographic hash functions [2, 18–20, 42, 66, 68, 70], which we
mainly focus on in our study, are mostly used in building data struc-
tures and algorithms due to their good balance between computation
time and collision rates. More recent work has focused on optimizing
theperformanceofnon-cryptographichashingonmodernhardware
by either proposing new hash functions [80] (e.g., CLHash [47], and
tabulation hashing [64]) or customizing the existing ones to utilize
the underlying hardware (e.g., GPU [48] and SIMD vectorization [9,
34]).Cryptographic hashfunctionshavethepropertyofbeingcompu-
tationally hard to invert (e.g., MD5 [67], SHA1 [27] and SipHash [7]).
These functions can still be used in building data structures, yet their
performance can be much slower than non-cryptographic ones [18].
Perfect Hashing. Perfect hashing has been widely studied; see, e.g.,
the survey in [51]. Perfect hashing solutions can be divided into two
categories: static and dynamic. When inserting new tuples to the
hash table, the static solutions (e.g., [14, 28, 51, 61]) reconstruct the
whole table from scratch, while the dynamic solutions (e.g., [21, 81])
reconstruct the table parts that are related to the update only.
Learned Models for Indexing and Hashing. During the last few
years, the idea of using CDF-based learned models to replace tradi-
tional indexes has been investigated extensively including single-
dimension (e.g., [30, 40, 43]), multi-dimensional (e.g., [24, 57]), updat-
able (e.g., [25]), and spatial (e.g., [49, 62, 65]) indexes. Interestingly,
the authors of [43] also discussed the idea of using learned mod-
els as order-preserving hash functions further investigated by the
study [70]. In contrast, our proposed study is more comprehensive as
it spans additional hash function types, hashing schemes, workload
types,andhash-basedoperations.Anotherrecentwork[36]employs
an entropy-learned approach to reduce the hashing overhead.
HashingExperimentalStudies.SMHasher[80]isawidely-known
test-suite for evaluating non-cryptographic hash functions. [78]
provided both theoretical and experimental analysis for crypto-
graphic hash functions. [2] did a detailed experimental comparison
between the performance of two hashing schemes (cuckoo hashing
and quadratic probing) and two radix tree variations. [73] micro-
benchmarkedtheperformanceofSIMD-awarevariationsofdifferent
hashingschemes.[66]isanotherrecentcomprehensiveexperimental
study for the different combinations of hash functions and schemes.
However, it only focused on non-cryptographic traditional hash
functions and hash table operations. For learned models, they have
been extensively benchmarked in [52] for indexing only, and not for
hashing. In this paper, we try to fill this gap.

LESSONS LEARNED AND FUTURE WORK
Gaps distribution matters for LMH collisions. Assuming the in-
put keys are sorted, collisions of LMH functions (that employ linear
submodels) depend on the distribution of gaps between consecu-
tive sorted keys. The more evenly spaced these gaps are, the fewer
collisions LMH functions have; in fact there can be fewer collisions
than traditional hashing. When data is from typical distributions
(e.g., normal), we observe that LMH functions have a similar (or even
higher) number of collisions compared to traditional hashing.
Number of submodels matters for LMH efficiency. Building an
LMH function with very few submodels (fewer than a certain thresh-
old) reduces its accuracy, as it will not capture the input distribution
effectively. On the other hand, increasing the number of submodels
decreases the computation throughput. For datasets with evenly
spaced gaps, tuned LMH functions can achieve the best tradeoff
between computation throughput and collisions, compared to tradi-
tional and perfect hash functions, as shown in Section 7.2. Generally
speaking, RMI is the best in achieving this tradeoff, while PGM is
the worst. For RadixSpline, it depends on the dataset skewness. The
more skewed the dataset is, the worse the RadixSpline performance.
Throughputsofbuilding/probinghashtablesusingLMH func-
tions vary across different hashing schemes. Collision reduc-
tion due to LMH translates to improved hash table probe and insert
throughputs, more evident with bucket chaining, and diminish with
cuckoo hashing, as shown in Section 7.3. We also found that RMI
and MultiplyPrime are the best LMH and traditional hash functions,
respectively, to use along with bucket chaining in all load factors
ranging from 20% to 200%.
For string keys, traditional hashing is better than LMH. Effi-
cient support for strings in learned models is still an open research
question. RSS [76], which is a preliminary attempt, shows a signif-
icantly less hash computation throughput than traditional hashing
due to the difficulty of modeling strings that typically have long
shared prefixes and relatively low discriminative content per byte.
Efficient support of LMH for mixed workloads of point and
range queries as well as non-partitioned hash join (NPJ). Any
monotonic (i.e., order-preserving) LMH function, along with bucket
chaining,canbeusedtobuildonehashtableforefficientlyanswering
both point and range queries at the same time (i.e., mixed workloads).
In fact, using LMH functions along with chaining is also more ef-
ficient than other traditional options in building and probing the
shared hash table in NPJ. Among the different LMH-based variants,
RMI-CHAIN shows the most efficient and robust performance.
Future Directions. The multi-threaded implementations and eval-
uations of LMH, perfect hashing, and traditional hash tables remains
open. Also, our study primarily focused on piece-wise linear models,
and more complex models like decision trees and neural networks
may lead to different and further interesting tradeoffs.
