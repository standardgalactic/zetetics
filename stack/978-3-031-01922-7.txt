The aim of Synthese Library is to provide a forum for the best current work in the 
methodology and philosophy of science and in epistemology, all broadly understood. 
A wide variety of different approaches have traditionally been represented in the 
Library, and every effort is made to maintain this variety, not for its own sake, but 
because we believe that there are many fruitful and illuminating approaches to the 
philosophy of science and related disciplines.
Special attention is paid to methodological studies which illustrate the interplay 
of empirical and philosophical viewpoints and to contributions to the formal 
(logical, set-theoretical, mathematical, information-theoretical, decision-theoretical, 
etc.) methodology of empirical sciences. Likewise, the applications of logical 
methods to epistemology as well as philosophically and methodologically relevant 
studies in logic are strongly encouraged. The emphasis on logic will be tempered by 
interest in the psychological, historical, and sociological aspects of science.  In 
addition to monographs Synthese Library publishes thematically unified anthologies 
and edited volumes with a well-defined topical focus inside the aim and scope of the 
book series. The contributions in the volumes are expected to be focused and 
structurally organized in accordance with the central theme(s), and should be tied 
together by an extensive editorial introduction or set of introductions if the volume 
is divided into parts. An extensive bibliography and index are mandatory.

Introduction: Externalist Perspectives 
on Ignorance and Cognition
Selene Arfini and Lorenzo Magnani
Abstract  The externalist currents in cognitive science have overturned different 
assumptions regarding how our cognition works: disembodiment, computational-
ism, and representationalism have been dethroned as untouchable premises and 
openly discussed from both ontological and epistemological perspectives. To be 
sure, different good old-fashioned concepts such as knowledge, information, and 
belief have been adapted to resonate in embodied, extended, and distributed per-
spectives on cognition. Ignorance, conversely, still needs to be adequately addressed 
in this new light. This volume aims at rethinking the analysis of ignorance, viewing 
it through the lens of an externalist take on cognition. To do so, authors working 
from different disciplines and perspectives discuss the features, definitions, and 
instances of ignorance, considering its role in the agents’ embodied, extended, and 
distributed cognitive states and processes. Given this approach’s novelty and com-
plexity, this introductory chapter provides a preliminary discussion regarding the 
current research in Ignorance Studies and how the investigation of ignorance can 
open further lines of research in different externalist approaches. This chapter also 
briefly introduces the other contributors’ work and establishes an encompassing 
perspective on the volume’s content.

1.1  Introduction
Recently, ignorance has become a topic of increasing interest in philosophy and 
related research fields. Agnotology (Proctor & Schiebinger, 2008), the epistemol-
ogy of ignorance (Kourany, 2015), and, more generally, Ignorance Studies (Gross &

McGoey, 2015) have grown to cover and explore different phenomena and subjects 
of research, from known events in history and sociology of science to the investiga-
tion of ordinary reasoning and cognitive processes. Absence or lack of knowledge 
does not seem to encompass the lately acknowledged events that can be defined as 
ignorance-correlated occurrences (Haas & Vogt, 2015). Misunderstanding, miscon-
ception, delusions, irrational beliefs, and ignorance-based inferences and models 
(as fallacious reasoning, but also heuristics and predictions) are now fruitfully stud-
ied under the comprehensive terminology of ignorance (Arfini, 2020).
Although interested scholars have variously discussed ignorance phenomena and 
their impact on cognition, mind states, and cognitive processes, most have adopted 
a merely internalist perspective to approach these themes. Meanwhile, even though 
externalist perspectives on cognition flourished in recent literature (Carter et al., 
2014), authors exploring them have paid little attention to the emerging field of 
Ignorance Studies. Ignorance has been generally left out from the inquiries on the 
extension of cognitive states, cognitive processes, and predictive reasoning. For 
example, one of the founding goals of the extended mind thesis was to understand 
how some cognitive states extend beyond the thin layer of the agents’ skin in their 
environment (Menary, 2010; Clark & Chalmers, 1998). Notwithstanding this ambi-
tious aim, some problematic cognitive states such as doubt and hypothetical and 
false beliefs have not been explicitly part of this investigation.
Some authors have already begun addressing the topic of ignorance in their 
research on distributed cognition and on inquiries about cognitive niche construc-
tion and maintenance (Arfini, 2019; Werner, 2021). In the field of study that encom-
passes creative reasoning and serendipitous discoveries, some papers and research 
have also discussed how understanding ignorance can enlighten how these cognitive 
processes are possible (Copeland, 2018; Ross & Vallée-Tourangeau, 2020). So, lit-
tle steps have progressed on acquiring a more comprehensive perspective on igno-
rant cognition. Still, the cognitive and philosophical literature lacks a bold and 
theoretically oriented project to which these efforts may find an appropriate venue 
for discussion.
Thus, we believe that it is time to fill this research gap. In this volume, we seek 
to merge the two growing areas of research: Ignorance Studies and externalist takes 
on cognition. We know that different and sometimes contrasting approaches com-
pose cognitive externalism’s various schools of thought. The extended mind theory 
alone has several debating voices (Colombo et al., 2019), not to mention the ongo-
ing discussions about the limits and research possibilities of embodied, embedded, 
distributed, and symbiotic cognition (Slors, 2019). We still believe that the common 
ground for describing cognitive features, processes, and states as encapsulated in 
more than just the individual and intracranial brain should address the uncomfort-
able themes that pertain to ignorance and related phenomena, not as a dividing topic 
but as a common area of interest. Thus, this edited volume can provide much food 
for thoughts to cognitive scientists and philosophers alike, enriching the current 
range and reach of both Ignorance Studies and externalist approaches to cognition.

1.2  Interactions Between Externalisms 
and Ignorance Studies
While all authors who adopt externalists perspectives usually acknowledge that 
these also contrast some aspects of the traditional cognitivist take on cognition, this 
is nearly the only thing that unites them. It is, in fact, beyond doubt that the pro-
posed considerations in externalist theories of cognition are not necessarily cohe-
sive and can be even inconsistent on some levels. Thus, we as editors had to make a 
strangely tricky choice regarding the internal divisions of this volume: While any 
externalist take on ignorance fitted this volume’s aim, we knew that different views, 
as extended, embodied, enactive, and distributed accounts on cognition, would have 
brought forward distinct and not necessarily compatible ideas on ignorance. So, a 
pressing question emerged: Should we put them all together or divide them up by 
the externalist perspective the authors adopt?
The answer emerged when we realized that most contributors did not insist on a 
specific view on cognition but aimed at discussing the notion of ignorance beyond 
the tradition that sees it as an individual, intracranial, and fixed condition of cogni-
tive agents. Thus, different chapters in this volume present views that resonate with 
more than one externalist perspective and, more interestingly, lay ground for theo-
retical discussions on ignorant states and processes beyond the strict distinctions 
between externalists’ viewpoints. This also allowed us, as editors, to see the volume 
as a merging field of different ideas, in which some views that relate to how we 
consider cognitive efforts and processes are introduced and discussed in other chap-
ters, without necessarily creating inconsistencies or contrasting alternatives.
Moreover, the multidisciplinary nature of this volume also contributed to differ-
ences in style, methodology, and focus without creating barriers of meanings 
between chapters. Instead, different authors borrowed concepts and discussions 
from philosophy, sociology, psychology, digital studies, and anthropology, making 
this volume genuinely reflect the multifaced approaches of current cognitive science 
research.
Thus, dividing this volume by externalist approaches or disciplinary backgrounds 
would have arbitrarily restricted the range of theoretical proposals that most contri-
butions advanced in the common interest of treating ignorance as a critical notion in 
the expanding and far-reaching research on cognition. What we have decided to do 
instead was to present the volume’s chapters acknowledging their different disci-
plinary and externalist starting points while also recognizing their connections and 
original integrations. In the following subsections, we will briefly describe all chap-
ters’ intents and subjects and discuss how they are interconnected, since they reflect 
on the same externalists’ viewpoints or put forward arguments concerning the same 
disciplinary areas.
1  Introduction: Externalist Perspectives on Ignorance and Cognition

4
1.2.1  Relational Ignorance: A New Focus 
for Ethical Discussions
Usually, academic discussions on ignorance focus on the states or processes that 
lead to ignorance without considering the ignorant persons, their desires, goals, and 
intentions as a relevant part of the investigation. Instead, when distinguishing who 
is ignorant and who knows something becomes invaluable to study the state of igno-
rance – as, for example, in the fields of agnotology or epistemology of ignorance 
(both aim at acknowledging when groups of people are kept ignorant of something 
relevant by others for different purposes), the focus is on the loss of agency and 
autonomy of the agent who is kept ignorant. In the second chapter of this book, 
Samantha Copeland dramatically changes the viewpoint from which we can reflect 
on the role of ignorance from a social and cognitive perspective. Instead of asking 
“what are the cognitive costs of ignorance?” she focuses on why people could 
choose to be ignorant of something (or unlearn some skills) and which kind of cog-
nitive and social negotiations they need to make to share their epistemic load.
She convincingly argues that ignorance plays an everyday role in our lives, 
depending heavily on our relationships with other people and with cognitive arti-
facts. In her words: “relational ignorance lies at the intersection of the cognitive and 
the social”: issues of trust, self-trust, responsibility, and autonomy become inter-
twined with the realization that sometimes people want and need to be ignorant of 
things they would need to know because they have – deliberately or not – delegated 
the responsibility to know them to other people, and even objects, in their cognitive 
and social system. The chapter’s sections illustrate these epistemic bonds by refer-
ring to the theoretical framework of distributed, embodied, social cognition, and the 
extended mind. Indeed, while negotiating who needs to have or share the epistemic 
load and credit appears like a social issue, the idea that we can rely on other people 
and artifacts “to know for us” some things relevant for our day-to-day life becomes 
a discussion for externalist epistemology. In this regard, not only does it matter what 
we know and what we delegate others to know, but also what we know about these 
people and artifacts we delegate to, how much we can trust them, and how much this 
knowledge they have is a burden to them or not.
Thus, Copeland invites us to step on the side of ethics by discussing epistemo-
logical and cognitive issues, asking us to address the not-so-comfortable idea that 
our state of ignorance ethically matters even when it is not an impediment or a limi-
tation for us. The switch in perspective allows us to see that sometimes people want 
to be individually ignorant of something because they delegate that knowledge to 
others, creating cases of unfair epistemic exploitation. This discussion is even more 
interesting because it proposes that not always who knows also exploits and not 
always who stays ignorant is also exploited. This realization opens a new focus for 
ethical discussion in Ignorance Studies and, at the same time, demands to closely 
explore the ethical side of distributed, social, and extended cognition. While differ-
ent scholars are now trying to uncover the hidden complexities of ignorance, being 
concerned about epistemic labor and who can take it is a welcome and unex-
pected twist.
S. Arfini and L. Magnani

1.2.2  Creative Ignorance: The Unexpected Value 
of the Uncomfortable State of Not-Knowing
The distribution of epistemic labor and credit is a crucial point also of Wendy Ross’ 
chapter. Challenging the definition of a creative act as the mere and linear progress 
from ignorance to knowledge, she addresses and discusses in depth the different 
elements that compose the system in which a cognitive and creative activity is per-
formed. She describes creativity as situated, which means acknowledging not only 
the efforts and credit of the individual agents who creatively act, produce, or decide 
something, but also what and who in their environment allowed, triggered, and con-
tributed to that creative result. It also means that creativity cannot be understood just 
by referring to the concept of insight: not only this notion reduces (when it does not 
deny) the epistemic and cognitive contributions of resources external to the subject 
in the creative process, but it also assumes that once insight is achieved, the creative 
act is almost completed, and the agents, the artists, have already in their head all the 
knowledge they need to finish their work. Following this reasoning, the creative 
process is nothing more than transposing one’s ingenious idea to matter. It is a 
shame that it is not what happens when actual artists work and achieve creative 
solutions.
As Ross reports by commenting on her and others’ (Glăveanu, 2013) previous 
works, it is not unusual to see the objects and matter “resist the intentions of the 
artist. All of a sudden, objects “ask a question” and very often “change the original 
plan,” being “stronger” than the creator, “imposing their rules.”” (p. 5). This mate-
rial resistance is what Ross also calls “material engagement” and “material agency,” 
which needs to be credited for not a small part of the creative process, since, without 
that, we would only have (often but not always) just the internal insight of the agent 
without any creative product to show. At the same time, the material agency also 
complicates our epistemological understanding of the creative process: if insight is 
not the pinnacle of the creative act and the resistance of the material object radically 
affects and changes the plans, intentions, and processes of the creators or artists, 
then also creativity – understood as a progress from the ignorance of not knowing 
what to do to the knowledge of the successful solution reached – needs to change. 
Ross emphatically notes that “out of the laboratory,” it is not usual not to have just 
one correct answer to a problem, or not to know which solution is right, or not to 
know how to verify the soundness of a particular solution. More often than not, 
agents stay in a state of ignorance, which is only different from the previous state of 
not-knowing because, after the creative process, they have produced something: a 
solution, an object, a response to a problem. Thus, describing creativity as situated 
means refusing to see a creative solution as the end of ignorance: instead, Ross 
urges us to acknowledge the “uncomfortable ignorance” that persists after the cre-
ative process is done as something that artists crave and nourish their efforts endeav-
ors. In her words:

The generation of novelty cannot occur without an active embrace of uncertainty and igno-
rance. This is evidenced by the reports of creative people who actively seek to put them-
selves in a place of ignorance not because they wish to hide from uncomfortable knowledge 
but because uncomfortable ignorance supports creative understanding. In this domain, 
ignorance does not stem from epistemic laziness nor is it a helpful prop, rather is it one of 
the underlying aims of the creative process.
Then, what she describes as “creative ignorance” in this chapter is another way to 
rethink the relationship between the agents, their cognitive efforts, their environ-
ment, and the concepts of ignorance and knowledge in an externalist way. Once the 
perspective changes, of course, new questions emerge, such as what makes artists 
stop working on a project and call it finished or how creative ignorance can lead 
agents from one project to another one. So, it is interesting to note that her chapter, 
as now part of our extended cognitive system, contributes to our state of wondering 
and uncomfortable ignorance.
1.2.3  Extended Ignorance: The Limits of Propositional 
Ignorance in Extended Cognition
Extended cognition is also at the center of Duncan Pritchard’s chapter, which adopts 
a definition of ignorance that is often applied in analytic epistemology: proposi-
tional ignorance as the absence of knowledge or true beliefs. Since this description 
usually refers to an internalist view of cognitive states, this chapter proposes consid-
ering its potential reframing in that externalist perspective that is the extended cog-
nition paradigm and evaluates its theoretical implications. He also discusses an 
account of ignorance that, albeit popular outside of academia, has been implied but 
not explicitly acknowledged in scholars’ efforts: ignorance in a normative frame-
work that sees the lack of knowledge, or ignorance, as the result of an epistemic 
failing of the cognitive agent. Acknowledging the popularity in philosophical 
debates of the concept of propositional ignorance and its specification in negative 
normative light, he wonders whether and how these concepts would affect the the-
ory of extended cognition. This framework, in turn, is also taken in its best possible 
version since Pritchard wants to see how these ignorance-based concepts work if we 
assume that “extended cognition is not only possible but also that it is increasingly 
widespread as technology becomes ever more seamlessly integrated into our lives.” 
Thus, the chapter tries out and dives deep into the possibility of applying the ideas 
of propositional ignorance and its normative version in the extended cognition para-
digm, asking: “does the growth in extended cognition lead to new ways in which we 
might be ignorant, or at least suggest that we are likely to be more ignorant than 
before?”
Discussing these concepts’ applicability in this framework shows their limita-
tions and strange implications. Analyzing both states of ignorance as either result-
ing from a sound or faulty extended reasoning, Pritchard eventually indicates the 
lack of concluding evidence for a newly discovered version of propositional 
S. Arfini and L. Magnani

ignorance that extends in our environment. Extended cognition may lead to igno-
rance only when a normative account is applied and the agent has adopted a flawed 
cognitive process to obtain information. This limited option shows how the extended 
cognition paradigm unquestioned in its assumptions, and the propositional accounts 
of ignorance, seem incompatible. This limit, if explored, could lead to an opening 
of discussions regarding the theoretical applications of both frameworks. As 
Pritchard concludes:
Of course, we have not considered all the myriad ways that extended cognitive processes 
might lead to ignorance, but the upshot of the foregoing is to make at least a prima face case 
for thinking that whether the widespread use of extended cognitive processes leads to the 
proliferation of ignorance turns on some quite specific details about how these processes are 
employed (e.g., where they have a tendency to make us overconfident in our judgements, 
and hence prone to error).
1.2.4  Mindshaping, Racist Habits, and White Ignorance: How 
We Think and How We Could Change
Michelle Maiese instead finds almost perfect compatibility in the interaction 
between the enactive cognition paradigm and the idea of “white ignorance” 
described and defended by Mills (2007) in the epistemology of ignorance discus-
sions. He defined white ignorance as a cognitive tendency differently spread in the 
white population that distorts how white people see the world they live in, willingly 
or tacitly reinforcing racism and white supremacy. These social influences are sub-
tle but can be addressed and overcome. Thus, white ignorance remains a pernicious 
threat to the development of an equal society as long as it is not understood, 
acknowledged, and overtly challenged. To allow the uncovering and confrontation 
of the perils of white ignorance, Maiese adopts enactivist theories that well explain 
its generation and constant diffusion and how it can be unmasked and faced. She 
describes how white ignorance develops through social influences that affect peo-
ple’s sense-making processes and create and maintain certain habits. This way, she 
argues: “insights from the enactivist approach can help us to understand the inter-
play between social-structural factors and individual factors in the production of 
white ignorance.”
Indeed, one of the most interesting and convincing features of this approach to 
the issue of white ignorance is that it does not rely solely on the explanation of indi-
vidual choices or on the understanding of the socio-structural factors that the con-
text imposes on the agents. Since sense-making is constructed by the constant 
interaction of the agents in their environment, change is attainable only by focusing 
on the interaction and by affecting both individual perspectives and motivations and 
demanding social and political actions.
White ignorance is not described as uncurable but is persistent because the habits 
of mind that we learn and integrate into our day-to-day life emerged because they 
were practical and stay until they are directly challenged and disadvantageous. 
1  Introduction: Externalist Perspectives on Ignorance and Cognition

8
Moreover, even when some forms of white ignorance are uncovered and condemned 
(Maiese takes as a case study the Dutch tradition of Black Pete), changing them 
seems complicated. This depends on the fact that people’s habits of minds not only 
allow discriminatory or offensive practices and behaviors, but they also provide 
justifications that appear not related to individual choice but to social aims and ben-
efits (e.g., many people underline the importance of traditions for children to justify 
the need for Black Pete). The necessity of individually avoiding the accusation of 
racism by appealing to societal aims then becomes what reinforces these social 
influences and what allows the permanence of white ignorance in our social envi-
ronments. What Maiese’s enactivist perspective on ignorance asks for is both indi-
vidual and societal awareness and change: if one is achieved, the other will 
hopefully follow.
1.2.5  Ignorance and (Im)Possibility: Between 
Close-­Mindedness and Wonder
In the sixth chapter of this book, Vlad P. Glăveanu also discusses ignorance that 
affects people’s perspectives and social responses. His discussions take shape within 
the emerging socio-cultural theory of the possible, which concerns the circum-
stances in which possibilities embedded in specific socio-cultural frameworks 
emerge as attainable to agents. In this regard, ignorance allows us to consider how 
lack of knowledge limits or fosters the perception and cultivation of new possibili-
ties in different contexts. In particular, Glăveanu considers four types of ignorance 
that may affect people’s perceptions of new options: default, masked, deliberate, 
and wondrous ignorance. He briefly describes these conditions as such:
default ignorance or the state of not being aware, on a daily basis, of perspectives different 
than our own; deliberate igno- rance or the conscious decision not to engage with the per-
spective of specific oth- ers; masked ignorance or the assumption of understanding a per-
spective one has no understanding of; and wondrous ignorance or a state of complete 
openness to new perspective without the assumption of final or certain knowledge.
To point out how these different types of ignorance make people interact with pos-
sibilities, he ties all his arguments to a specific case involving the perception of 
“others,” particularly migrants and refugees.
Masked, default, and deliberate ignorance well depict how people can reduce the 
possibilities they see and interact with by ignoring, devaluating, and hypocritically 
silencing others’ perspectives. In this respect, they further extend agnotological and 
epistemology of ignorance takes on how specific knowledge is not available to cer-
tain groups by discussing these cases as limiting experiences and social missed 
opportunities that have cognitive effects. Since they limit the distribution of knowl-
edge to the community, masked, default, and deliberate ignorance spread, people 
who limit possibilities for themselves also affect others’ chances to make different 
choices.
S. Arfini and L. Magnani

Fortunately, this cognitive effect also stands in the case of wondrous ignorance, 
in which the ignorance that lies in self-other relations is even a precondition of the 
opening of new possibilities. An aware acknowledgment of one’s ignorance of the 
other’s situation and experience is not an easy standpoint to maintain but, at the 
same time, continues opening new possibilities of relations. As in the case of cre-
ative ignorance (Ross, this volume), the epistemic tension that characterizes the 
connection between what the agent aims to know and knows about the other is not 
expected to reach a linear and definite conclusion. The ambiguity of ignorance in 
this context determines its cognitive value: when we treat others as a source of won-
der and possibilities, we are cultivating a good type of ignorance and advancing our 
chances to get new knowledge.
1.2.6  Mind Invasion Through Cognitive Integration: 
Accounting for Some Epistemic Drawbacks 
of Extended Cognition
Another self-other relationship defines the critical topic of the seventh chapter of 
this book, written by Giacomo Figà Talamanca and Elisabeth Hunting. The “other” 
in this relationship is not a human agent but a designed technology that acts as an 
intervening force in our online actions and interactions. Indeed, they consider 
Facebook as a paradigmatic example of a technology that, due to high cognitive 
integrability, is trusted by users and, thanks to this ignorance-based relationship, is 
used to perpetrate epistemic injustices. Interestingly, in this chapter, one of the cen-
tral notions of social epistemology, “trust,” becomes a keyword that both defines the 
means through which cognitive integration becomes possible in online environ-
ments and the main reason for which manipulative design works. Indeed, as the 
authors note:
The dimension of trust will be the most important one, for two reasons: firstly, in this case, 
it drives the integration the most; and secondly, there is an inherent ambiguity regarding 
trust in the context of digital platforms such as Facebook, since there is a difference between 
the trust in the artefact and the service provider. Specifically, we argue that trust in the plat-
form leads to ignoring, or not questioning, the intentions of the platform’s designer – i.e. the 
service provider and thus the design of the platform itself.
Cognitive integration, which the authors take from the extended mind framework as 
the use of artifacts as active components in agents’ cognitive processes, would not 
be possible if people would not trust the artifacts. This trusting relationship leads 
them to use the online environment and exploit its affordances so much that they 
cannot consciously see how this artifact is designed to promote their cognitive goals 
and achieve the purposes of the service provider. Indeed, the artifact is intended to 
make the users actively stay ignorant – cultivating trust as an unquestioning attitude, 
as defended by Nguyen (Nguyen, Forthcoming) – of the intentions and goals of the 
service provider.
1  Introduction: Externalist Perspectives on Ignorance and Cognition

Figà Talamanca and Hunting then explore an issue that is strangely understudied 
in extended cognition literature: they show how extended cognition, in particular 
cognitive integration, can provide epistemic benefits to the agent and make them 
vulnerable to manipulation and epistemic injustices. Users’ ignorance, in this con-
text, does not only result from a delegation of responsibility and knowledge to the 
service providers (as Copeland, this volume, describes) but is also encouraged by 
them since they have goals that at least in part diverge from the users’ ones.
That is also one of the reasons why the authors’ addition of “Institutionalization” – 
as “the use of the artifact is intelligible and functional only insofar as a community 
of agents uses it collectively” among Facebook’s dimensions of integrations in 
users’ cognitive systems – becomes essential. Indeed, it proposes to consider the 
fact that the same company can manipulate singular agents, and that is a distributed 
cognitive problem, which is a matter of concern for the public interest. The notion 
of institutions as collective devices that manage people’s ignorance is also consid-
ered and discussed in depth by Konrad Werner in the eighth chapter of this book.
1.2.7  Institutions as Cognitive Niches: Managing Ignorance 
in a Distributed Perspective
Why should we consider institutions as sophisticated cognitive niches? Konrad 
Werner focuses his chapter on this question and its importance for research areas 
concerned with cognitive theories, Ignorance Studies, and socio-ontological inves-
tigations of institutions. Starting from the importance of this description for 
Ignorance Studies, we need to highlight how Werner presents institutions as struc-
tures that manage the ignorance of the agents who dwell in them by offering and 
letting them access certain epistemic goods with a lower cost, in a way “masking the 
complexity of social interactions.” What the agents are ignorant about depends on 
what they focus their attention on and which goals they set for themselves. In this 
sense, he argues that institutions are sociological structures that allow people to 
achieve certain goals and those structures that give (as they propose and make avail-
able) specific goals for agents. Thus, this characterization of ignorance as a constitu-
tive element of institutions as cognitive niches profoundly affects their definition. In 
his words, Werner indeed defines them as such:
Institutions are (i) cognitive niches (or developments thereof), i.e., emergent products of 
structural coupling between agents and infrastructure, which includes – crucially – emer-
gent products of cognitive-behavioral limitations, thus emergent products of a certain igno-
rance (these products can be norms or patterns of behavior, as well as various combinations 
of them). These emergent products of ignorance (ii) are dedicated to “mask” the complexity 
of the structural coupling at stake. Alternatively – institutions are (i*) cognitive niches mak-
ing specific fragments of the world available as goods by decreasing cognitive access costs 
of getting them. The latter (ii*) is achieved thanks to placing the expected location of these 
goods as close to the agent as possible.
S. Arfini and L. Magnani

11
This description, in turn, has an impact on the accounts of institutions received from 
the relevant literature, since describing them from a cognitive and a biologically-­
informed point of view radically changes the idea that they function as rules (“the 
rules of the game of society or, more formally, the humanly devised constraints that 
establish a stable structure to human interaction” (North, 1990, 6)) or equilibria 
(“they generate regularities of behavior in the course of repeated games” (Hindriks 
& Guala, 2019, 3)). This new definition also changes how we approach ignorance in 
distributed cognition framework: discussing ignorance as a way to deflect the atten-
tion to certain things, problems, and situations means recognizing a productive con-
notation of ignorance as a catalysator of focus, which has also been investigated by 
Pinillos and one of us, Magnani, in the following chapter.
1.2.8  How Do We Think about the Unknown: The Implications 
of Persistent Ignorance in Abductive Cognition
As suggested in the subsection above, focus and attention matter also in the chapter 
written by Alger Sans Pinillos and one of us, Lorenzo Magnani. That chapter is 
concerned with how we can be self-aware of our ignorance, how we look for solu-
tions to the most resistant of problems, and what happens, even from an affective 
point of view, when a solution seems to be persistently out of our reach. The authors 
adopt an embodied perspective of cognition and an eco-cognitive approach to 
abduction, which allow them to describe abduction as hypothetical reasoning which 
is profoundly situated, since it emerges in the interaction between the conscious 
reasoning of the agents, instinctual and embodied clues, affordance perception, and 
the use of external resources.
Different authors have discussed ignorance in abductive theories, but not for an 
embodied and situated perspective: adopting that, the authors describe ignorance as 
not just what is left off from abductive reasoning, or what the agents are simply try-
ing to reduce, but as a persistent lack of certainty, which influences how reasoning 
is performed. So, to make a concrete case of abductive reasoning still in progress 
and profoundly situated, Pinillos and Magnani take the example of the Phaistos 
Disc, an artifact about which archeologists are still discussing and on which there 
are so little contextual data that it is almost impossible to describe what was used for 
and by whom. The only hypothetical information that archeologists are willing to 
take as a starting point of inquiry is the generic date of origin, the middle Minoan 
period, approximately 1400 BC. Above that, as the authors say, archeologists have 
started “a proliferation of hypotheses ad infinitum.”
The problem with this sensible approach to an unknown object is that it cannot 
even generate stable affordances: people perceive so many affordances that they are 
no help in establishing which action the object was actually for. As objective/subjec-
tive qualities related to action and generated from stable perceptual invariants of the 
object, affordances do not necessarily provide many means restricting the ways the

12
Disc was used. If we begin saying, “well, at least we know they were not using it as 
an umbrella,” we would still have too many hypotheses to consider or refuse on the 
ground of its dimensions and the material it is made of. And this overabundance of 
hypotheses is grounded on what we do not know of the object, and so it makes us 
feel anguish, which, as the authors describe, is connected to the “pressing need to 
find a solution” and may even force our hand in finding a working hypothesis lower-
ing our epistemic standards. In this case, as seen in other chapters in this volume 
(e.g., Ross’ and Glăveanu’s), remaining ignorant may be the most rational and pro-
ductive solution, which, interestingly, keeps also richly active our abductive 
cognition.
1.2.9  How Do We Become Ignorant? From Ignorance 
as a Result to Ignorance as a Process
In the last chapter of the book, one of us, Selene Arfini, deals with the consideration 
of ignorance as not only a state but as the ground of processes through which people 
can become ignorant – looking at knowledge and ignorance as not static nor ever-
lasting means to recognize their nuances in the changing processes. As we assume 
that when people are learning something, they cannot fully know what they are 
learning – so we admit that they are also still in ignorant states – at the same time, 
when they realize they are ignorant of something, or when they unlearn or forget 
something that they used to know, we are admitting that there is a mixing of knowl-
edge and ignorance in their states and processes.
These nuances become interesting from a cognitive point of view because they 
give reasons to explain how people act and react when they are ignorant of some-
thing, but they also reveal the complexities of embodied, extended, and distributed 
cognitive processes. According to Arfini, these processes not only support produc-
tive and enriching knowledge-building reasoning, but they are also involved in those 
processes that allow people to believe in false statements, unlearn useful skills, and 
become confident in knowing something when it is not the case. If we endorse 
externalist perspectives and assume that our cognition is embodied, extended, situ-
ated, or distributed, we also need to see both our failings and our epistemic limita-
tions as a significant part of this externalist viewpoint.
To discuss concretely “to-ignorance” processes (which she describes as ways in 
which agents end up being consciously or unconsciously ignorant), she takes as an 
example how people can connect with and trust fake news on online platforms. 
Taking an embodied perspective on these cognitive acts, she discusses how some 
objects found online can afford agents to perform epistemic actions (which are 
actions that aim to affect the epistemic state of the agents) as well as pragmatic ones. 
Both the epistemic and pragmatic actions have different effects on the cognitive 
conditions of the individuals as they make them curious or doubtful about some-
thing they realize they do not know or reinforce their confidence in what they think

they know about. These affordance-based suggested actions need to be accounted 
for in the externalist perspective on cognition because they help us see the interac-
tion between knowledge and ignorance in our extended cognitive systems. In turn, 
this lets us plan for new kinds of adjustments to make ignorance productive and 
knowledge more widespread.

Relational Ignorance
Samantha Copeland
Abstract  This chapter explores ignorance that relates to our ability to fully under-
stand our own role in an epistemic community, specifically in relation to the roles of 
others. It is an explicitly social approach to ignorance, to the ignorance that shapes 
our relationships with others, and constrains our ability to know, requiring us to 
trust. This ignorance is embodied within our relations with one another as epistemic 
agents; it exists in the space between. Focussing in particular on the ways we regu-
larly extend our cognition by depending on others (or on our tools) to perform steps 
in our cognitive labour on our behalf, I use an account from relational autonomy 
theory in feminist bioethics to examine the importance of reliability and its comple-
ments, trust and self-trust in these relationships. Further, I look to how such rela-
tionships can either  cultivate or hinder our epistemic agency and the agency of 
others, particularly in contexts where there is potential for oppression or collabora-
tion, exploitation or intimacy.

2.1  Introduction
One of the key insights in recent work in Ignorance Studies has been the move away 
from seeing ignorance as a solely negatively evaluated state, toward understanding 
its sometimes even essential role in our cognitive and social epistemic processes and 
procedures (e.g. Arfini, 2019; El Kassar, 2018; Firestein, 2012; Gigerenzer & 
Garcia-Retamero, 2017; Hertwig & Engel, 2016; Townley, 2011). This chapter pro-
poses another step in that direction, by calling attention to the role of ignorance in

the kinds of epistemic relationships we find ourselves within, cultivate, or actively 
seek out, between each other and with the world. To that end, I propose a theoretical 
framework drawn from the concept of relational autonomy used in feminist episte-
mology and bioethics and explain how I think it applies in the case of ignorance. I 
then analyse several scenarios in succession to point to the relational aspects of the 
ignorance found within each of them, and to explain how attending to relationships 
allows us to unpack both the nature and the impact of ignorance in each case.
The relational model allows me to address a key issue that is raised by Ignorance 
Studies in various ways, the question of responsibility. Agnotological approaches 
have highlighted the role of intentional, constructed and directed ignorance, eluci-
dating the many ways that ignorance is used as a tool by hegemonic groups, to 
oppress others by denying or shaping their knowledge (e.g. Proctor & Schiebinger, 
2008). Feminist epistemology has shown how the privileged remain purposefully 
ignorant in the face of another’s knowledge, for example, through testimonial injus-
tice, by denying them the epistemic authority they deserve and need to be taken 
seriously (e.g. Fricker, 2007; Kidd et al., 2017; Dotson, 2011; see also Maiese, this 
volume). But the focus has often been on the negative impact that ignorance can 
have on agency: when we are made ignorant by others, our agency to act as knowers 
is diminished, while the constraints on our social and political roles gain 
strength when we are not taken seriously as having knowledge. Ignorance, however, 
is not always problematic; in this chapter, I focus on instrumental ignorance, such 
as we find in the above examples, but rather on examples of how remaining ignorant 
can play an everyday role in our lives and cognition, and can have positive as well 
as negative effects. What makes a difference, I will show, is whether allowing one-
self to remain ignorant depends on the unwilling contribution of cognitive and epis-
temic labour from another. The nature of the relationship, that is, matters.
When relationships are the focus, we must engage the embodied, interactive con-
text in which those relationships arise and unfold. This takes us into the realm of 4E 
approaches to cognition, and in this chapter, I will assume that the cognition to 
which I refer is extended, embodied, enacted and (at least partly) external.1 However, 
rather than explore the nature of the cognition happening in the following scenarios, 
I will focus on the interrelationship between the role of ignorance in cognition and 
the role of ignorance in the relationship that is formed, when we incorporate others 
into our cognitive tasks and lives. The scenarios depict several ways in which we 
create relationships through sharing cognitive responsibilities, intentionally, will-
ingly, or not, in our everyday lives. Through their analysis, I develop the notion of 
relational ignorance and explore its epistemological significance.
1 The scenarios I describe here focus particularly on the extended aspects of cognition. Although 
the relationships are between embodied individuals and the ignorance I speak of is enacted, these 
latter aspects admittedly remain implied rather than fully explored here. I leave that task to a forth-
coming paper, to allow better focus here. This notably also has the effect that in this chapter I focus 
on particular cognitive tasks that are also epistemic tasks, although this conflation, readers should 
note, does not always hold.

This idea of relational ignorance is derived from the use of relationality as an 
approach to autonomy within conditions of oppression. Relational autonomy was 
initially conceptualized in response to the problem posed by traditional, individual-
ized approaches to autonomy (see MacKenzie & Stoljar, 2000): that is autonomy 
was long assumed to mean the ability for an individual to make decisions about their 
own preferences and paths, without others’ interests or intentions superseding their 
own. In conditions of oppression, this seems an impossible ideal for the oppressed. 
For instance, can women make autonomous decisions, when their choices are con-
strained by what others think, such as is encountered by women worldwide who are 
prevented from going to school or told what not to wear, whose choices are con-
strained by gender ideals they do not share? If we keep to the ideal that autonomy is 
an expression of independence, it seems that such a constrained choice situation 
would prevent anyone from acting autonomously. Relational autonomy provides an 
alternative that avoids further disempowering the oppressed: Catriona MacKenzie 
and Natalie Stoljar (2000) regard it as an “umbrella term” for perspectives that, “are 
premised on a shared conviction, the conviction that persons are socially embedded 
and that agents’ identities are formed within the context of social relationships and 
shaped by a complex of intersecting social determinants, such as race, class, gender, 
and ethnicity” (p. 4). Rather than an ideal for each individual to attain completely 
on her own, relational autonomy can be thought of as an exercise of skills that are 
developed and enabled, as much as constrained, by the relationships we find our-
selves in. Some relationships are imposed, such as the relationships one might have 
with one’s oppressors, but others are crafted and enabling, even within situations of 
overall oppression and constraint. That is, one can act autonomously within con-
straints, in relation to one another and to the conditions one is acting within.
For my purposes here, I depend on the conceptualization of relationality 
expressed in a chapter from that anthology, written by Carolyn McLeod and Susan 
Sherwin, on the role of self-trust in the development of autonomy. Their focus in 
that chapter was on the autonomy needed for patients to make decisions about their 
own healthcare; here I will focus on the nature of relationality itself, and the role 
that relationships play in respect to self-trust:
On the first level, the self-trust is relational in a causal sense; supportive and social condi-
tions provide the materials for its development. On the second level, self-trust is relational 
in a constitutive sense; the agent’s trust in herself exists in part because others reinforce that 
trust in their relationships with her. (McLeod & Sherwin, 2000, p. 265)
Relationships, then, cause self-trust to develop, or prevent it from developing. 
Further, one needs to be in relationships to develop self-trust, because self-trust 
emerges from being trusted and from confirmation by others that one is trustworthy. 
If I do not experience relationships in which I am treated as someone capable of 
making decisions on my own, I will not learn to see myself as someone whose judg-
ment can be trusted. If my decisions are not trusted by others, I will not develop 
self-trust. To this I add the consideration that the kinds of relationships I am in

determine the nature of that self-trust and how I express my autonomy: because 
relations are what cause and constitute self-trust and, consequently, autonomy, they 
also determine what I trust myself to do or know, and how I will express my auton-
omy. In a patriarchal world, for instance, women might express their autonomy 
through constrained choices, carrying epistemic authority within the circles of 
action allowed. Their self-trust, and thus their autonomy, however, may be limited 
to within that context—they may not be trusted and therefore not have self-trust 
enough to act autonomously in other contexts. A tyrannical dowager from Downton 
Abbey, for instance, does not hold the same authority over the male politicians in 
Parliament as she does over the staff in her own household. Her autonomy, that is, 
is relational, in accordance with the relationships she has with others within the 
context in which she wishes to act.
Self-trust is thus shaped by relationships; the self-trust one has is what it is, 
because those relationships are what they are. If we have relationships with others 
in which our ability to trust our own abilities to make decisions, or to know things, 
is doubted and undermined, then we will lack the self-trust we need to act with 
autonomy or to express ourselves confidently as knowers. In this chapter, I will not 
focus on the development of self-trust toward autonomy, but rather on the role that 
self-trust and self-reflection (on our own abilities to trust well) play when we allow 
ourselves to remain ignorant. Remaining ignorant in these contexts that I will exam-
ine is a conscious or unconscious choice to place the burden of some of our cogni-
tive and epistemic labour on another, whether an object or tool or another person. In 
these kinds of relationships, ignorance can be maintained through trust: I trust that 
the “vehicle” I have chosen for my cognitive tasks will be reliable, and have self-­
trust in my ability to assess the reliability of the instrument I depend upon. However, 
as we will see, such self-trust may be misplaced, or the relationships themselves 
may perpetuate or generate harm by maintaining and allowing certain kinds of igno-
rance. I argue that it is by looking to the relationship itself that enables us to evaluate 
the nature and impact of the ignorance being thereby maintained.
2.2  Scenario One—My Trusty Calculator; Simple 
Extended Cognition
The simplest way in which we remain ignorant of things or how to do things, will-
ingly, is by trusting external devices to do that cognitive work for us, as I trust my 
calculator to provide the correct answer to complex equations that I could never do 
on my own with a pencil (let alone in my head). I do not have to acquire the skill of 
doing these equations, to the lament of conservative educators, because calculators 
are readily available. My own calculator has never let me down, so I rely upon it 
completely to do the cognitive work, to generate mathematical outcomes that I need 
to know every day. By extending my cognition in this way, I am simultaneously

19
allowing myself to remain ignorant about essential steps in a cognitive process, 
complex mathematics, that I need (sometimes) to do my job.
This kind of extended cognition was described in the famous 1998 Analysis 
paper by Andy Clark and David Chalmers, “The Extended Mind.” They argue in 
that paper that when we use a tool to complete a cognitive process, that tool deserves 
the “epistemic credit” of being considered part of that cognitive process. As they 
point out, if the math done by my calculator was done in my head, we would have 
no trouble saying that obtaining the outcome of that calculation was an important 
step in my own cognition (Clark & Chalmers, 1998, p. 8). Further, they point out 
that because that step plays a constitutive role in that process, the externalism here 
is an active externalism; the causal relevance of the external objects used for cogni-
tion means, according to this argument, that the object and one’s mind are coupled 
in a two-directional relationship. What I want to take from this paper by Clark and 
Chalmers (1998) is the understanding of the particular kind of instrumentality that 
such external objects can have for cognition—as the authors note, “reliable cou-
pling is required” (p. 11). It is the reliability of the object that allows us to integrate 
it into our very cognitive processes, just as our neural processes are naturally so 
integrated and reliable.
The relationship I have with my trusty calculator is notably purely instrumental, 
as with any other tool; whether the calculator works is a matter of mechanical func-
tion, and thus when it doesn’t work, it ought to be fixed. I would argue that whether 
or not it is an extension of my mind, I am thus in a one-directional “relationship” 
with it, insofar as it matters only to me (and not to the calculator) whether it per-
forms the role I expect it to. The reliability of the calculator is the only standard by 
which I can measure its effectiveness as a vehicle for my cognitive tasks, and so the 
only basis for its value to me and for the trusting “relationship” that I have had with 
it for the last twenty years or so of frequent use.
It is possible that cultivating such relationships with tools that allow me to learn 
fewer cognitive skills will result in my increasing inability to perform such tasks 
without the help of my tools. I may no longer be great at writing because I almost 
always type. I may have forgotten entirely how to perform the calculation for a tri-
angle’s hypotenuse, but I can remain ignorant of this formula so long as I have my 
trusty calculator and its numerous functional buttons to “know it’” on my behalf. 
The nature of my relationship with this tool—occasional use or complete depen-
dence, as a complement or a substitute for my cognitive skills—will determine the 
degree of my ignorance in respect to the cognitive skills I allow it to perform instead 
of myself. But the fact is that we use tools like this regularly, to differing degrees of 
reliance and with differing degrees of reliability.
Reliability in this case only very minimally relates to self-trust; I cannot really 
cultivate self-trust within these relationships, they do not confirm or give me a 
chance to practice my own abilities but rather supplement or complement them as 
they are. Further, while I may pass on the responsibility for knowing how to do 
trigonometry by relying on my calculator, I do not thereby pass on the responsibility 
for the decisions I make on that basis: trusting the calculator is my decision, and 
what matters is my ability to trust the right tools. The functioning of those tools is

the responsibility of manufacturers and distributors, attested to by the process I 
would go through if I wanted it fixed, asking for a refund or an exchange for a better 
working tool, for instance. Thus, while this kind of extended cognition gives us the 
basic idea of how we allow ourselves to be ignorant, for valid reasons, every day, it 
does not tell us much about relationality; for that, we need to look at relationships 
between epistemic agents—namely, people.
I look closely here at the relationship I have with my trusty calculator to point to 
features of that relationship, to illustrate how we can have a purely instrumental, and 
ultimately one-directional epistemic relationship that allows me to remain ignorant 
in particular ways. I may share a cognitive process with my calculator, but I use the 
calculator, in a clearly instrumental fashion, as a tool to “outsource” part of that 
cognitive process. The process itself is undertaken only for mine own purpose, and 
to mine own ends, with the calculator lacking agency altogether.2
2.3  Scenario Two—The Romantic “We”; Mutually 
Shared Cognition
At the other extreme from this kind of “relationship” I can have with useful tools is 
the fully bi-directional human relationship of co-dependence. In the words of Robert 
Nozick (1989), for example, mutual dependency is part of the nature of love, when 
one wants, “to form a we with that particular person, or perhaps wanting that par-
ticular person to be the right one for you to form a we with, and also wanting the 
other to feel the same way about you” (p.70). These two people who are now a we, 
as Nozick puts it, constitute a new entity through their bond, “created by a new web 
of relationships between them which makes them no longer so separate” (Nozick, 
1989, p. 70). One kind of new relationship between members of a couple is that of 
epistemic interdependency, as Nozick describes it:
…a certain kind of division of labor. A person in a we might find himself coming across 
something interesting to read yet leaving it for the other person, not because he himself 
would not be interested in it but because the other would be more interested, and one of 
them reading it is sufficient for it to be registered by the wider identity now shared, the we. 
If the couple breaks up, they then might notice themselves reading all those things directly; 
the other person no longer can do it for them. (1989, p.72, author’s emphasis)
This kind of willing and mutually acceptable division of epistemic labour of course 
would vary between couples—and within couples, over time—as to how the labour 
is distributed and what might be shared. But if we think of a couple who has had 
such an exchange ongoing for many years, we can imagine that this mutual sharing 
of daily cognitive labour becomes a staple of how they engage both each other and 
the world. Indeed, should the two remain together long enough to witness their own 
2 Bearing in mind that “smart” technological objects, as Hildebrandt (2015) has pointed out, can 
have a sort of agency. This is a point I raise again at the end of the chapter.

21
cognitive abilities decline with old age, they would be apt to fill in any gaps in 
knowledge or take steps in cognitive processes for each other where they can: one 
member of the couple may take on the task of remembering to take out the garbage, 
or they might both invest together in tools to help them, as a couple, remember 
things better overall (like a new alarm clock or smartphone).3 These two may see 
themselves as engaging in joint cognitive activities, filling in for each other where 
the other lacks skills or abilities, graciously and as an expression of their mutual 
fondness for each other as people and partners in the world. Indeed, Nozick sug-
gests that this kind of mutual compatibility is what grounds romantic love between 
autonomous individuals (1989, p.74).
The reliability in this scenario comes with experience: in getting to know one’s 
partner, one presumably learns about their strengths and weakness, and in living 
together over time, two people can learn to work together in ways that draw from 
the strengths of each.4 But the ability for each to depend on the other to fill in such 
gaps in cognitive skill and ability further arises out of the mutual trust that also 
grounds the relationship itself; it is an expression of love. They can allow them-
selves to be ignorant because they can trust the other to take up that cognitive labour, 
and only insofar as they can trust them to do that well. Misplaced trust, one pre-
sumes, would not result in a reinforcement of the bond: trusting a partner to do one’s 
accounting when that partner is terrible at maths is unlikely to result in a stronger 
couple bond over time. Reliability is established not only after repeated successes, 
as with the calculator, however, but rather derives from the overall trust one has in 
the other to be honest about their abilities (so as not to cause harm to oneself/their 
partner) and also, importantly, in self-trust, the confidence one has in one’s own 
understanding of one’s partner.
While in intimate relationships such as these, trust in each other through love and 
companionship will reinforce self-trust and trust in the other to take up cognitive 
tasks in an agreeable arrangement of shared cognition. The relationship itself allows 
for each individual to remain ignorant of some things, insofar as the couple as an 
entity, or we, ensures that there is less ignorance in their relationship overall.
3 I thank John Barresi for this excellent example, suggested by him during a colloquium presenta-
tion of the scenarios described in this paper at Dalhousie University Philosophy Department.
4 I take a two-person couple as my unit of analysis here, but presumably such sharing of cognitive 
labour could occur amongst more than two people, as can loving relationships. Because this raises 
an additional question, however, about collective knowing, which lies outside the scope of this 
chapter, I focus on the dyad here but without precluding the possibility of further generalization to 
non-monogamous relationships.
2  Relational Ignorance

2.4  Scenario Three—My Neighbour Sally; Socially Extended 
Cognition, Type I
Without an intimate and reliable relationship at its foundation, however, sharing 
cognitive tasks across individuals, thereby allowing oneself to remain ignorant of 
some things, can be more complicated than Nozick’s account of “love’s bond” sug-
gests. Let us consider a more casual relationship, with an acquaintance and a fairly 
explicit epistemic reason for its existence, such as the one I might have with my 
neighbour Sally, who works in the café on the corner. Because I see Sally every 
Friday, and because Sally is room-mates with our local yoga instructor, I have 
become reliant on them as the source of information about where in the park our 
yoga class will take place each Saturday.5 Indeed, I don’t even think about yoga or 
where it will happen until I see Sally on Fridays to get my morning coffee, and I 
don’t even have contact information besides Sally themself, to inquire from the 
instructor directly. I depend on Sally entirely, and their proven tendency to let me 
know what is up, when I go in on Fridays to get my coffee.
But what, in this case, is grounding the reliability of Sally? The nature of the 
relationship is not like the we of Nozick, but more like my relationship with my 
trusty calculator; and yet, it is different. Where the calculator has a particular func-
tionality that determines our relationship, I have generated a relationship with Sally 
because I assume they will continue to perform a function on my behalf. But that 
function is not what Sally is about, it is not their general purpose or function: out-
side of our encounter in the café on Friday mornings, they in fact have an entire life, 
other relationships, other duties and functions and concerns that drive their behav-
iour and attention and may have nothing to do with my need to know where yoga 
will be happening in the park this Saturday. So, while my reliance upon Sally may 
seem like my one-directional relationship with the calculator, it definitely is not.
Indeed, the reliability of Sally is not fully contained within or by Sally. They may 
have full intention to inform me, as usual, about the Saturday yoga class, when they 
see me Friday morning. But they may be sick that day, or stuck in traffic, or the 
power might go out and the café stand closed on Friday, or perhaps they missed 
chatting with their room-mate the night before, when they usually discuss the matter 
of Saturday yoga and what other events might occupy areas in the park that week-
end. These contingencies have nothing to do with the general function of Sally, and 
little to do with my assumptions about them as a timely and reliable source of yoga-­
related information; chances are, I have not considered these possible challenges to 
my ability to garner the information I need, when I need it.
Besides the possible interference of contingencies that affect Sally’s ability to 
tell me about yoga, the willingness of Sally to take on the responsibility for this 
cognitive task may be in question. Sally and I might go way back, and they may be 
5 This example is taken nearly directly from Selene Arfini’s, 2019 volume, Ignorant Cognition, 
chapter 3; indeed, the ideas in this chapter stem from reflections I originally had while writing a 
review of that book (Copeland, 2021), and are thereby directly inspired by Arfini’s work.

happy to play the role of go-between so that I can attend yoga with them every 
Saturday. They may be the kind of person who happily fills cognitive gaps for others 
in this way, or they may have reliable skills in this area, perhaps even working as a 
personal assistant a few days a week; if so, then their reliability from my perspective 
may be grounded in the relationship we have and the accompanying trust in each 
other to do what we have promised or to behave in such complementary ways, such 
as in the we described above. I may be consequently safe in allowing myself to 
remain ignorant about yoga, certain that Sally will come through and that I can 
depend on them, as a friend.
But insofar as Sally is my resource for yoga-related information, the fact that we 
are not in an intimate relationship, and they cannot be kept handy like my calculator, 
does make a difference. They reside somewhere in between being an extension of 
my mind and mutually sharing my cognitive load. It is the nature of the relationship 
itself that determines, again, the nature of my ignorance. In a friendship, it may be 
that I don’t just trust Sally, if I find them reliable, to have the information ready 
when I need it, but I also trust them to find a way to let me know that information, 
even if the power is out or their room-mate is away. A mere acquaintance, however, 
such as Sally who works in the café but whom I only know from those weekly meet-
ings, may feel no real responsibility for ensuring I know about yoga; if they aren’t 
at work when I come for my morning coffee, it’s possible they don’t think about me 
at all. In the latter case, the relationship is not what gives me grounds for relying on 
Sally and consequently allowing myself to be ignorant about yoga and the instruc-
tor’s contact information; in some such “relationships” that reliability is taken for 
granted, much like the reliability of the calculator, and in those cases we are not 
friends but I see Sally merely as an external vehicle for the cognitive tasks I am 
unwilling to learn or take responsibility for myself.
2.5  Scenario Four—Dependable Jo; Epistemic Exploitation
Instead of my neighbour Sally, we can then think of dependable Jo: a person I might 
rely on to answer questions about yoga whenever we encounter each other, and 
upon whom I rely to know all the important information about yoga that I need, so 
much so that I don’t bother thinking about it at all myself and remain willingly 
ignorant about my instructor’s contact information.
The nature of my relationship with either Sally or Jo causes my ignorance; 
because I can depend on them, I am allowed to remain ignorant about yoga-related 
information until they relay it to me, without my ability to attend yoga on Saturdays 
being affected (and thus, without having to “fix” them, because they are effectively 
performing their designated cognitive function).6 These relationships also constitute 
6 To relate this back to Arfini’s example in her 2019 book, this aspect is particularly important—
when the other person ceases to function effectively in this way as a vehicle for my cognition, I am 
forced to reconsider my own ignorance (pp. 72–73).
2  Relational Ignorance

24
my ignorance; the nature of the relationship I have with either Sally or Jo deter-
mines the extent of my ignorance, not only about yoga but also about Sally or Jo 
themselves. In the case of Sally my good mate, I may be ignorant of the particular 
contingencies that led to their absence from the café on Friday, but I know them as 
a person subject to such contingencies. In the case of dependable Jo, however, I may 
only know them insofar as they are the source of my information about yoga. The 
more I see Jo as merely dependable in relation to this information, the more I allow 
myself to remain ignorant about the rest of their life, or their nature as an individ-
ual person.
Indeed, the kind of relationship thereby determines the ability I have to remain 
comfortably ignorant. If my relationship with Jo is truly one-directional, then it is 
quite possible Jo has entered the relationship unwillingly and may even be annoyed 
by my reliance upon them to update me about yoga-related information every time 
we meet, and this may in turn affect their reliability as a source for that information. 
Jo may begin to avoid me to avoid having to look to their diary to perform the cogni-
tive task I have unilaterally assigned to them. They may even feel exploited, if I am 
also inclined to blame them for missing yoga last Saturday when they didn’t come 
through as I had assumed they would.
While the cognitive load on Jo may be light, asking them only to keep track of 
some yoga-related information, the burden in such relationships on those who take 
on the cognition of others who wish to remain comfortably ignorant can be great. 
Indeed, this kind of relationship arises because one person feels it is right or justifi-
able for the other to carry the responsibility for some of the cognitive tasks they 
ought to be responsible for themselves: Jo should not carry the burden of my want-
ing to attend yoga every Saturday, it is not their responsibility except insofar as I 
presume it should be and treat them thusly as a vehicle for my cognition, much like 
I treat my trusty calculator. But because Jo is a person, even when I perceive the 
relationship as purely epistemic and one-directional, it cannot be so: Jo has their 
own responsibilities to attend to, and their own cognitive load to carry, and so my 
assuming they will take on some of my labour is indeed exploitation if not willingly 
received.
My willingness and desire to remain ignorant can also be more or less a burden 
to others; being ignorant of my instructor’s contact information and the yoga sched-
ule may not affect the lives of others much, but if I allow myself to remain ignorant, 
for instance, of the privilege I have as an English-speaking white person from a 
developed country, it can have great impact on others.
Nora Berenstein (2016) coined the term “epistemic exploitation” to describe a 
particular way of shifting the responsibility for knowledge about the impact of rac-
ism and discrimination onto those who experience it, to their and our detriment:
Epistemic exploitation occurs when privileged persons compel marginalized persons to 
educate them about the nature of their oppression. I argue that epistemic exploitation is 
marked by unrecognized, uncompensated, emotionally taxing, coerced epistemic labor. The 
coercive and exploitative aspects of the phenomenon are exemplified by the unpaid nature 
of the educational labor and its associated opportunity costs, the double bind that marginal-
S. Copeland

25
ized persons must navigate when faced with the demand to educate, and the need for addi-
tional labor created by the default skepticism of the privileged. (Berenstein, 2016, p. 569)
Berenstein’s account clearly elucidates the role of labour in this exchange: having 
to think about, record, remember and transmit knowledge is indeed a kind of labour, 
labour that not only calculators but also people endure (2016, p. 570). I’d like to 
emphasize here that when we shift the responsibility for this labour, with the labour 
itself, onto others, we shift it off of ourselves. Allowing ourselves to remain igno-
rant in these cases is equivalent to absolving ourselves of our epistemic responsibili-
ties by making others perform our labour. Further, the time and capacity that I 
thereby preserve for myself to use on some other desirable effort is taken away from 
the other, in terms of time and capacity they could otherwise devote to more worthy 
tasks. It is this kind of move that make some relationships exploitative, when I use 
others as vehicles for my cognitive tasks.
There are harms to myself as well as benefits, however, when I use others in this 
way. One famous explanation of the impact of allowing oneself to remain ignorant 
to too great an extent can be found in Hegel’s explication of the master and slave 
relationship (Hegel, 1977). In the early stages of self-certainty, the self of Hegel’s 
Spirit is like a Lord, admitting only of its own reality, with all others perceived only 
in relation to itself. That is, it doesn’t know what it is; only when it acknowledges 
the other as being like itself, and thus also a ‘self’, does the Lord gain self-­awareness 
and Spirit progresses forward through History toward Science.7 What all this means 
is that we can indeed perceive others purely instrumentally and only in relation to 
ourselves, as vehicles for our own cognition, but when we do this we learn nothing 
of our own ignorance, and we allow ourselves to remain ignorant in more ways than 
we can imagine (see Arfini, 2019 for an in-depth discussion of some of these impli-
cations of ignorance on our cognition).
This kind of issue has been captured particularly well by Charles Mills as ‘White 
Ignorance’ (for further discussion of this kind of ignorance see Maiese, this vol-
ume). As Mills (2007) argues in his essay of that name, whites fail to account for 
blacks as significant labourers in their epistemological economy, as sources of 
knowledge that allow them to be ignorant about important things. As a result, simi-
larly to the problem of dependable Jo above who is not seen as a person but reduced 
to the knowledge she has to offer, “What people of color quickly come to see—in a 
sense, the primary epistemic principle of the racialized social epistemology of 
7 Neo-Hegelian approaches to subjectivity have highlighted this interdependence by focusing on 
the importance of recognition to subjectivity (i.e. Charles Taylor, Axel Honneth, Judith Butler, 
Nancy Fraser). As Kelly Oliver (2015) has pointed out, however, relying on recognition in this way 
tends to perpetuate relationships of dominance and oppression, insofar as those who are oppressed 
must rely on their oppressors to recognize them, in order to have subjectivity. This is also an issue 
for relational autonomy and self-trust, the reader may note: if I must rely on my oppressors to 
enable me, within relationships, to enact my self-trust in order to develop my autonomy skills, it 
seems that conforming rather than acting autonomously will be rewarded and therefore ground my 
self-trust. I tackle this issue in a later section, in relation to the problem of epistemic “echo cham-
bers,” and the issue of recognition in the concluding section.
2  Relational Ignorance

26
which they are the object—is that they are not seen at all” (Mills, 2007, p. 18). Most 
important for Mills, however, is the kind of white ignorance that exists whether or 
not whites mean to remain ignorant; they may not know important facts about their 
own history or race relations, “because of the social suppression of the pertinent 
knowledge, though without prejudice [themselves]” (Mills, 2007, p. 21).
Ignorance such as white ignorance can amount to exploitation when there is a 
moral failure in remaining ignorant, when the relationship is built on seeing the 
other’s labour as available to one, without reciprocation or agreement. The relation-
ships between those in a racial hierarchy, where white knowledge is seen as the 
general exemplar by which knowers ought to be evaluated, shape the ignorance that 
white people are allowed to have. The more privileged one’s experience, the more 
likely one will stay a Lord, unwittingly ignorant about one’s own ignorance.
The social group is not only a source of epistemic oppression, however—we 
generate knowledge in communities, and can aid each other to recognize our own 
ignorance. Again, it is the relationships we maintain between each other that allow 
us to do this; I now turn to the nature of epistemic communities, as seen through the 
lens of relational autonomy.
2.6  Scenario Five (Application 1)—The Social Media 
Hivemind; Socially Extended Cognition, Type II
One example of a non-exploitative social relationship wherein others do indeed 
perform cognitive labour on my behalf are communities in which knowledge shar-
ing is a common practice. For instance, it is common on platforms like Facebook or 
Twitter to see requests for information sent out to the general public through some-
one’s followers; I particularly appreciate the conception of these potentially-­
epistemic communities as a social media “hivemind.”8 The idea is that by asking a 
diverse and multitudinous group of people, one might get the best answer to one’s 
question. In a sense this is exploitative, and can be if the relationship between 
inquirer and hivemind remains one-directional and unwilling from the side of those 
providing the information. A case of such exploitation might be plagiarism, where 
one posts without the intention of my taking it and using it to my own purposes, and 
systems of copyright and citation exist to mediate those relationships and prevent 
such exploitation. Further, when the inquirer is also a participant, providing infor-
mation when they have it in response to others’ inquiries, and this is the general 
expectation of participants in that community, then the exchange can be seen as an 
example of shared cognition, like a collective we, instead. Or one might simply 
share what one knows with others, such as in an online ‘ask anything’ session on 
8 I traced my own familiarity with this term to Shannon Dea, whom I thank for this link to the rel-
evant Reddit thread, tracking its likely origins: https://www.reddit.com/r/etymology/

Reddit; but these are voluntary actions, and may even benefit the volunteer with 
recognition and opportunities for sharing ideas, so are not exploitative.
We can, that is, be instrumental to each other’s ignorance and knowledge in both 
good and bad ways. Here again we see that the relationships we are in can be both 
causal and constitutive of our ignorance. Cynthia Townley’s account, for instance, 
calls explicit attention to the role of ignorance in building and maintaining epis-
temic communities, in which we can grow as knowers. I draw here from Chapter 2 
of the book, A Defense of Ignorance (Townley, 2011). Epistemic communities are 
more than a set of relationships in which people exchange knowledge with each 
other, those relationships also constitute the space in which individuals develop as 
epistemic agents, where they learn epistemological skills, and where they might 
gain self-trust as knowers. That is, the relationships between people in a community 
are the means by which epistemic self-trust can be developed; epistemic agency, an 
expression of the autonomy one has when one is taken seriously as someone who 
knows, can consequently also be thought of in relational terms. Part of good prac-
tice as a member of such a community is to be self-reflective about one’s own igno-
rance. I suggest in addition to these points made by Townley, that critically assessing 
the potential for bias when I assess my epistemic relationships is like critically 
assessing the ignorance I am allowing myself to have, by (possibly) taking advan-
tage of the cognitive and epistemic labour of others. As Townley points out, sharing 
this labour fairly amongst members of a community is tantamount to taking each 
other seriously as cognizers and knowers, and when this is done well, members of 
epistemic communities have opportunities through relationships with one another to 
develop self-trust and the skills of self-reflection.
So there is nothing inherently wrong about playing an instrumental role in anoth-
er’s ignorance, performing cognitive labour for others so that they may remain igno-
rant. The unit of analysis is the relationship between them, if we want to understand 
the nature and scope (and implications) of the ignorance. Harmful relational igno-
rance causes harm to people by way of maintaining ignorance through relationships 
that dominate, discriminate, oppress or otherwise constrain the other member of 
that relationship from being taken seriously as an epistemic agent or developing 
self-trust as an epistemic agent, while exploiting them as a source of information 
and a vehicle for cognition. When ignorance about myself or my own history is 
maintained along with ignorance about my own privileges in a society and about the 
consequent discrimination of others so that I can keep those privileges, then I am 
responsible for cultivating relationships that maintain that ignorance. In all cases, I 
should be responsible for the relationships I cultivate in order to remain ignorant, 
whether it is when I trust experts or my good mate Sally, but in the case of harmful 
relational ignorance, I am thus also culpable for the harm and the ignorance that 
such relationships cause and constitute. What relational ignorance highlights in this 
context is that the ignorance is situated in a larger context of sometimes complex 
relationships (see also Tuana, 2006, for the situational nature of ignorance).
Relationships that cultivate self-trust and autonomy, that is, and that provide 
opportunities to practice the epistemological skills of critical engagement with 
information and each other, will still allow for the division and sharing of cognitive

labour but without exploitation or harm (see Marin & Copeland, forthcoming). The 
trouble with ignorance, however, is that it is tenacious and tends to hide (see Arfini, 
2019)—that is, we will often find we fail to recognize our own ignorance, or how 
we use others to maintain it. For this reason, in an ideal epistemic relationship, we 
would be able to rely on each other to not only perform the cognitive labour of the 
everyday, but also and importantly, to critically engage the ignorance that we allow 
ourselves to thereby maintain.
We are responsible for these relationships and the harm they may cause because 
the burden of this additional epistemic labour should be always on the one who 
would remain ignorant by allowing, asking or coercing others to perform such 
labour on their behalf. For example, Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein (2020) 
offer a perspective on sharing the burden of data collection and analysis, pointing to 
this work as another form of epistemic labour often left to the ones who are not vis-
ible, for reasons such as those pointed to above and raised by Mills. For instance, in 
a narrative about the role that young adults in Detroit played in making authorities 
aware of the high numbers of traffic deaths among blacks that are caused by whites 
in that city, Ignazio and Klein (2020) remark:
Those dominant groups and institutions were the ones that, by privileging their own social, 
political, and economic interests, bore much of the responsibility for the problem; and they 
also, because of the phenomenon we have described as a privilege hazard, were unlikely to 
see that such problem existed in the first place. (p. 57)
The idea of a privilege hazard in their book, Data Feminism, is as an ignorance 
problem: people with privilege will often remain ignorant of the fact there are things 
out there important to other groups that they don’t know about, and their data col-
lection and analysis practices are both caused by and maintain this ignorance. To see 
how this kind of relational ignorance can affect both those who know and those who 
would remain ignorant, I turn now to look at a scenario where self-trust is misplaced 
and misguided within an epistemic community.
2.7  Scenario Six (Application 2)—The Echo Chamber; 
Misplaced (Self-)Trust
When relationships fail to cultivate good skills and self-trust, or if they cultivate 
self-trust in the wrong way (leading, say, to over-confidence), then we find again it 
is the relationships that cause and constitute the ignorance that results. While there 
are questions about how common a true “echo chamber” can be, it plays a role as an 
extreme possibility of this scenario: A network in which authorities constrain its 
members from critically engaging the information they receive, by coercion or by 
training them in “critical thinking” skills that lead them in the wrong epistemic 
direction. In a world of “fake news” and conspiracy theories, contemporary culture 
takes this fear rather seriously, and we see its effects when pandemics fill hospitals 
with people refusing to be vaccinated because they have been misinformed.
S. Copeland

29
In this case, we do not seem to have a situation the same as above, where will-
ingly or unwillingly some members of a community are taking on the burden for 
others, in a division of cognitive labour, whether fair or unfair. In these situations, 
bubbles and chambers as they have been called, the relationships still make up the 
space where epistemic agency is developed and cognitive, critical skills are learned. 
But the focus of these concepts is on the overall effect of the group interacting with 
the context (e.g. social media) where information is shared. The practices of sharing 
online both create new relationships as well as build on relationships we have with 
each other “in real life” (Talamanca & Arfini, forthcoming). So here, the sharing is 
indeed mutual, but the relationships built via and upon that activity generate and 
maintain relational ignorance as well. With this scenario, therefore, I attend to the 
ignorance of the individual who finds themselves within such a bubble or chamber, 
and how those online relationships of sharing can cause and constitute that 
ignorance.
In other work (Marin & Copeland, forthcoming), Lavinia Marin and I have 
focused on the relationship between self-trust, critical thinking and autonomy. 
Again following McLeod and Sherwin (2000), we take self-trust as relational in 
respect to autonomy—that is, the kind of self-trust we need for autonomy, in 
decision-­making and when we share our knowledge through testimony that needs to 
be taken seriously, is relational. Similarly, when we make decisions about what we 
can allow ourselves to remain ignorant about, we are expressing our level of trust in 
those who would carry that responsibility if needed, instead of us. We are also 
expressing our level of self-trust, in our own ability to make such judgements about 
whom to trust.
I wish to add here the consideration that, because one can have self-trust and can 
believe that one is making accurate judgments about whom to trust, and yet be 
wrong about that—as the possibility of an echo chamber suggests, and as has 
haunted debates about evil daemons through the history of philosophy—it cannot 
be only self-trust but also reflexivity that is required for individuals to be able to 
assess their own ignorance. Relational ignorance gives a way into this problem. Its 
conceptualization suggests that we can unpack the nature, scope and impact of our 
ignorance by turning first to understand what kinds of epistemic relationships we 
are in. Am I treating my other community members as I would Sally or Jo? How are 
they regarding me?
In relation to critical thinking online, Marin and I (forthcoming) suggested that 
critical engagement is a criterion by which we can normatively evaluate online com-
munities. Engagement implies an equal sharing of the burden of critical thinking 
about information, as well as the mutual development of cognitive and critical skills. 
In echo chambers, only certain people or groups are allowed to take up the burden 
of knowing the truth about something; only some people are to be trusted (Nguyen, 
2020, p. 146). With its border guarded by this distrust of outsiders, inside the echo 
chamber self-trust can only be developed through conformity to the rules of that 
community: when one trusts the right others, then one can trust (and be trusted) 
oneself. Refusing to engage certain others, then, defines the relationships one is in, 
2  Relational Ignorance

30
and those relationships in turn (and the rules of dis/engagement they enforce) shape 
the nature of one’s ignorance.
To return to the idea that relational ignorance is about sharing the cognitive bur-
den and allowing ourselves to remain ignorant, this can now be applied more clearly 
to this scenario as well. That is, in echo chambers, it seems that the burden is indeed 
taken on by someone willingly, the authorities who determine which others cannot 
be trusted and what information counts as true. Others who willingly participate in 
such chambers as receivers and disseminators of information sometimes even 
remain intentionally ignorant of the reasons behind those decisions, such as the fol-
lowers of the alleged “QAnon,” a shadowy figure who apparently posted cryptic 
messages for others to interpret, and whose interpreters became unquestionable 
authorities among followers online. Such ‘followers’ allow the interpreters, as 
authorities, to do similar work for them that I allowed dependable Jo to do for me, 
the epistemic labour of finding things out so that they can pass them on to me.
In an echo chamber, consequently, we see how the relationships there cause and 
constitute a different, and yet very similar, kind of ignorance that we saw in the 
scenario with dependable Jo. First, as noted above, the kind of responsibility and 
information involved can determine how great the burden itself is. But the way we 
treat each other both within and beyond our epistemic relationships determines how 
acceptable that burden is. And the relationships we have with each other shape our 
ability to trust the right people when it comes to allowing ourselves to remain igno-
rant in ways that their epistemic labour will compensate or complement. In order to 
create the right kinds of relationships for us to cultivate our own self-trust, we need 
to engage each other, not only through the mutual sharing of information but through 
the mutual sharing of that epistemic labour. Not allowing others to perform such 
labour is equally egregious as placing the burden of that labour entirely on some-
one else.
The “Lord” in Hegel’s dialectic may not be self-conscious, but their actions and 
assumptions affect others both directly and indirectly. We may not be aware of 
either our substantive or relational ignorance, but allowing ourselves to remain 
ignorant in some ways nonetheless has a direct or indirect impact on others and their 
own self-trust. But also, not taking responsibility for who we allow to take on that 
burden affects our own ability to act, to know, and to remain ignorant in ways that 
are conducive to our own autonomy and agency. As Mills points out, white igno-
rance not only limits the ability of those who experience white ignorance to recog-
nize their own role in maintaining the oppressive systems from which they obtain 
privileges, but also, and consequently, this limits their abilities in terms of moral 
cognition: they are unable to reason well about moral implications or make good 
moral judgments, because of their ignorance (Mills, 2007, p. 23). Relational igno-
rance, that is, can have fairly direct and potentially harmful implications for our 
cognitive capabilities.

2.8  Discussion and Concluding Comments
Consider that when a child trusts the authority of a parent or a teacher, they are also 
trusting those authority figures to make them aware of ignorance they have that 
should be resolved: a teacher does not only relay information, but does so in a 
timely and thoughtful manner that takes into consideration opportune moments for 
resolving ignorance, rather than just resolving ignorance per se (see also Townley, 
2011, chapter 2). When one takes on the role of teacher, in turn, one assumes certain 
epistemic responsibilities in respect to the ignorance of one’s students. The differ-
ence in the relationship a teacher has with a student, and the relationship that a child 
has with a stranger in the street of whom they have asked a question, can be described 
in terms of the nature of the ignorance that lies between them. The content of the 
ignorance that initiated the relationship may be the same in each case, but the rela-
tional ignorance will differ—this relational ignorance, caused and constituted by 
that relationship, has a direct effect on the burden that the epistemic labourer must 
bear. For the person on the street, as for my calculator, the burden is exactly the 
same as that content: assuming they willingly respond to the child’s inquiry, they 
take on only the responsibility for answering the question, if they can. It remains the 
child’s burden to find the answer if the stranger fails. However, the teacher takes on 
a greater burden in such a relationship, willingly, when they consider the question 
and the potential answer in light of other aspects of that child’s ignorance, and their 
own responsibility for resolving those. In such cases, the relationship is neither 
purely instrumental (as with the stranger in the street who might have the answer) 
nor is it intimate or fully mutual (like in Nozick’s we). Rather, the trust that the 
student can have in the teacher is given by the epistemic role responsibilities that the 
teacher takes on by playing that role—like with my good mate Sally, the student can 
count on the teacher to attend to their ignorance in ways beyond the simple exchange 
of information when convenient or required, because of the relationship they have 
with each other. The epistemically exploited person, however, who finds themselves 
unwilling and yet in a relationship in which they are presumed to be the natural 
bearer of the epistemic burden of another’s ignorance, finds themselves being held 
responsible for additional epistemic labour that the ignorant person refuses to or 
avoids taking up as their own responsibility. More than a responsibility for provid-
ing information, taken on willingly, exploitative relationships create role responsi-
bilities for people who belong to certain groups, to defend the knowledge of their 
own group and also to resist the ignorance of oppressing groups. These additional 
responsibilities emerge from the power dynamics and broader social aspects of the 
relationships that already exist between the people who would remain ignorant and 
those upon whom they would place that burden.
In the scenarios above, we see how the context in which relationships arise can 
determine how we treat each other as epistemic agents, and how or whether we ask 
others to bear the weight of our own ignorance. By attending to those relationships, 
rather than to the content alone, we can unpack how much ignorance is actually at 
play in these scenarios, its nature and its impact on both the cognition and the

agency of those involved. Importantly, this draws out the interactions between the 
social and the cognitive aspects of our epistemic worlds that together construct rela-
tional ignorance.
In the simplest case, the extended mind addresses our everyday use of objects as 
vehicles for our cognition. In the last scenario, another one-directional relationship 
was examined, wherein people who willingly reside in an echo chamber also absolve 
themselves of responsibility by depending on others to perform their cognitive and 
epistemic labour on their behalf. These two scenarios highlight the difference 
between treating others as though they are mere vehicles, such as I treated depend-
able Jo, or as individual epistemic agents who might willingly take on some of the 
cognitive burden so that I can remain ignorant about some things, as my good mate 
Sally or the ‘hivemind’ who responds to my online requests might do. Mutual shar-
ing does not have to require intimacy at the level of Nozick’s we to prevent the lack 
of self-awareness that marks the Lord and master in Hegel’s dialectic.
To further highlight the importance of relationality and self-trust in the instru-
mental relationships we have that maintain our ignorance in healthy or harmful 
ways, let us consider for a moment an ‘in-between’ case, that of smart technologies, 
which seem to have agency insofar as they use sensors to make decisions indepen-
dently to guide us in our behaviour. A heat sensor in my smart home with the aim to 
more efficiently use energy, for instance, may take into consideration the tempera-
ture of the home, my past preferences in setting temperatures, data about how other 
people heat their houses and the energy grid itself, and my energy saving goals in 
determining the optimal temperature at a particular time of day. Mireille Hildebrandt 
points out that the agency of such smart devices in making such decisions on our 
behalf requires us to revise our way of engaging with objects (Hildebrandt, 2015, 
particularly chapter 2). Because the machines have been programmed by humans 
but nevertheless perform those instructions independently and according to infor-
mation and calculations only the machines have access to, we must “reorganize our 
intuitions and realign our inclinations to develop a new kind of constructive distrust 
of what computing systems tell us and arrange for us” (Hildebrandt, 2015, p. 39). 
That is, our normal ways of assessing whether we can trust an object to function 
reliably so that we can relieve ourselves of the cognitive labour it will perform for 
us, do not work in the same way when that object itself has agency given to it by 
human-programmed algorithms, sensors, “big data” and independent learning 
mechanisms. We must reassess how to figure out when and whether to trust such 
smart devices, from within our relationships with them; this new context and new 
kind of relationship means that we need to develop self-trust anew within that rela-
tionship and for that context, in order to make autonomous and correct decisions 
about when and how to follow their guidance. What is novel about the smart tech-
nologies is that they create a unique relational ignorance. We need to get to know 
how those relationships work, how they cause and constitute our ignorance, before 
we can trust the objects enough to extend our cognition with them, and to trust our-
selves enough in those relationships to be able to tell when allowing those objects 
to perform our epistemic labour is appropriate.
S. Copeland

The same information exchanges, we have seen, might create relationships or 
take place within relationships that either enable or constrain an individual’s ability 
to act with autonomy despite being ignorant. That is, not all cases of ignorance limit 
our autonomy and agency; in many cases, we need tools and others to take up some 
of the epistemic labour needed for us to act in the world. I cannot know everything, 
and so I must trust others to know what I cannot, in the same way that I trust calcula-
tors and traffic lights to function correctly when I rely upon them. This classic prob-
lem of the division of cognitive labour can also be seen in terms of sharing ignorance. 
But when one’s trust is misplaced, or when harmful relationships lead to misplaced 
self-trust, then I am both limited in my ability to act independently as an epistemic 
agent in the world, as well as being unable to perceive my own ignorance for 
what it is.9
Further, we cannot understand the nature of relational ignorance without consid-
ering the full context of cognition; other people are not mere vehicles for my cogni-
tion, they are cognisors with their own conditions, needs and capacities, independent 
of what I need them to know for me. We must consider this broader context, because 
a focus on the mutual sharing of information gives us an insufficient account of 
whether a context such as an epistemic bubble produces harmful or beneficial cog-
nitive outcomes, insofar as we would be missing the important consideration of 
whether there is also a mutual sharing of epistemic labour and engagement. It is in 
those relational aspects that the difference between a ‘healthy’ epistemic bubble and 
an echo chamber that damages one’s cognitive abilities and epistemic agency, will 
lie. We cannot assume that the mutually shared cognition I depicted in the second 
scenario is a model for real-world epistemic communities: as Kelly Oliver (2015) 
has pointed out, such mutual recognition is an ideal but does not reflect the reality 
of how we relate to one another in the world. Rather, “recognition itself is an ongo-
ing process in which mutual recognition is never actualized” (Kelly, 2015, p. 477). 
Likewise, we must revisit our recognition of the others within the epistemic rela-
tionships we have in a continuous or iterative fashion, ensuring self-awareness 
about how much and what kind of ignorance those relationships allow us to have, 
and whether that relational ignorance is harmful or beneficial, and to whom. If we 
do not attend to our relational ignorance, we cannot hope to become less ignorant in 
many ways that are important to our capabilities in terms of self-trust, autonomy 
and epistemic agency, too.
Finally, using relational ignorance to conceptualize the ignorance that both 
causes and is created by relationships allows us to directly address the differences 
in power within those relationships, and its impact on our ignorance. The white 
ignorance and epistemic exploitation elucidated by Mills and Berenstein are two 
ways in which the power dynamics that generate and perpetuate ignorance can have 
a sweeping effect, not only on the self-trust and capacities of individuals, but also 
how society perpetuates systems of oppression. The fact that both harmful and 
9 Again, recall the example from Arfini’s book (p. 73): when I fail to perceive my own inadequacies 
as a judge of how ignorant I am, then I fail to exercise “investigative ignorance,” i.e. the kind of 
self-reflexivity needed for self-trust.

beneficial relationships may cultivate or maintain either harmful or beneficial rela-
tional ignorance means that we need to examine each case, not only in terms of what 
people are allowed to remain ignorant about, but also in terms of the broader context 
in which those relationships themselves develop.
By attending to relational ignorance, the ignorance that relationships produce, 
allow and maintain, we can get a better sense of the impact that allowing or coercing 
others to perform the cognitive labour we need, so that we might remain ignorant, 
can have: relational ignorance can both cause and is caused by these broader social-­
epistemological conditions. That is, relational ignorance lies at the intersection of 
the cognitive and the social, and thereby presents a point of coincidence worth fur-
ther study.

Creative Ignorance
Wendy Ross
Abstract  Much research in creativity proceeds from the hylomorphic model, that 
is the notion that the creator imposes a preconceived form on inert matter and a 
detailed plan is followed. In such a model, the unknowability of material engage-
ment is erased to the extent that the creative process is often reduced to the genesis 
of the creative plan, the spark of insight as it were. This model is being increasingly 
questioned and there is a steadily growing research literature demonstrating how 
engagement with an uncertain material and socially rich world shapes and forms 
cognitive processes and that rather than a linear and rational model, there is a deep 
knowing-through-doing at the heart of creative thinking. This chapter extends this 
literature in two complementary ways. First, I shall discuss how material objects in 
the world serve to scaffold our understanding precisely by revealing our underlying 
ignorance, an ignorance that cannot be revealed apart from through engagement 
with the world. This engagement leads to knowing and understanding which 
reverses the traditional direction of knowledge. I will suggest that this unknowing 
through doing marks both scientific and artistic creative thinking even if it is often 
erased in the former. Second, I will make the stronger claim that in the case of artis-
tic creativity, the ignorance which the process of material engagement inspires in 
the artist is both generative and necessary and, further, constitutes the heart of the 
creative act.

3.1  Introduction
Ignorance has an unusual status. The foundations of epistemological philosophy are 
concerned with what we know and how we come to know it so that what we do not 
know has only recently come under consideration. Even then, ignorance is viewed 
as a lack often resulting from epistemic laziness, something which should be fixed 
and resolved (Meylan, 2020). It is viewed as an inherently bad epistemic practice 
(El Kassar, 2018). This attitude reflects an adherence to the rational, fully cognisant 
individual as the pinnacle of philosophical ambition. Such a position, however, fails 
to take into account the very nature of being in a world populated with people and 
things, and in such a world, ignorance is not only essential but can support ongoing 
processes such as social interactions (see the idea of relational ignorance proposed 
by Copeland, Chap. 2, this volume). Under the latter description, ignorance can be 
seen as something which is desirable from the perspective of an embodied and situ-
ated thinker whose aim is not knowledge but rather an ongoing and harmonious 
interaction with people and things even if ignorance remains undesirable from the 
rationalist perspective.1 This chapter goes further and uses the phenomenon of 
human creativity as a way of illuminating how ignorance is not only necessary but 
lends value to human experience.
I make two key arguments over the course of the chapter. First, I will examine the 
nature of research in creative cognition: the investigation of the genesis of a new 
idea.2 I shall suggest that mainstream research should consider that creativity is a 
necessarily situated act which cannot be understood as a decontextualised or disem-
bodied event but rather is an ongoing process which unfolds over time and through 
a skilled co-ordination of many different embodied and material forms. I shall argue 
that, especially for moments of creativity, a model which posits cognition as an 
inherently socio-material practice is more suitable. This necessarily introduces 
uncertainty and ignorance into the process because of its reliance on the polyphony 
of shifting personal, material and cultural perspectives. The evidence from qualita-
tive psychological and ethnographic studies suggest that uncertainty and ignorance 
is an essential part of working with matter and while they are mitigated often by 
skill, these things can never be erased. Aligned to this is the idea that creativity as 
investigated in the laboratory is as much a reflection of this socio-material environ-
ment as more “real world” creativity. A key point will be made here that the link 
between certainty and confidence which characterises creative cognition in the lab-
oratory is not a necessary predicate of creative cognition but rather stems from the 
tools used to assess it.
Second, the generation of novelty cannot occur without an active embrace of 
uncertainty and ignorance. This is evidenced by the reports of creative people who 
actively seek to put themselves in a place of ignorance not because they wish to hide 
1 This is not the place to fully explore the situatedness of the rationalist perspective; for this, see 
Lakoff and Johnson (2010).

from uncomfortable knowledge but because uncomfortable ignorance supports cre-
ative understanding. In this domain, ignorance does not stem from epistemic lazi-
ness nor is it a helpful prop, rather is it one of the underlying aims of the creative 
process. Key to understanding this then is to reframe our assumptions – the aim of 
the creative process is not to uncover new knowledge, but rather creativity involves 
uncovering new ignorance and in the case of artistic creativity highlighting that 
ignorance. I will go further to suggest that it is this indeterminacy and engagement 
with risk in action that allows us to call something creative or not. Artwork requires 
risk and unknowing in process, and this often results in an ambiguous final form. 
This ambiguity is further enhanced by the ontologically indeterminate nature of the 
creative product which relies on multiple, temporally distributed perspectives to be 
called creative.
Finally, I will combine these two arguments to suggest that there is a form of 
ignorance that we can call creative ignorance, that is, an ignorance that emerges 
through interaction with the socio-material world, which is valuable to the process 
of creativity. I will call for the existence of this form of ignorance to add nuance to 
the idea of ignorance as being in the world rather than merely as a static epis-
temic state.
3.2  Creative Cognition from the Perspective 
of Experimental Psychology
Creativity is an interdisciplinary concern referring to a wide variety of cognitive and 
material practices. The argument presented here draws heavily from the psychologi-
cal literature on creativity. It further offers reflections drawn from the view of cre-
ativity as a situated and embodied phenomenon which can only be understood in 
practice. This is not a philosophical approach to understanding ignorance but a psy-
chological one. However, philosophy would do well to support its understanding 
with observations from the psychological perspective when considering human 
behaviour and actions.
Let us start with an explanation of the growing field of research on creativity in 
psychology. In line with the internalist attitude that undergirds most of those disci-
plines which seek to understand human behaviour, much psychological research on 
creativity aims to isolate a creative spark; this spark is both momentary and nor-
mally considered as something which can be found inside the head of the creative 
thinker. In other words, this research programme takes as its focus what is in the 
head prior to any material realisation. Psychologists then are interested in which 
cognitive or psychometric properties of a person have the potential to be creative 
(although they do so without assessing the realisation of that potential). The under-
lying cognitive processes take three main forms3: divergent thinking (that is 
3 For a clear introduction to the different approaches to creative cognition, see Abraham (2019).

­generating many ideas), convergent thinking (that is selecting ideas which go 
together) and moments of creative insight (when an idea strikes with sudden force).4
The moment of creative insight is most often associated with folk notions of 
creativity, especially creative genius. Consider the image of a person struck by a 
clear thought and sudden access to knowledge as described by Graham Wallas 
(1926, 46) as “instantaneous and unexpected….this instantaneous flash.” Creative 
insight is commonly described as the spark which precedes and, crucially, deter-
mines the creative act. So much so that the manifestation, the act of creating, is 
rarely considered as part of the psychological process (Glăveanu & Beghetto, 
2020).5 It has a very clear link to knowledge, because it is associated with the gen-
eration of, at the least, a novel perspective on a problem and at best new knowledge 
itself. However, there is very little focus on the development and transformation of 
ideas in part, because the idea is considered complete once it has been mentally 
conjured. This reflects an underlying internalism which ignores evidence from pro-
cess monitoring and other empirical research. Rather, I argue that the idea is simply 
the start of the creative process. It is for this reason that these tasks should be con-
sidered as a measure of creative potential rather than creativity per se. Of course, the 
initial idea is necessary for creativity, but I argue it is not sufficient.
In the standard definitions, this moment of creative “insight” is marked by an 
almost instantaneous access to knowledge and certainty. The lightbulb flash of 
insight stands in opposition to the darkness of ignorance. The moment of clarity is 
often referred to as the “aha” moment as a reflection of the gasp of unexpected 
understanding. The standard wording to describe an “aha” moment to experimental 
participants emphasises this clarity and certainty:
We would like to know whether you experienced a feeling of insight when you solved a 
magic trick. A feeling of insight is a kind of “Aha!” characterized by suddenness and obvi-
ousness. Like an enlightenment. You are relatively confident that your solution is correct 
without having to check it. In contrast, you experienced no Aha! if the solution occurs to 
you slowly and stepwise, and if you need to check it by watching the clip once more. As an 
example, imagine a light bulb that is switched on all at once in contrast to slowly dimming 
it up. We ask for your subjective rating whether it felt like an Aha! experience or not, there 
is no right or wrong answer. Just follow your intuition. (Bowden & Jung-Beeman, 2003; 
Danek et al., 2013)
Thus, it would seem that cognitive insight is diametrically opposed to ignorance. It 
relates to an illumination and a clear certainty that the course of action is correct. 
This gives rise to the idea of the “insight heuristic,” that is the theory that the feeling 
of insight is a reliable marker of the accuracy of a thought or an idea (Danek & 
Salvi, 2020). From this perspective, insight is the antithesis to ignorance, the light 
of “aha” chasing away the shadows.
4 Of course, these processes involve an overlap – often, an idea is generated with a feeling of insight 
and solving a problem will require generating several problem solutions.
5 Although it should be noted that Wallas was clear that verification was an essential part of the 
process of thinking.

Other approaches to cognition have sought to challenge this model, often by 
reference to “real world” creativity. Such a position is not neutral: it sets up a clear 
dichotomy between the “real world” and the unreal world of psychological science 
which deals in controlled and modularisable entities. The parameters and character-
istics of what constitute a real world are rarely explicitly delineated, it is simply 
enough that it is “other” to the experimental procedure. Thus, the real world can be 
the classroom, the artist’s atelier, the office…. anywhere other than the laboratory. 
It suffices merely that the “real world” displays complex and uncontrolled explana-
tory mechanisms. In contrast then, this position takes the view that work in the labo-
ratory is unhelpful, because it succeeds in creating a controlled environment so that 
the manipulated variables can be accorded causal status. In both externalist and 
internalist conceptions of experimental psychology, the laboratory is a clean space 
unsullied by the complexities of this “real world” (see, e.g., Vallée-Tourangeau & 
Vallée-Tourangeau, 2020 among others).
However, even in the psychologist’s laboratory, creativity takes place in a situ-
ated environment. This situation is a particular space characterised by a particular 
and unique set of socio-cultural norms and procedures and furnished with a particu-
lar set of properties which are rarely, if ever, acknowledged or examined by the 
problem-solvers or those who seek to understand their behaviour. When we leave 
these things out of our understanding of laboratory-based behaviour, I suggest that 
we are committing the “fallacy of the unsullied lab” and this fallacy constrains quite 
fundamentally our understanding of how creativity unfolds as a reflection not only 
of the processes of interest but of the surrounding cognitive ecology. Indeed, I sug-
gest that processes observed in the lab are often nothing more than a function of this 
highly artificial situation.
To understand this in more depth, let us take as an example a laboratory-based 
task often used to measure divergent thinking: The Alternative Uses Task. Here 
participants are given an everyday object such as a brick or a shoe and are asked to 
generate as many alternatives uses for it as they can in a limited amount of time. 
This is a measure of divergent thinking, a cognitive process which is commonly 
accepted to be necessary for creative thought. The suggested uses are not designed 
to be implemented – they are simply wild and crazy ideas with no material form. 
However, it is a generative act which takes place against constraints and which I will 
demonstrate reflects the interaction between the experimental situation, the task and 
the underlying cognitive processes.
First, words are formed which shape and constrain the thoughts and ideas which 
can be generated – uses which have no linguistic counterpart are not “counted” in 
the final creative output. However, novel uses are often embedded in action rather 
than in language. In spoken instances of the task, participants have been known to 
say, “I don’t know what you call it.” Gestures and movements are not registered as 
uses. There is a focus on linguistic uses which harks back to the understanding of 
ideas as carriers of semantic meaning. However, uses are embodied actions in the 
world much more so than disembodied linguistic concepts.
Second, this task is remarkably sensitive to changes in instructions and these 
affect the fluency and creativity of the answers generated (Acar et al., 2020). This

suggests that the research participant is engaging in a dialogue with the experi-
menter in which she is trying to play the game by the correct rules. Even if the 
experimenter is absent (the task takes place online for example), it is still a social 
situation and should be understood as such. The very act is situated, a play in an 
experimentalist’s laboratory which provides its own rules. This, then, in part struc-
tures the range of possibilities that are explored by the problem-solver. As Ormerod 
et al. (under review, p. 32) suggest in relation to an insight problem (Fig. 3.1):
There is nothing in the nine-dot6 problem statement to preclude ideas that involve chain-
saws, aliens, the paranormal, or other eclectic suggestions. Yet, when individuals seek solu-
tions, they limit attempts to those that appear germane to the problem.
In other words, no participant moves outside the set of normative parameters 
which is in part determined by the unwritten pragmatics of the experimental situa-
tion. These pragmatics are not part of the problem representation but rather reflect 
the wider socio-cultural situation. They are a learned behaviour. To borrow from 
Flynn (2018), behaviour in the psychologist’s lab requires a certain “habit of mind” 
which is not universal.
Third, the output is processual: One idea can spark another. Although ideas are 
often selected out of context for their absolute creativity to be assessed, they often 
come in a chain as one idea sparks another. There is a fundamental contingency to 
the nature of the initial spark of ideas – the first idea does not reflect a clear plan. We 
have demonstrated this in a related task where problem-solvers are asked to gener-
ate as many words as they can from a series of lettered tiles (Ross & Vallée-­
Tourangeau, 2021). Notably, when analysed from a process perspective, one word 
would generate another, and analysing a word as separate from the flow made little 
sense. So, the task demonstrates its own rhythm, and each word cannot be under-
stood without reference to the one preceding it, either because it flows naturally 
from it or because it is surprisingly and creatively different. So, rather than a single 
moment of creativity, we see a series of moments which cannot be understood in 
isolation. 
Beyond this, the very tasks are designed to elicit particular processes, so there is 
an unhelpful circularity. This is linked to the idea of “experimenter’s regress.” This 
notion was first introduced in Collins (1975) in which he argued that the 
6 The nine-dot problem presents participants with a 3 × 3 grid of dots and asks them to find a way 
to draw four straight lines without taking their pen off the paper in such a way that all the dots are 
cancelled. The problem requires the problem-solver to realise that they can stray beyond the imagi-
nary square in line 2.

enculturation of knowledge is important to scientific experimentation and that 
knowledge could not be transferred algorithmically. Fundamentally, the only way of 
knowing that someone had the skills to replicate an experiment would be for them 
to replicate the experiment successfully. This leads to regress: a tool functions as its 
own test. The example he gives in a later publication is designing an apparatus to 
locate gravitational waves to establish their existence:
What the correct outcome [to the question of the existence or not of gravitational waves] is 
depends upon whether there are gravity waves hitting the Earth in detectable fluxes. To find 
this out we must build ‘a good gravity wave detector and have a look.’ But we won’t know 
if we have built a good detector until we have tried it and obtained the correct outcome! But 
we don’t know what the correct outcome is until … and so on ad  infinitum. (Collins, 
1985, 84)
For Collins, the only way out of this is to find a way of fixing the apparatus outside 
of the experimental situation. This becomes more difficult when we are dealing with 
psychological traits that have no underlying physical substrate such as creativity 
and which can only be measured by the behaviours which they are also theorised to 
explain. Boag (2015, 3) describes this as “verbal magic” where entities are invented 
to describe behaviours which are then taken as evidence of the invented entity. 
Boag’s target is the research field of personality, but Sugarman (2017) makes a simi-
lar observation about psychology as a whole. He refers to this as “psychologism.” 
The basic process of psychology that he outlines is that a behaviour is observed, and 
this behaviour is assumed to have an internal motivation. An instrument is designed 
to measure that behaviour and in so doing reifies it. In all cases, there is experi-
menter’s regress, because there is no validation for the measuring instruments aside 
from the behaviour and there is no way of measuring the behaviour aside from the 
instruments. As Sugarman notes, this process is particularly difficult in psychology 
where the participants are active in their own study, so the instruments may create 
the phenomena they are measuring, trapping the researcher in a bottomless and 
unproductive regress.
So, however much research in creativity wishes to focus on the traits and states 
of the creative person, it will only go so far if it assumes that person is disembodied 
and situated in a vacuum and without examining the underlying assumptions it 
brings to bear on the task. Further, ideation cannot take shape without realisation 
even if that realisation is only in an internal monologue. All creativity has a form. 
The creativity that is measured in the psychologist’s laboratory is “laboratory cre-
ativity,” generated by tasks which have been carefully constructed to elicit the feel-
ings of confidence and certainty. It remains to be seen whether laboratory-induced 
insight is the same as insight that occurs outside the laboratory.
Consequently, this chapter argues instead that creative thinking is not a linear 
process which can be easily divided into a prior state of ignorance and a following 
clear state of knowledge pivoting on a moment of insight. Rather, creative work is 
marked by a form of skilled, creative ignorance which is not only actively embraced 
but also generated by creative action so that knowing and unknowing become inter-
mingled. This engagement with ignorance and ambiguity is part of what gives the 
creative work value. Ignorance, on this view, is a dynamic, processual state revealed

by and caused by interaction with things outside of the person who is being creative. 
I wish to draw attention to the sharp distinction between creative insight which 
refers to a discovered solution charted by laboratory processes and creative insight 
which is the start of a long, uncertain process. This state of creative not-knowing is 
closer to the uncertainty and discomfort described by creative people and is one 
which is left out of internalist models which are predicated on rationalist concep-
tions of knowledge. Overreliance on laboratory creativity without a recognition of 
its dependence on the situation has led creativity theorists to ignore the role of ‘not-­
knowing’ in materially engaged creativity.
3.3  Forms of Generative Ignorance
One noticeable distinction between creativity outside the psychologist’s laboratory 
and experimentally induced moments of creative insight is that the so-called insight 
problems used in experiments have a clear, normatively correct answer. Most of the 
time, this correct answer is also easily identifiable once it has been generated. Take 
the nine-dot problem described above – it is not possible to generate a false answer 
to the question with any confidence that it is correct. What this section advances is 
the idea that outside of the artificial constraints of the experimental psychologist’s 
laboratory, people do not have this same sense of certainty and foreknowledge about 
their work. Creativity outside of the laboratory does not have a single normative 
correct answer – the importance of certainty diminishes when the questions are 
being both asked and answered by the process itself. The reliance on data from 
experimental psychology to understand other forms of creativity has led to a link 
between clarity of ideas and creativity. Resituating these findings as ones which 
reflect the experimental situation as much as anything else weakens the link between 
creativity and certainty and invites us to start reflecting on the role of ignorance in 
the generation and, more importantly, in the verification and enactment of cre-
ative ideas.
While divergent and convergent thinking and moments of insight are cognitive 
processes that are worthy of study in their own right, they do not encompass the 
whole creative process and an excessive focus on them assumes that the ideas gener-
ated through these processes remain unchanged when they are actualised. By con-
sidering cognition as formed of discrete modules which can be logically isolated 
from environmental complexity, there is the not inconsiderable chance that cogni-
tive scientists risk committing the “mereological fallacy” (Bennett & Hacker, 2003). 
Mereology is the study of part/whole relations and this fallacy refers to the ascribing 
something to a part that is properly only ascribable to a whole. The underlying 
assumption of mereological composition is that the whole is the sum of its parts and 
nothing more and that through the process of composition or decomposition the 
parts remain the same. Rocca and Anjum (2020) compare it to building a model 
with Lego bricks: There is a logic to an analysis of the bricks as separate items in 
order to understand the whole model because the bricks remain unchanged 
W. Ross

45
throughout the process. In other words, the parts can be understood in isolation 
without reference to their place in the whole. This same logic underlies the isolation 
and examination of individual cognitive processes. If, however, the Lego bricks 
were malleable and changed during the building process, assessing them at the level 
of the brick would be meaningless because what would be of interest would be the 
shape and composition during building.
If we resituate the results from experimental psychology from the laboratory 
environment to one where there are no clear normative answers, then certainty and 
the illumination assumed to be wrought by insight become reflections not of creativ-
ity itself but the overall paradigm that judges insight as having these characteristics 
before investigating it. Creative cognition has the form it has because the research 
programme is seeking something of that form and reflects the tools which are used 
to elicit that. Even within this paradigm, enacting becomes important. The work 
from my laboratory (Ross & Vallée-Tourangeau, under review; Vallée-Tourangeau 
et al., 2020) demonstrates that “aha” increases once the answer is clearly seen to be 
correct so that the verification and illumination stage are collapsed. This points to a 
pressing need to move beyond the spark of an idea to examine how that certainty is 
generated.
The role of ignorance has been underplayed in the final product of the creative 
process because of this excessive focus on certainty and clarity. Once we abandon 
the notion that pure insight is more than an artefact of an experimental situation,7 
then the skills and the notions of what constitute creativity and what is important to 
the creative process start to radically shift. All creativity is supported by processes 
which cannot be easily reduced to a single spark of inspiration. Creating is an 
action-driven process that unfolds over space and time, shaped by a complex array 
of factors and forces, many originating outside the creator; creativity is not the prod-
uct of a stable set of features inherent to the creator (Glăveanu, 2020). We currently 
do not have a clear experimental research paradigm to assess creative cognition this 
way although work in systemic cognition is moving to assess the whole cognitive 
ecology in insight (see, e.g., Steffensen, 2017; Steffensen & Vallée-Tourangeau, 
2018; Kirsh, 2014). However, moving beyond experimental psychology there is 
increasing evidence from qualitative and ethnographic work that this relationship 
between internal and external forces is key to understanding creativity (Kimmel & 
Hristova, 2021; Malafouris, 2014; Ross & Groves, under review).
This section will demonstrate how a model based on certainty is inadequate pre-
cisely because it leaves ignorance out of the experience of creativity. I will consider 
this further and will make the case that dismissing ignorance frustrates our under-
standing of the creative experience. Indeed, ignorance and its embrace are often 
reflected upon as being a profound part of the artistic experience drawing on Keats’ 
idea of negative capability which he coined in a letter to a friend:
7 I would like to emphasise that this does not mean that such research should stop, but rather a self-
reflexive understanding of the nature of the situation is necessary for the findings of this research 
programme to be appropriately understood and its limitations explored.
3  Creative Ignorance

46
I mean Negative Capability, that is when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, 
Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.
This for Keats was the epitome of the Romantic’s call to centre the imagination over 
the Enlightenment focus on rationality. For Keats, great artistic creativity8 came not 
from the erasing of doubt and uncertainty but its embrace. The mark of a great artist 
is to not seek to resolve ignorance but to accept its ubiquity. The aim of the 
Enlightenment plan to literally “shed light” on the darkness of ignorance is mis-
guided not only because it will be unsuccessful (the “fallibilist argument”) but pre-
cisely because it is through ignorance that human life finds meaning. Keats uses the 
word “capability” here to make clear the importance of this skill: the skill of nego-
tiating and accepting our own ignorance. In sum, the relationship between igno-
rance and creativity may be closer than the flash of illumination commonly used to 
describe creativity make them seem. I turn now to address the two ways that igno-
rance and creativity interact: through ambiguity and material uncertainty.
3.3.1  The Importance of Ambiguity
The model of certainty which underlies approaches to creativity which are reliant on 
insight is accompanied by a model which assumes that the human agents have full 
control and move with intention. In other words, moves and processes which are 
associated with creative insight are considered to be intentional and this leads to 
them being endowed with post hoc meaning. Indeed, many researchers in creative 
cognition assess insight as being a preference or a choice (see, e.g., Salvi et al., 
2016). Moving beyond the laboratory, something creative has meaning and that 
meaning stems from the conscious, internal design of the creative person. Indeed, in 
the case of conceptual art, this “meaning” has become the artwork itself (March, 
2019). Thus, the meaning of the thing is fixed by the internal thought processes of 
the producer generated before the piece. This model collapses when the process is 
considered from a socially embedded and distributed perspective – the maker is no 
longer the sole arbiter of a creative piece’s meaning. The creator is at once erased 
and conjured into being with every viewing or reading. She becomes an actor and 
the object becomes an artefact (Glăveanu, 2013) – that is something which exists in 
dialogue with the surrounding socio-cultural environment. The audience is there-
fore involved in the generation of the final9 creative form. To borrow from Barthes, 
the relations between reader and author become such that the author and the author’s 
8 The focus of the majority of this chapter will be on the idea of artistic creativity. This is in part 
laziness on the part of the author, the evidence to support the argument is so clearly presented 
across empirical and theoretical literature that selecting it has been easy. However, the case can 
also be made that this form of ignorance, this embracing of not knowing, is a key part of any dis-
covery of new knowledge in the sciences as well as the discovery of novel forms in the arts.
9 Indeed, the use of the word final here is perhaps ill advised as it is not clear at what point a creative 
piece can be considered finished.

intentions are distanced and the death of the author is the birth of the reader. 
Importantly for the relationship between ignorance and creativity, it means that the 
meaning of the creative piece is constantly recreated in the space between the cre-
ator and the audience and is unstable; it is impossible to pin down a definitive mean-
ing of any piece and ambiguity is built into the very process of creativity.
This instability extends to the status of the piece as creative or not creative – the 
value attributed to something is done so by the audience, not the creator, and so that 
status is able to be revised. At first, this may seem like an argument about the judge-
ment of creativity rather than creativity in itself, but creativity and what is judged as 
creative cannot be disentangled. The standard definition of creativity is something 
which is “novel and useful” (Runco & Jaeger, 2012), but both novelty and useful-
ness are relational terms. Creativity does not reside in the object or the process but 
in the space between the artefact, the action and the audience. A process or object 
cannot be creative in itself, it must be granted that creativity by the surrounding 
audience. Thus, there is an essential and deep ambiguity at the heart of the creative 
process. In ethnographic work conducted with a woodturner who creates wooden 
bowls which are both novel and useful in form, we noted that the projected audience 
for the work was woven into every decision and yet was always unknowable (Ross 
& Groves, under review).
This relationship between the individual and the surrounding environment has 
been most succinctly explored in Csikszentmihalyi’s (1998, 2014) systems theory: 
“Therefore it follows that what we call creativity is a phenomenon that is con-
structed through an interaction between producer and audience.” (Csikszentmihalyi, 
2014, 314). This leads to a fundamental and unresolvable ambiguity at the heart of 
all creative things. The complexity of this relational aspect at the very heart of cre-
ativity can provoke profound anxiety in commentators who wish to pin down the 
reasons why there is a difference between a poem written by a poet and a schizo-
phrenic’s “word salad” (Weisberg, 2010, 237). In form, they may be identical, but 
intention and meaning are ascribed to the former. However, such judgements about 
intentions rely on an agent-centric model of creativity, perhaps rather, the solution 
is to accept that ambiguity and instability at the very centre of that which we call 
creative.
Ambiguity is an essential but often overlooked part of ignorance. It relates to 
when we cannot know what the answer is simply because there is no correct answer. 
It is related to fallibilism but moves beyond this to suggest that in some cases, it is 
not possible to know a single meaning, because there are multiple plausible mean-
ings which are mutually exclusive. Take, for example, the example of the duck and 
the rabbit made popular by Wittgenstein (1953; Fig. 3.2). This disrupts stable ideas 
Fig. 3.2  Rabbit/duck 
illusion. (Wittgenstein, 
1953)
3  Creative Ignorance

48
of knowledge because it points to those moments during which the final arbiter of 
the form is not the person who drew it but the person who is viewing it.
Horton writes that “ambiguity…is not only desirable for drawing but …a neces-
sary condition for visual culture” (Horton, 2015, 1). Ambiguity is relational – it 
exists not in the objects itself for the object just is, rather ambiguity exists in the 
relationship between the object and the person viewing it. It is part of the meaning-­
making which we engage in through the process of interaction with the world. It is 
for this reason that the idea of art is so hard to pin down: the shifting category is not 
a property of anything other than the relationship between the viewer and the 
viewed. The simple fact is that there is often no answer to the question so that 
knowledge here can only be knowledge that the meaning making is provisional and 
apt to shift.
This shifting and relational ontology means that ignorance is a fundamental part 
of creativity. Creativity is not an objective attribute that can be tied down to a clear 
set of processes or forms. What is novel and what is useful are relational terms 
which will always be unclear. The object just is, the process just is, the person 
just is.
3.3.2  The Ignorance of Material Engagement
Creativity is necessarily the manifestation of something and that something neces-
sarily has a material form. This is trivially true. There is no experience of creativity 
without the act of creating even if that act is simply articulating sub-verbally an idea 
which has been growing in the head. Moreover, creative thoughts dissipate without 
being realised and sometimes even in the act of realisation become intangible. Once 
we resituate even the simplest creative and generative task, then we are forced to 
reconsider the nature of more obviously engaged creativity and that requires taking 
the material world seriously. The socio-material world in which creativity takes 
places is marked by ongoing and dynamic interactions with people and things. In 
this section, I wish to address the fundamental unknowability of interacting with 
materials.
These interactions are marked by uncertainty. Uncertainty is closely linked to 
ignorance; it describes a profound unknowing which is consciously experienced 
through the course of engaging with the world. It is often uncomfortable. Beghetto 
(2020) suggests that there are two forms of uncertainty people can face – first, where 
the uncertainty is unexpected and habitual ways of acting are no longer good guides 
to future actions. In this case, the aim is to resolve this uncertainty. The second way 
is deliberately designing situations which generate uncertainty in an effort to 
increase the full range of possibilities that are available. Material engagement gen-
erates both types of uncertainty. This section looks first at the way that interaction 
with material generates the first form of uncertainty, that is the uncertainty which 
means that habitual gestures are not a clear guide to how to progress. This uncer-
tainty comes from an ignorance about the nature of the materials which transcends 
W. Ross

49
the skill required to mitigate that uncertainty. Skilled engagement requires not eras-
ing the uncertainty but learning to mitigate it.
Rich empirical data from semi-structured interviews or case studies provide sup-
porting evidence for a model in which the material environment is not accepted as a 
passive scaffold for creativity but actively shapes the process (Malafouris, 2013). 
This involvement in the creative process lends the material a form of agency which 
elsewhere has been called material agency. For some scholars, agency cannot be 
decoupled from intentionality, but there is an increasing move to decouple the sense 
of agency from the act of agency itself. As Pickering (1995, p. 51) writes with refer-
ence to Glaser’s bubble chambers:
Now I can clarify my sense of material agency. It is simply the sense that Glaser’s detectors 
did things-boiling explosively or along the lines of tracks or whatever-and that these doings 
were importantly separate from Glaser.
When material engagement is viewed as a dynamic process, the objects involved do 
things which are outside of the control of the person and this doing, this process of 
blending material and human intentionalities, is an important aspect of creativity. 
All creativity has a form and when that form is a material one, the artist cedes some 
agency to the material which she works (see Ross & Vallée-Tourangeau, 2020, for a 
longer discussion of this distributed agency).
For instance, the work of Glăveanu et al. (2013) challenges the person-centred 
notion of creative agency across a broad range of creative domains: artists, design-
ers, scientists, writers and musicians. What emerges from the results of their series 
of interviews is a productive tension between human and material agency. For 
example, the artists interviewed suggest that “objects resist the intentions of the art-
ist. All of a sudden, objects “ask a question” and very often “change the original 
plan,” being “stronger” than the creator, “imposing their rules”.” (p. 5). Designers 
spoke of a collaborative relationship with the materials “from the need to explore 
materials, to “test their limits”, to the frustrations one experiences when not “feel-
ing” the fabric” (p. 7). Even the chemist (not a domain traditionally associated with 
material play) described their creative process in terms of a “game with mat-
ter” (p. 8).
Although there have been several calls to recentre the material in our understand-
ing of human behaviour and cognition (Barad, 2003; Orlikowski, 2007), it is per-
haps particularly surprising that relationships with the material are under-emphasised 
in creativity research (Tanggaard & Beghetto, 2015) where there is a necessary 
entanglement with material. To create is to produce something concrete, the ephem-
erality of a novel thought moves from imagination to creativity when it is enacted 
and not before. The argument in this chapter, therefore, suggests that creative pro-
cesses are constituted not by internal computations over mental representations of 
the artist’s materials but through and by those materials (Bardt, 2019; Wheeler, 
2018). This is not to suggest that internal processes are erased but rather that they 
are manifest through the act of creating and it is this act which is necessarily engaged 
with material.
3  Creative Ignorance

50
Importantly, if we allow this form of material agency, then we also invite uncer-
tainty into the creative process and undermine the idea that creativity involves cer-
tainty so often required in the laboratory definition. Rather, if we take seriously the 
recentring of the creative act away from the person and towards the interaction 
which emerges from the process of engagement, then we are required to embrace 
material uncertainty and ignorance. While it is clearer that interactions with people 
will always involve a negotiation with a lack of knowledge and certainty, it may not 
be so clear with materials which are seen as being fixed and immutable. However, 
this creative uncertainty can be traced through the very matter which constitutes the 
creative material; there is a fundamental ignorance at the heart of working with 
material. This can lead to risk such as that described by Schwalbe (2010, p. 107) 
coming from the sheer unknowability of a block of wood:
There is also the risk of investing hours in turning a piece only to discover rot and cracking 
that can’t be worked around. There is the risk of misorienting the raw wood and failing to 
make the best use of a grain pattern that is revealed only as a piece is cut. There is the risk 
of severe cracking during the months it takes a roughed-out piece to dry prior to final turn-
ing and finishing. Skill reduces these risks but can’t eliminate them.
A similar point is made by Baber et al. (2014) who go on to emphasise the lack of 
determinacy in this form of materially engaged workmanship much like the discus-
sion on uncertainty discussed above. In this sort of work, the outcome is not guar-
anteed and the sketchy plan that may be present in the mind of the craftsperson (in 
this case a jewellery maker) is one “which crystalizes through the developing inter-
action between craftworker, tools, and materials being worked” (p. 6).
Thus, in embodied and situated creativity, it is more helpful to consider igno-
rance as multiple and taking place across multiple scales each with an attached level 
of granularity driven, in part, by the properties of the material which are unknow-
able in advance but instead reveal themselves in action. This material unknowability 
undermines a hylomorphic model of creativity which assumes that the material is a 
passive recipient of the ideas of the maker (Ingold, 2010).
3.3.3  Skills for Ignorance
Once we accept that the role of the materials is key to understanding the generation 
of a novel thought and that creativity as a category is meaningless without consid-
eration of its manifestation, then the focus of empirical research shifts from under-
lying psychological traits or cognitive states to understanding the ongoing unfolding 
of creative action. This decentring of the human means that sciences that wish to 
only focus on the human would need to consider skills beyond the ones that have 
been the traditional area of focus. Cognitive skills become aligned with skills of 
action and interaction because cognition is action and interaction. Understanding 
creativity no longer requires strict focus on the skills that are often measured in the 
laboratory, and which develop from the underlying belief that things are bound in

51
the head, but rather creative cognition can be understood as emergent from the com-
plex and heteroscalar relationship between maker and material.
Recently, Samantha Copeland (2022) suggested that we understand this form of 
engagement through the lens of metis or “cunning wisdom.” Contrasting metis with 
the classical forms of reasoning of techne and episteme, she argues that the skill 
aligned to metis is the skill of responsiveness rather than that of knowledge-based 
preparedness or material engagement. Rather metis represents a combination, an 
interaction of both other forms of reasoning, requiring a dynamic and real-world 
engagement which is familiar and comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. 
Metis in this sense is a clearer way of describing the interplay of human and mate-
rial agency as it unfolds in the process of a reciprocal engagement. This allows 
moments of enacted luck and chance to emerge from the creative process because it 
relies not on the way the plan is designed in the mind of the designer but rather on 
the way that the plan is enacted. Too often we view knowledge states as static, yet 
the flow of ideas in the world requires a more pragmatist perspective on knowledge 
in which thought and understanding arises from indeterminate situations and is con-
structed in the process of resolving the doubt caused by those situations which mark 
the continual and unceasing experience of moving through the world (Dewey, 1910).
This is important from a psychological perspective. Psychology tends to focus on 
static properties of an individual or situation. These psychometric properties are 
designed to fix what is a dynamic process and reduce it to facilitate a clear examina-
tion of the component parts. However, as outlined above, this carries the problem-
atic assumption that the parts remain the same when fixed as when in motion, but 
we need to move away from fixed and static conceptualisations. As outlined above, 
without a consideration of the realisation of material form then current research in 
psychology can only clearly claim to be researching creative potential. Yet potential 
itself is unstable, searching forward as it does for a wide range of possibilities. 
Rather, we need a more forward thinking and dynamic approach to both creativity 
and cognition. Our very understanding of creativity needs to embrace the ignorance 
which is central to all interactions with an uncertain future.
3.3.4  Seeking Uncertainty: Ignorance Niches
I have proposed that the interaction with materials generates a form of ignorance 
which skill can mitigate. While this is under theorized in the literature on creativity, 
it is not entirely unanticipated as can be seen by the range of evidence. What this 
following section will argue turns on the second of Beghetto’s forms of uncertainty: 
That is an uncertainty or ignorance which is not intended to be resolved but one 
which sits at the heart of the creative act and is essential to it. This form of creative 
ignorance is less intuitive and is a stronger argument against applying rationalist 
forms of knowledge to the creative process. This ignorance is marked by two things. 
First, that the creative person seeks out uncomfortable states of ignorance not to be 
3  Creative Ignorance

52
resolved but as an end state in themselves. Second, that creativity emerges from the 
paradox of comfort with discomfort.
It is not only Keats who suggested that tolerance of ignorance is key to under-
standing creativity, interviews with creative professionals suggest that they actively 
seek out moments of discomfort and epistemic darkness not with the aim of reduc-
ing them but of embracing them. Often this translates itself to a need to both embrace 
and create those things which are ambiguous in final form, other times it is con-
cerned with the role of uncertainty. At all times, it is concerned with an unknowing 
of the final form. Creative people create patterns and use strategies that actively 
force them into a state of ignorance in relation to their surrounding world and envi-
ronment. Makri et al. (2014) explicitly documented the strategies employed by cre-
ative professionals to increase moments of serendipity and creativity. Of these, the 
first was an acceptance of ignorance, as he writes: The visual artist explained that 
“creative practice is always moving into the darkness.”
Contrast this with the traditional image of creativity addressed above as marking 
an illumination. What is key is that this is also an intentional state that is sought after 
by creative people despite its discomfort: Creative people work hard to generate 
moments of darkness and of unknowing. These creative “cognitive niches” (Clark, 
2008) exist not so that creativity can be sparked from the resolution of the unknow-
ing, but in full awareness that the unknowing is a constant state. Ignorance in these 
moments is the aim rather than a resolution of that ignorance. This is not a comfort-
able process. March (2019, 140) clearly outlines the discomfort associated with this 
loss of agency and reminds us that “art […] replaces certainty with doubt.”
The point I wish to make here is that while rational and linear process of creative 
thought argues that the aim of creativity and innovation would be to shed light on 
this darkness, the practice of creative professionals suggests that such light shed-
ding would frustrate the very practice that they are aiming to shed light on. In other 
words, the idea of creativity as a light bulb illuminating the dark does not map onto 
what creativity is when it is considered in coordination with the world. Creativity is 
rather familiarisation and comfort with the dark and with the uncertain. Creative 
professionals build ignorance niches that deliberately destabilise their knowing not 
in order to resolve that state but to live in it. They are not seeking the comfort of 
clarity but rather the generative uncertainty of the shadows.
3.4  Creative Ignorance
I have outlined a series of characteristics of creativity and its interaction with igno-
rance. First, I suggest that the “light bulb” moment of a new idea is also an artefact 
of the experimental situation rather than intrinsic to creativity itself, and I have sug-
gested instead that we replace this with the notion of a shadowing. Crucially, I make 
the argument that this shadowing is essential to creativity. First, by describing how 
ambiguity is at the heart of the creative act both conceptually and when it is part of 
the experience of engaging with the material realisation of creative ideas. Second, I 
W. Ross

53
have shown how creative people actively seek out moments of ignorance and doubt 
not to resolve them but to live in that moment.
Such a relationship between ignorance and creativity requires us to rethink some 
of our existing categorisations of ignorance. Has and Vogt (p. 17) offer us a taxon-
omy of ignorance:
Suppose Socrates knows nothing about fashion. Indeed, he could not care less about it. Call 
this attitude Preferred Ignorance. Suppose further that he understands the concept atom, 
namely, smallest indivisible component of the physical universe, but he does not take him-
self to be in a position to assess whether such components exist. He also has some ideas 
about the nature of value. But as he tries to articulate what precisely it is that he takes the 
good to be, he must admit that he does not know. In both cases, we may speak of Investigative 
Ignorance. Socrates’s ignorance motivates him to take an interest in physics, though he 
leaves investigation in this field to others. And his ignorance fuels his thinking about value. 
Other cases are such that one is unaware of one’s ignorance. Suppose Socrates holds firmly 
that a divine being corresponds with him, though he is deluded about this; or, say, he affirms 
that there is a wolf approaching, though it is his neighbor’s dog. Call this Presumed 
Knowledge. There could also be a kind of ignorance where one does not hold any attitude 
to that which one is ignorant about. Perhaps Socrates has never even heard of dinosaurs, or 
more generally, of beings that once existed but are extinct. This is a kind of Complete 
Ignorance.
For each of these, the state of ignorance is one which is either not recognised (for 
Presumed Knowledge and Complete Ignorance) not desired (Investigative 
Ignorance) or not important (Preferred Ignorance). Although the category of 
Investigative Ignorance is closest to the form of ignorance discussed to date because 
it is an ignorance which is revealed in action, it does not capture either the deliberate 
elicitation of the ignorance state or the accepting of this discomfort without the 
desire to resolve. For this, a novel category, that of “creative ignorance,” is required 
to fully understand how creativity and ignorance are entangled in the process.
Creative ignorance describes a form of ignorance as yet uncharted in the litera-
ture which has four key features. It is a knowing ignorance. That is, the people 
experiencing ignorance are aware that they are experiencing moments of ignorance 
and doubt. This ignorance and doubt can cause discomfort. Despite this, it is a wel-
come ignorance. That is, it is both sought out and tolerated: in this instance, aware-
ness of the ignorance does not lead to the need or desire to resolve it despite the 
discomfort it entails. It is a necessary ignorance. That is, without it the creative act 
would not be creative. Finally, it is an irresolvable ignorance. That is, because cre-
ativity is emergent from the interaction of people and things across different tempo-
ral time frames the creative product is unstable and unknowable.
In this way, the notion of creative ignorance proposes that when we track interac-
tion in the world, when ignorance is recast from a state characterised by a lack of

processes and the ambiguity of the resultant forms cannot resolve because of its 
dependency on multiple contradictory perspectives.
Thus, creative ignorance moves beyond the idea of an isolated thinker who 
examines and draws on rational processes to resolve this uncomfortable state and 
generate an immutable novel idea which then takes form, to draw from evidence 
concerning the nature of the process of interaction with the world. Under this frame-
work, the idea does not precede the form, rather form and idea co-emerge and co-­
respond and so states of either ignorance or knowledge are entangled. Ignorance is 
often represented as a state rather than a process, but creative ignorance is not a 
solid or stable state, rather it is a dynamic interplay between knowing and unknow-
ing which crucially does not aim at or require resolution. Creativity emerges from 
that dynamic.
3.5  Conclusion
This argument in this chapter had a dual purpose. First, to challenge the idea that 
laboratory-based conceptions of creativity reflect creativity as it unfolds in the real 
world rather than being a reflection of the tools and tasks used to elicit creative 
states. This demonstrates that the tight link between certainty and creativity is not a 
necessary link but is rather an artefact of the experimental situation.
I have used creativity over the course of this chapter as a way of understanding 
the way in which the rational approach to knowledge, as a linear progression from 
darkness to light which is valorised by enlightenment approaches to knowledge, 
may be disconnected from human experience. The value of ignorance is precisely in 
its stimulatory properties which are required to be experienced not with hope of 
resolution but as generative in itself. Creative ignorance is a special form of igno-
rance which is both embraced by creative people and revealed and sustained through 
interactions with the material and social world. It is heavily reliant on the skilled 
elicitation and exploitation of the unknowing wrought by engagement with the 
socio-material world. However, I contend that this model can extend to other forms 
of knowledge once we move from viewing knowledge as something that either 
graces or not a static state and rather is something which is part of a process of 
engagement with an uncertain world.

Extended Ignorance
Duncan Pritchard
Abstract  According to extended cognition, a subject’s biological cognitive pro-
cesses can become integrated with features of the subject’s cognitive environment 
(and thereby “extended”), such as technology. When such extended cognitive pro-
cesses lead to knowledge, the knowledge that results is extended knowledge. This 
chapter explores how the phenomenon of extended cognition relates to the episte-
mology of ignorance. In particular, our concern will be with not only forms of 
extended cognition that are epistemically problematic (and which one might be 
expected to have negative epistemic ramifications) but also forms of extended cog-
nition that are generally epistemically sound. As we will see, some prima facie 
plausible arguments for how extended cognition might lead to ignorance are not 
compelling on closer inspection. In addition, some other ways in which extended 
cognition might lead to ignorance depend on the account of ignorance that one 
endorses, and in particular whether one opts for a normative or nonnormative 
account of ignorance.

4.1  Extended Cognition and Ignorance
According to the extended cognition thesis, a subject’s cognitive processes can 
extend beyond her biological cognitive processes to take in elements of the subject’s 
environment as proper parts.1 So, for example, in the right conditions, one’s cogni-

tive processes, including one’s biological memory, can be integrated with technol-
ogy that performs a memorial function such that the subject’s memorial cognitive 
processes are extended, in that they involve both unextended biological components 
and extended technological components.2 In this way, a technological device, such 
as a smartphone, might potentially serve a memorial cognitive function, as when 
one compensates for one’s failing memory by using this device to perform certain 
kinds of memory tasks (like keeping track of phone numbers).3
The extended cognition thesis represents a radical departure from traditional 
ways of thinking about cognition. It also raises lots of further questions. For exam-
ple, if there are extended cognitive processes, then does it follow that there are also 
extended mental states (this is the closely related extended mind thesis)?4 Also, 
given that not just any employment of external resources like technology amounts 
to extended cognition, what does it take to integrate these external resources with a 
subject’s on-board cognitive processes to lead to extended cognition? Relatedly, if 
extended cognition is possible, then just how widespread is it?
For our purposes, we can bracket some of these foundational questions. In what 
follows, I will take it as given that extended cognition is not only possible but also 
increasingly widespread as technology becomes ever more seamlessly integrated 
into our lives. Our interest is instead in the epistemic ramifications of extended cog-
nition, especially with regard to ignorance (i.e., its negative epistemic 
2 Note that we are here focusing on cases of extended cognition that involve the contribution of 
technological factors. There are two other forms of extended cognition of note in this regard. The 
first concerns the possible contribution of a subject’s embodied processes to cognition, what is 
known as embodied cognition. For some recent discussion of this thesis, see Noë (2004), Chemero 
(2009), Rowlands (2009), and Shapiro (2011). Consider, for example, how the use of gestures can 
have a bearing on a subject’s cognition processes, as discussed in Clark (2013), Wheeler (2013), 
and Pauw et al. (2014). The second concerns the possible contribution of other cognitive subjects 
within a subject’s cognitive processes, what is known as socially extended cognition (this is also 
known as distributed cognition). For discussion, see Hutchins (1995), Tollefsen (2006), Krueger 
(2011), and Gallagher (2013). Finally, note that technological extended cognition needn’t involve 
technology that is external to the skin of the cognitive subject, as one can imagine cases where the 
technology in question is directly embedded within the biological subject (and hence is to this 
extent “internal” to the subject, even though it is “external” to her on-board cognitive processes). 
This is so-called neuromedia. For discussion, see Lynch (2014) and Pritchard (2018b). See also 
Carter and Pritchard (2019), which discusses the general question of the epistemology of cognitive 
augmentation.
3 The famous case of extended cognition (and extended mind—see footnote 4) given in Clark and 
Chalmers (1998) is precisely of this kind, whereby a subject (“Otto”) with memory-loss caused by 
Alzheimer’s disease uses a notebook to supplement his biological memorial cognitive processes.
4 Interestingly, it was the extended mind thesis that was originally proposed in the famous paper by 
Clark and Chalmers (1998), with the extended cognition thesis merely noted as part of the support-
ing case. There are at least arguably distinct theses, however, in that in endorsing the latter one 
doesn’t seem to thereby be committed to endorsing the former (even if these two theses might natu-
rally be thought to go together). See Giere (2010) and Goldberg (2012) for discussion of why one 
might accept the extended cognition thesis while rejecting the extended mind thesis. For a very 
useful recent overview of the extended mind/cognition theses, and how best to understand them, 
see Sprevak (2019).

ramifications). In particular, does the growth in extended cognition lead to new 
ways in which we might be ignorant, or at least suggest that we are likely to be more 
ignorant than before?5
In what follows, I will take it uncontentious that extended cognitive processes 
can lead to epistemic states like knowledge. That is, one might be skeptical that 
extended cognitive processes can ever result in bona fide knowledge, but I will be 
setting this kind of concern to one side for our purposes. Call an extended cognitive 
process that leads to a true extended belief that satisfies the conditions for knowl-
edge extended knowledge.6 Note that it doesn’t follow from that fact that extended 
cognitive processes can lead to extended knowledge that they do. In particular, there 
might be specific reasons why an extended cognitive process might in practice lead 
to beliefs that have a dubious epistemic pedigree. Accordingly, it will be useful to 
our discussion to divide our concerns into two categories. On the one hand, there are 
natural concerns about how epistemically problematic extended cognitive processes 
(i.e., those that regularly result in false beliefs or at least true beliefs that have a poor 
epistemic pedigree) can generate ignorance. On the other hand, there are also con-
cerns about whether generally epistemically sound extended cognitive processes 
(i.e., those that regularly result in true beliefs and extended knowledge) can none-
theless generate interesting forms of ignorance.
4.2  Epistemically Sound Extended Cognition
I will start by considering how epistemically sound extended cognitive processes 
might nonetheless lead to ignorance. Let’s imagine that extended cognitive pro-
cesses develop in such a way that they are generally reliable at producing extended 
knowledge. It follows that as we become increasingly integrated into highly techno-
logical environments, so our acquisition of knowledge (and true belief) also becomes 
increasingly concerned with extended knowledge (and true belief) rather than 
knowledge (and true belief) simpliciter. In particular, we will have an ever-­expanding 
5 Despite the extensive discussion of the epistemological ramifications of extended cognition in the 
theoretical literature, this is, surprisingly, an underexplored topic, at least to the extent that it 
engages with contemporary work on the epistemology of ignorance. See, however, Arfini (2021) 
for a recent discussion of a slightly different question, which is the extent to which we can under-
stand ignorance itself as an extended epistemic standing.
6 For further discussion of extended knowledge (including the socially extended knowledge that 
arises from socially extended cognition—see footnote 2), see Pritchard (2010, 2018a, 2019, forth-
coming-a), Carter et  al. (2014, 2018a, b), Clark (2015), Palermos (2014), and Palermos and 
Pritchard (2016). See also the burgeoning literature examining the relevance of extended knowl-
edge (and thus extended cognition) to educational contexts: Pritchard (2014, 2016, 2018b), 
Heersmink and Knight (2018), Kotzee (2018), and Pritchard et al. (2021).

body of information available to us which can be directly (albeit extendedly) known 
via our extended cognitive processes.7
How might this growth of extended knowledge have a bearing on ignorance? On 
the face of it, after all, any growth in knowledge ought to mitigate against ignorance. 
I will be considering two possible implications. The first is that the growth of 
extended knowledge leads to a withering of one’s body of on-board cognitive pro-
cesses. If so, then could this indicate the emergence of a new kind of ignorance? The 
second concerns the implications of having a greater body of information epistemi-
cally accessible to one via extended cognitive processes. Does this entail that one is 
more susceptible to a charge of ignorance insofar as one does not epistemically 
exploit these extended cognitive processes? Let’s take these issues in turn.
The first issue can be expressed in terms of the following argument:
P1) The more we are reliant on extended cognitive processes, the less we employ our purely 
on-board cognitive processes.
P2) The less we employ our purely on-board cognitive processes, the less epistemically 
effective they are.
P3) The less epistemically effective our purely on-board cognitive processes are, the less we 
acquire epistemic standings like knowledge and true belief from these sources.
C1) The more we are reliant on extended cognitive processes, the less we acquire epistemic 
standings like knowledge and true belief from our purely on-board cognitive processes. 
(From P1, P2, P3).
P4) Ignorance is to be understood as the absence of an epistemic standing, such as the lack 
of knowledge or the lack of true belief.
C2) The less we acquire epistemic standings like knowledge and true belief from our purely 
on-board cognitive processes, the more susceptible we are to being ignorant. 
(From C1, P4)
The first premise is contentious because it is not at all clear why a technological 
cognitive augmentation should thereby lead to a reduction in use of one’s corre-
sponding on-board cognitive processes. One can see the rationale in play: if one can 
use one’s smart phone to, say, remember phone numbers, then why would one com-
mit phone numbers to one’s biological memory? But that rationale doesn’t really 
stand up to closer inspection. Sure, one might not need to use one’s biological mem-
ory to recall phone numbers anymore, but that doesn’t mean that one doesn’t con-
tinue to employ one’s biological memory for other tasks. Accordingly, there’s no 
inherent reason why one’s use of one’s biological memory as a whole should sub-
side just because certain kinds of memorial tasks have been off-loaded to the 
extended cognitive process. Of course, (P1) is an empirical claim, so ultimately 
whether it is true is something that cognitive science will determine.
The second premise looks to be in better shape. Again, the rationale in play here 
is fairly clear: if one doesn’t use one’s biological memory, for example, then this 
7 This has been viewed as a problem for extended cognition and, thereby, for extended knowledge 
too, in that it entails that one’s cognitive (and thus epistemic) reach goes far beyond what we might 
otherwise have expected—this is what is known as cognitive (and epistemic) “bloat.” For discus-
sion of the problem of cognitive bloat, see Rupert (2004) and Allen-Hermanson (2013). For discus-
sion of epistemic bloat, specifically, see Bjerring and Pedersen (2014), Ludwig (2015), and 
Smart (2017).

cognitive capacity will atrophy and hence will no longer be as epistemically effec-
tive. That certainly looks plausible, at least given that we grant that there is a skill-­
like dimension to this cognitive capacity, such that it can be trained to be more 
effective through practice, and hence can be weakened by lack of use. Of course, 
(P2) is also an empirical claim, and so its truth is something that we would expect 
cognitive science to determine, but unlike (P1), it at least seems to be antecedently 
plausible that it is true.
In contrast to (P1) and (P2), (P3) looks to be the kind of claim that can be assessed 
a priori. So construed, it also looks straightforwardly true, in that it is hard to see 
how an epistemically weakened cognitive process could not thereby result in less 
knowledge or true belief on this whole. Since (P2) also looks compelling, and since 
the inference to (C1) is clearly valid, this means that what is really carrying the 
weight of the argument to (C1) is (P1).
What about the plausibility of (P4)? It is common in the literature to understand 
ignorance in terms of the absence of an epistemic standing, with the two most domi-
nant proposals in this regard concerned with either the lack of knowledge or the lack 
of true belief.8 Accordingly, on standard views of ignorance, (P4) would straightfor-
wardly follow. Interestingly, we are going to be considering an alternative to these 
popular views of ignorance below. This alternative proposal won’t make any sub-
stantive difference to the plausibility of (P4), however, since it effectively imposes 
a further restriction on conventional accounts of ignorance that understand igno-
rance in terms of the absence of an epistemic standing (and in that sense is compat-
ible with such accounts), so we can reasonably set this to one side for our current 
purposes.
Perhaps the weakest point in the argument concerns the transition from (P4) to 
(C2). It might look superficially appealing, in that the lack of epistemic standing at 
issue in (C1) seems to directly translate, via (P4), into ignorance. But look closer 
and one can see that there is a lacuna here. For all that really follows from the 
8 For some key defenses of the so-called standard view (in virtue of its widespread adoption) of 
ignorance in terms of lack of knowledge, see Zimmerman (2008), Le Morvan (2011a, b, 2012, 
2013), and DeNicola (2018). For some of the main defenses of the so-called new view of ignorance 
as the lack of true belief, see Goldman and Olsson (2009), van Woudenberg (2009), and Peels 
(2010; cf. Peels 2011, 2012). Of course, one can imagine distinct accounts of ignorance in terms 
of a lack of an epistemic standing that diverge from the standard or new views (such as ignorance 
as the absence of justified true belief, say, or the absence of an awareness of the target fact), but for 
convenience, we will henceforth follow convention and focus on these two epistemic standings. 
These two main contemporary accounts of ignorance are usefully surveyed in Le Morvan and 
Peels (2016). Note that we are here focusing on propositional forms of ignorance—see Nottelmann 
(2015) and El Kassar (2018) for two recent discussions of nonpropositional forms of ignorance and 
how they relate to the propositional variety. There is a much broader contemporary literature on 
ignorance that extends beyond the question of how we should define ignorance, such as the politi-
cal implications of ignorance (e.g., Medina 2017), though usually such work, if it takes a stance on 
the nature of ignorance at all, commits to a particular definition of the term that conforms to the 
idea that it picks out the absence of an epistemic standing. See, for example, Fricker (2016, 144), 
who endorses the standard view of ignorance, and Mills (2007, 16), who endorses the new view of 
ignorance.

combination of (C1) and (P4) is that one isn’t gaining epistemic standings to the 
extent that one did previously from one’s unextended cognitive processes. It doesn’t 
follow from that claim, however, that one is thereby ignorant of the target proposi-
tions, for the simple reason that one might well be gaining (say) knowledge of these 
propositions from one’s extended cognitive processes. Indeed, this is exactly what 
we would expect. Take the example of remembering phone numbers that we gave 
earlier. The shift from using one’s biological memory to employing the technology 
that forms part of one’s extended cognitive process is precisely a way in which one 
tends to have more knowledge and true beliefs overall than before, albeit where this 
expansion in epistemic success is now largely attributable to one’s extended cogni-
tive processes rather than one’s on-board cognitive processes. Accordingly, even if 
one accepts the contentious (P1), and thus the argument to (C1), there is still a way 
of blocking the further inference to (C2). The upshot is that one is, if anything, 
likely to be less ignorant overall than hitherto, rather than more so.
Is there a way to rework this argument so that it survives these objections? One 
possible thought in this regard is that while extended cognition doesn’t necessarily 
lead to an overall increase in ignorance, it does lead to a specific kind of ignorance, 
in that one is now more likely to have less knowledge and true belief from one’s 
on-board cognitive processes than before. In other words, while the growth in 
extended cognition might lead to more extended true belief and knowledge (and 
thus less ignorance overall), it leads to less unextended true belief and knowledge, 
and hence more ignorance of a specific kind that is concerned with one’s unex-
tended epistemic states.
The problem, however, is that it is hard to make sense of what this claim amounts 
to. Take the case of a particular phone number where the subject has extended 
knowledge (and thus true belief). Is there any coherent way of claiming that the 
subject is thereby ignorant of this proposition, albeit in a manner that is indexed to 
a particular type of cognitive process? It’s hard to see how this would work. In gen-
eral, two subjects who both have knowledge of a proposition are both equally non-
ignorant—the manner in which they acquired that knowledge simply doesn’t come 
into it.
For example, consider two subjects who each know a specific proposition, albeit 
via different routes. So, for instance, they each know that Moriarty is the murderer, 
but while the first subject (Sherlock) knows this because he witnessed the crime, the 
second subject (Watson) knows this because he was told this by Sherlock, who he 
knows to be a reliable informant. Is there any sense in which Watson is ignorant of 
this proposition that is somehow indexed to first-person experience, or in which 
Sherlock is ignorant of this proposition that is somehow indexed to testimony? I 
think the implausibility of this suggestion reveals the oddity of thinking that there is 
a specific kind of ignorance that is indexed to nonextended cognitive processes.9
9 One might think that there are other kinds of case that are more amenable to the claim in play. For 
example, consider two subjects who know a mathematical theorem in very different ways: the first 
subject knows it because she proved it, while the second subject knows it only via testimony (and 
lacks the means of proving it). Isn’t there something that the second subject is ignorant of that the

4.3  Normative and Nonnormative Conceptions of Ignorance
This brings us to the second issue we have raised regarding extended cognition and 
ignorance, which is whether the growth in extended cognition might make one more 
susceptible to ignorance, in that there is now a wider body of information that one 
ought to be aware of.
What drives this issue is the thought that there is a normative dimension to igno-
rance, in that to describe someone as ignorant is to do more than merely claim that 
they lack a certain epistemic standing—such as knowledge or true belief, on the two 
standard accounts of ignorance (though for convenience I will henceforth focus on 
the former). The thought is that an ascription of ignorance also entails that this per-
son has exhibited an intellectual failing in this regard, such that to be ignorant is to 
be unaware of a fact that one ought to be aware of.10 This normative dimension to 
ignorance would explain why, for example, we wouldn’t describe someone as igno-
rant for failing to know something that they couldn’t possibly know, either because 
it is in principle unknowable or because it is practically unknowable, at least 
for them.
For example, it would be odd to treat someone as being ignorant about distant 
unrecorded facts about the past, such as what Caesar had for breakfast on the day 
that he crossed the Rubicon. This simply isn’t something that one could realistically 
know, and if one had a true belief about it, it could only be by virtue of a lucky 
guess.11 There is thus no intellectual failing on display with regard to one lacking 
knowledge in this regard. Indeed, not only would one not manifest an intellectual 
first subject is not ignorant of? Yes, but notice that this ignorance doesn’t concern the target propo-
sition, as neither of them are ignorant of that. It rather concerns further propositions that are con-
cerned with the proof in question (such as what inferential principles are involved in the proof). In 
the same way, there might be propositions related to the target proposition that Watson fails to 
know (/truly believe), but which Sherlock knows (/truly believes), on account of the fact that his 
knowledge of the target proposition is testimonial. But that would be irrelevant to the point in hand, 
as it doesn’t show that he exhibits a kind of ignorance as regards that specific proposition. In any 
case, these scenarios where there is a possible wider ignorance in play are not relevant to extended 
knowledge/true belief anyway, as we’ve been given no reason for supposing that knowledge/true 
belief acquired via extended cognitive processes is likely to be associated with this form of wider 
ignorance when compared with the corresponding knowledge/true belief acquired via non-
extended cognitive processes.
10 See Pritchard (2021b, forthcoming-b) for a development of a view of this sort. See also Pritchard 
(forthcoming-c) for the application of this proposal to debates regarding God’s omniscience. 
Notice that this proposal is in a certain way orthogonal to the conventional accounts of ignorance 
in the literature that understand it in terms of the absence of a particular epistemic standing, as one 
could supplement this normative component to whichever epistemic standing is at issue in a con-
ventional account of ignorance (one would just need to fill in the placeholder notion of what it is 
to be “aware” of the target fact accordingly).
11 Indeed, it is far from clear that one can form a belief via guesswork—at least in the sense of 
belief that is relevant to epistemology anyway (i.e., that propositional attitude that is a constituent 
part of rationally grounded knowledge)—as to believe a proposition in this sense is to believe that 
proposition to be true. If that’s right, then one cannot form a belief (in the specific sense just 
described at least) about a proposition where one is aware that one has no basis for regarding the 
target proposition as true.
4  Extended Ignorance

failing by lacking knowledge of this truth, but one would manifest an intellectual 
failing by trying to find it out (or by groundlessly forming a belief about it). That an 
attribution of ignorance would be inappropriate in this case, even despite the lack of 
knowledge, suggests that ignorance has a normative dimension. In particular, where 
a truth is epistemically inaccessible—that is, such that there is no feasible route to 
knowing it—then one doesn’t count as being ignorant for failing to know it.
There are thus truths that nobody knows which aren’t thereby truths that we are 
ignorant of. The more interesting kind of case, for our purposes, however, are truths 
where a lack of knowledge for one person might count as ignorance even though 
that same lack of knowledge in another person wouldn’t count as ignorance. I think 
there are a number of factors that can lead to this kind of relativity of ignorance. I 
will here consider three: the practical importance of the truth in question for that 
person, the epistemic availability of that truth for that person, and whether that per-
son elects to form a belief about the proposition in question.
Consider first how the practical importance of a truth can be relevant to whether 
lacking knowledge of it amounts to ignorance. Notice that we don’t attribute igno-
rance to subjects who fail to know truths that are completely trivial, such that there 
would be no good reason for them to know them, even when those facts are epis-
temically available to the subject. For example, one could determine what every 
café in town has on their menu if one were so inclined—there is no great practical 
barrier to this knowledge, beyond the time involved—but what would be the point? 
There are far better things to be spending one’s time doing, including better things 
to be devoted to knowing. This is why we wouldn’t ordinarily attribute ignorance to 
someone for failing to know what all the cafes in town have on their menus, as there 
is no intellectual failing involved in such a lack of knowledge (indeed, there would 
be an intellectual failing involved in them seeking out such knowledge). They are 
unaware of the relevant facts, but they are not thereby ignorant of them, as these are 
not facts that that they ought to be aware of.
What would be pointless knowledge for most people wouldn’t necessarily be 
pointless knowledge for everyone, however. We can imagine jobs that require some-
one to know things such as what is on café menus (perhaps, they are tasked with 
compiling a central list for the tourism board). In this case, however, a failure to 
possess the relevant knowledge could be deemed ignorant—one could imagine our 
subject’s boss, for example, exclaiming that she can’t believe that her employee is 
ignorant of something so important to their position. Thus, the practical importance 
of a truth can be such that one person’s failure to know it doesn’t amount to igno-
rance but another person’s failure to know it does.
Now consider how the epistemic availability of truths can have a bearing on 
ignorance. We’ve already noted that some truths are epistemically inaccessible, 
which means that they aren’t epistemically available to anyone (such as what Caesar 
had for breakfast on a certain day). Accordingly, we don’t regard someone’s failure 
to know them as ignorance. Interestingly, however, there is a kind of epistemic 
availability that can be variable depending on the individual at issue. For example, 
we don’t tend to call small children ignorant for failing to know such things as who 
the President of France is, even though we would call their parents ignorant for 
D. Pritchard

67
being in the corresponding situation. The crux of the matter is that small children 
aren’t in a position to know these things, and so there is no intellectual failing on 
their part in their not knowing them.
What goes for small children applies more generally to anyone whose epistemic 
access to the relevant facts is similarly restricted. We do not normally describe dis-
tant civilizations as being ignorant of truths known only to the contemporary world, 
such as claims about quantum physics, for example. To do so would imply an intel-
lectual failing on their part, but that would be improper, given that they simply 
weren’t in a position to know these things. Interestingly, there is an asymmetry in 
how we treat ancient civilizations on this score that is relevant here. We do not treat 
them as being ignorant of the important reference points of our world (e.g., our sci-
ence), but we are far more inclined to treat us as being ignorant of the important 
reference points of their world. The normative dimension to ignorance can account 
for this, in that it is far more plausible that our lack of knowledge reveals an intel-
lectual failing on our part (lack of curiosity, for instance), than that their correspond-
ing lack of knowledge reveals an intellectual failing on their part.12
The third kind of variability concerns whether a subject elects to form a belief 
about a proposition. At any one time, there will be an unlimited range of truths that 
are, quite rightly, of no great practical importance to one, and as a result, one doesn’t 
form any belief about them. Consider current showbiz trivia, for example. If this 
isn’t important to me (in contrast, say, to a showbiz gossip columnist), then there is 
no reason why I should form any belief about whether, say, Jo-Lo and Ben Affleck 
are back together (which is a live showbiz issue at the time of writing). If I do 
become aware, from a reliable source, that they are now an item again, and so form 
a true belief to that effect, then I can obviously come to know what I believe. 
Crucially, however, if I never come to have a belief in this regard, and so lack this 
knowledge, then that wouldn’t make me ignorant, as there is no reasonable expecta-
tion that I should form any belief about this subject matter. A wide range of truths 
are like that: they are epistemically accessible to one, but since there is no reason-
able expectation that one should know them (even though there might be an 
12 An interesting case is that of contemporaneous people who deliberately elect, perhaps with good 
reason, to epistemically cut themselves off from the wider world. For example, the Sentinelese 
tribe who inhabit North Sentinel Island in the Bay of Bengal are the most isolated group of people 
in the world, who avoid almost all contact with the outside world. As a consequence, there will be 
a wide range of propositions that are epistemically inaccessible to them, such as much of modern 
science. But would we say that these tribespeople are ignorant of these facts? That sounds improper 
to my ear. Even so, one might argue that this case is disanalogous with the ones just considered, in 
that the people in question have chosen to epistemically cut themselves off. In general, after all, 
one cannot avoid the charge of ignorance on the grounds that one chooses to not know something. 
I think it matters, however, what kinds of reasons one has for choosing to not know certain facts. 
As I’ve argued elsewhere, for example—see Pritchard (forthcoming-b, forthcoming-c)—if one has 
good reasons for not knowing something (as, e.g., when a lawyer refuses to consider trial evidence 
that has been released them in error), then this would not count as ignorance. My instinct is that 
“good reasons” here could include such considerations as a shared cultural objective to preserve 
one’s traditional customs by shunning contact with the outside world, though obviously this issue 
extends well beyond our current concerns.
4  Extended Ignorance

68
expectation that others know them), one doesn’t count as being ignorant as a result 
of failing to form a belief about them.
Interestingly, however, if one does form a belief about this subject matter, even 
in circumstances where there is no reasonable expectation that one should, and 
one’s belief is false, then a charge of being ignorant of this fact would become 
appropriate. This may not be a truth that one ought to know simpliciter, but it is a 
truth that one ought to know insofar as one forms a belief about it. One can thus 
count as ignorant by forming a false belief it even though one wouldn’t count as 
ignorant if one simply opted to form no view about the target subject matter. Whether 
one counts as ignorant can thus depend on whether one forms a belief about the 
target proposition.
The upshot of the foregoing is that whether a subject’s lack of knowledge 
amounts to ignorance depends on whether they have exhibited the relevant intel-
lectual failing, and that this can depend, in turn, on several variable factors in play, 
such as the practical importance of the proposition at issue, the epistemic availabil-
ity of the knowledge that is lacking, and whether the subject elects to form a belief 
about the target proposition (and possibly other factors too).
It is the relationship between the epistemic availability of the truths in question 
and ignorance that is most relevant for our current purposes. It is relevant because 
of how the proliferation of extended cognitive processes makes a wider range of 
knowledge epistemically accessible. On the plus side, insofar as extended knowl-
edge is bona fide knowledge, then we are in a position to know a great deal more 
than we did previously, as the technology enables to us to immediately know facts 
that might have hitherto required a lengthy inquiry (indeed, which may have been, 
practically speaking, beyond one’s grasp). On the negative side, however, this wider 
epistemic availability of truths entails that we are exposed to a far greater scope of 
ignorance, in that in lacking knowledge of truths we can now be charged with being 
ignorant of them even though previously a lack of knowledge would not have 
entailed ignorance.
We can express the argument in play here as follows:
P1*) The proliferation of extended cognitive processes makes a much wider range of facts 
epistemically accessible to subjects than would have been epistemically accessible 
previously.
P2*) In order for a subject to count as ignorant for lacking knowledge, the relevant truth 
must be epistemically accessible to that subject.
C*) The proliferation of extended cognitive processes doesn’t only lead to an expansion of 
(extended) knowledge, but also to an expansion of (extended) ignorance. (From 
P1*, P2*)
The first premise, (P1*), seems relatively uncontroversial. One could argue that 
the contemporary expansion of epistemically accessible facts has more to do with 
the general availability of technology—in particular, access to the internet—than it 
does with extended cognitive processes specifically. Nonetheless, it is surely the 
case that the proliferation of extended cognitive processes would have a significant 
bearing of the range of truths epistemically accessible to the subject. The second 
premise, (P2*), is just a statement of the normative account of ignorance. The weak 
D. Pritchard

69
point in the argument doesn’t lie in the premises, however, but rather concerns the 
fact that the conclusion doesn’t follow from these premises.
All that actually follows from these premises is that there is a greater range of 
facts that we can be held to be ignorant of as a result of the proliferation of extended 
cognitive processes. But this doesn’t entail that we are more ignorant, or even that 
we are likely to be more ignorant, as it is consistent with this claim that this wider 
class of epistemically accessible facts is not only epistemically accessible, but also 
epistemically accessed, in the sense of being known. Indeed, we would expect this 
to be the case, given that the extended cognitive processes are doing their job. In 
particular, there is a dilemma in play here. Either one’s extended cognitive pro-
cesses are functioning as they ought—and remember in this regard that we are cur-
rently working on the assumption that extended cognitive processes are generally 
epistemically sound—in which case it is not only the case that a wider range of facts 
is epistemically accessible, but also that these facts are known. But then the subject 
isn’t ignorant of these facts. Or else they are not functioning as they ought, and 
hence not leading to extended knowledge, but then the facts weren’t being made 
epistemically accessible via the extended cognitive processes. In that case, however, 
then insofar as a charge of ignorance would have been inappropriate previously due 
to a lack of epistemic access to the facts in question, then it would still be inappro-
priate. Either way, then, there is no growth in ignorance as a result of a proliferation 
of extended cognitive processes.
4.4  Epistemically Problematic Extended Cognition
Thus far we have been focusing our attention on whether generally epistemically 
sound extended cognitive processes—that is, extended cognitive processes that reg-
ularly result in true beliefs and extended knowledge—might lead to ignorance. The 
arguments we have considered for how this might occur have been found to be 
inconclusive. But what about epistemically problematic extended cognitive pro-
cesses— that is, extended cognitive processes that don’t generally lead to true 
beliefs and extended knowledge? Here the prospects are, unsurprisingly, more 
promising, though as we will see the details tend to depend on the account of igno-
rance in play.
One straightforward kind of case where this might occur would be concerning 
propositions that we would have hitherto tended to form true beliefs in, and thereby 
gain knowledge of, but where the introduction of an extended cognitive process 
leads one to form false beliefs. Perhaps, for example, one’s biological memory was 
generally reliable, and so a good source of memorial knowledge, but the extended 
memorial cognitive process that has been introduced is in fact highly unreliable (it 
is designed to manufacture false memories, say), and hence is not a good source of 
memorial knowledge. Now, it seems, we can be ignorant of truths that we would 
have hitherto known (and so not been ignorant of).
4  Extended Ignorance

70
Notice that if one subscribes to the normative account of ignorance described 
above, then this might potentially insulate subjects from a charge of ignorance of 
this kind. It rather depends on how the extended cognitive process is brought about. 
If, for example, the subject is deceived about the unreliability of the extended cogni-
tive process, and has no reasonable way of spotting that it is epistemically defective, 
then that should absolve the subject of a charge of ignorance. For while they now 
lack knowledge they would have had previously, the truths in question are no longer 
epistemically accessible to the subject. In short, the epistemically problematic 
nature of the extended cognitive process in play has the reverse effect to the one 
noted above, in that it is reducing rather than expanding the scope of truths that one 
can count as being ignorant of. Whether this kind of case is to be understood as 
extending ignorance thus depends on whether one opts for either the normative 
account of ignorance or one of the conventional, nonnormative accounts of 
ignorance.
A second kind of scenario that is interesting for our purposes is when subjects are 
led, via the extended cognitive process, to forming beliefs about topics that they 
would never have (quite rightly) previously considered. Imagine now that those 
extended cognitive processes are also epistemically defective, in that, for example, 
they are leading us to systematically form false beliefs in this regard. Perhaps, for 
example, advertisers are able to influence our extended cognitive processes to 
prompt us to form false beliefs that are useful to them, such as regarding how a 
particular toothpaste is far superior to all its competitors (a topic that most reason-
able subjects would have previously been unlikely to form any beliefs about).13 Now 
there are truths that one fails to know because one’s beliefs are epistemically defec-
tive (in this case because they are false) where previously one failed to know them 
because, quite reasonably, one didn’t form any belief about them at all.
According to conventional, nonnormative accounts of ignorance, this kind of 
case doesn’t concern an increase in ignorance, as the fact that the subject didn’t have 
knowledge (say) of the target proposition previously would entail that she was 
already ignorant of it. On the normative account of ignorance, in contrast, this could 
potentially be a case where ignorance is being created by the extended cognitive 
process, given that the agent wasn’t previously ignorant in failing to believe, and 
thus failing to know the target proposition. Everything now depends on whether, on 
this account, the unreliable extended cognitive processes are making us more igno-
rant, by ensuring that our lack of knowledge now qualifies as ignorance even though 
it didn’t previously.
Whether this is so will again depend on the details of the case and, in particular, 
on whether one has sufficient responsibility for the error. For example, on one ver-
sion of this scenario, the extended cognitive processes lead us to form false beliefs 
in much the same way that, say, advertisements in general can lead us to form false 
beliefs—that is, they apply techniques that will generally lead to these beliefs being 
13 Another more disturbing kind of case could be fake news—that is, roughly, information that is 
presented as news, and yet designed to be systematically misleading (e.g., Pritchard 2021a)—that 
is delivered via an extended cognitive process.

71
formed, but such techniques are resistible if one is sufficiently alert to them. If that’s 
how we are to think of the extended cognitive processes in play, however, then their 
proliferation should make responsible believers be more cautious about forming 
beliefs in certain subject matters, just as they would be in ordinary cases involving 
the testimony of advertisers. Accordingly, if they fail to exercise caution, and so are 
led to form false beliefs as a result, then they will now count as ignorant where they 
would previously have only counted as lacking knowledge (because they didn’t 
even form the target belief).
In contrast, if the extended cognitive process is not resistible in this fashion—if 
it functions more like a kind of indoctrination, say—then I think that would tend to 
exclude the agent from the charge of being ignorant, as they would not be culpable 
for their lack of knowledge. All that would have changed is the reason why they fail 
to have knowledge, in that it is now because they have a false belief in the target 
proposition rather than no belief at all.
This discussion is relevant to one specific way in which extended cognitive pro-
cesses might generate ignorance, which is in terms of making us be more confident 
in our beliefs about certain subject matters than we should be. This has been an 
observed consequence of our internet access to widespread information, as people 
tend to be misled by their superficial grasp of a domain into making confident judg-
ments about it.14 If internet access has this effect, then we would expect something 
similar to occur, perhaps even in a stronger form (as the informational input would 
feel more like their own knowledge), when subjects have access to the same infor-
mation via extended cognitive processes. Such overconfidence is, however, clearly 
epistemically problematic, in that it will lead subjects to form false beliefs about 
topics that they would previously have demurred from forming a judgment about 
(since they were aware of their lack of expertise). Moreover, unlike the example 
given above concerning the advertisers, there need be no deceit or manipulation 
involved, as what is causing the overconfidence is rather just human fallibility and 
cognitive bias in the context of extended cognitive processes.
This kind of case looks to be quite a straightforward way that extended cognition 
might lead to ignorance. Notice, however, that the conventional, nonnormative 
accounts of ignorance would struggle to accommodate this claim. After all, if the 
agent previously lacked a belief in the target propositions (and hence lacked knowl-
edge of them), then it follows that they were already ignorant of them. In contrast, 
on the normative account of ignorance at least, it is possible that there was no igno-
rance involved in the subject lacking a belief in this regard—perhaps this simply is 
not something that they ought to know, and thus have a belief about. Hence, in cases 
in which that condition is met, such that the subject wasn’t previously ignorant of 
the target propositions, then this could constitute a scenario where ignorance is 
being generated via extended cognitive processes. Whether this is so would depend, 
on the normative account of ignorance, on whether the subject is culpable for the 
14 In particular, it seems that subjects conflate the material that they read online with information 
that they have previously learnt and understood, and this leads them to be overconfident in their 
judgments. See, Fisher et al. (2015) and Carter and Gordon (2020).

false beliefs that she is forming. Crucially, however, given that such overconfidence 
is a cognitive flaw on the part of the individual, then we would tend to hold the sub-
ject responsible in this regard. They ought to be more careful in how they form their 
beliefs to correct for this overconfidence. Accordingly, a charge of ignorance is 
appropriate, just as we treat subjects who, as a result of exposure to the information 
on the internet, overconfidently form false beliefs.
4.5  Concluding Remarks
We have examined a range of ways in which extended cognitive processes, both 
epistemically sound and epistemically problematic, can lead to ignorance. More 
specifically, we have considered two arguments for how epistemically sound 
extended cognitive processes might generate ignorance and found that they are not 
promising on closer inspection. Moreover, while we have seen that epistemically 
problematic cognitive processes can lead to ignorance, the exact manner in which 
this occurs can depend on the account of ignorance in play, and in particular on 
whether one opts for a conventional, nonnormative account of ignorance in terms of 
the absence of a target epistemic standing (such as knowledge or true belief) or a 
normative account that in addition regards ignorance as involving an intellectual 
failing. Of course, we have not considered all the myriad ways that extended cogni-
tive processes might lead to ignorance, but the upshot of the foregoing is to make at 
least a prima face case for thinking that whether the widespread use of extended 
cognitive processes leads to the proliferation of ignorance turns on some quite spe-
cific details about how these processes are employed (e.g., where they have a ten-
dency to make us overconfident in our judgments, and hence prone to error).15

Mindshaping, Racist Habits, and White 
Ignorance
Michelle Maiese
Abstract  Theorists such as Charles Mills have argued that racism and white 
supremacy are pernicious, in part, because they result in an “epistemology of igno-
rance” whereby white people come to know the world in systematically distorted 
ways. Drawing upon insights from the enactivist approach and associated notions of 
habit and mindshaping, I argue that so-called white ignorance is the result of over-
determining social influences that frequently operate covertly and lead to inflexible 
habits of mind. These socially inculcated habits make it difficult for individuals to 
attend to relevant considerations, form accurate interpretations, or revise their 
beliefs in response to new evidence. But in addition, white subjects actively, though 
not necessarily self-consciously or intentionally, maintain their ignorance and 
investment in whiteness in order to hold on to racial privilege, preserve their self-­
image, and avoid painful confrontations. In my view, an enactivist account of mind-
shaping and habit can help us to make sense of how subjects are both molded by 
their social environment, and also play an active role in enacting and reproducing 
oppressive patterns of cognitive and practical engagement.

5.1  Introduction
Charles Mills (2007) notes that mainstream epistemology has been classically indi-
vidualistic, ignoring the way in which class, racial, or gender situatedness impacts 
what and how people know. In his view, standpoint theory rightly emphasizes that 
knowers are socially situated and that members of oppressed groups often notice 
and understand things that members of dominant groups do not. Proponents of

standpoint theory have emphasized that knowledge and ignorance are essentially 
socio-political: “different social positions and power relations tend to encourage or 
discourage different modes of knowing, ignoring, revealing, and dissembling” 
(Whitt, 2016, 431). Building on this body of work, Mills maintains that the notion 
of a “group-based cognitive handicap” is a straightforward corollary of standpoint 
theory: if one group is epistemically privileged, then there must be another group 
that is epistemically handicapped (2007, 15), in part because they are ignorant of the 
conditions of their own privilege.
Mills (2007) highlights a kind of ignorance (a nonknowing) in which race and 
white racial domination play a crucial role (20) and maintains that white ignorance 
centrally involves cognitive distortions that need to be historicized and understood 
in relation to the social-structural causes that help to produce them. This expands 
upon ideas presented in The Racial Contract, where Mills (1997) describes socially 
enforced cognitive norms to which members of the epistemic community are 
expected to adhere. Agreement with the officially sanctioned reality (in which 
Whites are dominant) allows some subjects to be granted full cognitive membership 
in the (white) epistemic polity, whereas challenging or resisting white supremacy 
leads them to be viewed with suspicion or even dismissed as crazy. Thus, largely as 
a result of enculturation, white subjects come to live “in an invented delusional 
world, a racial fantasyland, a ‘consensual hallucination’” regarding “fabricated pop-
ulations, countries that never were, inhabited by people who never were” (Mills, 
1997, 18). Members of the racial polity learn to see the world inaccurately and are 
subjected to “constant cultural pressure to accept these counterfeit images as real 
currency” (80). All the while, they receive assurance that their mistaken interpreta-
tions of people and events count as accurate explanations.
This results in the spread of misinformation, pervasive forms of error, and what 
Mills describes as “a particular pattern of localized and globalized cognitive dys-
functions (which are psychologically and socially functional), producing the ironic 
outcome that whites will in general be unable to understand the world that they 
themselves have made” (Mills, 1997, 18). Mills (2007) rightly notes that even cog-
nizers who are not overtly racist are likely to form mistaken beliefs due to the sup-
pression of pertinent information, and that Black people can manifest white 
ignorance as well. He also acknowledges that white ignorance is not uniform across 
the entire white population, and that some white people are largely able to overcome 
it. Thus, white ignorance is best understood as a “cognitive tendency” or doxastic 
inclination, one which is not insuperable (Mills, 2007, 23).
There is an important distinction to be made between white ignorance that is 
willful and that which is tacit and structural. This corresponds to a distinction 
between someone who is directly racist, and someone who is indirectly racist 
(largely as a result of social-structural causation). In the former sort of case, igno-
rance is deliberately cultivated, and white people may even strategically feign igno-
rance as a tactic of domination (Milazzo, 2017, 568). Such individuals may very 
well display overt racism or more intentionally cling to their unknowing as way to 
maintain dominant power structures and hold onto their privileges. However, my 
focus in this paper is on white ignorance that is tacit, and which is generated largely

systematically, by way of various social forces and structures. To suppose that white 
ignorance is always a charade would be to overlook the structural forces that encul-
turate white people as ignorant (Moore, 2019, 264). Along these lines, Mills (2007) 
points to subjects’ socialization into a racist belief-set, inherited culture and tradi-
tion, inculcated social amnesia, skewed inferential patterns, and deficient concep-
tual apparatus. All these cognitive distortions, according to Mills, are structurally 
engendered. Thus, subjects may very well form mistaken beliefs and display white 
ignorance even if they are not overtly racist (Mills, 2007, 21).
One example is how white supremacy is maintained through historical amnesia 
and the management of memory. As I began working on this paper in the early sum-
mer of 2021, the United States commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa 
race massacre in Oklahoma, and many people commented on how they had never 
learned about these events in school. This is a powerful example of how the deliber-
ate decisions of historians and educators shape how the nation’s story is told and 
effectively “white-wash” history. To acknowledge that white ignorance is inscribed 
in textbooks, generated and reinforced in ceremonies and holidays, and perpetuated 
by way of statues and monuments is to grant that it is a social-structural phenome-
non that exists beyond any one individual. Memory and understanding are social, 
and founded upon the testimony, background assumptions, and conceptions of oth-
ers. Subjects inherit categories, background belief-sets, and assumptions from their 
cultural milieu (Mills, 2007, 24). In a society structured by relations of domination, 
prevailing interpretations are likely to be shaped by the biases of the dominant 
group; these structurally embedded biases influence what and how we see, what we 
choose to remember, whose testimony is solicited, and which facts are sought out 
and accepted. Still, we cannot understand the generation and persistence of white 
ignorance without also examining the agency and investments of individuals.
I argue that insights from the enactivist approach can help us to understand the 
interplay between social-structural factors and individual factors in the production 
of white ignorance. In the next section, I outline an enactivist conception of mind-
shaping and maintain that by way of habit formation, social influences are internal-
ized and become anchored in the body in the form of recurring patterns of practical 
and cognitive engagement. In Sect. 5.3, I argue that social influences can become 
overly deterministic and result in inflexible habits of mind that make it difficult for 
subjects to attend to relevant considerations, integrate different kinds of informa-
tion, and revise their beliefs in response to new evidence. Thus, “white ignorance” 
and its associated habits are largely socially transmitted and sustained, and result in 
patterns of atrophied moral cognition that are widespread across society. But in 
addition, individual white subjects actively, though not necessarily self-consciously 
or intentionally, maintain their ignorance and investment in whiteness in order to 
hold on to racial privilege, preserve their self-image, and avoid painful confronta-
tions. In Sect. 5.4, I argue that although habits are molded by the social environ-
ment, subjects also exhibit agency with respect to the ongoing enactment of their 
habits. Thus, it is a mistake to suppose the white people are “subjected to rather than 
co-creators of and agents in the world” (Milazzo, 2017, 565), just as it is a mistake 
to suppose that they simply are co-creators of that world and in no way subjected to

it. My proposed enactivist account emphasizes that they are both subjected to social-­
structures, and also play an active role in reproducing associated habits—or alterna-
tively, of resisting and challenging them. In Sect. 5.4.1, I examine the case of Black 
Pete in the Netherlands as an illustration of some of these key ideas.
5.2  Enactivism, Habits, and Mindshaping
Whereas mainstream approaches in cognitive science depict cognition as individu-
ally realized and implemented by the brain, the enactivist approach (Weber & 
Varela, 2002; Thompson, 2007) emphasizes that cognition and affectively are more 
fully embodied, environmentally situated, and relational. An enactive agent does 
not passively form an internal representation of objects in the surrounding world, 
but rather actively “brings forth” meaning. What enactivists term “sense-making” is 
the process whereby self-regulating living systems (such as human animals) create 
and maintain their own domain of meaningfulness through efforts to adapt and pre-
serve their identity (Di Paolo, 2005; Thompson, 2007). In order to regulate and 
sustain themselves, living organisms must continuously exchange matter and energy 
with the environment, and what counts as a useful resource depends on their bodily 
structure, needs, and the way in which they are coupled to their surroundings. 
Among animals, ongoing sensorimotor engagement is a principal mode of self-­
regulation and adaptive sense-making.
For human animals with sophisticated nervous systems, self-regulation and 
adaptation go well beyond survival and biological self-maintenance and have much 
to do with faring well in a specific sociocultural context. Over the course of learning 
and socialization, subjects form enduring patterns of bodily engagement and 
response and become selectively attuned to specific aspects of their surroundings. 
Cognitive processes of perception and action involve ongoing feedback loops 
between an animal and its environment, which together comprise a complex 
dynamic system. Whereas mainstream discussions of cognition focus on represen-
tations and information processing, the enactivist approach emphasizes that the 
mind “is made out of habits, and by habit” (Egbert & Barandiaran, 2014, 2). 
Crucially, habits should not be understood as rigid stimulus-response patterns or 
stereotyped behavior whose execution is completely automatic and unaware. Rather, 
they are best understood in terms of built-up patterns of bodily responsivity and 
coordinated movement that constitute a situation-sensitive, flexible ability to navi-
gate changing surroundings.
Such flexibility is buttressed by the fact that human life is characterized not by a 
single self-reinforcing habit, but by “bundles of habits” (Barandiaran, 2017) that 
include patterned ways of moving, of speaking, of handling artifacts, and of inter-
acting with others. What Buhrmann and Di Paolo (2015) call “sensorimotor coordi-
nations” are particular sensorimotor patterns that an agent reliably uses to perform 
a task, and what Di Paolo et al. (2017) call “sensorimotor schemes” are organiza-
tions of sensorimotor coordination patterns that often are enacted together and in 
M. Maiese

81
combination with other schemes. Over the course of behavioral development, 
behaviors are integrated into more complex sequences and “actions are linked into 
functionally coherent ensembles” (Di Paolo et al., 2017, 148). As these structured 
behaviors become integrated with other sensorimotor patterns and are directed 
toward achieving goals, subjects develop skills associated with cooking, playing 
sports, driving cars, and using technology. The sensorimotor schemes that enable 
these activities are mutually supporting, and there are constraining relations between 
acts that constitute a kind of internal logic: sensorimotor schemes “relate to each 
other in complex, adaptive ways, forming webs of mutually supporting relations” 
(Di Paolo et al., 2017, 142) that allow the agent to engage in a wide range of goal-­
directed activities.
These patterns of neurobiological dynamics and sensorimotor coordinations are 
self-sustaining and self-reinforcing: “the more frequently a pattern of behavior (i.e., 
sensorimotor coordination trajectory) is performed, the more likely it will be 
repeated in the future” (Egbert & Barandiaran, 2014, 3). Elements that support a 
habit, such as muscular dispositions and neural connectivity patterns, depend for 
their structural stability on the exercise of the sensorimotor coordination patterns; 
these supporting elements are precarious in the sense that they become unstable if 
they are not exercised frequently enough. The exercise of a habit influences other 
sensorimotor schemes and subsequent behavior patterns such that they are similar 
to behaviors that have been executed in the past. A given scheme calls for, rein-
forces, or inhibits others, and the interdependence of schemes makes them richer in 
potentiality. What emerges is a self-sustaining behavioral “life form” that integrates 
brain, body, and sensorimotor dynamics and allows for new forms of coordinated 
activity. And because the habitual, skillful body sometimes “takes over” and renders 
conscious reflection unnecessary, agents find themselves with the mental and practi-
cal “space” to focus on other things. Thus, habit formation is crucial for effective 
and intelligent engagement with our surroundings, and yet, the longer a habit oper-
ates, the less obvious or noticeable it becomes.
While enactivist theorizing about habits has focused largely on sensorimotor pat-
terns and overt movement, it is important to acknowledge that habits also are 
embodied in coordinated patterns of attention. Just as sensorimotor patterns are 
reinforced through repetition, what subjects tend to notice, emphasize, or ignore is 
modulated by what they have paid attention to in the past. In addition to habits asso-
ciated with coordinated and skillful movement, human subjects develop specific 
habits of interpretation and judgment. Such habits of mind encompass schemas for 
interacting and engaging with one’s environment, and include, for example, a ten-
dency to notice particular considerations, to be guided by particular assumptions, to 
make specific kinds of inferences, and to trust some sources of evidence while 
remaining suspicious of others. Fully embodied habits of mind arise in conjunction 
with sensorimotor habits, via the formation and self-maintenance of coherent neu-
robiological configurations and built-up patterns of bodily attunement and engage-
ment. These interdependent, self-stabilizing patterns of behavior and attention vary 
depending on context and what sort of endeavor is undertaken; “particular sets of 
habits will be regularly displayed by an agent depending on his current activities” 
5  Mindshaping, Racist Habits, and White Ignorance

82
and context (Ramírez-Vizcaya & Froese, 2019). As a result of ongoing interaction 
with the surrounding world, there emerge sets of structured habits that allow sub-
jects to engage effectively with a wide range of socio-material environments (see 
Arfini, Chap. 10, this volume).
Egbert and Barandiaran (2014) note that habits resemble autopoietic biological 
processes in that both sorts of processes of self-maintenance are “contingent upon 
the existence of an appropriate environment” (10). However, what is unique about 
the human form of life is the significant influence of social-relational factors: many 
habits are formed over the course of our interaction with complex sociocultural 
environments. Just as biological processes of self-maintenance depend on energetic 
resources, the formation and maintenance of habits depend on social resources. 
Many habits develop over the course of continued interaction with a culture as sub-
jects develop recurring patterns of behavior tailored to specific contexts. Moreover, 
a human subject’s adaptive regulation of environmental engagement is governed not 
just by viability constraints imposed by “survival conditions,” but also by the need 
to fare well in a particular sociocultural setting. Shared cultural practices scaffold 
individual enactments of meaning by “prescribing and normalizing certain modes 
of experience and action while proscribing (and perhaps pathologizing) certain oth-
ers” (Kirmayer & Ramstead, 2017). Customary ways of performing various tasks, 
dividing up resources, making decisions, speaking, thinking, and feeling all become 
second-nature. Insofar as the sociocultural environment regulates and molds indi-
viduals’ habits of behavior and attention, it modifies their neurobiological dynamics 
and patterns of bodily attunement. How does this occur?
Coordination and shared activity appear to be at the center of human sociality. 
De Jaegher and Di Paolo (2007) characterize “coordination” as the nonaccidental 
correlation between two or more coupled systems, so that their behavior matches to 
a degree far beyond what is expected given what those systems are capable of doing. 
Once two or more interactors are part of a coupled system, their expressions, behav-
iors, and bodily dynamics modulate those of the other person (s). Habit, posture, 
and body alignment begin to resonate, so that other people exert a contagious pull—
often without our being self-consciously aware of it. Instances of mutual coordina-
tion in the realm of human activity include synchronization, mirroring, anticipation, 
and imitation (De Jaegher, 2009). These forms of reciprocal bodily attunement 
(Stanghellini, 2004, 91) and mutual modulation begin when we are infants and grow 
more complex over time as we develop a range of projects that require us to com-
municate with others, understand their actions and intentions, and enlist their assis-
tance. Such coordination, repeated over time, results in highly integrated 
configurations of neurobiological activity and movement that become sedimented 
in the body; the formation of such habits involves a dynamic, multistable network 
of brain and bodily processes, including the musculoskeletal system, metabolic sys-
tems, the endocrine system, and the cardiovascular system.
Building on these ideas, my proposed mindshaping thesis says that human agents 
are fully embodied, and that their sense-making processes and habits are partially 
determined, or shaped, by the social world (Maiese & Hanna, 2019). This notion of 
mindshaping emphasizes that habit formation is inherently interactional, and that 
M. Maiese

83
the “partial determination” or “shaping” of our embodied habits is fundamentally 
normative. Remember that at a basic biological level, living organisms gauge mean-
ing and value in relation to norms of self-maintenance and adaptivity. But at a more 
sophisticated level, social norms and values that are underdetermined by biology 
come into play; these normative constraints are acquired via interaction with the 
sociocultural environment. Social structures prescribe and prohibit ways of think-
ing, acting, and interacting, and thereby both regulate action and constitute the 
meanings and rules that enable the enaction of social life. Cultural norms are inter-
nalized and enacted not just as individual habits, but also as forms of coordinated 
social interactions in which there is a reliable expectation that others will respond to 
or complement one’s own action in specific ways. For those operating within a par-
ticular social setting, “certain models of expectancy come to be established, and the 
patterns, which over time emerge from these practices, guide perception as well as 
action” (Roepstorff et al., 2010, 1056).
What Rietveld and Kiverstein (2014) call “situated normativity” encompasses 
norms of adequacy and inadequacy associated with particular sociocultural settings. 
Various societal structures and forces contribute to mindshaping, including cultural 
institutions, pervasive symbols, various forms of media, and political discourses and 
institutions. Together, these sociocultural forces normalize and reinforce habitual 
attitudes and dominant patterns of meaning-making. As children engage with par-
ticular aspects of the environment, their performance is subject to normative assess-
ment as better or worse, and as more or less correct, given the specific demands of 
the situation and sociocultural norms. By way of explicit nudging or implicit com-
munications of approval/disapproval, children learn to attend to the “right things” 
and focus on some facts and considerations rather than others. They thereby acquire 
the habits of mind of their community, and if they fail to respond or behave as 
expected, they will be corrected, scolded, or formally sanctioned, and also encour-
aged to adjust their attitudes and behavior. Those who internalize these cultural 
expectations “develop dispositions to participate in the practices fluently and to cor-
rect those who don’t,” so that there is a kind of “social regulation system” that molds 
people’s attitudes and behavior (Haslanger, 2019, 21). In some cases, children even 
receive explicit instructions that contribute to their habitual patterns of engagement. 
For example, if a child is repeatedly told, “you say ‘colored woman’ and ‘white 
lady’—never a ‘colored lady’” (Bailey, 1998, 35), they are likely to develop a habit 
of viewing women of color with disrespect. However, in many cases, these lessons 
are unspoken. White children pick up on the avoidance of eye contact, the nervous-
ness, and the spatial layout of where people sit, and all these affectively charged 
elements help to cultivate specific habits of mind. By way of emotional resonance 
and mimicry, children learn to feel “at ease in white worlds where [they] are fluent 
speakers, where [they] know and can safely animate whitely scripts, where people 
of color are out of [their] line of vision, and where [their] racial identity is not at 
risk” (Bailey, 1998, 40). People comply with social norms and expectations partly 
because there is a sense in which it contributes to their human flourishing, as mem-
bers of a social group. Some interactions with the sociocultural world are adaptive 
insofar as they enable the individual to fare well in that social environment (e.g., to 
5  Mindshaping, Racist Habits, and White Ignorance

84
gain status and social recognition), and some are maladaptive (insofar as they 
involve heavy penalties or social disapproval).
Thus, from a young age, subjects are socialized into epistemic communities in 
which there is an officially sanctioned reality that they are expected to endorse. At 
the core of this officially sanctioned reality is “white normativity,” which involves 
the centering of Europeans and Euro-Americans as normal, ideal, or even excep-
tional. This narrative is reinforced by way of textbooks, media, political discourse, 
ceremonies, and official holidays (e.g., Columbus Day). These social forces help to 
generate an “implicit agreement to misrepresent the world…coupled with constant 
cultural pressure to accept these counterfeit images as real currency (Bailey, 2007, 
80). Those who internalize white normativity habitually view White bodies, identi-
ties, and cultural practices as normal, natural, and right, and may exhibit a lack of 
interest in stories depicting the experiences of people of color. Facts routinely are 
selected and interpreted in accordance with this general framework, so that white-
ness is coextensive with full humanity, and nonwhite “Others” are cast as “savages” 
who are less fully human. This paves the way for an “airbrushed white narrative of 
discovery, settlement, and building of a shining city on the hill” and a denial of the 
extent of Native American and Black victimization (Mills, 2007, 31). Even more 
perniciously, it may result in a racialized moral psychology whereby “the white eye 
is socialized to see lynchings and racialized torture as entertainment worthy of pic-
nics and postcard representations” (Bailey, 2007, 80). Mills (2007) notes that once 
associated assumptions are established in the social mindset, their influence is dif-
ficult to escape and corrective information is routinely resisted (27). This habitual 
stance of white normativity continues to manifest as a refusal to recognize the long 
history of structural discrimination that has left whites with the disproportionate 
wealth that they have today. The guiding assumption, it seems, is that they have 
more resources simply due to talent and hard work.
5.3  Overdetermination, Inflexible Habits, 
and Atrophied Cognition
I argue that the notions of mindshaping and habit can help us begin to make sense 
of the workings of white ignorance and the way in which particular habits of mind 
become overly rigid and deeply sedimented in the body. It is worth noting that 
mindshaping frequently is constructive and enabling insofar as it allows subjects to 
develop the habits and skills associated with various socially defined activities and 
thereby can enable “more sophisticated ways of being and thinking that are indeed 
liberty-inducing” (Matthews, 2017, 404). This is because habits and skills are 
expressive of a practical form of understanding regarding what one can do with 
objects and what sorts of action-possibilities are available (Ingerslev, 2020); they 
have an emancipatory aspect in the sense that they help to anchor an agent in the 
M. Maiese

85
world and enable her to carry out fine-grained adjustments in order to meet the 
demands of her current circumstances.
First, the stability of habit gives an agent the capacity to both control and manage 
her interactions with the environment without having to rely on conscious reason-
ing. Both sensorimotor coordinations and habits of mind gain their effectiveness—
their ability to bring us into various settings as effective agents—by virtue of the 
fact that we have developed particular ways of being in the world that are “on tap” 
and ready to use in an instant (Proctor, 2016). Second, the flexibility of habit allows 
individuals to shift adaptively between different modes of engagement as a situation 
unfolds, in accordance with various social demands. Such poise allows them to 
adjust to variability and unpredictability in a rapidly changing environment. Habit 
formation involves becoming increasingly attuned to bodily regularities and envi-
ronmental contingencies so as to achieve maximal grip on a wide array of poten-
tially relevant considerations and action-possibilities. This requires that agents 
navigate between a wide array of potential environmental couplings and engage in 
“a constant on-going sensorimotor loop of perceiving invitations for action, acting 
on them, perceiving new invitations, and so on” (Weichold, 2018). Ideally, agents 
develop flexible habits of mind that allow them to gauge nuance, attend to relevant 
contextual and situational considerations, and form accurate assessments of their 
social world based on available evidence.
However, habits can lose their flexibility and begin to operate more like 
“unchangeable automatisms” (Di Paolo et al., 2017, 102) that render agents insensi-
tive to relevant considerations and evidence and unresponsive to available options. 
Indeed, because engrained habits of behavior and attention anchor individuals in 
their past experiences, there is always danger that if they become overly rigid, sedi-
mented habits will distort cognition and impede agency. At the extreme, inflexible 
habits can become compulsions or addictions, which include both rigid behaviors as 
well as intransigent thinking patterns (Andreou, 2005; Ramírez-Vizcaya & Froese, 
2019). What is harmful about “bad habits,” in part, is that they put an end to plastic-
ity, so that they possess us instead of our possessing them (Dewey, 1916), causing 
us to engage with our surroundings in narrow, repetitive ways. Dewey observes that 
fixity of habit involves a loss of freshness and openness that typically brings with it 
an aversion to change that makes it difficult to do and think otherwise (ch. 4). Part 
of the problem with these overly rigid habits is that they frequently are the result of 
social influences that operate covertly, so that their impact on the agent’s behavior 
or attention remain hidden from her. Because socially inculcated patterns of think-
ing, acting, and understanding increasingly become a matter of automated frames of 
reference (Thompson, 2013, 306), subjects may lose the capacity to take up critical 
distance from them and begin to rely less and less on their own powers of moral-­
evaluative reasoning.
Thus, although it is true that “human agents always meet by relying on some 
taken-for-granted order of meaningfulness” (Steiner & Stewart, 2009, 544), this 
taken-for-granted order of meanings and social constraints can become overly 
deterministic. Suppose, for example, that particular social influences are so strong 
that they cause the agent to lose sight of relevant possibilities and that a socially 
5  Mindshaping, Racist Habits, and White Ignorance

86
inculcated set of habits comes to dominate an agent’s practical and cognitive iden-
tity. As a result, they lose the ability to judge for themselves which forms of social 
life they see as legitimate (Thompson, 2013) and are relatively unable to call into 
question or reflect upon the social norms and forces that have shaped their lives. 
Such over-determination frequently is accompanied by agents’ lack of awareness of 
(a) their having been shaped by social forces, and (b) the meaning and consequences 
of such shaping. Thus, in cases where social influences are over-determining, there 
is little in the way of active contribution or experimentation on the part of the indi-
vidual. Habits are enacted unthinkingly, outside of conscious awareness, and agents 
may become “stuck” in characteristic behavior patterns that overrule or inhibit the 
expression of other situationally relevant actions; likewise, rigid habits of mind may 
render them blind to relevant considerations and closed off to alternative ways of 
making sense of things. As an agent becomes “stuck” in particular patterns of 
behavior and attention, the usual possibilities for modified engagement may be fore-
stalled; she may not even apprehend particular interactive and interpretive possibili-
ties as genuine options. If stagnant patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting begin to 
overrule or inhibit the expression of other situationally relevant habits (Ramírez-­
Vizcaya & Froese, 2019), individuals will be unable to gain an “optimal grip” on 
available options, incorporate relevant factual information, or imagine the world 
otherwise.
To see how overly rigid habits might operate, consider how “whitely scripts” that 
are internalized at an early age can become embedded in people’s language, bodily 
reactions, feelings, and behaviors (Bailey, 1998). Examples of these scripts include 
being nervous around people of color, avoiding eye contact with them, or adopting 
closed, uncomfortable postures in their presence. The repeated animation (or enac-
tion) of these scripts reinscribes a racial order in which White lives, culture, and 
experience are repeatedly valued and prioritized at the expense of those of people of 
color (Bailey, 1998, 36). Similarly, Yancy describes “acting whitely” as “a form of 
orientation that comes replete with a set of sensibilities that unconsciously/ pre-­
reflectively position or configure the white self vis-à-vis the non-white self” (Yancy, 
2008, 865). Associated racist habits include, for example, suspicious surveilling in 
shops, holding on tightly to one’s handbag, constricted breathing when confronted 
with the Black male body, and distrusting the testimony of people of color. Such 
habits reflect a comportment or mode of responding that has become sedimented in 
the body and is supported by deeply embedded discourses and histories of racist 
praxis (Ngo, 2016). To understand racism as an inflexible habit is to recognize the 
way in which it becomes second nature and encompasses routine patterns of engage-
ment that often are unthinking and unreflective, and which operate insidiously at the 
level of someone’s bodily orientation or bodily register (Al-Saji, 2014).
Along these lines, Al-Saji (2014) describes racializing vision as rigid and immo-
bile: past interpretive patterns are “congealed as schema” and future responses are 
“projected and mapped in advance based on the ossified schemas of the past” (141). 
Because vision’s dynamic ability to change is partially closed down, racialized bod-
ies are seen as naturally inferior and cannot be seen otherwise. This rigidity and lack 
of openness to other responses or interpretations impacts interpersonal 
M. Maiese

87
relationships, making it difficult for people to gauge nuance and be genuinely open 
and receptive to “others as they are” (Ngo, 2016, 859). The perception of Black men 
as dangerous, for example, is routinized through repetition, and without meaningful 
room for variation, so that it is enacted even in cases where all available evidence 
indicates that fear is unwarranted. To illustrate the sort of blindness that is “embed-
ded” in a subject’s “encrusted bodily ways of engaging-in-the world” (Yancy, 2008, 
863), Yancy describes a white woman who encounters a Black man on an elevator, 
does not really see him, and makes no effort to challenge how she sees him. Insofar 
as racializing vision circumscribes and configures what she sees, it narrows and 
distorts her vision, so that alternative interpretive possibilities effectively become 
closed off. Over-determined habits of mind thereby make it difficult for this woman 
to attend to relevant considerations and potentially revise her judgments and inter-
pretations in response to available evidence. Along these lines, Whitt (2016) points 
to “a socially sanctioned and habituated way of being—a mode of actively, if unin-
tentionally, maintaining areas of lucidity and imperception by resisting new knowl-
edge, counter-testimony, and recalcitrant experience” (432).
Building on these ideas, I argue that white ignorance can be understood as a set 
of overly rigid habits of mind that distort how subjects interpret evidence, make 
decisions, and form judgments. While some habits of mind (e.g., genuine openness 
and curiosity) facilitate the development of knowledge, the habits associated with 
white supremacy operate as “crystallized inhibitors” (Glazer & Liebow, 2021, 51) 
that impede knowledge and understanding. In particular, these habits of mind pre-
vent subjects from gathering evidence of racism; discourage them from drawing 
proper inferences from this evidence should they gather it; and prevent them from 
taking responsibility for racism, should they accept that it exists (Glazer & Liebow, 
2021, 52). By focusing on habits of mind, my proposed account emphasizes that 
white ignorance concerns not just the object of knowledge; that is, it is not simply a 
matter of not knowing certain content or information or being unaware of nondomi-
nant understandings of history, reality, or society. Crucially, white ignorance also 
pertains to the subject of knowledge, i.e., the knower, and has to do with self-­
obliviousness, a lack of critical self-reflection, or a failure to grasp one’s own 
cognitive-­epistemic processes (Catala, 2019). White ignorance signifies a dimin-
ished capacity to engage in ongoing interrogation of one’s own habitual modes of 
thinking, feeling, and acting. This lack of self-reflection contributes to oblivious-
ness regarding one’s own habits of mind and prevents alternative perspectives from 
becoming intelligible. Due to their subjective ignorance (their lack of insight 
regarding themselves as knowers), subjects fail to understand not just “the world” 
itself, but also the way in which their own epistemic practices and interpretations 
have been shaped by a racist society. This is connected to what Samantha Copeland 
(Chap. 2, this volume) terms “relational ignorance,” which involves an inability to 
understand one’s own role in an epistemic community, specifically in relation to the 
roles of others. As a result of such ignorance, subjects are unable to undertake a 
“racially conscious self-interrogation” regarding the degree of their own complicity 
in white supremacy and cannot make their own “socialized habits of whiteness” 
transparent to themselves (Noe, 2020, 289).
5  Mindshaping, Racist Habits, and White Ignorance

88
Individuals develop inflexible habits of mind and display the sort of rigidity and 
obliviousness that these theorists highlight due to their reliance on intuitive, ana-
lytic, and diffusive forms of cognition. Insofar as these modes of thinking distort 
subjects’ ability to reason, evaluate information, and view their world critically, 
they cause them to become “stuck” in specific patterns of meaning-making. First, 
agents who display subjective ignorance habitually rely on more intuitive forms of 
reasoning when it comes to race-related topics. When someone is intuitively related 
to their values, they have a habit of reacting immediately and without reflecting on 
the value itself; in many cases, they simply defend beliefs and attitudes that are 
congruent with those that are common in their social community (Thompson, 2013, 
312) and are rewarded with social acceptance and approval. Moreover, in the con-
text of white ignorance, associated epistemic distortions can be functional or advan-
tageous in the sense that they allow white people to thrive at the expense of people 
of color without having to acknowledge their systematic privileges. Grounded rea-
soning, in contrast, centrally involves critical reflection about one’s values, feelings, 
and evaluative beliefs and an examination of whether these attitudes are supported 
by reasons and evidence. This demands that the agent acknowledge and consider 
external forms of information that may challenge or undermine her existing beliefs 
and values.
Second, the concepts that individuals use can be either analytic or synthetic 
(Thompson, 2013, 312); while those whose concepts tend toward the analytic are 
prone to seeing only partial elements of the world, those whose concepts tend 
toward the synthetic are able to integrate more elements of a phenomenon. One 
example of an analytic concept is the category of the “savage,” which casts non-
white Others as lesser beings. Mills (2007) notes that this category and its associ-
ated presuppositions tend to draw someone’s thinking in a particular direction and 
constrain what they can objectively see. Viewing things through this concept (or 
other similar stereotypes) obscures a full picture of social reality and undermines 
subjects’ capacity to make sense of evidence that challenges this conception of 
innate European superiority. Another example of an analytic conceptualization is 
the false binary according to which a person is either racist/bad or nonracist/good. 
This binary sustains the overly rigid habits of mind associated with white ignorance 
by preventing white Americans from critically considering ways in which they con-
tribute to and benefit from white supremacy (Glazer & Liebow, 2021, 59), even if 
they don’t self-consciously intend to do so. It also conceals the fact that racism 
pervades every aspect of their social reality. In addition, subjects may adopt a nar-
row definition of racism that emphasizes irrational prejudice or individual bias and 
thereby both obscures the systemic causes of racism and grants them plausible deni-
ability of their own complicity (Glazer & Liebow, 2021, 57). An example of a syn-
thetic concept that better highlights the complexity of social relations and the way 
in which racism is linked to other forms of structural injustice is “intersectionality” 
(Crenshaw, 1989).
Third, epistemic styles of thinking and considering information can be either dif-
fusive or integrative (Thompson, 2013, 313). Those who rely heavily on a diffuse 
style of thinking are less able to draw coherent links between different kinds of 
M. Maiese

89
information, whereas those who frequently adopt an integrative thinking style are 
able to think in more complex ways and revise their evaluative assessments in light 
of new evidence. Someone who sees the world in a more integrated way will see the 
interrelationships between the race-based discrimination (both past and present), 
poverty, and the policies and social processes that produce it. In contrast, someone 
who approaches the world in a more fragmented way may find it difficult to discern 
patterns across individual cases of disadvantage and discrimination; for example, 
this may lead them to remain ignorant of police brutality as a systemic racial injus-
tice and “stuck” in their habit of seeing the tragic killing of George Floyd as an 
isolated incident. In addition, crucial concepts may be missing, and evidence that 
seems to counter the prevailing narrative about white superiority is likely to be fil-
tered out rather than incorporated into a more nuanced set of beliefs. For example, 
someone might lack the concept of ‘redlining’ and be inclined to think that the main 
reasons that Black people encounter hardships when it comes to housing center 
around lack of hard work, family instability, or a lack of good role models within the 
community (Glazer & Liebow, 2021, 58). Another example is the stance of color-
blindedness whereby subjects claim not to see race and therefore do not integrate 
the reality of racism and white supremacy into their overall understanding of the 
world. This tendency to adopt a more fragmented view of the social world encour-
ages oversimplified, decontextualized, and ahistorical understandings of race-­
related issues and thereby helps to produce the overly rigid habits of mind associated 
with white ignorance.
In addition, subjects may get stuck in habits of distancing whereby they “avoid 
considering their own relation to injustice by directing the conversation toward 
more comfortable or self-affirming topics” (Whitt, 2016, 430). When presented 
with evidence that they benefit from a system of racial injustice, they may eschew 
the opportunity to gain knowledge from the experience, deny the evidence, or rein-
terpret the evidence so as to maintain their moral purity; this prevents them from 
enduring the stress of learning about their unearned advantages (Glazer & Liebow, 
2021, 53). For example, someone might redirect a discussion about official and 
systemic uses of racism into the more benign observation that “we all discriminate 
in one way or another” and that Blacks themselves have occasionally discriminated 
against one another on the basis of skin tone (Whitt, 2016, 430). Whitt maintains 
that distancing is a way for people to “preserve a coherent and familiar sense of the 
world and their place in it” (432). This contributes to their misrecognition of impor-
tant social facts, prevents them from critically examining their world, and promotes 
unreflective epistemic practices. Such distancing frequently is not fully conscious 
(i.e., subjects are not reflectively aware that they are doing it), Whitt maintains; 
rather, it channels “appropriate” ways of thinking and speaking about racially 
charged topics that many subjects have been taught to use. Distancing is problem-
atic insofar as it reinforces blind spots, perpetuates unawareness, and prevents peo-
ple from learning important truths about their world and their lives. It may lead to a 
kind of collective denial or amnesia about the past and its legacy in the present 
(Mills, 2007, 35), which further undermines critical thinking and sustains oblivious-
ness. The upshot is that subjects not only deny their own complicity in injustice, but 
5  Mindshaping, Racist Habits, and White Ignorance

90
also perpetuate and reinforce the power relations and ways of knowing shaped by 
those injustices.
Taken together, these epistemic practices directly result in “a pattern of percep-
tual attentiveness to the world that relegates some significant aspects of it to a murky 
nether region” (Alcoff, 2007, 48). Considerations that are relevant, as a matter of 
fact, are not apprehended as such and thus not appreciated or understood. For exam-
ple, many white people overlook the fact that they have inherited much of what they 
own and that Blacks typically do not have such advantages because of the history of 
discrimination against them. This helps to ensure that whites live in a “racial fantasy-­
land, [or] a consensual hallucination” (Mills, 1997, 18–19). Skewed intake of infor-
mation leads them to construct representations of themselves and others that support 
this fantasy; these cognitive dysfunctions apply first and foremost to issues related 
to racism (rather than every possible sort of belief), but given the role that race-­
based oppression plays in a wide variety of social contexts (e.g., housing, education, 
health care, criminal justice), these cognitive distortions can impede people’s under-
standings of a broad range of topics and issues and cut them off from a “verifiably 
accurate understanding of the world” (Thompson, 2013, 313).
These epistemic practices also contribute to subjective ignorance insofar as they 
render subjects deficient in critical thinking and self-awareness, prone to manipula-
tion, and largely incapable of the sort of integrative information processing that is 
needed in order to engage in complex moral reasoning. Instead, subjects become 
increasingly estranged from their own faculties of moral reasoning and exhibit a 
diminished capacity “to call into question the highly structured and unified norms 
and values that undergird institutions that promote domination and asymmetrical 
power structures” (Thompson, 2013, 316). That is, subjects not only are inculcated 
in pernicious epistemic practices, but also develop overly rigid habits of mind that 
render them less motivated or willing to detect errors and correct them (Alcoff, 
2007, 50). Along these lines, Alcoff (2007) points to “an atrophied ability to resist 
or critique” and a loss of critical rationality (53). Instead, subjects rely on intuitive 
forms of moral reasoning that they have developed through mimicry and social 
coordination, in the context of various social settings. Similarly, Thompson (2013) 
notes that “when our values are shaped by systems that are routinized and regular-
ized, embedded in the institutions that socialize us, individuals tend to take them on 
in such a way that they do not go through a process of internal, rational reflection” 
(313). They become less capable of considering external forms of information that 
are nonsynchronous with their habitual patterns of engagement and come to be 
governed by a set of norms, values, and interests that remain outside their reflective 
awareness.
Clearly, this sort of cognitive dysfunction (subjective ignorance) directly pro-
duces objective ignorance (involving lack of knowledge about specific information 
or inadequate understandings of the social world). Subjects increasingly tend to 
misconstrue their surroundings, remain unaware of their own biases, and operate 
according to false understandings. I have suggested that this tendency to become 
locked into patterns of ignorance (Alcoff, 2007, 56) can be understood as a matter 
M. Maiese

91
of becoming “stuck” in overly rigid habits of mind that lead to atrophied moral 
cognition (Thompson, 2013).
5.4  The Active Role of White Subjects
There is a worry that the account I have outlined thus far underemphasizes the 
agency of white people and neglects their investment in whiteness and the privileges 
it entails. Several theorists who have conceptualized the workings of racism and 
white supremacy in terms of habits may appear to hold that subjects are largely pas-
sive with respect to their own ignorance. If white ignorance is located in their 
unconscious habits and bodily constitution (Sullivan, 2014), does this mean that 
they are largely incapable of both behaving ethically and understanding themselves 
as unethical? Milazzo (2017) objects to Sullivan’s (2014) characterization of pre-
conscious or unconscious habits and the corresponding implication that white sub-
jects are fundamentally innocent. If we conceive of white people as being constituted 
by habits that are beyond their control and have been cultivated by a racist world 
that is external to them, then we neglect the central role played by individual inter-
ests in the reproduction of white privilege (Milazzo, 2017, 566).
As Mills readily acknowledges, white ignorance does not entail merely a lack of 
knowledge or a gap in information that might be eliminated by learning new facts 
(see also Pritchard, Chap. 4, this volume); it also involves the active production of 
particular kinds of knowledge that sustain specific social conditions. Along these 
lines, Medina maintains that “active ignorance” involves misrecognition and “occurs 
with the active participation of the subject” (2013, 39). Thus, I agree that it would 
be a mistake to “portray whites as ignorant puppets at the mercy of unconscious 
habits” (Milazzo, 2017, 567). However, it likewise would be a mistake to ignore the 
powerful social structures and normative practices that sustain racialized privilege 
and cultivate white ignorance. In fact, white ignorance is a valuable conceptual tool 
largely because it allows us to resolve the apparent contradiction between (i) white 
people’s “unknowing,” and (ii) their active interest in maintaining the racialized 
status quo (Moore, 2019, 263). While white ignorance may be actively maintained, 
this frequently is not the result of conscious intentions or deliberate choices. Rather 
than being overtly promoted or embraced by contemporary white subjects, white 
supremacy often is more subtly signaled and absorbed via social institutions that 
“seduce” them with various privileges (Noe, 2020, 289). In many cases, the social 
forces that help to mold and reproduce specific patterned behaviors (habits) operate 
in hegemonic ways that are largely routine and invisible (covert). Insofar as there 
are powerful social-structural forces that help to generate this stance of unknowing, 
white ignorance does not exist separately from the social context that helps to pro-
duce it. Thus, “white people are not necessarily consciously conspiring to maintain 
a façade of obliviousness” (Moore, 2019, 262).
And yet individuals may contribute to their own ignorance due to self-interested 
motives. Milazzo (2017) proposes that such motives center around power and 
5  Mindshaping, Racist Habits, and White Ignorance

92
holding onto material benefits associated with the structural advantages of white-
ness. Likewise, Mills (2007) notes that there is a vested white group interest in the 
racial status quo and that many whites see black interests as opposed to their own 
(35). Those who benefit from injustice often cannot or will not perceive it as such 
(Whitt, 2016, 432), since such acknowledgement would call for efforts that entail 
giving up these advantages. However, an explanation for people’s “possessive 
investment in whiteness” likely requires a consideration of additional motives. 
Extending the work of Mills, Beckles-Raymond (2020) proposes that it is not just 
“the self-­interested group desire to maintain and reproduce white supremacy that 
motivates white ignorance and institutional racism,” but also “the need to hold onto 
a conception of oneself as good” (176). This builds upon Mills’ description of white 
ignorance as psychologically and socially functional: it operates as a form of social 
amnesia that allows people to ignore their own implication in systems of privilege/
disadvantage and positions them as innocent. Insofar as the cognitive distortions 
that Mills describes posit whiteness-as-goodness, the unknowing that is at play in 
white ignorance allows subjects to hold onto their conception of themselves (and of 
whiteness) as good (Beckles-Raymond, 2020). This enables them to “live more 
comfortably among the horrors of white supremacy” and to enjoy the benefits of 
racial oppression while simultaneously believing sincerely that those benefits were 
earned fair and square (Glazer & Liebow, 2021, 51). Yet another central reason that 
habits become sedimented is that they enable someone “to find equilibrium within 
the surrounding environment” (MacMullan, 2009, 76), which is centrally a matter 
of gaining other people’s acceptance and approval. Challenging white normativity 
may very well result in being regarded with suspicion or dismissed as unreasonable 
(Bailey, 2007, 79) by members of one’s immediate social group, and thus is mal-
adaptive in some sense.
Enactivism rightly acknowledges that although social norms do regulate people’s 
behavior and define the meaning of what they do, their behavior is not fully deter-
mined by social norms or practices. What is more, the enactivist approach empha-
sizes that although these habits do become anchored in the body, people are 
sometimes able to change themselves and alter their habits (e.g., by joining 
consciousness-­raising groups or advocacy campaigns). Even though the habits asso-
ciated with white ignorance are unconscious in a reflective sense, there typically is 
some degree of pre-reflective awareness that can be made more explicit. Thus, even 
if it’s true that Mills’ nonracist cognizer has been subjected to institutional misedu-
cation, they are still partly responsible for whether they un-self-reflectively identify 
themselves as white (in opposition to those who are black) and how they locate 
themselves within racist social structures (Beckles-Raymond, 2020, 180). To say 
that habits frequently operate outside of subjects’ reflective awareness does not 
entail that they are situated completely outside their control. Instead, habits operate 
somewhere between (i) the controls of reason and practical deliberation, and (ii) the 
forces which bypass the reach of reasoning and deliberation (Matthews, 2017, 411). 
Habits are not random events, nor are they actions that an agent explicitly plans or 
intends to carry out. But because habits can be modified or eliminated via various 
efforts of the agent, subjects do “bear responsibility for outcomes that are produced 
M. Maiese

93
wholly or partly as a result of their exercise” (Matthews, 2017, 413). It is true that 
habits sometimes rigidify into ways of being that can be escaped only through sus-
tained effort; in the context of white ignorance and racist habits, subjects need to 
“do the work” that it takes to overcome their built-up patterns of behavior and atten-
tion and alter rigidly engrained habits. However, it would be a huge mistake to sup-
pose that once they become sedimented, habits are fixed and unchangeable; on the 
contrary, insofar as they are held in the body in a continuous and ongoing way, they 
are both active and continually activated (Ngo, 2016). Overcoming white ignorance 
may very well require that subjects become more attentive to the ways that they 
engage with their social environment, critically reflecting on their habits of behavior 
and attention and intentionally enacting new patterns of engagement.
In my view, the enactivist conception of mindshaping that I have outlined helps 
to bridge the gap between the socio-structural and psychological (individual) dimen-
sions of white ignorance. This is because my proposed mindshaping thesis says that 
the partial determination or shaping of our embodied minds is itself partially deter-
mined or shaped by means of self-reflexive feedback loops (Maiese & Hanna, 
2019). By highlighting the reciprocal feedback relations between individuals and 
social activity, enactivism emphasizes that the individual agent is not simply shaped, 
but also is an active shaper of both other people and her social environment. Through 
their unique contributions and active responses, individuals can influence the work-
ings of social institutions and succumb to or resist these socializing practices to 
varying degrees. Insofar as there is a transactional back-and-forth between individu-
als and the wider social world, “institutional habits and the habits of individuals are 
co-constitutive” (Noe, 2020, 299). This is because individuals and social groups are 
linked in what Protevi (2009) calls “mutual presupposition”: the behavior of indi-
viduals is “patterned by the social group to which they belong; and it is this very 
patterning [of individuals] that allows the functioning of the social group” (39). The 
actions of a single subject can have rippling effects on other individuals and the 
institutions in which she is embedded. For example, increased racial self-­
consciousness on the part of individual subjects can have a positive impact on public 
policy decisions and state governance, whereas compliance with white normativity 
simply reinforces and reinscribes the existing racial order. Higgins (2019) asks us to 
consider a subordinated immigrant within a xenophobic culture and observes that 
although she is molded by the culture’s ideological structures, she is not a mere ves-
sel for them; ideology and social expectations are not internalized wholesale. The 
way that she engages with these ideological structures, whether complying with or 
resisting them, makes a significant difference to her ongoing habit formation.
In short, because the reproduction of habits depends on a network of social inter-
actions, it is possible for people embedded in social institutions to shift their pat-
terns of engagement and cultivate new habits of mind, and for this to have not only 
a direct effect on their actions, but also a salient impact on other agents. When 
individuals make efforts to alter their habits of mind by seeking out new informa-
tion, endeavoring to improve their reasoning, and acknowledging that they have 
blind spots that need to be corrected, their modified patterns of meaning-making

contribute to a shift in the social environment that may help to alter the habits of 
those around them.
5.4.1  Case Study: Black Pete
To examine the workings of white ignorance and illustrate how the enactivist notions 
of mindshaping and habit can help to shed light on this phenomenon, I turn to 
Catala’s (2019) discussion of Black Pete as a case study. Catala points out that the 
year 2013 marked the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the former 
Dutch colonies of Suriname and the Dutch Antilles. In a letter to the Dutch govern-
ment in 2013, a group of experts from Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights 
Council pointed to Black Pete as a remnant of the colonial past and involvement in 
slavery and asserted that the portrayal of Black Pete perpetuated a negative stereo-
type and derogatory image of African peoples. The letter asked the government 
whether and how it is addressing such concerns. In response, the Dutch government 
stated that even though it is aware that some people consider Black Pete offensive, 
this is part of a traditional children’s festival. Catala notes that this response is in 
line with the view of most Dutch citizens (mostly white) who believe that: (a) it’s a 
tradition, (b) it’s about children and presents, and (c) it has nothing to do with rac-
ism. Black and white citizens who denounce these practices as racist have been met 
with disbelief, dismissal, insults, threats, and even physical violence. While some of 
these reactions display explicit racism and hostility, Catala acknowledges, others 
count as expressions of genuine puzzlement. Part of the explanation for why most 
white citizens in the Netherlands fail to see how Black Pete or performing in black-
face could be racist is that they believe that the Dutch are tolerant people, and toler-
ant people do not do racist things.
This seems to be a striking case in which white many subjects seem unable to 
understand a cultural practice that they themselves have created. Their ignorance or 
lack of understanding can be understood as a result of mindshaping that occurs via 
this cultural practice itself, as well as through other cultural symbols, political dis-
course, media portrayals, and established bodies of knowledge. From a young age, 
children are told that if they behave well, Saint Nicholas will bring them candy and 
presents; but if they behave badly, they will have to deal with St. Nick’s servant, 
Black Pete, who will punish them. Moreover, they encounter Black Pete as a buf-
foonish black man dressed in Renaissance page boy attire who appears clumsy and 
dumb and speaks in broken Dutch. They watch parades in which swarms of dancing 
Black Pete’s are played by whites in blackface makeup, and in their classrooms at 
school, they create cutouts and drawings of Black Pete for decoration. Via these 
various dimensions, children habitually come to view the associated stereotype as 
normal and inconsequential; this portrayal of Black Pete is socially expected, nor-
malized, and customary. Thus, partly by way of this very cultural practice, children 
develop a habit of viewing their social world in a particular way.
M. Maiese

The white ignorance at stake in the Black Pete case seems to be playing out at 
two related levels: (1) the level of cognitive dysfunction, and (2) the level of inac-
curate understandings generated by this cognitive dysfunction. Regarding (1), this 
case involves subjective ignorance, self-obviousness, and a lack of critical self-­
reflection. White subjects who defend the practice are stuck in ignorance partly 
because they rely on more intuitive forms of reasoning: rather than reflecting on the 
practice and more seriously engaging with the possibility that Black Pete is racist, 
many subjects react immediately, without stopping to reflect, and point to the prac-
tice’s status as “tradition” as justification for its continuance. Their patterns of inter-
pretation and assessment are relatively inflexible and not responsive to facts or 
evidence that counters the dominant view of the practice. In addition, as a cultural 
symbol, Black Pete involves a narrow, analytic conceptualization or categorization 
that casts nonwhite Others as lesser beings. That is, the portrayal of Black Pete as a 
servant who is dumb and clumsy clearly invokes racial stereotypes. This cultural 
symbol and its associated presuppositions likely draw people’s thinking in a par-
ticular direction, constrain how they make sense of things, and normalize an assump-
tion of innate Black inferiority. That is, Black Pete contributes to the process 
whereby children in the twenty-first century are mindshaped in accordance with 
“white normativity.” Moreover, those who insist that Black Pete is not racist seem 
to be relying on a diffuse style of thinking whereby they are unable to see the inter-
relationships between the contemporary portrayal of Black Pete and the colonial 
history of racism. Their perception of Black Pete, as Catala notes, is dehistoricized, 
and they operate with a more fragmented, incomplete view of the social world. They 
also are unable to reflect on how their own cognitive-epistemic processes have been 
impacted by this cultural symbol (together with a broader array of social practices), 
and seemingly unprepared to question their engrained assumptions. As a result, 
their perception of Black Pete (as nonracist) seems self-evident and naturally cor-
rect, and any suggestion that Black Pete is racist will be met with puzzlement or 
defensiveness.
Subjects who suffer from a kind of blindness or unknowing with respect to Black 
Pete have been socially inculcated and “mindshaped” in overdetermining ways by 
prevailing social norms and expectations. Thus, we cannot understand their igno-
rance without examining the broader social-structural factors that help to generate 
and sustain it. However, individual white subjects also play an active role in sustain-
ing their own ignorance via their attachment to customary practices and their need 
to hold onto a conception of themselves as “tolerant” and therefore not guilty of 
racism. They have an interest in continuing to enact the habits of mind associated 
with white ignorance, since this allows them to conceive of themselves as innocent 
and good and frees them from the need to question their own race-based material 
advantages. This subjective ignorance centrally involves faulty cognitive-epistemic 
modes of engagement, which I have conceptualized in terms of inflexible habits of 
mind that impede self-interrogation and critical engagement. Such subjective igno-
rance, in turn, produces ignorance in the form of inadequate understandings of the 
social world, namely, a misunderstanding about the cultural significance of Black

Pete and a lack of awareness of how the Netherlands’ colonial history continues to 
impact the present.
5.5  Conclusion
White ignorance centrally involves overly rigid habits of mind that lead subjects to 
disregard certain areas of experience, inquiry, and testimony; discount relevant 
information; and overlook salient considerations. Subjects habitually engage in dis-
tancing, frequently fail to connect the dots or draw connections, and are suspicious 
of information that casts doubt on white normativity or innocence. Subjects may 
form routine assumptions about white superiority or authority and exhibit a ten-
dency to invalidate or distrust the testimony of people of color or to assume that 
expressions of anger are an overreaction. Such habits contribute to atrophied moral 
cognition and render subjects unable to appreciate the conditions of their own privi-
lege or consider how their own positive biases (toward whiteness) or negative biases 
(toward blackness or brownness) impact their patterns of behavior and attention. In 
this sense, white ignorance is double ignorance: many white subjects not only are 
ignorant of important facts and considerations related to persistent racism, but also 
ignorant of their own ignorance (Glazer & Liebow, 2021, 50).
My proposed enactivist account of habits and mindshaping helps to explain why 
people participate so naturally in oppressive patterns of thought and action (habits) 
and why white ignorance is so difficult to overcome. Once particular patterns of 
behavior and attention become habitual, they are engrained in the living bodies and 
neurobiological dynamics of the participants; they thereby become “second nature” 
and operate as a matter of common sense. In addition, enactivism helps to make 
sense of how white ignorance is both a structural/institutional problem, and also a 
problem at the level of individual habits and enactments. First, the institutional fac-
tors that help to cultivate white ignorance exist before an individual comes on the 
scene and thus are beyond her control in some sense. However, although they are 
external in some sense, these structures and practices also are internalized (in the 
form of bodily habits) and go on to structure interactions between individuals. 
Embodied-enactive principles emphasize that human agents are not passive subjects 
molded by their social world; rather, they enact meaning via their embodied engage-
ment, and the meanings that they enact feed back into the social world. Thus, sec-
ond, it is partly up to individuals to push back against their own ignorance and 
cultivate new habits by listening to the testimony of people of color, reading books 
that expose them to untold history or nondominant perspectives, reckoning with 
their investment in white privilege and complicity in racist social structures, and 
taking steps to actively resist these structures. However, these concluding remarks 
provide only a sketch; further work should be done to investigate how to transform 
the habits of mind that comprise white ignorance.

Ignorance and (Im)Possibility
Vlad P. Glăveanu
Abstract  This chapter is dedicated to an exploration of the connections between 
ignorance, possibility, and impossibility. While traditionally studies of ignorance 
have been firmly anchored in debates about knowledge (and the lack of knowledge), 
what I propose here is that this phenomenon is (also) essential for our engagement 
with the possible. The sociocultural theory of the possible claims that possibility 
emerges at the intersection between multiple perspectives that, in turn, build on dif-
ferences of position within a shared social, material, cultural, and psychological 
space. Conversely, the impossible is concerned less with what cannot be actualized 
as much as with the singularity of perspectives and the negation of difference. The 
argument I develop is that ignorance plays a key role in both the dynamic of possi-
bility and impossibility. More concretely, ignorance can keep us away from recog-
nizing and embracing other perspectives, while it can also make us humble and 
curious about those perspectives and positions in the world that are inaccessible to 
us. I will take the case of the perspective of others, especially migrants and refugees, 
to illustrate a small typology including: default ignorance or the state of not being 
aware, on a daily basis, of perspectives different than our own; deliberate ignorance 
or the conscious decision not to engage with the perspective of specific others; 
masked ignorance or the assumption of understanding a perspective one has no 
understanding of; and wondrous ignorance or a state of complete openness to new 
perspective without the expectation of final or certain knowledge. In the end, the 
embodied and distributed nature of each of these forms of ignorance will be dis-
cussed in light of how they contribute to the (im)possibility of an authentic engage-
ment with others and otherness.

6.1  Introduction
The dictionary definition of ignorance ties it closely to knowledge, specifically its 
absence. To be ignorant means not to know or not to be aware of something.1 With 
this definition comes a generally negative list of associations for those who are 
ignorant and who, as a consequence, get depicted as uneducated, inexperienced, 
ill-­mannered, unsophisticated, even stupid or brutish. This is how, in everyday lan-
guage at least, calling someone ignorant is an insult or an accusation. It means 
positioning them as inferior – lacking knowledge – and ultimately bad – resisting 
the acquisition of knowledge. While the term itself is rarely used in psychology, 
there is a long tradition in this discipline of valuing knowledge over not knowing 
and especially focusing on errors and biases that corrupt knowledge and lead us to 
being wrong, misinformed, ignorant (Gigerenzer & Selten, 2002; Tversky & 
Kahneman, 1974). And yet, this has not always been the case. In fact, the Socratic 
roots of philosophy take us to a more positive relation between knowing and not 
knowing, between ignorance and wisdom. For Socrates himself, admitting one’s 
lack of knowledge was the first step on the path to a deeper understanding of things 
(Lesher, 1987). An attitude of intellectual humility, one that includes the recognition 
of ignorance, was seen as much more productive for deeper intellectual pursuits. In 
the end, not knowing does not deny the willingness to know and the very awareness 
of ignorance can be the engine for new questions, wonderings, and possibilities.
This is what this chapter aims to unpack: the relationship between ignorance and 
the possible. It is perhaps a curious connection, one that breaks away from the old-­
age relation to knowledge and moves us past simplistic, negative associations. More 
than this, it opens up a new horizon of understanding ignorance as state of mind or 
attitude that can welcome new possibilities. This is not an overly romanticized 
account, however. More ignorance doesn’t automatically translate into more possi-
bility. In fact, as we shall see, specific ways of being ignorant set up various kinds 
of impossibility in our relation to ourselves, to others, and to the world. And yet, 
there is something intrinsically valuable in not knowing, in not having made up 
one’s mind, in being open to new and different knowledge – a condition of possibil-
ity for the possible itself. The crux of the argument developed in this chapter goes 
something like this: The possible relies on the existence of multiple perspectives 
and their recognition. One can be ignorant in terms of the former or the latter (and, 
on some occasions, of both). Not knowing exactly what perspectives can be gener-
ated but recognizing the value of generating them is a possibility-enabling kind of 
ignorance. Resisting new perspectives and not appreciating their importance is an 
impossibility-enabling ignorance. In this chapter, I will take the case of our relation 
to migration and the perspectives of migrants to illustrate one type of 
possibility-­enabling ignorance  – wondrous  – and three types that are closer to 
impossibility-­enabling ignorance – default, deliberate, and masked. While the last

101
three are certainly common and more differentiated, I will argue in the end that 
wondrous ignorance is fundamental not only for our sense of possibility but also for 
our shared humanity.
The chapter starts with a general discussion of the notion of possibility and, more 
specifically, outlines a pragmatist, sociocultural account of both the possible rooted 
in the notions of difference, position, perspective, and dialogue. At the heart of this 
account, we find the idea that possibility depends on the diversity of perspectives, 
and these, in turn, depend on openness to difference (Glăveanu, 2020a). It will be 
argued that certain forms of ignorance capture precisely this openness to what is and 
to what is to come. At the same time, disregarding or radically opposing differences 
of perspective can also relate to ignorance; in these cases, an ignorance that rejects 
rather than embraces otherness, possibility, and an open future. The case of migra-
tion will be discussed with examples from social media studies of how the perspec-
tives of migrants and refugees are represented (or not) in online spaces. This case 
will be used to document a typology of ignorance that includes default, deliberate, 
masked, and wondrous forms, each one with its own set of characteristics and prac-
tical consequences. In the end, a distributed account of ignorance is outlined, one 
that moves it from stable forms and categories to the interactive and shifting spaces 
of dialogue between self and other, self and objects, self and society. It is here, at the 
encounter with the world, especially the world of others, that ignorance can help us 
unleash the possible, if we allow it to.
6.2  The Possible, the Impossible, and the Ignorant
Before understanding the role of ignorance in relation to (im)possibility, we need to 
delve deeper into the possible, a notion with deep historical roots that spans centu-
ries of reflection in philosophy and the humanities (Khemlani et al., 2018; Nolan, 
2013; Ronen, 1994) and has more recently become important for the social sciences 
and psychology (Glăveanu, 2018; Mills, 2000; Poli, 2017; Seligman et al., 2016), 
including neuroscience (Abraham, 2018). In lay terms, the possible refers to some-
thing that is within the limits of one’s ability to accomplish, something that can be 
conceived or done, or something that may or may not happen.2 In other words, it 
resides in the person’s understanding of himself or herself or of the situation – imag-
ining what can exist or not, what can be done, what is, in the end, imaginable. This 
stands in contrast, in many ways, to etymological meanings where the Latin possi-
bilis meant “that can be done” and related to the root posse “be able”.3 As such, 
there is a closer connection established here between possibility and action as a way 
of turning the possible into the actual and, in and through this process of

actualization, opening up new horizons of possibility. The possible involves not 
only thinking but acting in and on the world in order to test and expand the limits of 
what is doable, thinkable, and of different ways of being.
This close connection between possibility and action is built upon in sociocul-
tural theory and especially a sociocultural approach that follows pragmatist princi-
ples (Glăveanu, 2020a). From this standpoint, our awareness and exploration of 
possibilities are always anchored by our positioning in the world. This positioning 
takes many forms. We can think about physical positioning defined as where the 
person exists in space, or social positioning, defined in terms of the roles he or she 
is playing. There are also more symbolic forms of positioning that can be found in 
discourse and in the way people are categorized and referred to (for more details, 
see positioning theory; Harré et al., 2009). Importantly, human beings are always 
positioned at once in physical, social, and symbolic terms in the sense that we can-
not escape the embodied, sociocultural framing of our actions and interactions (even 
if, sometimes, one type of positioning comes to the fore and places the others in the 
background). Another important observation is that, from the different positions we 
occupy, we develop specific relations to the world. These, following pragmatist 
scholarship, can be theorized as perspectives or action orientations that guide our 
thinking, emotional reactions, and behavior (Gillespie, 2006; Martin, 2006). For 
example, from the physical position of being at the back of the class, one develops 
a given visual perspective that is different than that of people seated in front. The 
social position (role) of a student will lead to different perspectives or orientations, 
within a classroom, than that of a teacher (and no two teachers and students carry 
exactly the same perspective). Given that each one of these perspectives “con-
structs” the world for us in a specific way (in terms of what would, could, and 
should do; Glăveanu, 2016), our sphere of possibilities is both enabled and con-
strained by the positions we occupy and the perspectives we adopt. Being “trapped” 
within singular positions and perspectives is certainly highly constraining for how 
we see and approach any situation. Fortunately, the human condition is such that we 
always have alternative positions to inhabit and alternative perspectives to develop. 
This is not only because of the fact, noted before, that our positioning in the world 
is intrinsically multilayered (and, as such, our perspectives on self and world are 
always plural), but because we can also move between positions and switch per-
spectives (for more details, see Position Exchange Theory; Gillespie & Martin, 
2014). Continuing our example, those at the back of the class can move in front – 
and sometimes, they are explicitly asked to do so by the teacher – or the other way 
around. Also, students can temporarily occupy the role of the teacher when making 
presentations and are supposed to instruct their colleagues; equally, teachers can 
find themselves in the position of a student at work – perhaps in front of their supe-
riors – or in another context – for example, when attending a cooking class.
Is it enough though to have a diversity of positions and perspectives available in 
order to become aware of and, especially, to explore multiple possibilities? 
Unfortunately, no. Differences of position and perspective are a necessary but not 
sufficient condition for engaging with the possible. This is because (and we shall 
explore this point at length in the chapter) differences, whether they refer to one’s

physical or social characteristics or one’s point of view, can easily fail to be notice-
able, especially if we want to conserve the illusion that most people think like us or 
believe in the things we believe in (see the false consensus effect; Marks & Miller, 
1987). Second, even if we are aware of the difference, we might choose to either 
ignore it or downplay it. In the end, it is more comfortable to assume consensus than 
to go into the details of why we differ from others (e.g., Krueger, 1998). Finally, 
even when differences in perspective are properly acknowledged, it doesn’t mean 
that the person will necessarily use them to gain new insights or learn from them. 
Coming back to the example of classrooms, the teacher can ask a question that gen-
erates multiple answers from students (reflecting, among others, their perspectives). 
The teacher has a specific answer in mind that he or she would like to highlight, so 
while recognizing that some students think differently, the teacher might just decide 
to elaborate on one answer and close down the possibilities of understanding the 
problem differently provided by other points of view (a dynamic that is often found 
in school whenever teachers act to reduce uncertainty; Beghetto, 2017).
The key to unlocking the possible rests in establishing a dialogue between per-
spectives in which (a) we understand our own position and perspective as one 
among many and (b) we act on the difference presented to us by this multiplicity in 
ways that integrate and/or diversify perspectives. In other words, differences are not 
only recognized but used to generate new meanings about self, others, and world. In 
this context, the opposite of the possible has less to do with the absence of opportu-
nities to act (which is a lay understanding of the term) and more to do with the 
absence of dialogue. Seen through the prism of dialogism (Bakhtin, 1981), dia-
logues are always emergent essentially because they keep perspectives in tension 
and avoid the easy resolution of difference. The possible dwells in dialogical ten-
sion more than it does in fleeing novel thoughts and actions. The monological domi-
nance of a single perspective, at the expense of all others, closes down possibilities 
by not being able to escape singular relations to and understandings of the world 
(Nesari, 2015). Of course, this doesn’t mean that a hyper-plurality of perspectives is 
always needed; in fact, contemplating too many points of view at once can be dis-
orienting or disengaging. It can dissuade people from acting as, often, the moment 
of action is monological in its enactment of a specific perspective or orientation. 
But, at the same time, we depend on the multiplicity of perspectives for some of the 
phenomena considered eminently human; e.g., agency, imagination, and, indeed, 
possibility. In short, to become aware of and explore the possible, we need to (1) be 
aware of differences of position and perspective; (2) value such differences and the 
perspectival dialogues they ensue; and (3) act on the difference in ways that either 
integrate or diversify the range of perspectives we have at our disposal (something 
that characterizes a relationship to the world marked by “openness to difference”; 
for details, see Glăveanu & Beghetto, 2017).
What does ignorance have to do with this dynamic? My proposal is that it plays 
a key double role when it comes to our awareness and exploration of the possible. 
On the one hand, ignorance of other perspectives and the lack of a desire to know or 
engage with them amounts to a reduction of possibility. The ignorance that sepa-
rates us from others, closing down opportunities for communication and mutual 
6  Ignorance and (Im)Possibility

104
understanding, presents us with the impossibility of decentering oneself from one’s 
own position. This kind of “position fixity” reduces the range of perspectives one 
can envision or draw upon in relating to self, others, and world. Either accidental or 
voluntary, this type of ignorance restricts one’s mental universe and, with it, one’s 
universe of action. By reducing differences, it reduces the chances for creative, new 
insights to emerge (something demonstrated also empirically by studies that com-
pare the creative performance of homogenous and heterogeneous groups; Triandis 
et al., 1965) and stifles the imagination (according to Vygotsky’s first law of the 
imagination, this phenomenon depends on the wealth of life experience accumu-
lated by the person in interaction with others and with culture; Vygotsky, 2004). 
This kind of ignorance can be generalized, when the person is unaware of or resis-
tant to the perspective of almost everyone else, or, in most cases, reduced to being 
ignorant about a specific number of individuals or groups. Typically, we are at risk 
of displaying such attitudes toward people or communities that are marginalized or 
oppressed. Historically, these have been represented by minorities or by discrimina-
tion based on gender, race, socioeconomic status, etc. While it might be argued that 
a “narrow” or targeted ignorance is better than a generalized state, we should 
remember that engaging with radically different perspectives can unlock more pos-
sibilities than interacting with different yet “close” positions and perspectives. This 
is, after all, the challenge presented to us by otherness, a notion often used to desig-
nate radical difference and the ways in which this difference is either ignored or 
“domesticated” by labelling it as wrong, inferior, exotic, etc. (see, for instance, the 
case of orientalism; Said, 1978). In either form, this type of ignorance enhances the 
sphere of impossibility rather than that of possibility, primarily the impossibility of 
imagining another world or the world as imagined by another.
Yet there is a side to ignorance that doesn’t only contribute to the expansion of 
possibility but is its actual precondition. In perspectival dialogues, whether taking 
place between people or within one’s inner dialogicality (Aveling et al., 2015), one 
of the big challenges is that certain perspectives carry more weight than others. This 
is, in many ways, unavoidable, given the fact that both positions and perspectives 
exist in fields of power (Foucault, 2019) and are attached to various types of capital 
(Bourdieu, 1987). As such, dialogues of perspectives are often unequal and set for 
predetermined conclusions. In order to diminish this effect, we need to consider 
each perspective with a degree of openness and humility that (only) wonder and 
ignorance can provide. Recognizing one’s lack of knowledge or understanding, 
especially when it comes to the logic behind someone else’s perspective, position, 
or life experience, is an essential part of ensuring such openness. Bracketing one’s 
assumptions and preconceived ideas is needed, and both are equally effortful. In 
these cases, ignorance is not the attitude of someone who lazily wants to avoid being 
bothered by the burden of thinking about the world from the standpoint of another. 
On the contrary, it means adopting, at times, the painfully difficult position of rec-
ognizing one’s limits and biases in the process of reaching out to others, not separat-
ing from them. It is the mark of what I called elsewhere alocentrism (Glăveanu, 
2019), an approach in which the strangeness of the other is not assimilated by the 
perceiving self through identification but remains a source of dialogical tension and

learning. It is no accident that wonder is mentioned in this context. As a principal 
pathway to the possible (Glăveanu, 2020b; Parsons, 1969), wondering implies the 
questioning of taken-for-granted perspectives, a defamiliarization of the familiar, a 
kind of “dwelling in the unknown” (Heidegger, 2002). And what unknown is there 
that is greater than that of the other, with his, her or their experience, beliefs, and 
lifeworld? Is there anything more complex we can wonder about than the people 
who are around us, anything we should more readily declare ourselves ignorant of? 
What about those we truly know less about and are separated from by tangible (e.g., 
distance) or intangible (e.g., prejudice) barriers? What kind of ignorance will we 
claim then and what consequences will this choice carry for our sense of possibility 
and for our shared humanity?
6.3  Migration, (Im)Possibility and Ignorance
In order to illustrate the different claims and typologies above, I want to focus on the 
case of migration and, in particular, the situation of refugees. This context offers a 
rich exemplification of possibilities and impossibilities embedded in the field of 
positions, perspectives, and power relations. The position and perspective of the 
refugee are especially interesting to consider given that people are positioned by 
others as refugees (or refused the claim to this kind of positioning) and their per-
spective is most of the time constructed by others (especially those in host societies) 
rather than agentically chosen by those who experience forced migration. In addi-
tion, we need to place these issues in the context of mobility and of understanding 
how the movements of people, goods, and ideas continue to transform today’s soci-
eties. The paradigm of “new mobilities” offers a unique vantage point from which 
to consider this dynamic given the emphasis placed on processes and flows rather 
than reified and static categories (Sheller & Urry, 2006; Urry, 2016). What is even 
more interesting for our discussion here is the articulation between mobility and 
human possibility (Glăveanu, 2020c). There is an intrinsic connection between 
movement and the (im)possible given the fact that movement itself involves reposi-
tioning and, as a consequence, the possibility of developing new perspectives on 
self and world. Acts of mobility, including migration, tend to be useful when it 
comes to opening new horizons of understanding and possibility for those who 
achieve them. There are numerous empirical examples, for instance, of how mobil-
ity supports students and teachers, businesses and employees, and communities at 
large (Jensen et al., 2018). This is because mobility not only helps individuals and 
groups encounter diversity, it also increases the “inner” diversity of perspectives 
acquired through repositioning. Importantly, though, there is no linear relation 
between mobility and possibility. Engaging in more mobility, for example, travel-
ling more, doesn’t automatically increase the creative agency of the person. As the 
case of forced migration and refugees comes to show, there are types of mobility 
that raise a range of impossibilities – the impossibility to stay, to continue one’s job, 
to obtain a new job, to integrate in the new society, to return to the old one, and so 
6  Ignorance and (Im)Possibility

106
on. Possibility-enhancing mobilities are those where changes of position are, at 
least to some extent, chosen, and the perspectives resulting from them are placed in 
dialogical relations. In other words, instead of the monological dominance of singu-
lar perspectives (e.g., the imposition of views and practices from specific groups in 
the host society), we should strive to allow for dialogical tensions between perspec-
tives (e.g., those of migrants and locals) in which each position is treated as valuable 
and engaged with on ethical terms. This, sadly, is far from the experience of migra-
tion of many people around the world.
My own research interest has focused on social representations of migrants and 
refugees in online spaces and particularly on the ways in which the perspective of 
migrants is being constructed on social media. Together with collaborators, I have 
examined this topic in relation to both internet memes and forum comments on 
platforms such as Reddit and Twitter (e.g., Glăveanu et al., 2018; de Saint Laurent 
et al., 2020). In these different studies, we documented the particular ways in which 
migrants and refugees especially are being positioned by others, not through their 
own choice or volition. These types of positioning are often paradoxical, bringing 
together aspects that oppose each other. For example, online memes and comments 
tended to alternate between four main dichotomies: aggressors versus victims, 
worthless versus valuable, unethical versus ethical, and unable versus able to inte-
grate. In each of these instances, refugees are depicted either as agentic (able to take 
swift aggressive or unethical action) or powerless (victims who bring nothing of 
value to society). They seemingly can, for instance, orchestrate terror attacks or take 
the jobs of locals while, at the same time, being unable to fend for themselves, 
unwilling to work, and migrating for state benefits. This kind of positioning is not 
only inconsistent but disempowering for migrants (and disadvantageous for those 
who persecute them and cannot seem to escape their preconceived ideas). Following 
what for many are highly dangerous acts of mobility – sometimes through forced 
displacement – the prospect of starting a new life elsewhere is fraught with impos-
sibilities. Key among them is the basic impossibility of having one’s own perspec-
tive heard, understood, or respected. While there are some dedicated online forums 
that actively seek and include migrant voices, the communities we studied primarily 
referred to migrants and refugees “in their absence,” as objects and not subjects of 
representation.
And this is where we encounter a first dimension of ignorance in online spaces – 
the lack of knowledge and lack of interest to acquire knowledge about the actual life 
experience of refugees. The absence of the refugee perspective in online forums, at 
least the ones we studied, is symptomatic of a wider issue, which is the reduced 
horizon of possibility for many migrants and refugees. Mobility, in this case, does 
not lead to the agentic choice of new positions and roles but to being placed in posi-
tions and roles that afford no more forward movement, which are essentially static. 
This is what many refugees and asylum seekers especially experience as “being 
stuck,” an emotional state that combines the hope for a better future with the frustra-
tion of not being able to reach that future. An analysis of the emotions associated 
with the nexus between mobility and possibility (for details, see Glăveanu & 
Womersley, 2021) reveals a complex picture of opposing states of mind and 
V. P. Glăveanu

107
divergent drives. Longing for home stands side by side with a desire to build a new 
life, melancholy for the past is associated with the expectation for a different future, 
newly found feelings of safety coexist with the anxiety of being “trapped” in a place 
and position one has not chosen (or, at least, not freely). Migrants and refugees are 
often ignorant about the future in the sense that they cannot foresee what will hap-
pen next and, in some cases, have given up on trying to anticipate. Immobility – at 
different scales, personal, social, economic, etc. – breeds impossibility and despair, 
and these, in turn, lead to an ignorance that serves almost as a defense mechanism: 
not wanting to know what will come as a way of protecting oneself from deciding 
what to do about it.
Of course, such complexities rarely feature within online discussions about 
migrants and refugees where there often is little room for empathy and where pro-
cesses of perspective-taking take various forms. Perspective-taking is an intrinsi-
cally interesting notion for scholars of mobility, possibility, and ignorance alike. For 
mobility and migration researchers, it brings to the fore the psychological dynamics 
between migrants and the host population and the assumptions made by each when 
it comes to the expectations, thoughts, feelings, and motives of the other. For pos-
sibility scholars, the ability to engage with the (real or imagined) perspectives of 
other people opens up new horizons for understanding self and world sometimes in 
new and surprising ways. For those interested in ignorance, the way in which per-
spectives are constructed, recognized, or rejected gives a unique insight into what 
we are ignorant of, or prefer to be ignorant of, when it comes to others.
In the end, as discussed in previous work (Glăveanu & de Saint Laurent, 2018), 
processes of perspective-taking reflect different kinds of commitment on the part of 
those who attempt to understand the views and lifeworld of others. To simplify 
things, one can have a commitment to difference, in which the positions of self and 
other are kept separate and an insurmountable gap is placed between their experi-
ences. In these cases, perspectives are constructed “from the outside,” oftentimes 
based on stereotypes and even prejudice. Other times, the commitment to sameness 
prevails and intersubjective bridges are built between the two positions, “from 
within.” Here we can understand the position and perspective of another person 
because we recognize ourselves within it. The first case is captured by what we 
called essentialism and situationalism, in which perspectives are attributed based on 
assumptions about “how these people are” (essentialism) and “how people in this 
situation are” (situationalism), respectively. The second case is represented by repo-
sitioning (“If this happened to me”) and identification (“If I were him or her”), in 
many ways more emblematic processes for what we usually understand by 
perspective-­taking. Which doesn’t mean that identification, for instance, will lead to 
more positive attitudes toward the other and a greater impulse to help than, let’s say, 
situationalism. One can imagine a context in which the person doesn’t know him or 
herself well and, when imagining what they would do in a concrete situation (e.g., 
a situation of war), he or she ends up defending implausible courses of action (e.g., 
“If it was me, I wouldn’t run away but stay and fight”). Other times, thinking about 
how context – social, economic, political, religious – shapes others and how harsh 
living conditions can lead them to desperate actions (including migration) could

inspire the need to help (oftentimes from a paternalistic position). Ignorance vis a 
vis the actual perspective of the other – in our case a migrant or refugee – is being 
bridged, then, by imagining his or her perspective from an “outside” or “inside” 
position. The former denies us the possibility of using our own life experience to 
understand another person, for as different as this person might be from us. The lat-
ter risks misunderstanding the other by being ignorant about oneself. And then there 
is another way, one in which ignorance makes us wonder about the other and, by 
extension, the self. This move doesn’t separate or dissolve the self into the other but 
places them into an emergent, even if sometimes tense, dialogue. How do these 
“versions” of ignorance become manifest, why and with what consequences? This 
is discussed and exemplified as follows.
6.3.1  Default Ignorance
Default ignorance designates those cases in which the person is not aware of per-
spectives different than his or her own. This is, in many ways, an adaptive state of 
mind since oftentimes we can be overwhelmed by thinking about different and 
especially competing perspectives or courses of action. It is cognitively economical 
(Rescher, 1989) to zoom in on single ways of thinking or doing things rather than 
ponder extensively over alternatives. This eases our thinking processes and facili-
tates action. Indeed, the moment of action is often one of convergence and of choos-
ing one view over all others. Being ignorant of or discounting alternatives can be 
useful in this regard. This was, after all, one of the key accusations against Socrates 
and his methods for educating Athenian youth (Gill, 1973). By helping them fight 
against (default) ignorance and question their own perspectives and ways of under-
standing the world, Socrates cultivated more complex, wise thought. But he also 
made some of his students undecisive in a society that praised practical action and 
democratic participation. While this societal organization certainly pushed back 
against ignorance by educating its citizens (a case in point being Socrates’ own 
activity), it also appreciated determination and, as such, saw accepting ignorance as 
important as long as it didn’t interfere with decision making. There is, perhaps, an 
optimum to be found between a state of generalized, default ignorance and being 
able to ignore specific points of view, but the case remains that default ignorance has 
a part to play in society. Its shortcomings are exposed though whenever we end up 
ignoring useful perspectives because we are either not motivated or have no time to 
engage with them (requirements for passing from automatic to controlled forms of 
thinking; Devine, 1989).
In the context of migration, default ignorance is most often harmful. It captures 
a state in which the host population or migrants themselves are unaware of the 
views, needs, or desires of others. Unlike the case of deliberate ignorance, to be 
discussed next, default ignorance is a marker here of the fact that locals or migrants 
don’t have enough opportunities to meet each other, exchange perspectives, or be in 
the position of the other. This is common in those countries in which the migration

policy, especially for refugees coming in, is to isolate them in communities that are 
heavily guarded until their applications are eventually processed. Such separation is 
counterproductive for the mental health and well-being of those who seek asylum 
(e.g., Tribe, 2002) and it also fosters an unwilling ignorance of the other and the 
situation of the other, particularly within the host society.
In the social media studies referred to before, default ignorance is exemplified by 
the fact that, even in discussions about the perspectives of migrants and refugees, 
there are rare instances of actually referring to interactions and genuine exchanges. 
It is accepted that migrants and refugees are to be talked about but not to be talked 
to (and, even more, listened to). There is a vacuum of representation in online spaces 
and in society when it comes to refugee voices (Alhayek, 2014; Cabot, 2016), one 
that fosters disengagement, prejudice (on both sides), and the feeling of powerless-
ness (especially on the side of migrants). Such states of default ignorance are also 
what some politicians build upon to foster hatred and discrimination by demonizing 
migrants and their arrival. Analogies are frequently made in these cases to the idea 
of an “invading army” or of a “disease” that is spreading from one part of the world 
to another (e.g., El Refaie, 2001). Such demeaning discourses build on the willing 
or unwilling ignorance of those who never stop to consider the life of migrants and 
refugees or to take their perspective. In terms of the two processes of taking per-
spectives, from the “outside” or “inside,” default ignorance doesn’t follow a pre-
ferred path as it designates the absence of perspective-taking altogether. In this 
sense, this kind of ignorance is the antithesis of possibility given that it doesn’t 
allow for multiple perspectives and, therefore, for dialogue. It is also a sign of per-
sonal, especially psychological, immobility. The person who embraces default 
ignorance doesn’t get to experience multiple positions and, in doing so, to expand 
his or her perspectives on and experiences of the world. Default ignorance might 
sometimes help us take practical, decisive action, but it does little for establishing 
mutual understanding between self and other, particularly when the other is seen as 
radically different. Processes of othering thrive on the background of default igno-
rance (Canales, 2000).
6.3.2  Deliberate Ignorance
As mentioned above, default ignorance is largely unintentional. We grow into the 
habit of ignoring specific people and perspectives so much so that we don’t do it 
deliberately; we are so overwhelmed by events that we have no time to think about 
things more deeply. But there is also ignorance as a conscious decision not to take 
or engage with the perspective of others (what Gigerenzer & Garcia-Retamero, 
2017, call willful ignorance; see also Tuana, 2006). This deliberate ignorance 
extends to those we view negatively or generally disconsider. It is a phenomenon 
that oftentimes reflects power relations within society as we are likely to be deliber-
ately ignorant of the perspective of people who are marginalized or oppressed. This 
kind of ignorance makes others “invisible” to the self, and, as such, it has 
6  Ignorance and (Im)Possibility

110
pronounced consequences for how we relate to them and understand the world 
around us. Deliberate ignorance can also be used as a way of protecting oneself 
from harmful views or types of knowledge. If the views of the other are negative, 
then it helps to find excuses for not really engaging with them. In these cases, a dose 
of deliberate ignorance can maintain one’s self-esteem (Blaine & Crocker, 1993) 
and even reflect one’s agency in dealing with difficult situations. Of course, the risk 
is that of entering a spiraling interplay of ignorance in which both parts avoid rec-
ognizing each other’s perspectives and contest their validity. In such situations, 
communication and mutual understanding are severely curtailed.
Connecting deliberate ignorance back to the issue of possibility, it is clear that, 
in most cases, possibilities are being restricted by this refusal to know or to under-
stand. Perspectives that would otherwise enrich one’s own universe and worldview 
are rejected and, at the same time, the refusal of dialogue is enforced. Of course, 
things are not always so clear-cut. As alluded to above, the act of deliberately choos-
ing to ignore specific people, situations, or events can be a sign of empowerment 
and a self-protective measure. It can be a choice made, in fact, after prologued 
deliberation and, as such, be the opposite of default ignorance. In fact, a clear dif-
ference between the two has to do less with intentionality (or lack of) and more with 
the fact that deliberate ignorance does recognize the fact that specific perspectives 
are to be rejected and, as such, implicitly recognizes their existence. In terms of 
possibility, this means that perspectives are not overlooked as much as blocked and 
this leaves its mark on the external and internal dialogues that concern those per-
spectives. It also means that, in time, it is easier to move from deliberate ignorance 
to recognition than it is from default ignorance to recognition. At the same time, 
deliberate forms of ignorance can be reinforced by negative encounters and can 
solidify over time.
In the context of mobility, deliberate ignorance closes us off from experiencing 
different positions in the world and from communicating with those who do. It 
keeps us separate from others and protects us from their “influence.” In practice, it 
is often associated with the rejection of migrants and refugees based on the assump-
tion of insurmountable differences, of radical otherness that cannot and should not 
be bridged. This is why most of the time deliberate ignorance is reflected by 
perspective-­taking from an “outside” position and, in particular, by the use of essen-
tialism and situationism. In the studies we conducted on social media, the use of 
these strategies generally led to disengagement: The others (in this case, refugees 
coming from Syria and other war-torn countries) were depicted as violent, indoctri-
nated, unethical, uncapable of changing. Entering this “moral bubble” (see Arfini & 
Bertolotti, 2019) closes down possibilities of understanding a refugee’s point of 
view beyond negative stereotypes and, in some cases, strong prejudices (Ahmed 
et al., 2021). Deliberate forms of ignorance have, in this case, a substantial impact 
on the self, not only self – other relations. Choosing not to know about the life of 
other people reduces one’s knowledge about the self given that we emerge as human 
selves precisely through acts of self-reflection and perspective-taking (see Mead, 
1934). Of course, it could be argued that people can choose to be deliberately igno-
rant vis-a-vis a specific group and not others and so that they never fully stop

111
practicing adopting various positions and perspectives through their development. 
And yet, systematically rejecting a person or group will necessarily leave its mark 
on one’s level of participation in social relations and on the intersubjective bonds 
that normally tie together locals and migrants. In this sense, being open to differ-
ence and to the perspective of marginalized groups in society can be an antidote 
against deliberate ignorance. Unfortunately, not all such openness is authentic and 
there are ways of rejecting the other and his or her knowledge in more insidious 
forms, as we shall discuss next.
6.3.3  Masked Ignorance
Both default and deliberate ignorance share a lack of recognition of the perspective 
of the other. In contrast, masked ignorance promotes this recognition but at the sur-
face level, without any proper reflection or engagement. Paradoxically, it is the 
assumption of knowledge what sustains this particular form of ignorance as the 
person is unaware of the limits of his or her understanding. This disconnect between 
belief and reality makes masked ignorance harder to expose and counter. Indeed, we 
are sometimes pulled out of default ignorance by encounters with others and their 
perspectives that we cannot simply ignore. One can also be challenged by other 
people when displaying deliberate forms of ignorance. But masked ignorance is 
more difficult to detect and it offers the person displaying it the comfort of presup-
posing that he or she is knowledgeable and open minded. There are also degrees of 
masked ignorance and they range from everyday practices of assuming knowledge 
in order to go on interacting with others, a belief that we can easily correct if we are 
made aware of it, to the strong and radical assumption that we know what others do 
not, even those concerned by the knowledge we have.
Masked ignorance often has an important part to play in the dynamic of possibil-
ity due to its contribution to perspectival dialogues. Because we can never fully 
inhabit the perspective of the other, it is easier and faster to infer their worldview 
and take for granted our own constructions of their perspective. This is, after all, 
how we enrich our inner dialogicality and don’t end up constantly questioning our 
knowledge. In this sense, masked ignorance can keep the dialogue going. The dan-
ger, however, is that by assuming knowledge, we are not open anymore to being 
wrong or being contradicted. Social psychological research shows, in this regard, 
that the less people know, the more they are confident in their views and opinions 
(Dunning, 2014) and this can have very negative consequences for both individuals 
and society. Instead of an expanded field of possibility, we are left with predeter-
mined, narrow possibilities that are constrained by our own experience and the 
degree to which we are willing to question it. Such a dynamic can lead to monologi-
cal relations between perspectives, in which the impression of knowing dominates, 
or make way for a more authentic openness to otherness that is the marker of won-
drous ignorance (to be discussed next).
6  Ignorance and (Im)Possibility

112
Masked ignorance is often encountered in online discussions about migrants and 
refugees where it serves the purpose of legitimizing one’s own beliefs and denying 
the knowledge of others. It is common, for instance, for online participants to talk 
about the intentions, thoughts, and abilities of refugees with the certainty of some-
one who understands these perspectives “from within.” Claiming privileged knowl-
edge is coupled with lack of direct encounters with refugees and, most of all, with 
making no room for the participation of the latter in discussions that concern them. 
In these cases, acts of perspective-taking developed from an outside position 
(through essentialism and situationalism) are presented as if they are grown out of a 
commitment to similarity (e.g., identification and repositioning) (Glăveanu & de 
Saint Laurent, 2018). The interesting thing is that those who display masked igno-
rance don’t necessarily have ill intent toward migrants and refugees. Indeed, some-
times claims are made in support of migrants and refugees that assume knowledge 
about the best ways to help or protect them. Unfortunately, many of these reflect 
paternalistic tendencies in which migrants are depicted as powerless and unable to 
help themselves (De Marneffe, 2006). These assumptions are certainly harmful, as 
they place others in a position they don’t recognize or accept as their own. And, 
because of the rare – if not absent – exchanges with actual migrants and refugees, it 
is difficult to challenge masked ignorance and correct its shortcomings. There were 
a few online exchanges, however, that managed to make users reflective about their 
assumptions especially by inviting repositioning (e.g., through relating the current 
situation of refugees with the user’s family history). In a limited number of cases, 
from those studied, such dialogues led from masked to wondrous ignorance and to 
a radical openness toward the perspectives of others. Perhaps the rarity of such 
changes of perspective and movements between types of ignorance can be attributed 
to the nature of social media platforms and the fact that they don’t afford authentic 
dialogues between users (Elving & May Postma, 2017). The question then becomes 
how can we foster wondrous ignorance, online and offline? Before answering this, 
let’s consider what this last type of ignorance is.
6.3.4  Wondrous Ignorance
The discussion of default, deliberate, and masked ignorance so far paints them as 
rather negative. We see, in each case, a restriction of possibilities and a limiting 
approach to others and otherness, especially in the case of migration. For each, 
however, some beneficial aspects were noted, even if these generally led to short-
comings later on. For instance, default and deliberate ignorance have some adaptive 
value especially when it comes to the being decisive in the moment of action or 
protecting one’s self-esteem. Masked ignorance is sometimes motivated by proso-
cial intentions and can lead to helping behaviors, at least in the short term. But, by 
and large, they all work to obscure specific perspectives and isolate us from the 
people holding them, from their experience and position in the world.
V. P. Glăveanu

And yet, ignorance doesn’t have to be associated with closing down perspectives 
and the rejection of others; on the contrary, it is actually a precondition for the most 
authentic forms of openness toward all other perspectives and toward radical other-
ness. This is what I call here wondrous ignorance, the state in which the person 
relinquishes assumptions of final or certain knowledge (see also the chapter by 
Ross, this volume). In this case, not knowing doesn’t end in rejecting new knowl-
edge or in quickly getting to know (as it is the case for deliberate and masked igno-
rance) but in a fundamental openness to what is present and what is to come. This 
makes ignorance akin to wondering (Glăveanu, 2020b), a process that acknowl-
edges not knowing as a potentially generative, productive state of mind. Referring 
back to Socrates, he is widely credited for claiming that his only valid knowledge is 
that he knows nothing (Olive & McCune, 2017), something that didn’t take him to 
the path of agnosticism or nihilism but that of wonder and philosophy. In wonder, 
we are able to bracket what we think we know and question that which is most 
familiar. This is why curiosity and wonder, although closely related phenomena, 
show some marked differences (Evans & Marr, 2006; Stone, 2006), namely, the fact 
that curiosity helps us turn the unfamiliar familiar while wondering makes the 
familiar unfamiliar. Curiosity fights ignorance and considers it an obstacle to gain-
ing new knowledge. Wonder thrives on ignorance, the kind that accepts that multi-
ple perspectives exist and that one never has a full grasp of them, especially the 
perspectives of other people.
If our sense of the possible is related to recognizing multiple perspectives and 
placing them in dialogue with each other (Glăveanu, 2020a), then it requires a 
degree of humility, of admitting one’s ignorance and using it as a platform on which 
to build deeper forms of understanding. This is a very different attitude than using 
ignorance as an excuse (in default ignorance), as a tool (in deliberate ignorance), or 
as a cover-up for one’s lack of knowledge (in masked ignorance). In contrast, won-
drous ignorance enables a new type of relationship between self and world in which 
the self is both receptive and active in discovering new perspectives. This is because 
wonder itself places us at the intersection between passivity and activity, between 
being immersed into and being detached from our surroundings (Glăveanu, 2020b; 
Kareem, 2014) Ignorance helps strike this balance by keeping the person between 
not knowing and wanting to know, between a recognition of one’s own limits and an 
attempt to overcome them.
In the context of migration, wondrous ignorance serves a completely different 
purpose than default, deliberate, or masked forms do. If the latter manage to create 
distance between those who migrate and those who receive them, wonder-driven 
ignorance has the opposite effect. By recognizing the other as an expert when it 
comes to his or her own perspectives and beliefs, this state places the “ignorant” into 
the position of the learner. Moreover, it upsets established power relations whenever 
the one who experiences ignorance is also the person who is in a position to wel-
come or reject the other. In those cases, there is a genuine interest for who this 
other – migrant or refugee – is, without following stereotypes or other easy or pre-
conceived ideas. In online spaces, this kind of ignorance is rarely displayed, poten-
tially because those who participate on social media typically do so because they 
6  Ignorance and (Im)Possibility

114
have a point they want to get across and, as such, don’t allow themselves the time to 
wonder. As noted also above, it is during exchanges with other participants that 
someone can be put in the position of wondrous ignorance, for example, by making 
them aware of how they would feel if they were treated as refugees wherever they 
went (e.g., on holiday). This scaffolding of identification processes, although not 
always successful, creates a much needed space for reflection, including a reflection 
on the limits of one’s own ideas.
Returning to the question raised before, the way we can cultivate more wondrous 
forms of ignorance, either online or offline, is by shaking the participants’ belief in 
the infallibility of their own perspective. Whether it concerns migrants and refugees 
or any other aspect of the world, wondrous ignorance depends on our ability to 
question taken-for-granted knowledge and replace it with a genuine quest for under-
standing – it helps us see knowing as a continuous process, not as an outcome. 
Instead of final, singular understandings, we need to make more room for multiplic-
ity, difference, and wonder in our thinking, in our relations with others, and in our 
societies. We need, in other words, more rather than less (wondrous) ignorance.
6.4  Distributed Ignorance
In this chapter, my main aim was to go beyond common assumptions about igno-
rance and the (lack of) knowledge and connect this phenomenon to a wider horizon, 
that of the possible. At first glance, this relationship doesn’t seem obvious or, at the 
very least, it comes across as negative. Ignorance reduces our sphere of possibility, 
constrains our thinking, and limits our actions. Being ignorant is thus a marker of 
impossibility rather than possibility. And yet, this would be a misguided supposi-
tion. As our understanding of ignorance expands, we can notice valuable intersec-
tions between Ignorance Studies (Gross & McGoey, 2018; Magnani & Arfini, 2020) 
and Possibility Studies (Glăveanu, 2022). We discover, for instance, that we need a 
more nuanced understanding of ignorance in its relation to how we develop new 
perspectives on the world and take (or not) the perspective of other people. Default, 
deliberate, masked, and wondrous ignorance, described above, are not meant to 
represent final and static categories. On the contrary, I consider them as dynamic, 
relational categories that easily merge into one another in daily action and interaction.
The case of migration was useful to consider and illustrate such issues because it 
clearly embeds ignorance within self – other relations, something that resonates 
also with my particular, sociocultural approach to the possible (Glăveanu, 2020a). 
By connecting possibility to the multiplicity and dialogue of perspectives, we can 
discover new roles for ignorance in the way we notice, explore, or refuse to engage 
with the possible. In many instances, ignorant cognition is either not aware of or 
refuses perspectives, including the perspectives of others. In others, there is an 
assumption of knowing that masks a lack of understanding. And still, ignorance can 
also be a precondition for deeper forms of understanding. In fact, it can be argued 
that wondrous ignorance is essential for being genuinely open to the experience of 
V. P. Glăveanu

115
others and to perspectives different than our own. Without such open-ended, genera-
tive ignorance, we would remain trapped by our assumptions and by the lack of 
self-doubt that often characterizes human relations, especially those with people 
considered radically different.
A new vocabulary of ignorance emerges through this chapter, one that includes 
possibility-related terms such as positions and repositioning, perspectives and 
perspective-­taking, dialogue and reflexivity, mobility and immobility. In each case, 
we depart from an internalist view of ignorance, as something that “happens” within 
the head, and distribute it into the world, into how we relate to others, how we 
change our position and perspective, how we move around and encounter differ-
ence, and, most of all, how we react to it. Extended mind accounts of cognition (see 
Clark & Chalmers, 1998) started to be inspirational for ignorance scholars (e.g., 
Arfini, 2019), but there is more to explore when it comes to externalist accounts of 
ignorance. The small typology proposed here hopes to make a small contribution in 
this regard. Within it, the criterion that helps us evaluate ignorance is external to the 
ignorant mind itself. In the tradition of pragmatism and sociocultural thought, igno-
rance becomes a relation between one’s perspectives and the perspectives of others 
where perspectives themselves are not mere ideas but action orientations (Gillespie, 
2006; Martin, 2006), forged within the embodied, social, and cultural worlds we all 
inhabit. In fact, it is precisely because we live in perspectival worlds, dominated by 
a variety of positions and the relations between them, that we can become aware of 
new possibilities, overcome specific forms of ignorance, and use other forms to 
open ourselves up to otherness and to the unexpected. Mobility has a unique contri-
bution to make to our understanding of this dynamic. This chapter talked about the 
migration of people and how their perspectives are constructed by others in the host 
societies. In essence, this example reveals the possibilities and impossibilities asso-
ciated with taking the position of others, moving from one position to the next, and, 
with it, relating to the world in a different manner. There is much more to explore 
when it comes to the relation between movement – physical, social, symbolic – and 
ignorance, and I am confident that a distributed, externalist account of the latter can 
both benefit from and inform future discussions in this area.
This chapter hopes to have contributed to our understanding of ignorance and 
(im)possibility and show, among others, that there are no linear and easy connec-
tions between the two. Ignorance can be an obstacle or an enabler of possibility. It 
can present us with various impossibilities – including that of fully grasping the 
perspective of others – but it can also help us overcome the impossible and, for 
instance, change our mind about things and people we considered already known. 
What we need is a greater appreciation of the complexities of ignorance and of not 
knowing in general (Glăveanu, in press) and we also need to accumulate more prac-
tical examples of their dynamic, above and beyond the case of migration. This is, in 
the end, how Ignorance Studies are certain to reveal their own (expanded) possibili-
ties for thinking, acting, and being in the world.

Mind Invasion Through Cognitive 
Integration: Facebook and the Exploitation 
of Users’ Ignorance
Giacomo Figà Talamanca and Elisabeth Hunting
Abstract  Our aim in this chapter is to analyze the conditions for exploitative prac-
tices online through the application of the theories of cognitive integration. In this 
case, we examine Facebook as a technology that, thanks to its high cognitive inte-
grability, can foster and exploit the ignorance of users and be used to perpetrate 
epistemic injustice. Facebook enables other agents—the service providers—to 
place the platform’s users in a position of high vulnerability. They achieve this 
through manipulative design; they are able to remain hidden to users’ awareness 
while still being in a position of power towards those users. By examining the way 
the interface of this website integrates and accommodates certain cognitive prac-
tices, we will show how the reach of the online service provider goes further than 
we originally might have thought. The case of the Facebook Emotional Contagion 
Experiment is a prime example to illustrate the dangerous implications of this 
dynamic of not just cognitive integration, but covert mind invasion. In this experi-
ment, Facebook manipulated the emotional state of their users through their 
Newsfeed, without their knowledge. Since social media can invade our mind, rather 
than just influence it, it is crucial that our relationship with them is well understood 
and safeguarded.

7.1  Introduction: Otto Jones and the Accursed Notebook
Consider our beloved Otto. He needs to meet his friend Inga at the MOMA in 
New York. While Inga simply remembers the time and place of the meeting, Otto 
suffers from Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore,  he writes down in a notebook his 
schedule for the day, including his appointment with Inga. He always has the note-
book with him, making the information always available; he just needs to read the 
notebook when he opens it, making the information easily accessible; and he trusts 
the veracity of the information written on it. Clark and Chalmers (1998) famously 
argued that Otto’s notebook can be considered part of his cognitive system, an 
extension of his mind: the notebook is co-constitutive of his memory retrieval, as 
the information within it is trusted and easily accessible and available.
This idea of the extended mind became extremely influential, sparking a wide 
amount of criticisms (Adams & Aizawa, 2001, 2010; Rupert, 2004; Sterelny, 2010; 
Allen-Hermanson, 2013), variants (Menary, 2007; Rowlands, 2009; Gallagher, 
2013; Heersmink, 2015; Hutchins, 1995, 2014), and connections with pre-existing 
theories and domains (Zawidzki, 2008, 2013; Sterelny, 2010; Krueger, 2013; Varga, 
2016; Smart, 2017), forming part of the family of philosophical theories known as 
“4E” (“Embodied, Embedded, Enactive and Extended”) cognition (Newen et al., 
2018). One of the variants of Clark and Chalmers’s original idea is the theory of 
cognitive integration (Menary, 2007; Heersmink, 2015). This approach emphasizes 
cognition as a process, where artifacts are active components or practices. We will 
propose an examination of some epistemic and cognitive downsides of integrated 
cognitive systems, which, with relatively few exceptions (Slaby, 2016; Hunting, 
2020; Werner, 2021; Schwengerer, Forthcoming), has been generally ignored. We 
will here propose a thought experiment of sorts, building on Otto’s story.
Suppose that there might be more to Otto’s notebook than he thought he knew. 
His daughter bought it from a weird and shady shop, where a monkey’s paw and 
some creepy-looking dolls were also on sale. In fact, it is no ordinary notebook: it is 
under the spell of a wizard, who has direct access to the notebook’s information. All 
that Otto writes down, the wizard can see. What’s more, Otto does not know that his 
information has been sold and the wizard prefers to keep it so. The wizard has 
access to many, many notebooks across the country, and the information of tens of 
thousands of notebook owners. However, he does not use it for mind control or 
world domination: he wants money. He decides to sell all the information he has 
gained access to, without Otto knowing, to Paypal, Coca-Cola, and Steve Bannon.
Very few artifacts might be thought to not just become integrated with people’s 
cognitive practices in the way Otto’s cursed notebook can – or, at least, not in such 
a subversive way. Digital technologies such as social networking sites can be said to 
G. Figà Talamanca and E. Hunting

121
be just that kind of artifact. While they most probably don’t count as a cognitive 
extension in the sense Chalmers and Clark envisioned (Heersmink & Sutton, 2020), 
they rapidly became widely used technologies since their introduction. Social net-
working sites, such as Facebook or Twitter, are comfortable and easy-to-use plat-
forms where people can build and nurture their connections and consume a wide 
variety of information. However, it is not all fun and games. Platforms like Facebook 
have also used the data they have collected in controversial ways and with contro-
versial goals, to say the least. Examples of such malpractices included conducting a 
massive-scale experiment on the platform’s users’ social and psychological behav-
ior without their explicit consent (Grimmelmann, 2014a, b); the targeted advertising 
of teenage platform users when they showed to be in a vulnerable situation (Levin, 
2017); and, as our short thought experiment nodded to, the Cambridge Analytica 
Scandal, where data from millions of Facebook users was collected without their 
consent to be used (predominantly) for political advertising (Cadwalladr, 2018; 
Lapowsky, 2019). These events demonstrate the ethical and moral relevance of 
users’ data collection and management and the responsibilities of online service 
providers, which are issues thoroughly debated for more than a decade. However, 
what is being somewhat ignored in this debate is the understanding of how the inte-
gration of these technologies in everyday cognitive practices can enable forms of 
what we, following Slaby (2016), call mind invasion.
In this chapter, we analyze the conditions for exploitative practices online 
through the application of the theories of cognitive integration (Menary, 2007; 
Heersmink, 2015). We will specifically analyze the case of Facebook as a technol-
ogy that, thanks to its high cognitive integrability and the production of a state of 
ignorance in its users, enables other agents—the service providers1—to place the 
platform’s users in a position of high vulnerability. We will specifically illustrate 
how this dynamic is possible through the interplay of two kinds of ignorance: igno-
rance as a result of selective choice, which is inevitable and not necessarily morally 
charged; and ignorance as a result of a strategic ploy concocted with specific inter-
ests in mind (Proctor, 2008). We argue that Facebook’s designers exploit the former 
kind of ignorance, which is typical of interaction with specific cognitive artifacts, by 
maintaining users in a condition of not knowing and not questioning the designer’s 
role and gain with regards to the platform. To do so, we refer to research that 
explores the production and implications of ignorance at an individual and social 
level (Proctor & Schiebinger, 2008; Peels & Blaauw, 2016; Arfini, 2019). By exam-
ining the way the interface of this website integrates and accommodates certain 
cognitive practices, we will show how the reach of the online service provider goes 
further than one might have think. Specifically, we examine the case of the Facebook 
Emotional Contagion Experiment (Kramer et al., 2014) to illustrate the dangerous 
implications of this dynamic—since these social media wriggle their way into our 
cognitive system, rather than just influence it. Finally, we aim to show that the 
1 We will use the terms “service providers” and “platform designers” interchangeably for the 
remainder of the paper.

cognitive integration of Facebook as an artifact enables the platform’s designers to 
perpetrate a kind of epistemic injustice towards their users by placing them in a state 
of ignorance regarding the designers’ presence and goals.
In Sect. 7.2, we introduce the notion of affordances to describe what kind of pos-
sible actions Facebook as an artifact enables and to illustrate how affordances 
always imply a degree of ignorance on the agents’ side. In Sect. 7.3, we introduce 
the theory of cognitive integration and apply it to Facebook to understand it as an 
artifact, while studying on the manners each dimension leads to a degree of igno-
rance in Facebook users. In Sect. 7.4, we single out the issue of trust in the platform, 
intended as a form of deliberate ignorance and illustrate its particular relevance in 
the case of Facebook as a cognitive and social artifact. In Sect. 7.5, we introduce the 
notion of “manipulative design” to set up how Facebook users may be vulnerable in 
ways they do not expect, due to the diverging goals of platform users and the design-
ers and the manner the former are nudged to ignore the goals of the latter. In Sect. 
7.6, we take the case of the “Emotional Contagion Experiment” conducted by 
Kramer et al. (2014) to illustrate how cognitive integration and manipulative design 
put users in a condition of high vulnerability towards the platform’s designers that 
enables the perpetration of a kind of hermeneutical injustice enabled by user igno-
rance. In Sect. 7.7, we will take stock and reflect on the implications of our analysis 
for thinking about autonomy in the digital age.
7.2  The Affordances of Facebook: Salient 
and Ignored Choices
In this section, we will explain and conceptualize the affordances Facebook pro-
vides. It is the basis for how we can understand Facebook as part of a cognitive 
system or as an active part of an agent’s cognitive practices. We specifically turn to 
clarify the possible actions that Facebook enables its users to perform, given its 
social and material characteristics. Referring to Proctor (2008) and Werner (2021), 
we will show how interacting with a set of affordances always entails ignoring pos-
sibilities for actions that those affordances do not make salient or evident to agents.
The notion of affordances, elaborated by ecological psychologist J.J.  Gibson 
(1979), and later applied by Norman (1988) and Gaver (1991) in the case of techno-
logical artifacts, is understood as the set possibilities for action that an object (or a 
part of the environment) provides to an agent within an environment. The affor-
dances of an object are the possible relations between the object and the agent who 
interacts with it (Chemero, 2003; Chemero & Turvey, 2007; Lo Presti, 2016; Costa, 
2018; Baber et al., 2019). While not intrinsic characteristics of the object in ques-
tion, the possibilities for action of an object are grounded in, or related to, its physi-
cal characteristics; the agent’s characteristics; and the environment where those 
actions can be carried out. The affordances of an object are grounded in the object’s 
materiality, but they represent how a situated agent can interact with the artifact in 
different ways.
G. Figà Talamanca and E. Hunting

123
This notion has been widely applied in research on digital platforms and 
computer-­mediated communication, in order to understand the implications of these 
technologies to information consumption behavior, online intersubjectivity, and 
self-perception (Treem & Leonardi, 2013; Boyd, 2011; Marwick & Boyd, 2011; 
Rice et al., 2017; Bucher & Helmond, 2018; Phillips & Milner, 2018; Treem et al., 
2020). Because there is no generally agreed-upon categorization of the affor-
dances of digital platforms, many of the affordances in the present literature tend to 
overlap, strongly interact, or be very similar to one another. For this reason, we do 
not review and categorize all of the different affordances of social media platforms. 
Rather, we limit ourselves to introducing some of the relevant affordances of 
Facebook as a social networking site (as presented in current literature), and later 
explore how (some of) these interact with dimensions of cognitive integration.
Treem and Leonardi (2013) list four primary affordances of social media plat-
forms. We treat these affordances as a sort of “conceptual map” and refer to them to 
explicate further affordances elaborated by successive researchers in the field.2 
These affordances are:
	1.	 Editability, i.e., the possibility to craft and re-craft a piece of information online. 
This affordance is closely related to what Phillips and Milner (2018) refer to as 
the “modifiability” and “modularity” of online information, whereby the parts of 
a piece of content can be rearranged and changed without disrupting the overall 
structure of the information.
	2.	 Persistence (sometimes referred to as “reviewability” (Clark & Brennan, 1991), 
“recordability” (Hancock et al., 2007) or “permanence” (Whittaker, 2003)), i.e., 
the possibility for a piece of created content to remain accessible for a long time 
after its publication.
	3.	 Association, i.e., the possibility to create (social) ties between individuals and 
groups online, or to create a relationship(s) between an online agent and a piece 
of content, or between two pieces of content; and
	4.	 Visibility (close to Boyd’s, 2011 notion of “scalability”), i.e., the possibility for 
users to make some pieces of behavior and information (that would otherwise be 
invisible) evident and accessible to other agents online, and capture their 
attention.
These affordances often can be said to co-enable specific actions on a platform—to 
combine into new distinguishable affordances that may characterize more specific 
platforms. For instance, the affordance of “shareability” (Rice et al., 2017)—i.e., 
the possibility to share content with other people online—might be seen as involv-
ing both the visibility and the association of the information and the people involved. 
In contrast, the affordance of “searchability” (Boyd, 2011) or “archivability” 
(Phillips & Milner, 2018)—i.e., the possibility to store and look for content online 
through its categorization—involves both the visibility of said content and its 
2 Many of the affordances introduced here, including Treem and Leonardi’s, as well as those men-
tioned in the rest of the chapter, were not specifically elaborated for examining Facebook, but 
social networking sites in general.

permanence. For our purposes, we will focus on those affordances that (often com-
bined) favor Facebook’s cognitive integration.
Facebook is a digital platform, which Srnicek (2017) defines as a digital infra-
structure that enables and intermediates interaction between a variety of agents 
online. Facebook is specifically a social networking site, i.e.,
a networked communication platform in which participants 1) have uniquely identifiable 
profiles that consist of user-supplied content, content provided by other users, and/or 
system-­level data; 2) can publicly articulate connections that can be viewed and traversed 
by others; and 3) can consume, produce, and/or interact with streams of user-generated 
content provided by their connections on the site. (Ellison & Boyd, 2013, 158)
From a user’s perspective, its primary purpose is a connection with other people, 
who are either part of the user’s social network or have the potential to become part 
of it. In other words, the presence of other agents, which include not only individu-
als but other information sources (such as newspapers, magazines, political parties, 
associations, etc.) is fundamental for Facebook to work. Facebook, like all social 
media websites, is inherently a social artifact: its functionality is determined by a 
shared use by many different (kinds of) users, which is a feature with a cognitive 
impact in its own right.
To sum up, to fully understand the impact of social media technologies such as 
Facebook, we need to combine dimensions of cognitive integration with the affor-
dances of such platforms; and, at the same time, explore how the manners of this 
integration put users in a state of ignorance and vulnerability. Heersmink’s (2015) 
dimensions are a theoretical tool that captures the integration of an extra-cranial 
item into an agent’s cognitive practices; in contrast, the affordances of an item 
embody different practices and courses of action depending on the agent’s goals and 
motivations and the circumstances of the action. The affordances of Facebook can, 
in other words, ground the modalities and degree of cognitive integration in the 
artifact’s characteristics, without making strong presuppositions regarding the 
agent’s primary motivations for the use of the artifact and her specific socio-­material 
context.
It is relevant, here, to specify in what sense affordances already involve in them-
selves the production of a state of ignorance on the part of the cognitive agent. 
Specifically, the possible (inter)actions of an agent with regard to a piece of the 
environment always imply an alteration of salience: affordances make certain pos-
sible actions more salient—i.e., more prominent, visible, and clear—to an agent, 
and direct their attention and behavior towards certain courses of action more so 
than others. The creation of affordances in artifacts leads, in other words, to igno-
rance intended as the inevitable result of selective choice. When certain sets of 
actions are made more salient than others, the agent will tend to ignore courses of 
action that are not as salient as the ones that are more prominently afforded. The 
reason why this kind of ignorance is inevitable is, as Proctor (2008) points out, 
because “[I]nquiry is always selective. We look here rather than there … the deci-
sion to focus on this is therefore invariably a choice to ignore that” (p. 7). This 
dynamic is inevitable and not necessarily culpable because it is the result of the 
agent’s typically limited and environmentally situated cognitive capacities and can

be individuated as a form of cognitive confinement (Werner, 2021). Cognitive con-
finement refers to a contingent (i.e., dependent on the specific affordances the agent 
interacts with) and yet relatively stable state of being structurally or systematically 
unable to gain information from an environment, determined by patterns of interac-
tion between the subject and the world. The affordances present in a niche will 
direct the agent’s attention and agency in certain manners and courses of action and, 
inevitably, will lead her to ignore other possible courses of action and scenarios.
In the case of artifacts, this kind of ignorance is even more evident because arti-
facts are typically designed to fulfill certain purposes, more so than others. A calcu-
lator is designed to perform mathematical operations, and its material features 
afford actions with that purpose in mind; and while a calculator may be used with a 
completely different purpose (e.g., as part of an art installation) such a modality of 
use is typically not as salient to the agent in the same way that performing a calcula-
tion is.3 In other words, artifacts and man-made socio-material structures often 
direct the attention and behavior of agents towards—i.e., afford them—certain 
courses of action and, as a result, lead them to ignore others. To a certain extent, this 
is inevitable: if you want to use a calculator to perform a task, you need to ignore all 
the other possible actions you could perform with it.4 However, while this kind of 
ignorance is to a certain extent the result of a trade-off that comes with the engage-
ment with an artifact (see Sect. 7.3), an artifact’s affordances can also influence 
action in more subtle ways. Some affordances of an artifact or socio-material struc-
ture are placed with the intention of favoring certain courses of actions in predict-
able ways, while potentially bypassing the agent’s rational decision-making 
processes. Some affordances, one could say, are also nudges (Thaler & Sunstein, 
2008). This kind of affordances can make certain sets of action more salient as a 
result of the designer’s strategy—whose intention is to favor some courses of action 
and not others—while taking advantage of the agent’s ignorance when it comes to 
the selective choices she’s going to make.
In this sense, nudges are affordances that involve a different kind of ignorance, 
whereby an agent’s ignorance is an active construct, the result of a strategic choice 
from someone with interest in creating and maintaining the target agent in a state of 
ignorance (Proctor, 2008). To be precise, the designers of nudges may have an inter-
est in maintaining their targets in a state of ignorance by exploiting the inevitable 
fact that, in the course of selective choice, when an agent acts in a certain way, they 
can’t help but ignore other information and courses of action. The affordances of 
Facebook as an artifact also have this kind of influence: not only do they exist 
because they are meant to fulfill a certain purpose, but they also subtly stimulate 
certain courses of action, more so than others, because it is in the designers’ 
interests. The visibility, likeability, searchability, etc. of information online are more 
often than not courses of action that the platform’s designers want users to engage 
3 It is worth noting that salient aspects of an object vary depending on the agent’s cognitive profile 
and specific circumstances, too. A urinal did not strike anyone as something that could be made 
into an art installation before Marcel Duchamp.

in; and the platform’s features are made salient to subtly direct users’ attention and 
course of action. The interplay between the inevitable ignorance that comes with 
selective choice and the ignorance that results from a deliberate strategy is central 
to understanding the social and cognitive dynamic we are studying here. And while 
the latter kind of ignorance will be analyzed in depth in Sect. 7.5, we now turn to 
analyze the characteristics of the former in the following two sections.
7.3  The Dimensions of Integration and Affordances 
of Facebook
Now we turn to the analysis of Facebook’s cognitive impact. Specifically, we are 
going to analyze how this platform scores in each of the dimensions of cognitive 
integration theorized by Heersmink (2015; Heersmink & Sutton, 2020; Schwengerer, 
2021) and how some of these dimensions interrelate with one another and with 
some of the design features of Facebook. We now turn to describe our second major 
conceptual tool, which is the theory of cognitive integration, in order to apply it to 
the case of Facebook.
The original Extended Mind hypothesis (Clark & Chalmers, 1998; Clark, 2003), 
while influential, has also faced several challenges since its introduction.5 While 
Clark and Chalmers suggest extra-cranial items can play the same functional role as 
cranial items (take the example of Otto’s external memory; his notebook, and his 
deteriorating internal memory), this has been hotly debated. When does an artifact 
just have a causal influence on cognition, and when is it constitutive of it? And if an 
artefact actually extends my mind, where do we draw the line for such constitutive 
relation to be possible?6 The theory of cognitive integration, introduced by Menary 
(2007, 2010), deals with some typical objections of classical extended mind theo-
ries with a shift in perspective. Cognitive integration, in line with Clark (2008), 
acknowledges human beings’ natural proneness to modify their environment to 
facilitate everyday action and cognition. On this view, it is misguided to ask whether 
Otto’s notebook is constitutive of the process of remembering: What matters is that 
the artifact is used for remembering. In other words, one should not focus on 
whether the artifact is cognitive, but rather whether the practices and activities the 
5 For instance, Rupert (2004) points out that endorsing the extended mind leads to the problem of 
“cognitive bloat”: seeing the participation of extracranial items into some cognitive processes as 
co-constitutive of those processes might lead to making the idea of cognitive process somewhat 
empty of meaning. In contrast, Rowlands (2009) criticizes Clark’s notion of cognitive extension 
because it presupposes a functionalist view of the mind, which not everyone might want to buy. 
Finally, Sterelny (2010) notes that seeing extra-cranial items as extending the individual mind 
bypasses the fact that those items exist in a public dimension and are potentially subject to tamper-
ing by other agents. All of the approaches inspired by Clark and Chalmers’ original paper, includ-
ing cognitive integration, aimed at dealing with at least some of these criticisms.
6 These two criticisms were specifically brought forth by Adams and Aizawa (2001, 2010) and by 
Rupert (2004; see also Allen-Hermanson 2013), respectively.

artifact enables can be considered cognitive. Cognitive integration focuses, as 
Menary (2010, see also Sutton, 2010) points out, not so much on the functional par-
ity of the cognitive process at hand (and realizable both with or without a cognitive 
artifact), but on the complementarity of the artifact in achieving a cognitive practice.
Heersmink (2015) provides a way to capture the different manners of complemen-
tarity of cognitive artifacts by elaborating a list of dimensions of integration. His 
multidimensional approach allows for a closer analysis of the different ways an arti-
fact complements a cognitive practice. Integration can vary depending not only on the 
artifact’s characteristics but also on the agent’s cognitive profile and on whether other 
agents are involved in the artifact’s use.7 Moreover, while these dimensions of inte-
gration can be isolated and analyzed one by one in specific cases, they also overlap 
and interact with one another. The dimensions of integration that will be discussed are:
	1.	 Information Flow: The directions that information is passed on between agent(s) 
and artifact(s). It can be one-way (whereby the artifact merely provides users 
with information; for example, a road sign); two-way (whereby the user can act 
upon the artifact which can provide information in return at a different time: e.g., 
post-it notes); or reciprocal (whereby the artifact is continuously involved in an 
ongoing activity; for example, Otto’s notebook). The more continuous the infor-
mation flow in a cognitive task, the higher the degree of integration in this aspect.
	2.	 Reliability: The degree the relevant information can be safely and surely 
accessed.
	3.	 Durability: The degree of permanence of the information or of the artifact that 
enables access to it.
	4.	 Trust: The degree by which the user trusts the information provided by the 
artifact.
	5.	 Procedural Transparency: The degree of fluency in using the artifact to access 
the relevant information therein.
	6.	 Informational Transparency: The degree of fluency in understanding the relevant 
information.
	7.	 Individualization: The degree of personalization that the information (or the arti-
fact that contains it) allowed to the individual interacting with it.
	8.	 Transformation: The extent the individual’s cognitive practices and capacities 
change thanks to the use of the artifact and of the information therein.
These dimensions of integration have already been applied to digital technologies in 
recent years. Heersmink and Sutton (2020), for instance, apply these dimensions to 
Wikipedia, IMDB, and Google to explore the degree of integration of these plat-
forms. Schwengerer (2021) refers to these dimensions of integration to understand 
epistemically virtuous and vicious behavior in online information consumption. 
Hunting (2020) applies these dimensions to social media to argue that the 
7 In this chapter, we examine the relation between Facebook and an individual user. For this reason, 
we do not mention accounts of distributed cognition (Hutchins, 1995, 2014), with which not only 
Heersmink’s dimensions are compatible with, but which would require a different kind of analysis 
that goes beyond our current scopes.
7  Mind Invasion Through Cognitive Integration: Facebook and the Exploitati…

128
integration of an artifact does not always count as an enhancement of the agent’s 
cognitive capacities, but can even lead to some dysfunctionalities in cognitive pro-
cessing. We are going to apply these dimensions to Facebook—which, while also a 
web-based technology, has some features that distinguish it severely from the web-
sites listed above.
Due to the inherent social or collective nature of Facebook, we believe it appro-
priate to add a further dimension of integration, which is not considered by 
Heersmink. This dimension, which we call institutionalization,8 is intended to take 
into account the way social practices can aid, enable, and transform certain cogni-
tive processes. Gallagher (2013; Gallagher & Crisafi, 2009) argues that certain 
social practices and institutions can not only participate in our cognitive processes 
but even enable certain cognitive practices that would otherwise not be possible 
before. A legal contract, for instance, enables a wide array of activities and thoughts 
that would not be otherwise possible, and it is ultimately grounded in practices that 
are shared within a community. Museums, legal systems, education systems and 
other social structures all share this characteristic. One might not want to consider 
an institution or (set of) social norms as being casually coupled to an agent in the 
same way Otto’s notebook is (Menary, 2013). Institutions and social practices can 
be said to enable an array of practices and cognitive processes in a different manner 
to that of an artifact because it involves other minds, organizations, cooperation, and 
the normativity underlying socially shared practices and institutions. And most 
importantly, the reason why institutions enable and transform cognitive practices is 
that individual agents partake in them together: their cognitive impact on individu-
als is possible because they contribute to these institutions. This is the most distinc-
tive aspect of practices and artifacts whose functionality relies on socially shared 
norms (Slors, 2019, 2020). To highlight this distinction as a phenomenon of its own, 
we introduce a new dimension of integration:
	9.	 Institutionalization: the use of the artifact is intelligible and functional only inso-
far as a community of agents uses it collectively.9
8 The treatment of institutionalization as a separate dimension is inspired by recent work by Slors 
(2019, 2020), who refers to cognition transformed by institutions as symbiotic cognition. While he 
treats it as a phenomenon on its own, it may also be seen as a dimension of integration in 
Heersmink’s sense (Slors, personal communication, June 14, 2021). We call it institutionalization 
instead of symbiosis for the mere purpose of clarity.
9 We are aware that Gallagher (2013) sees the coupling of an institution as fulfilling all the criteria 
that Clark and Chalmers (1998) envisioned for an artifact to be constitutive of a cognitive system. 
However, not just as Menary (2013) and Slors (2020) point out, but by Gallagher’s own admission, 
the institution does not stand in a causal relation with the agent. Rather, Gallagher sees the cogni-
tive complementarity of the institution as a form of engagement and not, first and foremost, as a 
causal coupling. While this conception might lead to the problem of “cognitive bloat” (Rupert, 
2004, and Menary, 2013 with regards to Gallagher, 2013), and while it is debated whether cogni-
tion in itself might be but a form of engagement with the world (see e.g., Werner, 2020), we prefer 
to count the value of institutions in complementing cognitive processing as a separate dimension, 
in order to have a clear understanding of its role in cognitive processes that are integrated with 
Facebook. To engage properly with such debates would lead far off the purpose of this chapter.

129
Now that we have laid out our theoretical basis, we can analyze Facebook as a 
cognitive artifact by elaborating how the dimensions of integration interact with 
each other and with the affordances of Facebook. We will demonstrate how 
Facebook has a very high potential to become a deeply integrated cognitive artifact. 
The dimension of trust will be the most important one for two reasons: firstly, in this 
case, it drives the integration the most; and secondly, there is an inherent ambiguity 
regarding trust in the context of digital platforms such as Facebook, since there is a 
difference between the trust in the artifact and the service provider. Specifically, we 
argue that trust in the platform leads to ignoring, or not questioning, the intentions 
of the platform’s designer—i.e., the service provider, and thus the design of the 
platform itself.
Thanks to Facebook’s deep cognitive integration and trust, we shall show how it 
can produce and maintain ignorance in its users, and how it causes epistemic injus-
tice. One can see ignorance as a binding thread that connects the somewhat inevi-
table state of cognitive confinement, the various dimensions of cognitive integration, 
and the perpetration of epistemic injustice on the service provider’s side. When it 
comes to the cognitive integration of an artifact, as Copeland (this volume) points 
out, in the case of agent-artifact coupling, there is often a degree of ignorance 
involved as a form of “trade off.” For instance, once I rely on a notebook for mem-
ory retrieval, I can afford to forget and not know what my plans for the day are; and 
once I use a calculator for complex mathematical operations, I may be completely 
ignorant regarding more or less complex procedures. Much of this section will then 
consist in an exploration of these various trade-offs that characterize the various 
dimensions of integration. Specifically, in most cases, user ignorance is the result of 
a construction of knowledge-based habits (see Sect. 7.3.1) that are enabled by the 
high scores of each dimension, as well as a result of cognitive confinement. However, 
each dimension characterizes the institution of such habit and confinement in differ-
ent manners. Especially trust in the artifact and the service provider are key to 
understanding how these technologies involve ignorance to a much more significant 
degree and have the potential to harm user autonomy, which is why we will analyze 
trust separately in Sect. 7.4. 
7.3.1  Reliability and Durability
Reliability involves the degree to which the information can be readily and stably 
accessed. The degree of Facebook’s score in this dimension will often be deter-
mined by the amount of usage of the platform and by the ways the platform is used. 
On the one hand, what one could call “the lower end of the spectrum”, a user might 
be registered to the platform exclusively to privately message somebody she could 
not reach otherwise. On the other hand, people can use Facebook for a variety of 
purposes, including interacting with other (possible) members of one’s (online) 
social networks; sharing with members of that social network one’s own thoughts or 
other activities and situations the user is currently involved in; readily consuming

information from sources such as news organizations, magazines, and blogs; sup-
porting and receiving updates regarding businesses, institutions and brands that may 
be present on the platform; and visibly engaging with all these forms of content 
(through commenting under posts and sharing that content on one’s own personal 
page). It is important to note that given the range of possible activities a user might 
perform while on Facebook, there is relatively high potential for reliable usage of 
Facebook—for at least one of these activities.
A characteristic of many web-based platforms (including Facebook), closely 
linked to the dimension of reliability, is the durability of information online. Unless 
a web-based platform is shut down and/or reformatted, once information is 
stored therein, it has the potential to remain online indefinitely. On Facebook, once 
the user posts a piece of content, the information has the potential to remain there as 
long as her profile (or the specific post) is not deleted or blocked. The same goes for 
information that is shared (via posts or comments) by other agents on the platform. 
Facebook affords a high degree of what Phillips and Milner (2018) call archivability 
and searchability. Users are, in other words, capable of finding with relative ease 
any piece of information through the platform’s search engine. And once some con-
tent is posted, the user can store the relevant piece of information (through options 
such as saving the link to the post) and eventually replicate the content she found 
(for instance by sharing a singular post of another information source or a hyperlink 
to share).
In other words, the durability of information on platforms like Facebook heavily 
supports its reliable access: the information is available primarily because of its 
permanence on the web. While for non-web-based artifacts, the permanence of the 
information they contain is intrinsically linked to the permanence of the artifact 
itself (so that, were Otto’s notebook destroyed, the information therein would be 
lost), in the case of digital platforms like Facebook, the information can remain 
online independently of the piece of technology used to access it (be it a smart-
phone, a PC, a tablet, etc.). It is access to the information, and not the specific arti-
fact used to access that information, that matters in cognitive integration (Smart, 
2017; Heersmink & Sutton, 2020). This kind of flexibility in the manner by which 
online information is accessed can be seen as supporting a higher score in reliabil-
ity, for the information itself can be accessed through more than one device.
Reliable access to Facebook and the durability of the information therein espe-
cially highlight one epistemological implication of the platform’s integration to the 
agent’s cognitive practice. This aspect stands for this couple of dimensions as well 
as the others, and it consists in the fixation of the agent’s beliefs surrounding the 
platform through habit. In line with Piercean epistemology, Arfini (2019) points out 
how beliefs (and specifically beliefs that are taken to be true, i.e., presumed knowl-
edge) constitute a grounding for habitual action: once an agent forms some beliefs 
regarding a state of affairs she habitually engages with, those beliefs are going to 
ground her reasoning and agency in that domain. In other words, many of an agent’s 
beliefs are going to take a normative function in her agency and reasoning, unless 
they are challenged in some way or other—they contribute to knowledge-based 
habits. This is a particularly tricky situation because, as Arfini herself points out,

ignorance is tacit. An agent’s ignorance will not become apparent to her up until the 
moment that she doubts the validity of her own beliefs and realizes that she is igno-
rant. The epistemological trickiness is derived from the fact that a (presumed) 
knowledge-based habit is grounded in what the agent takes to be true belief, and the 
questioning of such veracity—and of the legitimacy of the habit—is not motivated 
under “normal” circumstances.
The high degree of reliability in information access and durability, as well as the 
reliable functioning of the platform for the tasks it’s designed to perform, play 
exactly this kind of grounding role for users’ epistemic agency within the platform. 
Not only the reliable access and use of Facebook, but also the durability of the infor-
mation can make users feel comfortable when it comes to their beliefs on the plat-
form’s reliability and overall functionality.10 These dimensions are some of the most 
important enablers for habitual use of the platform, especially when considering 
that not only the information in the platform is durable and easily accessible but the 
platform itself and the actions it affords are too. If the platform works as the agent 
expects, then the agent may not question and ignore the platform’s characteristics 
that are not directly related to her own beliefs and goals. Nor will the agent be moti-
vated to choose alternative ways to perform the tasks enabled or facilitated by 
Facebook. Reliability and durability are some of the dimensions that grant the pos-
sibility for the formation of a habitual relation between user and platform. And once 
such a habit is formed, the agent will take it as a driving force in Facebook use and 
generally ignore whether the habit in itself is properly justified—for she will not 
have evidence or motivation to do so. The connection between habitual Facebook 
use and ignorance regarding the platform’s more general characteristics and func-
tions—i.e., that go beyond the user’s own enjoyment and goals—are particularly 
relevant in all of the other dimensions, but they are primarily grounded in the reli-
ability, accessibility, and durability of the platform and of the information therein.
7.3.2  Informational and Procedural Transparency
Facebook has the potential to score very high on informational transparency. 
Informational transparency is not entirely deducible from the information alone, but 
also depends on the user’s cognitive profile and capacity: a manual written in 
Russian is informationally opaque to an English speaker but not to a Russian one. 
Facebook is designed with the intent to favor user engagement as much as possible: 
the different items of the Newsfeed are intended to be the focus center of the user’s 
10 We are not going to address here the risk of mis- and dis-information that is commonly associ-
ated with social media use. We are not arguing that the reliability of the artifact’s functioning and 
of the information’s accessibility provides a justification for Facebook users to take the informa-
tion they find as truthful. Rather, we believe that reliability, especially coupled with the highly 
personalized and institutionalized dimensions of Facebook (see Sect. 7.3.3) might make users 
more prone to take the information they find as reliable, even if it is not actually truthful.

132
attention. The content is in large part generated by members of the user’s network 
and other deliberately followed information sources and therefore is often created 
by agents the user will be familiar with. The information source itself is often 
spelled out in the Newsfeed presentation format, as, on top of each item, the content 
source—itself a Facebook subscriber or page—is spelled out for the user to see. The 
platform can also  provide content in the Newsfeed independently of the user’s 
deliberations. Sometimes the algorithms propose content that the user shared in the 
past; content based on the user’s previously consumed information and declared 
preferences (“recommended for you”). In the first case, the user will probably see 
the content as transparent, given that the proposed content is meant to evoke a mem-
ory (Heersmink, 2020). In the latter, the Facebook algorithm itself will attempt to 
make their suggested content as transparent as possible. In other words, users can 
customize the platform and its content to make it transparent, which is also in the 
platform’s interests since it maximizes user engagement.
Informational transparency can be considered one of the most important aspects 
of many web-based platforms and social media sites. As Stohl et al. (2016) and 
Treem et al. (2020) point out, the notion of visibility is considered as a particularly 
multifaceted affordance in the context of web-based platforms and computer-­
mediated communication. It can be understood as the ability to make some pieces 
of information shown to others, who couldn’t see it otherwise (Treem & Leonardi, 
2013), to redirect one’s own and others’ attention to some objects and events 
(Hatuka & Toch, 2017), and the means and methods for managing one’s own self-­
presentation online and to retrieve the information of others (Bregman & 
Haythornthwaite, 2001). The complexity and relevance of visibility online are due 
to the fact that web-based platforms are constituted by information (Arfini et al., 
2019) that is intended to be consumed by the platform’s user. Informational trans-
parency and visibility go hand in hand and the possibility for a high degree of the 
latter implies a high potential for the former.
The role of algorithms in information provision is deeply connected to another 
dimension of integration, that is procedural transparency, which is close to what 
Heidegger calls the “ready-at-hand” character of many artifacts (Heidegger, 1962). 
Facebook’s interface is transparent when it comes to many of the possible actions 
that users may decide to uptake: liking (or reacting to), sharing and leaving a com-
ment under a post on the Newsfeed are actions that are visible and clearly indicated 
to users with respective buttons so that users do not need to actively seek how to 
perform such actions. Reacting to a post in a different manner than the like requires 
tapping (or clicking) the like button for one second, making this action fairly auto-
matic. The production of new posts is one of the most salient afforded actions on the 
Newsfeed, as just above the earliest visualizable content the interface offers a blank 
text bar where the user is called by name and asked “What’s on your mind?” The 
loading of further content on the Newsfeed is also relatively effortless, as on the 
smartphone all is needed is to scroll the screen with a finger for visualizing new 
posts, which can appear very quickly due to the algorithm’s ranking and selection 
system (see Sect. 7.3.4) insofar as an internet connection is available. The plat-
form’s search engine enables users to find specific content or other agents (both, 
G. Figà Talamanca and E. Hunting

133
members of their social network and outsiders) relatively quickly and to eventually 
receive more frequent updates from that specific information source or even block 
them (see Sect. 7.3.1). Furthermore, not only users can relatively easily access their 
own personal profile page to modify their own personal information and explicit 
preferences when it comes to content, but each kind of autobiographical and per-
sonal information to be inputted is clearly categorized. And finally, the act of seek-
ing further content on the newsfeed is achievable through relatively easy actions: 
specifically, scrolling through one’s own Newsfeed on a device can be achieved 
with the simple movements of a finger. Overall, then, the handiness of Facebook 
and the clarity in which possible actions are laid out to the user enables a high score 
in procedural transparency.11
Informational and procedural transparency also favor a certain degree of igno-
rance on the user’s side, closely connected to the kind mentioned in Sect. 7.3.1. Not 
only the ready-at-handiness of the platform and the easy interpretability of the 
information therein are contributing factors to reinforce the habituation of users to 
the platform. In fact, the ease in use and interpretation can also be considered, in 
Nguyen’s (2021) words, seductively clear. Because the platform is very easy to use, 
and because the information is easy to interpret, Facebook can lead to create a feel-
ing of clarity regarding the functionality of the platform and the understanding of 
the content therein. Due to the great importance of visibility and editability in 
Facebook, information that is easy to consume is privileged insofar as it appears 
clear to users, in ways that face-to-face interaction may apparently not be able to 
achieve. For instance, the (perceived) popularity of another Facebook user can be 
quantified by the number of likes or followers that are recorded in that user’s page; 
the same goes for a piece of content and its reactions to it. Furthermore, a comment 
under a piece of content can seemingly provide a window behind how that person 
feels about that content and a glimpse of her beliefs and values, which in turn can 
provide some sort of evidence in one’s evaluation of that person. Information 
encountered on Facebook and the platform’s use are seductively clear in the sense 
that their transparency—both in the platform’s functioning and in the “real-world” 
information the platform provides—while pleasurable for users, are not necessarily 
accurate in what they seemingly entail to represent. And this feeling of clarity can 
lead users to ignore the possibility that they may not actually grasp (some aspects 
of) the platform’s functioning or the information therein. In other words, the feeling 
of clarity that comes with high transparency and visibility can lead users to not 
11 It is relevant to note that Heersmink and Sutton (2020) might see the fact that the average user 
does not know how a platform’s algorithm works as harming procedural transparency (they refer 
to the case of Google, but the same thought can be easily applied to Facebook). While the lack of 
knowledge regarding the algorithm’s functioning is relevant in this context (see Sect. 7.3.4), we do 
not believe that it harms procedural transparency. To propose a parallel example: one does not need 
to know how the pages of a notebook stick together or how the ink sticks to the pages for the note-
book to be procedurally transparent. Nor do you need to know the function of the quartz in your 
wristwatch to understand how to use it to know what time it is. We believe that the transparency of 
an artifact’s mechanisms matter as long as it facilitates the cognitive practices its users want to 
carry out.

134
doubt their understanding of the platform and its content and to ignore the possibil-
ity that they might be mistaken.
7.3.3  Individualization and Institutionalization
These dimensions brings forth some of the most salient and interesting features of 
Facebook as a cognitive artifact. When it comes to individualization, the platform 
affords its users to connect with their own social network, to personalize the content 
that might appear on the newsfeed, and, very importantly, to generate (i.e., post) 
their own content—what they have in mind, what is it that they are doing, to express 
what they value and like. The very configuration of Facebook’s interface revolves 
around enabling a very high degree of personalization, to enable the user to tailor 
and set up her own preferences in terms of content to be consumed and produced, 
network quality and extension, and presence and self-presentation on the platform. 
In other words, Facebook has the potential for being highly individualized (and to 
an extent, as access to Facebook requires users to create a personalised profile, indi-
vidualisation can be considered a pre-requirement of the platform). This is not espe-
cially surprising if we consider the service provider’s objective, which is the 
gathering of user data, to be acquired and sold to third parties. The higher the degree 
of individualization, the higher the amount of data that the user will provide.
Furthermore, the affordance of editability (Treem & Leonardi, 2013) can further 
enable a high degree of personalization. Facebook users are not only able to create 
and generate their own content, sharable in the form of text, images, videos, or a 
combination thereof. Users have the possibility to find a piece of content and, one 
could say, re-appropriating it with more or less substantial modifications. A user 
may, for instance, come to visualize a post from an information source and share 
that source’s post by adding a further piece of text before posting it themselves. This 
practice can be understood as a practice of appropriation and transformation of 
content, which is especially enabled by the modularity of online information 
(Phillips & Milner, 2018)—i.e., the possibility to manipulate, re-arrange and/or sub-
stitute digitized parts of a larger whole without disrupting or destroying the overall 
structure of the information in question. In general, not only a Facebook user can 
find (or be provided) content in accordance with her (both shown and deduced) 
preferences but can also re-appropriate that content and change it for maximizing 
self-expression within her social network—with a relatively high degree of proce-
dural transparency (see Sect. 7.3.2). For these reasons, Facebook can enable a very 
high degree of individualization.
When it comes to institutionalization, however, Facebook demonstrates some 
very exceptional features when compared to many, non-web-based cognitive arti-
facts. As we pointed out in Sect. 7.2, the success of cognitive artifacts often presup-
poses the presence of socially shared and followed norms. However, there are social 
institutions (such as the legal system) whose existence and functionality rely entirely 
on collective agreement and rule-following and that facilitate and transform 
G. Figà Talamanca and E. Hunting

135
cognitive processes (Gallagher, 2013; Gallagher & Crisafi, 2009). While these insti-
tutions do not extend cognitive processing in the same way artifacts do (Menary, 
2013), they do enable new kinds of interaction and information processing that 
would be impossible, should these institutions not exist (Slors, 2019, 2020). What is 
interesting about Facebook, and social media in general, is that they possess this 
institutional dimension: if only one agent would be using Facebook, without any 
other agent being also logged in the platform, the platform would lose its purpose 
and become ineffective.12 Specifically, if only one agent would be on Facebook, 
without other people that can interact with the content she produces or produce 
content of their own, then the platform would lose its functionality. There would not 
be the chance to create and tailor an online social network of friends, nor to con-
sume possible content—for there is no content on Facebook if no one generates it. 
Facebook use is primarily motivated by interacting with other friends, acquain-
tances, and family members, consuming content from them and other information 
sources (including news companies, blogs, companies, and businesses), expressing 
themselves, and cultivating their own interests and image in front of one’s own 
social network. Many of Facebook’s affordances highlight the importance of the 
social dimension. As Rice et al. (2017) point out, the shareability of information on 
Facebook implies that the possibility of involving more or less specific members of 
one’s social network in consuming generated content (and to be involved when oth-
ers generate content) is a central motivation for Facebook use. The same goes for 
the evaluability of information, which relies on the possibility to provide or receive 
feedback from other agents regarding a piece of content or another information 
source in the form of feedback, reactions (e.g., likes), and comments.
The analysis of these two dimensions of integration can also expand the degree 
and modalities of user ignorance so far explored. When it comes to personalization, 
a high score in this dimension also strengthens user ignorance as the result of habit. 
If customizing my own (tightly integrated) notebook and recognizing the notebook 
as my own would lead me to not inquire regarding the veracity, trustworthiness, or 
reliability of the notebook as a cognitive artifact, the same can be said for Facebook, 
whose use entails that people on it create a personalized profile on the platform. The 
very formation of a personalized social media profile can be seen as intended to 
make users not just acquainted with the platform and favor reliable use, but specifi-
cally comfortable and confident about it.
When it comes to institutionalization, the fact that Facebook is used not only by 
a large number of people in general but especially by many members of the user’s 
offline social network(s) can support the reinforcement of ignorance understood as 
the result of habit. Specifically, through a form of bandwagon appeal, the fact that a 
wide amount of people seemingly use and rely on the platform habitually (which is 
one of the fundamental requirements for Facebook to actually function), then an 
12 In such a scenario, the only possible use of Facebook would be as a sort of private, multimedial 
diary; but the platform would not be particularly better suited than many other web-based tech-
nologies. After all, Facebook is a social networking site, an artifact primarily designed (and mar-
keted) to create and curate one’s own social network.

136
individual user will feel more comfortable to use the platform habitually as well. A 
high score in institutionalization, however, shows that Facebook implies two differ-
ent kinds of the “epistemic tradeoffs” (Copeland, this volume) that characterize 
cognitive extension. On the one hand, Facebook is a technological artifact, and to 
achieve the task that the artifact affords its users may either ignore more effortful 
ways to achieve that task as well as the specific functioning of the artifact itself. 
However, on the other hand, the institutional character of Facebook also entails that 
a variety of cognitive tasks are off-loaded to other people and the social practices 
they partake in. The practice of liking or sharing some content can be considered as 
the result of this kind of trade-off: gaining information on any given topic is the 
result of someone else’s cognitive labor (i.e., the person sharing a piece of content 
online), while also being a common practice for many platform users encouraged by 
the platform’s interface. The off-load of cognitive effort in information retrieval to 
consolidated social practices affords individuals to form a knowledge-based habit in 
the platform’s use and to ignore and not seek further understanding of the platform 
and the social activities it affords.
7.3.4  Information Flow and Transformation
Facebook, similarly to many social networking sites, enables a reciprocal informa-
tion flow because, as a cognitive artifact, it can become an integral part of an ongo-
ing activity. We believe that a Facebook user “offload[s] small pieces of information 
into the artifact, and the nature and content of the offloaded information contributes 
to and partly determines the next step in the overall process” (Heersmink, 2015, 
584). This is possible through Facebook’s use of algorithms. The algorithms of 
many web-based platforms are designed to promote further engagement. In general, 
the interaction between an internet user and intelligent software can be character-
ized as follows:
	1.	 The [algorithm] has to choose from a set of available actions that bring about 
interaction with the user. For example, recommending a video or news item; sug-
gesting an exercise in a tutoring task; displaying a set of products and prices, and 
perhaps also the context, layout, order, and timing with which to present them.
	2.	 The user chooses an action, thereby revealing information about their knowledge 
and preferences to the controlling agent, and determining the utility of the choice 
the ISA [Intelligent Software Agents] made.
	3.	 The cycle repeats, resulting in a process of feedback and learning. (Burr et al., 
2018, 736).13
13 Note that for the purpose of this chapter, it is not relevant whether the algorithm itself is autono-
mous: this reflection would be relevant when analyzing web-based platforms such as Facebook 
from the perspective of distributed cognition. However, as we are analyzing the relation between 
the individual user and the artifact—and its implications for the relation between individual user 
G. Figà Talamanca and E. Hunting

137
If we keep in mind that it is in the platform’s designers’ interests to gain the high-
est amount of data possible regarding the platform’s users, then it is a safe bet to 
believe that one of the primary goals of Facebook’s algorithms is user engagement 
(Srnicek, 2017; Burr et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2020): The more a user interacts 
with (a piece or set of) information, the more an algorithm will provide content to 
the user’s Newsfeed that is similar to the one previously consumed, in order to 
maximize engagement. In other words, Facebook users, by using the platform and 
engaging with some content, leave some traces that the platform’s algorithm can 
read so that the algorithm can then provide further information that the user did 
not see or previously know. Furthermore, the informational traces that the user 
leaves on the website and that the algorithm consumes are given not only by the 
user’s posted content but also by the number of visible reactions (such as likes and 
contents) to other posts and agents. This dynamic in human-algorithm interaction 
enables, strictly speaking, a reciprocal information flow—with one important dis-
tinction with regards to many, non-web-based cognitive artifacts. The reciprocal 
information flow of materially off-loaded tasks such as calculating or writing an 
academic manuscript on a piece of paper “originates” from the artifact’s user: the 
user intends to perform a task, and by off-loading some bits of information onto 
an external source she can discover and change some aspects of that task. It seems 
that many cognitive artifacts stand in a passive relation to their user in terms of 
information flow, in the sense that only the user is actively involved in information 
off-load, consumption, and transformation. In contrast, the reciprocity of the 
information flow with Facebook (as with many other web-based platforms) is 
enabled by the activity of both the user and the artifact. The former consumes and 
off-loads information and the other notes the off-­loaded and consumed content 
and deduces and provides further content to be engaged with, with further infor-
mation off-load from the user, and so on.
Facebook, as many social media platforms at large, has a somewhat specific 
characteristic that distinguishes it from a wide majority of cognitive artifacts. Otto’s 
notebook, compasses, GPS navigators, road signs—all of these artifacts commonly 
involved in cognitive tasks have an immediate function: they are intrinsically goal-­
directed, in the sense that they are often involved in the achievement of some spe-
cific task, such as information retrieval and navigation. Even many web-based 
platforms such as IMDB, Wikipedia, or Google Search, analyzed through the lens 
of cognitive integration by Heersmink and Sutton (2020), fulfill a specific goal from 
their users, that is information seeking. In this regard, social media such as Facebook 
can be said to stand out: these platforms are particularly apt for spending time with-
out a specific goal in mind. In other words, one might spend time on Facebook for 
no reason at all, enabling what Bruineberg and Fabry (2021), call “extended mind-­
wandering,” i.e., habitual, ritualistic, and/or distracted use of cognitive artifacts 
and designer—it suffices to consider algorithms as part of the infrastructure of the platform. While 
we believe that the two perspectives are not mutually exclusive, but that they should be considered 
at two different levels of abstraction.

138
(typically smartphones) that is task-unrelated and lacking intentionality and atten-
tional guidance.
To summarize, while Facebook does afford the user the creation, extension, and 
curation of their social network and their public image, as well as information con-
sumption from desired sources, analyzing this platform while assuming users would 
only use it for these specific purposes would be reductive. The task-free use of 
Facebook is also in line with the theoretical motivations of the complementarity 
principle: the integration of extracranial items into cognitive practices can lead to 
the transformation of those practices into a new process or a variety of processes. 
Facebook affords keeping in contact with already known people and connecting 
with others, information consumption from known sources and the discovery of 
new content and sources, the externalization of content, and the remembrance of 
previously posted one—a wide range of activities, and not one specific task. 
Furthermore, the consideration of inattentive and task-free Facebook use has impor-
tant implications when it comes to the implication for the autonomy and vulnerabil-
ity of Facebook users due to the cognitive integration of this artifact. Task-free 
Facebook use implies that its users will tend to not consciously or frequently reflect 
about the artifact’s underlying mechanisms and of the information that the Newsfeed 
provides.
Information flow in particular is the final dimension characterizing the formation 
of a knowledge-based habit in Facebook use, specifically with regards to the actual 
functioning of the platform. As we’ve seen, what enables a reciprocal and generally 
smooth information flow between user and platform is the incessant activity of 
Facebook’s algorithms in providing content and deducing what content the user 
might be likely to interact with. The algorithms at work in this process are not per-
ceptually available as such to users: even when a post is accompanied by the phrase 
“recommended for you”—and makes explicit that that content was placed by the 
algorithm’s initiative—the user visualizing that content does not see the actual algo-
rithm at work. Information flow and the structural and yet unseen workings of 
Facebook’s algorithms mutually reinforce each other: the latter is what enables the 
former, and as long as the information flow is smooth and continuous the user’s 
attention will not be drawn to the platform’s “inner” mechanisms. Furthermore, 
task-free Facebook use is a poignant example of an arguably “lower-order” cogni-
tive activity, which not only consists in a somewhat passive stance from the user 
towards the artifact and requires little reflection and attention but can also easily 
become habitual. Task-free Facebook use can become a knowledge-based habit that 
relies on a relatively low amount of cognitive effort on the user’s side (especially 
thanks to procedural and informational transparency). The “little” amount of knowl-
edge necessary for these cognitive practices demonstrates the clearest how a knowl-
edge-based habit leads the agent’s attention towards certain aspects of the world she 
engages in (in this case, the platform). The creation of such a habit, however, can 
easily lead her to ignore aspects of the world or of her own beliefs that, while not as 
salient, should actually be more of a source of care and concern to her.
Most importantly, for our purposes, however, acknowledging the task-free use of 
Facebook enables this technology to score high on another dimension of 
G. Figà Talamanca and E. Hunting

139
integration, which is transformation. Its high score is primarily due to its close con-
nection with all other dimensions explored so far. Like many social media plat-
forms, Facebook is primarily intended for the cultivation and extension of one’s 
own social network, self-presentation, and information consumption. The use of 
social media such as Facebook (especially when accessed through a smartphone) 
can be very casual and without a clear goal. Not only that, but users can eventually 
turn on notifications so that when possibly relevant updates on the platform occur 
(e.g., friend requests and posting of new content from selected information sources), 
they can log in to Facebook to visualize them. In general, Facebook is involved in 
so many different cognitive practices that are easy to partake in. The platform is, 
after all, designed to favor engagement with its content and to capture user attention 
as much as possible, with the possibility of continuously providing new content and 
suggest new members of their social network as long as there is an internet connec-
tion available. The multiplicity of cognitive practices afforded by one single artifact 
is not particularly exceptional: a notebook can be used for many different and 
impactful activities from information retrieval, calculations, sketching, and so forth, 
as we have thoroughly explored in the previous subsections (see esp. Sect. 7.3.3). 
But in the same way that the off-loading of information through writing into porta-
ble and easy-to-use artifacts has had long-term consequences for human evolution, 
web-­based technologies have a similar massive potential in the transformation of 
human cognitive practices—not just in terms of efficient or quick problem solving 
or in terms of a wide variety of social and epistemic actions through one artifact, but 
even in thinking of oneself as an individual, as part of a social network and com-
munity, and in the modality of valuing social status and connections.
7.4  Trust in Facebook: Deliberate Ignorance 
and Boosted Confidence
We now turn to the analysis of the last dimension of integration, which is trust. For 
the purposes of this chapter, trust is incredibly important. Thanks to the high scor-
ing of all other dimensions of integration, trust can already be easily gained: as 
Schwengerer (Forthcoming) puts it, the high user-friendliness of technologies like 
Facebook is going to (intentionally) make that piece of technology feel trustwor-
thy to its user. However, there is more to trust than just those dimensions and it is 
key to understanding the complex interplay between users, the platform and the 
platform’s designers. For trust always entails, from the trustor’s perspective, a 
degree of ignorance: when trusting someone or something, the trustor will (explic-
itly or implicitly) choose to not constantly see to it that the entrusted action will be 
carried out. It specifically involves what one might call a suspension of judgment, 
a lack of conscious and continuous evaluation of the trustee and, overall, the taking

140
of a risk.14 This is the common understanding of trust in 4E cognition literature 
(Clark & Chalmers, 1998; Clark, 2003; Sterelny, 2010; Arango-Muñoz, 2013; 
Heersmink, 2015; Smart, 2017). And while there are many strategies and contin-
gencies that can minimize risk, the agent’s trust always implies their not actually 
knowing whether the risk taken will pay off. In this section, we specifically ana-
lyze the trust of Facebook as a platform—as an artifact and an information source. 
However, we furthermore believe that the trusting of the artifact leads to not trust-
ing the platform’s designer, but to pay no attention to them—and specifically, to 
ignore their more or less explicitly stated goals.
This generalized understanding of trust is best captured by Nguyen’s 
(Forthcoming) account of trust as an unquestioning attitude. He specifically elabo-
rates this account to show that not just agents, but even artifacts can be trusted to the 
point that the truster can actually feel betrayed, should her expectations be discon-
firmed. And while for interpersonal trust the breaking of trust arises due to a form 
of betrayal or carelessness on the side of the trustee, in the case of artifact, trust is 
broken when the artifact does not function as expected. We trust an artifact when we 
expect it to fulfill a certain function, or to support or outright carry out an action. To 
trust something in this sense means that we “rely on it while putting its reliability 
out of mind” (10). For an agent to trust something (or someone), then, it is not only 
to accept that object will fulfill its function (or that the agent will hold to her com-
mitment) but to refrain from questioning the acceptance regarding the object’s func-
tionality (or the agent’s commitment). Understood this way, the experience of 
betrayal when an agent breaks the trust given to her derives from the infringement 
of a commitment, which is normatively charged. In contrast, and very fittingly for 
our immediate purposes, the feeling of betrayal or alienation we experience when 
an artifact we use does not work as we expect derives from its incorporation into our 
everyday practices. If such an object malfunctions, it disrupts the functional unity of 
our agency. Nguyen’s theory of trust, which involves both apt and inapt trust, as 
well as explicit (i.e., conscious decision of not questioning) or implicit (whereby 
this decision is not consciously made but grown out of habit or social feedback), 
therefore focuses on the utility and centrality of trust as both a “cognitive grease.” 
This means that trust, as an unquestioning attitude, is a structural feature of our 
everyday life: questioning continuously whether the ground you walk on is going to 
crumble, or whether the food you eat is edible every day, or whether your friends are 
actually your friends will entail an impairment to your normal functioning as a liv-
ing being. In this sense, trust characterizes human relations with other people, arti-
facts, and institutions and, at the same time, a means to outsource our agency to 
14 This aspect of trust is clear in the philosophical literature that sees it as oriented to other agents. 
Wanderer and Townsend (2013) spell this out with the following example: if you allegedly entrust 
a babysitter with taking care of your child, but then continuously observe her while taking care of 
the child (e.g., through security cameras), then you do not really trust her. Trust always involves a 
lack of, if not conscious awareness, attention to the trustee’s action or current functioning—and 
this is true both for agent-directed trust and for non-agent-directed trust.

other agents and parts of our environments to facilitate our efforts to carry out our 
everyday life.
This account of trust is particularly fitting for extended mind theory and cogni-
tive integration. This is due to two different, but closely related, reasons. For one, 
what is normally taken to matter the relevant object of trust in these accounts is not 
so much the artifact itself but the information that is contained in the artifact (Clark 
& Chalmers, 1998; Clark, 2003; Heersmink, 2015; Smart, 2017).15 And as 
Heersmink (2015) and Smart (2017) take it, for a cognitive artifact to be integrated, 
the information needs not be blindly trusted, but it can be subjected to some degree 
of conscious evaluation, especially when it derives from a potentially but not-yet-­
integrated information source. In some cases, to refrain from questioning the infor-
mation entirely can be justified, and it is often the case in two-way or reciprocal 
integrated cognitive systems because of frequent use and the fact that the off-loaded 
information derives from the user herself. For instance, Otto always carries his note-
book wherever he goes, and he is the only input of the information that lies within 
it. However, when the possibility the artifact has been tampered with is set aside 
(see Sterelny, 2010), many cognitive artifacts with the potential for integration are 
shared with and reliably used by other agents, there may be no reason to actually 
question the reliability and truthfulness of the information. Arango-Muñoz (2013, 
147) points out as further reasons for explicit trust in externally sourced information 
are coherence (i.e., accordance with previous beliefs of the artifact’s user), consen-
sus (i.e., endorsement from a majority of people), intelligibility (i.e., how easy it is 
to understand the information), and relevance (i.e., how consistent it is with the 
agent’s goals). In general, trust in the information contained in a cognitive artifact 
can be grounded or justified in a wide variety of social and cognitive mechanisms 
that involve the agent’s own skills, competence and cognitive profile, as well as the 
characteristics of the artifact and of its use within the community the agent 
belongs to.
Facebook, understood as an information source, can be considered to enable a 
relatively high degree of trust for many of the aforementioned reasons. As we saw 
in section three, Facebook’s affordances enable a potentially high score in all dimen-
sions of integration. In general, the high degree of individualization and the high 
degree of “institutionalization” seem to already fulfill three of Arango-Muñoz’s 
conditions for trust. The information the user interacts with on the Newsfeed is 
either originated (and potentially visualizable) by members of her social network or 
provided by information sources that either she deliberately chose or that are 
15 To be precise, trust in 4E cognition literature is mostly understood as directed towards the infor-
mation, but this is not the case of all authors in this field. For instance, Schwengerer (2021, forth-
coming) applies the dimensions of integration of trust to the artifact as such, and not the information 
therein. We believe that this ambiguity can be ignored in the case of digital platforms when ana-
lyzed separately from the technologies used to access them (whether smartphones, tablets, etc.) 
The reason being that these platforms are constituted by bits of information that users can directly 
interact with (see Arfini et al., 2019). In other words, we believe that artifact and information are, 
for our purposes, virtually indistinguishable.

suggested to her by the platform’s algorithms. The high score in these two dimen-
sions enables trust in the information found due to agreement with (at least some) 
members of her social network and the coherence and relevance of the provided 
content—both due to the user’s deliberate or inferred preferences. The potentially 
high informational and procedural transparency contribute to the information’s 
intelligibility. Given the fact that users can access their profiles and Newsfeed 
through a password, trust can be further enhanced by the (theoretical) improbability 
of the profile’s tampering by other agents.
Additionally, the traditional understanding of trustworthiness of information is 
also not sufficient to conceptualize Facebook’s cognitive integration, because the 
information’s trustworthiness might not be relevant for at least some usages of the 
platform or some kinds of content that are available there. For example, when read-
ing jokes or looking at cat pictures on Facebook, there is no information that needs 
to be trusted in order for it to be enjoyed. Schwengerer (Forthcoming), who also 
follows Nguyen’s account of trust as an unquestioning attitude, explains there is still 
a different kind of trust at play. He is arguing that the user-friendliness of an arti-
fact—and specifically of websites and digital platforms—might prompt users to 
trust the information these artifacts contain even though the platform’s user-­
friendliness is not a justification for trusting that information as useful, reliable, or 
truthful.
The understanding of trust as an unquestioning attitude and a “cognitive grease” 
also fully fleshes out the intrinsic involvement of ignorance in cognitive integration. 
We have already mentioned before the idea of “tradeoff” that comes with the scaf-
folding of cognitive processes to extra cranial structures and artifacts. Trust, intended 
as an unquestioning attitude, can be understood as the primary enabler and manifes-
tation of this trade-off. The non-questioning of an artifact’s reliability and function-
ality in the practice it is used in can be considered as one of the most crucial aspects 
of the artifact’s overall cognitive integration: if the agent would question and doubt 
the artifact’s functioning while engaging with it, then the artifact could not be 
smoothly integrated within her agency, independently from how highly integrated it 
is with regards to other dimensions. In other words, questioning or doubting the 
artifact in specific instances of its function would impede a stable relation with the 
artifact. So trust, understood as an unquestioning attitude, is what enables not just 
cognitive integration but the institution of a knowledge-based habit in the artifact’s 
use. Based on the agent’s knowledge of the artifact’s functioning, she can engage in 
a habitual relation and not question such functioning. The more user-friendly the 
artifact is, the less sophisticated and rich the knowledge necessary for establishing 
the habit is going to be and the less effortful the payoff intrinsic to the artifact’s 
integration, and Facebook’s high user-friendliness favors this dynamic.
Trust in Facebook as an artifact can be then understood as a deliberate or wilful 
ignorance on the user’s side that is facilitated by the artifact’s user-friendliness and 
is necessary for its cognitive integration. That being said, when looking at the spe-
cific case of Facebook, we believe not only that the platform’s user-friendliness (i.e., 
its high scoring on all dimensions of integration except for trust) is fundamental to 
understand both the cognitive and wider social implications of Facebook as a

technology; rather, we believe that the trust in Facebook as an artifact that affords 
specific actions and attitudes is key to such understanding. And to bring this point 
forth clearly, we need to take into account the intentional design choices and values 
underlying Facebook’s design, and how these lead its users to trust the platform as 
a serviceable artifact in its entirety.16
The user-friendliness of Facebook—and the boost to trust in the platform—can 
also be seen in a more value-laden sense: as a technology, Facebook is incredibly 
user-focused. A novel Facebook user is invited by the platform’s interface to create 
her own social network and to set up her own preferences for presenting herself to 
the members of her online social network. In general, a Facebook user has the pos-
sibility to pick the information sources of her choice (as long as they are also on the 
platform). Facebook’s algorithms track the kinds of content that the user engages 
with and provide her with similar content to further encourage engagement. And the 
platform’s interface, giving the possibility to post “what’s on your mind,” to react to, 
comment, share, modify and overall engage with the content that presents itself on 
her Newsfeed. The platform’s interface, in other words, encourages—or nudges—
its user towards the consumption of information of her choice and towards the pos-
sibility of self-expression. The affordances of visibility and editability denote the 
platform’s focus on its user, as they signify the user’s capacity for making herself 
more or less visible to other users by producing, modifying, and tailoring her own 
posts, profile information, configuration and overall self-image, as well as for 
expanding the extent of her online social network and nudging members of her 
social network to consume specific (and self-produced) content through tagging. All 
of these affordances of Facebook’s interface point to the nudging of self-expression, 
self-tailored information consumption and self-presentation within one’s own social 
network—in other words, Facebook focuses entirely on the user’s own preference, 
own values and own self-image.
As Nelson (2018, see Chapters 4–5) points out, the way many mainstream social 
media platforms mediate the experience and decision-making processes of their 
users’ privileges the users’ own beliefs, desires, and values. This hyper-­
individualistic—almost solipsistic—focus of Facebook and social media sites not 
only leads to the overshadowing of other people and their perspectives while online 
(especially outside of the user’s social network) but is in fact so emphasized by the 
interface’s design to even favor self-deceptive practices (Dings, 2017). So, while 
social media technologies such as Facebook are advertised for information con-
sumption and social connection, both of these activities are—intentionally—
“tinged” through the lens of the users’ professed preferences, values and beliefs. 
However, such mediation is potentially less evident to users, due to the high degree 
of informational and procedural transparency that characterizes Facebook.
16 The assumption that artifacts can embody (moral) values is far from straightforward (Van de Poel 
& Kroes, 2014; Miller, 2021). The connection between artifact and values that we are proposing 
here is specifically in line with Klenk’s (2020) and Tollon’s (2021) recent proposals that artifacts 
can embody (moral) values because they afford certain (sets of) actions more than others.
7  Mind Invasion Through Cognitive Integration: Facebook and the Exploitati…

144
Importantly, the kind of trust that is enabled by the artifact’s integration within a 
knowledge-based habit has some specific emotive effects on the agent, which can be 
described as confidence. This affective state is intrinsically linked to trust and has 
two somewhat different connotations. On the one hand, as Arfini points out, central 
to the construction of a knowledge-based habit is the fact that the agent feels sure, 
certain, or confident regarding the veracity of her beliefs. In this sense, trusting the 
artifact entails (but is not identical to) the agent’s trust towards her own beliefs 
regarding the artifact, which make the agent confident and trusting towards the 
artifact.
On the other hand, the close-knit relation between trust from agent to artifact and 
the agent’s confidence in that artifact’s use is highlighted by Kiran and Verbeek 
(2010), who come to equate trust in artifacts with confidence as such. Their concep-
tualization starts with acknowledging that all technology mediates human relation-
ships with the world—and they do so by affording specific kinds of relations 
(agency, perception and experience) with the world and other people in value-laden 
ways. More specifically, technological artifacts re-structure human agency by high-
lighting specific aspects of the world the agent cares about. In this light, trusting an 
artifact means that its user can embrace and appropriate that artifact in her cognitive 
practices while recognizing the ways the artifact restructures her experience, atten-
tion, and concern in her relations with the world.
This appropriation and recognition is recognizable as a confidence in the agent 
that trusts the artifact, an affective state that leads users to feel her knowledge and 
agency to be well-grounded and, therefore, ignore the chance that her understanding 
of the artifact might be limited, despite the impression of clarity (Sect. 7.3.2), famil-
iarity (Sect. 7.3.3), and reliability (Sect. 7.3.1) that foster this confidence. This feel-
ing of confidence is more than likely what Facebook as a technology is designed to 
provide its users with. At the same time, this confidence is grounded with an incred-
ibly wide array of possible actions and relations with others and the world the plat-
form brings forth. Furthermore, the confidence in the artifact’s functioning also 
reinforces the user’s confidence and trust towards what she believes she knows 
about the artifact. Trust in the artifacts is what gives epistemological grounding to 
the knowledge-based habitual Facebook use that is closely related to most of the 
other dimensions of integration. And while Kiran and Verbeek’s account is sketched 
to capture “good”—i.e., well-grounded, justified, and ultimately accountable—trust 
in technology, Facebook can foster this feeling of trust because it is designed to be 
appropriated by its users—by creating a personalized profile, establishing preferred 
connections and information sources, and privilege the expression of the user’s 
thoughts and values. If users only take into account Facebook as an artifact, what is 
afforded to them, then their trust appears justified; it is only once the non-visible 
role of the service provider is taken into account that their confidence appears 
ill-grounded.
Overall, to conclude this section, trust in Facebook as both a specific information 
source and as a social and cognitive artifact has the potential to score very high. This 
analysis, coupled with the association of the other dimensions of integration and

Facebook affordances that we examined in Sect. 7.3, gives us the picture of an arti-
fact with a very high degree of cognitive integration that also aims at empowering 
users’ expressivity, communication and intersubjectivity in a digitally mediated 
manner. Furthermore, trust in Facebook, understood as an unquestioning attitude 
and a form of technologically boosted confidence, is the primary hinge of the cogni-
tive trade-off typical of cognitive integration. Specifically, trusting an artifact means 
to not question it and to ignore the functioning of the artifact while it partakes in a 
person’s actions, to the point that the artifact itself becomes a necessary grounding 
for those actions to be carried out—a grounding which can be ignored, at least to an 
extent, for smooth and functional agency to be carried out. We now turn to the other 
side of the coin: we will now analyze how this integration leads to a high vulnerabil-
ity of the user towards the platform’s designers and how the latter achieve their aim 
thanks to Facebook users using the platform in the manner designers intended. To 
explore this vulnerability in-depth, it is necessary to start with some considerations 
regarding the kind of trust we have not yet explored. Specifically, we now turn to 
explicate the “trust” characterizing the relation between Facebook users and the 
platform’s designers, and how such trust—or, better put, lack of attention and ques-
tioning—towards the service providers arises to begin with.
7.5  Digital Technologies and Manipulative Design: 
The Hidden Intentions of Platform Designers
So far, the discussion of cognitive integration was intended to highlight the specific 
relation between the cognitive artifact and the individual cognitive system that 
makes use of and interacts with said artifact. However, in order to understand the 
ethical and epistemological implications of such cognitive integration in the case of 
Facebook, we believe it necessary to take into account the designer of the artifact. 
The specific dynamic between (1) the artifact’s user, (2) the artifact’s design, and (3) 
the artifact’s designer needs to be examined: Specifically, we intend to account for 
how the designer is in a condition of superiority with regard to the user through the 
way Facebook is designed. In order to describe this relation, we will make use of 
Jared Parmer’s (Forthcoming) notion of manipulative design.
Parmer introduces this notion in order to explain the somewhat sinister aspects of 
certain digital platforms and apps that use gamification (i.e., the introduction of 
game-like features) in order to make their users feel more stimulated and rewarded 
while having access to a service these platforms provide. The app Duolingo, for 
instance, is designed for language learning: Its users complete exercises to gain 
“experience points,” reach different “crown levels,” and achieving “badges,” while 
competing with other users on a weekly leaderboard with an in-game coin prize and 
the chance of further customizing one’s own profile. Parmer describes the attitude 
underlying the use of these apps as striving play: the users of these apps are not just 
enjoying the game-like features of the platform as ends in themselves, for they

146
intend to “play” for a broader purpose, such as learning a language and cultivating 
good habits.17 Indeed, the introduction of game-like features by these platforms is 
meant to make these broader goals more enjoyable and immediately desirable 
to people.
However, Parmer points out, while the gamification of otherwise somewhat bur-
densome activities are perceived as enjoyable and is not inherently negative, in the 
case of many digital platforms, gamification constitutes a design choice intended to 
hide some more underhanded aspects. Case in point, Duolingo used to make a profit 
by selling the translations performed by its users to third parties (Shah, 2019); and 
while, on the one hand, they were open about this business model (von Ahn, 2013) 
and, on the other hand, Duolingo has abandoned it (von Ahn, 2017), when they 
declared this business model, the app had already acquired approximately five mil-
lion active users and a reputation for being a well-working and free app for language 
learning.
This is an instance of manipulative design, whereby the artifact fulfills the 
user’s goal while enabling the designer to reach a further goal that presupposes 
functional use—a goal that users are often unaware of. The user has a specific 
goal, such as learning a language, and the artifact is designed to achieve that goal. 
The designer’s goal partially coincides with the user’s, but has a divergent end. 
Duolingo’s designers intend to gain a profit by selling the translations performed 
by the app’s users to third parties: however, in order to achieve the goal they need 
the app’s users to successfully perform the language learning exercises; and, for 
users to complete the exercises, the app itself needs to be functional in fulfilling 
the user’s desire—learning a language through exercises. In other words, while the 
designer’s goal ultimately differs from the user’s, its achievement presupposes the 
user’s goal to be achieved—and the artifact is functional for fulfilling both of the 
agents’ goals, despite the fact that the former may not even be aware of the latter’s 
intentions.
It is important to underline, along with Parmer, that it is thanks to the well-­
functioning of the artifact in question that manipulative design can have its effect. 
An app such as Duolingo, marketed and used as a tool for easy and efficient lan-
guage learning, will keep its user’s focus on the app as such. If the app works well, 
the user will not tendentially be concerned with the service provider, or question 
their reliability. For instance, if one were to buy a hammer at a hardware store and 
the hammer works well—i.e., it does what it’s supposed to—the hammer’s user will 
not be concerned regarding the hardware storeman. In contrast, were the hammer to 
break down, its user may question not just the functionality of the tool, but also the 
reliability of the store where they bought it. Put shortly: as long as the artifact does 
what it’s designed to do, its user will not be concerned with the artifact’s manufac-
turer, designer or seller. This is of the most important implication of the specific 
power relations between designer, user, and artifact characterizing manipulative 
17 While much of Parmer’s reflections are dedicated to gamification and how that is a relevant con-
tributing factor for many instances of (digitally based) manipulative design to occur, we choose to 
not integrate this topic within this chapter to maintain our primary focus.

design: as long as the artifact works as it’s supposed to, the user generally will not 
question the designer’s capabilities or underlying intentions. And while this might 
stand true for any artifact, the implications for digital technologies such as Duolingo 
are significant.
This, we believe, is the kind of relationship between a Facebook user, Facebook 
itself and Facebook’s designers. A Facebook user intends to generate content about 
herself, her own thoughts and values and consume information about others and the 
world; she also might want to create and cultivate a social network constituted by 
her friends, family members, and acquaintances. Facebook is, after all, a social 
networking site and can be said to fulfill this purpose well. However, its designers 
have the goal of gaining user data, the information that users produce, engage with, 
and leave traces of while online (Hildebrandt, 2006, 2008, 2012). This practice is 
motivated by the possibility to gain a profit by selling this information to third par-
ties. So Facebook, too, is an artifact with a manipulative design. However, 
Facebook’s functionality is not limited to a specific activity such as Duolingo is: it 
affords a much wider range of activities. The cognitive, epistemic, emotional, and 
experiential impact of Facebook is much more significant than it would be for more 
specifically focused apps.
The manipulative design of Facebook is also what threads together the cognitive 
integration enabled by an artifact’s affordances, the kinds of (somewhat inevitable) 
ignorance that such integration entails and the exploitation and epistemic injustice 
that results in this integration. For if every niche’s (or, here, every artifact’s) affor-
dances lead to cognitive confinement and ignorance as a form of selective attention 
in the case of artifacts with a manipulative design, this confinement (or at least 
attempt at) can be considered as deliberate on the side of the service provider. As we 
foreshadowed in Sect. 7.2, this kind of confinement represents an instance where 
ignorance as the inevitable result of selective attention and as the result of a strategic 
ploy overlap. Facebook is designed to maintain users’ attention and interest dictated 
by the affordances of the platform through its user-friendliness and overall high 
integrability. Its design can be considered as the result of the service providers’ 
intentions (therefore of a strategy) and, at the same time, as an inevitable state that 
characterizes engagement with affordances of any kind. In this context, it is in the 
service providers’ interests to keep the platform’s users ignorant regarding the for-
mer’s presence and goals, and this state of ignorance is importantly achieved by 
designing an artifact that does what it’s promoted to do in a user-friendly, reliable, 
clear, and often enjoyable manner. In other words, Facebook’s manipulative design 
exploits the inevitable ignorance of selective attention and cognitive integration to 
implement and maintain a production of ignorance in users, by keeping them in the 
dark as much as possible regarding the designers’ goals and gains in the plat-
form’s use.

7.6  Mind Invasion Through Manipulative Design: Exploiting 
Users’ Ignorance in the Emotional 
Contagion Experiment
So far, we have taken the cognitive integration of Facebook as a matter of human–
technology relation: we have examined how Facebook is an artifact that fulfills a 
user’s needs or goals. It is now time that we add the last ingredient to the mix: the 
role of the platform’s designers or service providers. This role is unprecedented 
when compared to the typical artifacts examined in 4E cognition literature. To use 
the example mentioned at the very beginning of the chapter, once the stationary 
shop owner sells Otto his notebook, she slides out of the picture: she does not par-
ticipate in Otto’s cognitive practices in any relevant sense, if not for providing him 
with the artifact in question. She furthermore has no interest in how the artifact is 
even used, let alone in Otto’s information processing behavior: as long as the note-
book is sold, her goal is fulfilled and she plays no further role in Otto’s use of it. It 
is in this regard that digital platforms like Facebook stand out: for in these cases, the 
user’s information processing behavior and actual use of the artifact is extremely 
close to the designer’s own interests. Through a rather notorious example, we now 
show not only how the designer is implicitly present in the user–Facebook relation, 
but also how this presence denotes a power relation between the user and the 
designer through the medium of the platform. Thanks to their ignorance, users’ 
thoughts and affect on Facebook are capitalized upon by committing a form of her-
meneutical injustice with potentially dangerous implications for users’ autonomy.
But what do we mean by talking about the presence of the service provider in the 
case of Facebook? As we mentioned, the aim of the service provider is, first and 
foremost, the gathering of user data to be sold to third parties. This is possible 
thanks to the mechanism described by Burr et al. (2018) that we mentioned in Sect. 
7.3.4. On the one hand, the algorithms that constantly provide new information to 
Facebook users are the enablers of a reciprocal information flow, whereby the user’s 
(more or less conscious) choices in engagement lead to a similar content provided 
by the algorithm to further favor engagement. On the other hand, the core of this 
mechanism is the algorithms acting not just as content providers but as engagement 
observers. The content deemed appropriate to individual users is based on the algo-
rithms’ capacity to track what content users engage with and to infer what content 
they might want to further engage with, based on previously observed behavior. 
This practice is known as profiling (Hildebrandt, 2006, 2008, 2012) and lies at the 
core of the business model of many different web-based platforms, Facebook 
included. And it is through this practice, factually carried out by the platform’s algo-
rithms, that the service provider can be said to be present throughout the entire time 
people use a platform like Facebook. The service provider—and platform designer—
is present in the sense that the platform is designed to continuously accumulate 
information regarding its users that the service provider can then use or sell. And 
crucially, this presence is invisible to the user, for they do not see the service pro-
vider observing them, but they simply interact with the platform as an artifact—and 
G. Figà Talamanca and E. Hunting

149
if the service provider would be perceived as actually there, Facebook users might 
behave very differently, or not use the platform at all.
Highlighting the role of the service provider also helps illustrate how the plat-
form’s design can be said to be manipulative in the sense highlighted in Sect. 7.4. 
From the user’s perspective, Facebook is a means to consume and produce content 
to be shared with one’s online social network, all the while maintaining and possi-
bly extending that social network by connecting and communicating with its mem-
bers—friends, family, and so on. However, the goal of the designer is to gather data 
regarding the platform’s users in order to make a profit out of it. But to achieve this 
goal, the service provider needs the platform’s users to make use of the artifact—
and the most efficient way to make it happen is to make the artifact suitable not only 
for the designer’s goals, but for the users’ goals, too. Facebook as a platform is then 
designed to catch two birds with one stone, for enabling its users to consume and 
share information and for the service provider to collect user data. And this is pos-
sible because (1) the service provider’s goal overlaps (but does not coincide) with 
the platform users’, as by means of manipulative design; and (2) while the service 
provider is present through the algorithmic activity of the platform, users do not see 
them present as an agent; and (3) because the platform fulfills users’ goals well 
enough, they have no clear motivation to question what the service provider is get-
ting out of it. More than trusting the service provider because the artifact is trusted, 
we believe that users, because the artifact does what it is supposed to do, usually 
ignore the service provider’s presence and possible goals; and as long as the artifact 
does what it’s supposed to (from the user’s perspective), there is no need to think 
about the service provider at all.
This picture is further enriched once we keep in mind that these technologies are 
deeply integrated. For manipulative design can occur with technologies that are not 
necessarily cognitive integrated: Duolingo, which is one of Parmer’s primary exam-
ples of technologies with a manipulative design, is user-friendly, but not necessarily 
as integrated within as many cognitive practices as Facebook is.18 The fact that 
Facebook is a deeply integrated artifact and flies under the user’s radar of awareness 
has uncanny implications for the autonomy and the vulnerability of people using it. 
It exacerbates the implications of the platform’s manipulative design to a currently 
under-examined extent.
We now make a case for the implications of deep cognitive integration of this 
kind of technology, which intrinsically involves a structural ignorance of its users, 
by examining one example of unethical data-gathering practices conducted by 
Facebook’s service providers. The example we have in mind is the Emotional 
Contagion Experiment (henceforth ECE). In 2014, Facebook conducted a massive-­
scale experiment on the platform involving almost 700,000 people to determine 
whether deliberate changes in the individual Newsfeeds would affect the emotional 
18 For instance, while Duolingo might be procedurally and informationally transparent, its func-
tionality does not depend on other people using it, information flow is two-way and not reciprocal, 
it does not leave the same amount of room for individualization as an artifact like Otto’s notebook 
or Facebook does.

state of users. Specifically, Kramer et  al. (2014) investigated whether providing 
users with negatively or positively charged posts in their Newsfeed (for the duration 
of a week) would lead to users producing content whose emotional tone would cor-
respond to the posts in general. The results were pretty clear, for the predictions 
were confirmed in full—with the authors concluding that emotional contagion 
within a social network is indeed possible.
The experiment received strong criticisms from the research community, so 
much so that the article is now preceded by an Editorial Expression of Concern 
regarding the (lack of) explicit consent from the platform’s users. This is also the 
main problem that researchers criticized ECE for (Deterding, 2014; Grimmelmann, 
2014a, b), even though the authors claimed that the experiment was consistent with 
Facebook’s Data Use Policy—which is, technically, agreed upon by users once they 
register on the platform. While this is an extremely problematic aspect of the experi-
ment, we want to focus our attention on two issues. The first is prominently brought 
forth by Selinger and Hartzog (2016), while the second is best explained by intro-
ducing and adding to the existing definition of hermeneutical injustice by Fricker 
(2007, 2016).
Let’s start with Selinger and Hartzog’s (2016) concerns. They argue that one of 
the primary problems of the ECE is the way Facebook as a company (i.e., a service 
provider) did not care for the users’ lack of control in online information disclosure. 
Specifically, in the technologically mediated social environment of Facebook, users 
have little control over how and to whom the content they produce will appear: they 
can control what they are going to post but not how that content will appear or be 
further used. In the case of ECE, Facebook made use of users’ posts for experimen-
tal purposes not only without their consent but without the users possibly imagining 
that the content they generated would be used for a purpose so divergent from their 
original intention. They were at an epistemological disadvantage that the service 
provider could not have been unaware of. They especially did so by taking advan-
tage of the way people have little control of the content they posted, and both the 
recipients and consumers of that information are vulnerable to re-purposed use of 
that content. And users are particularly vulnerable to content re-appropriation by 
third parties not simply due to a relative lack of control over information, but also 
because the platform has access to all the possible choices and expressions of indi-
vidual users. “In short, Facebook constructs a phenomenologically limited environ-
ment where what users see and experience does not prepare them to critically assess 
all of the relevant ways their identities are being distributed and reconstituted” 
(41)—and this limitedness is a result of the platform’s artifactual nature: a medium 
with a wide variety of affordances that nonetheless pre-determine users’ interac-
tions with information, others, and themselves.
This epistemic disadvantage is, on the one hand, understandable as a state of 
ignorance in Facebook users resulting from a strategic ploy. A notorious example of 
this socially generated ignorance is the way the tobacco industry tried to maintain 
people ignorant regarding the dangers of smoking by contesting available evidence 
on the matter (Proctor, 2008). In contrast, Facebook’s service providers achieve this 
through the platform’s manipulative design, which nudges users to not be concerned

with the service provider’s interests and goals. On the other hand, it is through this 
epistemic disadvantage and state of ignorance that Facebook’s designers are in a 
position to perpetrate a form of hermeneutical injustice (Fricker, 2007, 2016) 
towards the platform’s users. This kind of injustice usually occurs when the experi-
ences of discriminated groups of people are not well understood by themselves or 
others. This systematic misunderstanding is enabled by a lack of conceptual 
resources to explain these experiences of discrimination, typically due to historical 
exclusion of some people in, for example, journalism or academia, which are impor-
tant places when it comes to shaping the language to express and explain experi-
ences. For example, in the late 1960s, when a woman was sexually harassed at 
work, she felt all kinds of upsetting emotions, but she could not put into words what 
was happening to her. Describing the emotions on their own was not enough to do 
justice to her experiences. She could not explain it to herself or others, because there 
was no generalized awareness of this phenomenon. Women and their experiences 
were barely present in journalism, law, or other institutions that could help people 
understand the injustices they experienced, because there were no socially shared 
conceptual resources to frame these systemic injustices as such.
Facebook users come from all walks of life and, in this sense, they are not part of 
a group in society that is discriminated against in the same manner the groups 
Fricker refers to (e.g., women and minorities) are. However, Facebook users can be 
said to be made into targets of hermeneutical injustice with regard to one specific 
domain. Fricker (2016) gives an example from Ian McEwan’s novel Enduring Love 
(1998) in order to illustrate how hermeneutic injustice can occur when one specific 
domain of knowledge is involved. Joe, the novel’s main character, is an educated, 
white, middle-class man, which means he usually is not hermeneutically marginal-
ized, except for one area. He is being non-violently stalked. When he goes to the 
police, he attempts and fails to communicate effectively what is happening to him. 
There is literally no box to tick on the police forms for the crime he is a victim of. 
Facebook users are subjected to the same lack of conceptual resources as Joe is. 
They experience certain emotions, without knowing what they mean or what caused 
them. Moreover, they might not even realize that the emotions they experienced 
were induced to begin with. Users are purposefully kept in the dark about the mate-
rial settings of their experiences and the implications of their behavior online for 
other people and, more importantly, the service provider. The platform, taken as a 
mere artifact, does not offer its users the conceptual resources to realize the circum-
stances they are in. The epistemic disadvantage that Facebook’s designers place 
users in are hidden, and especially the fact that their behavior is under constant 
observation by the designers and can be used for the latter’s financial gain. The ECE 
epitomizes this state of epistemic disadvantage in users, reached through the plat-
form’s cognitive integration and manipulative design, by showing that users are 
subject to a form of hermeneutical injustice when it comes to understanding how the 
thoughts they share can be put to use by Facebook’s designers.
The links between the platform’s socio-material characteristics, user vulnerabil-
ity and ignorance are key here, and the high degree of cognitive integration of the 
artifact within users’ actions illustrates it very clearly. Cognitive integration, here,

entails that the boundaries between Facebook and users blur when users are using 
the platform; and when looking at Facebook as a “mere” artifact, and ignoring the 
possible goals of the service provider, its functionality and ease in use provide suf-
ficient reasons to trust the artifact. The high degree of integration of Facebook as an 
artifact is then instrumental for opaque and potentially unethical practices involving 
data collection and redistribution on the service provider’s side. Through the inte-
gration of Facebook into users’ cognitive practices, the service provider is able to 
perpetrate a form of hermeneutical injustice that reaches the core of users’ cognition 
and decision-making processes, and that can be characterized as an instance of mind 
invasion.
This term was introduced by Slaby (2016) to criticize the assumption typical of 
4E cognition19 that he calls the “user/resource model,” whereby “a fully conscious 
individual cognizer … sets about pursuing a well-defined task through intentional 
employment of a piece of equipment or exploitation of an environmental structure” 
(5). This assumption not only pictures the agent as in exclusive control of the task 
and of their state of mind: in a sense, this picture is still too conservative because it 
ignores how the agent’s task and state of mind can actually be co-constituted by 
their environment to begin with. When one abandons the picture of the cognitive 
agent as independent from their environment and starts seeing the user’s cognitive 
capacity, decision-making processes, and autonomy in strict relation to those exter-
nal structures, it becomes much clearer to see that scaffolding information, affect, 
and action to the socio-material environment comes with an inherent vulnerability. 
And these socio-material structures that aid cognitive processes are often “deliber-
ately machinated so as to help the given [social scaffold] reach its operative goal” (8).
Taking as an example the corporate workplace and its social and material scaf-
fold—which includes the way the office within a building is organized, the hierar-
chical relation between employers and employees and the subsequent power 
relations within the workplace—Slaby makes the case for cognitive scaffolds not 
only putting agents in a relation of dependence to those structures but also in a con-
dition of susceptibility to other agents and social dynamics that occur within it. 
These dynamics and relations are never entirely under the individual’s total control, 
and yet are co-constitutive for achieving their goals and for their decision-making 
processes within the workplace. In this context,
[f]eelings of guilt, of responsibility, various fears, and anxieties are part and parcel of this 
near-ubiquitous constellation [i.e., the workplace as a socio-material cognitive niche] but 
also the excitement of connection, the thrill of being part of the action as it unfolds … [i]t 
is this rampant blend of feelings and affective tendencies that characterised the contempo-
rary dispositive of white-collar work in developed society (10).
Importantly, the influence of socio-material settings into one’s affective state is also 
linked to the possibility of hermeneutical injustice. For instance, if sexual 
19 He specifically elaborates this notion in relation to the debate regarding situated affectivity and 
affective scaffolding (see e.g., Griffiths & Scarantino, 2008; Colombetti & Krueger, 2015; 
Saarinen, 2020).

153
harassment occurs systematically within a workplace, it may become generally 
accepted within those settings as normal, with the consequence that those suffering 
from the harassment would become unable to recognize it as unjust due to a lack of 
shared conceptual resources within that environment. The idea of mind invasion, in 
short, proposes the idea that, while the cognitive scaffolding and integration of 
extracranial items is a natural tendency of human beings as agents, it also comes 
with a varying degree of vulnerability towards those very socio-material structures 
and other agents that participate within them.
With this background in mind, we find it uncontroversial to say that the cognitive 
integration of Facebook within its users’ practices leads to their susceptibility to 
mind invasion. The ECE is a prime example of this dynamic: people made use of 
Facebook as an artifact very adaptable and cognitively integrable to their informa-
tion consumption behavior and social goals. The ECE, then, constitutes a case of 
mind invasion in terms of the actual experimental practice: the insertion of emotion-
ally charged content within users’ Newsfeeds affected those users’ affective state 
and decision-making processes by taking advantage of their ignorance and the inte-
gration of the artifact. This is, quite literally, the scenario we sketched in the intro-
ductory section of the chapter: if we would go as far as taking the integrated artifact 
as part of the agent’s mind in the same way as Otto’s notebook is part of Otto’s, then 
the ECE is tantamount to inserting into Otto’s notebook information in order to 
influence him to act in certain ways. The invasion of users’ minds occurred, first and 
foremost, in the sense that the experiment in itself took advantage of the intrinsic 
vulnerability of the agent integrating an extra-cranial structure into their cognitive 
practices.
There is, however, a more uncanny aspect to seeing Facebook as enabling mind 
invasion: for if the ECE is an example of mind invasion through the insertion of 
emotionally charged posts into users’ Newsfeed for experimental purposes, the 
same can be said for the data collection practices (i.e., profiling) conducted by 
Facebook as a service provider. The invasion of the user’s integrated cognitive sys-
tem might not appear as blatant in this case: for in the ECE, Facebook invaded 
users’ cognitive practices by deliberately inserting content within their Newsfeed. 
In contrast, the acquisition of user data needs no active involvement from the ser-
vice provider: rather, Facebook as an agent within the cognitive and affective socio-­
material structure can acquire user data because users use Facebook as an artifact. 
Because it affords and constrains possible actions for its users, actions that involve 
information production, consumption, and the maintenance of social ties; and 
through the algorithms that underlie the interface’s functioning, as well as provide 
content on the Newsfeed and infer further content based on users’ previous 
choices—Facebook as a service provider is able to remain hidden to users’ aware-
ness while still being in a position of power toward those users. The hiddenness and 
power relation of the service provider is a result of the manipulative design of the 
platform: the service provider’s goal presupposes the user’s achieving theirs, and 
the platform is meant to make the user’s goal and the designer’s as comfortably 
achievable as possible. However, the cognitive integration of this technology con-
textualizes this power relation significantly: for the service provider, thanks to the

cognitive integration of the artifact, is not simply observing users’ behavior but is 
capable of observing the very core of users’ cognitive processing up close. User 
data collection by Facebook constitutes an invasion of the mind because the service 
provider, while not necessarily interfering with users’ affective states—like in the 
case of ECE—is in a position of effectively observing the user’s mind, potentially 
even beyond the user’s own capacities.20
To see Facebook as a cognitive artifact that enables mind invasion has some 
notable consequences in the kind of concerns we, as a society, should approach 
these technologies with. For it is not particularly uncontroversial that practices such 
ECE can be deemed immoral; however, when it comes to data collecting practices 
such as profiling, our analysis gives a generally worrying picture. Our concern, 
already moved by Selinger and Hartzog (2016) is more clearly spelled out by 
Jongepier and Wieland (Forthcoming) in their analysis of political micro-targeting 
on social media, i.e., the collection and analysis of people’s personal data to send 
them tailored political messages (Zarouali et al., 2020). They specifically argue that, 
in many instances, political micro-targeting is immoral because such practice fails 
to treat its targets as mere means, i.e., without caring for their consent for this kind 
of use of data. The use of personal data for political micro-targeting, in other words, 
fails to treat its targets as moral agents with vulnerabilities; instead, the platform 
(for instance, Facebook) that gathers those data and then sell them to third parties 
(that can then micro-target users based on those data) treats its users as mere infor-
mation sources. And when one frames this picture with the fact that the digital 
platforms where user data collection occurs are also highly integrated within users’ 
cognitive and social practices online, then one can say that service providers are not 
simply treating people as mere means. 
Our analysis of Facebook through the lens of cognitive integration leads to an 
unsettling reconsideration of the power social media platforms exercise over people 
and of the need for safeguarding people’s relationships with highly integrated arti-
facts. Carter and Palermos (2016) argued that, because digital technologies can be 
deeply integrated with people’s cognitive processing to the point of being consid-
ered part of their own minds, accessing them without consent would be comparable 
to physical or psychological harm and can be seen as a form of personal assault—
specifically “extended personal assault” (549). This parallel, they argue, should 
ground legislation and policies dealing with these technologies. Our analysis also 
looked at the human natural reliance on cognitive artifacts for their everyday life, 
but contrary to Carter and Palermos, we took into account how these technologies 
are designed with specific corporate interests in mind—and our conclusions are 
even more sinister. Not only that, we took into account how the integration of 
Facebook (taken as a paradigmatic example of contemporary cognitive digital 
20 We take this possibility to be realistic not only because self-knowledge is not a transparent and 
straightforward endeavor for people (Cassam, 2014, 2017). Rather, because the platform’s algo-
rithms work not just to observe what content users consume and engage with, but also to infer what 
they might want to engage with, it is possible that they provide content users did not know they 
liked until it was presented to them.

technology) heavily hinges on its users’ ignorance, which, while an intrinsic aspect 
of cognitive integration, can make people more vulnerable from external and unkind 
influence. Our analysis paves the way for future research in reckoning how our natu-
ral reliance on external structures and artifacts for our cognitive processes and 
lives  can be taken advantage of by technologies designed to be as tightly and 
smoothly integrated as possible. The way our cognitive agency is scaffolded within 
the world (whether it be through an artifact, other agents, or institutions) is not just 
a matter of individual, private interests. As Heath and Anderson (2010) point out, it 
is a matter of public interest, whereby the functionality and implications of cogni-
tive practices are affected by social and material structures, and such interrelation 
entails a vulnerability on the part of people when their autonomy is not fostered and 
or at the very least respected. The entanglement of cognitive agency and relational-
ity with the world should prompt what Slaby (2016) calls a “political philosophy of 
mind” (11), a study of the relation between cognitive processing and the social and 
political structures whereby they take place. Our diagnosis strongly points in this 
direction, but it is merely scratching the surface when it comes to realizing how a 4E 
approach can heighten our understanding of digital platforms and their ramifica-
tions for our lives.
7.7  Conclusion
In this chapter, we investigated the social and practical implications of the integra-
tion of Facebook as a cognitive technology and came to consider this platform as an 
artifact whose cognitive integrability is a means to exploitative ends. With digital 
platforms such as Facebook, the danger is not simply that the use of these technolo-
gies would have negative epistemic consequences such as a lack of critical reflec-
tion (Carr, 2011; Lynch, 2016). Rather, these technologies are designed to be 
comfortably integrated into everyday cognitive practices—for ends that, while hid-
den to the people using these technologies, have unethical implications for them. By 
taking advantage of the state of ignorance that comes with cognitive integration and 
the interaction with any kind of affordances, technologies like Facebook aim, in a 
sense, to capitalize on people’s minds: Their design is custom made to be easily 
integrated and is comparable to a trap.
Much of our investigation relied on tracking the different kinds of ignorance that 
characterize the cognitive integration of Facebook, and the manner this integration 
is tightly coupled to Facebook’s users’ epistemic disadvantage vis-à-vis the plat-
form’s designers. On the one hand, Facebook users are subjected to ignorance as a 
natural consequence of interacting with a set of affordances and of integrating an 
extracranial structure within an agent’s cognitive practices. This kind of ignorance, 
understood as a cognitive confinement resulting from selective attention, enables the 
habitual integration of Facebook within everyday life and, largely thanks to the 
artifact’s user-friendliness, contributes to trust in the platform, and unquestioning 
and confident Facebook use. On the other hand,  however, as highlighted in the

discussion of Facebook’s manipulative design, the ignorance that comes with the 
platform’s habitual use is also taken advantage of by the service providers to com-
mit a systematic invasion of users’ minds. By depriving Facebook’s users of readily 
available conceptual resources for understanding what are the service providers’ 
goals, and what user-generated content is used for, Facebook’s service providers 
place their users in a position of epistemic disadvantage that enables the perpetra-
tion of a hermeneutical injustice. In other words, the unavoidable ignorance that 
comes with integrating artifacts in our everyday life is taken advantage of by invading 
our minds, examining our innermost thoughts and desires and treat them as currency.

Institutions as Cognitive Niches: 
A Dynamic of Knowledge and Ignorance
Konrad Werner
Abstract  Institutions have become fashionable. There is a growing field of institu-
tional economics, as well as more abstract studies of institutions undertaken by 
socio-ontology. People have also recognized a morally troubling side of institutions, 
having to do with institutionalized (or systemic) racism or inequality. Two accounts 
of institutions are usually distinguished in the literature: institutions-as-rules and 
institutions-as-equilibria. I am not about to argue that these views are wrong, 
although I portray them as insufficient. Instead, institutions shall be characterized as 
products of certain situated, embodied cognitive endeavors – as cognitive niches. 
The latter’s purpose is to ease some aspects of our cognitive functioning, but first of 
all to render the world around us cognitively available. The role of ignorance as a 
constitutive ingredient of the cognitive niche is elicited, with references to relevant 
literature. I propose that within cognitive niches, ignorance has a somewhat para-
doxical role of producing practical knowledge. With the latter in mind, I argue that 
institutions, conceived of as cognitive niches, also bring forth such knowledge-from-­
ignorance compounds at a higher level of social complexity, based on certain pat-
terns of behavior and fixed infrastructural factors. Finally, institutions differ in terms 
of how much they succeed or fail in the task of making certain entities available 
as goods.

This chapter provides a provisional formulation of a relatively new grasp of how 
institutions have to do with knowledge, ignorance and cognition more broadly. In 
short, institutions shall be portrayed as developments of so-called cognitive niches,

thus, from a locative point of view, as specific loci – realms or places making access 
to certain resources or goods possible by lowering the costs of accessing the latter 
for individuals. From a more dynamic perspective, they are clusters of processes of 
cognitive niche construction.
Institutions, when conceived of as developments of cognitive niches, have at 
least a two-fold relationship with the phenomenon of ignorance. First, they exist in 
principle to decrease ignorance and thus open up a possibility of getting access to 
resources. Here, the fundamental thing is that only as part of an institution/cognitive 
niche, the resources in question are known to individuals, and thus only within that 
structure accessing them in an option. Yet, secondly, institutions as cognitive niches 
are themselves grounded in a certain kind of ignorance (I’ll call it emergent igno-
rance), and as such, they have a somewhat paradoxical capacity to build knowledge 
from that ignorance. Actually, I argue that the notion of knowledge-from-ignorance 
gives us a deeper understanding of what the cognitive niche in general is, and there-
fore also a better grasp of the specificity of institutions as high-level cognitive niches.
The kind of reflection on institutions put forward here has not been tried out in 
the literature, therefore this chapter is dedicated to introducing the reader to a cer-
tain broad research project. I will proceed in the following order. First, the concept 
of institution is introduced following the existing literature. Second, the concepts of 
niche and, in particular, the cognitive niche are introduced. Third, the role of igno-
rance in cognitive niche construction is emphasized and scrutinized in greater detail. 
Fourth, institutions are portrayed as specific developments of cognitive niches, with 
a special emphasis being put, again, on the role of ignorance and the idea of 
knowledge-from-ignorance.
8.2  Institutions – Two Conceptions
Over the last 30 years or so, institutions have become fashionable. There is a grow-
ing field of new institutional economics (based on some older ideas by Weber, 1910; 
Coase, 1937, among others; see, e.g., Ostrom, 1990, 2005; Greif, 1998; Hodgson, 
2006; Kingston & Caballero, 2009), as well as more abstract studies of institutions 
undertaken by socio-ontology (e.g., Guala, 2016; Hindriks & Guala, 2015, 2019). It 
even became sort of a cliché that “institutions are important.” Although there is a 
certain default position adopted by most economists, there is no consensus as to 
what institutions are and where they come from (e.g., should they be targeted as 
products or local bottom-up evolution or rather top-down planning and policy mak-
ing?). I shall start by quickly running through the two most frequently cited concep-
tions, the first of which is clearly prevailing at least among economists, in order to 
provide a background against which I’ll try to roll an in principle different view.
According to the first view, as Douglass North (1990) famously puts it, institu-
tions are “the rules of the game of society or, more formally, the humanly devised 
constraints” that “establish a stable structure to human interaction” (North, 1990: 
6). This is supposed to mean that they impose a certain normative structure on our

behavior, especially economic activities such as production, trade, consumption, 
contracts, etc. For example, there is an institution called property rights which is 
proven crucial for the economic growth in a longer run (see, e.g., Acemoglu & 
Robinson, 2013), yet is also quite controversial (see, e.g., Chang, 2011).
There are several problems with this conception. Here I just mention those I find 
crucial from the cognitive angle. So, an implicit assumption behind North’s view is 
the dichotomy between rules and behavior which makes it difficult to account for, 
first, how rules can emerge from cognition and agency, and second – how rules can 
either succeed or fail in regulating behavior. Beginning with the latter, some eco-
nomic historians wonder why it is the case that mere import of certain institutions-­
as-­rules, for example property rights or anticorruption laws from developed 
countries to underdeveloped countries, does not foster economic progress in the 
latter (see Chang, 2011). The import simply doesn’t play out well for those sub-
jected to new regulations. A quite intuitive answer is that institutions cannot be 
transplanted from one social and cultural background to another, and this is likely 
true. Yet, if we stick with the rule-following account, there is no way to do justice to 
this intuition: These rules are portrayed as highly abstract and thus, in principle, 
implementable everywhere, just like the laws of geometry are universally valid. But 
if so, why is it the case that the implementation of rules does not always go smoothly 
and does not always yield desirable results? The only thing a rule-following 
approach can say about it is that certain rules just don’t sink in, which means that 
certain societies refuse to really take them to their hearts and, at some point, just 
create legal fictions (such as property rights in authoritarian regimes which are actu-
ally able to strip everybody of their property). This is why the view is called “rule-­
following,” for it is based on this clear-cut distinction: either you follow the rule or 
you don’t, there is nothing else you can do. This is, however, a way-too-simplified 
view of cognition, which ignores the fact that rules are given rise as part of the pur-
suit of solving specific problems existing in specific, local environments. I shall 
develop the latter idea in the following sections.
Another source of the term “rule-following,” distant but worth mentioning for 
the reasons to be clear shortly, is the debate that was going on especially in the 
1980s in the semantics of natural language, as a result of Kripke’s (1982) book on 
Wittgenstein’s (1953) notion of following a linguistic rule. The problem is, in short, 
that if we take the meaning of a word in terms of rules governing its correct use, we 
are faced with a puzzle that might be raised by a semantic skeptic. Namely, all we 
can be certain of are past uses of the word. So, how can we know exactly what is the 
correct future use, or what fact grounds today the correct use of the world in the 
future? There is no such fact, the skeptic says, and each use can be rendered in step 
with the rule. For example, up to this point, I referred to my daughter’s pet as “dog” 
for this was a generally accepted rule. But what is the content of this rule exactly? 
If one day I start to use the word “udog,” I may always justify it by saying something 
like this: it’s January 1, 2022; perhaps the rule deciding on the correct use of “dog” 
has always said something like “use ‘dog’ to refer to such-and-such animals up to 
December 31, 2021 and use ‘udog’ from that moment on.” Someone might, quite 
rightly, argue that this argument is just an out-of-the-blue fantasy with no real

164
bearing on anything, yet it points to something important: in most cases, rules are 
undetermined, and therefore following them can hardly be accounted for as mere 
obeying what they say. For we actually can’t say what they say exactly and the only 
way to determine that, as both Wittgenstein and then Kripke seem to hold, must be 
part of specific social practices.
Going back to our case: if institutions are rules and implementation of institu-
tions boils down to rule-following, there is a risk of rendering various hardly accept-
able behaviors to allegedly comply with the rule (like it was the case with “udog”). 
Actually, this is what likely happens when, for example, a country imports certain 
“institutions” under the pressure from international organizations such as World 
Bank, IMF or OECD, and then makes it effectively a paper fiction by filling the 
undetermined part of the rule’s content with contents that in fact detour an applica-
tion of the rule that was proven successful elsewhere. For example, you can have the 
institution of free democratic elections and various propaganda outlets make the 
choice just a formality.
Therefore, if the rule-following approach is to stand, the crucial thing we should 
focus on is not the rule itself, but how this rule is enacted and determined in actual 
local contexts. This, however, means that, first, institutions must be assumed as 
already existing at this local level – for they are the factors that determine the rules – 
and therefore they cannot be fully cashed out in terms of rules; and secondly – this 
requires a different approach to cognition, a more ecological one, i.e., taking into 
account various environmental factors determining a subject’s epistemic situation, 
thus what the subject knows and what she does not and cannot know (her ignorance).
Especially if we are to understand how the implementation or enaction of abstract 
rules fails, we may need to say something about how they lose to rules that are less 
undetermined, thus more embodied in local contexts, embodied in action, not neces-
sarily written on paper. Put differently, the rule-following approach seems to work 
well insofar as we focus on successful implementations of a rule, but if we dig 
deeper into why some of these implementations are not, or not sufficiently, success-
ful, we come across an idea according to which there must be some other rules or, 
more generally, other local factors making that the case. But why so? To answer this 
puzzle, I presume, we need to be able to say more about these local factors, their 
origin, their embodiment and embeddedness in specific environments, etc. However, 
all that the rule-following approach has to say about the latter is the distinction 
between formal rules, thus those written and enacted as law, and informal rules 
prevailing in a given culture. Yet, the latter are assumed as given.
In sum, a major problem with the rule-following approach is that it gives no sat-
isfactory tools to conceptualize the locality of institutions created and used by 
embodied cognitive agents. In other words, to grasp the phenomenon of locality, it 
can always move to a different vocabulary – the one referring to cultures, rules and 
customs, and the like – but then the key concept of institution as if fades and disap-
pears from the picture, while the existence of these local factors is left unexplained, 
just assumed.
This leads to the second argument against the rule-following conception, namely, 
that it gives no clue of how rules can be endogenously generated from cognition and

action. Therefore, there is a sharp line between behavior and rules supposedly gov-
erning behavior, as if the latter were fully external scaffolds imposed on the former. 
Meanwhile, arguably, if we are to understand the nature of institutions, we must be 
able to conceptualize and then explain the local contexts where certain patterns of 
doing things emerge.
Let us consider a scenario then, according to which institutions should be seen as 
something brought forth by specific patterns of behavior and especially coordina-
tion of behavior within a group. At this point, there comes another account of insti-
tutions – the one gaining more and more traction and invented precisely to answer 
the weaknesses of the rule-following approach. The new stream of ideas is labeled 
as equilibrium approach.
According to the equilibrium approach, institutions are “solutions to repeated 
coordination and cooperation problems as analyzed within game theory. Such solu-
tions are equilibria, which means that they generate regularities of behavior in the 
course of repeated games” (Hindriks & Guala, 2019: 3, preprint). So, here we don’t 
have this strife between what rules say, on the one hand, and what atomized indi-
viduals do, but first and foremost, a bottom-up concentration on the actual ties 
between individuals’ actions. Namely, the ties are represented as a game of some 
sort, i.e., as a coordination game (see Aoki, 2001, 2007; Binmore, 2010; Hedoin, 
2017). So, real-life decisions made by agents are modelled as moves in the game, 
and the key idea is that institutions, considered as certain patterns of behavior, 
emerge as states of equilibrium in that game. This means, roughly, a situation in 
which, for example, we have several players and each of them does something they 
consider best for them, expecting that others do what they do for the same sake. 
Hence, it is a state based on calculations of what is best for me and expectations of 
what other agents do led by the same principle. These correlated expectations create 
a certain pattern mathematically represented as a state of Nash equilibrium. Car 
traffic is a good example among numerous applications of this idea: My strategy of 
sticking to one side of the road is based on the calculation of what is best for me if 
I want to reach my destination as fast as possible, and it’s also based on my expecta-
tion that all other drivers do the same given their desired destinations. This specific 
order emerged and is kept in place not because someone decided top-down that the 
rules must be thus and so, but as a product of coordination among countless indi-
vidual strategies of behaviors. The relevant formal rule comes next, but it does not 
constitute the pattern, only spells it out, as it were (the rule may specify, e.g., to 
which side of the road the drivers should stick, right of left).
8.3  The Puzzle of Accessibility
The equilibrium approach has one major advantage over the rule-following view, at 
least from the perspective of this chapter, namely, it explains how institutions endog-
enously emerge from the pursuit of solving specific local problems, thus from cog-
nition and agency, and makes it clear why institutions cannot be imported from one 
8  Institutions as Cognitive Niches: A Dynamic of Knowledge and Ignorance

166
place to another, ignoring local patterns of behavior. That said, I will briefly outline 
an argument why this promising view is still not sufficient.
The point is this: The goals that all players want to achieve, thus certain resources 
or goods they want to get access to, are here assumed as given; they are in principle 
accessible to the players. Think of car traffic again: one person wants to get to a 
library, another drives to a grocery and yet someone else has a date. They all stick 
to the right (or the left) side of the road, which is nicely explained by the equilibrium 
approach, because they want to reach their goals most effectively. However, let me 
reiterate: the goods they all get access to thanks to the institution of the right-side 
driving are already there, and the road itself, thus infrastructure, is also there, in 
principle accessible to them.
Now, think of the same situation somewhat differently, thus not from the inside, 
but from the outside. The latter means something like this: imagine a world in which 
people are moving chaotically in every possible direction creating a huge maze with 
no patterns, and no infrastructure. And in the middle of this world there is a rela-
tively small area where people adopt a certain pattern, for example, stick to the right 
side of the road and give priority to pedestrians. This area is in the state of being far 
from equilibrium with the maze outside, just like a living creature is far from equi-
librium with its surroundings, thereby maintaining its integrity. Actually, borrowing 
the term “far from equilibrium” from thermodynamics, and especially from the 
investigations into thermodynamic foundations of life, is quite telling (see, e.g., 
Prigogine, 1997). For the living creature’s very being what it is consists in principle 
of its struggling against entropy, thus against disintegration. Thanks to the cell 
membrane and various other functional inventions of evolution at higher levels of 
complexity, the organism is in, and maintains, a state of being far from equilibrium 
with its environment: there is more complexity and organization on the inside than 
on the outside; there is more information in the inside than on the outside; usually 
there is more energy accumulated on the inside than on the outside, etc. (see, e.g., 
Kirchhoff, 2016).
Now, think of institutions, especially those considered remotely viable in this 
light: their emergence is by no means an easy process; their maintenance requires a 
lot of effort, and they are pretty rare in the world which is mostly populated by 
people living in societies where they must struggle to put food on the table, craving 
basic goods. Note that prosperous nations are not a norm, they are rather, as 
Acemoglu and Anderson (2019) argue, an exception from the average, and that fact 
merits a separate subdiscipline of economics devoted to the conditions in which 
nations or societies in general develop and prosper. So, one might aim to make the 
case that it is not equilibrium but something quite opposite that best describes the 
emergence of institutions: they are islands of order in the ocean of disorder, main-
taining their integrity by keeping themselves in the state of being far from equilib-
rium with their surroundings by a certain system of boundaries, borders or barriers.
Clearly, the concept of equilibrium is understood quite differently in game theory 
and in the thermodynamic foundations of life. Therefore, we should be careful when 
putting them together as ingredients of one argument, for there is a serious risk of 
equivocation. However, there is still a take: when approached from the inside, an 
K. Werner

167
institution may look like a system of coordinated behaviors and expectations that 
comes about as a game-like equilibrium of expectations referring to expectations. 
Meanwhile, when approached from the outside, the same institution may turn out to 
be a product of a group’s careful maintenance of non-equilibrium with the behaviors 
and expectations of those who do not belong to that group.
There is no reason to prioritize in principle any of these perspectives, either the 
internal or the external; however, the external makes one thing clear and for that 
reason shall be stressed, namely, we can see that the goods that those who maintain 
a certain pattern of action want to get access to are accessible precisely thanks to 
these patterns, thus thanks to the fact that the area is functionally separated from the 
maze outside. The goods are not assumed as given any more; instead – their being 
given results from a certain organization of behavior and a fixed organization of the 
space where people interact. Moreover, they are always given in some way, and 
therefore also with a certain precision or resolution, which means that institutions 
somehow maintain both knowledge and ignorance of agents. In Sect. 8.7, I elabo-
rate on this issue.
So, we have a loopy relationship in which the patterns of behavior emerge as a 
means to access specific goods, but, the other way around, the goods are made 
accessible in the first place due to the fact that people adopt a certain manner of 
behavior. In a pattern-lacking maze, it is not only more difficult to get access to 
some resources; they may be either in principle inaccessible, or they even may not 
be regarded as goods. For what serves as a good must be first recognized as a good 
and the latter is also a function of institutions.
Therefore, I argue that certain patterns and structures not only enable people to 
achieve their goals; they enable people to have a goal; to know their goals (to a 
certain degree, thus ignorance, as we shall see, is also built into institutions; more 
on the epistemology of ignorance see, e.g., Gross, 2010; Gross & McGoey, 2015; 
Arfini, 2019, 2021; Carrara et al., 2019). This is the intuition I shall be following in 
this analysis.
Here is another illustration to make the latter point more appealing: think of a 
soccer game. If we don’t imagine here a ready-made soccer stadium, with clear pre-­
established divisions between the pitch and the stands, but we instead think of a 
group of kids playing in the park, we may better get the sense of how a game – if we 
want to stick with this vocabulary – constitutes certain things as goods and certain 
specific locations where these goods can be found. In both cases, an “institution” of 
a soccer game is given rise to by a variety of behaviors. Yet, there is the internal 
perspective of all players who coordinate their behaviors and expectations in the 
way the game-theorists propose, in which the pitch where they play is considered by 
them as given, and so are the two goals between the trees – also taken for granted as 
parts of the game by the players. However, from the perspective of other people in 
the park, the trees’ functioning as goals is not given, but something established by 
the game as it is being played, and so is the functioning of a certain loosely delin-
eated part of the grass as a football pitch. Since other visitors to the park want to 
avoid accidents, they will take the section of the park where the kids are running 
back and forth and kicking the ball, including the trees serving as goals, as 
8  Institutions as Cognitive Niches: A Dynamic of Knowledge and Ignorance

168
temporarily cut-off from the park, thus as a certain specific area that provides the 
kids with specific goods (scores, e.g., if the ball gets between the mentioned trees). 
Hence, certain patterns of behavior here not only enable the kids to score a goal, 
which is the main objective from the inside of the game; these patterns establish a 
particular event in the physical world – the ball’s particular location between par-
ticular trees in this case – as a good, and they also establish a certain space where 
this good is accessible.
So, let me reiterate: I propose here, and aim to develop this view a bit in the sub-
sequent sections, that institutions shall be considered primarily not so much as equi-
libria or systems of rules enabling people to get access to given resources, but as 
specific local systems of relations – governed by certain rules, emerged as states of 
equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium, or described functionally in yet another 
way – that cast certain things in the world in the role of goods, thereby making them, 
in a certain way and to a certain degree, accessible to people participating in the 
system (outside of which the said goods are not accessible and are not even recog-
nized qua goods). In short, institutions, whether they do it by means of rules or 
coordination games or in some other way, are local enablers of access. Therefore, 
both knowledge and ignorance are built into the functioning of each institution, 
which shall be portrayed in greater detail in Sects. 8.7, 8.8 and 8.9.
The rest of the chapter is devoted to a stepwise unpacking of this idea: taking the 
mentioned locality and the mentioned function of enabling access as the core ideas 
that need to be spelled out more technically.
8.4  The Niche
I propose to consider institutions as something that emerged at some point based on 
less “advanced,” for the lack of a better word, strategies of dealing with the world 
undertaken by other animals; in particular – as specific niches, specifically so-called 
cognitive niches. The niche terminology shall enable us to unpack the intuitions 
rolled out in the previous sections (more on the concept of the niche, see Laland 
et al., 2000; Odling-Smee et al., 2003; Laland & Sterelny, 2006). This point, there-
fore, marks a certain change in terminology which, otherwise, might seem to the 
reader rapid, unexpected and even obscure. There is a clear reason for that change, 
though; let me reiterate: I am about to provide a naturalistic account, or rather a 
smattering of such an account, of institutions thought of as local products of behav-
ior and cognition, and also, more broadly, as products of evolution. I shall go back 
to a more familiar terminology usually attributable to institutional theories in Sect. 
8.6 for a brief moment, and then in Sects. 8.9 and 8.10.
To begin with, classically, a niche can be first considered as a specific place (see 
Elton, 1927) where an animal can thrive, i.e., where it finds shelter, thus relative 
safety, where it can collect resources, etc. Nests, caves or burrows are intuitive 
examples of individual niches composing together bigger habitats attributable to a 
given species. However, a more abstract characterization championed by Hutchinson 
K. Werner

169
(1957) points to specific environmental conditions rather than places. For example, 
suppose that a given species needs a temperature between 10 °C and 20 °C and a 
high average humidity. We can define a system of coordinates with the line of tem-
perature, the line of humidity (a measure thereof), then within this system we can 
determine an abstract space determined by the relevant needs of the target animal, 
and this will be an abstract representation of that animal’s niche. If we now think of 
all n environmental factors that are relative to that animal’s needs, and we determine 
the conditions that each of n factors needs to satisfy, we thereby define the n-­
dimensional space that represents the animal’s niche.
Note that the notion of a condition is very abstract, which means that Hutchinson’s 
approach gives us a chance to consider many different factors, not only those usu-
ally considered by biologists, as ones that define a niche, for example, factors hav-
ing to do with cognition and complex social behavior. We shall take this route 
later on.
It should be stressed, however, that both of these classic conceptions are rather 
static, meaning that the niche is just determined by what a given living creature is. 
Meanwhile, we have many examples of how organisms, especially (but not exclu-
sively) animals, transform their environments. Think of birds building nests or bea-
vers altering at large scale water flows in their surroundings. That said, the so-called 
niche construction theory has become a wide new paradigm of looking at various 
functions performed by animals, including humans (see, e.g., Laland & 
O’Brien, 2011).
Here, the thing is that niches have a certain function, they are built for a purpose. 
Animals want to secure, to the extent possible, their access to specific goods – this 
may be food, but also relative safety, or some information resource. The fact that 
niche construction theory has targeted even such complex and specifically human 
phenomenon as culture, and it openly speaks of cultural niches (Laland et al., 2000; 
Laland & O’Brien, 2011), while some other scholars also approached the virtual 
realms we’re more and more entangled with in terms of niches – virtual cognitive 
niches to be precise (see Arfini et al., 2017) – creates, in my view, an ample space to 
take a further step and try to see institutions through the niche lens.
Let us proceed stepwise, though. So, in the first step, I assume that the most fun-
damental function of a niche is making it possible for a given animal (a species) to 
access a specific portion of the world – a specific resource or good. Let me empha-
size this modal point: niches are realms of possibilities; they in principle do not 
provide their tenants with actual goods, for the latter must be achieved by the tenant, 
but they create a space of agency where achievement is a thinkable option.1
Modifying the original Hutchinson’s n-dimensional space, I propose to represent 
the niche as an n-argument function whose domain consists of kinds of resources or 
goods a given organism needs, chunked into measurable units (e.g., if it is water, it 
1 There are several additional conceptual and ontological puzzles having to do with niches, targeted 
by the formal discipline called mereotopology (see Smith & Varzi, 1999), but I skip these in this 
paper, assuming here that speaking of realms, spaces or locations is intuitively understandable (see 
Werner, 2020).
8  Institutions as Cognitive Niches: A Dynamic of Knowledge and Ignorance

170
is chunked, for example, into daily portions needed to thrive), and the codomain 
contains a fixed measure of energy required to get these resources/goods or a certain 
measure of effort. In other words, as if anticipating the talk of institutions, we can 
conceptualize the energy loss or the effort as a cost. So, there are certain costs the 
organism o must pay to get a unit of the resource/good. Suppose, for simplicity, that 
we take into consideration here only one kind of resource/good cut into measur-
able chunks.
Here is the key idea I put forward: We can represent a niche as a function of 
consumption of the given resource/good in which the cost of getting the good goes 
more or less rapidly down to a certain level. Now, various further options are pos-
sible. The cost can stay at this level for all subsequent consumptions or – if, for 
example, we have a certain process of learning and mastery on the side of the animal 
involved – the cost can systematically decrease with subsequent consumptions to a 
certain threshold (Fig. 8.1). In the ideal niche, the cost would approach zero.
Note the intention behind this simplified account: If there is no niche, the costs 
of getting the resource approach infinity, which stands for the fact that the resource 
is effectively inaccessible. Now, the effectiveness of a given niche is represented by 
how rapidly the cost goes down, how much it goes down, and whether this effect is 
a one-time slump or a continuous pattern.
Of course, in reality, the costs never approach zero (see 5 below), but this is, by 
definition, a kind of ideal situation for each niche constructor, when from a certain 
point getting the fixed resource becomes effortless.
Fig. 8.1  The “niche construction” function 
K. Werner

171
However, some specific cases can approach the ideal quite effectively. Imagine, 
say, a mouse trying to find a shelter in which it would be safe from snakes. It requires 
a lot of effort to find such new places every single day, but once the mouse finds a 
burrow, while its life as a whole can still hardly be deemed effortless, at least this 
one thing, namely, finding a shelter, becomes almost effortless – from a certain point 
on (and for some period of time, too) it’s almost effortless in the sense that it’s 
always there. This picture is, clearly, oversimplified, but it is supposed to illustrate 
the main idea.
Now, of course, if we have not just one, but n various resources, lowering the 
costs of all of them must be balanced somehow for it is virtually impossible for all 
of the costs to go down the same path. In such a case, the process of niche construc-
tion is best described in terms of optimization of the function in question. I shall not 
dig into details, though.
8.5  The Cognitive Niche
Given all that, especially given how abstract Hutchinson’s (1957) characteristics as 
well as the functional description just given are, we can think of various kinds of 
niches and various levels at which a niche can function. So, we can theoretically 
distinguish, for example, a metabolic niche, which means a space of possibilities 
entirely defined by the metabolic processes and thus metabolic needs of a given 
organisms. Think of a bacterium in a specific solution and the inner-outer traffic that 
is going on all the time through the cell membrane: The selected chemical com-
plexes surrounding the bacterium can be considered its purely metabolic niche.
On the other hand, van Duijn et al. (2006) famously argue that already at the level 
of unicellular organisms, for example, Escherichia coli (E-coli), we may think of a 
certain meta-metabolic functioning, thus such a functioning of the organism that 
contributes to its metabolism, clearly, but is not part of metabolism. They propose 
to think of E-coli’s chemotaxis, i.e., its movements to an attractant and away from a 
repellent in this way. The movement, based on sensorimotor coordination, is obvi-
ously beneficial to metabolism but, they argue, it does not belong to metabolism. In 
this sense, it is meta-metabolic and, according to van Duijn et al. (2006), this step 
into the meta-metabolic level of interactions with the organism’s surrounding 
marked the step toward the domain of cognition. If that’s the case, sensorimotor 
coordination and the ability to move bring forth entirely new conditions in the 
Hutchinsonian sense that the organism’s surrounding is expected to satisfy. These 
conditions may also determine a niche and this niche will likely be more complex 
than the purely metabolic niche. Noteworthily, Di Paolo et al. (2017) use the term 
“sensorimotor habitat” in a similar context.
Now, even if sensorimotor coordination does not determine an entirely new kind 
of niche, this new meta-metabolic dimension of the organism–world relationship is 
certainly one that a new kind of niche can be built upon. For the sensorimotor capac-
ity significantly broadens the range of accessible things. In effect, the range of 
8  Institutions as Cognitive Niches: A Dynamic of Knowledge and Ignorance

172
goods, we might say, is not any more limited to the stuff directly surrounding the 
living creature, thus proximal resources, so to speak, and instead the organism can 
do something to get access to some of the distant potential resources. It arguably 
marks a revolutionary change, which lays the groundwork for a new kind of 
surroundings.
That said, anthropologists John Tooby and Irven De Vore (1987) first proposed 
the term “cognitive niche.” Focused exclusively on human cognition, they come to 
the conclusion that what makes us special is the advanced capacity to trace and 
exploit cause–effect bonds in our surroundings. In other words, we are good at 
building and using models of causal relations. Following this path, we are also good 
at transforming these causal connections to further improve our cognitive function-
ing. The latter is emphasized by Steven Pinker (2003, 2010), who approaches cogni-
tive niches from the evolutionary perspective, and by Andy Clark (2005, 2006) 
when he writes (for more discussion of the cognitive niche see Bertolotti & 
Magnani, 2017):
“cognitive niche construction” [is] hereby defined as the process by which animals build 
physical structures that transform problem spaces in ways that aid (or sometimes impede) 
thinking and reasoning about some target domain or domains. These physical structures 
combine with appropriate culturally transmitted practices to enhance problem-solving, and 
(in the most dramatic cases) to make possible whole new forms of thought and reason. 
(Clark, 2005: 256–257)
I believe that Tooby and De Vore as well as Pinker and Clark are doing a good 
job by pointing to specific functions of cognitive niches, yet, to me, their approaches 
do not take full advantage of the concept (see Werner, 2020). For they all assume the 
surrounding realm of things and goods as given, as being already there, so to speak, 
at the moment when an organism begins the construction of its cognitive niche, and 
the task that the niche is to fulfill is to actually get and exploit these goods in a more 
efficient manner. Metaphorically, it’s like doing various things in a lightened room: 
you can picture the room (which is like creating a model) or transform the preexist-
ing configuration of things so that they better serve your needs, etc. But the room 
and the things inside are already enlightened, thus present, accessible, waiting to be 
pictured, grabbed, used, manipulated.
This assumption is somewhat analogous to the one made by the cited concep-
tions of institutions – there, too, the very availability of various goods was assumed 
upfront. This analogy is exactly what I aim here at. For in both cases we may pose 
a fundamental question of what makes these good/resources available or accessi-
ble. The analogy just drawn prompts to seek one answer that would work for both 
areas of inquiry, which – insofar as the actual state of the art in both disciplines is 
considered, i.e., in the philosophy of cognitive science, on the one hand, and insti-
tutional economics supported by socio-ontology, on the other – maintain no connec-
tion whatsoever. The time is ripe, I believe, to draw a connection.
So, the story I’m trying to tell here goes at least one step deeper. For I believe that 
the concept of cognitive niche has the capacity to cash out how certain parts or seg-
ments of the world become accessible and thus begin to function as resources, 
goods, goals or means. Just think of a very intuitive example: thanks to the capacity 
K. Werner

173
of processing electromagnetic waves reflected by things in such a manner as to 
make them into a vehicle of information, thus thanks to vision, organisms are able 
to get partial access to very distant entities without the need to (and without the risk 
of) actually moving in their proximity. So, my point is that the cognitive niche is not 
primarily about what organisms do in a pregiven and already accessible realm, pre-
sumably just waiting to be modelled – instead, the most fundamental goal of a 
cognitive niche is bringing the world to a presentation, as if casting light into a dark 
room, thereby making it visibly accessible. Yet, if each such presentation, for exam-
ple, built up on the basis of electromagnetic waves, depends on the cognitive 
machinery processing them in species-specific ways, we cannot say that the presen-
tation at stake awaits the organism capable of cognition to come up and just model 
it. Neither does it mean that the organism creates some subjective projection “in its 
head.” This cognitive organism–world bond is much more subtle, which is best 
characterized by Francisco Varela and collaborators (1991) in this quite famous 
fragment:
The key point, then, is that species brings forth and specifies its own domain of problems to 
be solved (…); this domain does not exist “out there” in an environment that acts as a land-
ing pad for organisms that somehow drop or parachute into the world. Instead, living beings 
and their environments stand in relation to each other through mutual specification or code-
termination. Thus what we describe as environmental regularities are not external features 
that have been internalized (…). Environmental regularities are the result of a conjoint 
history, a congruence that unfolds from a long history of codetermination. (Varela et al., 
1991: 198–199)
The metaphorical characterization of the cognitive niche as a construct that 
brings the world to a presentation can be unpacked more technically in various 
ways – in the next section, I shall unpack it in terms of specific costs, which will 
prove beneficial when I tackle the problem of institutions further on. Yet, this cost-
related characterization can hardly do justice to the mentioned subtlety and also 
fundamentality of the cognitive organism–world bond. Therefore, we must spill 
some ink first to roll out a different vocabulary. Here I’ll provide just a tiny fraction 
of it, made of various proposals I’ve tried out in my other publications (see Werner, 
2020, 2021; Werner & Kiełkowicz-Werner, 2021).
This sketch is based on the notion of structural coupling, which proves espe-
cially pivotal in the embodied cognition literature (see, e.g., Varela et al., 1991; 
Thompson, 2007; Di Paolo et al., 2017; Di Paolo et al., 2018). I assume the follow-
ing definition (this is an amended version of the one given in Werner & Kiełkowicz-­
Werner, 2021 with relevant literature references):
Structural coupling. An organism is structurally coupled with its surroundings if
	(a)	 The organism executes various selection or transformation mechanisms targeting some seg-
ments of its surrounding, and as a result of this selection/transformation, these segments can 
be further exploited by the organism in the process of maintaining its integrity and agency.
	(b)	 The selected and/or transformed entities determine future states of the organism as well as its 
future selection/transformation mechanisms. Thus, structural coupling is not a linear process, 
but rather a looped codetermination of the subject and its surroundings.
8  Institutions as Cognitive Niches: A Dynamic of Knowledge and Ignorance

174
Therefore, structural coupling is a process responsible for this specific phenom-
enon of mutual determination of the living creature and its environment, which 
Varela and collaborators (1991) cited above emphasized.
However, first, structural coupling is not by its nature cognitive – life as such is 
in part determined by the process in question. Therefore, the distinction between 
metabolic and meta-metabolic processes sketched earlier, following van Duijn et al. 
(2006), proves crucial here – we must limit our attention to the latter.
Second, as a process, this meta-metabolic structural coupling does not have to 
result in anything relatively stable. This is a pivotal moment – we can think of struc-
tural coupling as a kind of flow of mutual determinations that do not produce any-
thing robust.
Here Twardowski’s (1912/1999) classic distinction between acts and products 
comes on stage. Think, for example, of an act or a process composed of acts of 
painting – there are certain properties attributable to, as well as certain circum-
stances having to do with the act/process, but not the product of it – a ready-made 
painting. And vice versa. Traditionally, what we see when we go to a gallery is 
products of painting, not acts of painting (performance artists were revolutionary in 
the sense that they upended this very distinction). Analogously, what we interpret is 
a poem, not the process of writing a poem (even if some information about the latter 
can prove to be helpful).
Based on Twardowski’s posit, we can draw a rough-and-ready distinction 
between productive, for example, painting, and non-productive processes such as 
running or boxing. As for the latter, we can speak in specific contexts that, say, the 
fights between Fury and Wilder are one of the most famous boxing contests in his-
tory, we can even watch recordings, nonetheless, there is no actual product of these 
processes or series of acts – “the fights” refers to three unique and unproductive 
performances.
Now, the meta-metabolic structural coupling could also be non-productive, and 
likely it is non-productive in the case of E-coli’s chemotaxis, provided that it is 
meta-metabolic at all, as van Duijn et al. (2006) argue. This means that chemotaxis 
does not result in any new stabilized, relatively robust structures either within 
E-coli’s surroundings or within its own meta-metabolic patterns. However, on the 
other extreme – if we think of a scale of cognitive sophistication – the fact is that we 
do live in a cognized world composed of relatively stable and robust entities such as 
everyday things, trees, chairs and tables, more or less clearly delineated, bounded; 
of processes beginning at one moment and ending at a different moment, etc. The 
outcome of this first-person recognition can most likely be applied to many other, if 
not all, animals, for they also live inside certain species-specific stabilized realms 
(each in its species-specific Umwelt as von Uexküll, 1926 famously put it). And this 
phenomenon of relative stability of what Sellars (1956) called the manifest image of 
the world, provided that this image is based on the evolutionary history of structural 
coupling, calls for an explanation (see Werner, forthcoming). The concept of the 
cognitive niche comes out as part of such an explanation.
All that being said, I propose:
K. Werner

175
Cognitive niche: for a fixed organism o, the cognitive niche of o is a realm, different from o 
itself, that is a relatively stable emergent product of meta-metabolic processes of structural 
coupling maintained by o and selected segments of its surrounding.
We must assume here that the notion of emergence is taken for granted for the 
lack of space to unpack it. Speaking of emergent products, in step with a more or 
less standard understanding of emergence, is supposed to emphasize that these 
products are qualitatively new entities, not reducible to the material they are made 
of (perhaps all products are emergent products; I set this issue aside here).
8.6  Cost-Effectiveness of the Cognitive Niche
Once certain segments of the organism’s surroundings become a realm of cognition-­
related stability (for, needless to say, we are not talking here about the stability of 
the universe that physicists have in mind), which means at the most “primitive” 
level that certain patterns of action can emerge, it becomes plausible to reintroduce 
the notion of costs – to rearticulate it at a meta-metabolic level, building on the cost-­
related characterization of niche given above.
This will be a specific kind of cost, though, since, crucially, the cognitive niche 
gives rise to a new kind of access – a cognitive access, which means, in a more tra-
ditional vocabulary, access to information or knowledge. So, the resource itself 
changes here, for at the end of the day the resource that cognitive niches make 
access to possible are also of a meta-metabolic-related character, so to speak, mean-
ing that it is information or knowledge. Here is why. First, note that in the complete 
absence of a meta-metabolic-related structure in its surroundings, thus without any 
cognitive link between an organism and a distant entity, the organism would have to 
move in direct proximity of the entity, just like E-coli must do, and “taste” the thing, 
and then wait for what happens next, etc. When a cognitive niche is established, it 
might be enough for the organism to see that there is such and such thing to “con-
clude” that this is, say, a potential food. Getting access in this context means seeing, 
thus clearly something of a different nature from “tasting” (this applies not only to 
vision, of course). But this all means that what the organism got thanks to its cogni-
tive niche, a specific resource, is not the food, but a piece of information or partial 
knowledge about the thing qua food, and the situation surrounding it.
Therefore, with the new kind of resource given rise to within the cognitive niche, 
we can also speak of a new kind of cost named cognitive access cost. Now, I pro-
pose to retain the basic intuition articulated in the simple functional illustration 
provided above in Fig. 8.1, while, first, taking the resource variable to stand for 
portions of information/knowledge; and second – taking the cost variable to refer to 
cognitive access costs. This means that the goal of the cognitive niche, approached 
functionally, is to decrease cognitive access costs.
A reader who is familiar with the social sciences, with economy in the first place, 
may already have some pre-established idea of how to think of cognitive access

costs, or, to put it in a better way, how these costs manifest themselves at a very 
highly complex level of human social interactions. For, admittedly, the idea just put 
forward harks back to the notion of transaction costs pioneered by Hicks (1935) and 
Coase (1937, 1960), among others, and them famously articulated by Williamson 
(1979; for an overview see Williamson & Masten, 1999; Hardt, 2008). It is a very 
convenient correlation given the fact that theorizing about transaction costs was one 
of the factors that gave rise to the new institutional economics and the very target of 
this chapter is to say something potentially new and plausible about institutions.
Cognitive access costs are attributable to all organisms capable of cognition, 
which is obviously not the case when it comes to transaction costs, yet the latter are, 
I argue, grounded in the former. This gives us some preliminary idea about a pos-
sible naturalization of the notion of transaction costs.
So, let us take a brief look at the notion just invoked, as if anticipating the final 
result of the chapter which is supposed to be about institutions. Williamson (1979) 
and others before him, for example, Marshall (1920), noted that transactions them-
selves are taken by neoclassical economics as costless, thus effortless, meanwhile, 
in reality, they are not. In order for a transaction to happen, both sides of it must put 
some effort to investigate the other side, whether or not it can be trusted, to learn 
about possible options or scenarios of the transaction, about all the rules and laws 
imposed on the possible transaction, etc. The very uncertainty about the outcome of 
the transaction, thus the risk attributed to it, is also a cost. If there is asymmetry of 
information between the sides, one side may be willing to square it down, which is 
also costly. Given all such constraints, we can think of transaction costs as specific 
frictions (actually, this was already noted in the nineteenth century; many econo-
mists used to talk of friction back then). By analogy, engineers learn about ideal 
engines, which are necessary theoretical fictions, but in reality, there is always fric-
tion they must take into account in their calculations.
Institutions, thought of from this angle, are there to lower the friction, thus to 
lower transaction costs; for example, to lower the risk, or make a more balanced 
information distribution possible, or to provide a readable structure of regulations 
(see, e.g., Williamson, 2000), etc. The point is that this role can now be seen in a 
much broader perspective set up by the notion of cognitive niche and its simplified 
account in terms of structural coupling, products of structural coupling, and there-
fore cognitive access costs. I shall draw on this general idea later on.
Finally, note again that inaccessibility is represented in the form of infinite cog-
nitive access costs. When it comes to the cognitive niche, inaccessibility means total 
ignorance: not only the living creature does not know anything specific about a 
given resource/good and does not know how to get it; it does not even know that 
there is a resource/good to get. Of course, the concept of infinite cognitive costs is a 
theoretical fiction, too, but it gives the sense, and represents the notion, of total inac-
cessibility or ignorance. From this perspective, the construction of a cognitive niche 
means decreasing the level of ignorance.
This is not the whole story, though. Actually, it is the concept of ignorance that 
enables us to dig even deeper into the nature of cognitive niches, and therefore – in 
the final part  – of institutions thought of in this naturalistic, environmentally

plugged-in and bottom-up fashion. Therefore, the time is ripe for a more substantial 
treatment of the issue of ignorance.
8.7  A Niched Ignorance: Beyond Cognitive Limitations
The talk of decreasing the level of ignorance suggests that ignorance itself is some-
thing negative (something we must decrease) or, at best, neutral (something we 
must live with and accept), but never positive. From this perspective, I would like to 
make a breakthrough in this section and adopt a “non-pejorative” attitude to igno-
rance, as Gaudet (2015) calls it. She argues, convincingly, that ignorance as a neces-
sary element of our epistemic situation, dynamizes the pursuit of knowledge 
construction. This dynamizing aspect of ignorance has been recognized, for exam-
ple, by Gross (2010) in reference to the pursuit of scientific investigation. I shall 
take a step further and make room for the openly affirmative approach to ignorance 
and its role in cognitive niches, more in line with Williams (2021), to be rolled out 
in Sect. 8.9, after some conceptual preparations made here. As we shall see, some 
kind of ignorance is constitutive to cognitive niches as such, and thus to institutions, 
to the effect that ignorance is not so much beneficial as ignorance, but – perhaps 
surprisingly – it is beneficial as a producer of knowledge. Yet, to make this approach 
possible or even thinkable, we need, in a sense, to free the concept of ignorance 
from the odium it is usually attributed to. As mentioned, in this latter endeavor, I 
follow, for example, Williams (2021), who finds a place for well-motivated, rational 
ignorance as an integral ingredient of our epistemic pursuits (see also Arfini & 
Magnani, 2021; Zimmermann, 2008).
First, however, also to make the announced approach possible, ignorance must 
be recognized as an extended, situated or environmentally plugged-in phenomenon; 
one that lends itself to being captured in niche terms. Arfini (2021) comes up with 
the first proposal of this sort in the ignorance literature, arguing convincingly that 
while reference to ignorance in the embodied/situated cognition literature is scarce, 
the notion itself is assumed there as a tacit given. Meanwhile, she says, “in order to 
understand how ignorance can be extended and distributed in spaces, artifacts, and 
other people we should first establish a way to practically analyze the relationship 
between the agent and her eco-cognitive environment” (Arfini, 2021: 4085).
I agree with the latter, yet in my reading, embodied ignorance according to Arfini 
is still a rather negative or at best neutral condition. For example, we read that 
“humans lean heavily on forms of epistemological support and scaffolding that per-
mit them to tune and integrate internal and external epistemic resources. In these 
perspectives we can assume that ignorance, seen as the limitation of those resources 
(…), affects the distribution of knowledge, information, and data into the  
environment” (ibid.). Moreover, setting the stage for her proposal, Arfini writes  
that “misinformations, biases, erroneous beliefs, false statements, and many more 
ignorance instantiations should be taken into consideration by the cognitive  
philosophical literature (…)” (Arfini, 2021: 4082).

178
My point is not that the listed phenomena are not troublesome or that they should 
not be targeted by philosophers working in the embodied/situated paradigm; 
clearly – they are real and therefore need to be accounted for (see, e.g., Dellantonio 
& Pastore, 2020). That said, I’d like to emphasize an entirely different exemplifica-
tion of ignorance built into the structure of any cognitive niche – one that, indeed, 
stems from cognitive limitations, but does not simply boil down to them. Rather, it 
is an emergent product of these limitations.
To begin with, think of perception. It’s clear that each perceptual scene is deter-
mined by a certain selection made by the cognitive machinery, out of an enormous 
variety of causal connections between physical entities; it results from a certain 
carving up or, as Varzi (2016) nicely puts it, “drawing lines across the board,” where 
the “board” eventually refers, if we adopt a somewhat naïve-physicalist perspective 
for the sake of the argument, to swarms of particles deployed in space. If put in an 
“anthropomorphic” manner, we could say that each manifest image of the world or 
its presentation is a “choice” made by the cognitive machinery, out of a huge pool 
of possible presentations, layouts or images. Now, one aspect of that “choice” is 
cognitive limitation, since, clearly, no cognitive machinery could process all possi-
ble “carvings-up” of the particle swarms. So, here comes something that might be 
called perceptual ignorance, more or less in line with the ignorance literature, 
whose core feature is limitation. Perceptual ignorance means that a vast majority of 
possible perceptual “carvings-up” is not accessible to the perceptual system given 
the fact that, first, it can process only a limited portion of data; and, second – it does 
it in a particular, evolutionarily determined manner. This is not the whole 
story, though.
In the vocabulary rolled out in Sect. 8.6, each perceptual “carving-up” results 
from, and is actually performed by, structural coupling. As I stressed, structural 
coupling is productive – each cognitive niche is a relatively stable emergent product 
of species-specific and situation-specific structural coupling. Yet, note that this pro-
ductivity is possible exactly thanks to perceptual limitations. It can be put in the 
following way: the swarm of particles around me is so complex and untraceable, 
that only thanks to the perceptual “choices” made by my cognitive machinery, as a 
result of my structural coupling, I can get access to them in any manner. In yet other 
words, without this built-in limitation, I would be unable to get cognitive access to 
anything whatsoever. Therefore, aside from the issue of limitation, we can also say 
that each perceptual “carving-up” in a sense “masks” the complexity of the organ-
ism’s (the perceiver’s) surroundings, thereby providing a cognitively accessible, 
emergent layout of it.
So, another aspect of each cognitive niche, alongside limitation, is something 
that might be referred as an emergent product of this limitation, to be precise – an 
emergent product of the limitation of structural coupling. The point, quite peculiar 
at first glimpse, is that this emergent product of cognitive limitation, actually of 
cognitive acts limiting or “masking” the complexity of the world, is not itself a limi-
tation, just like a poem is not identical to the process of writing a poem. Therefore, 
the emergent product of the ignorance at stake is not an exemplification of 
K. Werner

179
ignorance; however tricky it must seem – it is knowledge of a sort; first of all a prac-
tical knowledge-how or a capacity to act and to create patterns of action; impossible 
inside the swarm of particles, but double within a certain relatively stable manifest 
image of the world.
To sum up this part – ignorance plays a crucial and somewhat surprising role in 
the process of cognitive niche construction, in my view, for it is ignorance that pro-
duces knowledge. It not only makes room for knowledge or incentivize cognitive 
efforts, which is what Williams (2021) would say, but it actually produces knowl-
edge insofar as it is situated in the sense proposed by Arfini (2021), thus insofar as 
it is part of structural coupling. To avoid conceptual confusion, we can speak here 
of niched ignorance. As we shall see later on, this specific quality of the cognitive 
niche uncovers an intriguing aspect of institutions – how we can benefit from igno-
rance thanks to them.
8.8  Toward the Idea of Expected Location of Goods
The cognitive niche is a necessary condition of making any resources/goods acces-
sible if they are not in direct contact with the living creature. So, the issue of dis-
tance is crucial here, beginning with spatial distance, simply put, when it comes to 
perception, but we could also think of various other kinds of distance. I’m about to 
exploit this locational aspect a bit more now, and for a specific purpose.
The cognitive niche portrayed in the functional manner in step with Fig. 8.1 can 
work better or worse in making cognitive access possible, thus in lowering the cog-
nitive access costs, but this characterization is way too coarse-grained – it says noth-
ing specific about what is actually happening when one cognitive niche works better 
than others. We must therefore use a different model to capture this dynamic. With 
this move, we are moving closer to the announced reintroduction of the institution 
talk, a vocabulary that is more familiar to institutional theorists.
I propose to draw inspiration from a classic location model proposed by Hotelling 
(1929), which was supposed to describe the dynamics of consumer preferences in a 
very simplified situation in which the only two factors that differentiate goods are, 
first, their price and, second, their distance from the consumer, i.e., in fact, transpor-
tation cost that has to be added to the price. Hotelling proposed to model this situa-
tion as a setup in which we have consumers fixed at their places along a line, for 
example, a street, and firms offering identical products at various points along this 
street. Therefore, aside from changing prices, the firms may gain some advantage 
over one another by changing their location – since consumers base their decision 
solely on how much they will have to spend overall to get a particular good. This 
model explains very nicely, for example, why it frequently happens that there is no 
gas station along a highway as you drive 50 kilometers and, suddenly, you have 
three packed in neighboring parcels. The model also serves as the basis for the so-­
called median voter theory (see Black, 1948) actually used by political parties and 
8  Institutions as Cognitive Niches: A Dynamic of Knowledge and Ignorance

180
explaining why it happens at times that major parties in the West are almost indis-
tinguishable in terms of their programs, while, at the same time, there come about 
various extreme parties placed on the edges of the political spectrum (the “street” – 
the model is of course abstract enough to encompass various kinds of distance, not 
only the physical one as in the case of gas stations).
These are all well-known things taught to economics undergraduates. Here I 
shall not use the original Hotelling model, but a certain development thereof. So, 
suppose that we have a line like the one in the original model, and we have one 
consumer/subject S located precisely in the middle of the line or “street.” The street 
is our cognitive niche. Therefore, while the functional depiction given earlier was 
like a gauge measuring the functioning of the niche from outside, this time we get 
inside, as it were.
First, suppose that on the left and on the right sides of the consumer/subject S, in 
equal distances from S, there are two goods  – G1 and G2 (which means that 
d1 = d2):
Crucially, we must realize that Fig.  8.2 takes the perspective of an external 
observer who is capable of taking a glimpse inside our street-like model of S’s loca-
tion. Clearly – it’s a God-Eye standpoint which is not available to S. Taking the 
latter into account, we must realize that the exact location of G1 and G2 is not 
known to S. Insofar as we stick with realism, we assume that there is an objective 
fact of their being placed here or there, but this fact can only be estimated in a better 
or worse way by S. By comparison, think of statistical models: suppose that we 
want to pin down what is the expected value of height of the people living in the 
UE. As realists, we assume that there exists such a number; however, given the fact 
that we are by no means in a position to measure the height of each 400+ million 
individuals, we can only propose a certain estimator which will – we hope – give 
results that are as close as possible to the value we wish to know. Here, too, our S 
can only speak of expected locations of G1 and G2.
What does decide on where an expected location, distinguished from the actual 
location is? First, infrastructure. Suppose that S has an old, badly maintained road, 
riddled with holes leading to G1, and a highway leading to G2. This will certainly 
render G2 closer in terms of its expected location despite the fact that, objectively 
(which we know as God-Eye spectators) the two goods are equidistant from S.
Infrastructure, however, cannot do the job on its own. For imagine that for some 
reason, while the people using the old road know how to drive and thus the driving 
goes smoothly, those using the highway have no idea how to do it – in effect, nobody 
even knows whether they should drive on the left or on the right, what is the safest 
or the most efficient speed, how to pass other cars safely, etc. In effect, taking the 
Fig. 8.2  “God-Eye” location model

181
old route could be, contrary to our initial intuition, the more effective option. 
Therefore, taking the latter fact into account, G1 turns out to be, from the standpoint 
of S, closer in terms of expected location than G2.
We are thereby approaching our target topic. For note that both the state of equi-
librium that the drivers on the old road maintain and those on the highway lack, as 
well as the rules which are imposed on the former, but not on the latter, are factors 
that are not considered here as institutions in themselves, but nevertheless they make 
a great come-back in this essay as crucial means to achieve a goal; to render the 
expected location of G1 or G2 closer to S. That said, we are heading toward such 
account institutions according to which they are factors that in some way manipu-
late the expected location of resources/goods.
So, we have, for example:
Yet, what Fig. 8.3 in principle depicts is not only about institutions – it is a gen-
eral description of what a cognitive niche of S does. Now, such a cognitive niche can 
be devoted to at least two different tasks having to do with the expected location of 
resources/goods. First, the cognitive niche can be dedicated, like the statistical 
model brought earlier, to estimating the actual location of the goods. Thus the goal 
of a cognitive niche so conceived of would be to render the expected location as 
close to the factual location as possible. Compare the expected location of G1 with 
the expected location of G2 in Fig. 8.3. While the estimation made by ExpG1 is 
better than the estimation made by ExpG2, ExpG1 “places” G1 a bit farther away 
from S than G1 actually is, and while the estimation made by ExpG2 is much less 
accurate, it places G2 closer to S. This is quite telling, and we need to decide which 
of these cases is preferred. If accuracy is a value S prefers at a given occasion – for 
example, it seems better to know where the predator actually is when you are a 
potential prey – S should definitely prefer the estimation on the left since ExpG1 is 
closer to G1.
However, accuracy may not be the goal. For example, placing ExpG2 closer to S 
may represent the fact that getting access to G2 is less costly than getting access to 
G1, despite the fact that they are equally distanced from S. For an expected location 
is not determined by how big the distance itself is, nor even by how S sees the dis-
tance, but rather by how much “friction,” in the sense sketched above, there is along 
the way or, from a different angle, by how much the “friction” is lowered.

8.9  Institutions: How to Benefit from Ignorance
The connection between knowledge, ignorance and costs was made explicit by 
Williams (2021) who convincingly argues that the costs of acquiring knowledge 
may at times outweigh the benefits of possessing it (Williams, 2021: 7808). Here, 
however, the issue is even more tricky, as already elicited in Sect. 8.7 – there are 
cases in which not knowing is in a peculiar sense beneficial. This happens when the 
domain of action is so well-organized that we are, so to speak, not even aware of 
how distanced something is. Think again of the mentioned highway, assuming that 
all drivers are competent in using it, and imagine someone saying something like 
“Oh, the driving went so smoothly, I don’t even feel that it was two hundred kilome-
ters.” Somebody committed to representationalism could say that thanks to the 
highway as well as various organizational and behavioral factors, the destination on 
the cited driver’s mental map was much closer to the driver’s departure point than it 
“should” be when compared with other possible destinations, equally distanced, yet 
less accessible due to bad infrastructure. “Should” means that had accuracy been 
the goal of making the said mental map, all destinations would be more or less 
equally distanced from the departure point.
Therefore, I shall explore now this practical aspect of the cognitive niche, dedi-
cated not so much to making the expected location as accurate as possible, but 
rather to rendering it as close to the cognizer as possible.
This aspect of the cognitive niche is clear, for example, in Clark’s approach. He 
says that the cognitive niche is there to ease (or impede) our cognitive functioning, 
and given the variety of the latter, this is not only about accuracy but also about 
more practical concerns. He gives an illustrative example: image a bartender who 
must remember a long list of orders made by clients, of whom each wants a different 
drink. Now, suppose that each kind of drink is conventionally tied to a specific kind 
of glass. The bartender may now reorganize their surroundings, thus construct a 
cognitive niche, in such a way as to make the work easier, for example, by making 
a row of glasses in accordance with the sequence of orders and with the kinds of 
drink ordered so that, for example, he or she doesn’t have to remember that, say, the 
fifth order was Martini – the right kind of glass stands fifth in the row, so it’s enough 
to keep in mind the rigid, thus repeatable correlation between Martini and the kind 
of glass. Now, if we imagine each ready-made drink, thus each realized order as a 
good the bartender wants to get access to, and if we imagine that the bar is so 
divided that the bartender has a space reorganized the way Clark described on the 
left, and a space lacking this kind of organization on the right, we can also get a 
sense of how the expected location (thought of in a more abstract way here, of 
course) of the drinks on the left is closer than the respective expected locations of 
the drinks on the right. There is simply less cognitive and practical “friction,” we 
might say, on the left, thus accessing the goods (getting the drinks done) on the left 
is less costly in terms of cognitive costs.
The decrease of cognitive costs is possible, I argue, thanks to the specific quality 
of the cognitive niche uncovered in Sect. 8.7 – thanks to the fact that it niches 
K. Werner

183
ignorance in the sense that our built-in cognitive limitations “mask” the complexity 
of our surroundings, thereby producing a certain emergent practical knowledge and 
an emergent presentation of the world.
Therefore, with all these specific aspects of the cognitive niche in mind, let us go 
back to the puzzle of institutions. I propose that institutions are in principle develop-
ments of the more practical, i.e., not accuracy-oriented, but cost-reducing and 
ignorance-­based aspect of the cognitive niche. Therefore, as already pointed out 
several times in the first part of the chapter, institutions are there to lower the access 
costs, thereby making the expected location of the resources/goods we prefer as 
close as possible. And, clearly, some institutions may do the job better than others.
To imagine the latter difference, go back to Fig. 8.3 and suppose that the left side 
of S is governed by one institution, Inst 1, while the right side is governed by a dif-
ferent one, Inst. 2. We can imagine this situation as if someone lived exactly on the 
border between two countries (in real life this happens in the EU, even if not with 
such a strict precision, but think of people living, for example, in the Polish city of 
Cieszyn and those living in Český Těšín in Czechia, just next to the border). Now, 
the fact that Inst. 2 works better, say, than Inst. 1 can be represented within this 
Hotelling-inspired graphic model in the form of a difference between the expected 
locations of two identical goods S wants to get access to. Suppose that S needs to 
see a doctor and there are two walk-in health centers, one located on the left, as part 
of Inst.1 – say, H1; and the other one, H2, located on the right as part of Inst.2. The 
distance from S to both facilities is the same, and we can even assume for the sake 
of simplicity that the relevant physical infrastructure is also identical. From this 
point on, however, certain differences begin to show up. First, regarding S’s insur-
ance: in H2 S must only present a photo ID, and payment will be automatically 
attributed to the insurer, while in H1 it is necessary to pay first, and then, perhaps 
the same day, S will be reimbursed by the insurer. The point is that since there is no 
significant delay in the reimbursement, we can assume that the difference is not 
actually in the effective cost S has to bear, but in the organization of the two pay-
ments and the obvious practical advantage of the automatic payment. Further on, in 
H2, the line of patients and the work of doctors and staff is organized in such a way 
that all the basic services, including the initial medical examination, are made by the 
staff, and then a doctor comes in just to do their job in 5 min; while in H1, doctors 
need to do the whole job, including such things as writing prescriptions, printing 
them, etc. This clearly makes the difference as to how long S will wait for the ser-
vice in both facilities. All such conditions considered, I argue that the expected 
location of H1 is different from the expected location of H2, assuming that H1 and 
H2 stand not so much for objects, health centers as buildings, in this case, but in fact 
for the goods offered there, i.e., medical services. The good that S needs, a medical 
help in this case, is more accessible at point H2, thus it comes at a lesser cost – its 
expected location is therefore closer to S on Fig. 8.3. Here, the accuracy of estima-
tion as to where H1 and H2 really are is not even an issue. The issue is this: How a 
particular organization of human behavior locates the resource/good that S wants to 
get access to.
8  Institutions as Cognitive Niches: A Dynamic of Knowledge and Ignorance

184
The situation just described is grossly simplified, of course, but it does happen 
that people chose the institutional framework they prefer to belong to. We can model 
this way, for example, people’s choices as to emigration; or their choices as to 
whether to put their kids within the framework of public education (where the good 
is a certain portion of knowledge, say) or the institutional framework of private 
schools.
Here is my main point: institutions should be thought of as developments of cog-
nitive niches, whose goal is to make a given resource/good accessible through a 
certain organization of behavior such as services of various kinds, transactions or 
various kinds, etc. Yet how this organization is achieved – whether it is thanks to 
abstract rules being imposed on the behavior, as the rule-following approach pro-
poses, or due to the equilibrium of expectations emerging in the behavioral domain 
at stake, or perhaps in some other way, too – is a secondary issue. This is not sup-
posed to mean that this is a less important issue since, from a practical angle, it is 
crucial and actually decides on which institution works better, but it is not to be 
conflated with the question of what an institution as such is.
Therefore, institutions thought of in this way, are relatively stable emergent prod-
ucts of structural coupling maintained by humans; in particular – emergent products 
of structurally coupled ignorance as characterized in Sect. 8.7. They “mask” the 
complexity of infrastructure and behavior, just like perception “masks” the com-
plexity of our physical surrounding, thereby making segments of it cognitively 
accessible. We can understand this institutional “masking” in the following way: in 
all cases where some infrastructure and behavior are supposed to make a specific 
good accessible, there is a certain complexity involved: the complexity of infra-
structure coupled with the complexity of behavior. Now, “carving up” within this 
complexity, by analogy with the perceptual “carving up” described in Sect. 8.7, can 
be understood as choosing specific patterns in which the complexity is supposed to 
work. We can assume that the complexity itself, if measured by some gauge, is the 
same in the case of accessing H1 and the case of accessing H2, yet, in H2, the 
patient goes through it so smoothly that they are not aware of it so much. In this 
sense, the complexity is successfully “masked,” unlike in H1 – here the complexity 
is painfully experienced at each step.
So, here is my general posit, one that merits much more theoretical effort, and 
could only be provisionally rolled out here:
Institutions are (i) cognitive niches (or developments thereof), i.e., emergent prod-
ucts of structural coupling between agents and infrastructure, which includes – 
crucially – emergent products of cognitive-behavioral limitations, thus emergent 
products of a certain ignorance (these products can be norms or patterns of 
behavior, as well as various combinations of them). These emergent products of 
ignorance (ii) are dedicated to “mask” the complexity of the structural coupling 
at stake. Alternatively – institutions are (i*) cognitive niches making specific 
fragments of the world available as goods by decreasing cognitive access costs 
of getting them. The latter is achieved (ii*) thanks to placing the expected loca-
tion of these goods as close to the agent as possible.

8.10  Institutions, Ignorance and Some Further Concerns
Finally, let me emphasize again this somewhat surprising idea: institutions are not 
there to decrease our ignorance as to where the goods are. Rather, they manage our 
ignorance by providing a certain scaffold on our actions within the realm of ignora-
mus et ignorabimus. As I said, accuracy of estimations as to where the goods are or 
what they are is one possible target of the construction of a cognitive niche; but 
there is also another target which is making access to these things as doable, as 
efficient as possible, assuming that we know about them at least as much as neces-
sary to form a need for them. The latter kind of cognitive niche builds upon the 
former, clearly, for the former must do the most fundamental job of bringing the 
things to a presentation, making them available to our cognitive capacities. Yet the 
institutional, praxis-oriented development of this most fundamental cognitive niche 
differs from all other developments, which are rather accuracy-oriented (here we 
can talk of scientific practices which can be considered collaborative cognitive 
niches, etc.).
The cognitive niche that concerns us here is of a strictly practical matter, not a 
theoretical matter, as perhaps Kant would say (being concerned with the theoretical 
vs. practical distinction very much). The whole concept is “Kantian” also in the 
sense in which some sort of limitation is necessarily attributable to any theoretical 
endeavor, as Kant insisted, thus to any accuracy-oriented cognitive niche, meaning 
that we inevitably are due to act in the realm of ignoramus et ignorabimus, however 
well-done our estimations are. And the cognizable phenomena, distinguished by 
Kant from presumed things in themselves, are, we might say, products of this limita-
tion. However, there is another sphere, in addition to the theoretical one, and irre-
ducible to the latter, that we should take care of – the domain of action. In this 
practical sphere, limitations are what Kant would refer to as rational maxims 
(imperatives) of the practical reason. Approached from a different angle – first, a 
social one, but also a situated/embodied one  – these limitations give rise to 
institutions.
One might come up with a question as to whether it makes any sense within this 
praxis-oriented development of the cognitive niche to speak of a real or actual loca-
tion of the goods, distinguished from their expected locations. After all, what could 
“actual location” mean in this context? I will defend the utility of this notion; how-
ever, we have to be aware that this is a theoretical fiction, rough and ready to do a 
certain job. Namely, the utility of such a concept becomes apparent, I argue, when 
we realize that there may be a need to conceptualize not only that certain institutions 
can do a worse job than others in the pursuit of rendering the goods closer, but that 
some of them can actually work in the opposite direction, thus at least for some 
selected groups of people render the access less likely, thus more costly, as if block-
ing them from getting the goods. If so, a promising and simple way of articulating 
the latter case is to say that an institution of this kind places the expected location of 
the good farther from the consumer than the real/actual location of the good is. But 
8  Institutions as Cognitive Niches: A Dynamic of Knowledge and Ignorance

186
in order to be able to say that, we need some notion of the actual location as the 
point of reference.
There is no place to develop this thought, but it is important to at least mention 
that we should be able within such a framework to grasp the core characteristics of 
various institutionalized or systemic inequalities, as they are referred to nowadays, 
such as systemic/institutional income disparity, systemic racism, various kinds of 
segregation and apartheid, etc. In all cases, the crux seems to be the pursuit of mak-
ing it less likely for various people to access certain goods, in the sense that these 
people themselves perceive the goods as hardly accessible. Hence, the core of the 
problem seems to be a certain manipulation of the expected locations of these goods 
in a way that is beneficial to some groups – those maintaining power over institu-
tions – and detrimental to others. I have to leave this topic at this point, though, and 
keep it for another occasion.
8.11  Conclusion
This essay had one major goal: to provide an initial and provisional articulation of 
a relatively new account of institutions. The most important features of this account 
are the following. First, I argued briefly that the two major accounts of institutions 
that are present in the literature are not sufficient, for while they address the ques-
tion of how institutions enable us to access specific goods, they don’t deal with an 
even deeper issue of how specific entities become accessible as goods in the first 
place. Meanwhile, the latter may also be a function of institutions.
Secondly, with that in mind, I decided, first, to approach institution from a cogni-
tive perspective, yet not the traditional, representationalist one, but one more envi-
ronmentally oriented and biologically informed. From this angle, I proposed that it 
is possible to define institutions as specific developments of niches, especially cog-
nitive niches. The latter were, for the sake of this chapter, characterized in a sketchy 
but, I hope, sufficient way. Namely, cognitive niches are relatively stable emergent 
products of structural coupling between organisms and their surroundings. 
Alternatively, cognitive niches were characterized in term of costs: they decrease 
the costs attributable to accessing certain entities.
Third, the role of ignorance as a constitutive ingredient of any cognitive niche 
was elicited, with references to relevant literature. I proposed that within cognitive 
niches, ignorance has a somewhat paradoxical role of producing practical knowledge. 
Fourth, and finally, it turns out that institutions, understood as cognitive niches, 
can also be targeted as bringing forth such knowledge-from-ignorance compounds 
at a higher level of social complexity, based on patterns of behavior and certain 
fixed infrastructural factors. Institutions differ in terms of how much they succeed 
or fail in making certain entities available as goods  – how much they decrease 
access costs, thereby, in a sense, “masking” the complexity of social interactions. 
Intuitively speaking, within a well-functioning institution, the goods seem closer to 
agents than they really are given the state of infrastructure and the complexity of the

whole process of getting access to them; they lead the agent smoothly through this 
complexity, thereby making room for practical knowledge, somewhat paradoxically 
based on the agent’s ignorance.

How Do We Think about the Unknown? 
The Self-Awareness of Ignorance as a Tool 
for Managing the Anguish of Not Knowing

Abstract  This chapter offers a revision of the concept of ignorance discussed in 
recent models of abduction. Both ignorance preservation (GW-schema) and the ten-
tative explanationism (AKM-schema) will be reanalyzed from an ecological and 
distributed perspective on cognition, instead coherent with the so-called EC-Model 
of abduction. We are convinced that a successful revision of the notion of ignorance 
in both AKM-schema and GW-schema of abduction can be exactly realized thanks 
to the EC-model. These theories present ignorance as an absence that occurs when 
the agents cannot reach useful explanations of a phenomenon in their epistemic 
environment. This absence surprises them, and this emotion triggers agents’ abduc-
tive reasoning, which, in turn, mitigates their ignorance. Abduction offers the agents 
a guessed “provisional” hypothesis capable to solve the ignorance-problem. 
However, both the state of being ignorant of something and the mitigation of not-­
knowing are complex processes. If we describe the agents as parts of cognitive 
systems, we can see them as engaged with the so-called affordances, which always 
provide qualitative and procedural information capable to help and trigger abduc-
tive inferential processes. We will argue that when a possible relation with the fact, 
which is investigated is unknown, and so affordances are absent – and consequently 
“unknown” – the lack of available knowledge is absolute. When this happens, the

agent is compelled to abduce from an unknown affordance: In this case, it is the 
agents’ self-awareness of their ignorance that plays a role of a helpful tool. The

hypothesis will be more strongly supported by the motivation and will of the agent 
than by the cognitive role played by commonly accepted data and will be formed by 
unusual intuitions and data considered strange or exceptional. We will illustrate that

eral principles of research integrity related to the role of cognizant’s responsibility

9.1  Introduction
This chapter offers a revision of the concept of ignorance discussed in recent models 
of abduction. Both ignorance preservation (GW-schema of abduction) and the tenta-
tive explanationism (AKM-schema of abduction) will be reanalyzed from a distrib-
uted perspective on cognition, which is instead coherent with the so-called 
EC-Model (Eco-Cognitive Model of Abduction). GW and AKM schemas present 
ignorance as an absence that occurs when the agents cannot reach useful explana-
tions of a phenomenon thanks to the epistemic background: this event tends to sur-
prise them, and the related emotion triggers agents’ abductive reasoning, which, in 
turn, mitigates their ignorance.
Abduction offers agents a guessed “provisional” hypothesis which is used to 
solve the ignorance problem. However, both the state of being ignorant of some-
thing and the mitigation of not-knowing are complex processes: how agents start 
from a lack of knowledge and then become aware of their own ignorance is a cogni-
tive process worth further studying. If we describe the agents as parts of a distrib-
uted cognitive system, we can see them as engaged with various kinds of 
“affordances” (see below), which provide them qualitative and procedural informa-
tion on their environment. The agents’ interactions with these pieces of information 
define how the epistemic process will occur. From this point of view, an ignorance 
problem emerges when agents do not recognize (or know) some part of the informa-
tion they perceptually obtained. So, this situation triggers in the agents different 
managing strategies: this chapter will focus on abductive reasoning as a key tool in 
generating hypotheses.
We must add that there are strange cases in which the lack of knowledge is abso-
lute. An example we will address is the Phaistos Disc, an archaeological artifact 
about which the experts do not know anything. This kind of lack of knowledge can

cause anguish, to the point of considering the situation unbelievable as a unique 
novelty. However, when this happens, the agents can still perform an abduction 
about an unknown affordance, which triggers the emergence of new hypotheses. As 
we already stated, the example discussed in this chapter is that of the Phaistos Disc. 
The discovery of this artifact triggered mixed ideas because of the strangeness of its 
symbolic characteristics and the difficulties in dating the object, in understanding 
the context in which it had been found, and in constructing a satisfactory historical 
account. It is a case of absence of affordances – affordances are unknown – a situa-
tion that usually causes anguish given the fact the artifact involves a crucial diffi-
culty in the investigation but also because it emotionally affects the agent’s 
motivations and beliefs.1 The hypothetical result is not founded on the opportunities 
offered by the entity at play or by the fact under investigation. On the contrary, since 
the hypothesis is elaborated on “unknown affordances,” it must be assumed that it is 
the agent that has to create appropriate chances of cognizing. Archaeology remains 
an ideal discipline to explain this case because of its constant use of abductive 
reasoning.
In this process, the agent’s relationship between the self-awareness of being 
ignorant and his subsequent judgments is a key to understanding the apparent para-
dox of someone who becomes knowledgeable of his own ignorance. The agents’ 
self-awareness of their ignorance (the process of understanding that one is ignorant 
of something) is a cognitive tool with which agents can manage both the specific 
problem about which they are ignorant and the distress with which they live this 
cognitive situation.
The first section of this chapter will illustrate the agents’ self-awareness of their 
ignorance as a form of not knowing related to philosophical questions that cannot 
be fully answered. In the subsequent paragraphs, an attempt will be made to study 
the crucial difference between the classical philosophical aspects of ignorance and 
the views on the subject provided by the studies on scientific discovery offered by 
the twentieth century tradition of philosophy of science. We will describe that the 
use of abduction in archaeology fits the characters of “discovery” as described in 
those classical epistemological debates. From this perspective, every archaeological 
finding fulfills the requirements of the patterns of recognition we will describe in 
Sect. 9.3. Interestingly, this is true even for those cases where one wants to undo this 
link. Cases such as the Phaistos Disc (Sect. 9.3.3) offer the chance of showing the 
limits of the available perspectives on the analysis of the relationships between 
abduction and ignorance and the starting point to make a further philosophical 
reflection on them.
1 Kierkegaard’s already stressed the role of anguish as “dizziness of freedom.” According to him, 
anguish opens the possibility of freedom, understood as a possibility, an expression that refers to 
the experience of absolute freedom of choice. Kierkegaard proposes the example of looking into 
an abyss: in this, a person will feel fear the possibility of falling and throwing himself off the cliff. 
Taking personal responsibility for our actions (to jump or not into the abyss) leads to self-con-
sciousness (Kierkegaard, 1980: 61).
9  How Do We Think about the Unknown? The Self-Awareness of Ignorance as a Tool…

194
In Sect. 9.3, we will also argue that the agents’ self-awareness of their ignorance 
obviously emerges as a helpful tool in situations where that which is ignored at first 
does not generate expectations, exactly as in the case of the Phaistos Disc (Sect. 
9.3.3). Full self-awareness of ignorance triggers “unusual” opportunities that favor 
“unusual” abductive reasoning to manage the situation. Moreover, as we will argue 
in Sect. 9.4, the agent may experience these situations with a high degree of anguish 
exactly because his hypothesis will be constructed taking advantage of a full self-­
consciousness of ignorance. For example, the abductive hypothesis will be formed 
by odd intuitions and by accessory data considered strange or exceptional. Therefore, 
this hypothesis will be strongly supported more by the motivation and will of the 
agent than by the cognitive role played by commonly accepted data. We will illus-
trate that in these cases, the management of anxiety and control of it is committed 
to general principles of research integrity related to the role of cognizant’s respon-
sibility for his own actions.
9.2  Two Forms of Ignorance
As is well known, the self-consciousness of ignorance is one of the founding pre-
cepts of philosophy. The union between the famous Delphic sentence “know thy-
self” (Greek: γνῶθι σεαυτόν), and the Socratic phrase “I know that I know nothing” 
(Greek: ἓν οἶδα ὅτι οὐδὲν οἶδα) makes it clear that the beginning of philosophy is 
precisely related to “not knowing and wanting to know” (Colli, 1978). These two 
epistemic states are the two main poles that articulated the Socratic dialectic known 
as maieutic. A classic solution of a related paradox is illustrated in Plato’s Meno 
dialogue and regards how we can know that a new thing known is that which we did 
not know previously (Plato, 1924: Men. 80d): indeed, the paradox concerns the 
dichotomy between knowing or not knowing and the well-known solution is the 
postulation of the role of reminiscence.
It is well known that Aristotle, who for Raffaello Sanzio was the philosopher 
who pointed to the importance of physis (φύσις), devoted much of his work to cap-
ture the essence of reasoning by characterizing the form of inference known as a 
syllogism. It is thanks to the new theory of syllogism that Aristotle introduced the 
notion of demonstration into the philosophical knowledge of ancient Greece. It is in 
this framework that aspects of Plato’s idea can be reframed. Indeed, in Plato’s dia-
logue Meno, three epistemological questions are illustrated:
	1.	 How to identify what is known with what we did not know?
	2.	 How to know something we do not know at all?
	3.	 Can virtue be taught?
Socrates himself only manages to give a positive answer to the first two. The third, 
which he cannot answer by identifying virtue with knowledge (for then it could be 
taught, as the Sophists do), is explained by a sort of divine inspiration (like poetic 
inspiration) and the doctrine of reminiscence also plays a central role.
A. Sans Pinillos and L. Magnani

195
On the contrary, there is no more solution to the three questions in terms of remi-
niscence in the case of Aristotle. Aristotle solves the third question regarding the 
Socratic hypothesis that virtue is knowledge as a case of reasoning from hypotheti-
cal inference, that is abduction – as described in detail in Magnani (2021a) – as a 
kind of plausible solution, which only reaches the status of “possibility.” Aristotle 
concludes that if we assume the rule that “whatever is knowledge, can be taught” 
and take the fact that “virtue is knowledge,” then we can hypothetically infer 
(abduce) the case that “virtue can be taught” (Aristotle, 1964: Anal. Pr.: II 25 20–35).
The above notes concerning Plato and Aristotle help us to introduce two forms of 
ignorance: the ignorance in the investigation of nature, of the world in which we 
live, and the ignorance of genuine philosophical questions. The latter are not sus-
ceptible to getting easy answers. As already said, this character of the genuine philo-
sophical questions is envisaged by Socrates: In this perspective, questions about 
these matters end in an aporia. Aporia is important because it indicates a path, a 
pedagogical product of the dialectical process of the maieutic dialogue, but not a 
simple answer that can be seen as the result of a neat problem-solving process. So, 
the main philosophical questions do not refer to mere problem-solving processes 
but to problems that affect our entire approach to life. Their status as unanswered 
questions gives them a crucial role as definers of what we can call the “cosmovision”2 
in which we live because they give meaning to particular inquiries from a broad and 
unfinished spectrum. For example, we will explain below that self-awareness of 
ignorance is an abductive process that predisposes us to continue investigating 
blindly because we do not foresee a resolution in the short term.
The way ignorance operates in the case of problem-solving processes can be 
characterized, in the perspective of abductive cognition, as a “trigger.” Abduction 
can be understood as a process of generating and selecting hypotheses, conjectures, 
options, etc. with the aim of inferring a fruitful cognitive outcome endowed with 
special cognitive virtues. The first contemporary reformulation of abduction was 
made by Charles Sanders Peirce, who proposed it to explain how we deal with the 
explanation of certain evidence (Peirce, 1958: 5.188–189, 7.202). “Surprise” is the 
classic example Peirce used as a trigger – favored by curiosity – to explain a puz-
zling fact thanks to the postulation of a hypothesis through abduction. In this sense, 
abduction arises in puzzling situations in which it is not sufficient or possible to find 
an explanation taking advantage of already available knowledge, but it is necessary 
to “suppose” something to make sense of the surprise: “doubt, usually, perhaps 
always, takes its rise from surprise, which supposes previous belief; and surprises 
come with novel environment” (Peirce, 1958: 5.512).
Although abduction is often characterized exploiting logical abstract models, it 
should not be forgotten that a logical perspective suffers from not being able to 
account for the psychological role played by the “triggers” in favoring discoveries 
of new hypotheses (Thagard, 1988: 56). Consequently, although a general formal

understand it as a worldview.

scheme may be helpful to explain that triggers are generators of expectations 
(Aliseda, 2006: 47), it is also necessary to consider other aspects, such as, for exam-
ple, surprise, that are inherent to the human being as an abductive agent. So to 
speak, surprise occurs, because we are surprised.
Similarly, ignorance occurs because we ignore it. It seems trivial, but it is not. 
From a cognitive point of view, the triggers (and of course also the various related 
constraints) present aspects that significantly enrich the perspective that situates the 
human being as a cognizant of a world that it constitutes with his actions. In the case 
of surprise as a trigger, we can distinguish forms, intensities, and the different con-
texts that embed it: to make an example, surprise can be understood as an event that 
violates a pre-existing belief (Gabbay & Woods, 2005: 82). In this sense, surprise 
initiates a highly original and creative doxastic process, aiming at giving birth to 
something new.
In the perspective we have just illustrated also, ignorance can be understood as a 
trigger for abduction. First of all, in the case of the so-called AKM scheme of abduc-
tion3, ignorance begins to dissolve through the inference – abductive – of tentative 
explanations. Although it is necessary to emphasize the provisionality of such 
explanations, their primary value is to overcome surprise and propose possible solu-
tions. The GW scheme of abduction (Gabbay & Woods, 2005: § 3.3) in turn places 
ignorance as constitutive of the human being’s life. From a cognitive point of view, 
it can be assumed that, just as we are always ignorant to some degree, to some 
degree we also know something. This is the property called “preservation of igno-
rance.” As can be observed, there is, for example, an intimate psychological rela-
tionship between surprise and ignorance, for both “are connected to the different 
interpretations of ignorance the agent is preserving, and exploiting, during the 
abductive process” (Arfini, 2019: 101).
A short digression concerning the distinction between ignorance-preserving and 
knowledge-enhancing character of abduction has to be added. Contrarily to the GW 
scheme proposed by Gabbay and Woods, which emphasizes the “ignorance preserv-
ing” character of abduction, Magnani (2017) further indicates that even if ignorance 
is preserved in the above sense, abduction is also “knowledge-enhancing,” because 
new truths can be and “are” discovered which are not necessarily best explanations 
intended as hypotheses, which are empirically tested. Peirce himself notes that 
abductive guesses are belief-inducing and truth making. Not only, it cannot be said 
that unevidenced belief is itself evidence of malfunction and disorder, and so source 
of falsification. Magnani illustrates the case of conventions, extremely important in 
physics, evidentially inert fruits of abduction – at least from the point of view of 
their impossible falsification  – but nevertheless knowledge-enhancing. Another 
3 The classical schematic representation of abduction is expressed by what Gabbay and Woods 
(2005) call AKM-schema, which is contrasted to their own (GW-schema), which we are explaining 
in this section. For A they refer to Aliseda (1997, 2006), for K to Kowalski (1979), Kakas et al. 
(1993), Kuipers (1999), for M to Magnani (2001), and Meheus et al. (2002). A detailed abductive 
structure illustration of the AKM schema is given in an article written by Magnani (2009, Chap. 2, 
Sect. 2.1.3).

example is provided by the role of some models in science when they are active in 
the core abductive discovery processes as constitutive of new scientific frameworks 
and new empirical domains. The abduction of these models in science is epistemi-
cally productive: models are just inert in the perspective of a direct empirical signifi-
cance, but they play a “causal” role in producing new discoveries: scientific models 
can be empirically false, but they are not fictions, instead they are knowledge-­
enhancing devices, which play an important role in reaching empirically fecund 
knowledge. It is clear here we are dealing with cases in which abduction is not 
ignorance-preserving.4
It is also possible to consider ignorance as a second-order trigger because it links 
the psychological aspect with the empirical one: we can say that experimentation 
and the possibility of obtaining sensible knowledge are always mediated by a degree 
of ignorance. Arfini proposes that ignorance generates an event that propitiates 
opportunities to not only discover and explore (Arfini, 2019: 102) but also to act 
(ibid., 103). The relevance of the action lies in the fact that it is exactly thanks to it 
that the part of information that has been ignored can be detected: we know that we 
ignore something by the way we can interact with it.
To enrich the details of this approach, an illustration of those kinds of abductive 
cognition that take advantage of action on an external environment is necessary. For 
this reason, the EC-Model of abduction (Magnani, 2017) is proposed as the corner-
stone of our approach. From this perspective, it is possible to exploit the concept of 
abduction to better understand in which cases ignorance occurs through the analysis 
of the cognitive interaction with the environment.
Taking advantage of the classical perspective in terms of affordances (see Gibson, 
1979; Varela et al., 2017), the contextualized action that aims at producing abduc-
tive hypotheses thanks to processes of signification that occurs through the given 
manipulation (contextualized action) generates variations of interaction that are 
conducive to a special “chances generator” type of relationship (Arfini, 2019: 115). 
Here, the action is motivated by an abduced hypothesis about the opportunity 
offered by ignorance and the fact of knowing that we ignored (usually shown by the 
state of surprise).
The eco-cognitive approach to abduction also re-evaluates the cognitive role of 
instinct. In this perspective, we do not have as a consequence, as some commenta-
tors seem to maintain (Rescher, 1995; Hoffmann 1999; Paavola 2005), that instinct – 
as a type of enigmatic, not evaluated, guessing force – “does not” produce effects at 
the level of conscious inferences such as in the case of scientific cognition. We think 
a more satisfactory interpretation is the following: we do not have to consider 
instinct as an enigmatic endowment of being like us but as a simple cognitive capac-
ity that is at the basis of both “practical” and scientific cognition, in turn instinct 
shows the obvious root of both in natural evolution. If every type of cognitive pro-
cess is rooted in a hybrid interplay with external resources and representations, 
4 Woods recently acknowledged the importance of the knowledge-enhancing character of abduc-
tion in Woods (2021).

198
which show their characteristic constraints and facets, it does not have to appear 
anymore surprising that
[…] the instincts conducive to the assimilation of food, and the instincts conducive to repro-
duction, must have involved from the beginning certain tendencies to think truly about 
physics, on the one hand, and about psychics, on the other. It is somehow more than a mere 
figure of speech to say that nature fecundates the mind of man with ideas which, when those 
ideas grow up, will resemble their father, Nature (Peirce, 1958, 5.591).
As a consequence, if we adopt an evolutionary perspective, instincts have to be seen 
as entrenched in humans in this intertwining between internal and external features, 
and so it is natural to realize that externalities (“Nature”) “fecund” the mind. In this 
intellectual framework, abduction incarnates the most fascinating product of this 
“fecundated” mind.
After having illustrated various basic aspects of the concept of ignorance in its 
intertwining with abductive cognition, we have at our disposal the fundamental 
tools that we need to go ahead and further display other more unusual cognitive 
roles of the “unknown.”
9.3  Abduction Without Total Ignorance
To present an example that can further explain and simplify what we have just delin-
eated, the case of archaeological studies can be useful. Following Shelley’s (1996) 
perspective, archaeology is a discipline in which abduction plays a predominant 
role. The reason for this is that archaeology is always concerned with a continuous 
management of uncertainty (also because often crucial data are ignored). Then 
archaeologists have to exploit their imagination, creativity, and other resources to 
the aim of building hypotheses that will allow them to develop their research. There 
are two aspects that characterize this process as abductive:
	(a)	 Abduced hypotheses are important for introducing new lines of scientific 
investigation.
	(b)	 Hypotheses cannot be accepted solely on the basis of the abduced mechanism 
(ibid. 278).
Both aspects represent two fundamental features of abduction (Kapitan, 1997): 
hypothesis formation (Woods, 2011: 244) and hypothesis testing (Gabbay & Woods, 
2005: sec. 3.9) in the context of scientific discovery (Magnani, 2017: 10, 2021b).
Shelley sees abduction at work in archaeology at the level of scientific observa-
tion (he calls this inferential process “visual abduction”), in which mental tem-
plates – patterns that are applied as recognition processes – operate in identifying 
what is recognized and what is ignored and at the same time in finding some plau-
sible properties that nevertheless preserve a certain degree of ignorance. It is well

known that focusing the process discovery at the simple level of observation was 
certainly already stressed by a great part of the epistemological tradition 
(e.g., Hanson, 1958; Popper, 2002; Kowalski, 1994): however, this kind of hypo-
thetical visual inference can be better characterized thanks to the Peircean concept 
of abduction (CP. 5.14–40). Based on this conception of scientific discovery in 
archaeology, Shelley (1996: 280) identifies 4 kinds of abductive processes:
	1.	 Recognition of objects as of theoretical significance (classical abduction)
	2.	 Abduction on shapes of objects (which can provide insight on the causal history 
capable to situate the object under investigation in a context)
	3.	 Abduction on structure of objects (which is the representation of the object-­
based exclusively on its structure)
	4.	 Analogical inference, which refers to a novel hypothesis when constructed anal-
ogously to a known one
In particular, the type of hypotheses to be put forward by archaeologists must offer 
an explanation that makes sense of the objects they are studying, as well as their 
distribution in the context.
9.3.1  Situating Ignorance
The most significant specificity of analogy is that it seems to operate even without 
the recognition made possible by the causal history, provided by strategy two, that 
places the object under investigation in a context (ibid., 293). Shelley’s intention is 
clearly addressed to characterize those situations in which, faced with the impossi-
bility of directly recognizing something by historical dating, the rule of analogy is 
triggered, which allows the generation of novel hypotheses. An example is the gen-
eration of hypotheses about the function of technology starting from the character-
istics of the surrounding fauna and vegetation (ibid., 294). It is well known that 
analogy is governed by symmetry; that is, similar structures have similar solutions 
by generalization and particularization.5 However, following van Frassen’s work, 
there is also a kind of asymmetry between explanations and analogies: to become 
acceptable explanations, analogies need something more (van Frassen, 1980: Ch. 5).
What is important to see here is that analogy – when in an unknown situation – 
becomes an abductive resource when exploited to obtain data that make possible the 
generation of a story that ends up conjugating with a “history.”
5 Particularization refers here to the mechanisms that govern the application in science of the mean-
ings and values generally shared in a society (contextual meanings and values) (c.f., Longino, 1983).

9.3.2  Peirce: Ignorance at the Basis of Perception 
and the Pragmatic View of Science
Peirce himself places the hypothesis at the basis of perception (1958: 2.619–644), 
which is characterized socially and culturally through the semiotic relations with 
habits (Cannizano & Anderson, 2016). Peirce’s pragmatism situates the agent at the 
center of the investigation in the philosophy of science: it is essential to keep in 
mind that the scientific researcher lives in the community where he does science 
and, therefore, his generated hypotheses will be intelligible to the extent that they 
are intelligible in that context. Likewise, the goal of scientific investigation will aim 
at building a shared cosmovision.6
Philosophy of science focuses primarily on the role of science in capturing the 
natural order of events, which are only cognizable on a provable scale by the stan-
dardized rules of scientific methodology: in this perspective, ignorance is conceived 
as an ordinary stage of research, which, if correctly developed, can lead to a solution.
However, ignorance can be epistemologically seen from another perspective: 
ignorance can play the role of an experience of the researcher, which forces him to 
make decisions different from those contemplated by the received and epistemo-
logical view. Let us explain what characterize this kind of ignorance.
The need for science to have concrete objectives and a defined end is the key to 
understanding concepts that inform scientific methodology, such as, for example, 
rigor, truth, exception, etc. It is also the way to situate the state of ignorance and 
what is ignored within a research project. In other words, in the process of defining 
a research project (defining objectives, interests, needs, etc.), what we know about 
it and what we do not know about it emerge. Abductive hypotheses (e.g., reached 
thanks to analogy) can be considered tools related to a problem of mere workable-
ness (James, 1987: 826) that – disregarding problems of truth, rigor, simplicity, 
etc. – scientists can develop inside the cosmovision belonging to a particular inves-
tigation. In this perspective, some hypotheses are considered tools and may become 
a part of a specific methodology, as, for example, described by Feyerabend (1967):
Bohr’s atomic model was introduced, and retained, in the face of precise and unshakeable 
contrary evidence (1993: 40). [...] In speculating about the prospects of some line of inves-
tigation, he would dismiss the usual consideration of simplicity, elegance or even consis-
tency with the remark that such qualities can only be properly judged after the event 
(ibid., 15n).7
For example, making an analogy arises by suspending certain similarities and 
assuming others. These operations are made possible by the conceptual framework 
provided by the cosmovision where the research takes place, which is always 
6 We use the term “cosmovision” to refer to the unified image of the world that arises from the 
biological and sociocultural interpretation of the environment. While a “worldview” is based on 
perception, a “cosmovision” arises from living together in a society with other people, so it encom-
passes both its biological and sociocultural aspects (Magnani et al., 2021).
7 Here Feyerabend is quoting Rozental (1967: 117).

impregnated with customs, artistic conceptions, standards of taste, and an entire 
collective imaginary. Of course, this same constellation of meanings contemplates 
the role of not knowing.
In sum, just as there is a history of knowledge that has been established, and so 
to speak, of human progress, there is a parallel history of the challenges that have 
been experienced. The fact that the former predominates over the latter obfuscates 
that strong epistemic disengagement we are addressing in this chapter and that is 
occurring when ignorance is experienced with an extremely high intensity so that a 
“special” path must be taken to confront it.
9.3.3  At My Signal, Unleash Hypotheses: The Case 
of the Phaistos Disc
The Phaistos Disc (see Fig. 9.1) (middle Minoan period, approximately 1400 BC) 
is categorized as a clay tablet or as an artifact: general terms to say that “is some-
thing we do not know.” It is a significant case to be considered here because of its 
unique character, a kind of paradigmatic phenomenon. In general terms, everything 
is known about the context of this disc, but it is still today a mystery (Balistier, 
2000). Plain and simple, one has no idea what it is or what it is for. It is a clay disc 
with unknown inscriptions that, in our opinion, contains a sequence of signs.
This artifact has occasioned hundreds of hypotheses, which have been contrasted 
based on various criteria: unfortunately, none of these hypotheses, generated through 
different processes, many of them abductive, have led to an accepted result. Most of 
these studies focus on the idea that the disc represents a recorded code (Godart, 
1990 and, more recently, Duhoux, 2000), that it can be related to some kind of musi-
cal writing (Younger, 2007). Nevertheless, maybe it is not writing, maybe it is just 
a joke or even a fraud (Eisenberg, 2008). The fundamental issue here is that there 
seems to be a limit to the number of hypotheses in the framework of a given

archaeological theory. Therefore, to change this situation, the archaeologist is even 
compelled to adopt a point of view extraneous to his discipline in order to be able to 
raise novel questions, the implementation of which would allow him to continue the 
investigation.
In the case of abduction, the more conventional strategies consist of those criteria 
already mentioned in the section above regarding logical constraints.8 These con-
straints are, for example, (1) the principle of economy, (2) the explanatory power of 
the hypotheses when tested, and (3) some kind of testability of them. In the words 
of Gabbay and Woods:
[…] Peirce supposes that there are three “leading principles” for the selection of hypotheses 
[…]. One is that the hypothesis should be generated with a view to its explanatory potential 
for some surprising fact or state of affairs […]. Another is that the hypothesis should be 
testable […]. The third such principle is that the abducer’s choice of hypothesis be made 
economically […] (Gabbay & Woods, 2005: 83).
The test comes from the constraints of economy and simplicity, which control the 
number of abduced hypotheses and their complexity. On the contrary, in the per-
spective of the EC-Model of abduction, the explanatory power should not be con-
sidered an intrinsic constraint of abduction but a contextual one (Park, 2017). It is 
essential to keep in mind that neither triggers nor constraints are instruments used at 
will but are cognitively structural because they hierarchize and mediate the way we 
interact with the environment (Gabbay & Woods, 2005: 84).
The process of making hypotheses in archaeology is very appropriate to explain 
situations in which there is a controlled interaction between prior knowledge and a 
novel situation but which, at the same time, can present a considerable degree of 
creativity. Let us see what happens in the case of the presence of a very strong 
degree of enduring ignorance.
9.4  Remaining in Ignorance Without any Forego
As has been seen, the characterization of weak (tentative, provisional) hypotheses 
through abduction is a much discussed topic today. Here it is important to note that 
the archaeological case presented in this chapter attributes a clear relevance to the 
emotional dimension of the agent in abductive processes. Faced with situations of 
ignorance such as those described in the previous section, which do not promise a 
resolution in the short term and even appear extraneous to the discipline from which 
it is explored, interest and passion are determinants of the character of the investiga-
tion. As we will explain in the following subsections, one of the strongest emotions 
of this personalization of the investigation is anguish. This emotion characterizes 
8 Some of these external constraints were considered by Peirce as quickly performed by “instinc-
tive” strategies, which would occur before conceptualization, when hypotheses are instantly 
reached by humans.

that moment in which the researcher prefers a fragile hypothesis (e.g., built on 
myths, rumors, and legends, as well as hypotheses formulated from disciplines con-
sidered too distant or of questionable reputation from the point of view of science) 
rather than abandoning the investigation.
9.4.1  The Existentialist Point of View of Ignorance
It should be noted that the role of surprise described in the case of the Phaistos Disc 
has also been documented in other cases of famous scientific discoveries such as the 
discovery of the planet Neptune (Hanson, 1958: 124-1n; Grosser, 1979; Sans 
Pinillos, 2017). Indeed, when Le Verrier hypothesized the planet, he tried to make 
sense of a situation of special ignorance. Le Verrier’s problem was displaced from 
the scientific questions of his time. However, there is a difference between the two 
cases. First, Le Verrier died without knowing whether his hypothesis was true or 
not, and second, we have to say that the idea of a new planet next to many other 
ordered planets was not exactly crazy. On the contrary, the case of the Phaistos Disc 
allows us to delve into an ignorance that endures and subsists precisely because, on 
the one hand, it is impossible to elaborate a satisfactory hypothesis and, on the other 
hand, because there is no way to corroborate the other hypotheses that have been 
discarded.
Although we are in presence of an object, there is neither a direct meaning (about 
what it is or on how to know what it is) nor an indirect one (e.g., heuristic resources 
capable to generate analogies, similarities, etc.). Thus, from a cognitive point of 
view, the agent is devoid of any affordance. In more specific terms, this object is 
experienced as a severe case of anomaly that allows only two actions: (1) disregard-
ing it or (2) starting a proliferation of hypotheses ad infinitum. Following Chemero’s 
perspective (2003), it is possible to say that both options show that the affordance 
has been lost because there is no real connection with the object, but only with the 
fact of ignoring it.
9.4.2  Anguish as a Continuous Trigger
By focusing our attention on the experience of ignorance, we can identify a new 
aspect that contributes to the irritation caused by not being able to make sense of 
something and that initiates the abductive process: anguish. We all know that 
anguish is linked to a pressing need to find a solution. However, primarily, there is 
the anguish of trying to make sense of a situation of ignorance. From a Sartrean 
point of view, it is possible to conceptualize this anguish in terms of the responsibil-
ity we assume with our actions (Sartre, 1966: 33). In the case at hand, this responsi-
bility grants the generation of “blind” hypotheses, thus jeopardizing our commitment 
to the basic principles of scientific methodology or temporarily suspending them 
9  How Do We Think about the Unknown? The Self-Awareness of Ignorance as a Tool…

204
and, at the same time, personal ethical/epistemic integrity in the development of a 
well-done investigation. In the case of the Phaistos Disc, this responsibility refers to 
the choice of that fragile hypothesis that we can make to guide our actions as we 
continue our investigation.
Anguish arises here because that which is ignored does not generate expecta-
tions. Taking James’ terminology (James, 1992: 458), the situation generates 
hypotheses that appear before us dead and trivial. It should be kept in mind that 
responsibility gives meaning here to hypothesizing without any guarantee. It is a 
choice in the face of a concrete situation that more personally involves us in the 
investigation. From a classical existentialist perspective, one could say that the satu-
ration of the “technical vision of the world” (that perspective which assumes that 
things in the world have a definite function) (Sartre, 1966: 18) makes possible a 
different way of understanding the situation of lived ignorance.
In this sense, the existentialist perspective better highlights the problem of the 
relationship between theory and praxis: in this case, we face a paradigm shift of the 
cosmovision. This happens thanks to a phenomenological experience of ignorance/
unawareness, which predisposes the agent to engage in investigation using the 
assumption that what we know is a small part of reality that is still unknown to us. 
This change of viewpoint characterizes the researchers as ignorant agents who want 
to know. From this perspective, responsibility acts as a provisional prescriptive con-
straint on the investigation to manage ignorance/unawareness: given the realization 
that our situation has been experienced by others long before us, then it also opens 
the possibility that we may know in the future what we do not know now (Kompridis, 
2006: 180).
9.4.3  Ignorance as an Opportunity
As is well known, Sartre’s sentence “l’existence précède l’essence” refers to the 
critique of the technical understanding of the world because it implies that things 
(and the world) do not have a predetermined finality. His criticism is aimed at Kant’s 
concept of human nature, whose universalization necessitates a harmony between 
human volition and laws of nature (Sartre, 1966: 19).
In situations of ignorance, such as in the case of the Phaistos Disc, however, there 
is no causal link between the will and laws of nature. Furthermore, under such cir-
cumstances, the agent must turn ignorance into an advantage. Here the significance 
of the chance of ignorance, according to Kierkegaard, rests in the fact that it creates 
an occasion for asking about what is unknown: “every point of departure in time is 
eo ipso accidental, an occasion, a vanishing moment” (1980: Ch. I, A IV, 205).
The presence of such an opportunity allows us to cease perceiving ignorance as 
the opposite of knowledge and to assume ourselves as ignorant. The consequent 
question “how do we think about ignorance?” proposes to the researcher that all the

current difficulties do not come from the object but from the discipline that investi-
gates it. Therefore, a complete and possibly fruitful change of perspective in research 
is possible and, even if he does not know how to do it at that moment, it will be 
worthwhile to commit himself to the cause of resolving the situation of ignorance.
9.5  Conclusions: How Do We Think about Ignorance?
This chapter aimed at successfully revising the notion of ignorance in both AKM-­
schema and GW-schema of abduction exploiting the epistemological and cognitive 
resources offered by the EC-model. Being able to further deepen in this perspective, 
the concept of ignorance is an extraordinary occasion that allows the agent to inter-
rogate himself about the circumstances that have led him to that puzzling situation 
and to take action on the matter at stake from a different and unusual point of view. 
The particular type of ignorance we have analyzed in the present text arises in situ-
ations in which we face the impossibility of saying something about what is 
unknown. In other words, the object is perceived outside the frame of reference so 
that it is not possible to trigger any reasoning to hypotheses appropriately coherent 
with a given cognitive disciplinary perspective. Consequently, the situation does not 
generate suggestions that could lead to a line of action to follow.
In a cognitive perspective, we can say that all affordances are lost, because there 
is not an actual connection with the object, but only with the ignorance of it. Faced 
with the anguish arising from the attempt to make sense of this situation, the agent 
may decide to keep the investigation open by blindly assuming the supposition that 
persevering in the inquiry will yield later results. In this case, the activity of making 
hypotheses is a special form of abductive cognition, which is characterized by 
invoking prescriptive values to solve descriptive questions.
The responsibility assumed in the face of the acts caused by the anguish is the 
one of the prescriptive values associated with the agent’s commitment to maintain 
the investigation open-ended. This condition leads to a parallel process of open-­
ended hypothesizing that includes a “teleological” aspect in the existing (causal) 
state of events, implying that if the study is done better, good results will be obtained.
Living ignorance provides the opportunity to rethink many of the principles that 
make sense of the world. Moreover, the self-consciousness of being ignorant opens 
the door to asking distinctive kinds of questions that not only serve to interrogate the 
current state of affairs, such as, for example, that of a given scientific discipline. 
These questions are known to be philosophical in the sense that, even if they will 
never be answered, they provide strategies to transform the world.

How Do We Become Ignorant? Affording 
Ignorance Through Epistemic Actions
Selene Arfini
Abstract  Which cognitive processes allow us to become ignorant of something? In 
this chapter, I will discuss “to-ignorance processes” – which I will describe as pro-
cesses that allow people to shift from a state of partial knowledge or unaware igno-
rance to another state of ignorance (of which they could be aware or not). I will 
argue that these processes affect how cognitive agents encounter new information 
and may in part explain some pressing socio-epistemological issues, such as the 
fake news problem. In the first section, I will describe some to-ignorance processes 
that commonly occur in people’s ordinary life. In the following section, I will focus 
on how people can become misinformed online by discussing what both “true” and 
“fake” news have in common, which is the fact that they present action-suggesting 
qualities to users, or affordances. The third section will be dedicated to how we 
should describe these affordances and which kinds of actions they offer to users 
online. In the fourth section, I will specifically discuss the action-based relations 
between agents and the information offered online and I will argue that some epis-
temic actions imply the explicit or implicit engagement to one’s ignorance. Finally, 
in the fifth section, I will return to the idea that to-ignorance processes affect how 
agents encounter information and I will argue that we should address and study to-­
ignorance processes to set up and manage rich environments in which people should 
have more opportunities to become curious and surprised than misinformed.

10.1  Introduction
There is a gap in the English language that is interestingly telling of our ability to 
speak about ignorance. While there are at least a few words that can describe how 
agents acquire knowledge – through learning, studying, insight, understanding – we 
do not have the same verbal capacity to describe how agents end up being ignorant. 
At best, we can say people forgot or unlearned something, so they are ignorant as 
the result of a lack of memory or lack of training, or we can say that they ignore, so 
they remain ignorant of something they do not care or want to know. But these 
words do not really describe the processes in which ignorance is the outcome: they 
are used to describe only the final state, when people already forgot or unlearned 
what they knew, or when they do not know something because they never learned 
it. The question at this point is: does this lack of terms reflect a lack of epistemologi-
cal possibility or a lack of lexicon? Are we unable to become ignorant or are we 
only limited in the way we speak about it?1
In this chapter, I will argue in favor of the second option. I will maintain that
	(a)	 There are ignorance-to-ignorance processes that affect cognitive agents’ episte-
mological processes of information encounter.
	(b)	 One can move from a state of knowledge to a state of ignorance without forget-
ting or unlearning something.
	(c)	 Some pressing epistemological issues, such as the fake news problem, could be 
fruitfully approached if we consider ignorance-to-ignorance or partial-­
knowledge-­to-ignorance processes that bring agents to become ignorant in dif-
ferent ways.
Thus, in the first section, I will begin by presenting argument (a), describing 
some to-ignorance processes that commonly occur in people’s ordinary life and 
affect how they encounter new information. I will argue that one of those processes 
should be considered not only as an ignorance-to-ignorance process but also a 
partial-­knowledge-to-ignorance one (argument (b)). This last process does not 
involve forgetting or unlearning, and it may help us understand how people can 
become misinformed. This will lead to argument (c), which will be defended in the 
rest of the chapter. By focusing on online misinformation, I will maintain that to 
explain how people can trust “fake news” and become misinformed we need to 
address the issue of how they acknowledge and engage with their ignorance in 
1 It could be useful to add a terminological note at this point. What do I mean by ignorance? Most 
authors interested in Ignorance Studies know that there are multiple definitions for ignorance now-
adays, which authors apply in different frameworks of study. In this particular context, which deals 
with both epistemological and cognitive issues, I will use a pragmatic but broad definition of 
ignorance, which accounts for its possible various uses: ignorance can be defined as a cognitive 
condition that can be either unconsciously borne by agents or actively nurtured by them, which 
entails epistemic limitations (any lack of knowledge, belief, information, or data) that affects their 
behavior, their belief system, and their inferential activity (Arfini, 2019, pp. 11–12).

ignorance-to-ignorance or partial-knowledge-to-ignorance processes (henceforth, I 
will use the term “to-ignorance” processes when in need to address both).
Thus, in the second section, I will begin discussing the problem of “fake news 
online” by approaching the issue from a different angle with respect to the current 
literature on the topic. I will indeed highlight what fake news has in common with 
true, accurate, or harmless information, instead of what makes them different. 
Indeed, I will argue that both “true” and “fake” news can be described from an eco-
logical perspective as action-suggesting qualities of objects in highly sophisticated, 
designed, and informative environments: in other words, they are peculiar affor-
dances that online communities offer to its users.
The third section will be dedicated to how we can describe these affordances. I 
will start from acknowledging that the term “affordance” has been often associated 
with designed technology: updating its meaning from the literature regarding visual 
perception from which it originated (Gibson, 1977), scholars from cognitive sci-
ence, communication theories, and technology studies have now come to use the 
concept of affordance as a way to describe the action-based relations between agents 
and the environments in which they dwell, whether it may be natural or man-made 
(Chemero, 2003; McGrenere & Ho, 2000; Nagy & Neff, 2015). Given this premise, 
discussing the affordances of true and fake news means acknowledging the action-­
based relations between agents and the information offered online. This focus will 
allow me to discuss to-ignorance processes that begin with the actions offered by 
certain affordances. In particular, by discussing the affordances of online contents, 
I will describe them as relations to both epistemic and pragmatic actions, borrowing 
the distinction provided by Kirsh and Maglio (1994). Then, I will argue that some 
epistemic actions imply the explicit or implicit engagement with one’s ignorance.
In the fourth section, I will then reflect on which kind of ignorance-engaging 
epistemic actions emerge through the consuming and distributing of online infor-
mation. By discussing the actions that allow people to become misinformed, I will 
return to the idea that to-ignorance processes affect how agents encounter informa-
tion. Thus, I will argue that we should address and study to-ignorance processes to 
set up and manage environments in which people should have more opportunities to 
become curious when facing the unexpected than misinformed.
10.2  Becoming Ignorant: Some To-Ignorance Processes
If we assume that before acquiring knowledge we are all ignorant of almost every-
thing we can know, acquiring ignorance is a theoretical impossibility. Moreover, if 
we describe ignorance as an on/off condition that affects a person’s epistemic status 
either we are “ignorant of something” (because we do not know a particular fact, or 
we mistake our mere beliefs for knowledge, or we cannot do something due to our 
lack of competence, preparation, or knowledge) or we are learning or knowing that 
something. Indeed, if we were to believe that the English language has all the words 
we need to speak about our epistemological capacity, the only epistemological

212
process we can describe is the process of learning, so a process that begins with a 
state of ignorance and ends up with knowledge.
Since we do not have specific words to describe the process of becoming igno-
rant, the realization that someone does not know what they thought they knew or the 
worsening of one’s ignorant condition become events that baffle us. Indeed, these 
events happen: In some cases, we have the impression that, while people discover, 
pay attention, or learn something, they do not only encounter new information, but 
they also increase their ignorance. Let me present some examples:
	1.	 Frank Glaw, herpetologist, in 2012, led an expedition to explore the rainforests 
of Madagascar in search of previously unknown reptile and amphibian species. 
What he found surprised him and left the scientific community baffled: the 
Brookesia nana, or nano-chameleon, is probably the smallest reptile in the world 
(Glaw et al., 2021). The puzzling features of this type of chameleon are its size 
and reversed sexual size dimorphism, since the male exemplars measure less 
than 14 millimeters and are even smaller than the females, which can measure 19 
millimeters. Frank Glaw and other scientists do not currently know how these 
chameleons ended up with these features, and they are now trying to tie them to 
evolutionary processes endemic to the Madagascar island.
	2.	 Amanda, a novelist, occasionally experiences the pains of writer’s block. She 
looks at the blank page for hours undecided regarding what will happen to her 
main character, or she starts writing and then mercilessly deletes what she has 
just put down on the paper. After a while, she does what she often ends up doing 
after a block: she opens a new jigsaw puzzle, and she will not resume writing 
until she finishes it. It usually works in curing writer’s block. Today, as usual, she 
finishes the puzzle, and she seems to have new ideas regarding how the story will 
develop. But there is something else: She also realizes that she does not know 
why this trick works. Is it because the jigsaw puzzle mimicries the work she 
needs to do while assembling a story? Is it because she does the puzzle alone and 
in silence? Would her trick work if she was with other people or if she did it 
while listening to music? With all these questions in mind, she decides to search 
on the internet to see if someone has already answered these questions in current 
psychological papers.
	3.	 Beatrice has a very basic knowledge of how vaccines work: she is not a medical 
expert, but she has been vaccinated when she was young, listened to some brief 
lectures on vaccines during biology class in school, and never questioned the 
impact of those vaccinations in her life. She has now a son, and she needs to 
decide whether he will receive new and old types of vaccinations. She spends 
some time discussing her indecision with a few other mothers who declare to be 
concerned with the impact of too many vaccinations on babies. They introduce 
Beatrice to some theories that highlight the (unproven or scientifically debunked) 
dangers of vaccines. After a while, she ends up believing – mistakenly – that vac-
cines cause autism and decides not to vaccinate her children.
Unarguably, these cases do not represent the usual examples presented in the philo-
sophical literature to illustrate ignorant states. In none of these situations, describing 
S. Arfini

213
the state of the agent as “S is ignorant of p” would encompass the complexity of 
their epistemic status. Indeed, starting from Frank and Amanda’s cases, we can say 
that, while they end up with questions and new unknowns, they also engage with 
new kinds of knowledge and true beliefs (in Amanda’s case, e.g., she becomes 
aware of her ignorance). The to-ignorance processes they engage with are con-
nected to two concepts already studied in the philosophical literature and common-
sensically associated with ignorance, even if they are not currently discussed in 
Ignorance Studies: unexpected encounters that lead agents to become surprised and 
curious.2
Indeed, Frank Glaw’s expedition has led to a “surprising” and “puzzling” discov-
ery: while the research team was looking for new species, they did not expect to find 
the smallest reptile on the planet (Andrew, 2021) and they still do not know how a 
chameleon could have been evolved to be of that size. This discovery (and knowl-
edge advancement) has opened a great number of questions. New hypotheses 
regarding size requirements for reptiles’ sexual reproduction and Madagascar’s 
peculiar evolutionary processes have been advanced to provide explanations for the 
existence of the Brookesia nana. These puzzling questions, for now, lead only to 
other hypotheses and queries – so potential knowledge but also the acknowledge-
ment of new and specific ignorance.
Amanda, instead, did not begin her to-ignorance process with a discovery. She 
becomes curious and wants to understand how something she mindlessly does 
affects her writing process. While she has a few hypotheses regarding how it works, 
she is using them to shape focused questions (so to target specific unknowns), 
instead of taking them as ground for nonscientific answers. She is willing to remain 
in a state of uncertainty to see if someone else, who is maybe an expert in writer’s 
block or writing processes, can give her some more stable answers.
So, we can see that “being surprised by” and “becoming curious about” some-
thing are already processes that the English language allows us to describe  to-­
ignorance processes, since they lead agents from partial knowledge or ignorance to 
other complex states composed by not only potential knowledge, but also newly 
acknowledged ignorance.3 Looking at these processes from a point of view focused 
2 I need to point out that Firestein (2012) already tied the concept of ignorance to scientific advance-
ment, but the current Ignorance Studies have not productively engaged with this thread of enquiry. 
In this volume, however, we have three contributions that provide new discussions on the role of 
ignorance in curiosity and creativity (Ross’ chapter), wonder (Glaveanu’s one), and the acknowl-
edgment of one’s ignorance (Sans Pinillos and Magnani’s one).
3 I need to thank Wendy Ross for an insightful comment regarding a difference between surprise 
and curiosity that I should mention at this point. While both curiosity and surprise emerge as a 
reaction to a state of ignorance, people who become curious preserves that state in order to find out 
answers, while people who are surprised have, at least in part, already resolved the state of igno-
rance. In Frank Glaw’s state, the unexpected discovery of Brookesia nana made him realize that he 
was ignorant of the existence of the smallest reptile on the planet. At the same time, while he still 
does not know how that reptile came to be of that size, he now knows that it exists. Surprise is then 
a state of awareness regarding a previous ignorant condition, which is at least in part resolved by 
the knowledge acquired when the agent becomes surprised.
10  How Do We Become Ignorant? Affording Ignorance Through Epistemic Actions

214
on ignorance, we can say that through surprise and curiosity, we do not simply take 
“known unknowns” (using the now established Rumsfield’s lexicon  – (Logan, 
2009)) as the starting point of a problem-solving process, but they are also the result 
of an ignorance-engagement that starts from potential or partial knowledge.
Beatrice’s case instead represents a dramatically different example. If Beatrice at 
first knew something about vaccinations, then she became both curious and suspi-
cious about an aspect of it (which is tied to new vaccinations) she didn’t consider or 
know about before. So, she got the chance to gather new knowledge on it, but also 
of becoming misinformed about it. By gathering what she mistakenly thought was 
grounded knowledge, she accumulated ignorance in the form of false beliefs, mis-
understood concepts, and inaccurate representations. She basically went from a 
state of partial knowledge to a state of unaware ignorance by undergoing a process 
in which she engaged with the ignorance she was aware of (she was indeed aware 
of her partial ignorance regarding vaccines). In a similar way also Amanda and 
Frank engaged with their ignorance. Thus, why and how two cases had positive 
outcomes, such as scientific research, surprise, and curiosity, and one ended up with 
misinformation and unaware ignorance?
As already stated, these examples have been deliberately chosen to represent 
widely different cases of to-ignorance processes. Indeed, in all these situations, the 
main characters perform and experience epistemological processes that heavily 
involve ignorance, even if not in the usual arc that starts from ignorance and ends 
with knowledge. Instead, Frank and Amanda start from a type of ignorance – which 
we can call “unknown unknown” and end up with another type of ignorance, of 
which they are aware – so “known unknown.”4 Beatrice instead became, in a way, 
more ignorant than before, or she worsened her ignorant condition by engaging with 
what she was not knowledgeable about. She started from a state of imperfect but 
grounded knowledge and a state in which she knew what she was ignorant about 
(known unknown) and reached a state of unaware ignorance (unknown unknown). 
Thus, understanding what differentiates the processes that led Beatrice to this state 
from the processes that led Frank and Amanda to their research is the main goal of 
this chapter.
4 Admittedly, using a broad definition for knowledge, I should say that “known unknown” could 
also represent a partial type of knowledge. However, we usually resist the attribution of knowl-
edge, even partial knowledge, in cases that involve both agents’ ignorance and partial knowledge – 
as when we acknowledge, for example, known unknowns. Still, in the same cases, we have no 
problem in recognizing how the agent’s beliefs system, reasoning, and behavior are affected by 
ignorance. One explanation for this tendency is that we use a double standard for ignorance and 
knowledge. Indeed, we hold a higher standard for the attribution of knowledge rather than igno-
rance, and so, we tend to distinguish, for example, knowledge from mere belief, while we use a 
broad meaning for ignorance to generally speak of lack of knowledge, but also lack of awareness, 
comprehension, or confidence. This lower standard for the attribution of ignorance explains why 
definitions of ignorance as lack of knowledge (Le Morvan, 2013) or lack of true beliefs (Pierre Le 
Morvan & Peels 2016) are now broadly challenged in Ignorance Studies. Indeed, they seem to defy 
the common use of ignorance as a broader term, which refers to a combination of epistemic lack 
(lack of information, knowledge, competence, etc.) and specific attitudes of self-awareness (doubt, 
uncertainty, unawareness, etc.).
S. Arfini

215
This aim brings us to look in a new way the ideas of disinformation, misinforma-
tion, and malinformation. These terms now describe different ways in which false, 
deceiving, inaccurate, or harmful contents are believed and shared by various agents 
in informative environments (Greifeneder et al., 2020a, b), and they basically com-
pose the so-called “fake news” problem. At least since 2016, scholars from different 
disciplinary backgrounds have suggested ways to make users able to separate true, 
accurate, genuine news and fake ones (O’Connor & Weatherall, 2019) and to pro-
vide reasons for the easy diffusion of fake news in online media (Alessandro Bessi 
et al., 2016). Here, I propose a new approach to discuss the distribution of fake news 
on online platforms, which is not based on their different qualities with respect to 
true, accurate, or harmless information but on their shared cognitive traits. I will 
argue that their shared cognitive traits related to how they offer agents the possibil-
ity to engage in to-ignorance processes, by surprising them, arousing their curiosity, 
and so letting them become informed or misinformed.
With the aim of considering specific occurrences of this processes, in the rest of 
the chapter, I will focus on how both true and fake news are shared in informative 
environments, specifically online communities, and how they both offer users the 
possibility to engage in to-ignorance processes.
10.3  Fake News Online
Before considering to-ignorance processes that happen in online environments, I 
shall first justify why I think is important for our purposes to discuss the cognitive 
processes involved in the diffusion of both fake news and accurate, harmless, or 
verified information online. To defend this perspective, I shall quickly present some 
recurrent issues that affect the academic debates on fake news online.
First of all, despite the efforts of scholars from different disciplinary backgrounds 
and social media experts who have repeatedly provided information on fake news 
online to the general population (Forgas & Baumeister, 2019; Greifeneder et al., 
2020a, b; O’Connor & Weatherall, 2019), users seem to still consume fake news 
without acknowledging or recognizing their falsity, inaccuracy, or more generally 
“wrongness” (Bessi et al., 2014). Moreover, there is still not a consensus on what 
the phenomenon of fake news really entails or how can we properly define fake 
news. Indeed, for any give rule that scholars tie to this concept there are cases left 
out and exceptions.
For example, it’s easy to find various definitions that rely on the epistemic faults 
of fake news (Ackland & Gwynn, 2020; Jaffé & Greifeneder, 2020; Rini, 2017). 
However, many scholars (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017; Gelfert, 2018; Jaster & Lanius, 
2018; Piazza & Croce, 2019) recognize that fake news is not always simply false 
news. Indeed, a part of the fake news lexicon is the phenomenon of malinformation 
(Greifeneder et al., 2020a, b), which counts as spreading factually correct informa-
tion with harmful implications – for example, leaking factually true private informa-
tion that should not be publicly known. Moreover, there are different kinds of “false”

stories online – as satirical contents, fiction, and uninformed opinions – that are not 
meant to be harmful, nor deceitful (Golbeck et al., 2018; Low et al., 2022; Molina 
et al., 2021; Sinclair, 2020).
Alternatively, some scholars highlight the “intentional” character of fake news, 
describing it as deliberately deceptive, assuming that it often incorporates lies or 
bullshit (according to Frankfurt’s definition (2009, 10), i.e., “lack of connection to a 
concern with truth”). One of the problems of this description is that it leaves out 
misinformation, which is like a misunderstanding, since it is false or inaccurate but 
not intended to harm (Greifeneder et al., 2020a, b). At the same time, a definition of 
fake news which is focused on its intentional character seems also to include epis-
temically harmless concepts, such as jokes and satire, which are connotated by the 
intention to deceive, at least temporarily, their audience (Rubin et al., 2016).
This difficulty in finding a clear, comprehensive, and accurate way to describe 
fake news is the reason why, even when scholars put together various features of 
fake news (as its epistemic, sociological, intentional, or political character – Piazza 
and Croce (2019)), they need to specify that that definition only applies to a particu-
lar type of fake news and not in general.
Another issue linked to the ontological instability of fake news and its difficult 
detection is its emerging “political” characterization. According to different schol-
ars (Coady, 2019; Habgood-Coote, 2019), the expression “fake news” is at this 
point used and abused to “illegitimately marginalize and pathologize the views of 
people they [politicians, communicators, and journalists] disagree with” (Coady, 
2019, 41). Thus, while we struggle to comprehend a phenomenon of which we are 
sure to know certain examples, the problem of how to distinguish the dangerous 
from the harmless remains, and, according to these authors, we need to ask our-
selves if it is worth to bet our freedom of speech on the idea that maybe now, or 
maybe one day, we will find the right definition for fake news.
Thus, while searching for ways to distinguish fake news from the rest may still 
be a worthy endeavor, it could be rather more fruitful to increase our understanding 
regarding what fake and accurate news have in common. Especially if we consider 
that when users are online, unless they have specific reasons to do so, they do not 
actually care about fake news (Croce & Piazza, forthcoming; Greifeneder et al., 
2020a, b). They use online communities to be entertained, to see others’ opinions 
and arguments, to satiate their “hunger for social recognition” as Croce and Piazza 
(forthcoming) call it, looking for engaging stories, tips, and practical or political 
advice. So, if users do not actively try to separate between fake news and the rest, it 
must be also because what these two categories do have in common makes users 
read the content, click on it, and share it, no matter the veracity of the online 
information.
So, looking at the practical character of online information, in the next section I 
will examine the kinds of actions that are offered in these online frameworks by 
relying on the concept of affordance. Then, I will present possible reasons why 
people may end up more informed or misinformed by engaging with the affor-
dances offered by online content.

10.4  To-Ignorance Affordances
Many controversies surround the term “affordance” in both philosophical and psy-
chological literature. Some of the controversies relate to the different goals of the 
authors who used and shaped the meaning of this term (Gibson, 1977; Magnani & 
Bardone, 2008; Norman, 1988); others rest on the possibility of using the word 
when referring to cultural objects (McGrenere & Ho, 2000; Michaels, 2003; Oliver, 
2005); and many others yet rely on the fact that some authors now consider the 
concept too vague to provide any kind of clarity to psychological or philosophical 
discourses (Heras-Escribano & de Pinedo, 2016; Jones, 2003; Oliver, 2005). Thus, 
in this section, I will first need to address some of these issues to be able to move to 
discuss the relevance of the concept of affordance in relation to to-ignorance actions 
spurred by online information. Doing so, I will show how these controversies do not 
primarily arise from deep disagreements around the applicability of the term, but 
from the impelling necessity to consider the value of perceiving objects for actions 
in cognitive research.
10.4.1  A Brief History of Affordances: From Gibson to Costa
A good way to begin discussing the relevance of the concept of affordance for the 
current investigation would be to define the term’s coinage and historical develop-
ment. Indeed, it is now well known that the first usage of the terms comes from 
James Gibson’s studies on visual perception. The usual presentation of this coinage 
focuses on the first controversy that the term spurred: Gibson presented affordances 
as something that “the environment offers to the animal, what it provides or fur-
nishes, either for good or ill” (p. 127), so describing the environment as something 
that has an “active” role in perception. However, “affordance,” in the Gibsonian 
theory, is also a word that defies a strict dichotomy between “active and passive,” 
“subjective and objective,” “mental and physical,” and “real and phenomenal” (p. 41 
and p. 129) since it relies both on the environment and on the perception of the 
agents. However, above these traits that make the description of affordance 
extremely abstract, the two Gibsonian features of the term that made it a crucial 
notion in ecological psychology are its dependance on direct perception (which is 
not mediated by conceptual efforts) and the relation to action. So, an affordance 
emerges from the relation between the agents and objects as a possibility for action, 
which is not connected to cultural and intellectual efforts of the subjects.
While perceiving objects as calls for action has moved forward the research in 
ecological psychology, Gibson’s resistance in talking about affordances outside of 
situations in which our perception is affected by cultural beliefs and skills has 
brought forth numerous criticisms. The idea that affordances do not depend on any 
cultural ground appears a limitation that arbitrarily restricts the field of application 
of ecological psychology and seems to be inconsistent with some position Gibson

218
took regarding learning and developing affordance-based skills. As Oliver (2005, 
404) notes:
It is interesting to consider the kinds of claims Gibson makes for affordances. Most are 
animalistic or primitive (Gibson, 1971); technology, if mentioned, is stone-age (e.g. clubs, 
hand axes, spears, awls [Gibson, 1979, p. 40; cf. p. 128])[…] Gibson does attempt to extend 
this theory to more complex affordances – but the examples are sparse and unconvincing 
(e.g. 1979, p.  42), resorting to what can only be interpreted as visual stereotypes (e.g. 
‘Mates, and amiable animals are distinguished from … hostile animals by their shapes, 
colors, textures, and deformations’ [1979, p. 232]). […] Indeed, in spite of his attempts to 
argue the irrelevance of the mind, Gibson repeatedly states that affordances need learning 
(e.g. 1979, pp. 143, 194, 235; Gibson, 1971). Even for the most ‘basic’ affordances, he 
concedes that perception might need to develop in some way – something that most people 
would call a kind of learning even if Gibson avoids describing it as such (Gibson, 1979, 
pp. 168, 241, 253).
So, Gibson does not explain how the process of perceptual development and selec-
tion works and discounts the intentionality of selection, which was instead recog-
nized by following researchers (Gregory, 1998) as knowledge-informed. Moreover, 
he implied that affordances are relational without specifying which kind of relation-
ship is established and between which elements of the ecological framework.5
Thus, it was in partial contrast to Gibson’s situated but anti-mentalist conception 
that Donald Norman (1988, 1999) proposed a second crucial definition of affor-
dance, by grounding it on the framework of technological design. He explored the 
concept by highlighting the role of the user who recognizes affordances using 
“mental interpretations of things,” which, in turn are expressed through the agents’ 
use of objects. While this second definition provided new ways to apply the concept 
beyond the animalistic context established by Gibson, it also was heavily criticized 
for its ontological assumptions. Norman, indeed, discussed the hypothesis that 
“there can be both real and perceived affordances, and the two sets need not be the 
same” (Norman, 1999, 24). He claimed that our possibilities only concern the latter, 
while the former shape both known and unexplored opportunities. Unfortunately, 
this difference between the two concepts remains unclear to this day.
In the end, current literature on affordances seems to have tinkered with these 
definitions and move on without solving their issues. For example, Chemero (2003) 
argues that we need to consider affordances, grounded by the Gibsonian theory, as 
action relations that emerge when a specific agent interacts with a specific environ-
ment. In a sense, they are relations between certain aspects of agents and particular 
aspects of situations that emerge when the agent interacts with the environment and 
finds out ways to act. In a similar manner, and especially in social media studies, the 
concept of affordance is used either to address the action-relation between users and 
features of environments or they more specifically reflect Gibsonian or Normanian 
5 Chemero (2003) highlights how the imprecise relationships that the Gibsonian theory of affor-
dances establishes leave various pressing questions unexplored and unresolved. For example: do 
affordances emerge as relations between the agent as a whole and the environment as embedding 
context, or between a feature of the agent and a feature of the world, or a mix of both categories?

descriptions, in both cases belittling the caveats of the theories that originated and 
developed the term.
The interesting point of this ongoing progress of the literature on affordances is 
not that there are now more disagreements than agreed-upon solutions regarding the 
action-based relationship between agents and their environments, but the shared 
belief that there is a persistent necessity of addressing this topic to understand 
agents’ perception and decision-making. Indeed, one way to proceed with the inves-
tigation that almost all scholars interested in affordances now adopt is to individuate 
an explanatory gap in the literature and, while bridging it, acknowledging the expan-
sion of the meaning of affordances (Magnani, 2009; Magnani & Bardone, 2008). 
One notable example is the investigation brought forth by Elisabetta Costa (2018), 
who noted that most of the affordance-based discussions on online media overlook 
the role of the users to focus on the structure and designed opportunities given by 
the online platforms (Boyd, 2010; Papacharissi & Yuan, 2011; Trepte, 2015; Vitak 
& Kim, 2014). To bridge this gap, she resolves to use what she renamed “affordances-­
in-­practice” to highlight the capacity of users to exploit uses for technologies that 
pertain to their sociocultural context.
Proceeding this way with adjustments and additions, a theory of affordance can 
enrich the discussion around online information by addressing the pressing issue of 
what users do when they interact with digital objects. For example, affordances can 
be used to discuss how users do not only produce or consume data, but they effec-
tively become what Bruns et al. (2012) call “produsers”, an hybridization of the two 
roles. Indeed, as produsers, agents’ interaction with digital environments depends 
not only on what they merely read, see, and hear but also on what they do with 
online information within and outside of digital environments.
Moreover, using affordances as perception-action relations to understand what 
online content provides is also in tune with recent literacy studies (Lee, 2007, 227), 
which argue that reading and writing are not “decoding” letters and words, but 
human activities in context, literacy events and practices that cannot be arbitrarily 
distinct from other human activities. It also supports some theories that heavily 
influence current cognitive science. For example, Andy Clark (2005, 2006) insisted 
on the necessity to focus on the materiality of language and how that materiality 
influences our cognitive efforts and activities.
From sounds in the air, to inscriptions on the printed page, the material structures of lan-
guage both reflect, and then systematically transform, our thinking and reasoning about the 
world. […] Linguistic forms and structures are first encountered as simply objects in our 
world. But they then form a potent overlay that effectively, and iteratively, reconfigures the 
space for biological reason and self-control! (Clark, 2005, 265)
Furthermore, the affordances of written language have already been amply investi-
gated in psychological empirical studies, for example, to analyze the impact of digi-
tal technologies on learning (Fortunati & Vincent, 2014; Haines, 2015; Taipale, 
2014), and to determine the different experiences of reading print books or e-books 
(D’Ambra et al., 2016; Krunic et al., 2009; Lee, 2007).
10  How Do We Become Ignorant? Affording Ignorance Through Epistemic Actions

220
Thus, it is not so controversial to say that discussing which kind of affordances 
emerge in our interaction with online content is fundamental to know what we actu-
ally do with the information we find online. Indeed, my intention in this chapter is 
not to understand how users generally interact with some features of the digital 
environment or with technological design, but to investigate users’ interaction with 
online contents and information. For this reason, I will not base my argument on 
taxonomies of online affordances that focus on designed opportunities offered by 
the platforms (as the ones provided by Boyd (2010), Nagy and Neff (2015), Moreno 
(2019)), but I will borrow a taxonomy of online affordances that explicitly focus on 
how users interact with online content. To this end, the distinction offered by 
O’Riordan et al. (2012) between social- and content-based affordances, which I will 
comment in the next subsection, will provide a great start. Then, I will maintain that 
we could even get in more details regarding the specific actions available to users of 
online environments by using the definition provided by Kirsh and Maglio (1994) 
of epistemic and pragmatic actions.
10.4.2  Affording Pragmatic or Epistemic Actions
As briefly introduced in the previous subsection, O’Riordan et al. (2012) provide a 
useful distinction between two kinds of social networking sites affordances: social- 
and content-based ones. According to the authors, social affordances are grounded 
on users’ connectivity, interactivity, and profile management: they depend on how 
users present themselves to others, perceive others, and can interact with one 
another. Content-based affordances pertain instead to content discovery, sharing 
and aggregation: Basically, they describe how users come across pieces of informa-
tion while online and what they can do within the online environment with those 
data. Of course, they recognize that content-based affordances are directly enabled 
by social affordances: indeed, they specify that “without social connectivity, inter-
activity, and profile management, users would not be able to discover, share and 
aggregate information” (p. 187). This dependence of content-based affordances to 
social ones comes from the goals and aims of social media users: If social connec-
tion and entertainment is the goal of online activities, then finding information is 
just their by-product. So, O’Riordan et al. (2012)’s study favors the view already 
offered by my colleagues and me (Arfini et al., 2019; Arfini & Bertolotti, 2018) as 
well as other authors (Croce & Piazza, forthcoming), which describe the informa-
tion encountering on social media as strictly dependent on social aims, rules, and 
structures. Thus, it is important to see the social framework that shapes how agents 
encounter online content to further discuss which actions that content affords them.
In particular, I here argue that engagement with online content may afford users 
two types of actions, which were presented by Kirsch and Maglio (1994): pragmatic 
and epistemic ones. The authors introduced the term “epistemic action” to designate 
actions which human agents take to alter their physical environment with the intent 
S. Arfini

221
of gathering and evaluating information and facilitating cognition. Epistemic actions 
may lead to uncover information that is hidden, reduce the memory required, the 
number of steps, or the probability of error in mental computation. Epistemic 
actions thus change the informational state of the actor as well as the physical state 
of the environment. Kirsh and Maglio contrasted epistemic actions with “pragmatic 
actions,” which instead are taken to implement a plan or a reaction, or in some other 
way move oneself closer to a pragmatic goal.
Epistemic actions are very much common in our daily life: looking for more 
information, asking others and experts, arguing with someone, affirming something, 
thinking out loud, and even following some advice can be seen as epistemic actions. 
Therefore, when dealing with actions taken on social media, any of those endeavors 
should be described not only as a modification of the digital environments, but also 
as a way to change the epistemic status of the users. Moreover, it must be acknowl-
edged that an epistemic action may start on the web and then continue offline or 
imply a following pragmatic action within or outside the digital environment.
Now, the idea behind the distinction between epistemic and pragmatic actions 
relies on a strong meaning of people’s intention: the definition of epistemic action 
relies on the fact that we sometimes do things with the implicit or explicit goal of 
testing, evaluating, or changing our beliefs, epistemic skills, or epistemic status not 
because we want to necessarily change something in the world. At the same time, 
the definition of epistemic and pragmatic actions also does not acknowledge the fact 
that not always users are able to achieve the goals they set for themselves. While the 
fallibility of users in doing a pragmatic action is not difficult to spot as a complica-
tion in their endeavors, if we reflect upon the users’ possibility of failings while they 
are doing an epistemic action, we may realize that the issue of self-awareness of 
their fallibility may arise. Indeed, while users may feel confident that some actions 
have led them to gain new, useful, and reliable information, or found a solution to 
reduce the number of steps involved in problem-solving activities, they also may 
have not achieved the results they were hoping for. At the same time, the fact that 
agents feel more confident in their knowledge, which may or may not translate into 
an actual knowing epistemic status, does not change the fact that they have employed 
epistemic actions to get there.
Of course, some epistemic actions may also lead users to acknowledge their 
epistemic status and confront their ignorance as something that they can overcome. 
Thus, this realization demands to look closely at which kind of epistemic actions are 
afforded on online communities and how they help agents engage or acknowledge 
their ignorance-based status. If epistemic actions offered online do not involve ways 
to make users aware of their ignorance, they may be the reason why to-ignorance 
processes, as the ones that make users misinformed, frequently happen in online 
communities.
Thus, in the next section, I will discuss which kinds of online content affords 
users epistemic actions, and which kinds of epistemic actions emerge from the 
encounters of this content.
10  How Do We Become Ignorant? Affording Ignorance Through Epistemic Actions

222
10.5  To-Ignorance Actions Online
The American pragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (1998) described the 
phenomenological experience of ignorance, or doubt, as an irritating state. Thus, the 
concept of doubt in this perspective refers to a partial awareness of the subjects 
regarding what they do not know: indeed, if agents realize that they do not know 
something and it is implied that they should know it – so they have Peircean doubts – 
an itch emerges, and the relief is only provided by a gain in perceived knowledge or 
information that they believe is true and verified.
This pragmatist reflection appears repeatedly in recent treatises in cognitive epis-
temology (Arfini & Bertolotti, 2019; Hookway, 1998, 2008; Oreskes, 2015; Woods, 
2005), when it is important to highlight how agents may be completely unaware of 
the difference between their knowledge and their mere beliefs. In this context, it 
could be valuable to understand to which kind of ends the epistemic actions online 
may lead the agents and why to-ignorance processes are enacted, so explaining why 
users keep find and trust online information notwithstanding they know about the 
broad diffusion of fake news in digital environments.
Indeed, it’s radically important to discuss with which theory of mind we approach 
the topic of online content sharing. When discussing the fake news problem, we 
intuitively imply that when users discover, share, or aggregate on their pages some 
contents, this action must imply some kinds of epistemic state and the term “belief” 
or “acceptance” is usually used to peak into the users’ mind. However, when we 
interact with online content shared by people online or aggregated on their page, we 
can, most of the times, recognize tone, irony, and sarcasm, and so, we look at the 
description provided by the users to understand how much they actually believe 
what they share. Thus, we do not take for granted that people always believe or trust 
what they share online. Moreover, as produsers, when users share something on 
social media, of course, they do not share just what they think is true or fake news 
(because they can also share a content because they present it as fake news), but they 
share those contents that convince them, entertain them, or make them connect with 
certain people. So, some content is explicitly shared to provide means of social 
interaction that, as a by-product, also affords epistemic actions to users.
To make an easy example, I could refer to a clickbait headline: it is usually “dis-
tinguished by their sensational, exaggerated, or deliberately false headlines that 
grab attention and deceive the user into clicking an article with questionable con-
tent” (Karadzhov et al., 2017, 334). According to various authors (Blom & Hansen, 
2015; Karadzhov et al., 2017; Zannettou et al., 2018), it often employs a forward 
reference rhetoric, which “induce anticipation and curiosity so the readers click (or 
tap on) the headline and read on” (Blom & Hansen, 2015, 87). So, in few simple 
lines of text, a clickbait headline makes the users curious about something – which 
is, as we know, another way to say that it makes them aware of their ignorance – and 
it offers a simple way to satiate their curiosity: clicking on that news. Thus, those 
few lines of text afford an epistemic action, clicking on it, which will lead the users 
to know more about something about which they were previously not aware they 
were ignorant.
S. Arfini

223
Therefore, both the awareness of users’ ignorance and the epistemic action aimed 
at reducing it emerge from reading the clickbait headline. More than that: the epis-
temic action is afforded because agents become aware of their ignorance, so 
because they enacted a to-ignorance process. The same mechanism can even in part 
explain the appeal and diffusion of conspiracy theories on online media. Indeed, in 
conspiracy theory websites, it is common to read headlines that say “this informa-
tion has been kept from you,” which suggests that there is something readers think 
they know while they do not, and invite them to click on the news to know “what 
they were lied about” (Alessandro Bessi et al., 2015; Forgas & Baumeister, 2019; 
Sunstein & Vermeule, 2009). Thus, they lure the curious and lead them to some 
unexpected answers to questions they were not asking. So, conspiracy theories 
headlines rely on a particular ignorance-awareness that affords specific epistemic 
action to be mitigated.
In other cases, even reading the sole headline guarantees both the emergence of 
the ignorance awareness state and the ignorance-mitigating action. This dependence 
on to-ignorance processes of online affordances could indeed explain why various 
studies confirm that sharing news without opening the link is a common action on 
online media (indeed, Gabielkov et al. (2016) report that 59% of the news items on 
Twitter in the previous year were shared without having been opened). The often 
invoked “laziness” of users could be more charitably explained by relying on to-­
ignorance process and affordance of epistemic and pragmatic actions. After all, why 
should people waste their time if, by only reading the title of the article, they are 
able to both have their curiosity aroused and satiated? The only further action avail-
able to them at this point would be practical or social: for example, they could share 
the news and offer others the same chance to get curious and end this state by the 
time they finish reading the headline. Thus, in these cases, the epistemic action is 
not the only nor the main one offered by the news. Indeed, online information vari-
ously provides courses of actions (in this framework, pragmatic actions) within and 
outside of the online platform.
I indeed already commented on the amply supported idea that content-based 
affordances – or users’ content-based actions and goals – rely on social ones. This 
means that content-based affordances also rely on and afford social pragmatic 
actions within the network. Schwarz and Jalbert (2021) indeed report that prescrip-
tive and socially invested messages – for example, “share something,” “vote some-
thing,” “do something” – remain even longer in users’ memory than the information 
on which they are based upon. Moreover, if the information upon which the pre-
scriptive message is based is negative, then it also leads to users’ more attention and 
activation, which also lead to easier retrieval and generation of evidence (Jaffé & 
Greifeneder, 2020). That’s a reason why political communication is felt more effec-
tively when the “normatively relevant claims,” as Rini (2017) calls them, are made 
together with bad news (p. 120). Suddenly, in these cases, not only the suggested 
pragmatic action is something that grabs attention, but it’s also felt urgent, impor-
tant, necessary, since the situation is not ideal. Jaffé and Greifeneder (2020) call it a 
framing effect, which allows the delivery of a pragmatic suggestion to be more 
efficient. Of course, these implications are most problematic if the suggested course 
10  How Do We Become Ignorant? Affording Ignorance Through Epistemic Actions

224
of action is based upon false or inaccurate information. In a recent article, psycholo-
gists Daphna Oyserman and Andrew Dawson (2020) even use the distinction 
between information and disinformation describing the latter “news that suggests 
courses of actions,” irrespective of the veracity of what is shared. “In contrast,” they 
say “information is content shared to inform message recipients, and what is shared 
is assumed to be true” (Oyserman & Dawson, 2020, 174).
Looking at the other side of the coin, the importance of prescriptive messages in 
online content seems also to explain why fact-checking is not always effective, can 
backfire, and ultimately does not change the political or policy-based opinion of 
those who were already subjected to false information online (Cook et al., 2015; 
Porter et al., 2019). Indeed, fact-checking does not need to contain practical sugges-
tions to go against the prescriptive messages incorporated in the fake news it aims 
at correcting. Basically, if a fake news says, “vote politician X, because the policies 
presented by politician Y will ban cars,” the fact-checking news regarding the actual 
policies of politician Y does not imply that readers should vote for politician Y. Since 
most fact-checking news only focus on correcting the descriptive information at the 
expense of the message’s pragmatic impact (Schwarz & Jalbert, 2021), they are less 
effective than the descriptive-prescriptive message of the fake news that they aim at 
correcting. If people already accepted and put in their backburner a pragmatic action 
that responded to a problem, the reframing of the pragmatic problem without the 
acknowledgement of the pragmatic action will not be as convincing.
For this reason, in a recent psychological study, Newman and Zhang (2020) pro-
posed to discuss not the idea that fake news provides false information, but they 
discuss the misleading side of the context in which information is presented. 
According to them, the word misleading encompasses better the dangerous dynam-
ics that surrounds the phenomenon that it is deemed problematic on social media. 
Misleading and fake are not the same thing: misleading content regards action. Fake 
news implies merely make-belief effects. So, by focusing on the calls for actions 
toward users of social media, we could get more answers regarding how online 
information works (van der Linden, 2017).
Thus, as my final argument, I’ll say that instead of looking for ways to reduce the 
number or the appeal of fake news online, we should learn to let to-ignorance pro-
cesses emerge and afford better epistemic actions when diffusing accurate and reli-
able information.
10.6  Which Epistemic Actions Should We Promote Online?
Most of the examples used in the fourth section came from studies on fake news, 
disinformation, and misinformation. However, not just fake news leads to the emer-
gence of to-ignorance processes and to the affordance of epistemic and pragmatic 
actions to users. Breaking news, strange personal stories, or scientific

communication online all conform to that format, in the way that they aim at mak-
ing ignorance emerge and they offer epistemic actions to mitigate it. So, why is the 
diffusion of fake news so alarming? Why accurate and true news do not spread so 
easily on social media?
As maintained in Sect. 10.3, fake news is difficult to describe, to spot by all the 
people who engage with it, and all over the place. Moreover, it is an almost inevi-
table drawback of the emergence of new informational media (Coady, 2019) and it 
will resist attempts to reduce it that do not convey terrible harm to our freedom of 
speech. To all this, I also need to add that to perform fact-checking online, like when 
committing a murder, users need to have means, motive, and opportunity, which do 
not happen to be always available when online browsing. Indeed, “retweeting with-
out thinking” (Schwarz & Jalbert, 2021) is not so different from what we do in 
everyday life, when we generally start from the assumption that the other speakers 
are cooperative agents whose contributions are truthful, informative, and clear 
(unless we have previously assumed reasons for doubting them). So, if the aim of 
reducing fake news is at best difficult to achieve, I think we should focus on more 
productive ways to improve our engagement with online contents.
Fake news commonly exploits social memory (Schwarz & Jalbert, 2021), emo-
tional engagement, and fluency effects (Gilbert, 1991): since we cannot change 
what human agents more easily see and retain in memory, we can exploit what we 
know to make reliable information catch the attention of users as much as fake news 
does by using the same rhetorical tricks. Since online media users are not passive 
victims of fake news but actual producers of various informational contents they 
stumble upon online, social media scholars could propose ways to support the dif-
fusion of reliable information with all the methods now fake news spreads. If we 
give more importance to the relationship between online contents and the afforded 
epistemic and pragmatic actions, we could allow social media users to consume 
effortlessly more reliable news than bad ones. For example, as already affirmed, the 
relation between ignorance-emergence states and ignorance-mitigating epistemic 
actions is already exploited to diffuse breaking news, strange personal stories, and 
scientific communication. Indeed, instead of looking for ways to reduce the number 
or the appeal of fake news online, we should learn to use and exploit the same 
mechanisms of ignorance-emergence and mitigation with epistemic and pragmatic 
action for better diffusing real and reliable news.
When scientific communications and breaking news are efficacious, they suggest 
pragmatical advice, the name of experts and specialists to follow, and debunk both 
fake news on the topic and name the counter-pragmatic-actions that people should 
follow instead. These pragmatical sides of news sharing could become even more 
spread if social media study starts investing in them to counter fake news diffusion. 
For these reasons, it is also necessary to continue the research on which kind of 
perceived ignorance-based affordances are offered by online content. After all, the 
more we know, the more we can share, also online.
10  How Do We Become Ignorant? Affording Ignorance Through Epistemic Actions

226
10.7  Conclusions
Beatrice’s example (Sect. 10.2) as a to-ignorance process is not representative of all 
ways in which people can become misinformed. However, discussing misinforma-
tion as a reaction to a state of ignorance that could have developed in curiosity and 
research could provide us new ways to describe and approach different socio-­
epistemological issues as the fake news problem. In this chapter, I argued that if, 
indeed, there is a gap in the English language regarding our ability to speak about 
ignorance as part of ongoing cognitive processes, bridging that gap should be a 
priority for the goals of current social epistemology research.
To prove this necessity, I presented the hypothesis that some to-ignorance pro-
cesses commonly occur in our ordinary life and affect how we encounter new infor-
mation. I then focused on online misinformation, maintaining that to explain how 
people can trust “fake news” and become misinformed we need to address the issue 
of how they acknowledge and engage with their ignorance in to-ignorance pro-
cesses. I argued that both “true” and “fake” news can be described from an ecologi-
cal perspective as objects that afford users specific epistemic and pragmatic actions. 
By discussing in depth those actions, I reflected on which kind of ignorance-­
engaging epistemic actions emerge through the consuming and distributing of 
online information and I returned to the idea that to-ignorance processes affect how 
agents encounter information. Thus, I argued that we should address and study to-­
ignorance processes to set up and manage environments – like online communi-
ties  – to offer people more opportunities to become curious and surprised than 
misinformed.
