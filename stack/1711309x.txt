This thesis has been an important part of my daily activities during more than six years.
The thought “I should be working on my thesis” has constantly accompanied me during both
working and spare time. Too frequently, the thesis has absorbed me, stealing time from my
other activities, my family and friends. It is diﬃcult to believe that now it is time to close this
endless period of my life.
If I look back and evaluate the results of this thesis, I cannot avoid thinking that for me
the most important achievement has been the colleagues, now friends, that I have met. All the
lonely hours spent in this thesis along so many years are worthwhile because of those people.
This is why I would like to thank those that have directly or indirectly supported me in these
years.
The roots of this thesis lie in my experience at the European Space Agency in 1997. Amongst
other tasks, I was assigned the design of an automated diagnosis system for satellite ground
stations. Thanks to Ram´on Segura, who was the one that ﬁrst saw the necessity of such a
system and who was my supervisor at the beginning of the work.
Thanks to Klaus-J¨urgen
Schulz, the section head, who supported me to do the diagnosis study, despite taking up a lot
of time from my other “operational” activities.
In 1999, I came back to Spain after two years in Germany. The change was quite frustrating
at the beginning. I missed the team work and the meetings of my previous work compared to the
more independent way of researching at university. At this point, thanks to Carlos Camacho,
who (once more) gave me the opportunity to work at Nokia when a research center was open at
M´alaga. This was just what I needed at that time.
After some months, Nokia decided to start a project on automatic troubleshooting in cellular
networks. Because of my previous experience, this project ﬁtted perfectly with my interests and,
at the same time, gave me the opportunity to start my thesis on that topic. On the one hand,
there was a risk of Nokia closing the project (as actually happened some years later) letting
my thesis unﬁnished. On the other hand, the time dedicated to my thesis was less than if I
would have done a more conventional thesis because only part of the time I spent in Nokia
could be used for my thesis. However, the experience of working in a team with staﬀin Spain,
Denmark and UK was excellent. Thanks to all my colleagues in that project for the very good
moments that we shared. Thanks to Sagar Patel, our link with operators, for being such a good
friend and phoning me so often, in spite of living in UK. Thanks to Lars Moltsen, who was the
ﬁrst to propose Bayesian Networks, for doing work such an enjoyable activity. Thanks to Rafael
Guerrero, my KAT man, for bearing me when I wrote such awful equations and speciﬁcations for
the tool (and he even implemented them!). Thanks to Gustavo Hylander, Martti Partanen and
Volker Wille, who were able to create a wonderful team spirit in which everyone had something
to contribute with. I will never forget our meetings in M´alaga. I owe this team much of this
thesis.
Unfortunately, after three years, the Nokia center in M´alaga was disbanded and with it
the troubleshooting project disappeared. Some months later, I was invited to participate in
a MICYT project, which was a support for this thesis. Thanks to all my colleagues in this
project. Thanks to Mat´ıas Toril for his wise advice and fruitful cooperation. Thanks to Mariano
Fern´andez, for doing the project so easy-going, for being so honest and for giving me the freedom
to carry out any initiative I had on the project.
From 2004, I had the chance to participate in the Gandalf project. A lot has happened since
we started until now that we are just about to ﬁnish the project. I remember our ﬁrst meeting
MENÚ

in April in Paris. Although troubleshooting was not even going to be part of the project, in
that meeting we started to consider it. And now that we are at the end, troubleshooting has
grown to be a third part of the Gandalf project. Thanks to all members of the Gandalf team
for creating such a great working environment. Specially, thanks to Zwi Altman, for being such
a good manager, so exhaustive in his work (he even followed every single algorithm that was
developed for the project!) and open-minded to accept any proposal anyone in the group may
have. Thanks to those who have worked with me in the troubleshooting part of the project:
Lars Moltsen, Pedro L´azaro, Herve Dubreil, Beatriz Solana, Jordi Triola, Rana Khanafer and
Sasikanth Munagala. I am looking forward to our next meetings in Berlin and Paris.
Finally, the circle has closed.
The start of this thesis was diagnosis in satellite ground
stations. Now that the Gandalf project has almost ﬁnished, we have just started a new ESA
project for automatic diagnosis in satellite communication equipment. Thanks to Lars Moltsen
for inviting me to participate in it and for believing in me.
Thanks to my two supervisors, Luis D´ıez and Volker Wille, specially for their help in making
this document readable (what a disaster the ﬁrst draft was!).
Thanks to Finn Jensen and
the people at his department for their warm welcome and support during the two weeks I
spent in Aalborg. Thanks to Jos´e Mar´ıa Hermoso and Jos´e Antonio Fern´andez, who worked in
troubleshooting with me for their ﬁnal master thesis.
Thanks to all the people who have been with me all these years, fulﬁlling other areas of my
life so necessary to make me focus on this thesis. Thanks to my parents and my sister for being
always by my side, being content with the little time that my busy life left for being with them.
I owe the numbers to my father and the letters to my mother. Thanks to Pedro for following me
in every new restless challenge I undertake and for bearing the constant “I cannot do anything
because of my thesis”. Thanks to my close friends Pedro, Javi and Ale for being an essential
component of my spare time and for being always there when I need them. Thanks to ´Alvaro for
being with me so many years, despite the diﬀerent countries that we have always had in between.
Thanks to Marco, Javier, Juan, Kris and Lionel for making me miss living in Germany. Thanks
to my friends from the painting class who helped me to forget about engineering for a few
hours every week. Thanks to my colleagues in the Ingenier´ıa de Comunicaciones Department,
for creating such a nice working environment, specially to those who go down for coﬀee-time
without having coﬀee and to those that have made me enjoy having lunch at university. Thanks
to my students, who give sense to my work at university. And, ﬁnally, thanks to all the teachers
that I have had along my life because this thesis is also due to them.

Abstract
The mobile telecommunication industry has experienced signiﬁcant changes in the recent past and it will
continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The introduction of GSM based mobile communications
in the early 90s has revolutionised the way people communicate. Prior to the launch of these systems,
the majority of voice traﬃc was carried over plain old telephone systems and phones were associated to
places rather than to people. At the same time, data communication has also undergone major changes.
Due to applications such as e-mail and other internet based services, our communication behaviour is
completely diﬀerent from what it was less than 15 years ago.
The introduction of new features, services and technologies is still shaping and changing the commu-
nication industry. For example, the wide availability of WLAN-based broadband access and the launch
of telephony based on WLAN is likely to revolutionise our communication pattern again. This change
is potentially posing a real threat to the mobile communication business. Therefore, cellular network
operators have to ﬁnd ways to reduce the cost of their services and improve their quality to counter the
threat posed by the emerging technologies.
In a mature cellular network that has undergone most of its site roll-out, the major cost is associated
to the operation of the network. As the network consists of a high number of pieces of equipment that are
distributed across the entire country, maintaining and operating this large and technically complicated
system is a diﬃcult task that requires operator personnel around the clock in several regional oﬃces. For
example, GSM networks in Europe may consist of about 10000 sites covering the entire country. Due to
the large size of the networks, it is common that some of the deployed pieces of equipment do not work
as planned. The consequence of such problems is poor end-user service. As in most countries several
operators are competing for subscribers, it is imperative to rectify such occurrences because otherwise
users will naturally switch to competing network operators. Hence, fault management, also called trou-
bleshooting (TS), is a key aspect of the operation of a cellular system in a competitive environment. As
the Radio Access Network (RAN) of cellular systems is by far the biggest part of the network, most of
the TS activities are focused on this area.
TS comprises the isolation of faulty cells (fault detection), the identiﬁcation of the fault causes
(diagnosis) and the proposal and deployment of healing actions (solution deployment). Currently, in
most cellular networks TS is a manual process, accomplished by RAN experts. Their task is to resolve
problems in the network that have been identiﬁed by other employees or by automated checking routines.
During the TS procedure, several applications and databases have to be queried to analyze performance
indicators, cell conﬁguration and alarms of the cells.
Amongst troubleshooting tasks, diagnosis of the cause of faults is the most complex and time-
consuming one.
Surprisingly, very few references can be found on automatic diagnosis in the RAN
of cellular networks. Thus, the aim of this thesis is to study how to automate diagnosis for the RAN of
cellular networks.
The ﬁrst part of the thesis consists of a survey on how troubleshooting is currently performed in
existing cellular networks. This part is considered to be essential for the rest of the thesis because the
troubleshooting procedure is not documented in the existing literature, despite the fact that it is one of
the main activities of operators of cellular networks.
Diﬀerent techniques have been proposed for automatic diagnosis in other application domains. Amongst
them, those based on Bayesian Networks (BNs) provide a modeling approach suitable to cater for the
uncertainty inherent in human reasoning. This, as well as other beneﬁts of BNs, together with the com-
plexity of the problem under study, has focused this thesis on the study of automated diagnosis based on
BNs.
In this thesis, two components of the diagnosis system have been distinguished: the model and the

inference method. The model represents the knowledge on how the identiﬁcation of fault causes is carried
out. The elements of the model are causes, symptoms and related parameters (named conditions). The
inference method is the algorithm that identiﬁes the cause of the problems based on the value of the
symptoms and the conditions.
The model is determined by random variables, which represent the causes, symptoms and conditions,
as well as probability functions, which model the relationship among these variables.
Two types of
diagnosis systems have been proposed in this thesis, depending on how symptoms have been modelled:
either as continuous or discrete random variables. Firstly, the Bayesian Classiﬁer (BC) models symptoms
as continuous variables. In this case, the main diﬃculty in model deﬁnition lies in the speciﬁcation of
the conditional probability density function (pdfs) of the symptoms given the causes. In this thesis, it
has been proposed to approximate those pdfs by beta pdfs.
In the second type of proposed systems, discrete BNs, the symptoms are modelled as discrete random
variables. In this case, a technique traditionally used in order to simplify model construction is to assume
a given network structure. That is, certain independence relationships among the variables are assumed.
In that way, the problem of BN deﬁnition is simpliﬁed to the speciﬁcation of the nodes and probability
tables of a network with a given structure. In this thesis, diﬀerent network structures have been selected,
which take into account the fact that the simplicity in creating and using the model is a key issue in the
cellular network domain.
Once the structure of the BN has been ﬁxed, the parameters of the diagnosis model have to be
deﬁned, which can be done according to two solutions. Firstly, the model may be deﬁned by diagnosis
experts. Accordingly, in this thesis, a method to convert the speciﬁcations provided by experts in natural
language into suitable diagnosis models has been described. Alternatively, the model can be constructed
from training/example cases. Consequently, algorithms to learn the parameters of the model (thresholds
for discretized variables and probabilities for the BN) have also been proposed in this thesis.
Contrary to other application domains, such as medical diagnosis, for which repositories of machine
learning databases have been created and maintained, in cellular systems there are no databases of
classiﬁed cases.
This is the reason why in most cases the model has to be based on knowledge, i.e.
experts deﬁne the model parameters.
When the number of parameters to be set is large, which is
normally the case, inaccuracy in setting these parameters is unavoidable due to multiple reasons. Hence,
in this thesis two methods to minimise diagnosis error of models due to inaccurate parameters have been
proposed.
Although the methods for automatic diagnosis proposed in this thesis are valid for any cellular network
(2G, 3G or even future networks), they have been applied to diagnosis in GSM (2G). Thus, a secondary
objective of this thesis has been to propose a model for automatic diagnosis in GSM. With this aim in
mind, the main fault causes in GSM, their symptoms and conditions have been identiﬁed and interrelated.
Once the diagnosis systems are designed, they have to be evaluated. Firstly, in order to overcome
the lack of cases from live networks, an algorithm has been developed to simulate training and test cases.
Secondly, a methodology has been proposed to assess the performance and to compare the diﬀerent
diagnosis systems presented in this thesis. Two aspects have been considered: the performance, measured
by diﬀerent ﬁgures of merit, and the sensitivity of the results to imprecision in model parameters. Finally,
the diagnosis systems presented in this thesis have been evaluated according to the previously described
procedures.

Resumen
La industria de comunicaciones m´oviles ha experimentado cambios signiﬁcativos en los ´ultimos a˜nos y,
previsiblemente, en el futuro continuar´a evolucionando con rapidez. La introducci´on de la telefon´ıa basada
en tecnolog´ıa GSM a principios de los 90 revolucion´o el modo en que la gente se comunicaba. Antes del
lanzamiento de dicho servicio, la mayor´ıa del tr´aﬁco de voz se transportaba por la red telef´onica b´asica y
los tel´efonos estaban asociados con lugares en lugar de con personas. Al mismo tiempo, la comunicaci´on
de datos tambi´en ha sufrido grandes cambios. Debido a aplicaciones, como el e-mail y otros servicios
basados en internet, las comunicaciones dentro de la sociedad son muy diferentes de lo que eran hace
menos de 15 a˜nos.
La introducci´on de nuevas funcionalidades, servicios y tecnolog´ıas est´a a´un moldeando las telecomuni-
caciones. Por ejemplo, es probable que la extensa disponibilidad de acceso inal´ambrico de banda ancha y
el lanzamiento de la telefon´ıa basada en WLAN revolucione otra vez el mundo de las comunicaciones. Por
tanto, los operadores de redes celulares deben encontrar medios para reducir los costes de sus servicios y
mejorar la calidad para contrarrestar la amenaza de las tecnolog´ıas emergentes.
En una red celular madura que ha experimentado la mayor parte de su despliegue, el mayor coste
est´a asociado a la operaci´on de la red. Como la red consta de numerosos equipos distribuidos a lo largo
de todo el pa´ıs, mantener y operar este sistema complejo es una tarea dif´ıcil que requiere personal de
forma permanente en muchas oﬁcinas regionales. Por ejemplo, las redes GSM en un pa´ıs europeo de
tama˜no medio pueden consistir en unos 10000 emplazamientos. Debido al gran tama˜no de las redes, es
frecuente que alg´un equipo no funcione como estaba planeado. Esos problemas tiene como consecuencia
la prestaci´on de un servicio deﬁciente a los usuarios ﬁnales. Como, en la mayor´ıa de los los pa´ıses, diversos
operadores compiten por los clientes, es fundamental solucionar dichos problemas inmediatamente porque
de otra forma los usuarios se cambiar´an a redes de la competencia. Por tanto, la gesti´on de fallos, tambi´en
llamada resoluci´on de problemas (troubleshooting, TS), es un aspecto clave de la operaci´on de un sistema
celular en un entorno competitivo. Como la Red de Acceso Radio (Radio Access Network, RAN) de
los sistemas celulares es la parte m´as importante de la red, la mayor parte de las actividades de TS se
concentran en este ´area.
El TS engloba el aislamiento de las celdas con fallos (detecci´on de fallos), la identiﬁcaci´on de las causas
de esos fallos (diagnosis) y la propuesta y realizaci´on de acciones correctivas (recuperaci´on de fallos).
Actualmente, en la mayor´ıa de las redes celulares, el TS es un proceso manual, llevado a cabo por expertos
en la RAN. Su tarea consiste en resolver los problemas de la red que han sido identiﬁcados previamente
por otro personal de la empresa o por rutinas autom´aticas de chequeo. Durante el procedimiento de TS,
se debe consultar m´ultiples aplicaciones y bases de datos para analizar los indicadores de funcionamiento,
la conﬁguraci´on y las alarmas de las celdas.
Entre las tareas de gesti´on de fallos, la diagnosis es la m´as compleja y la que requiere m´as tiempo.
Sorprendentemente, existen muy pocas referencias bibliogr´aﬁcas sobre la diagnosis autom´atica en la RAN
de redes celulares. Por eso, el objetivo de esta tesis ha sido estudiar como automatizar la diagnosis en la
RAN de redes celulares.
La primera parte de la tesis ha consistido en una investigaci´on sobre c´omo se lleva a cabo la gesti´on
de fallos en las redes celulares actuales. Esta parte se ha considerado esencial para el resto de la tesis,
ya que el procedimiento de TS no est´a documentado en la literatura existente, a pesar de ser una las
actividades principales de los operadores de redes celulares.
En otros dominios de aplicaci´on se han propuesto diversas t´ecnicas para la diagnosis autom´atica.
Entre ellas, las basadas en Redes Bayesianas (Bayesian Networks, BN) proporcionan una aproximaci´on
al modelado adecuada para tratar la incertidumbre inherente al razonamiento humano. Esto, adem´as de
otras ventajas de las BNs, junto con la complejidad del problema bajo estudio, han centrado esta tesis
vii
MENÚ
SALIR

en el estudio de sistemas autom´aticos de diagnosis basados en BNs.
En esta tesis, se han distinguido dos componentes del sistema de diagnosis: el modelo y el m´etodo de
inferencia. El modelo representa el conocimiento de c´omo se lleva a cabo la identiﬁcaci´on de la causa de los
fallos. Los elementos del modelo son causas, s´ıntomas y par´ametros relacionados (llamados condiciones).
El m´etodo de inferencia es el algoritmo que identiﬁca la causa de los problemas en funci´on del valor de
los s´ıntomas y las condiciones.
El modelo queda determinado por variables aleatorias, que representan las causas, s´ıntomas y condi-
ciones, y por funciones de probabilidad, que modelan las relaciones entre las variables. En esta tesis se
han propuesto dos tipos de sistemas de diagnosis, dependiendo de c´omo se han modelado los s´ıntomas:
como variables aleatorias continuas o discretas. En primer lugar, el Clasiﬁcador Bayesiano modela los
s´ıntomas como variables continuas. En este caso, la principal diﬁcultad en la deﬁnici´on del modelo radica
en la especiﬁcaci´on de las funciones densidad de probabilidades (fdps) de los s´ıntomas dadas las causas.
En esta tesis se ha propuesto aproximar esas fdps por funciones beta.
En el segundo tipo de sistema propuesto, BNs discretas, los s´ıntomas se modelan como variables
aleatorias discretas. Uno de los principales inconvenientes de las BNs es la diﬁcultad para deﬁnir modelos
complejos. Por eso, una t´ecnica usada con frecuencia para simpliﬁcar la construcci´on del modelo es asumir
una determinada estructura de red. Es decir, se suponen ciertas relaciones de independencia entre las
variables. De esta forma, el problema de deﬁnir la BN se simpliﬁca a la especiﬁcaci´on de los nodos y
tablas de probabilidad de una red con una estructura dada. En esta tesis, se han seleccionado diferentes
estructuras, que tienen en cuenta que la sencillez en la creaci´on y uso del sistema de diagnosis es un factor
clave en la gesti´on de redes celulares.
Una vez que se ha ﬁjado la estructura de la BN, se deben deﬁnir los par´ametros del modelo de
diagnosis, lo cual puede hacerse de dos formas.
En primer lugar, el modelo puede ser deﬁnido por
expertos en diagnosis.
De acuerdo a esto, en esta tesis se ha descrito un m´etodo para convertir las
especiﬁcaciones proporcionadas por expertos en lenguaje natural en modelos de diagnosis adecuados.
Como alternativa, el modelo puede aprenderse a partir de casos de entrenamiento. Consecuentemente,
se han propuesto tambi´en en esta tesis algoritmos para aprender a partir de datos los par´ametros del
modelo (umbrales para variables discretizadas y probabilidades para la BN).
Al contrario que en otros dominios de aplicaci´on, como en el diagn´ostico m´edico, en el que existen
numerosas bases de datos para aprendizaje, en sistemas celulares no se dispone de dichas bases de datos de
casos clasiﬁcados. Por esa raz´on, en muchas ocasiones, el modelo debe estar basado en el conocimiento, es
decir, los expertos deben deﬁnir sus par´ametros. Cuando el n´umero de par´ametros es demasiado grande,
lo cual suele ocurrir con frecuencia, la imprecisi´on en la deﬁnici´on de los par´ametros es inevitable debido
a m´ultiples motivos. Por eso, en esta tesis se han propuesto dos m´etodos para disminuir los errores en el
diagn´ostico de modelos sujetos a par´ametros imprecisos.
Aunque los m´etodos propuestos en esta tesis son v´alidos para cualquier red celular (2G, 3G o incluso
futuras redes), se han aplicado a la diagnosis en GSM (2G). Por tanto, un objetivo secundario de esta
tesis ha sido proponer un modelo para la diagnosis autom´atica en GSM. Con este prop´osito, se han
identiﬁcado e interrelacionado las principales causas de fallos en GSM, sus s´ıntomas y condiciones.
Una vez que se han dise˜nado, los sistemas de diagnosis deben ser evaluados. En primer lugar, para
suplir la falta de casos de redes reales, se ha desarrollado un algoritmo para simular casos de prueba y
de entrenamiento. En segundo lugar, se ha propuesto una metodolog´ıa para valorar el funcionamiento y
comparar los distintos sistemas de diagnosis presentados en esta tesis. Se han considerado dos aspectos:
el funcionamiento, medido mediante diferentes ﬁguras de m´erito, y la sensibilidad de los resultados a
imprecisiones en los par´ametros del modelo. Finalmente, los sistemas de diagnosis presentados en esta
tesis se han evaluado de acuerdo a los procedimientos anteriormente descritos.

Introduction
The aim of this chapter is to explain the purpose of this thesis and its motivation, to describe
its objectives and to present the organization of this document.
1.1
Motivation
There is no doubt that during the last decade mobile communications have played an increasingly
important role in telecommunications business, and it will continue to do so in the years to come.
In most developed countries, the number of mobile telephones has exponentially growth over the
last 10 years, in many countries even exceeding the number of inhabitants. Even for domestic
use, the predominance of mobile over ﬁx telephony is already a reality. For example, in Spain at
the beginning of 2006 the penetration of mobile telephony at homes was 84.3%, whereas 83.5%
of the homes had a traditional ﬁx line [31].
The mobile communication industry is currently evolving from Second Generation (2G)
towards Third Generation (3G). In the process, more functionalities and new technologies are
gradually being added to the existing 2G networks. The ﬁrst 2G cellular networks, which were
introduced in the early 1990s, were based on Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)
technology. The evolution began with an upgrade of the GSM network to 2.5G by introducing
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology. GPRS provides GSM with a packet data air
interface and an IP-based core network. Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution (EDGE),
which is based on the introduction of a higher speed modulation and improved coding scheme,
was a further evolutionary step of GSM packet data. EDGE can handle about three times more
data subscribers than GPRS, or triple the data rate for one end-user. GERAN (GSM/EDGE
Radio Access Network) is the radio access technology based on GSM/EDGE. In the last years,
3G networks, called Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS) networks in Europe,
have started to be deployed throughout the world. In the near future, thanks to 3G, mobile
internet-services are expected to be available “anywhere and anytime”. Users will surf the Web,
check the email, download ﬁles or have real time videoconference, in a shopping mall, the airport,
the city center or their oﬃces.
Thus, the current scenario comprises a complex set of interrelated and rapidly growing

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
wireless networks, applications which require increasing bandwidth and users who demand high
quality of service at low cost, but with a limited spectrum. In a few years, the highly complex
and heterogeneous RAN will comprise diﬀerent technologies, such as GSM, UMTS and WLAN1.
As a result, the management of the RAN will be a tough challenge that the operators will have
to tackle.
In addition, new technologies are foreseen to revolutionise the industry of telecommunica-
tions. For example, the increasing expansion of IP telephony, the wide availability of WLAN
based broadband access or the launch of telephony based on WLAN (e.g. Skype [6]) is po-
tentially posing a real threat to the business of mobile operators. Therefore cellular network
operators have to ﬁnd ways to reduce the cost of their services and improve their quality to
counter the threat posed by the emerging technology.
In a mature cellular network that has undergone most of its site roll-out, the major cost is
associated to the operation of the network. As the network consists of a high number of pieces
of equipment that are distributed across the entire country, maintaining and operating this large
and technically complicated system is a diﬃcult task that requires operator personnel around
the clock in several regional oﬃces. For example, GSM networks in Europe may consist of about
10.000 sites covering the entire country. Due to the large size of the networks, it is common that
some of the deployed equipment does not work as planned. The consequence of such problems
is poor end-user service. As, in most countries, several operators are competing for subscribers,
it is imperative to rectify such occurrences because otherwise users will be dissatisﬁed with the
service and thus will likely switch to competing network operators. Hence, fault management,
also called troubleshooting (TS), is a key aspect of operating a cellular system in a competitive
environment. As the Radio Access Network2 (RAN) of cellular systems is by far the biggest
part of the network, most of the TS activities are focused in this area.
TS comprises the isolation of faulty cells (fault detection), the identiﬁcation of malfunctions
(diagnosis) and the proposal and deployment of healing actions (solution deployment/fault re-
covery). Currently, in most cellular networks, TS is a manual process, accomplished by RAN
experts. These engineers are applying a series of customized checking routine on a daily basis
in order to identify the cause of the problem. During the procedure, several applications and
databases have to be queried to analyze performance indicators, cell conﬁgurations and alarms.
The speed in identifying faults is dependent on the level of expertise of the troubleshooter, the
type of information available and the quality of the tools displaying relevant pieces of infor-
mation. This means that, in addition to a good understanding of the possible causes of the
problems, a very good understanding of the tools available to access the sources of information
is also required.
In this scenario, the beneﬁts of automating TS are numerous. With the help of an automated
TS tool, the time required to identify the reason for a fault causing a problem is greatly reduced.
1WLAN: Wireless Local Area Network
2The Radio Access Network (RAN) is the part of the network in charge of providing access to the users and
connecting them to the core network. The wireless access is one of the key characteristics of mobile communication
networks, which identiﬁes them and diﬀerentiates them from traditional wired networks.

This means that network performance is enhanced as the downtime and the time with reduced
quality of service (QoS) is signiﬁcantly limited. In addition, by automating the TS process, fewer
personnel and, thus, fewer operational costs are necessary to maintain a network of a given size.
The TS process is de-skilled as the majority of problems can be rectiﬁed with the help of the
automated TS tool. Then, the knowledge of highly experienced staﬀ, which is released from the
TS work, can be utilized for other aspects of network optimization, thereby further increasing
network performance. One additional beneﬁt is that the knowledge in TS can be stored in the
TS tool, therefore not being dependent on the staﬀworking for the company at any time. In
conclusion, the gains achieved thanks to automated TS for an operator are signiﬁcant as fewer
personnel with a lower skill level can solve more network problems in less time.
The ﬁrst steps in automation of troubleshooting in the RAN of cellular networks have been
focused on performance visualization and on fault detection (FD) [124, 47, 132, 123, 104, 133, 48].
On the one hand, thanks to methods to achieve eﬃcient visualization of the network performance,
FD and diagnosis are carried out more easily. On the other hand, several methods have been
proposed for FD, which consist in building models for the normal behavior of the system. The
deviations of the available measurement variables from the normal behavior can then be detected
with some type of abnormality detector.
Amongst troubleshooting tasks, diagnosis of faults is the most complex and time-consuming
one. However, very few references can be found on automatic diagnosis in the RAN of cellular
networks. This is the reason why in this thesis other application domains where diagnosis is also
required have been surveyed. Based on that survey, the selected technique in this thesis has been
Bayesian Networks (BNs). BNs, also called belief probabilistic networks, have been proposed by
many authors as the modelling technique for the development of automatic diagnosis systems.
Some application domains are the diagnosis of diseases in medicine [34, 146, 99, 199, 35, 154,
147, 144], the troubleshooting of printer failures [96, 51, 100, 94, 98, 101, 174, 111, 175, 173],
the diagnosis of faults in satellite communication systems [107, 131, 57] and fault identiﬁcation
in the core network (CN) part of communication networks [115, 182, 190, 73]. The latter is the
closest ﬁeld to the RAN, although it has very important diﬀerences. On the one hand, in CNs, it
is very important to represent the dependencies among communication system entities because,
due to the highly interconnected architecture, a failure in an entity may have a large impact on
other system entities. On the other hand, in general, in CNs the only type of symptoms are the
alarms related to the network entities. In the RAN part of cellular systems, this interconnection
is not as strong and alarms are not the only symptoms of malfunction, due to two main reasons.
Firstly, most faults are not related to a physical component, but to a poor network planning
or an incorrect parameter setting.
Thus, modelling the interactions among entities is not a
requirement like in other communication networks because, in most cases, faults are not related
to pieces of equipment which are physically connected. Secondly, although alarms play a very
important role in identifying faults in speciﬁc pieces of equipment, they do not provide conclusive
information in order to isolate conﬁguration problems. Furthermore, the fact that performance
indicators in the RAN domain are continuous, instead of binary like alarms, generates a new
diﬃculty in the modelling, which is nonexistent in the CN domain.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
Research studies in automation of diagnosis in the RAN of cellular networks have been
focused on alarm correlation [193, 84, 192, 88]. In current cellular networks, most systems are
semi-intelligent and generate alarm messages when errors occur. The abstraction level of these
alarm messages is normally very low, leading to a high number of alarms for any single cause.
For example, when a link fails, up to 100 or more alarms are generated and passed to the
Network Management System. Those alarms should be converted into a minimum number of
alarms which clearly pinpoint to the breakdown of a link. Alarm correlation [109, 202] consists
in the conceptual interpretation of multiple alarms, so that new meanings are assigned to the
original alarms. It is a process that involves diﬀerent tasks: reduction of multiple occurrences of
an alarm into a single alarm, inhibition of low priority alarms in the presence of higher priority
alarms, substitution of a speciﬁc set of correlated alarms by a new one, etc. This way, alarm
correlation systems are required to ﬁlter and condense the incoming alarms to meaningful high
level alarms in order to avoid overloading the operators. Although alarm correlation can be
considered a ﬁrst step in the diagnosis of faults, alarms do not provide enough information to
identify the cause of problems, especially if the possible causes are not only faults in pieces of
equipment. Even after alarm correlation, the number of triggered alarms for a single cause is
normally very high. In addition, the same alarms may be triggered by diﬀerent causes. Due to
these reasons, in order to achieve a conclusive diagnosis, it is important that not only alarms
are taken into account, but also network performance indicators. Because of the lack of studies
related to this last aspect, this thesis is focused on automatic diagnosis in the RAN of cellular
networks based on performance indicators.

Preliminaries
In the year 2000, Nokia Networks opened a Research Center for Mobile Communications at the
Parque Tecnol´ogico de Andaluc´ıa (PTA) in M´alaga. This center was created in the framework
of a cooperation agreement between Nokia and the University of M´alaga (in particular with
the Grupo de Ingenier´ıa de Comunicaciones). The staﬀwas composed of experienced Nokia
personnel, as well as more than 50 new employees and lecturers from University of Malaga.
One of the projects that was started in the new Nokia center, in 2001, was a Troubleshoot-
ing project. Its aim was to design an automatic troubleshooting tool for the RAN of cellular
networks. Nokia considered it essential to open a line of research in this area because of the
reasons explained in Section 1.1. Building an automatic troubleshooting tool was not trivial at
all as it required knowledge from very diverse ﬁelds. To begin with, it was necessary to have
the theoretical knowledge to select the most appropriate artiﬁcial intelligence method for the
area under study. Then, there was a need to fully understand the area to which this method
could be applied, i.e. the troubleshooting in the RAN of a cellular network. Finally, the skill of
turning this knowledge into a usable tool that interfaces with the other hardware and software
already in use by the operator was essential. After several fruitless attempts by ﬁrst Nokia alone,
and then Nokia and the University of Malaga, it became clear that only the close co-operation
between a network operator, a research unit and an equipment manufacturer could provide the

three above-mentioned skills. Firstly, an equipment vendor like Nokia, can provide alarms (i.e.
“when a value is below/above a certain level”) and performance indicators, but only TS en-
gineers from network operators know about the actual meaning (or lack of meaning) of such
alarms and performance indicators in actual networks. This knowledge can not be simulated
or predicted, but it has to be acquired via years of hands-on experience. However, although
the TS engineers have the TS knowledge, they generally lack the theoretical bases on automatic
TS systems (e.g. which artiﬁcial intelligence technique to use, how this work, how to create
the TS system, etc). Secondly, engineers from manufacturers of network equipment are not
only experts in equipment, but they also have a general knowledge on mobile communications.
Finally, researchers from university provide their expertise in theory of mobile communications
and artiﬁcial intelligence.
The troubleshooting group was composed of staﬀin Spain, UK and Denmark. Moreover, the
group worked with operators in UK and Denmark. My responsibility was the research part of
the project, and that constituted the starting point of this thesis. Later, I was not only involved
in research, but also in the speciﬁcation of prototypes for diagnosis and in meetings with cellular
networks operators.
Operators would only be interested in a cooperation if the TS tool could demonstrate its
ability in their networks. Furthermore, in order to deﬁne an accurate model, the prototype
had to be constantly tested with operators. As the initiative was driven by Nokia, the aim
was to provide a “platform” on which the operator knowledge could be ﬁrst gathered and then
executed. Thus, two prototype tools were implemented: a troubleshooting tool, which carried
out the automatic diagnosis, and a knowledge acquisition tool, which obtained the knowledge
from TS experts and built the TS model. In addition, a TS model for GERAN was created
thanks to the cooperation with the network operators. Bayesian Networks were the technique
used to deploy the automatic TS system. The TS model was based on knowledge only, that is,
no previous examples were used to obtain the parameters of the model.
Unfortunately, due to major re-structuring, Nokia closed its entire center in M´alaga in June
2003 and, consequently, the troubleshooting project was also stopped. However, as deﬁning
an automatic TS system was still an important pending issue in current and future cellular
networks, and the objectives of my thesis were clear, my research continued on this topic.
Some months later, other projects came to support this thesis. Firstly, in 2003, the Spanish
Ministry of Science and Technology funded a research project of the Communication Engineering
Department named “Radio resources optimisation tools for mobile communication networks”.
One of the lines of this project was automatic diagnosis.
In addition, in 2004 a project called “Gandalf: Monitoring and self-tuning of RRM parame-
ters in a multi-system network” [3, 2] was started by a consortium composed by France Telecom
R&D, the University of Limerick, Telef´onica R&D, Moltsen Intelligence Software and the Uni-
versity of M´alaga. One of the work packages was automatic diagnosis in multi-system cellular
networks. This project was started due to the continuing interest of cellular operators in this
area of work. The project was assigned a CELTIC label [1] within the EUREKA European
network [4]. As one of the results of this project, a commercial automatic troubleshooting tool,

Objectives
The main aim of this thesis is the design of an automatic diagnosis system for the RAN segment
of cellular networks. Fig.1.1 summarizes the scenario and the location of the speciﬁc objectives
(squared yellow boxes) of this thesis. Firstly, a case is deﬁned as a set composed of a fault cause
in a cell and the value of its symptoms and related parameters. As observed in Fig.1.1, cases can
be obtained from two sources: a live cellular network and a case simulator. At this point, one of
the objectives of the thesis (5.a) is to deﬁne methods to simulate cases. Cases can be used for
two diﬀerent purposes: as training examples for model learning or as test cases for diagnosis. In
the former, another aim of the thesis can be found (4.a): to design methods to learn the model
parameters based on training cases. Alternatively, model parameters can be elicited by diagnosis
expert. Hence, another objective (4.b) is to develop techniques to ease knowledge acquisition.
Experts may build a speciﬁc model for diagnosis in GERAN. The deﬁnition of that model is
deﬁned in objective (2). Another objective (3.a) is the proposal of diverse techniques to model
diagnosis. In Fig.1.1 diﬀerent models (Model 1, Model 2) are represented, which diﬀer in the
modelling technique applied to build them. Once the model is deﬁned, and their parameters are
incorporated, it is used by the diagnosis system to assess the fault cause. At this point, another
objective (3.b) of the thesis is to deﬁne methods for automatic diagnosis. The inputs to the
diagnosis system are the symptoms and conﬁguration parameters in the test cases. In order to
evaluate the performance of the diagnosis system, its output, i.e. the diagnosed fault cause, is
compared with the real cause. At this point, an objective (5.b) is the deﬁnition of methods to
evaluate and compare diagnosis systems. In addition to the objectives shown in Fig.1.1, a prior
objective is the analysis of the state-of-the-art (1).
In summary, the objectives of this thesis can be structured in:
1. Problem approach.
At a ﬁrst stage, a survey on how troubleshooting is currently
performed in existing cellular networks should be carried out. This part is considered
to be very important because the troubleshooting procedure is not documented in the
existing literature. In addition, diﬀerent techniques for automatic diagnosis, which take
into account the inherent uncertainty in human reasoning, should be examined.
2. Diagnosis in GERAN. The techniques for automatic diagnosis proposed in this thesis
should be valid not only for 2G networks, but also for 3G and future cellular networks.
Nevertheless, a secondary objective of this thesis is to propose a system for automatic
diagnosis in GERAN. With this aim in mind, the main fault causes in GERAN, their
symptoms and other related parameters should be identiﬁed and interrelated.
3. Modelling of diagnosis. The main objective of the thesis is to develop methods (3.b)
to automatically diagnose the fault cause in the RAN of any cellular network.
Those
methods use a diagnosis model, which represents the knowledge on how the identiﬁcation

of faults should be done. The main elements of the model and its parameters should also
be investigated at this stage (3.a).
4. Model construction.
In order to deﬁne the parameters of the diagnosis model, two
alternative solutions should be analyzed. On the one hand, the model may be deﬁned
by diagnosis experts.
Hence, an objective (4.b) will be to study how to convert the
speciﬁcations provided in natural language by those experts into diagnosis models. This
is called knowledge acquisition. On the other hand, the model can be learnt from training
examples. Thus, another target (4.a) will be to develop methods to automatically learn
the parameters from those training cases.
5. Model evaluation.
The last objective is to design techniques to evaluate diagnosis
systems.
Firstly (5.a), an algorithm should be developed to generate cases, that is to
simulate the behavior of the network in the presence of faults (Case simulator). Secondly,
a set of evaluation methods will be proposed (5.b).
They will be used to assess the
performance and to compare the diﬀerent diagnosis systems presented in this thesis. Two
diﬀerent aspects will be considered: the performance measured by diﬀerent ﬁgures of merit
and the sensitivity of the results to imprecision in model parameters.

Guide for the reader
The organization of this thesis report (Fig.1.2) is directly related to the objectives presented
above. The ﬁrst chapter corresponds to this introduction to the thesis. The rest of the document
is organized in three parts.

comprises a review of the state-of-the-art of techniques used and of the theoretical basis of the
areas covered in this thesis. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of this work, this part has been
divided into two clearly distinguishable chapters within the disciplines of mobile communications
and artiﬁcial intelligence. Chapter 2 carries out a survey on automation and optimization and on

how troubleshooting is performed in current cellular networks. In addition, a brief introduction
to GSM is provided. Chapter 3 is focused on artiﬁcial intelligence techniques used in other
disciplines for automatic diagnosis. Amongst them, the most appropriate technique for cellular
networks is selected.
The second part of this document is devoted to the design of automatic diagnosis systems.
It is also composed of two chapters. Chapter 4 studies diagnosis in GERAN. Hence, the main
causes, symptoms and related parameters to be taken into account in diagnosis are analyzed in
this chapter. Chapter 5 proposes models and techniques to automate diagnosis, valid not only
for 2G networks, but also for 3G or future cellular networks.
Finally, the third part of the thesis is dedicated to the evaluation and comparison of the
systems proposed in Part II. In Chapter 6 the methodology to obtain simulated cases is described.
In addition, the design of the experiments, the methods for sensitivity analysis and the ﬁgures
of merit will be also explained in this chapter. Results obtained with the systems proposed in
Part II, following the previously explained evaluation methodology, are also presented in this
chapter and in appendixes A-D. Chapter 7 summarizes the main conclusions of the research
and proposes future lines of action.
This report also includes as appendix E a summary of the thesis in Spanish.

Automation and optimization in
cellular networks
This chapter outlines the importance of automation and optimization in cellular networks. In the
last few years, driven by the increasing complexity of networks, the attention of cellular network
operators is turning to the study of methods to achieve more eﬃcient network management.
On the one hand, the multi-service capabilities of 3G networks will bring new challenges to
network operation and maintenance. On the other hand, in the very near future, diﬀerent radio
access technologies, such as GSM, UMTS and IEEE 802.11 (WLAN) will coexist within the
same network. It will not be feasible to carry out the operation of these multi-system networks
with the manual procedures employed in current networks. Therefore, automation of network
management is crucial to face the forthcoming changes in the mobile telecommunication industry.
In this thesis, a methodology for automatic troubleshooting of the radio access part of cellular
networks is proposed. The described methods are valid for any network, such as 2G, 3G or
WLAN networks if minor modiﬁcations are applied. The proposed methodology has been applied
to build a diagnosis model for GSM/GPRS networks. The reason for choosing GSM is ﬁve-fold:
1) the existence of live networks from which to obtain data to build the models and test the
designed systems, 2) well established processes for TS (although not well documented in the
public domain), 3) stability of the software and HW used by operators 4) strong operator
interest due to cost pressure, 5) GSM will be used for many years to come.
This chapter is divided into two parts. In the ﬁrst part, the basics of GSM networks are
summarised. Special attention is drawn to those aspects of GSM required to follow the rest of
this thesis. The second part of the chapter is a survey on automation in mobile communica-
tion networks. Firstly, the importance of automation and optimisation in cellular networks is
highlighted. Subsequently, it is described how troubleshooting is carried out in current cellular
networks. Finally, the principles of automatic troubleshooting are presented and the state of
the art is analyzed.

2.1.1
Overview of the GSM system
The main characteristic of Public Land Mobile Networks (PLMN) is that they allow the user
to move within their coverage area.
The coverage area of a given operator is divided into
geographical areas referred as cells, each of them covered by a base station, i.e. mobiles in this
cell can connect to the ﬁxed part of the network via that base station through a radio link. The
user interface to the PLMN is the mobile station (MS).
Currently, the most deployed cellular network standard is by far GSM. Although the tech-
niques proposed in this thesis are also valid for other cellular networks, such as UMTS, models
have been built for GSM networks. Some basic characteristics and deﬁnitions related to GSM
are the following:
• Good speech quality comparable to that of ﬁxed networks.
• Support for new services and facilities.
• Authentication of users and equipment.
• Security in the calls.
• Interworking among equipment from diﬀerent manufacturers.
• Interworking with the existing ﬁxed networks (PSTN1, ISDN2, data networks, etc.).
• International roaming: with a unique number, clients can generate and receive calls from
most countries in the world.
• Location: at any moment the network must know where each subscriber is situated, so
that incoming calls can be routed.
• Paging: when there is an incoming call, the network must broadcast a signal to the MSs
in the location area3 where the MS destination of the call is situated.
• Handover (HO): it is the switching of an on-going call4 to a diﬀerent channel or cell. The
continuity of the call should be assured by the network.
There are numerous books and journals related to mobile communications and, in particular,
to GSM. For an introduction, readers are referred to [142, 161, 162, 145, 90, 7]. The following
sections are focused on those aspects of GSM that are more related to this thesis. In Section 2.1.2,
the architecture of the GSM network will be described. In Section 2.1.3, signalling protocols
in the radio interface will be summarized.
In Section 2.1.4, the channel structures will be
enumerated. Finally, in Section 2.1.5, network management will be introduced.

2.1.2
Architecture of the GSM network
The GSM network is hierarchically organized in subsystems (Fig.2.1), which in turn are com-
posed of functional entities. The Base Station Subsystem (BSS) controls the radio links with the
MSs. The Network and Switching Subsystem (NSS) performs the routing of calls and handles
the mobility management operations. The Operations and Maintenance Center (OMC), also
named Network Management System (NMS) and Operation Subsystem (OSS) is used to oversee
the proper operation and setup of the network. The interfaces between the subsystems and
entities are denoted by letters. The interface between the MSs and the network is the radio
interface, also referred as air interface or Um interface. The BSS is linked to the NSS through
the A interface.
The MS consists of the mobile equipment (the terminal) and a smart card called the Sub-
scriber Identity Module (SIM). The SIM provides personal mobility, so that the user can have
access to subscribed services irrespective of the speciﬁc terminal.
The mobile equipment is
uniquely identiﬁed by the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). The SIM card con-
tains the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) used to identify the subscriber to the
system, a secret key for authentication, and other information.
The BSS is in charge of providing and managing transmission paths between the MSs and
the NSS. It contains the Base Transceiver Stations (BTS) and the Base Station Controller
(BSC), which communicate across the A-bis interface.
There is a BTS in each cell, which
contains all the radio transmission and reception equipment: radio transmitters and receivers
(TRX), antennas, connection elements to the antennas, supplementary elements (towers, air
MENÚ
SALIR

16
CHAPTER 2. AUTOMATION AND OPTIMIZATION IN CELLULAR NETWORKS
conditioning, etc.).
The BTS is also in charge of the signal processing.
The BSC controls
several BTSs and it handles the radio interface management, e.g. allocation and release of radio
channels and handover management.
The NSS includes the main switching functions of GSM and the databases required for
subscriber data and mobility management. The main function of the Mobile Switching Center
(MSC) is call routing.
In addition, it provides other functionalities, such as the connection
to the ﬁxed networks (e.g.
PSTN or ISDN), registration, authentication, location updating
and handovers. There are four diﬀerent types of handover in GSM, which involve transferring
a call between: channels (time slots) in the same cell, cells (BTS) under the control of the
same BSC, cells under the control of diﬀerent BSCs, but belonging to the same MSC and cells
under the control of diﬀerent MSCs. The ﬁrst two types of handover, called internal handovers,
involve only a single BSC. They are managed by the BSC without involving the MSC, except
to notify it at the completion of the handover. The last two types of handover, called external
handovers, are handled by the involved MSCs. The MSC works in conjunction with several
functional entities. Thus, associated to each MSC there is a temporal database named Visitor
Location Register (VLR), which contains dynamic administrative information for each mobile
currently located in the geographical area controlled by that VLR, necessary for call control
and provision of the subscribed services. The Home Location Register (HLR) contains all the
administrative information of each subscriber registered in the corresponding GSM network,
along with the current location of the mobile. The location of the mobile is typically in the form
of the signalling address of the VLR associated with the mobile station. The other two registers
are used for authentication and security purposes. The Equipment Identity Register (EIR) is a
database that contains a list of all valid mobile equipment on the network, where each mobile is
identiﬁed by its IMEI. The Authentication Center (AuC) is a database that stores a copy of the
secret key saved in each subscriber’s SIM card, which is used for authentication and encryption
over the radio channel.
The NMS interacts with the BSS and NSS subsystem and it handles most aspects of the
network management. The main functions of the NMS can be divided into three categories:
fault management, performance management and conﬁguration management. The purpose of
the Fault Management is to ensure the smooth operation of the network and the rapid correction
of any kind of problems that are detected. Fault management provides the network operator
with information about the current status of alarm events and maintains a historical database
of alarms. The purpose of the Conﬁguration Management is to maintain up to date information
about the operation and conﬁguration status of the network elements and to enable eﬃcient
handling of these. In Performance Management, the NMS collects measurements from individual
network elements and stores them in a database. On the basis of these data, the network operator
can compare the actual performance of the network with the planned performance and detect
both good and bad performance areas within the network.
A typical network in a country the size of Spain may be composed of about 25000 BTSs,
200 BSCs, 60 MSCs and 3-10 NMSs.

This thesis is focused on the Radio Access Network (RAN5), which guarantees the connection
between the MSs and the core network. The RAN in GSM/GPRS, which is called GERAN,
comprises the MSs and the BSS.
2.1.3
Signalling protocols in the radio interface
Fig.2.2 shows the signalling protocols in the GSM RAN. Layer 1 is the physical layer of the radio
interface, which contains the functionalities required to transmit the information over the radio
channels. Hence, the physical layer is organized in physical and logical channels (see Section
2.1.4).
The physical layer is in charge of associating physical and logical channels, channel
coding, information ciphering, cell selection in idle mode and supervision of the communication
quality.
The aim of layer 2 is to establish a secure and reliable signalling link between the MS and
the network. The protocol is called LAPDm, which is based on a modiﬁcation of the LAPD
protocol used in ISDN.
Layer 3 is in charge of signalling between the MS and the network and it is composed of
three sublayers: RR, MM and CM. The Radio Resources Management (RR) sublayer controls
the setup, maintenance, and termination of both radio channels and connections with the MSC.
In addition, it handles the management of radio features such as power control, discontinuous
transmission and timing advance (see Chapter 4). The execution and measurements required
for handovers are also responsibility of the RR layer. The Mobility Management (MM) sublayer
handles the functions that arise from the mobility of the subscriber, as well as the authentication
and security aspects. The former implies the required procedures to update the location in the
VLR and HLR. Security includes the authentication of users to prove that they are who they

claim to be, identiﬁcation of mobile equipment, ciphering and assignation of temporal identities.
The Communication Management (CM) sublayer is responsible of procedures related to call
control and set-up, supplementary service management, and short message service management.
2.1.4
Channel structures
The GSM radio interface combines Frequency Division Multiplex Access (FDMA) with Time
Division Multiplex Access (TDMA). On the one hand, the frequency band is divided into 124
carrier frequencies spaced 200 kHz apart. One or more carrier frequencies are assigned to each
BTS. The radio links are duplex, that is two diﬀerent carriers are used for the uplink6 and for
the downlink7. Each pair of frequencies is denoted as a radiochannel. On the other hand, the
time is divided into frames and each frame is divided into 8 time slots of about 0.577 ms. In
this way, 8 physical channels are provided over each radiochannel. Therefore, a bidirectional
physical channel between a BTS and a MS is deﬁned by the radiochannel frequency and the
time slot assigned to that communication.
A logical channel is an information stream dedicated to the transfer of a speciﬁc type of
information over the radio interface [9]. Logical channels can be classiﬁed depending on their
usage into two groups: common channels and dedicated channels. Common channels are those
channels which transmit signalling information common to all mobiles in a cell. Amongst all the
carriers transmitted in a cell, one of them works as beacon carrier and its time slot 0 is used to
transmit the common channels. This carrier is denoted as BCCH carrier, because the BCCH
logical channel goes onto that carrier. The most important common channels are:
• FCCH (Frequency Correction Channel): It carries information from the BSS for
carrier synchronization.
• SCH (Synchronization channel): It carries information from the BSS for frame syn-
chronization.
• BCCH (Broadcast Control Channel): It broadcast on the downlink information such
as the BTS identity or the location area. This channel is continuously active because its
signal strength is monitored by mobiles for handover purposes.
• PCH (Paging Channel): It is used by the network to call for a mobile when it has an
incoming call.
• RACH: (Random Access Channel): it is used by the mobiles when they need to
access the network.
• AGCH (Access Grant Channel): It is used by the system to assign a dedicated channel
to a mobile.

Dedicated channels transmit information of an established connection between a MS and the
network. The most common dedicated channels are:
• TCH/F (Traﬃc Channel Full Rate) and TCH/H (Traﬃc Channel Half Rate):
They are the bidirectional traﬃc channels used to carry speech and data. There are two
types of TCH: full rate and half rate, which are distinguished by the channel period.
• SACCH (Slow Associated Control Channel): It is the signalling channel associated
to a traﬃc channel. It is used to transmit the required information to manage the radio
resources, such as downlink level and quality measurements.
• FACCH (Fast Associated Control Channel): It is a signalling channel associated to a
traﬃc channel. It is used to transmit information that cannot wait until the corresponding
SACCH arrives, such as the handover information.
• SDCCH (Stand alone Dedicated Control Channel): This channel is used for call
setup, location updating and transmission and reception of short messages.
Traﬃc channels are deﬁned using a 26-frame multiframe (i.e. a group of 26 TDMA frames).
Out of the 26 frames, 24 are used for traﬃc, one is used for the SACCH and one is currently
unused.
2.1.5
Network management
Diagnosis is one of the main tasks in network management. Network management is responsible
for the eﬃcient operation and organization of telecommunication networks. ISO8 together with
ITU9 standardized network management following the OSI Reference Model. Functional areas
deﬁned by the standard are:
• Fault management, which is responsible for detection, isolation and correction of network
faults.
• Conﬁguration management, which provides the operators with the means to deﬁne, control
and monitor network elements in order to maintain a reliable communication network
• Accounting management, which deals with managing the billing and charging system,
calculating the cost of network services
• Performance management, which handles the execution of performance measurements by
monitoring and analysing the managed network elements and services
• Security management, which ensures that the information exchanged by the network is
not corrupted.

CHAPTER 2. AUTOMATION AND OPTIMIZATION IN CELLULAR NETWORKS
Network management has always lagged behind network technology development due to the
following factors [176]:
• Management is seen as a non-functional requirement of networking systems and hence is
given lower research priority despite its importance for operators
• Management functions, especially conﬁguration management, depend on the attributes
and capabilities of the network entities being managed and are mostly vendor-speciﬁc
• Network management is by its nature a multi-vendor and multi-technology integration
problem; this ensures that turn-key solutions are very diﬃcult to develop.
Current networks, such as GSM, UMTS and WLAN still require signiﬁcant manual conﬁgura-
tion and management for deployment and operation. However, the rapid increase in complexity
and size of the networks being managed have led to a widespread belief that current management
models need to change to meet the challenges of future ubiquitous networking. Hence, recent
trends in network management research include the concept of automatic or self-organising sys-
tems (e.g. see [30] for self-organisation in mobile networking), although these are not present in
existing networks.
Amongst the functional areas of network management, in addition to fault management, this
thesis is specially focused on network performance because of its relation with diagnosis based
on performance indicators.
Network performance
In order to monitor network performance, three sources of information are normally considered
[14]: customer complaints, ﬁeld tests and statistics in the NMS.
Firstly, quality improvement should take place before customer complaints are numerous.
Based only on customer complaints it is diﬃcult to distinguish whether the problem is in the
MS or in the network. Therefore, it is not eﬃcient to optimize the whole network using only
this source of information. However, with good cooperation between the customer service and
the network optimization team within the company, it should be possible to take advantage of
customer complaints to improve network quality. For example, sometimes customer complaints
can help to ﬁnd not known problems and to identify their geographical location.
Secondly, ﬁeld tests are very resource and time consuming. They are normally restricted to
speciﬁc areas and, in most cases, they only supply information about the downlink path. There-
fore, optimization of the whole network is also not possible based only on drive tests, although
they may help to locate problems in certain areas. Furthermore, ﬁeld tests are useful to adjust
propagation models and to pinpoint coverage holes. Nevertheless, a common problem within
operators is that data from the ﬁeld tests are used to inform managers about the performance
of the network, but not to optimize it.
Therefore, statistics from the NMS are the main source of information used to determine
network quality and to carry out troubleshooting or optimization. The most important events

over a reporting measurement period (typically one hour) related to each cell are collected by the
BSC to which the cell is connected. These events can belong to two types: measurements, also
called counters, or alarms. Both counters and alarms are transmitted and stored in the NMS.
Standard measurements are collected continuously, whereas special ones may only be switched
on when required. Data in the NMS is usually stored for several days. The main drawback of
this source of information is that statistically relevant volumes of traﬃc are required to provide
reliable results. However, it has many advantages compared to the other sources mentioned
earlier: it is a cost eﬃcient way to monitor network quality, limited geographically location
of problems is possible, it allows centralized data collection, it can be used to monitor trends,
locating problems on a per-cell level is possible, etc.
Measurements related to the RAN can be classiﬁed into the following types:
• Traﬃc measurements: they are related to SDCCH, TCH, etc.
• Resource availability measurements: availability of TCHs and SDCCHs, congestion
time of TCHs and SDCCHs, average and peak number of busy TCHs and SDCCHs, etc.
• Resource Access measurements: number of messages sent in Abis interface, average
load of control channels, etc.
• Handover measurements: number of successful/unsuccessful HOs, HOs per cause, etc.
• Quality measurements: number of radio measurements in the UL or DL path with
quality in a certain range.
For practical purposes, several counters are usually combined to provide a meaningful per-
formance measure. This is the reason why Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are deﬁned by
network manufacturers in order to allow more eﬃcient performance monitoring (see Section
4.4). KPIs are calculated using formulas for the counters in the NMS. Typically, KPIs describe
the success/failure rates of the most important events such as handovers or dropped calls. An
example of KPI is the percentage of handovers due to bad quality in the DL path, which can be
calculated based on individual counters as:
DL Qual HO = sum(HODL ql)
sum(HO)
(2.1)
where HODL ql is the number of HOs in a measurement period (i.e. an hour) due to bad quality
in the DL and HO es the total number of HOs in an hour. The sum was deﬁned over all the
hours of a day, so that KPIs are obtained per day.
Quality can be measured by means of diﬀerent KPIs:
• Mean Opinion Score (MOS): MOS values range from 1 (bad) to 5 (excellent). In
order to calculate MOS, a group of listeners should evaluate the perceived subjective voice
quality under diﬀerent conditions.

CHAPTER 2. AUTOMATION AND OPTIMIZATION IN CELLULAR NETWORKS
• Bit Error Rate (BER): BER measures the raw bit error rate in reception before the
decoding process takes place. In GSM, BER is mapped into bands (i.e. RXQUAL, see
Chapter 4).
• Frame Erasure Rate (FER): FER is highly correlated with the voice quality perceived
by an user. FER represents the percentage of frames being dropped because the receiver is
unable to correct bit errors in the most important part of the speech frame. The traditional
problem associated with the usage of FER in GSM systems has been the lack of FER
measurements in the NMS, although very recently operators have started to include them
in their statistics.
• Dropped Call Rate (DCR): DCR measures the percentage of lost connections. This
KPI is very important because a dropped call has a very negative impact on the quality
of service perceived by the end user. There are diﬀerent ways to calculate DCR: dropped
calls per erlangs, dropped calls over originated calls, dropped calls over all calls handled
by each cell, including incoming handovers, etc.
• Call Setup Success Rate (CSR): CSR measures the success rate of the signalling
process related to setting up a call.
Apart from KPIs, alarms are generated at several points of the network to indicate a failure.
Subsequently, they are transmitted and stored in the NMS. Although alarms are symptoms of
malfunctioning, they do not necessarily point to the exact cause of the problems. This is due to
two main reasons. Firstly, a single fault normally triggers more than 100 alarms that are often
diﬃcult to interpret. Secondly, a single alarm may be a manifestation of multiple faults or even
be triggered in the absence of a fault.

Automation and optimization
The coming years will bring profound changes to the mobile telecommunications industry [195].
Those changes are due to the new services oﬀered by mobile operators, the introduction of new
air interface technologies and the increased level of competition. It is foreseen that in the future,
mobile phones will be the preferred choice for connecting to the Internet. This change is driven
by the desire of the end users to have Internet access at any time regardless of their location.
To enable the convergence of mobile systems with the Internet, new functionalities will have
to be integrated into existing cellular systems.
For GSM operators, this has meant adding
GPRS related hardware and software to existing networks. Similarly, the core / transmission
network will have to be upgraded to facilitate data throughput for the new services. In parallel,
operators are deploying UMTS networks in order to enable new services that require even higher
data rates.
MENÚ

The addition of new technology increases the complexity of operating the network. When
speech telephony was the only service oﬀered, indicators such as DCR, speech quality and
blocking of call attempts were suitable indicators to give operators an understanding about the
performance of the network. With the addition of the packet-switched service, new performance
indicators such as data transfer speed, delay or availability are required. Thus, the increased
complexity of the network makes its analysis and tuning processes far more diﬃcult.
The huge fees operators had to pay for UMTS licences have increased their debt burden
signiﬁcantly. In addition, further investment is needed to purchase the UMTS equipment and
ﬁnance its installation. Consequently, operators are under increasing ﬁnancial pressure to pro-
duce returns on their investments. At the same time new 3G operators have been admitted into
several markets hence further increasing competition in the mobile industry.
These changes of the network go along with a continuous network roll out even in rela-
tively mature cellular markets. The deployment of additional sites is mainly required to provide
increased levels of in-building coverage as mobile users expect to be oﬀered service in all geo-
graphical locations. In addition, network growth is also needed to enhance system capacity in
order to cater for the rapid increase in the level of packet-switched traﬃc.
In the past, operators managed to cope with rapid technological changes and growth of the
network by increasing their workforce. However, due to the ﬁnancial pressures this is not a
viable strategy anymore. Therefore, the only feasible option to maintain network quality with
the existing workforce whilst also integrating new technology into the network is to increase
the level of automation. This will free resources, which can tackle upcoming challenges brought
about by the continuing evolution of the network.
Areas that require automation to oﬀer a cost-eﬀective implementation are those involving
heavy calculations and/or the evaluation of several input parameters. In contrast to humans,
computers can easily carry out analysis of complicated input data. In addition, computers are
able to repeat a method many times and thus enable the application of the method to all cells
in the network. The beneﬁt of automation to these kinds of tasks is an increase in network
performance since without the application of automation these tasks could not be carried out on
a wide scale, i.e. a large number of cells. Automation can also be applied to existing tasks, e.g.
frequency planning. In this case, one positive side eﬀect of increasing the level of automation is
that the staﬀis freed from mundane and tedious tasks and can apply their skills in new areas,
which bring additional value to the operator. In this sense, automation assures that the staﬀis
working on challenging tasks, which in turn helps to motivate and retain staﬀ.
Operational eﬃciency is related to the work-eﬀort that is required to provide a given spectral
eﬃciency10 at a given grade of service, which is crucial in providing cost-eﬃcient data transfer.
Several factors have inﬂuence on operational eﬃciency, such as the salary of the employees. For
example, if a given feature enables an increase of spectral eﬃciency by 10%, but the related
work-eﬀort has to be increased by 50% to enable this improvement, then it is doubtful that the
overall data transfer cost can be reduced by this feature.
10The spectral eﬃciency is a measure of how eﬀectively a system makes use of a limited amount of spectrum.
It can be deﬁned as the delivered bits per second per Hz of occupied bandwidth

Automation helps to increase operational eﬃciency, while also increasing network perfor-
mance. Thus, it is possible to obtain better performance from the existing network at a lower
cost. Although the technical focus on this thesis is on RAN in GSM, the trend of increasing
automation in cellular systems is also applicable to 3G networks.
Fig.2.3 displays several technical factors contributing to the performance of the RAN of a
GSM network and their interdependence.
The foundation of a well-performing network is the basic radio platform. Issues such
as the location of the sites as well as positioning of antennas [196] have a major impact on
the distribution of the radio signal and, thus, on call quality. For example, the closer sites are
located near a traﬃc hot spot because the easier it is to provide good call quality with low signal
levels, hence reducing interference to surrounding cells.
In addition, the clearance of faults, called troubleshooting (TS), is also very important in
order to ensure that the network operates exactly as designed [39, 43]. If a cell is temporarily
non-operational, the performance of all cells in the vicinity is impaired. Ensuring that this cell is
speedily brought back into operation is a crucial task to ensure optimum network performance.
The adjacency plan11 is one of the major contributors to network quality. HO to most
suitable cells will be possible only with the deﬁnition of correct adjacencies. On the contrary,
without the deﬁnition of the optimum adjacencies, HOs occur to cells that are suboptimal
in terms of their radio link performance and subsequently dropping of calls is very probable.
Automating the process of updating adjacency deﬁnitions by deleting under-used ones and
11For handovers (HOs) to occur between a pair of cells, the target cell has to be deﬁned as an adjacency at the
source cell. If an adjacency is not deﬁned, a HO cannot take place even if both cells are very close in propagation
terms. The adjacency plan is the list of adjacencies deﬁned for each cell in the network.

creating missing ones [186] will enhance operational eﬃciency and, depending on the quality of
the existing adjacency management process, also increase network performance.
Similarly, a good frequency plan12 is of paramount importance for network performance.
The better the frequency plan, the less co- and adjacent-channel interference is experienced by
subscribers. This means better call quality and subsequently smaller DCR. Thus, automation
may help to improve the frequency plan and the work-eﬀort associated with its creation, i.e.
enhancing operational eﬃciency [38, 194].
Another important factor that determines network quality is parameterizations of net-
work features.
Traditionally, standard parameters have been used network wide, but this
solution is not optimal when trying to enhance network performance. Each cell operates under
unique conditions and requires customization of parameter values to provide optimum per-
formance. In this context, automation is a very useful tool to increase operational eﬃciency
[185, 195, 125].
Automation can be applied to the tasks indicated in Fig.2.3 in order to enhance network
performance while reducing the manpower required to carry out the task. It is worth noting that
information to tune the network is provided for free, since most of it is made of measurement
reports that ordinary subscribers are providing free of charge in call mode. More information
about automation and optimization can be found in [134, 135, 113, 177, 90, 125].
2.2.2
Troubleshooting in current cellular networks
As networks evolve and they increase in size, complexity and heterogeneity, the need for advanced
fault management capabilities becomes critical. The RAN of cellular systems is no exception.
Fault management, also called troubleshooting, includes the detection, isolation and correction
of faults, where a fault is a cause of malfunctioning.
As described in Chapter 1, currently, in most cellular networks, TS is a manual process car-
ried out by experts in the RAN. This TS process is characterised by eliminating likely problem
causes in order to single out the actual one. During the procedure, several applications and
databases have to be queried to analyze performance indicators, cell conﬁgurations and alarms.
The speed of identifying faults is dependent on the level of expertise of the troubleshooter, the
type of information available and the quality of the tools displaying relevant pieces of infor-
mation. This means that, in addition to a good understanding of the possible causes of the
problems, a very good understanding of the tools available to access the sources of information
is also required. Due to the complexity of the management system, it is almost impossible for
newcomers to perform TS in a proﬁcient manner. Therefore, some of the most experienced
members of staﬀare involved in rectifying problems in the network rather than looking after its
further development. In addition, normally the experience on how to identify problems is kept
“secret”, every expert follows his own rule of thumb and if he leaves the company, his experi-
ence is lost. Furthermore, the growing size of cellular networks, together with their increasing
complexity, make it very diﬃcult for humans to analyze the vast amount of information coming

from the network. Consequently, several operators consider TS as one of the most time and
resource consuming tasks associated with the operation of the network. When downtime of cells
is long, it unavoidably translates into lost of revenues for the operator. Thus, operators aim to
limit the occurrence of faults as well as their duration.
Troubleshooting phases
TS in a cellular network consists of the following phases (Fig.2.4):
1. Fault detection: malfunctioning cells should be identiﬁed based on the values of KPIs
and alarms (e.g. isolating cells with a high number of dropped calls).
2. Diagnosis: the cause of the problems (e.g. interference) should be identiﬁed based on
KPIs, alarms and conﬁguration data.
3. Fault recovery: some actions should be carried out in order to solve the problems (e.g.
improving the frequency plan).
This thesis is focused on diagnosis, which is by far the most diﬃcult and thus time-consuming
task within the TS activity.
Operational Scenario
Currently, troubleshooting is mainly a manual process carried out by diﬀerent teams. Each
network operator follows its own approach, although Fig.2.5 is in line with TS in most networks.
TS is normally related to a Trouble ticket (TT) system. When a fault is investigated, a TT
reﬂects the problem status, that is the fault description and the steps performed so far to solve
it out or the identiﬁcation of the faulty equipment in case the problem is deemed as a HW fault.
A TT system is deployed as a large database, which can be queried by the user, using criteria
MENÚ
SALIR

2.2. STATE OF THE ART
27
like time constraints or identiﬁers (ID), such as cell ID and site ID. After a query, all the cases
related to the speciﬁed cell within the given time period are shown. The entries are normally in
“free text”, almost like a “virtual log-book” that everyone uses to annotate the actions taken and
observations made for the cell. Hence, in diﬃcult cases lots of people from various departments
have looked into the cell and potentially applied some changes. For example a case might involve
changing parameters, swapping HW, re-tuning the cell, taking more measurements, re-tuning
neighbouring cells, etc. Thus, several notes are normally written to such a case.
TS procedure may involve several layers, depending on the complexity of the case. The
Front Oﬃce group (FOG) is the ﬁrst such layer.
This team is responsible for dealing with
alarms generated by the network.
Typically, the number of triggered alarms may be up to
100000 per week for the whole network. Alarm reduction technique reduces this large number
of alarms so that the FOG are presented with the important alarms, leaving about 600 alarms
per week. Then, FOG raises TTs, i.e. reports related to those alarms. In addition, FOG carries
out a preliminary analysis to identify the cause of the problem. Sometimes this group solves
the problem. In that case, they update the TT with a description of the performed actions
and “close the TT”. In more complex cases, they send the TT to the second layer for further
investigation, including in the TT a description of the steps that were carried out.
The second TS layer is the Back Oﬃce group (BOG), which looks into faults based mainly on
short-term statistics. BOG staﬀpursue a deeper analysis to identify the cause of the problem and
they update the TT with the executed actions. If, as a consequence, the problem is solved, they
close the TT. If they are not able to solve the problem, they reassign the TT to a more specialized
group, the Technical Support group (TSG). This new group may be composed of troubleshooting
experts of the operator itself or external experts, e.g. from a equipment manufacturer.
Therefore, TSG is the subsequent layer in the procedure. This team often uses scripts to
generate a list of “worst performing cells” (i.e. they use fault detection tools) and takes this as
a starting point for their work, focusing on the most serious cases. Then, they look further into
TTs raised by FOG and BOG and raise new TTs with the results of their analysis. They can
solve parameter related problems, but they often need to involve ﬁeld engineers for problems
related to HW on the site. Field engineers travel to the BTS sites and ﬁx HW problems or
any other problem requiring on-site personnel. Each day the ﬁeld engineers receive a new plan
containing the list of sites they have to visit and the cases they have to investigate on site. If
the problem is solved at the site, TSG closes the TT.
Finally, a minor part of TTs are raised by the Customer Faults group (CFG) who may
receive customer complaints from call centers, management, engineering staﬀ, etc. They can
either solve the problem themselves or send the TT to a more adequate group.
Trouble ticket systems are commonly used in telecommunication networks to assist in fault
management [136, 139, 138]. Thus, TS begins with the documentation of a trouble in a TT.
Subsequently, the trouble ticket system receives as inputs the reports generated by the diﬀerent
teams in Fig.2.5. Management of these reports implies the assignment of the tickets at each
moment to the most adequate team to deal with it. The trouble ticket may pass through several
hands and undergo diﬀerent degrees of escalation with respect to priority until it is closed, i.e.

Visualization tools
As explained above, in current cellular networks, diagnosis is carried out manually by experts
with a lot of experience in the problem ﬁeld. In such a case, the most informative portion of the
measurement data should be represented in an eﬃcient form in order to successfully exploit the
expert knowledge. Hence, cellular network operators have visualization tools which are used for
conﬁguration, fault and performance management. The user can either analyze some predeﬁned
KPIs or he can specify new formulas to calculate KPIs from counters in the NMS. Those tools
allow not only the observation of some instantaneous values of KPIs, but they also show the
temporal evolution of KPIs, which is very useful in trend analysis. In addition, it is possible to
deﬁne thresholds for KPIs in order to detect abnormal behaviors of network elements. Three
types of reports are normally used: alarms, network conﬁguration or measurements.
Experts in diagnosis use those visualization tools in order to identify faults. On the one hand,
these experts can observe the main alarms. Alarms are graphically displayed on the screen in
such a way that it is easy to identify the element that triggered the alarms in the ﬁrst place. On
the other hand, several KPIs related to the same fault can be represented together on the same
chart. Experts analyze trends and abnormal behaviors of KPIs. Trends are useful to perform
proactive fault management, that is identifying and solving a future fault before it becomes
a real problem. Abnormal behaviors are sudden changes of KPIs, which indicate that a fault
started at certain moment in time. In such case, reactive TS is crucial for performing fast fault
identiﬁcation and recovery so that network downtime is minimised.
Fig.2.6 shows some examples of the type of displayed information, which is analyzed by
experts in order to diagnose a fault.
In the ﬁgure some charts related to traﬃc channels,
handovers due to bad quality and received signal quality in the downlink and uplink paths are
depicted. From the graphics, it can be concluded that from April 30th there was a problem
related to the uplink path.
Sometimes, operators have a kind of recipe describing the KPIs that should be observed
in order to identify a certain fault. Instructions may come in the shape of a ﬂowchart. For
example, if the number of level handovers is high, then the following step proposed by the
ﬂowchart could be to check the received signal level. In other case, the signal quality should
be analyzed. Nevertheless, more often troubleshooting experts follow no written guidelines, but
their own diagnosis rules, which are based on their experience of working in this ﬁeld.
2.2.3
Automatic troubleshooting
As described in Chapter 1, automating TS has several beneﬁts. Firstly, the time required to
locate the reason for a fault causing a problem is greatly reduced. Thus, the downtime and the
time with reduced quality of service (QoS) is limited signiﬁcantly. Secondly, fewer personnel
and, thus, fewer operational costs are necessary to maintain a network of a given size at a given
performance. Thirdly, the TS process is de-skilled as the majority of problems can be rectiﬁed

with the help of the automated TS tool. Finally, one additional beneﬁt is that the TS knowledge
can be stored in the TS tool, therefore not being dependent on staﬀavailability. Thereby, the
gains achieved thanks to automated TS for an operator are signiﬁcant as fewer personnel with a
lower skill level can solve more network problems in less time. In the following section, a scheme
to perform automatic TS will be proposed.
Decision-theoretic troubleshooting
Sometimes, fault identiﬁcation is an iterative process: if after executing a speciﬁc action the
problem is not solved, the analysis to identify the fault is repeated taking into account that the
erroneous cause is discarded from the analysis. This is related to decision-theoretic troubleshoot-
ing [96, 51, 189, 111, 110], which considers that the aim of TS is to solve the problems, not just
determining the cause.
At any stage of the TS process, there are many possible pieces of evidence or tests (obser-
vations), and repairs (actions) that can be collected or applied, respectively. Because these
operations are expensive in terms of time and money, it is desirable to generate a sequence of
steps (observations or actions) that, whilst minimising costs, results in a functioning network.
A very simple TS procedure collects all observations. Then, it makes reasoning based on the
observations, ranking the possible causes according to their probabilities, and it performs the
repair action associated with the most probable cause. If after executing this repair action, it is
observed that the most probable cause was not the actual cause, the repair action associated to
MENÚ
SALIR

2.2. STATE OF THE ART
31
the following cause in the list of ranked causes is carried out. This is not an optimum procedure
because all observations are collected, when probably not all of them are required to ﬁnd out the
cause. This is specially important in the medical domain, where some tests may be expensive
and invasive for the patient. Furthermore, sometimes it could be more eﬃcient to perform an
action diﬀerent to the one associated to the most probable cause. For example, suppose that
the most probable cause was a hardware fault. In that case, it is probably more cost-eﬃcient
to make a simple parameter change to check whether the problem was a conﬁguration problem
than replacing the faulty HW unit. Only if the parameter change fails to solve the problem,
someone will be send to the site to change the problematic HW unit, which is always a very
expensive and time-consuming action.
An optimum procedure would order the steps (observations and actions) in a sequence min-
imising the cost (money and time). The actions would be ranked according to their eﬃciency,
where the eﬃciency of an action is deﬁned as the ratio between the probability of the action
solving the problem and the cost of that action. At each moment, a greedy algorithm would
calculate the expected cost of the sequence of steps carried out up to the moment together with
each new candidate observation and action. The chosen step would be the one with the lowest
expected cost.
Following this algorithm, in general, some actions will be carried out before
collecting all observations and very probably the problem will be solved by one of these actions,
saving time and money. For example, if after collecting some observations, the probabilities of
faulty HW and bad conﬁguration are very high, a parameter change will be proposed by the
algorithm and if the problem is solved, it will not be required to collect the other observations
or perform the other actions.
In the problem under study in this thesis, it has been considered that all observations (per-
formance indicators, alarms and conﬁguration data) are available in the NMS and the cost of
collecting them is negligible. In future work, the time saving of using only some of the observa-
tions could be quantiﬁed. In addition, out of the three TS tasks in Fig.2.4, diagnosis is the most
diﬃcult and time consuming and no information about it can be found in present literature.
Hence, this thesis is focused on diagnosis. It is supposed that there is a Fault Detection module
which identiﬁes the problematic cells prior to diagnosis. Under these assumptions13, the optimal
repair sequence for a faulty cell is given by the following algorithm:
1. Collect all available observations for the cell under study
2. Given that the cell is malfunctioning, compute the probabilities of the causes
3. Execute the (as yet non executed) action Ai with the highest eﬃciency ϵ(Ai|E):
ϵ(Ai|E) = P(Ai = yes|E)
CAi(E)
(2.2)
where P(Ai = yes|E) is the probability of the action Ai solving the problem given the
evidence compiled so far and the result of previous actions, E, and CAi(E) is the cost of

CHAPTER 2. AUTOMATION AND OPTIMIZATION IN CELLULAR NETWORKS
performing the action Ai, which may depends on E. It is assumed that linked to each
cause Ci there is a unique action Ai which solves the problem. Hence, P(Ai = yes|E) is
also the probability of the cause Ci.
4. If the action solved the problem, then terminate. Otherwise, go to step 2.
In this algorithm, the required information are the posterior probabilities of the causes given
evidence and the costs of the related actions. The costs can be easily provided by operators of

Interfaces of the automatic troubleshooting system
In this thesis, the expert system which performs automatic diagnosis and proposition of healing
actions will be denoted Diagnosis and Recovery tool (DAR). However, it should be understood
that troubleshooting has a wider meaning because it is composed of fault detection, diagnosis
and fault recovery, as described in Fig.2.4. The tool that pursues all those tasks will be denoted
Troubleshooting tool (TST).
Fig.2.7 shows the interfaces of the DAR. The Fault Detection subsystem provides the DAR
with the list of faulty cells to be diagnosed.
DAR requires a diagnosis model on which its
reasoning mechanisms are based. The subsystem named model deﬁnition is in charge of building
the diagnosis model to be used by the DAR. Diagnosis models can be built based either on
the expertise of human troubleshooters or on statistics from the network. Those statistics are
normally saved in the NMS. The inputs to the DAR are conﬁguration parameters, alarms and
KPIs for each of the faulty cells. The NMS contains historical databases containing the values
of all those inputs. In addition, DAR may also require some inputs directly requested to the
user, which may be related to observations that are not in the NMS, e.g. whether the day was
rainy on the day the fault occurred. The output of the DAR is a diagnosis on the fault that is
causing the problems in each malfunctioning cell. In addition, DAR proposes a list of actions,
ranked by their eﬃciency, to be sequentially executed until the problem is solved. These actions
may be just changing a conﬁguration parameter from a remote terminal or may involve sending
personnel to a site to replace a faulty piece of equipment. A TST may even execute software
related repair actions. Although, normally, operators prefer that the TST only proposes the
actions, but the ﬁnal decision be handled by a human expert (the TST in this case acts as a so
called decision support system). Finally, DAR is also intended to generate a report about the
diagnosed cause and the steps carried out in order to recover from the fault (trouble ticket).
The TST can work independently from the NMS, but most of the beneﬁts of automated TS
are achieved when it is an integrated part of it. This integrated solution will provide direct access
to information required in fault analysis as well as access to the operators’s fault management
system. An integrated solution is also beneﬁcial in case of TS of multi-vendor networks and of
multi-system networks (GSM, UMTS, WLAN). The TS expert system is system independent,
thus, with minor modiﬁcations multi-vendor and multi-system networks can be supported. The

integration in the NMS guarantees that the TST is whole synchronised with the whole fault
management system. Hence, all relevant TS cases can be automatically directed to the TST
and if it ﬁnds the solution, the case is cleared, reported and ﬁled. If the problem is not found
by the expert system, it can be redirected to the specialists for further analysis and the ﬁnal
conclusions can be incorporated into the knowledge of the expert system.
First steps in automation of troubleshooting
Preliminary studies related to automatic troubleshooting have been focused on methods to
achieve eﬃcient visualization of the network performance. Thanks to those visualization tools,
anomaly detection is carried out more easily. For example, in [132] a method to analyze network
performance based on knowledge and standard quadratic programming techniques is presented.
The basic idea of the method is to measure performance in terms of the number of failed
operations in the network. Thus, KPIs are divided into sets describing the performance of the
subsystems of the GSM network. Simple mathematical models are proposed for each subsystem,
which depend on the KPIs.
The model parameters are estimated from training data using
quadratic programming. After the model is estimated, a graph may be constructed in order to
analyze the dependencies between the subsystems and the KPIs.
Several studies have been carried in the ﬁeld of Fault Detection, which is the ﬁrst step in
TS, as shown in Fig.2.4. Most methods consist in building models for the normal behavior of
the system. The deviations of the available measurement variables from the normal behavior
can then be detected with some type of abnormality detector.
Hence, in [123, 124, 104, 133] the proposed method for FD is based on a Self-Organizing
Map (SOM), which is one of the most popular neural network14 algorithms due to its eﬃcient
visualization properties.
A behavior pattern of a cell is a set of KPIs.
SOM maps a high-
dimensional behavior patter onto a low-dimensional, usually two-dimensional grid. In network
analysis, SOM can be used to ﬁnd and show similarities between behavior patterns of cells.
Thus, when SOM is visualized, similarly behaving cells can be spotted close to each other. In
these papers, clustering, that is grouping of similar behaving cells, uses a combination of SOM
and an algorithm called k-means. Cell clusters that have been found by the proposed methods
can be used to identify cells that have a certain defect, e.g. by calculating the distance between
a new input vector to the normal proﬁle.
In [48, 47], a method for FD in 3G cellular networks is proposed. A neural network is trained
using an algorithm called Winner-Take-All, in which only the weight of a single neuron is changed
with each new input vector. The neural network is trained with vectors of KPIs collected during
normal functioning of the cellular network, i.e.
no examples of abnormal features are used
for training. Using percentiles of the normality proﬁle, a numerical interval representing normal
behavior of the system is deﬁned. FD is carried out in the following way: the deﬁned interval for
normal behavior is used to classify a new vector into normal/abnormal by means of hypothesis

testing. Furthermore, in these papers, the method is extended to identify anomalous attributes.
Thus, conﬁdence intervals for the normal behavior of each KPI are calculated. Each new KPI
value is compared with the normal behavior and, if it is not within the range deﬁned for the
normal interval, then it is considered abnormal. The assertion of a KPI being abnormal may be
taken as input for a more complex diagnosis system where symptoms have been discretized into
two states: normal / abnormal.
Regarding automatic diagnosis, up to our knowledge, no references can be found about diag-
nosis in the RAN of cellular networks. However, automatic diagnosis has been extensively studied
in other ﬁelds, such as diagnosis of diseases in medicine [34, 146, 99, 199, 35, 154, 147, 144],
troubleshooting of printer failures [96, 51, 100, 94, 98, 101, 174, 111, 175, 173], diagnosis of
faults in satellite communication systems [107, 131, 44, 57], etc. Fault identiﬁcation in the core
of communication networks has also received considerable attention [115, 182, 190, 73, 183]. In
that scenario, it is very important to represent the dependencies among communication system
entities because a failure in an entity may have a large impact on other system entities. Further-
more, in general, the only type of symptoms are the alarms related to the network entities. In
the RAN of cellular systems, the previous formulation is not valid, because of two main reasons.
Firstly, most faults are not related to a physical component, but to a poor network planning
or an incorrect parameter setting. Thus, modelling the interactions among entities is not a re-
quirement like in other communication networks. Secondly, although alarms are very important
to identify faults in speciﬁc pieces of equipment, they do not provide conclusive information in
order to isolate more general problems, such as radio frequency interference or lack of cover-
age. In this scenario, performance indicators are crucial to identify the fault. Furthermore, the
fact that performance indicators are continuous, instead of binary like alarms, introduces a new
diﬃculty in the modelling which is nonexistent in the case of other communication networks.
As described in Section 2.2.2, in current cellular networks, diagnosis in the RAN is still a
manual process, although very recently research studies in automation have been initiated. Ref-
erences in this area are focused on alarm correlation. In [84, 88], model-based alarm correlation
methods are presented. These approaches use a model of each device formulated as a set of
formulas. For example, a certain device is considered to generate a malfunctioning alarm if a
speciﬁc set of low-level alarms are present. In [193, 192], a neural network based alarm correla-
tion system is proposed. On the one hand, each generated alarm is represented as a neuron at
the input layer. On the other hand, each ﬁltered alarm is represented as a neuron in the output
layer. During training, the weights in the neural network are adapted.
Although alarm correlation can be considered a ﬁrst step in the diagnosis of faults, alarms
do not provide conclusive information to identify the cause of problems, especially if the possible
causes are not only faults in pieces of equipment. Even after alarm correlation, the number of
triggered alarms for a single cause is normally very high. In addition, the same alarm can be
triggered by diﬀerent causes. Because of these reasons, it is impossible to identify all fault causes
based only on alarms. Faults, such as interference or lack of coverage are diﬃcult to identify if
performance indicators are also not considered.
This thesis is focused on automatic diagnosis based on performance indicators because it has

not been previously addressed in the existing literature and because it is the main part of the
current TS process applied by operators around the world. Nevertheless, an eﬃcient diagnosis
system should consider not only performance indicators, but also alarms.

Diagnosis techniques
The ﬁrst part of this chapter summarizes some techniques which may be used to model uncer-
tainty in reasoning. The second part of the chapter is devoted to the principles of BNs, which
in this thesis, have been the selected method amongst the previously described ones.
3.1
Reasoning under uncertainty
3.1.1
Introduction
Uncertainty is always intrinsically joined to diagnosis. When an expert asserts which was the
cause of problems in a cellular network, he/she is never completely sure about his diagnosis.
There are diﬀerent sources of uncertainty. Firstly, the data could be unreliable. For example,
a measuring equipment may be defective. Secondly, the data may be incomplete. For example,
information about only some of the symptoms may be available.
Finally, the data may be
only approximately known. For example, a signal level may be measured with a limited degree
of precision. Furthermore, not only might the data be imprecise, but so might be the rules
for drawing conclusions. That is, the knowledge is not deterministic. For example, the same
symptoms may be related to diﬀerent causes. Therefore, diagnosis requires a means for reasoning
with uncertainty.
Diﬀerent approaches to model uncertainty can be found in artiﬁcial intelligence bibliography,
which will be brieﬂy summarized in the following sections [181, 166]. Most techniques use the
theory of probability to deal with uncertainty. In the literature, a philosophical debate about
the meaning and interpretation of probabilities can be found. There is a distinction between
objective probability, which is linked to the convergence of a relative frequency of an experiment,
and subjective probability, also called degree of belief , which is an individual’s subjective estimate
of the certainty of an event. For example, the experiment of tossing a coin could be repeated
many times and the “objective” probability of any of the outcomes would be the limit, as the
number of trials approach inﬁnity, of the relative frequency of that outcome. However, if a
person has to bet that A will be the winning team on a given upcoming football game, the
probability would be “subjective” because the game cannot be repeated many times under the
37

exact same conditions.
It should be pointed out, that a fact is either true or false (i.e. either team A will win or
not). Thus, the degree of belief is diﬀerent to the degree of vagueness, which is used to deﬁne
concepts that imply vagueness. For example, Maria is 0.7 tall would indicate the degree (from
0 to 1) in which Maria is tall.
3.1.2
Certainty factors
Certainty factors (CFs) were used to develop MYCIN [172]. The MYCIN system, which aimed
at diagnosing and recommending treatment for certain blood infections, was created at Stanford
in the 1970s. In this system, the model was composed of facts and rules1. CFs linked degrees of
belief to those facts and rules. On the one hand, the CF associated with a hypothesis2 stands
for the degree of belief in that hypothesis, given all the evidence that has been used so far. On
the other hand, the CF linked to a rule indicates the degree of belief in the conclusion following
from the rule’s premise. The CF is explained in terms of a subjective belief in a hypothesis and,
thus, it ranges from 0 to 1. An example of rule is the following:
IF the received signal level is low
and the received signal quality is bad
and the average timing advance is high
THEN the cause of the high dropped call rate is a lack of coverage (0.8)
This rule states that if the conditions about signal level, signal quality and timing advance
are met, then we can be 0.8 certain about the cause of the problem, i.e. the probability of lack
of coverage is 0.8.
Some schemes have been developed to combine the CFs of diﬀerent hypothesis and rules [52].
However, in [92], it was demonstrated that, when combining diﬀerent rules, CFs could provide
incorrect degrees of belief, due to the unavoidable inconsistencies of any model with many rules.
3.1.3
Dempster-Shafer theory
The Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory [72, 169] is a mathematical theory of evidence3, which distin-
guishes between lack of belief and disbelief. For example, let A represent the proposition “Maria
is tall”. Then, according to the axioms of probabilities4 P(A) + P(−A) = 1. But if we do not
even know who Maria is, we cannot say that we believe or not believe the proposition. It would
therefore be meaningful to denote our belief of A, B(A), and of −A, B(−A), as both being
0. The main advantage of D-S approach over other techniques is its ability to admit partially
speciﬁed models.
1Rules are IF-THEN assertions
2hypothesis are facts that are not observable or only observable at an unacceptable cost
3Evidence is the assignment of values to variables

First, a complete set of elements should be deﬁned, which is called the frame of discernment
and it is denoted by θ. The elements in θ are mutually exclusive. For example, in diagnosis
applications, θ would be the set consisting of all the possible faults or diseases. The set of subsets
of θ is denoted by 2θ. For example, if θ is the set {A (interference), B (lack of coverage), C
(hardware fault)}, then 2θ is the set {∅, {A}, {B}, {C}, {A, B}, {A, C}, {B, C}, {A, B, C}}. The
D-S approach uses a number between 0 and 1 to indicate a degree of belief. In this way, there is
an assignment function, M, called basic probability assignment, which assigns a number [0, 1] to
every subset in 2θ. Furthermore, M is such that the sum of assignments over all subsets is 1, i.e.
P
∀x∈2θ M(x) = 1. M(θ) is a measure of the total belief that is not assigned to any subset of θ. For
example, let θ = {A (interference), B (lack of coverage), C (hardware fault), D (transmission
fault)} be possible causes of the high dropped call rate in a cell. Suppose that we know that
the cause is not lack of coverage to the degree 0.4. Then, we would assign M({A,C,D}) = 0.4,
M(θ) = 0.6 and M(x) = 0 to the rest of subsets in 2θ.
From the basic probability assignment, the D-S approach deﬁnes three other measures:
• The belief function Bel(z), which assigns to every subset z of 2θ the total belief assigned
by M to z plus the belief assigned to all of its subsets, that is, Bel(z) = P
x⊆z
M(x)
• The measure of doubt, D(z) =Bel(−z), where −z is the complementary set of z.
• The measure of plausibility, Pl(z) = 1−D(z). This measure is also called the upper belief
function or the upper probability function.
Bel(H) gives the total amount of belief committed to hypothesis H based on the available
evidence, and D(H) gives the amount of belief committed to its negation. Pl(H) expresses how
much we should believe in H if all currently unknown facts were to support H. D-S theory also
deﬁnes how to combine degrees of belief using Dempster’s rule.
Example. Let’s assume θ = {A, B, C}, M(A) = 0.3, M(A, B) = 0.2 and M(A, B, C) = 0.5.
Then, Bel({A})=0.3, Bel({A, B})=0.5, Bel({A, C})=0.3, Bel({A, B, C})=1 and Bel({B})=0.
Consequently, Pl({A})=1, Pl({A, B})=1, Pl({A, C})=1, Pl({A, B, C})=1 and Pl({B})=0.7.
3.1.4
Fuzzy logic
In the previously described approaches, certainty was referring to the degree of belief in some-
thing. For example, the sentence “I believe (0.8) it will rain tomorrow” does not mean that we
expect 80% of rain. Either it will rain or it will not. Uncertainty refers to the probability of
rain, that is the degree with which we believe it will rain versus the degree with which we belief
it will not rain.
Fuzziness, which is a concept diﬀerent to uncertainty, is related with vagueness. For example,
let’s consider a day in which it rains a few times during the day. Then, we could say that the day
is rainy to some degree. Hence, fuzziness allows to deﬁne concepts that imply vagueness. It has
nothing to do with degree of belief in something and does not have to be related to probabilities.

Figure 3.1: Characteristic function for a fuzzy set representing “high received signal level”
Formal theory about fuzzyness was ﬁrst published in 1965 [205]. Since then, fuzzy set theory
has been a burning ﬁeld in mathematics and artiﬁcial intelligence. Fuzzy set theory is based on
the idea of gradual membership in a set.
A fuzzy set A is characterized by a membership function, also called characteristic function,
µA, which assigns each point x a real number in the interval [0,1], representing the degree or
grade of membership of x in A.
For example, Fig.3.1 shows a membership function which
determines whether the average received signal level would be considered high. According to
that function, any value under -110 dBm is not high (µA = 0), whereas a value over -80 dBm
is deﬁnitively high (µA = 1). Received signal level whose value falls between these extremes are
considered high to an intermediate degree. A variable like “level” is called a fuzzy variable, and
it can take on values like “high”, “medium” or “low”. That is, a fuzzy variable takes on a fuzzy
set as a value.
Fuzzy sets and characteristic functions may be used in two ways. Firstly, they can be used
to estimate degrees of membership. For example, suppose we measure that the received signal
level is -95 dBm and we want to determine the degree to which this measurement is a “high
value”. A speciﬁc value like “-95 dBm” is called a crisp value. According to the characteristic
function in Fig.3.1, we would say that the degree of membership is 0.5. Secondly, fuzzy sets can
be used to express possibilities in situations where we have incomplete information. Suppose we
are told that the received signal level is high but we do not know its exact value. In that case,
the characteristic function is Fig.3.1 can be used to express preferences on possible values of a
variable whose exact value is not known. This interpretation of fuzzy sets is called possibility
distribution.
Operations on fuzzy sets are deﬁned in a similar manner as operations on ordinary sets.
Operators such as complement, union and intersection are applied to the characteristic functions
[65]. For example, the complement of a fuzzy set is the set whose characteristic function is 1
minus the original set’s characteristic function at each point. The union operation takes the
maximum of the characteristic functions of two sets, whereas the intersection takes the minimum.

A fuzzy relation is a fuzzy set deﬁned over a cross-product5. A fuzzy relation is represented
by a characteristic function that associates a grade of membership with each element of the
cross-product.
A fuzzy proposition is a statement that asserts a value for a fuzzy variable, e.g. “the received
signal level is low”. In this case, “the received signal level” is the fuzzy variable and “low” is
the value for that variable, which is a fuzzy set.
A fuzzy rule relates two or more fuzzy propositions. Fuzzy inference must determine a belief
in a rule’s conclusion given evidence on the rule’s premise, i.e. fuzzy inference speciﬁes how to
combine the fuzzy values with the rule so as to deﬁne a new fuzzy value. There are several fuzzy
inference techniques, the most common ones being the max-min and the max-product inference.
A fuzzy rule could be the following:
IF received signal level is low
and quality is poor
THEN interference is high
After the rules have been applied, the output is a fuzzy set, called induced fuzzy set. Some-
times, for example in control systems, this fuzzy set has to be converted into a crisp value. This
process is called defuzziﬁcation. The most common methods for defuzziﬁcation are the moments
method and the centroid method.
In summary, a reasoning system based on fuzzy logic would perform the following steps.
Firstly, if the inputs to the system are crisp they must be converted into fuzzy vectors. Secondly,
fuzzy rules are applied. Evidence is combined using fuzzy set union or intersection. Finally, the
fuzzy set outputs of the system become crisp through defuzziﬁcation.
3.1.5
Probabilistic networks
A probabilistic network, also called Bayesian Network [157, 110, 54] is a pair (D, P) that allows
eﬃcient representation of a joint probability distribution over a set of random variables U =
{X1, ..., Xn}. D is a Directed Acyclic Graph6 (DAG), whose nodes correspond to the random
variables X1, ..., Xn and whose edges represent direct dependencies between the variables. An
example of the DAG corresponding to a BN is depicted in Fig.3.2. The second component, P,
is a set of conditional probability functions, one for each variable:
P = {p(X1|π1), . . . , p(Xn|πn)}
(3.1)
where πi is the parent set of Xi in U7.
5A cross-product of two sets, X ×Y , is the set containing all pairs (p, q) where p ∈X and q ∈Y . For example,
let X = {a, b} and let Y = {0, 1}. Then X × Y = {(a, 0), (a, 1), (b, 0), (b, 1)}.
6A DAG is a set of nodes and oriented edges with no paths that returns to the same node (i.e. no cycles)
7Xj is a child of Xi and Xi is a parent of Xj if there is a link from Xi to Xj. Xj is a descendent of Xi if there
exists a directed path from Xi to Xj

BNs encode the conditional independence among variables. The edges of the graph rep-
resent the assertion that, given its parents, a variable is conditionally independent of its non-
descendants in the graph. For example, in Fig.3.2, given X1, X2 is conditionally independent of
X3.
Variables may be continuous or discrete. If the variables are continuous the quantitative
part of the BN is composed of conditional probability density functions (pdfs). On the contrary,
if the variables are discrete, the quantitative part of the BN is composed of probability tables.
Evidence E = {X1 = x1, ..., Xm = xm} is an assignment of values to variables in a subset of U,
X = {X1, ..., Xm}.
Belief networks may be used to obtain the probability of certain variable Xi given the avail-
able evidence, i.e. P(Xi = xi|E). This process is called inference, evidence propagation or
probability updating.
It is known that, in general, this task is NP-hard8 [62, 66], although
eﬃcient heuristic algorithms have been developed [119, 69].
BNs will be further explained in Section 3.2.
3.1.6
Justiﬁcation of the selected technique
Amongst the techniques described in the previous sections, Bayesian Networks have been the
selected one. Up to our knowledge, there are no previous experiments on automatic diagnosis
of RANs of cellular networks. Hence, our criterion is based on experience in other application
domains and in general characteristics of the summarized techniques.
The main reasons for discarding the other alternatives are the following. Firstly, CFs are
8“Inference is NP-hard” means that it is not possible to obtain an algorithm of polynomial complexity for

not recommended, mainly because of the lack of solid theoretical bases, which can lead to
incoherent conclusions. Secondly, as advantage, D-S theory accepts an incomplete probabilistic
model when some parameters (e.g. prior or conditional probabilities) are missing. However, D-S
theory is more diﬃcult to interpret that BNs: it estimates how close the evidence is to force
the truth of the hypothesis, instead of estimating how close the hypothesis is to being true.
Finally, the philosophy of fuzzy logic is diﬀerent to that of BNs, in the sense that fuzzy logic
is concerned with vagueness, whereas BNs deals with probabilities. There are long discussions
about the utilization of fuzzy logic vs. BNs [121, 79, 129, 197, 78]. Some authors argue that
both techniques are complementary rather than competitive [204], whereas others defend that
one of them includes the other [122, 128, 137]. In this thesis, probability has been preferred to
fuzzy logic as mathematical basis to model diagnosis systems. However, in the future it is not
ruled out to build a diagnosis system for cellular networks based on fuzzy logic and to compare
results with the ones achieved in this thesis.
It should be pointed out that no diagnosis system other than the one based on BNs has been
implemented. Hence, the selection of the technique has not been based on comparisons of the
techniques above.
Although, up to our knowledge, there are no previous systems for diagnosis in cellular net-
works, the number of applications in other domains are enormous. The ﬁelds that have had
more inﬂuence on this thesis are the following ones:
• Traditionally, medicine has been the outstanding application for automatic diagnosis sys-
tems. Hence, it is logical that BNs have been frequently used to build medical diagnosis
systems. One of the ﬁrst applications of BNs were Munin [34], which diagnosed neuromus-
cular disorders and Pathﬁnder [99], which performed diagnosis of lymph-node diseases.
Since then, the number of applications of BNs to medicine have grown exponentially
[199, 146, 35, 154, 147, 144].
• Due to their proximity, the application of BNs to telecommunications has also been the
focus of our preliminary survey. BNs have been successfully used for fault management in
the core of communications networks [115, 182, 190, 73, 183] or in satellite communication
systems [107, 131].
• Diagnosis of faults in printers have also contributed to the development of troubleshooting
based on BNs. The research carried out by Microsoft [96, 51, 100, 94, 98, 101] and HP
[174, 111, 175, 173] are specially remarkable.

Introduction to BNs
A BN eﬃciently represents a joint probability distribution over a set of random variables. BNs
are graphically depicted as directed graphs. A directed graph consists of a set of variables and
a set of directed links, also called directed edges, between variables. In a directed graph, if there
is a link between variable A and variable B, it is said that B is a child of A and A is a parent
of B.
A variable may be continuous or discrete. In the latter case, the variable can have any ﬁnite
number of states9. For example, a discrete variable may be the result of tossing a die (whose
states are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and a continuous variable may be the temperature in a room. A
variable is in exactly one of its states, although which one it is may be unknown to us.
BNs may be used to infer how a change of certainty in one variable may change the certainty
for other variables. For example, knowing that I have fever increases my belief in me having
ﬂu. When the state of a variable is known, it is said that it is instantiated. Relations among
variables can be classiﬁed in the following types:
• Serial connection. In Fig.3.3, A has an inﬂuence on B, which has an inﬂuence on C.
Hence, evidence on A will inﬂuence the certainty of B, which then inﬂuences the certainty
of C. Similarly, evidence on C will inﬂuence the certainty on A through B. However, if
the state of B is known, then the channel is blocked, and A and C become independent.
It is said that A and C are d-separated given B.
Example. A represents the state of the battery of a car (OK/dead), B speciﬁes whether
the car will start (yes/no) and C deﬁnes whether the car will move (yes/no). Knowing
that the battery is dead (A =dead) strongly increases our belief in the car not moving
(C =no). But if we know that the car does not start (B =no), knowing the state of the
battery (A) does not give us more information about whether the car will move (C). BNs
can be also used in the backward direction. In this case, knowing that the car does not
move, highly increases our believe in the car not starting. In turn, if we believe that it is
probable that the car will not start, we will increase our belief in the battery being dead.
But if we know that the car does not start, knowing that the car does not move will not
change our belief in the state of the battery.

• Diverging connection. In Fig.3.4, inﬂuence can pass between all the children of A unless
the state of A is known. It is said that B, C, ..., E are d-separated given A.
Example. Fig.3.5 shows the causal relations between Sex (male/female), length of hair
(long/short) and stature (< 168 cm/ > 168 cm). If we do not know the sex of a person,
seeing the length of his/her hair will tell us more about the sex, and this in turn will focus
our belief on his/her stature. On the other hand, if we know that the person is a man,
then the length of his hair gives us no extra clue on his stature.
Rule 2: Evidence may be transmitted through a diverging connection unless it is instan-
tiated.
• Converging connection. Fig.3.6 shows a converging connection. If nothing is known
about A except what may be inferred from knowledge of its parents B, ..., E, then the
parents are independent, i.e. evidence on one of them has no inﬂuence on the certainty
of the others.
In other words, knowledge of one possible cause of an event does not
tell us anything about other possible causes. However, if something is known about the
consequences, then information on one possible cause may tell us something about the
other causes.
Example.
In Fig.3.7, if we do not know if a person has nausea or pallor, then the
information on whether the person has a salmonella infection will not tell us anything
about the person having ﬂu. However, if we have noticed that the person is pale, then
the information that he/she does not have a salmonella infection will increase our belief

Rule 3: Evidence may only be transmitted through a converging connection if either the
variable in the connection or one of its descendants has received evidence.
Two distinct variables A and B in a causal network are d-separated if, for all paths between
A and B, there is an intermediate variable V such that either:
• The connection is serial or diverging and V is instantiated, or
• the connection is converging, and neither V nor any of V ’s descendants have received
evidence
If A and B are not d-separated, we call them d-connected.
Deﬁnition of BN
A discrete Bayesian Network consists of the following:
• A set of variables and a set of directed edges between variables
• Each variable has a ﬁnite set of mutually exclusive states

Figure 3.8: Example of BN
• The variables together with the directed edges form a directed acyclic graph.
• To each variable A with parents B1, ..., Bn, there is a table10 P(A|B1, ..., Bn) attached. If
A has no parents, the table reduces to prior probabilities P(A).
The deﬁnition of BN does not refer to causality, and there is no requirement that the links
represent causal impacts. Instead, it is required that the d-separation properties implied by the
structure hold.
Although discrete BNs are most common, their variables may be also continuous. In that
case, instead of probability tables, pdfs are required.
Example. Fig.3.8 shows a simple BN for diagnosis of excessive dropped calls in cellular
networks. The possible causes in this example are Lack of Coverage (no/yes) and Interference
(no/yes). Their symptoms are Signal Quality (low/normal) and Signal level (low/normal). For
the quantitative modelling, the probability assessments P(Coverage), P(Interference), P(Level
|Coverage), P(Quality|Coverage, Interference) are required (Table 3.1).
The chain rule for BNs
Let U = {A1, ..., An} be an universe of variables.
If the joint probability table P(U) =
P(A1, ..., An) is known, then the probability P(Ai) as well as P(Ai|e), where e is evidence,
can be calculated from P(U). However, P(U) grows exponentially with the number of variables.
Hence, even with a reduced number of variables, the table for P(U) becomes intractably large.
Therefore, a method of storing information from which P(U) can be calculated is required. A
BN over U is such a representation. If the conditional independencies in the BN hold for U,
then P(U) can be calculated from the probabilities speciﬁed in the BN. The chain rule helps to
face that task:
Chain rule: Let BN be a BN over U = {A1, ..., An}. The joint probability distribution
P(U) is the product of all probabilities speciﬁed in BN:

Probability updating in BNs can be performed by using the chain rule to calculate P(U).
Alternatively, the calculations can be performed without having to deal with the full joint
probability table. Additionally, in most cases, Bayes’rule11 must be also applied.
A variable is marginalized out of a probability table if the dependency of the table with that
variable is eliminated. In order to marginalize, the sum of the probability table for all possible
values of the variable to be marginalized is calculated. For example, if B is marginalized out of
P(A, B), the resulting probability table is P(A) and can be obtained as:
P(A) =
X

P(A, B)

Evidence propagation is out of the scope of this thesis. Interested readers are addressed to
the numerous algorithms found in the literature for belief updating [54, 110, 157, 64].
Example. Consider the BN in Fig.3.8. Assume that we have the evidence e = {L=normal,
Q=low} and we wish to calculate P(C|L=normal, Q=low), where I=Interference, C=Coverage,
L=Level, Q=Quality. In this case:
P(U, e) = P(I, C, L = normal, Q = low) =
= P(I)P(C)P(L = normal|C)P(Q = low|I, C)
It should be noticed that calculating the full table P(U) with 24 entries is not required. On
the contrary, in order to calculate P(C, e) the variable I is marginalized out of P(U):
P(C, L = normal, Q = low) =

Subsequently, the two tables P(I) and P(Q = low|I, C) are multiplied and I is marginalized
out of the product. This table depends on three variables, instead of the four original ones. In
order to calculate P(C|e) we simply apply the Bayes’rule:

3.2.2
Bayesian modelling
The construction of a model based on BNs can be divided into two parts. The ﬁrst stage deﬁnes
the qualitative model, which consists of the variables and their relationships. The second part
speciﬁes the quantitative model, that is the probabilities required for the probability tables in
the BN.
The purpose of a BN model is to give estimates of certainties, i.e. probabilities, for events
that are not observable (or only observable at an unacceptable cost). These events are called
hypothesis events. Hypothesis variables are groups of mutually exclusive events. In order to
obtain a certainty estimate, there should be some information channels which may reveal some-
thing about the hypothesis variables. These types of information are grouped into information
variables.
Having identiﬁed the variables for the model, the next step is establishing the directed links.
It is essential that the conditional independencies coded in the model correspond with reality.
The quantitative part of the model can be obtained from diﬀerent sources: subjective proba-
bilities elicited by experts, statistical data or theoretical considerations. Several techniques have
been proposed to ease the deﬁnition of parameters [175, 188, 76].
Modelling can be simpliﬁed if some conditions are assumed about the dependencies in the
network. This gives rise to diﬀerent network structures, such as the Simple Bayes Model or
simpliﬁcations of the required probabilities, such as Independence of Causal Inﬂuence models
[97, 180, 95], which will be both discussed in Chapter 5.
3.2.3
Learning
In some application domains large databases of cases12 exist, which can be used to build the
model. Learning is the process of building a BN based on previous training cases. In structural
learning the network structure that best ﬁts the information is calculated [140, 94, 179, 63, 64,
143]. In parameter learning a network structure is assumed and the probabilities are computed
based on the cases [71, 49, 127, 83]. Structural learning is out of the scope of this thesis, whereas
parameter learning will be dealt in Chapter 5.
3.2.4
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis refers to the study of how sensitive the conclusions (probabilities of the
hypothesis variables) are to minor changes. The changes may be variations of the parameters
of the model or may be changes of the evidence.
For example, for the network in Fig.3.8, a parameter could be the probability t = P(Quality=
low| Interference=no, Coverage=yes). The expression P(Interference=yes|e(t)) is the variation
of the probability of interference given the evidence vs. the parameter t.
12A case is the set of values assigned to some information variables in the BN.
MENÚ
SALIR

3.2. BAYESIAN NETWORKS
51
One-way sensitivity analysis studies the inﬂuence of a single parameter on the conclusions.
Two-way sensitivity analysis analyzes the impact of changing two parameters simultaneously on
the hypothesis variables.
Basically, there are two approaches to sensitivity analysis: theoretical and empirical. The
theoretical approach expresses the posterior probability of interest in terms of the parameters
under study [110, 55, 126, 120, 81]. The empirical methods examine the eﬀects of varying the
parameters of the network on the diagnosis. In the latter case, the most frequent approach
consists of adding random noise to the probabilities and examining the eﬀects on the diagnostic
performance [103, 118, 158].

Diagnosis in GSM/GPRS networks
This chapter is devoted to the description of the knowledge base, i.e. the knowledge about
the application domain. Thus, fault diagnosis in GERAN is explained. In order to build a
diagnosis model the possible causes which may give rise to the problem and their corresponding
symptoms as well as the conditioning parameters have to be identiﬁed. Diagnosis is carried out
independently in each cell with problems. The identiﬁcation of the problematic cells is performed
by the Fault Detection subsystem, which is outside the scope of this thesis. Therefore, it has
been assumed that the diagnosis system is utilized only on cells with problems.
In Section 4.1 the terminology utilized in this chapter is described and the methodological
approach is summarized. Section 4.2 describes the main problem in GSM networks, i.e. the
situation that triggers the requirement of a diagnosis, which is an excessive number of dropped
calls. Diﬀerent ﬁgures to measure dropped calls are also reviewed in that section. The main
causes that may provoke dropped calls are depicted in Section 4.3. Afterwards, the informa-
tion available to support the identiﬁcation of the cause (named symptoms), which are network
performance indicators and alarms, are explained in Section 4.4. Furthermore, there are other
factors (named conditions) that have an inﬂuence on the behavior of the network, such as some
functionalities and conﬁguration parameters, which are described in Section 4.5. The qualitative
relationships amongst causes, symptoms and conditions, together with some examples from a
live network, are presented in Section 4.6. Finally, in Appendix 4.A, some specially complex TS
cases solved by experts are explained.
Although this chapter is entitled “diagnosis in GSM/GERAN”, actually the focus is on GSM,
due to the fact that the analysed problem is the excessive dropped call rate. Therefore, a basic
knowledge of GSM is required to follow this chapter (see Chapter 2 or [142, 162]).
4.1
Introduction
4.1.1
Basic deﬁnitions
A problem is deﬁned as a situation in a cell which has a degrading impact on the service oﬀered
by that cell. Every operator uses a diﬀerent method to identify the problematic cells, which
55
MENÚ
SALIR

CHAPTER 4. DIAGNOSIS IN GSM/GPRS NETWORKS
can be based on diﬀerent performance indicators, e.g. dropped calls, access failures, congestion,
etc.
[123].
The most severe problem for mobile network operators are cells experiencing a
high number of dropped calls because a dropped call has a very negative impact on the service
oﬀered to the end user. The metrics used to identify these cells varies from operator to operator.
Some operators use the absolute number of drops as the determining criteria, others favour the
dropped call rate while sometimes the time between two successive dropped calls (Minutes per
drop) is also applied to rank cells. Once the cells with problems are isolated, a diagnosis of the
cause of the problems should be done for each problematic cell separately.
A cause or fault is the defective behavior of some logical or physical component in the cell
that provokes failures and, ﬁnally, generates a problem. An example of physical cause is a fault
in a TRX, whereas an example of logical cause is interference in a cell due to a sub-optimal
frequency plan.
A symptom1 is a performance indicator or an alarm whose value can be a manifestation of
a fault, e.g. the received signal level in the uplink path.
A failure is an anomalous value of a symptom, which can be caused by a fault, e.g. excessive
number of interference handovers. Therefore, a problem is a type of failure that has a negative
inﬂuence on the service oﬀered to subscribers.
A condition is a factor whose value makes the probability of certain cause occurring increase
or decrease. For example, a condition is the functionality of Frequency Hopping (FH)2 because
if it is active the cause interference is less probable than if FH is not activated.
Fig.4.1 depicts the relations amongst the concepts explained above. A cell is at a given state,
which may be either correct operation or malfunctioning. The Fault Detection subsystem is in
charge of determining which one of the states the cell is in. The values of the symptoms are
manifestations of the state of the cell. If the cell is experiencing problems due to a fault, failures
come up, i.e. some symptoms display values quite diﬀerent from those normally seen on the
cell. In addition, conditions also impact on the behavior of the cell, sometimes preventing the
presence of some faults. Finally, if failures are serious they can aﬀect the client and, therefore,
degenerate in a problem. The diagnosis system aims at identifying the cause of the problem.
The complete mobile system includes millions of parameters for all the cells in the network.
Ideally all of these have to be taken into account to explain the behavior of the network. However,
symptoms and conditions are so numerous that it is not feasible to consider all of them in order
to carry out the diagnosis. Furthermore, some issues, such as the geography of the cell or the
1At this point, it is important to clarify the use that the word symptom will have in this thesis: it does not
have any negative connotation, i.e. a symptom can take any value and not only anomalous values. Confusion
often arises from the use of the term given in medicine, where a symptom is deﬁned as “a change in the body’s
condition that is a sign of illness” [106]. A more general deﬁnition of symptom is “a sign of the existence of
something”. For example, fever (temperature>37oC) is a sign of ﬂue. However, the word symptom can be used in
a wider sense as a sign of the existence or nonexistence of something. Thus, in the previous example the symptom
would be the temperature and not only the fever (which is a range of the temperature) because if temperature is
lower than 37oC it is a sign that probably the patient does not have ﬂue. In this thesis, the symptoms will be the
alarms and performance indicators, and not only some values of performance indicators (i.e. failures) and active
alarms. For example, the temperature or the signal level will be denoted as symptoms, instead of the fever or a
signal level lower than X dBm, respectively.

propagation conditions, also have an impact on the cell state. The behavior of a given cell
may be even aﬀected by the performance of its neighboring cells. Because of all these reasons,
the knowledge base is a model which highly simpliﬁes the behavior of the actual network. The
presence of random processes, such as noise in the transmission or the inﬂuence of weather on the
propagation conditions, together with the impossibility to exactly describe the scenario requires
the adoption of non-determinist models.
The aim of the diagnosis system is to identify the cause of a problem based on the values
of the symptoms and conditions. Therefore, the problems, causes, symptoms and conditions to
be considered in the model should be determined in order to deﬁne the knowledge base used by
the diagnosis system.
4.1.2
Methodology
The knowledge base presented in this chapter is composed of the causes, symptoms and con-
ditions that operators most frequently use for diagnosis. The information described hereafter
is based on interviews with troubleshooting experts of diverse operators and on my experience
about radio access networks acquired during the development of this thesis. Thus, the qualitative
relations among causes, symptoms and conditions have been deﬁned based on knowledge.
4.2
Problem: Dropped calls
This section is devoted to the deﬁnition of the “problem” concept, which will determine under
which circumstances diagnosis is required. Indeed, it is assumed that the diagnosis system is
used only on cells which are known to have problems. The task of determining whether a cell
is experiencing problems is not part of the diagnosis system, but it is assigned to the Fault
Detection System (see Fig.2.7).

CHAPTER 4. DIAGNOSIS IN GSM/GPRS NETWORKS
Each operator uses diﬀerent metrics to identify which cells have problems. This is due to
the fact that no standards exist for fault detection and operators have often slightly diﬀerent
objectives. However, some indicators are common to all operators. Amongst the most important
indicators, the high number of dropped calls, the blocked call rate and the high number of access
failures stand out. Furthermore, there is no globally accepted measure for calculating them (i.e.
the ﬁnal equation), which can be done in many ways.
This thesis focuses on one of the most important existing problems in GSM/GPRS networks:
the occurrence of a high number of dropped calls. Before explaining how to measure the dropped
calls, the diﬀerences between call and connection should be clariﬁed [162]. Obtaining a traﬃc
channel in a cell is denoted connection. A call is obtaining a traﬃc channel in a cell due to a call
originated in the mobile phone or ﬁnished in the mobile phone. Therefore, the connections of a
cell A are composed of the calls done in the cell (initiated or terminated in the MS connected
to that cell), the handovers from other cells to cell A and the changes of traﬃc channels inside
cell A (intracell handovers). Thus, for each call there is at least one connection.
A call is dropped when it ﬁnishes abnormally, i.e. it does not conclude because of the will of
one of the two end users. A dropped call has a very negative impact on the quality of service
perceived by the end user. This is the reason why achieving a low number of dropped calls is
a crucial objective of mobile network operators. Dropped calls are registered in the network
statistics and, depending on the manufacturer of the equipment, dropped calls can be even
classiﬁed according to the reason that caused that drop. It should be pointed out that the aim
of operators is not arriving at a 0% of dropped calls because the cost would be too high, but
achieving an “acceptable” percentage of dropped calls. The following sentence from an operator
summerises the previous philosophy: “we do not want to be the best, but be close to the best or
slightly better than the local competitor”. In mature networks, the percentage of dropped calls
is normally around 1 or 2% [90].
There are many diﬀerent formulas to calculate the dropped calls. The most common ones
are in one of the following groups:
• Dropped Call Rate (DCR): percentage of dropped calls over total number of calls. It is the
most common formula to measure dropped calls.
• Drop-out Ratio: percentage of dropped calls over total number of connections.
• Minutes Per Dropped Calls (MPD): time between two successive dropped calls in a cell.
It is a very important indicator because the lower the time between drops the worse the
problem. Thus, it is a very eﬃcient metric to identify the worst performing cells.
Previous formulas can vary slightly.
For example, some operators consider also call re-
establishments in the total number of calls.
Apart from those measurements, it is also important to take into account the absolute number
of dropped calls because a high percentage of dropped calls is not so serious in a cell with little
traﬃc, but very worrying in a cell with a signiﬁcant amount of traﬃc.

Causes of dropped calls
Table 4.1 summarizes the most common faults that may cause a high number of dropped calls
in GERAN, which will be described in the following sections. Each cause can be split in several
subcauses, which could be also considered in the model, e.g. the cause “interference” could be
caused by an incorrect frequency plan or by external sources such as a television station. For
simplicity sake, in this thesis, only high level causes have been included into the diagnosis model.
4.3.1
Interference
Most current cellular networks are interference limited, due to the tight reuse patterns3 used.
That means that in those networks interference imposes the capacity limit that the network is
able to cope with.
Interference causes a high error rate and frame loss, which eventually leads to the release of
the radio channel, i.e. to a dropped call. The sources of interference are numerous, the ones
that stand out are the following [11]:
• Other mobile network operator is transmitting on the same frequency. Normally this is
due to an incorrect setting.
• Cells overlap, i.e. cells from own network exceed the nominal coverage. It can be caused
by an insuﬃcient antenna tilt, excessive transmitted power, inadequate frequency plan, a
change in the environment (for example, someone may have cut down a forest of trees that
had been blocking the signal from that site), etc.
3Tight reuse pattern means that the same frequency is used in close cells. Thus, the consequence is that those
cells interfere with each other.
MENÚ

CHAPTER 4. DIAGNOSIS IN GSM/GPRS NETWORKS
• Close channels interference.
As the spectrum is becoming saturated, new services are
assigned closer frequencies. This may cause interference in the adjacent channels.
• Intermodulation.
External signals may cause intermodulation products when they are
mixed in the non-linear ampliﬁer of the base-station transmitter. Even physical struc-
tures close to the antenna, such as a roof or a fence, can act as non-linear elements, also
generating intermodulation products.
• Interference from external transmitters. Close television or radio stations may have har-
monics of considerable energy which interfere with the cellular network.
Interference may be present in the uplink path (aﬀecting the reception of the base station)
or in the downlink path (aﬀecting the reception of the mobile station). The statistical charac-
teristics of the interference are diﬀerent in each path because a mobile receives interference from
a limited number of ﬁx locations (the base stations), whereas the base stations are interfered by
a potentially large number of moving mobile stations.
Actually, the important parameter is not the absolute interference level, but the ratio between
the wanted signal level, the carrier C, and the interfering signal level, I, i.e. the ratio C
I . On
the one hand, C varies with the propagation ﬂuctuations and with the distance between the
MS and the serving base station. On the other hand, I basically depends on the distance to
the interfering cells, and therefore, on the reuse pattern. The error probability is related to
C
I . Thus, the network oﬀers an adequate degree of quality against interference only when C
I is
higher than a given threshold, denoted protection ratio. For example, the Specs4 [29] establish
that the protection ratio for the co-channel5 interference is 9 dB. Other issues that have an
inﬂuence in the C
I distribution are the power control, the discontinuous transmission and the
frequency hopping, which will be described in Section 4.5.
4.3.2
Coverage
Coverage faults include two types of causes: lack of coverage and excessive distance between MS
and BTS. In any case, the ﬁnal result is a degradation in quality and, ﬁnally, a dropped call
either because of the low level or the poor quality.
Lack of coverage
There is lack of coverage if the received signal level is below the (MS or BTS) receivers sensitivity.
The coverage area of a cell can be deﬁned by measuring the signal level received from the
base stations. That means knowing the C distribution within a cell. Actually, the situation is
more complex and cells overlap, i.e. there are areas where an active MS may be connected to
various cells, depending on the direction where the MS came from. Hence, the distribution of C

in a cell, and therefore the cell area, is determined by the propagation from the own BTS, the
propagation from BTS of neighboring cells and the handovers criteria [142].
The lack of coverage has been classiﬁed into two types: lack of coverage in the borders of the
cell and shadow zones within a cell. Lack of coverage in the borders usually shows up in rural
areas, i.e. in areas with low density of population. In these areas, tele-traﬃc density is normally
low and cells tend to have large coverage areas. Those cells are normally limited by the uplink
path because the signal levels transmitted by mobiles located close to the cell borders are not
enough for the BTS receiver. It can also happen, although less frequently, that mobiles in the
borders do not receive with enough power the transmissions from the BTS.
Lack of coverage can also happen in shadow zones within the cell. In those areas the signal
level received by either the MS or the BTS is low, e.g. due to the presence of obstacles. This
cause may show up both in rural cells and in urban areas, although it is more common in the
latter case.
Excessive distance
In this case, a call is dropped because the distance between the MS and the BTS is longer than
35 km. This cause is related with the method to carry out the synchronization on the radio
subsystem in GSM networks [28, 162], which is the following. Due to the fact that the channels
in GSM are shared according to a TDMA scheme, collisions may occur in the uplink path if
two MSs transmit in the same TS (and the same frequency). For example, this situation may
happen when two MSs are planned to use consecutive TS and are situated at diﬀerent distances
from the BTS, the second scheduled MS being at a shorter distance that the ﬁrst one. As a
result of the diﬀerent propagation times, the arrival of the burst of the ﬁrst scheduled MS gets
delayed with respect to the second one, thereby producing an overlap of the signals in time.
The solution in GSM is that the BTS sends to each MS a timing advance parameter (TA)
according to the perceived round trip propagation delay BTS-MS-BTS. The MS advances its
timing by this amount, with the result that signals from diﬀerent MSs arriving at the BTS are
compensated for propagation delay. This process is called adaptive frame alignment. In the
downlink path these collision problems do not exist because each MS obtains its bursts from the
common frame transmitted by the BTS without aﬀecting the other MSs.
The timing advance6 is in the range 0 to 63. Thus, the maximum distance between the MS
and the BTS is 35 Km, which corresponds to TA=63. In rural areas, antennas normally have
a low tilt angle because it is not necessary to sacriﬁce coverage to limit interference, due to
6When the BTS detects an access burst transmission on the RACH, it shall measure the delay of this signal
relative to the expected signal from a MS at zero distance under static channel conditions. This delay, the timing
advance, shall be rounded to the nearest symbol period and be included in a response from the BTS. The BTS
shall thereafter continuously monitor the delay of the normal bursts sent by the MS. If the delay changes by more
than one symbol period, the timing advance shall be advanced or delayed 1 and the new value signalled to the
MS.
Each unit of TA corresponds to a transmission delay equal to a round-trip symbol duration, which, in distance,
is equivalent to about 550 m. For example, when TA= 1 the MS is at a distance from the BTS between 550 and
1100 m. The maximum value of TA is 63 because the access burst transmitted by the MS shall be received by
the BTS within a given TS and, on the other hand, access bursts have a guard period of duration 68.25 bits.

the loose reuse pattern. In that case, it may happen that a MS stays connected to a certain
BTS even if the distance to another BTS is lower, the reason being that the MS receives higher
signal level from the farther BTS than from the closer one. If TA is higher than 63, due to
the aforementioned synchronization constraints and no matter what the received power is, the
network will automatically drop the call. This problem could be solved by down-tilting the
antenna [196], thus forcing calls to be handed oﬀthe cell earlier.
4.3.3
Hardware
This cause groups faults of the base station equipment. The base station modules are composed
of elements that deteriorate over time, some failing gradually and others suddenly. The eﬀects
of hardware faults can go from both reduced signal level and quality to only a quality decrease
in one of the radio links. In most cases, when there is a hardware fault numerous alarms are
triggered.
Fig.4.2 shows the main functional systems which compose a BTS. The following faults, which
corresponds to the diverse subsystems, have been distinguished:
• Fault in one of the TRXs (TRXn). The transceivers (Transmitter/Receiver) or TRXs
are the equipment that manage each of the carriers. The BTSs may have one or more
TRXs. A TRX includes a power ampliﬁer for the downlink, a transmitter, a receiver and
a baseband unit (which is in charge of coding, interleaving, encryption and assembly in
bursts).
• Combiner fault. Combiners are used to connect various transmitters with close frequencies

to a single antenna. Isolation among transmitters is assured and the signal from each of
them is provide to the antenna with minimum coupling.
• Antenna fault.
• Other faults in the RF transmission chain. It includes faults in the antenna feeder, the
connectors, the cables, etc.
• Other faults in the RF reception chain. The reception chain is composed of diverse sub-
systems: MHA, duplexors, preselectors, antenna multicouplers, switch matrices, etc.
– The Masthead Ampliﬁer (MHA) is a low noise ampliﬁer located between the antenna
and the antenna feeder cable. The MHA compensates the cable losses and improves
the noise ﬁgure of the receiver. The result is an improvement in the uplink chain, a
decrease in the link imbalance and, ultimately, an increase of the coverage area.
– A duplexer allows a single antenna to be used to transmit and receive, isolating
transmitter and receiver. Typically, duplexers are composed of two bandpass ﬁlters,
one for the transmitter and the other one for the receiver. In GSM, duplexers are
not normally used because individual antennas for transmission and reception are
preferred.
– A preselector is composed of a bandpass ﬁlter of 25 MHz bandwidth and a RF ampli-
ﬁer. The purpose of the ﬁlter is avoiding the entrance of out of band signals, whereas
the ampliﬁer provide the required gain to compensate the losses in the antenna feeder,
the multicouplers and the reception matrices.
– The antenna multicouplers or power dividers have one input and multiple outputs so
that multiple receivers can be connected to a single antenna.
– Reception matrices allows the connection of any antenna to any receiver. They include
the required power divider modules.
• Other HW faults. Besides the previous elements, base stations include other subsystems,
such as synchronization circuits, power supply, A-bis interface connection, air conditioning,
etc. Any of these might be the cause of the fault.
4.3.4
Transmission
Transmission causes have been divided into two subcauses: link failure and transcoder failure.
The ﬁrst group includes faults in the A-bis interface and in the A interface.
A-bis Interface faults
These faults can happen at the interface between the BTS and the BSC, i.e.
at the A-bis
interface [20]. The physical level of this interface is composed of 2 Mbps links (32 channels of
64 kbps), according to the ITU G.703 Recommendation [13].
In the A-bis interface the types of interchanged information are:

• Messages between the BTS and the BSC in order to control the BTS, by means of the
LAPD protocol. The messages are sent to certain piece of equipment (TRX or BCF7) so
that it carries out a given task.
• Messages between the MS and the BSC or any other part of the network beyond the BSC.
These messages transparently cross through the BTS, i.e. they are not analyzed by the
BTS.
A Interface faults
Failures of the A-interface [15], i.e. the link between the BSC and the MSC, may also lead to
dropped calls. The physical layer of the A-interface is also composed of 2 Mbps digital links,
according to G.703 Recommendation.
Transcoder failures
In the air interface, voice channels are coded at 13 kbps, whereas in the rest of the network
channels must be coded at 64 kbps, according to the G.703 Recommendation. Therefore, a
system to adapt those rates is required: the Transcoder and Rate Adaptation Unit (TRAU).
Although the TRAU is functionally8 part of the BTS, normally it is located close to the MSC,
as shown in Fig.4.3.
7BCF: Base station Control Function. It is the part of the BTS which handles all control functions within the
BTS.
8The TRAU is functionally considered part of the BTS, although the Specs allow various locations. Firstly,
the TRAU could be located in the BSS. In that case, each channel would go at 16 kbps (13 kbps + signalling)
between the TRAU and the TRXs, whereas in the A interface transmission would go at 64 kbps. For 4 voice
channel, 4 PCM channels at 64 kbps would be required in the A-interface, using only 2 bits per PCM time slot
and, therefore, wasting 6 bits.
A more economic location of the TRAU is close to the MSC (Fig.4.3). In that case, in the BSS, 4 channels at
16 kbps could be multiplexed in one single PCM channel. Thus, at the A interface only one link at 64 kbps would
be required to transmit the 4 voice channels. In Fig.4.3, it can be observed that between the TRAU and the MSC
there are 4 links at 64 kbps because the TRAU only changes the rate, it does not multiplex. If the TRAU and
the MSC are in the same site, those links will be local connections.
A BSC can be connected to several TRAUs because each TRAU is used for a 2 Mbps link. A typical TRAU
can have as input a link with 120 channels at 16 kbps and an output of 120 channels of 64 kbps.

65
The most important components of a TRAU are the interfaces with the BSC and the MSC,
the system controller and the equipment for transcoding and rate adaptation.
4.3.5
Others
There are other faults not included in the ones explained in the previous sections, which occur
more rarely. Among them, the following ones stand out: fading, bad adjacency deﬁnition and
erroneous conﬁguration parameters.
Fading
Transmission through the mobile channel is subject to fading due to multipath propagation. In
channels with multiple reﬂections, such as in urban areas with several buildings, if transmission
is always done on the same frequency it may occur that successive frames might not be decoded.
The mobiles more aﬀected by fading are the stationary or very slow ones. Fading causes a high
frame error rate, which may lead to dropped calls.
Adjacency deﬁnition
In order to execute a handover, quality and level measurements of neighboring cells should be
done. With this aim, the BSC shall send to the MS a list of frequencies corresponding to the
adjacent cells that it has to measure (BA list, BCCH Allocation list) [27].
Therefore, it is
important to keep a well deﬁned and up to date adjacency list, so that the handover is always
done to the best possible cell.
Two problems may arise [186]:
• Adjacencies that should not be in the list. In that case, the list includes cells from which
the average received signal level is too low. Consequently, calls may drop if, at a certain
moment, the signal level coming from one of those cells increases and the MS tries to do
a handover to that cell.
• Missing important adjacencies. If cells from which the average received signal level is high
are omitted in the list, calls may drop when trying to do a handover to cells with lower
signal level.
Conﬁguration parameters
In the RAN there are thousands of parameters per BTS, which should be updated when the
network evolves. If any of the important parameters is incorrect, dropped calls may appear. An
example of parameters are the ones used for handovers, such as the threshold for level handovers.

Symptoms: Performance Indicators and Alarms

Probability Density Function 
Figure 4.4: Probability density function of symptom depending on fault cause
PM monitors and analyzes the managed network elements [24, 12]. The data which helps to
measure the network performance have been called symptoms. Symptoms can be divided into
two groups: performance indicators and alarms.
Amongst performance indicators, the most important ones are called Key Performance Indi-
cators (KPIs). KPIs are collected daily by the NMS with the help of counters located in diﬀerent
points of the network [10] (see page 2.1.5). Thus, the NMS contains statistics of thousands of
KPIs related to traﬃc, quality of service, network conﬁguration, failure rate, etc. They can
either be referred to the busy hour or be average values for the entire day.
Alarms are the second type of symptoms. Manufacturers of equipment provide hundreds of
alarms which are triggered when there is a fault related to a network entity. As this thesis is
focused on performance indicators, no deeper information about alarms will be given. Interested
readers are referred to the technical documentation of network equipment.
Symptoms are very important for diagnosis because their values can pinpoint certain fault.
When the network works as planned, e.g. when the number of dropped calls is low, symptoms
display a diﬀerent statistical distribution compare to the case when a fault is present. Likewise,
the distribution of the symptoms are diﬀerent for each of the causes. For example, the average
received signal level from MSs in a cell with a lack of coverage is lower than the signal level in a
cell that is operating normally. Fig.4.4 shows the pdf for the ratio of samples with signal level
lower than -100 dBm for cells without problems and cells suﬀering from lack of coverage. In this
example, pdfs have been created using histograms from a live network.

4.4.1
Symptoms related to dropped calls
Number of dropped calls and DCR
As described in Section 4.2, the main indicator of problems in the network is the presence of
a high number of dropped calls9, which has a very negative impact on end users. There are
many diﬀerent formulas to calculate the dropped calls and each operator uses his own equations.
Furthermore, two diﬀerent symptoms should be separately considered: the absolute number of
dropped calls (which is especially important for fault detection) and the percentage of dropped
calls (DCR).
Dropped call components
Amongst their KPIs, many manufacturers of equipment provide an estimation of the type of fault
that is causing the dropped calls. In most cases, those KPIs do not pinpoint the ultimate fault
which is causing the problem, but diverse reasons can increase related counters. For example,
the counter related to signalling faults in the A-bis interface can increase if the BSC do not
receive a channel activation acknowledgement from the BTS, if measurement reports are not
received from the BTS, etc. The ultimate causes of the previous failures can go from a fault in
the BTS to interference in one of the TRXs.
KPIs related to dropped call components are normally measured as the percentage of dropped
calls due to a given reason. The dropped calls components that have been considered as symp-
toms for the diagnosis model are the following ones:
• Radio Failure Component.
In GSM the main immediate cause for the network to
drop a call is a Radio Link Failure10. The reason being that a call should be released by
the network when its quality has degraded to a quality under which most clients would
manually release the call.
A radio failure can be caused by diverse faults, which make either the signal level or signal
quality be insuﬃcient to sustain the call. Those faults can go from interference or low
coverage to problems in the equipment (e.g. water in feeder, lost connections, antenna
misalignment, etc.), the environment (e.g.
city with many skyscrapers and, therefore,
many reﬂections), etc.
• Radio Failure in HO Component. It is similar to the previous fault, but it occurs
during a HO attempt. In this situation, a MS has received a Handover Command, but
9The number/percentage of dropped calls is a symptom, whereas the high number/percentage of dropped calls
is the problem.
10In the MS, the procedure to determine that a radio link failure has occurred uses a counter S [27, 26]. If
the MS is unable to decode a SACCH message, S is decreased by 1, whereas if a SACCH message is successfully
received, S in increased by 2. If S reaches zero, a radio link failure is declared. In any case, S should never exceed
the value of Radio Link Timeout, which is a value transmitted by each BTS. When there is a radio failure, the
MS releases all signalling channels and deactivates the dedicated channels.
On the contrary, the criterion to determine a radio link failure in the BSS is not deﬁned in the Specs and it has
to be decided by the operator. Normally, it is based either on the error probability on the SACCH in the uplink
or on level and quality measurements.
MENÚ

4.4. SYMPTOMS: PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND ALARMS

there has been a failure when trying to connect to the new channels [26]. In that case, the
MS would deactivate the new channels and reactivate the old TCH channel and associated
signalling channels. After that, a Handover Failure message would be sent to the BTS and
the MS would resume normal operation as if the HO attempt had not occurred. However,
if a failure occurs when trying to reactivate the old channels the call will drop. If the
reason of the unsuccessful reconnection has been a radio failure, the KPI “Radio Failure
in HO Component” will increase.
• A-bis interface Failure Component. The counter associated to this component in-
creases when a signalling message [22] from BTS to BSC is lost (e.g. missing acknowledge-
ment of channel activation, missing establishment indication, missing handover detection,
etc.), when an error indication is received from the BTS (because of a protocol error in the
air interface), when measurement reports are no longer received from BTS, when channel
assignment is not completed because no response is received from the MS before a timer
elapses [26], etc. Thus, if this counter increases, it can be due to diverse reasons, apart
from a fault in the physical connection, going from a faulty BTS to interference in a TRX.
• A-bis interface Failure in HO Component. This KPI indicates the same fault as the
previous one, but it increases when trying to return to the old channel after an unsuccessful
HO.
• LAPD Failure Component. This component increases when LAPD failures take place.
As explained in section 4.3.4, LAPD is the link layer protocol used for signalling on the
A-bis interface [21].
• A-interface Failure Component. This component is related with the protocols used in
the A interface [15, 19, 23]. For example, the counter associated to this component may
increase when a Clear Command is received from the MSC during the call setup phase
before the radio resources are assigned to the MS. Another reason for this indicator to
increase is an abnormal clear received due to signalling problems in the A interface.
• A-interface Failure in HO Component. It is the same fault as the previous one, but
when trying to return to the old channel after an unsuccessful HO.
• Transcoder Failure Component. This component indicates a transcoder failure during
a call attempt. The associated counter is updated when the BTS sends a Connection
Failure Indication to the BSC with the cause “remote transcoder failure” [22]. This counter
may increase not only when there is a transcoder fault, but also in case of a fault in the
BTS.
• Transcoder Failure in HO Component. It is the same fault as the previous one, but
when trying to return to the old channel after an unsuccessful HO.

CHAPTER 4. DIAGNOSIS IN GSM/GPRS NETWORKS
4.4.2
Level and quality
Symptoms described hereafter are performance indicators obtained from radio link measure-
ments, which are continuously carried out by the MSs (downlink) and the BTSs (uplink) during
a call. These measurements were deﬁned in the Specs to be used by the handover and power
control algorithms [27]. Two classes of measurements are performed: level and quality mea-
surements. On the one hand, BTSs measure level and quality in the uplink path. On the other
hand, MSs carry out quality and level measurements for the downlink path and they send report
messages, called Measurement Reports11, to the BSS with those level and quality measurements.
In any case, those measurements are quantiﬁed into intervals and symptoms are normally
calculated as the percentage of samples12, during a measurement period (e.g. day, hour, etc.)
per range of values. How level and quality measurements are carried out and how the intervals
are deﬁned will be explained hereafter.
Signal level
Both the MSs and the BSSs measure the received signal level at the receiver input over the full
range of -110 dBm to -48 dBm. Then, the average (in dBm) of the signal level measured samples
within the reporting period of length one SACCH multiframe is calculated. The measured signal
level shall be mapped to a parameter, named RXLEV, between 0 and 63, according to the
following intervals:
RXLEV = 0 ⇔level ≤−110 [dBm]
RXLEV = n ⇔−110 + n −1 [dBm] ≤level ≤−109 + n −1 [dBm] ; n = 1..62
RXLEV = 63 ⇔level > −48 [dBm]
(4.1)
11Quality and level measurements for the downlink path are carried out by the MSs and they are sent to the
BSS onto the SACCH channel in report messages called Measurement Reports. Measurement Reports contain the
following information:
• Level received from the serving cell, RXLEV FULL and RXLEV SUB. RXLEV FULL is calculated as the
average of each of the measurements taken in the TCH and SACCH frames of the SACCH multiframe,
i.e. the average of 25 · 4 = 100 measurements of the received signal level in the downlink traﬃc channel.
RXLEV SUB is calculated when using discontinuous transmission. It is the average of the measurements
taken in the SACCH frames of the SACCH multiframe and in the frames used to update the characteristics
of the comfort noise of discontinuous transmission, SID frames (see Section 4.5.3). In total, RXLEV SUB
is the average of 12 level measurements.
• Quality received from the serving cell, RXQUAL FULL and RXQUAL SUB. RXQUAL FULL is calculated
as the equivalent BER before channel decoding during a SACCH multiframe. RXQUAL SUB is computed
in a similar way, although in this case there are only 12 received frames: 4 SACCH frames and 8 SID
frames used for discontinuous transmission.
• Level received from the adjacent cells. The network sends a list (BA-list) containing the frequencies that
the MS should measure. Then, the MS measures the RXLEV for the BCCH carriers of the cells in the
list and ranks them in descending order. The measurement report contains the 6 higher RXLEV, together
with their corresponding frequencies and BSIC.
RXLEV and RXQUAL measurements are usually ﬁltered before being used by the network [8]. This is equivalent
to an average of the measurements, which softens the noise contribution and decreases the impact of fading.
12A sample is the value measured by the MS or BSS during a SACCH multiframe period. A SACCH multiframe
comprises 102 (470.8 ms) or 104 (480 ms) TDMA frames, for a TCH channel and a SDCCH channel, respectively.

Finally, level related symptoms are normally either in the form of average level during the
measurement period (e.g. day, hour, etc.) or they provide the percentage of samples in the
measurement period per interval or set of intervals. An example of level related symptom is the
“percentage of samples in the uplink whose RXLEV<10”.
Signal quality
Both the MSs and the BSSs should also measure the received signal quality in a manner that it
can be related to an equivalent average BER before channel decoding, assessed over the reporting
period of one SACCH multiframe. A parameter, named RXQUAL, is deﬁned, which quantiﬁes
the BER according to the rule shown in Table 4.3.
Symptoms related to RXQUAL are normally calculated as the percentage of samples in the
measurement period per range (RXQUAL=0..7) or group of bands (e.g. share with RXQUAL=5-
7). For example, a symptom could be the percentage of uplink quality samples out of band 0,
i.e. measurements with RXQUAL in bands 1 to 7 in the uplink path. If this symptom is high,
the cell is suﬀering from bad quality in the uplink.
4.4.3
Timing Advance
As explained in Section 4.3.2, the BSS calculates the delay of the signal received from each MS
relative to the expected signal from a MS at zero distance [28]. The distance of the MS to the
BTS is related to this delay. The TA parameter quantiﬁes the delay in units of a symbol period
(approx. 3.69 µs), which is related to the distance according to:
TA =
distance [m]
550

(4.2)
where ⌊x⌋is the integer part of x.
KPIs related to TA are normally calculated as percentage of samples during the measurement
period within a range of TA, e.g. percentage of samples with TA>10.

Measured Uplink interference
The BSS measures the interference level in the uplink on the idle time slots and calculates the
average over a certain number of consecutive SACCH multiframes [27]. The result is mapped
into one of the interference categories shown in Table 4.4. The limits between bands, Xi, are set
by operators and they can vary from cell to cell. For example, some typical values are shown in
Table 4.5.
Related symptoms are measured as the percentage of samples within each range or sets of
ranges. This symptom pinpoint an interference fault if the percentage of samples out of band 1
is greater than certain threshold, e.g. a typical threshold is 3%.
4.4.5
Handovers
The handover (HO) is a mechanism to transfer a call from cell to cell when a MS is moving. One
of the aims of HO is that the MS always stays connected to the best serving cell, performing
the change between cells without the client to notice.
The HO procedure [26] is always initiated by the network by sending a Handover Command
to the MS, which includes the characteristics of the new cell to where the HO is taking place.
When the MS receives the message, it initiates the release of the link layer connections, it
disconnects the physical channels and it initiates the lower layer connections in the new channel.
Once connections in the new channel are ready, the MS sends a Handover Complete message to
the network to indicate the handover completion. Then, the network releases the old channels.
There are some cases of abnormal HO completion. For example, if in the HO request message
the network instructs the MS to use a non-supported frequency or if a lower layer failure occurs.
In those cases the MS deactivates the new channels, reactivates the old channels and sends a
Handover Failure message. As a consequence the network releases the new channels. Therefore,
MENÚ
SALIR

4.4. SYMPTOMS: PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND ALARMS
73
problems in a cell are normally reﬂected in an increment of the following symptoms:
• Number of HO failures. On the one hand, if the downlink path suﬀers from interference,
then quality is degraded and the MS is unable to decode the Handover Command message
sent by the network. Therefore the HO never happens. On the other hand, if quality is
bad in the uplink path of the target cell, the MS will receive the Handover Command, but
the BTS will not decode the Handover Complete messages sent by the MS and, therefore,
in this case the HO will also fail.
• Number of intra-cell HOs. In bad quality conditions, if the signal level is high enough,
normally intra-cell HOs are preferred to inter-cell HOs. Thus, if quality is bad, intracell
HOs are frequently attempted.
There are diﬀerent HO algorithms, but most of them are based on level, quality and tim-
ing advance measurements. Symptoms related to HO schemes are normally measured as the
percentage of HOs of each of the following types:
• Level HO. Level HO takes place when the received signal level (RXLEV) by/from the
serving cell is below a threshold set by the operator. This situation is typical when the
MS is at the border of the serving cell.
• Quality HO. Quality HO occurs because the signal quality (RXQUAL) on the uplink or
downlink path is below a threshold set by the operator.
• Interference HO. Interference HOs are particular types of quality HOs. Interference HO
takes place when level is over a certain threshold, but quality is below another threshold.
Among these HOs, the intra-cell HOs consist on the change from a time slot to another
one within the same serving cell.
• Distance HO. Distance HO takes place when the measured TA is higher than a threshold
set by the operator. This type of HO normally occurs in rural areas, in which the MS is at
the cell border and it does not receive high signal levels from other cells. Another typical
scenarios are seaside areas, where due to the signal reﬂections onto the sea, the signal can
reach large distances and, therefore, distance HOs take place to avoid interference.
• Power budget HO. The MS continuously evaluates whether the signal levels received
from the adjacent cells are higher than the level received from the serving cell. Power
budget HO occurs when the level received from a neighboring BTS is above the level
received from the serving cell plus a margin.
HOs algorithms diﬀer from vendor to vendor and the operator can decide which HO types to
enable, as well as their parameters and priorities. For example, a given operator could have the
following priorities in its HOs: 1) Intra-cell, 2) Interference, 3) Level, 4) Distance, 5) Quality,
6) Power budget.

Access
As described in 2.1.4, the random access channel RACH is the logical channel used by the MS
to transmit a Channel Request13 message when it wants to access the network [26]. Among the
symptoms related to RACH accesses, the RACH load stands out, which is the percentage of
the total RACH capacity that is being used on average during the measurement period. This
indicator normally increases when there are problems caused by interference in the uplink path.
4.4.7
Alarms
Current network management systems provide thousands of alarms, which are triggered by
certain events. Alarms are not always an indication of a fault. For example, if network traﬃc
increases, an alarm may be triggered, which would not be a symptom of a fault. Furthermore,
a fault in a piece of equipment may aﬀect other pieces of equipment, causing their alarms to be
triggered. This is the reason why identifying the cause of a problem based only on alarms is
very diﬃcult.
Alarm correlation [109, 192, 202] is the interpretation of multiple alarms so that a new
meaning is given to the original alarms (see Chapter 2). Multiple references can be found about
alarm correlation for fault diagnosis, whereas no attention has been paid to automatic diagnosis
based on performance indicators. This thesis is focused on performance indicators because of
the previous reasons. Nevertheless, some alarms have also been included in our knowledge base
(Table 4.6), which can be directly obtained from the NMS or after an alarm correlation process.
13The number of RACH time slots between initiation of the immediate assignment procedure and the ﬁrst
Channel Request is a value drawn randomly with uniform probability distribution for each new initial assignment
initiation. After sending the Channel Request message, the MS starts listening to the BCCH waiting for the
network reply. If it does not receive any response, the MS sends a new Channel Request. The number of RACH
time slots between two successive Channel Request is also a random value from a uniform probability distribution.
The maximum number of channel requests that the MS can send is broadcasted in the BCCH. Once the last request
is transmitted, a timer starts and when it expires the immediate assignment procedure is aborted and a random
access failure is indicated.

Conditions: Features and Conﬁgurations
In this section, conditions, which are factors having an impact on the network behavior, are
described. Conditions have been divided into two groups: features and conﬁgurations (Table
4.7). Features are functionalities applied by operators in order to improve the quality in the
communications, e.g. frequency hopping. Conﬁgurations are special characteristics of certain
cells which determines the faults that may occur in those cells, e.g. cell type (rural or urban
cells).
4.5.1
Frequency Hopping
Frequency Hopping (FH) consists in changing the frequency assigned to certain communication
channel at each transmission burst. Frequency hopping occurs between time slots and, therefore,
a mobile station transmits (or receives) on a ﬁxed frequency during one time slot and then it
must hop14 before the time slot on the next TDMA frame [18].
The purpose of FH is diminishing the negative eﬀects of multipath fading and interference.
On the one hand, thanks to FH, if a frame is suﬀering from fading it is very probable that the
following frame will not be aﬀected because it will be transmitted onto a diﬀerent frequency
(frequency diversity). On the other hand, in a cell suﬀering from interference, if FH is activated
in the network, the interfering transmitter will be changing its frequencies and, therefore, at
14The beacon channel, BCCH, should be transmitted at a constant frequency, without FH. Therefore, one of
the transmitters should be reserved for that frequency. For the other transmitters, there are two types of FH:
baseband FH (BB FH) and radiofrequency FH (RF FH). In BB FH each transmitter works at a ﬁx frequency
and the successive bursts change the transmitter along the communication. In RF FH, also called synthesized
FH, each transmitter handles all bursts belonging to the same connection. Therefore, transmitters should change
their frequency from burst to burst.
Among the conﬁguration parameters related to FH are the hopping frequencies and the hopping sequence,
which is identiﬁed by the Hopping Sequence Number HSN. The HSN can take values from 0 to 63. There are
diﬀerent types of hopping sequences, the main ones are:
• Cyclic sequences. They are mainly used to diminish the eﬀects of multipath fading. The available frequen-
cies are used in consecutive order and HSN is equal to zero. For example, if the hopping group is composed
of 4 frequencies, the cyclic distribution of frequencies will be: ...f1, f2, f3, f4, f1, f2, f3, f4, f1, ....
• Random sequences. They are used to diminish the eﬀects of co-channel interference. The available se-
quences are pseudo-randomly ordered.
Specs deﬁne 63 diﬀerent sequences depending on the degree of
randomness. For example, a random sequence could be ...f3, f2, f2, f1, f1, f4, f3, f1, ....
• Orthogonal sequences. All transmitters in a cell have the same frequencies and the same hopping sequences.
An oﬀset is applied to the frequencies assigned to each transmitter so that the transmitters do not interfere,
which is determined by the parameter Mobile Allocation Index Oﬀset, MAIO. Thus, although all the
transmitters use the same sequence, channels coinciding in time do not use the same frequency.

CHAPTER 4. DIAGNOSIS IN GSM/GPRS NETWORKS
each moment the only interference will come from those transmitters whose frequencies will
coincide with the frequency of the wanted signal (interference diversity). Thus, interference
changes in each burst, which beneﬁts the connections. If FH were not used, a connection could
suﬀer interference during all the call duration. Hence, FH converts a continuous interference
into interference on isolated bursts, which can be counteracted more easily with interleaving and
coding techniques.
FH is mainly used in urban areas. In other scenarios, such as roads, fading is less probable to
occur because of two reasons. Firstly, the largest signal contribution comes from the direct ray.
Secondly, the channel characteristics change very rapidly, due to the high speed. In addition, in
urban areas tight reuse patters are normally used in order to increase capacity. The consequence
is that co-channel interference is larger in cities than in rural areas.
4.5.2
Power Control
Power Control (PC) adapts the power transmitted by both the MS and the BTS to the propaga-
tion conditions [29, 27]. This feature can be separately activated on the uplink or the downlink,
although the most common situation is that both links have activated power control15. The
aim of PC is minimizing the transmitted power while maintaining the good quality of the radio
links.
Power control algorithms are based on the level and quality measurements described in 4.4.2,
which are ﬁltered before being used by PC. Power is increased if level or quality are low, and it
is decreased in the opposite case.
The following beneﬁts are derived from the use of PC:
• Increase in the MS battery duration.
• Decrease of the saturation risk in the receiver. When a MS is very close to the BTS, if PC
was not used the high signal level could saturate either the MS or BTS receiver.
• Interference reduction if all MSs and BTSs in the network use PC.
• Quality improvement, because if a bad quality is measured, the transmitted power is
increased.
4.5.3
Discontinuous Transmission
Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) [17] is a mechanism which allows the radio transmitters to
be switched oﬀmost of the time during speech pauses16. DTX has the following two purposes:
to save power in the MS and to reduce the overall interference level.
15In the BCCH carrier power control is not applied and the BTS should always transmit at the maximum power
set for that cell.
16A basic problem when using DTX is that the background acoustic noise, which is transmitted together with
the speech, would disappear when the radio transmission was cut, resulting in a modulation of the background
noise. Since the DTX switching can take place rapidly, it has been found that this eﬀect can be very annoying
for the listener. The way to overcome this problem is generating on the receiver side synthetic noise similar to
the transmitter side background noise, which is called confort noise [16]. The parameters of this comfort noise
are estimated on the transmitter and send to the receiver before the radio transmission is cut and at a regular

4.5.4
Reception diversity
One of the most commonly applied techniques to ﬁght against the eﬀects of multipath fading is
reception diversity. It is based on receiving several poorly correlated signals, in such a manner
that the probability of both signal fading simultaneously is negligible.
Currently, the most frequently used diversity method in base stations is space diversity,
which utilizes two reception antennas conveniently separated. Another technique to implement
diversity is by means of polarization diversity, which uses a single receiving antenna with double
polarization. The received signal is obtained either by combining the outputs of each reception
chain17 or by selecting one of the outputs.
4.5.5
Cell type
Three types of cells have been distinguished, low, normal or dense, depending on the population
density on that cell.
Certain characteristics related to each type of cell have an impact on
their associated faults. For example, cells whose “Cell Type” is low are normally large cells.
Furthermore, dropped calls in large cells are usually caused by a lack of coverage.
On the
contrary, normally the cell size is small for cells whose “Cell Type” is dense. In addition, in
small size cells failures are commonly caused by interference.
Factors related to the “Cell Type” which aﬀects the network performance are the directivities
of the antennas, the reuse factor and the cell size:
• Antenna directivity. In order to diminish interference and, therefore, increase network
capacity, sectorization is used. Sectorization divides a cell with an omnidirectional antenna
in sectors, each sector with a directive antenna.
• Reuse factor. Frequency reuse in cellular networks allows to increase the network ca-
pacity. Nevertheless, it is required to maintain a distance between co-channel cells due to
potential interference problems. The reuse factor indicates the number of cells in a cluster,
i.e. in a group of cells where the frequencies belonging to an operator can only be assigned
to one cell. Normally, the reuse factor is expressed as x/y, where x is the reuse factor per
base station (i.e. per site) and y is the reuse factor per cell. For example, a reuse factor of
3/9 consists of tri-sectorized sites and each frequency is used only once every three sites,
i.e. every 9 cells. In the case of a reuse factor 3/3 each frequency is used only once every 3
sites, which are omnidirectional. For a given cell size, the lower the reuse factor, the lower
the co-channel distance, and therefore, the lower the ratio C
I is.
low rate afterwards. This allows the comfort noise to adapt to the changes of the noise on the transmitter side.
The comfort noise parameters are encoded into a special frame, called SID (Silence Descriptor) frame. When the
transmitter detects no speech, it sends a SID frame and transmission stops. Until no speech is detected again,
8 SID frames are sent in each SACCH multiframe. When DTX is activated, during the silence intervals the
measurements used for the handover and power control algorithms are the SUB measurements, whereas during
conversation FULL measurements are utilized.
17Combiners are designed so that input signals are coherently mixed.

• Cell size.
Reduction of the cell size is a method often used to increase the network
capacity. In any network, diﬀerent cell sizes coexist: small cells in areas with high traﬃc
density and large cells in areas with low traﬃc density. Depending on their size, cells can
be classiﬁed into the groups shown in Table 4.8 [162, 25].
Two completely diﬀerent scenarios can be distinguished, rural or urban areas, which deter-
mines the network design, and therefore, the value of the three parameters described above.
Typical characteristics of urban and rural areas are presented in Table 4.9. For cells located in
rural areas, “Cell Type” will be low, whereas for cells in highly populated urban areas, “Cell
Type” will be dense. “Cell Type” will be normal for cells in areas whose characteristics are in
the middle of the other two types.
4.5.6
Climate
The climate may have an impact on the faults occurring in the cells. For example, in moist
climates where rain is frequent, the probability of hardware faults increases. This is due to the
fact that water can easily get into a piece of equipment or some connections may come loose.
This also has an impact on the quality of transmission links, if microwave radio are used in the
A-bis links. The Conﬁguration denoted as “Climate” may take on the values wet, normal or
dry.

4.5.7
Antenna alignment and tilt
“Antenna alignment” has a direct impact on the network performance. If the antenna is mis-
aligned dropped calls may happen because of two main reasons. On the one hand, the signal
level may be too low in some areas, causing dropped calls in the serving cell. On the other hand,
interference from the cell may cause dropped calls in other cells.
Another conﬁguration parameter is the “antenna tilt”.
If the antenna is downtilted too
much, dropped calls may show up because of lack of coverage in the border areas. If the tilt is
not enough, dropped calls may appear in the serving cell because of excessive timing advance
and also interference may cause dropped calls in other cells.
4.6
Knowledge base for diagnosis model
In this section, the knowledge base for diagnosis in the RAN of GSM networks is summarized.
The knowledge base is composed of three types of elements: causes, symptoms and conditions.
Table 4.1 showed the causes considered for the model, whereas conditions were enumerated
in Table 4.7.
In order to simplify the model, subcauses have not been diﬀerentiated.
For
example, the cause “UL interference” can be caused by several reasons (wrong frequency plan,
intermodulation, etc.). A more complex model should distinguish among those faults.
In the case of the symptoms, KPIs have been calculated as percentages of samples (=mea-
surements) complying with a given condition during the measurement period (e.g. a day, busy
hour, etc.). An example of symptom is the percentage of samples with RXQUAL=1 to 7. If
this KPI is high, it indicates bad quality. This approach follows the method used by network
operators to calculate KPIs used for diagnosis. Table 4.10 shows the symptoms considered in
the model, together with the code and the number per symptom used along this thesis.
Once the elements are deﬁned, the following step is specifying the relationships among them.
Firstly, conditions have an impact on certain causes. Secondly, each cause is related to some
symptoms. Table 4.11 presents conditions and symptoms related to each of the causes. Symp-
toms have been deﬁned so that their values increase when any of the related causes is present.
It should be pointed out that the symptoms for each cause in Table 4.11 are the most important
ones. However, other symptoms may also vary their value when the cause occur. For exam-
ple, although the lack of coverage decreases the quality, symptoms related to RXQUAL are not
shown in the table because the impact of coverage on other symptoms is much higher. The fol-
lowing section presents some examples of causes and the corresponding values of the symptoms
in a live GSM/GPRS network.
4.6.1
Example of symptom values
In order to illustrate the concepts explained in the present chapter, in this section some real
cases from a live GSM/GPRS network are presented. In Fig.4.5, the values of some symptoms
are shown for four faulty cells. The heading of each graphic is the cause diagnosed by experts

in troubleshooting. Parts of the bars have been drawn in dark if a failure occurs (i.e. the value
for that symptom is abnormal, according to thresholds deﬁned by experts).
The ﬁrst example in Fig.4.5(a) is a cell suﬀering from lack of coverage. It can be noticed
that the percentage of dropped calls due to radio failures is high (1). The received signal level
is lower in the uplink than in the downlink (2), although in both links an appreciable reduction
in the received power is observed (3-4). Quality is specially bad in the DL (5) and, therefore,
DL quality HOs are also high (6). Nevertheless, we would expect level HOs also to be high, but
they are practically nonexistent (7-8). The reason may be that level HOs are very low in the
HO ranking of priorities set by the network operator. In that case, level HOs will never happen
because a quality HO will probably be triggered beforehand.
The cell in the second example (Fig.4.5(b)) suﬀered from interference in the uplink path.
The percentage of dropped calls due to radio failures is high (1), as expected. The percentage of
samples with bad quality in the uplink path is also high, although not excessive to be considered
serious (2). In addition, the number of samples in the UL suﬀering from bad quality whose level
is high is considerable (3). Another consequence of the interference problem is that the number
of HOs due to bad quality and interference in the uplink rises (4-5). It can also be appreciated
that the interference measured on the idle slots in the uplink is quite high (6). The RACH load
also goes up due to the interference (7).
The third example (Fig.4.5(c)) presents symptoms for a cell with a HW fault in the trans-
mission part. The dropped calls due to radio failures are high (1). Quality in the DL path is
bad (2) and worse than quality in the UL path (3). The share of quality HOs, especially DL
quality HOs (4), is high. Signal levels both in the UL and DL has gone down (5-6). Reduced
level in the UL may indicate that diagnosis asserted by experts was wrong because the fault was
not only in the transmission path, but common to transmitter and receiver. It may be possible
that the problem was due to a faulty TRX, which would also explained the increased number
of LAPD failures (7). Alarms should be examined in order to achieve a conclusive diagnostic.
The last example (Fig.4.5(d)) presents the symptoms for a cell with a fault in the A-bis
interface. The main symptom is the indicator of the increased number of dropped calls due to
A-bis failures (1).

Clariﬁcations:
• Interference:
Symptoms: Interference may show up in the uplink path, in the downlink path or in both links. Many
samples in the interfered link present high signal level but bad quality. The implication is that, although
the received signal level from the serving cell is enough, interference is considerable. Therefore, C
I ratio is
reduced and, consequently, quality is degraded. Quality has been measured as the share of samples out of
RXQUAL band 0.
Conditions: If the features FH, power control or DTX are activated, it is less probable that the cause of
problems is interference than if those features are not active. Furthermore, if traﬃc density is low (rural
areas) it is less probable that the cause of problems is interference than if the traﬃc density is high (urban
areas).
MENÚ
SALIR

88
CHAPTER 4. DIAGNOSIS IN GSM/GPRS NETWORKS
• Lack of coverage:
Symptoms: Lack of coverage, either at the cell borders or at shadow areas, reduces the signal level and
quality. Normally the limiting path in this type of fault is the uplink. If the lack of coverage is taking
place at the cell borders, probably the cell will be large and, therefore, the average distance between the
MSs and the BTS will be high. On the contrary, if the lack of coverage is due to shadow areas, probably
the average distance between the MSs and the BTS will be small.
Conditions: Lack of coverage at the borders is common in rural cells. On the other hand, shadow areas
normally appear in urban areas because of the presence of obstacles, indoors, etc. If a visual inspection
of the antenna shows that it is misaligned, it is very probable that the cause of the problems is lack of
coverage. Similarly, if the antenna downtilt is excessive, probably the cause of the problems is lack of
coverage at the borders.
• Excessive TA
Symptoms: If too many calls are dropped because of the excessive distance, the percentage of MSs located
at far distances from the BTS (and consequently with high values of TA) is probably high.
Conditions: If the antenna is not downtilted enough, it is probable that the signal reaches more than 35
Km. The “Cell Type” is also related to this cause because this type of fault is more frequent in rural cells.
• TRXn: Baseband Unit:
Symptoms: Depending on whether the fault is related with the reception or the transmission path, the
share of samples with bad quality in the uplink or in the downlink, respectively, rises. When there is a
TRX fault, the percentage of samples in RXQUAL bands 5, 6 or 7 in the uplink for the faulty TRX goes
up. The quality distribution per band is diﬀerent in the case of interference fault compared to TRX fault.
Whereas if the problem is caused by interference the percentages of samples in each upper band increase
in a similar way, when there is a TRX fault, the percentage of samples rises mainly in one single band.
• TRXn: general fault: This type of TRX fault is any fault in a TRX not related only with the baseband
unit.
Symptoms: The transmitted signal level decreases because of the reduction in the output signal of the
faulty TRX. As a consequence, the signal level is normally higher in the uplink than in the downlink path.
In addition, the quality in the downlink or uplink path worsens, due to a fault in the transmitter or the
receiver part, respectively, of the TRX.
• Transmission and reception path:
Conditions: These faults are more frequent in areas with hard weather, e.g. places where rain is abundant
and frequent.
• Fading:
Conditions: If FH is activated or reception diversity is implemented, the probability of fading diminishes.
Furthermore, it is more probable that fading happens in urban cells than in rural cells because in the
former case, speed is slower and obstacles which cause multipath are more numerous.
• Conﬁguration parameters:
Symptoms: Symptoms for this cause can diﬀer a lot, depending on the type of parameter that is erroneous.
The most common failures are the ones in the table above.

4.A
Appendix: Case Study
In order to illustrate the concepts explained in the present chapter, in this appendix some
practical troubleshooting cases from a live GSM/GPRS will be described [14]. These are specially
complex cases where the ultimate cause of the problem was determined by TS experts. The
diagnosis model proposed in the present chapter only includes “high level” causes.
Hence,
subcauses should also be considered in the model in order to use it for the cases presented
hereafter.
For example, according to the proposed model, Case 1 (Section 4.A.1) would be
diagnosed as “UL interference”. In order to diagnose the ultimate cause of the interference, i.e.
the antenna back lobes were large, a more complex model would be required.
4.A.1
Case 1: UL Interference
Problem description
DCR is very high on sector 1 of a tri-sectorial site. The antennas are located on a high building
in the middle of a big city. The antenna of sector 1 is higher than the others. Baseband FH
is being used. The distance between macrocells in this area is less than 1 Km and all cells are
handling very high traﬃc levels (5 or 6 TRX per cell). There are around 15 or 20 microcells or
picocells below those macrocells carrying also a high traﬃc load.
Diagnosis actions
Uplink interference on idle time slot was very high, which in principle pinpointed to an interfer-
ence fault.
A technician went to check the site and no hardware problems were found. A controller
revised the alarms, but no important ones were triggered.
Troubleshooting experts checked the frequency plan in order to investigate whether the
problem could be caused by interference. It was found that too many frequencies were involved.
Therefore, some ﬁne tuning trials were implemented, but the situation did not improve.
BB FH was deactivated in order to have statistics per TRX, but no TRX speciﬁc fault was
found.
A technician went back to the site to measure UL interference and it was concluded that
the interference was coming from MSs on other cells. Furthermore, the interference was coming
from the back lobe of the antenna.
Solution
The problem was due to the fact that the antenna on sector 1 was not directional enough. Thus,
the side and back antenna lobes were picking up UL signals from MSs on cells behind.
It was decided to reduce the side and back lobes of the antenna by replacing it by other
antenna (Fig.4.6(a)) or moving it down on the roof (Fig.4.6(b)), so that the building could act
as a screen. After implementing the ﬁrst solution, the UL interference and DCR went down.

Case 2: HW fault in reception path
Problem description
The DCR increases intermittently in a cell located in the middle of a medium size city. At the
beginning, the problem only showed up one or two days a week. After a while, dropped calls
occurred on more days of the week, and ﬁnally it has become a permanent problem. There is
only an omni-directional antenna, which is used to transmit and receive. There are 6 TRXs and
BB FH is used. No reception diversity is applied.
Diagnosis actions
Uplink interference on idle time slot was very high, coinciding in time of the periods with high
DCR. In principle, this pinpointed to an interference fault.
A technician went to check the site and no hardware problems were found. A controller
checked the alarms, but no important ones were triggered. Troubleshooting experts checked the
frequency plan and they concluded that there were no problems with it.
BB FH was deactivated in order to have statistics per TRX, but no fault was found.
A technician went back to the site to measure UL interference and no unusual levels were
measured. Some pieces of equipment were changed, including the antenna, but the problem
remained.
The BTS power was decreased while monitoring the UL interference. It could be observed
that after a certain threshold, the interference disappeared. A new duplexer was installed, but
the interference was still there. The conclusion was that the interference source was located in
the feeder, as the antenna was already replaced. The cable was replaced, achieving no better
results. Finally, the lightning protector18 was replaced and interference disappeared.
18A lightning protector is a device designed to divert large surges of current, such as a lightning strike, from
reaching the RF equipment

Solution
The problem was that there were leakages in the lightning protector to the ground when a lot of
power and traﬃc was involved. As a result, some part of the transmitted energy was going to the
ground and, after being reﬂected, going back to the BTS. Although the duplexer was attenuating
the signal, still high power was arriving at the receiver LNA, causing intermodulation, which
produced UL interference.
4.A.3
Case 3: Adjacency deﬁnition and Congestion
Problem description
The scenario for Case 3 is shown in Fig.4.7. Cell A is presenting a high DCR. Cell G is serving
both a motorway and a business park. During busy hours the congestion in cell G is high.
Diagnosis actions
Cell A and D suﬀered from high HO Failure rates. Among the HO causes, level and quality
HOs stood out .
The frequency plan was checked and it was observed that the problem existed since there
had been a frequency change in an area nearby. Although D and J are cochannels, they do not
show interference.
After checking the conﬁguration parameters, it was found that the BCC19 of cell D and J
were the same one. The problem can be described as follows: A MS served by cell A driving in
the direction of the business park tries to handover to cell G. However, cell G is congested. As
the MS do not receive any strong signal from the other neighboring cells, the call is dropped due
to lack of coverage. If case the call survives, the MS may catch the signal from cell J, which has
the same frequency and BCC as cell D (cell J is not deﬁned as adjacent of cell A). The BSC
sends a HO Command expecting the MS to go to cell D. As the HO can not take place, the
Failure Rate metrics rise in both A and D. After the unsuccessful HO attempt, the MS returns
to cell A. Soon the lack of coverage makes the call drop and the RF dcr counter increases. In
case the MS is dropped while coming back to cell A, the counter RF HO dcr is increased.

between cells using the same frequencies.

Solution
After the BCC of cell D or J was changed, HO F of cell D became normal. Although HO F
on cell A also improved, due to the blocking of cell G, the value was still not good enough.
Furthermore, DCR in cell A was still very high.
A new adjacency deﬁnition was added between cell A and J, which allows direct HO from
A to J if cell G is congested. DCR improved, although it was still not good enough.
In order to completely solve the problem, cell G would need capacity extension (more TRXs)
or a separate cell should be implemented to serve the business park.
4.A.4
Case 4: Adjacency deﬁnition, Conﬁguration parameters and Interfer-
ence
Problem description
Dropped calls are detected in a motorway (Fig.4.8). The average speed on the motorway is
around 100 Km/hour.
Diagnosis actions
The problem occurred since a new site (site B), which also serves on the motorway, was added.
B1 presented high DCR and high HO F. However, that sector was not supposed to serve on the
motorway. On cells A2, B2 and B3, the HO F was also high.
From some drive tests it was found that when going east, HOs were happening from A2 to
B1 around 30% of the time, instead of handing to B2 or B3. B3 was normally missed because
MSs were moving very fast. Furthermore, due to reﬂections from the surrounding buildings, B1
was dominant in some points of the motorway. C3 was not deﬁned as neighbor of B1, therefore
although the received signal from C3 was high enough, the calls were dropped due to a lack of
coverage.
Driving west, HOs from C3 to B1 were happening around 30% of the time. In those cases,
quality diminished and ﬁnally calls were dropped. The reason was that B1 suﬀered from adjacent
channel interference from cell A3.
MENÚ
SALIR

Solution
B1 antenna was downtilted so that the cell was not dominant on the motorway. C3 was added
as neighbor to B1. Finally, HO margins were also changed.

Case 5: DL Interference
Problem description
Cell C is showing high DCR. It is covering part of a suburban area including a road crossing.
Diagnosis actions
DL quality was worse than that of other cells in the area, whereas UL quality was similar to
that of other cells in the area.
Signal level received from cell C at the road crossing was around -85 dBm.
Drive tests
conﬁrmed that most drops happened at the road crossing.
Frequency plan was investigated and no issues were found.
At the building in the upper right side of the road crossing there was a site B owned by
another operator.
The signal received from B was around -35 dBm.
The 50 dB diﬀerence
between the serving level and the interfering level was too much and, therefore, MSs in cell C
were suﬀering from interference.
Solution
A higher signal level was provided at the road crossing so that the signal diﬀerence got lower
than the current 50 dB. However, the best solution would be adding a new site close to the road
crossing.
4.A.6
Summary
In this appendix, some typical faults encountered in routine operation of real networks have been
presented. The case studies have shown that TS normally consists of “try and error” procedures,
e.g. something is changed, such as a piece of equipment or a conﬁguration parameter, and then
it is checked whether that action solved the problem. Very often, it is not clear how to identify
the fault cause, which makes it impossible to deploy TS as a series of checking routines. Hence,
an automatic tool which takes into account the uncertainty inherent to TS becomes essential to
reduce operational expenditure.

Bayesian modelling of fault diagnosis
This chapter proposes diﬀerent diagnosis systems, which answer two important questions: i)
how to represent the knowledge base explained in Chapter 4; ii) how to assess which is the cause
of the problems, based on the known values of some symptoms and conditions.
Section 5.1 presents some concepts used in this chapter and the main elements of all the
systems described in the following sections. Section 5.2 proposes a diagnosis system based on a
Bayesian classiﬁer. The systems presented in sections 5.3-5.6 are based on Bayesian Networks.
The main problems faced when building a model based on BNs are summarized in Section 5.3
and they are further explained in subsequent sections. In Section 5.4, the structure of the BN is
described. In Section 5.5, some algorithms to learn the parameters of the model from training
data are proposed.
In Section 5.6, two methods to diminish the diagnosis errors when the
model parameters are inaccurate are explained. Finally, Section 5.7 explains how to build the
diagnosis systems based on the knowledge from experts in troubleshooting, i.e. how to convert
the knowledge base presented in Chapter 4 into the diagnosis systems proposed in the present
chapter.
5.1
Introduction
5.1.1
Deﬁnitions
Two components of diagnosis systems have been distinguished: the model and the inference
method.
The model is a representation of how the “world works” in the area under study.
Ideally, the model should summarize the behavior of the RAN of cellular networks. However,
when the model is built by human experts, it represents the knowledge about the application
domain, i.e. the knowledge of troubleshooting experts about how the identiﬁcation of faults
should be done (Fig.5.1). Hence, any model is inevitably a simpliﬁcation of what the expert
knows, which is itself a simpliﬁcation of reality. Logically, it is not feasible to consider all possible
situations that may occur and there is always a trade-oﬀbetween accuracy and manageability
of the model.
There are two aspects involved in the model construction: the information about the appli-

cation domain contained in the model and the model representation. The ﬁrst item, also called
knowledge base, was presented in Chapter 4. In the present chapter the model representation
will be described for diﬀerent diagnosis systems.
The inference method is the algorithm that identiﬁes the cause of the problems based on the
available evidence (e.g. symptoms). For example, an inference method would be the reasoning
followed by a doctor to say, after observing that a patient has fever and he coughes, that he has
ﬂu. All inference methods presented in this thesis are based on the Bayes’ rule.
According to the knowledge base explained in Chapter 4, all the diagnosis models should be
composed of the following elements: causes, symptoms and conditions. The causes represent
the possible faults that may be producing problems in the network. The symptoms represent
manifestations of the causes. Finally, the conditions represent factors that have to be taken into
account in order to properly identify the cause. These elements have been modelled as random
variables. The inherent continuous nature of performance indicators has been one of the main
diﬃculties found in the development of this thesis. One of the diﬀerences between the models
in the following sections is whether performance indicators have been modelled as continuous or
discrete variables. In the later case, a discretization method has been required.
Models should also deﬁne the relationships among the variables. In the bayesian approach
adopted in this thesis, those relations are speciﬁed by means of joint probability density func-
tions.
In summary, deﬁnition of models should include the following information:

• Elements (causes, symptoms and conditions), that is the knowledge base.
• Random variables that model the previous elements. In the case of discrete random vari-
ables which model continuous elements, the discretization method should also be deﬁned.
• Joint probability density functions, which stand for the relationship among random vari-
ables
The ﬁrst point is the same one for all models and it was covered in Chapter 4. Furthermore,
the random variables used for causes, conditions and alarms are the same for all models. How-
ever, the type of random variables used to model performance indicators and the assumptions
adopted to deﬁne the joint pdfs are diﬀerent for each model presented in the following sections.
In order to simplify, causes have been modelled as binary discrete random variables. There-
fore, it will be assumed that a cause is a random variable with two possible values: 0(no),
1(yes), related to the absence or presence of the cause, respectively. Causes considered in the
model are the ones in Table 4.1. A more realistic model would consider causes as continuous
variables, depending on the degree of seriousness of the fault. An intermediate solution would
be to discretize causes into a limited number of states, e.g. very serious, serious, acceptable,
slight, non-existent.
Conditions have also been represented as discrete random variables because conditions
included in the model have a limited number of states. For example, the condition representing
FH can take the values 1 or 0, depending on whether this functionality is activated in the network
or not. Conditions considered in the model are shown in Table 5.1. The table also shows the
states of the conditions and the possible values of the corresponding random variables.
Alarms have been modelled as binary random variables, whose possible values are 0 or 1,
corresponding to the states oﬀor on, respectively. Alarms were enumerated in Table 4.6.
Performance indicators were shown in Table 4.10. They can adopt continuous values in
the range [0−100]% (except symptoms 13 and 14, which can go from -200 to 200 % and symptom
17, which is in the range [0 −200]%). Performance indicators are continuous random variables
in the model presented in Section 5.2, whereas they are discretized in the models described in
sections 5.3-5.6.

Notation
The number of states of random variable Xi is denoted by |Xi|. The states of a variable Xi are
{xi,1, ..., xi,|Xi|}. The symbol xi is used to represent any value of Xi, xi = xi,j, j ∈{1, ..., |Xi|}.
Evidence E = {X1 = x1, ..., XP = xP } is an assignment of values to P variables. The value of a
variable Xi in assignment E is denoted by xE
i . Variables can be causes, symptoms or conditions.
C = {C1, ..., CK} is the set of causes. When all causes are modelled as a single random
variable, the variable is called C and its states, {c1, ..., cK}, are the diﬀerent causes. When
diﬀerent random variables are distinguished for each cause, they are called C1, ..., CK and their
states are no/yes. In both cases, in order to refer to any of the causes, the notation c will be
used.
S = {S1, ..., SM} is the set of symptoms.
The states of symptom Si are {si,1, ..., si,Qi}.
O = {O1, ..., OL} is the set of conditions. The states of condition Oi are {oi,1, ..., oi,Hi}.
XC
i is a continuous symptom which has been discretized into the discrete symptom Xi. The
interval limits (thresholds) of XC
i
used in the discretization are {ti,1, ..., ti,Ti}. Probability of a
variable Xi taking a value xi,j is denoted by P(Xi = xi,j) = P(xi,j).
A case is a set of values for some symptoms and conditions. A case can also include the
real cause, c.
D is a set of N cases, with the mth case given by the (P + 1)-tuple x(m) =
{c(m), x(m)

The complementary set of A ⊂U is B = U\A.
5.2
Model based on Bayesian Classiﬁer
Classiﬁcation, which is a basic task in data analysis, is the action of assigning an unlabelled
example (described by a set of attributes) to a class. A classiﬁer is the algorithm that carries
out the classiﬁcation. The class label is the name identifying the class.
Diagnosis can be considered as a classiﬁcation problem typical in machine learning applica-
tions [140], where the classes would be the causes and the attributes would be the symptoms.
One of the most eﬀective classiﬁers, in the sense that its performance is competitive with state-
of-the-art classiﬁers, while being very simple, is the Naive Bayesian Classiﬁer (BC). It
has proven to be eﬀective in many practical applications, including text classiﬁcation, medical
diagnosis, and system performance management [165].
Because of the previous reasons, the ﬁst diagnosis system for the RAN of cellular networks
proposed in this thesis is based on a BC [46]. In Section 5.2.1 the inference method for the BC
will be described. In Section 5.2.2 the known beta pdf will be revised. Then, the model, which
is based on beta pdfs, will be presented in Section 5.2.3.
5.2.1
Inference Method
The purpose of a classiﬁer is to predict the value of a discrete class variable C, based on the known
values of a set of attributes S = {S1, ..., SM}. The possible values of the class, C = {c1, ..., cK},
are the diﬀerent causes. The attributes are the symptoms, which are modelled as continuous

random variables. Let’s consider a case E(m) = {S1 = s(m)
1
, ..., SM = s(m)
M }, composed of the
values for each of the M symptoms (or a subset of the M symptoms).
In order to statistically deﬁne the model completely, the joint pdf of the random variables in
the model would be required. This task becomes unaﬀordable if the number of variables is large
and the set of training cases is scarce. The BC simpliﬁes the design of the model by means of
the following assumptions:
1. Only one cause is present at a time (due to the fact that a single variable is used to model
all causes)
2. Symptoms are independent of conditions given the cause.
3. Symptoms are independent given the cause.
In mobile networks, the ﬁrst two assumptions are reasonable because they are true in most
cases. The third assumption, the independence of symptoms given the cause, is often unreal-
istic in GSM networks. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that even if strong attribute
dependencies exist the BC performs very well [165, 74, 82]. Furthermore, the BC has many
advantages, such as its simplicity, learning and classiﬁcation speed.
A classiﬁer takes a case E(m), it computes a set of discriminant functions of the case, f(m)
i
, i =
1, ..., K, one for each class, and it assigns the case to the class whose function is maximum. For
the BC the discriminant functions are

given class ci. In other words, the BC ﬁnds the
maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) class given the attributes.
This classiﬁer can be derived from Bayes’ theorem if it is assumed that the attributes are
independent given the class. In that case

where E(m) is a vector of evidence for M symptoms, O(m) is a vector of evidence for L conditions,
a is a constant and some conditional probabilities have been substituted by probability density
functions because most symptoms are continuous.
The cause with the highest posterior probability is assumed to be the one that is causing
the high number of dropped calls in a cell. Therefore, the inference method for this diagnosis
system consists of calculating the fault cause as
max
ci [P(ci|E(m), O(m))]
(5.4)
In order to apply (5.4) the probability of causes given conditions and the pdfs of symp-
toms given causes are required. Therefore, deﬁning the model for diagnosis means specifying
the qualitative part (causes, symptoms and conditions) and the quantitative part (probability
functions). On the one hand, the qualitative part can be easily provided by experts. On the
other hand, the probabilities can be estimated from a database of labelled examples. However,
in most cases the amount of data available is very limited and calculating the conditional pdfs is
not possible, especially if nothing is previously known about them. This has been tackled in the
bibliography by discretizing the continuous attributes or assuming that the pdfs are gaussian
[75, 80]. In Section 5.2.3 the model for diagnosis will be presented and it will be shown that, due
to the characteristics of the symptoms, the deﬁnition of the conditional pdfs consists of setting
some parameters for a known distribution, which will be introduced in the following section.
5.2.2
Beta distribution
Firstly, attention should be drawn to two known distributions: Bernoulli and beta distributions:
• Let’s suppose an experiment whose outcome can be either success (1) or failure (0). It
is said that a random variable X, related to the previous experiment, follows a Bernoulli
distribution with parameter β (0 ≤β ≤1) if X can take only the values 0 and 1 with
probabilities 1 −β and β, respectively.
• A beta random variable1 with parameters (a, b) has the following probability density func-
1A Bernoulli experiment, with probability of success β, is repeated n times, obtaining k successes.
Let’s
suppose that β is a random variable and f(β) its probability density function. Let θ be the event “obtaining k
successes”. The probability of θ is P(θ|β) = βk(1 −β)n−k. Applying Bayes’theorem:
f(β|θ) =
βk(1 −β)n−kf(β)
R 1
0 βk(1 −β)n−kf(β)dβ
(5.5)
Assuming that β is uniform in the interval (0,1), the previous equation becomes [155]:
f(β|θ) =
(n + 1)!
k!(n −k)!pk(1 −p)n−k
(5.6)
If this equation is generalized and n and k can be not only integers, but also real numbers, then this function
is known as beta density function.

tion:
f(x) = Γ(a + b)
Γ(a)Γ(b) xa−1(1 −x)b−1 , 0 ≤x ≤1
(5.7)
where a and b are positive real numbers and Γ(x) is the gamma function:
Γ(t) =
Z ∞
0
xt−1e−xdx
(5.8)
The mean and variance of the beta function are
µ =
a
a + b
σ2 =
ab
(a + b)2(a + b + 1)
(5.9)
The uniform distribution is a special case of the beta distribution when a = b = 1.
The Bernoulli and beta distributions are related as will be explained hereafter. Let x1, ..., xn
be a random sample from a Bernoulli distribution for which the value of the parameter β
is unknown (0 < β < 1). Suppose that the prior distribution of β is a beta distribution with
parameters a and b. Then the posterior distribution of β, given that the random sample x1, ..., xn
is observed, is a beta distribution with parameters a + y and b + n −y, y = Pn
i=1 xi [70, 156].
That is, if the prior distribution of β is a beta distribution, then the posterior distribution at
each stage of sampling will also be a beta distribution, regardless of the observed values in the
sample.
An application of the previous theorem is given in the following example [70]. Suppose that
the proportion θ of defective items in a large shipment is unknown; that the prior distribution of
θ is a beta distribution with parameters a and b; and that n items are selected one at a time at
random from the shipment and inspected. If the ﬁrst inspected item is defective, the posterior
distribution of θ will be a beta distribution with parameters a + 1 and b. If the ﬁrst item is not
defective, the posterior distribution will be a beta distribution with parameters a and b + 1.
Beta pdfs have a long tradition representing prior beliefs concerning a relative frequency, e.g.
in medical diagnosis [156]. Diﬀerent arguments to support the use of the beta pdfs for priors
can be found in the bibliography. First, if a uniform pdf (or more generally, a beta pdf) is used
to represent prior beliefs, after some data is known the posterior density function is also beta.
The second argument was given in [203]: if certain assumptions about an individual’s belief
are made, then that individual must use the beta density function to quantify any prior belief
about a relative frequency. The demonstration was done for the Dirichlet distribution, which is
a generalization of the beta distribution to the case of more than two alternatives.
If we assume that our prior belief follows a beta pdf, there are diﬀerent ways of estimating
the values of a and b. According to (5.9), the ratio between a and b determines the mean, e.g.
when a is large compared to b, the mean will be close to 1. On the other hand, for ﬁxed mean
the sum of a and b determines the spread of the distribution, that is the variance. For example,
Fig.5.2 shows beta pdfs for diﬀerent values of the parameters a and b.

Model Representation
In the diagnosis system based on the BC, performance indicators have been modelled as contin-
uous random variables. Furthermore, as explained in 5.2.1, the quantitative part of the model
is composed of the following probabilities:
1. Probability of each cause given that there is a problem (high DCR) and given the condi-
tions. The probabilities of the causes are not required for all the possible combinations of
conditions because normally only some of them are possible.
2. Probability density functions of the symptoms given each cause.
The ﬁrst probabilities can easily be elicited by experts in troubleshooting. In the second
group of probabilities the two types of symptoms (performance indicators and alarms) should
be distinguished. Firstly, the pdf for an alarm given the causes is reduced to the probability of
the alarm being active given each cause, which, if the number of considered alarms in the model
is low, can also be obtained from the experts’ knowledge. Nevertheless, deﬁning the conditional
pdfs for the performance indicators is much more complex because these symptoms are mod-
elled as continuous variables. Therefore, either experts should specify the pdfs or performance
indicators should be discretized so that probabilities are more easily elicited by experts.
However, there is an alternative solution: if the symptoms followed a known pdf, deﬁning
the pdf would become a parameter estimation problem. In order to ﬁnd an appropriate known
pdf for the symptoms, one could consider how the symptoms related to performance indicators
were deﬁned: most of them can be obtained from the percentage of samples complying with a
given condition C (the special cases that do not follow this assumption will be studied below). In
other words, they are the relative frequency of one of the two possible outcomes of an experiment
(condition C achieved or not), which can be described by a Bernoulli random variable X. For

example, for the symptom “Percentage of samples in UL with RXLEV<10”, the condition
is “RXLEV<10”, therefore a random variable X with two values, 0 and 1, corresponding to
RXLEV<10 and RXLEV≥10, respectively, can be deﬁned. Then, let Y be another random
variable, having real values in the interval [0,1], representing the expert’s belief concerning the
relative frequency with which X = 1 if a cell and day is randomly chosen. The pdf of Y can be
seen as the prior belief in the β parameter of the Bernoulli distribution followed by X. In Section
5.2.2, it was explained that under these conditions the most adequate pdf is the beta pdf. The
beta pdf has previously been used to represent beliefs concerning a relative frequency [143] in
medical diagnosis [156], land cover proportions in geological models [61], frequency distributions
of solar radiation indexes [89], etc.
The conclusion is that the pdfs of most of the symptoms given the causes in the diagnosis
model can be approximated by beta pdfs [46].
Therefore, the only required information to
completely deﬁne the conditional probabilities in the model are the parameters a and b of the
beta pdfs for each pair symptom/cause. Those parameters can either be elicited by experts
[143, 148] or they can be obtained from data by means of appropriate techniques [164], e.g.
maximum likelihood estimation.
However, some symptoms in the model are not percentages of samples. Their pdfs will be
described in the following paragraphs.
Symptoms 13 and 14
Symptoms 13 and 14 in Fig.5.3, DL and UL quality link imbalance, are the diﬀerence between
two random variables which can be modelled as beta distributions (symptoms 11 and 12).
If X and Y are two independent random variables with pdfs fX and fY , respectively, then
the pdf fZ of Z = X + Y is given by the convolution of the pdfs fX and fY [70]:
fZ(x) =
Z ∞
−∞
fX(x −y)fY (y)dy
(5.10)
On the other hand, if Q = −Y , then
fQ(x) = fY (−x)
(5.11)
The pdf fS13(x) of S13 = S12 −S11 can be calculated based on (5.10) and (5.11) as
fS13(x) =
Z ∞
−∞
fS12(x + y)fS11(y)dy
(5.12)
which is the correlation of fS12 and fS11.
Taking into account that the random variables for symptoms 13 and 14 keep the relation
S13 = −S14, the pdf for symptom 14 is:
fS14(x) = fS13(−x) =
Z ∞

fS11(x + y)fS12(y)dy

Symptom 17, link imbalance, is the absolute value of the diﬀerence of two random variables,

variables has been calculated. On the other hand, it can be easily demonstrated that the pdf of
Y = |X| is:
fY (x) = fX(x) + fX(−x) ; 0 ≤x ≤∞

percentages of samples with RXQUAL in band 5, 6 or 7 in TRX number n. It can be demon-
strated that if X, Y and Z are independent random variables with pdfs fX, fY and fZ, the pdf
of W = max(X, Y, Z) is:

Models based on Bayesian Networks
Bayesian Networks (BNs) [110, 157], also called Probabilistic Belief Networks, were described in
Chapter 3. The study of inference methods for BNs is out of the scope of this thesis. Inference
methods have been widely studied in existing bibliography [110, 54, 69, 119]. Thus, eﬃcient
inference algorithms exist to obtain the probability of a certain variable given the available
evidence, and they are integrated in comercial tools for BNs.
The model representation is composed of variables (causes, symptoms and conditions) and
relations among them.
The relationships are represented as directed edges among variables
and probability density functions. The main problems encountered during model construction
have been the deﬁnition of the BN structure, the modelling of continuos symptoms and the
speciﬁcation of the probabilities in the BN:

• One of the main drawbacks of BNs is the diﬃculty in the deﬁnition of complex models.
Thus, a technique often used in order to simplify model construction is to assume a given
network structure.
That is, a certain independence between the variables is assumed.
In that way, the problem of BN deﬁnition is simpliﬁed to the speciﬁcation of the nodes
and pdfs of a given network. The beneﬁts of a simple network structure are not only
that knowledge acquisition is easier, but also that inference algorithms are simpler. The
network structures that have been selected in this thesis have taken into account that the
simplicity of the diagnosis system is a key issue in the diagnosis of cellular networks [45].
The following section will describe the diﬀerent structures adopted in this thesis for the
development of diagnosis systems for the RAN.
• For most applications, discrete BNs are normally preferred to BNs with continuous vari-
ables. The reason is the high complexity of the knowledge acquisition and inference al-
gorithms in the later case. Hence, the diagnosis systems proposed hereafter are based
on discrete BNs. Therefore, the continuous performance indicators should be discretized
before a discrete BN can be used. In Section 5.5.1 some discretization policies, either
deﬁned by troubleshooting experts or obtained based on training classiﬁed examples, will
be presented.
Furthermore, some novel methods which combine human expertise and
information from previous cases will also be proposed.
• Once continuous variables have been discretized, the deﬁnition of the continuous pdfs in
the BN is converted into the speciﬁcation of probability tables. Those probabilities can be
either elicited by troubleshooting experts or obtained based on training cases. Diﬀerent
methods for probability elicitation will be proposed in Section 5.5.2.
• Contrary to other application domains, such as medical diagnosis, for which repositories
of machine learning databases have been created and maintained [50], in cellular systems
there are no databases of classiﬁed cases. This is the reason why in most cases the model
MENÚ
SALIR

5.4. BAYESIAN NETWORK STRUCTURES
107
has to be based on knowledge, i.e. experts elicit the model parameters (probabilities in
the BN and thresholds for discretized variables). When the number of parameters to be
deﬁned is large, which is normally the case, inaccuracy in the parameters is unavoidable
due to multiple reasons. Firstly, experts in troubleshooting are not used to the terminology
used in BN theory. Secondly, even when experts are used to build BNs, eliciting the model
parameters is an arduous and very time-consuming task. Furthermore, cells operating in
diﬀerent environments (rural/urban, indoor/outdoor, top of building/street corner, etc.)
display diﬀerent characteristics, thus requiring diﬀerent parameters in the model. Lastly,
even similar types of cells may present diﬀerent behaviors, depending on the diﬀerent con-
ﬁguration parameters in the network (the number of conﬁguration parameters is so large
that it is not viable to model of all them in the BN). In this thesis, two methods to dimin-
ish diagnosis error of models due to inaccurate parameters are proposed. Those methods,
which have been named Smooth Bayesian Networks and Multiple Uniform Intervals, will
be described in Section 5.6.
5.4
Bayesian Network Structures
In this section, three BN structures will be proposed for the diagnosis models. It should be
noticed that mobile network operators consider that a feasible diagnosis system should be easy
to design, operate and maintain. Thus, there is a trade-oﬀbetween accuracy and simplicity of the
BN structure. The ﬁrst model is the Simple Bayes Model (SBM), which has been chosen because
of its simplicity and good performance.
The following structure, the Central Bayes Model
(CBM), is a novel modiﬁcation of the SBM. Finally, the last proposed structure, independence
of causal inﬂuence (ICI) models, is based on causal independence assumptions.
5.4.1
Simple Bayes Model (SBM)
One of the ﬁrst applications of the Simple Bayes Model, also called Naive Bayes Model, was the
diagnosis of congenital heart disease [191]. Since then, the SBM has been successfully utilized
in many applications because of its simplicity and accurate results.
Model representation
The SBM consists of a single parent node C and M children nodes S1, ..., SM (Fig.5.6). The
states of the parent node are the possible causes C = {c1, ..., cK}, whereas the children are the
symptoms, which may take any number of states. In the BNs developed in this thesis, in order
to simplify knowledge acquisition, symptoms have two or, as much, three states.
Associated to each symptom Si there is a table of conditional probabilities P(Si|C) of size
|C| × |Si|. Likewise, associated to the cause C there is a table of prior probabilities P(C) of size
|C|.
It should be pointed out that the dependencies coded by the SBM coincides with those of
the BC presented in Section 5.2. However, due to the fact that only discrete BNs have been

considered, when talking about the SBM it will be assumed that we will be referring to a discrete
SBM. In the model based on the BC the main diﬃculty was deﬁning the pdfs of symptoms,
which were continuous, given the causes. However, in the model based on the discrete SBM,
discretization of continuous symptoms and deﬁnition of probabilities are the most complex tasks.
As occurred with the BC, the following assumptions are inherent to the SBM:
• Single fault assumption, that is only a fault cause can be present at the same time. This
is due to the fact that causes are the mutually exclusive states of the node C
• Symptoms are independent given the cause. It implies that once the cause is known, infor-
mation about symptom Si is of no relevance to predict the probability of other symptom
Sj, i ̸= j
The ﬁrst assumption is reasonable because in the RAN normally one single cause is present
at a time. As stated in 5.2.3, although the second assumption is not justiﬁed in the RAN,
some studies have shown that even if strong dependencies exist among the symptoms, the SBM
provides good results [165, 74, 82].
Conditions O1, ..., OL can be modelled as children of the parent node as suggested in [173]
(Fig.5.7). This solution does not respect the causal relations among conditions and causes, which
in principle, should not be a problem. This model assumes that conditions are independent given
the causes. The problem with this representation is that knowledge acquisition is more complex,
as it will be shown in 5.7.1.
Inference method
According to the SBM, the probability of a cause ci can be easily calculated by applying the
Bayes’ rule. If some evidence is available, i.e. the value of some symptoms E(m) = {S1 =

Central Bayes Model (CBM)
Model representation
Modelling conditions as children of the parent cause, as proposed in the previous model, has
some problems. Firstly, the assumption that conditions are independent given the cause is often
incorrect. Secondly, transformation of probabilities provided by troubleshooting experts into
the required probability tables is not straightforward.
In order to overcome those problems, a structure, which has been named Central Bayes
Model (Fig.5.8) is proposed. The CBM is composed of a cause node C, whose states are the
possible causes, children nodes representing the symptoms S1, ..., SM and parent nodes of C
modelling the conditions O1, ..., OL.
Associated to the cause node C there is a probability table of size |C|
LQ
j=1
|Oj|. If the number
of conditions in the model or the number of states of condition nodes are large, the previous
probability table becomes intractable. However, normally the number of conditions included in
the model for diagnosis in the RAN is small and so is the resulting probability table.
The assumptions inherent to the SBM (single fault and symptoms independency given cause)
are still valid. Furthermore, according to the model, symptoms are independent of conditions
given the cause.
Inference method
According to the CBM, if some evidence are available, i.e. the value of some symptoms E(m) =
{S1 = s(m)

M } and conditions O(m) = {O1 = o(m)

which is the discrete version of eq.(5.3).
5.4.3
Independence of causal inﬂuence (ICI)
In order to overcome the single fault assumption inherent to the SBM and CBM, each cause
should be represented as an independent node with two states (no/yes). Fig.5.9 shows part of
a BN where multiple causes, C1, ..., CK, contribute to a common eﬀect Sj. In this model, if K
is large, the conditional probability table for symptom Sj may become intractable because it
should include the probability of the symptom for each combination of the parents’ states. For
example, if there are 10 binary causes and a binary symptom Sj, 210 probabilities should be
assessed. A more tractable model would only require the probabilities of the symptom given
each individual cause. Then, if more than a cause is present at the same time, the probability
of the symptom could be computed using some “universal” combination rule. For example, a
doctor is expected to have estimates of the chances that an individual with a given disease has
a high fever, but when he is asked to estimate the probability of high fever given some rare
combination of diseases, the doctor will probable have problems to provide a probability.
In this situation, independence of causal inﬂuence2 (ICI) assumptions [97, 180, 95] simpliﬁes
knowledge elicitation and inference. Causes are said to inﬂuence their common eﬀect indepen-
dently if individual contributions from diﬀerent causes are independent and the total inﬂuence
is a combination of the individual contributions. The number of probabilities to be deﬁned for
Sj in Fig.5.9 is linear in K when assuming ICI, whereas in an unrestricted model the number
of probabilities is exponential in K.
The dependencies in an ICI model can be represented as shown in Fig.5.10. This BN struc-
ture illustrates that the causes C1, C2, ..., CK independently contribute to the eﬀect Sj through
intermediate variables A1, A2, ..., AK and a deterministic function g. In other words, C1, ..., CK
are said to inﬂuence Sj independently if there exist random variables A1, A2, ..., AK such that
[207, 208]:
1. For all i, Ai depends on Ci and it is conditionally independent of all other Cj given Ci
2. There exists a commutative and associative function g over the domain of Sj such that
Sj = g(A1, A2, ..., AK)
Under these hypothesis, the conditional probability of the symptom Sj can be formalized as
follows:
P(Sj = sj,k|C1, ..., CK) =
X
g(A1,...,AK)=sj,k
P(A1, ..., AK|C1, ..., CK)

data are the probabilities of the intermediate variables P(Ai|Ci), i = 1, ..., K. Thus, the number
of probabilities to be speciﬁed grows linearly with K.
Example 1 (adapted from [207]). Faculty members at a university are evaluated in teaching, re-
search and management for the purpose of obtaining a salary complement. A faculty member’s salary is
decreased, maintained, increased or double increased depending on whether his performance is evaluated
unacceptable in at least one of the three areas, acceptable in all areas, excellent in one area, or excellent
in at least two areas, respectively.
Let C1, C2 and C3 be the fraction of time a faculty member spends on teaching, research and
management, respectively.
Each Ci is quantiﬁed in four states: c1 = (0 −25%), c2 = (25 −50%),
c3 = (50 −75%) and c4 = (75 −100%). The evaluation a faculty member gets in the ith area, Ai,
may take values 0, 1 or 2, depending on whether the evaluation is unacceptable, acceptable or excellent,
respectively. It is reasonable to assume that Ai is conditionally independent of other Cj’s given Ci.
Let S represent the salary complement. The variable can take values 0, 1, 2 or 3, depending on
whether the salary is decreased, maintained, increased or double increased. Then, S = g(A1, A2, A3)
where the g(.) function works as described in Table 5.2. For example, a faculty member is evaluated 2,
1 and 0 in teaching, research and management, respectively. Then, his salary will be decreased.
This example complies with ICI assumptions. In other words, the fractions of time a faculty mem-
ber spends in the three areas independently inﬂuence the salary complement result.
Thus, the only
required probabilities are the P(Ai|Ci), which sum up 24 probabilities (= 4 (states/cause)·3 (causes)·2
(states/Ai −1)). On the contrary, without ICI assumption 384 probabilities (= 43 (states/combination
of causes)·3 (causes)·2 (states/Ai −1)) would be required corresponding to each combination of possible
values of the Ci’s.

Figure 5.10: ICI model
In our application domain, modelling under ICI assumptions is carried out as follows. The
intermediate variable Ai is the symptom Sj when all causes but Ci are absent (“no” or “0”
state). With this deﬁnition, the conditional independence of Ai from Ch ∀h ̸= i is guaranteed,
as required by ﬁrst hypothesis of ICI model.
If PSj,k|Ci is the probability of symptom Sj being in state sj,k when the cause Ci is present
and the other causes are absent, then:
PSj,k|Ci = (PSj = sj,k|Ci = 1, Ch = 0 ∀h ̸= i) = P(Ai = sj,k|Ci = 1)
(5.22)
If the states of a variable Si in the BN are sorted in ascending order, k = 1, 2, ..., Qi, the
distinguished state is deﬁned as the ﬁrst state, si,1, in that list of states. For causes with two
states (no/yes), the distinguished state is the “no”(0) state. For symptoms, the distinguished
state is the value of the symptom when none of the related causes are present, i.e. the “normal”
state. It is assumed that when a cause Ci related to variable Ai is not present, Ai is in its
distinguished state. Thus, in eq.(5.21), P(Ai = sj,1|Ci = 0) = 1 and, consequently, P(Ai =
sj,k|Ci = 0) = 0 ∀k ̸= 1.
ICI can be extended to include situations where the symptom can be diﬀerent to the dis-
tinguished state even when all causes are in its distinguished state [102].
This is very use-
ful when there are possible causes of the symptom that are not explicitly modelled.
The
extension of the model consists of adding a cause C0, named leak cause, whose state is al-
ways “yes”, and its corresponding intermediate variable A0, to the BN in Fig.5.10. The back-
ground probability, PSj,k|C0 = P(A0 = sj,k|C0 = 1) = (PSj = sj,k|C0 = 1, Ch = 0 ∀h ̸= 0),
is deﬁned as the probability of the symptom in absence of all the causes that are explic-
itly modelled.
When including the leak cause in the model, the probability PSj,k|Ci is dif-
ferent to P(Ai = sj,k|Ci = 1): PSj,k|Ci is the probability of the symptom in the presence
of only a single explicit cause, Ci, taking into account that the leak cause is also present,
PSj,k|Ci = (PSj = sj,k|Ci = 1, C0 = 1, Ch = 0 ∀h ̸= 0, i). P(Ai = sj,k|Ci = 1) is the probability
of the symptom in the presence of only a single explicit cause, Ci, and considering that the leak
cause is not present, P(Ai = sj,k|Ci = 1) = (PSj = sj,k|Ci = 1, Ch = 0 ∀h ̸= i). The presence of
the leak cause is unavoidable, thus in a knowledge-based model, experts should specify PSj,k|Ci
(see Section 5.7.1).

The intermediate variables A1, ..., AK are not normally represented by nodes in the BN. On
the contrary, they are implicit in the probability table of the S node, according to eq.(5.21).
Thus, the BN structure is the one shown in Fig.5.9.
Once, the intermediate variables Ai have been deﬁned, in order to complete the ICI mod-
elling, the g(.) function should be speciﬁed. This g function represents in which way the in-
termediate variables Ai, and indirectly also the causes Ci, interact to yield a common eﬀect Sj
(condition 2 on page 110). The g function can be approximated by diﬀerent simple functions.
Some examples are the OR function (Noisy-OR model), the maximum function (Noisy-Max
model) and the addition function (Noisy-Add model). This function should be selected so that
it approximates the real combined eﬀect of the causes.
In addition, all functions should comply with: g(A1 = sj,1, ..., AK = sj,1) = sj,1, that is,
the symptom Sj is in its distinguished state, sj,1, if all the Ci are also in their distinguished
state. For example, if the causes and symptoms are binary, with states true/false, the previous
assertion implies that the symptom is false if all causes are false.
In the Noisy-OR model [157], function g is the logical OR of its inputs:
g(A1, ..., AK) = A1 OR A2 OR ... AK
(5.23)
This model assumes that causes and symptoms are binary (true/false). There exists causal
mechanisms which prevent their corresponding causes from producing the symptom Sj with a
probability qi. That is, causal mechanisms are inhibitory mechanisms. Therefore, each cause Ci
has a probability PSj,2|Ci = P(Sj = true|Ci = true) = pi = 1 −qi of producing the symptom in
the absence of all other causes.
According to eq.5.21, if the leak cause is considered, the probability of Sj given the causes
can be obtained as
P(Sj = true|C1, ..., CK) = 1 −(1 −p0)
Y
pi|Ci=true
1 −pi
1 −p0
(5.24)
where pi is the probability of Sj being “true” given that cause Ci and the leak cause are “true”
and all other causes are “false”, and p0 = PSj,2|C0 is the probability of Sj given that all causes
are “false”, except the leak cause.
In order to build the equivalent model in Fig.5.10, the probabilities of the auxiliary nodes
can be obtained as:
P(Ai = sj,2|Ci = 1) = pi −p0
1 −p0
(5.25)
The Noisy-Max model [102] is a generalization of the Noisy-OR model to deal with symp-
toms with multiple states.
Noisy-Max assumes that the resulting “degree of manifestation”
of a symptom which is related to several possible causes is the one due to the cause that has
the highest impact. States should be numbered in ascending order depending on its degree of
manifestation. The lowest state is the distinguished state.
MENÚ
SALIR

CHAPTER 5. BAYESIAN MODELLING OF FAULT DIAGNOSIS
In Noisy-Max model, function g is the maximum of its inputs:
g(A1, ..., AK) = max(A1, ..., AK)
(5.26)
When the number of states is two, the Noisy-Max model is equivalent to the Noisy-OR
model. The Noisy-Max model tends to underestimated the probabilities of symptoms given
several causes because the combined eﬀect of two causes is normally higher than the eﬀect of
any of the two causes independently.
The Noisy-Add model [93] assumes that the eﬀect of causes on the symptom is the sum of
the eﬀects caused by each cause independently. Therefore, function g is the sum of its inputs:
g(A1, ..., AK) =
K
X
i=1
Ai
(5.27)
Under this model, each Ai in Fig.5.10 can take on values ranging from 0 to n, whereas
symptom Sj can take on values ranging from 0 to K · n.
In order to avoid the number of states of Sj being larger than the number of states of the
intermediate variables Ai, other functions can be used, such as
g(A1, ..., AK) = min(n,
K
X
i=1
Ai)
(5.28)
where n es the highest state of the intermediate nodes Ai. This model has been called Noisy-
Addlim.
Another proposed function, which has been named Noisy-Addceil, is the following:
g(A1, ..., AK) = ceil( 1
K
K

(5.29)
Examples of ICI models following diﬀerent g functions can be found in the Appendix 5.A to

Model representation
The diagnosis model based on ICI assumptions is shown in Fig.5.11. In this model, each cause
Ci, i = 1..K, is modelled as a diﬀerent node, whose states are false/true. Contrary to the
SBM and the CBM, in this model causes could have more states to represent diﬀerent degrees
of occurrence of the causes.
However, for the sake of simplicity, only two states have been
considered. In addition, one important diﬀerence with regards to the previous structures is that
more than a cause can be present at the same time because causes are not mutually exclusive
states of a variable.
Symptoms S1, ..., SM are children of the causes, like in the models based on the SBM and
the CBM. The main diﬀerence is that symptoms may have multiple parents, depending on the
number of causes having a direct eﬀect on that symptom. Symptoms may have any number of

states, although in order to simplify, only symptoms with two or three states have been used for
the diagnosis system.
Diverse models have been built, which diﬀer in the conditional probability tables of symptoms
given causes. Those tables have been calculated based on diﬀerent deterministic functions g
relating the parent nodes (Noisy-OR, Noisy-Max, Noisy-Add, etc.).
Inference method
Simpliﬁed inference algorithms have been proposed for BNs based on the Noisy-OR [117, 67,
68, 208] assumption. For general BN structures, ICI has been used to transform the network
structures so that the inference in the transformed BNs is more eﬃcient than in the original
networks [93, 149, 207]. Inference algorithms are out of the scope of this thesis, thus interested
readers should go to the references.

Methods to discretize continuous variables
Most performance indicators in cellular networks are inherently continuous. Thus, they should be
discretized to build a discrete BN. In our experience of deﬁning the diagnosis models, discretiza-
tion has been found to be one of the most diﬃcult tasks because small changes in discretization
intervals lead to large variations in the diagnosis accuracy.
Most existing discretization techniques are based either on human expertise or on large
training databases. A system based only on human expertise is normally very inaccurate due
to the diﬃculties in the construction of the model. Alternatively, an adequate discretization
policy could be calculated based on a large set of labelled cases. Nevertheless, if only a scarce
number of training examples was available, applying classical discretization algorithms based on
the available data may lead to inaccurate results. Discretization based on experts’ knowledge
will be further described in Section 5.7, whereas this section is focused on discretization based
on data.

CHAPTER 5. BAYESIAN MODELLING OF FAULT DIAGNOSIS
Discretization of continuous variables based on training data has received considerable atten-
tion in machine learning literature. This thesis is centered on univariate supervised discretization
methods. Univariate methods are the simplest discretization algorithms, which search for the
best discretization of each continuous attribute individually, without considering the relation-
ships among attributes. Supervised methods utilize the class labels of the training set, in contrast
to unsupervised methods, which do not make use of the classes in the discretization process. The
idea of supervised discretization is to search for the partition of the value range of a continuous
attribute so that its power to predict the class is maximized.
Some approaches to supervised discretization measure the class entropy with respect to the
variable of interest [80, 160, 178]. Numerous studies have shown that entropy-based methods
have many advantages compared to other techniques [75, 150], such as Equal Width Interval
Binning [56] or 1R discretization [105], thus justifying their selection for diagnosis in cellular
networks.
It has been considered that one of the main ﬁgures of merit of the discretization algorithms
used for diagnosis is their simplicity. This is the reason why in the following sections symptoms
have only two states, i.e. |Si| = 2, ∀i. For each continuous symptom SC
i , the objective is to select
the “best” interval limits (thresholds) from its range of values. Thus, the discretization problem
is reduced to the deﬁnition of a single threshold, ti,1 = ti, for each symptom Si. Nevertheless,
the proposed methods can easily be extended to more states.
In this section, the words symptom, attribute and feature will be used indistinctively. Like-
wise, the class will be referring to the cause of the problem. The classiﬁcation is the identiﬁca-
tion of the cause. The reason for using diﬀerent nomenclatures is that those terms have received
diﬀerent names in the literature depending on the ﬁeld of application. Firstly, discretization
based only on human expertise is brieﬂy introduced. Subsequently, the basis for entropy-based
methods, which rely only on data, are revised. Afterwards, an entropy-based method that com-
bines knowledge from experts with information from training sets is proposed. The last method
presented in this section ﬁnds the maximum a posteriori cause making use of conditional beta
pdfs.
a) Experience (TEXP)
This method, which relies on knowledge only, is the most frequently used when no data is
available. Domain experts, i.e. in this case experts in troubleshooting the RAN, deﬁne the
thresholds. The main diﬃculty comes from the fact that experts are not used to deal with these
parameters and, therefore, some help is required from BN engineers. Questions such as “from
which value would you consider this symptom to be high?” may be asked to help experts to
elicit thresholds. In addition, experience has shown that thresholds are quite dependent on the
cellular network in which the diagnosis system is going to be used.
Fig.5.12 illustrates the complexity in setting thresholds. In this ﬁgure, the conditional pdfs
of the symptom “Ratio of quality samples out of band 0 in uplink path” depending on diverse
causes is shown. In the ﬁgure, the high degree of overlapping among the curves and the lack

Figure 5.12: Probability density functions of quality related symptom
of clear separation limits can be appreciated. From this observation, it can be deduced that
causes do not have the desirable property of clearly making the symptom increase when the
cause is related to that symptom, while maintaining the symptom in a low value when the cause
is not related to that symptom. For example, UL interference normally worsens the quality of
the received signal. This can be noticed in the fact that the corresponding curve in Fig.5.12
is shifted to the right in comparison to the other curves. However, even if there is a problem
of interference in the uplink, it can be observed that the probability of the symptom being low
is also noticeable. Thus, for a human expert it is not clear where to set the threshold for this
symptom.
In practice, when thresholds are elicited by experts, normally a feedback procedure of re-
ﬁnement is applied. It consists of testing the diagnosis system in a real network once initial
thresholds have been deﬁned, and ﬁne-tuning them after analysis of cases where the system was
erroneous in its diagnosis. This process is very time-consuming and it has to be repeated every
time important features or parameters of the network are changed (such as including a new type
of base station or using a new functionality).
b) Entropy Minimization Discretization (EMD)
The entropy-based method proposed in [80] will be described in this section because it is con-
sidered as state-of-the-art in discretization for classiﬁers.
For each continuous-valued attribute SC
i , the algorithm is deﬁned as follows:
1. The cases of a training set D are ﬁrst sorted by increasing value of the attribute SC
i . The
midpoint mj between the symptom values in each successive pair of cases in the sorted
sequence is considered as a potential threshold.
2. Each candidate threshold mj partitions the data set of cases D into two subsets D1 and
D2. The class entropy of the partition is evaluated as described below.

Figure 5.13: Binary class entropy
3. The best threshold ti for SC
i
is the candidate point which minimizes the class entropy of
the partition.
In [80], boundary cut points were deﬁned, which are values of mj between two cases with
diﬀerent classes in the sequence of sorted cases. It was proven that evaluating only the boundary
cut points is suﬃcient for ﬁnding the minimum class entropy, which in general highly diminishes
the number of candidates to be evaluated.
Let |R| denote the number of cases in a subset R and let |R(ci)| be used for the number of
cases in R with C = ci. The class entropy of the subset R is deﬁned as
Ent(R) = −
K
X
i=1
|R(ci)|
|R|
· log2
|R(ci)|
|R|
(5.30)
where K is the number of causes.
The utilization of the entropy can be understood from the information theory [170, 171].
For example, in the case of two classes, Fig.5.13 represents the entropy versus the probability
of one of the classes, p0 (p0 =
lim
|R|→∞
|R(ci)|
|R| ). It can be observed that the entropy is minimum
when p0 = 1 or p0 = 0, i.e. when one of the two classes is certain. On the contrary, when both
classes are equally possible, entropy is maximum.
The aim is to search for partitions where all cases in any of the subsets belong to the same
class ci, so that if an attribute value is within that interval, we can certainly assess that the
class is ci. Therefore, the goal of the heuristic should be to minimize the class entropy of each
subset.
Let mj be a boundary cut point of the set D of cases, which partitions it into the subsets
D1 and D2. The class information entropy of the partition induced by mj is the average of the

where D1 is the subset of examples in D with values of SC
i lower than mj and D2 = D\D1. Thus,
a binary discretization for D is determined by selecting the threshold ti for which Ent(D, mj, SC
i )
is minimal among all the candidate cut points mj.
In [80], the discretization is extended to multiple intervals by recursively applying the method
explained above. A minimum description length (MDL) criterion is used to decide when to stop
discretization.
c) Selective Entropy Minimization Discretization (SEMD)
A novel method, named Selective Entropy Minimization Discretization (SEMD), is proposed
hereafter.
As main contribution to the original EMD, SEMD incorporates knowledge from
domain experts about the relationships between the classes and the attributes.
As described above, the goal of EMD is to select the best threshold for a continuous symptom
SC
i so that the resulting discrete symptom Si helps to discriminate among all the classes. With
this purpose, according to (5.30), EMD calculates the class entropy of a subset adding over all
the classes. However, the symptom SC
i
is only related3 to some causes, meaning that in most
cases only some causes lead to an anomalous value of SC
i , i.e. a failure. For example, the failure
“excessive percentage of UL samples out of quality band 0” (Fig.5.12) normally only happens
when the cause is c1=“lack of coverage”, c2 =“hardware fault” or c3 =“UL interference”, but
not when the cause is any other one. Therefore, in this case, the symptom “percentage of UL
samples out of quality band 0” is related to causes c1, c2 and c3. It should be noticed that
this is just an approximation because the pdfs of the symptom given the not related causes are
diﬀerent from each other. The causes related to each symptom can be found in Table 4.11.
SEMD changes the objective of EMD from diﬀerentiating among all classes to discriminating
between two sets of classes: i) classes related to the symptom SC
i , and ii) classes not related to
the symptom SC
i . The method requires the deﬁnition of the causes related to each symptom
by the domain experts. Let Ci
r = {ci
r1, ..., ci
rRi} be the causes related to symptom SC
i , and let
Ci
n = C\Ci
r be the causes not related to symptom SC
i . The class entropy of a subset R is now
calculated as
Ent(R) = −|R(Ci
r)|
|R|
· log2
|R(Ci
r)|
|R|
−|R(Ci
n)|
|R|
· log2
|R(Ci
n)|
|R|
(5.32)
where |R(Ci
r)| denotes the number of cases in R whose class belongs to Ci
r and |R(Ci
n)| are the
number of cases in R whose class belongs to Ci
n.
3Symptom SC
i related to cause cj means that the variable SC
i is dependent on cj = yes. When the causes are
represented as the states of a single cause C, the symptom SC
i may be independent (=not related) of C only for
some values of C. This is called Asymmetric independence.
Asymmetric independence is a situation where variables may be independent of other variables for some, but
not all their values. Similarity networks [85] are one of the most important techniques to represent asymmetric
independence.

CHAPTER 5. BAYESIAN MODELLING OF FAULT DIAGNOSIS
The class entropy of the partition induced by a boundary cut point mj is calculated as (5.31).
The algorithm to calculate the best threshold for each symptom is the same one described on
page 117, substituting (5.30) by (5.32).
The complexity of SEMD is lower than that of EMD. In (5.30) there are as many additions
as number of causes, whereas in (5.32) the number of additions is two regardless of the number
of causes. Thus, the number of operations of SEMD is 2/K times the number of operations of
EMD, where K is the number of classes.
d) Beta Maximum a Posteriori (BMAP)
This novel approach, which has been named Beta Maximum a Posteriori (BMAP), follows
directly from the theory of hypothesis testing. Statistical hypothesis testing is a formal means
of distinguishing between probability distributions on the basis of random variables generated
from those distributions [164].
The application of the maximum a posteriori probability decision rule to univariate dis-
cretization consists of selecting the class that maximizes its posterior probability given a con-
tinuous attribute SC
i
max
j [P(cj|sC
i )] = max
j [fSC
i (sC
i |cj) · P(cj)]
(5.33)
where fSC
i (sC
i |cj) is the conditional pdf of symptom SC
i in sC
i given cause cj.
Instead of considering all causes separately, a distinction among the causes Ci
r related to a
given attribute SC
i and the causes Ci
n not directly related to SC
i is carried out, similarly to the
SEMD method. Thus, eq.5.33 becomes
max
n,r [P(Ci
r|sC
i ), P(Ci
n|sC
i )]
(5.34)
The threshold ti is the cross-over point of the curves deﬁned by (5.34), corresponding to
causes related and not related to SC
i , i.e. the value that accomplishes the following equation
X
cj∈Cir
fSC
i (ti|cj) · P(cj) =
X
cj∈Cin
fSC
i (ti|cj) · P(cj)
(5.35)
where it has been considered that causes are exclusive and the Bayes’ rule has been applied.
For example, Fig.5.14 shows both terms of the previous equality together with the cross-over
point ti for the symptom “Percentage of samples with Uplink signal level<-100 dBm”. The
related causes are “lack of coverage” and “hardware fault” because in the presence of any of
those causes the received signal level is normally reduced.
In eq.(5.35), the prior probabilities of causes can be easily elicited by domain experts based on
their experience. Thus, the main diﬃculty is determining the conditional pdfs of the symptoms
given the causes, which are not normally known in most application domains. Nevertheless, in
cellular networks the pdfs of symptoms conditioned to the causes can be accurately modelled
as beta pdfs, as explained in Section 5.2.3. Hence, based on the set of training cases D, the
parameters a and b can be estimated using a maximum likelihood method [164]. Alternatively, if

In summary, the BMAP discretization method is described by the following procedure:
1. Prior probabilities of causes should be determined based on data or on knowledge.
2. For each continuous symptom SC

and cause cj, calculate the parameters a and b of the
beta pdf that best ﬁt the training data. Those parameters can also be elicited by experts.
3. Find the threshold ti as the cross point between the probability of the related causes given

symptom.

Methods to estimate probabilities
The aim of this section is to present diﬀerent alternatives for deﬁning the probabilities of a
discrete BN. In particular, due to the structures of the BNs presented in Section 5.4, we are
interested in the prior probabilities of the conditions P(ok,h), the conditional probabilities of
causes given conditions P(ci|ok,h) and the conditional probabilities of the discretized symptoms
given the causes P(sj,g|ci), ∀i, j, k, h, g. In order to simplify the model, it will be assumed that
symptom Sj has been discretized into only two states sj,1 and sj,2. In the following sections
P(Sj = sj,1|ci) will be expressed as P(sj,1|ci). Furthermore, only sj,1 will be computed because
P(sj,2|ci) = 1 −P(sj,1|ci).
Firstly, probability elicitation based only on human expertise is summarized. The described
method in the following section, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), calculates the prob-
abilities of the BN based on relative frequencies of occurrence in training data. The following
algorithm, m-estimate (MEST), assumes beta prior probabilities to compute the probabilities.
Finally, last section presents a method, Beta Distribution Function (BDF), to calculate the
probabilities from beta distribution functions obtained from a training set.

a) Experience (EXP)
The ﬁrst method is based on knowledge only. Experts in diagnosis elicit the probabilities of
the BN based on their experience. Several techniques [175, 163, 188] have been proposed to
obtain those numbers from domain experts who are normally reluctance to provide numerical
probabilities.
In our experiments (see Section 5.7 for more details about knowledge acquisition), experts
were asked to choose one out of ﬁve levels for the probabilities: Almost certain, Likely, Fifty-
Fifty, Improbable, Unlikely. Those levels were mapped to the following probabilities: 0.85, 0.7,
0.5, 0.3, 0.1, respectively.
b) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
MLE is one of the most commonly used estimators in statistics. When applied to probability
estimation, it approximates the probabilities with relative frequencies
P(sj,1|ci) = |D(ci, sj,1)|
|D(ci)|
; P(ci|ok,h) = |D(ci, ok,h)|
|D(ok,h)|
; P(ok,h) = |D(ok,h)|
|D|
(5.36)
where
• |D(ok,h)| is the number of cases in D where the state ok,h of the condition Ok is observed
• |D(ci)| is the number of cases in D where the cause ci is observed
• |D(ci, ok,h)| is the number of cases in D where both the cause ci and the state ok,h of the
condition Ok is observed
• |D(ci, sj,1)| is the number of cases in D where both the cause ci and the state sj,1 for the
symptom Sj are observed.
The problems with this approach arise when |D(ok,h)|, |D(ci, ok,h)|, |D(ci, sj,1)| or |D(ci)|
are low or even zero because the estimated probabilities will be inaccurate. Unfortunately, this
is normally the situation when the number of cases is scarce.
c) M-estimate (MEST)
The MEST method overcomes the poor results obtained with MLE when some probabilities are
small and the number of training cases is scarce.
Firstly, in order to reduce the problems when either |D(ok,h)| or |D| are small, Laplace’s law
of succession [86, 114] is applied. Thus, the prior probability of a condition ok,h is estimated by
the probability of the condition happening in the next trial when there were |D(ok,h)| cases where
the condition was ok,h in the |D| previous cases. This rule assumes that the initial distribution
of conditions is uniform. Thus, the probability of the condition ok,h is estimated as
P(ok,h) = |D(ok,h)| + 1
|D| + Wk
(5.37)
MENÚ
SALIR

5.5. LEARNING OF MODEL PARAMETERS
123
where Wk is the number of states of condition Ok.
Secondly, for the estimation of conditional probabilities, beta pdfs are preferred to uniform
pdfs as the initial probability distributions. Accordingly, the conditional probability of causes
given conditions P(ci|ok,h) can be computes using the m-estimate [140, 58, 201] as
P(ci|ok,h) = |D(ci, ok,h)| + m · P(ci)
|D(ok,h)| + m
(5.38)
where P(ci) is estimated by Laplace’s law of succession as
P(ci) = |D(ci)| + 1
|D| + K
(5.39)
where K is the number of causes.
Likewise, the conditional probability of symptoms given causes P(sj,1|ci) can be calculated
as
P(sj,1|ci) = |D(ci, sj,1)| + m · P(sj,1)
|D(ci)| + m
(5.40)
where P(sj,1) is estimated by Laplace’s law of succession as
P(sj,1) = |D(sj,1)| + 1
|D| + 2
(5.41)
The parameter m is a constant related to the a and b parameters of the beta pdfs. In our
experiments, the default value m = 2 has been used because it empirically gives good results,
according to [58]. Alternatively, m could be estimated based on the parameters a and b of the
prior beta pdf estimated by experts, according to the following. Let β be a random variable
following a beta distribution with parameters a and b. The average prior probability of β can
be calculated (eq.5.9) as
Eprior(β) =
a
a + b
(5.42)
In Section 5.2.2, it was explained that if the prior probability of a random variable β was
beta with parameters a and b, the posterior probability after n successes and N −n failures were
observed in N trials was also beta with parameters a + n and b + N −n. Therefore, the average
posterior probability can be obtained as
Eposterior(β) =
a + n
a + b + N = m · Eprior(β) + n
m + N
(5.43)
where a + b has been called m. Eq.5.38 and 5.40 are particularizations of eq.5.43.
Therefore, experts in diagnosis the RAN could estimate the parameters a and b of the prior
distributions for each conditional pdf and, then, m could be calculated as a + b and Eprior could
be computed following eq.5.42. Instead of a and b, other parameters easier to estimate by expert
could be deﬁned, e.g. the mean and standard deviation. Alternatively, experts could directly
MENÚ
SALIR

124
CHAPTER 5. BAYESIAN MODELLING OF FAULT DIAGNOSIS
specify Eprior and m. In that case, m gives an idea about the standard deviation of the beta
distribution: if the experts feel conﬁdent about asserted Eprior, that means that variance is small
and m should be large; on the contrary, if the expert is not sure of Eprior, variance is large and
m should be small.
According to (5.37)-(5.41), it can be noticed that even if |D(ok,h)|, |D(ci, ok,h)|, |D(ci, sj,1)|,
|D(ci)| or |D| are zero, the estimated probabilities will be diﬀerent from zero.
d) Beta Distribution Function (BDF)
The BDF method is used to estimate the conditional probabilities for symptoms, which are the
most complex probabilities to deﬁne. In that case, the prior probabilities of conditions and the
probabilities of causes given conditions can be elicited by experts or calculated using the Laplace
or m-estimate algorithms.
The BDF method consists in calculating the conditional probability of the ﬁrst state of the
symptom as the value of the distribution function in the threshold between the two states.
Firstly, training data should be ﬁtted to beta pdfs based on expertise or using a maximum
likelihood method [164].
Once the parameters of the beta pdfs have been estimated for all
symptoms, the conditional probabilities can be calculated as the area under the beta curve in
each interval
P(sj,1|ci) = FSC
j |ci(tj)
(5.44)
where FSC
j |ci(s) is the distribution function of the symptom SC
j conditioned to cause ci. FSC
j |ci(s)
is a beta distribution function (i.e. the integral of a beta pdf) with parameters a and b calculated
based on the training data or deﬁned by experts. The threshold tj can be calculated applying
any of the methods described in Section 5.5.1.
For example, Fig.5.15 shows the conditional pdf for the symptom “Percentage of samples with
Uplink signal level<-100 dBm”, together with the threshold calculated according to BMAP. The
shadowed area (0.075) is the probability of the symptom being in the ﬁrst state (low) conditioned
to a “HW fault”. Thus, the probability of the symptom being in the second state is 0.925.

Introduction
As explained before, in cellular networks normally there are no databases of classiﬁed training
examples. Due to the diﬃculty to get training cases, very often the only option from the ones
presented in section 5.5 is to deﬁne the parameters of the model using the experience of RAN
troubleshooters.
In the discretization of continuous symptoms, the number of states should be kept as low as
possible in order to ease the knowledge acquisition process. However, if the number of states is
too low, the accuracy of the diagnosis decreases because the approximation to the real behavior
is coarse. For example, Fig.5.16 shows the posterior probability of a cause given the available

evidence vs. the value of a continuous symptom S. The dotted lines are the results obtained from
discrete BNs where the continuous variables were discretized (either into 2 or 3 states), whereas
the continuous line represents the posterior probability obtained from a Bayesian classiﬁer where
the continuous symptoms were not discretized, therefore its behavior is closer to reality. In this
example, when the symptom was discretized into two states, the threshold was set to 19%.
That means that if the symptom was lower than 19% it was considered low.
In that case,
the output of the diagnosis system for the cause DL interference was a probability of 0.1. On
the contrary, if the symptom was higher than the threshold, the probability was 0.85. These
values are obtained regardless of how close to the threshold the value of the symptom is, e.g.
values of the symptoms of 18.9% and 19.1% would lead to quite diﬀerent conclusions in the
diagnosis results. This behaviour is due to the steep shape of the posterior probability, which is
far from the real statistical behaviour and also far from the way of thinking of a human expert.
Increasing the number of states to solve the previous problem has been considered unfeasible
because even specifying thresholds and probabilities for three states per symptom was considered
too demanding by experts.
The objective of this section is to propose novel diagnosis systems which improve the di-
agnosis accuracy without increasing the complexity of knowledge acquisition [40]. The aim of
the new methods is obtaining a posterior probability of causes closer to the real behavior. The
data supplied by diagnosis experts should be the same as the ones deﬁned for discrete BNs
with 2-state symptoms. With this purpose, the ﬁrst technique, which has been called Smooth
Bayesian Networks (SBN), tries to smooth the steep shape of the posterior probability of the
causes around the threshold. In the second method, which has been named Multiple Uniform
Intervals (MUI), the BN is composed of 3-state symptoms, although the expert only have to
specify a single threshold per continuous symptom. Both techniques, SBNs and MUIs, can be
used not only onto a knowledge based BN, but also when the BN has been obtained based

on training data. Nevertheless these methods are expected to be beneﬁcial specially when the
parameters in the initial BN are inaccurate, so they are recommended to be used in combination
with knowledge-based models.
5.6.2
Smooth Bayesian Networks (SBN)
Deﬁnition of SBNs
A SBN is a discrete BN with uncertainty about the states of each variable. This is the reason why
in SBNs likelihood evidence is set for the symptoms, instead of the traditional evidence. Evidence
normally determines that a symptom is in a single established state. On the contrary, likelihood
evidence (also called virtual evidence) revises a probability distribution under uncertain evidence,
i.e.
there is no certainty about which of the mutually exclusive states is taken by a given
variable [157, 59, 187]. SBNs can also be understood as a means of equalizing the probabilities
of the states of a variable. In the limit, when there is no certainty at all about the parameters
(thresholds or probabilities), the probabilities of all states should be the same.
SBNs smooth the posterior probabilities of the causes given the values of the symptoms in
order to approximate them to the reasoning mechanisms applied by human experts. With that
purpose, SBNs estimate the conditional probabilities of the symptoms given the causes by using
simple distribution functions, as it will be explained below.
A BN equivalent to a SBN can be built as follows. Let B be a discrete BN. A continuous child,
Ri, is added to each symptom, Si, that is continuous in its origin (Fig.5.17). The continuous
symptom related to the discrete symptom Si will be represented as SC
i . The pdfs fRi|Si(Ri =
s|Si = si,j), j = 1, ..., Qi, will be called belief mapping functions, fSi
j (s), because they model
the belief in the value of SC
i
given that Si is in the state si,j. For example, let’s consider the
continuous symptom SC
i =”Percentage of handovers due to interference” and let’s assume that

Figure 5.17: Addition of a child to the discrete symptom S in order to ”smooth” the BN
the discrete symptom Si has three states: low / medium / high. If the value of SC
i is s = 20%,
fRi|Si(Ri = 20%|Si = low) represents the pdf of the continuous symptom in the value 20%,
knowing that this value is considered low by an expert. Most existing commercial tools for BNs
include functionalities to deal with virtual evidence, without the need to implicitly adding the
continuous nodes, Ri.
A SBN can be deﬁned by the original BN B, the speciﬁcation of the nodes to be smoothed,
SR = {S1, ..., SW }, and the set F = fSi
j (s), i = 1, ..., W, j = 1, ..., Qi, of belief mapping
functions. According to the laws of probability, the belief mapping functions should comply
with:
Z
SC
i
fSi
j (s) ds = 1
∀i, j
(5.45)
It can be easily demonstrated that SBNs approximate the probability of a continuous symp-
tom SC
i , given a cause Ck, as linear combinations of the belief mapping functions in s:
∧
f SC
i |Ck (s| Ck) =

j (s) =
Qi
X
j=1
ak
i,j · fSi
j (s)
(5.46)
where the ak
i,j depend on the probabilities obtained from the original discrete BN B.
A SBN equivalent to the initial discrete BN B can be built using rectangular belief mapping
functions (Fig.5.18(a)), meaning that any value between the boundaries of a given state is
equally probable. Nevertheless, a human expert’s way of reasoning is far from that behavior.
For example, knowing that a symptom is low, an expert would think that low values of SC
i are
more probable. However, this probability would not be constant for all values lower than the
threshold (like it is the case when using rectangular functions), but it would gradually decrease
when approaching the threshold.

Belief mapping functions
In the following pages some examples of belief mapping functions will be presented. In order
to make the knowledge acquisition aﬀordable for the experts only two states per symptom will
be used to discretize the continuous variables. Complex functions and more states may increase
the diagnosis accuracy, but also increase the need for detailed input from domain experts.
The transition zone of a set of belief mapping function fSi
j , j = 1, 2, is deﬁned as a range
of values centered in the threshold T = ti,1 and having a width of p (which is called degree of
smoothness). The threshold T is also the point where the belief mapping functions decay to half
of their maximum value.
There is a trade-oﬀin selecting the adequate belief mapping functions: on the one hand,
achieving high classiﬁcation accuracy, and, on the other hand, simplifying the knowledge acqui-
sition process. Firstly, the belief mapping functions should be selected so that (5.46) is as close
as possible to the actual statistical behavior of the continuous variable.
Secondly, the number of parameters for the functions should be low. It is recommended
that the parameter p of the mapping functions is set as default by the model designer and it
is not required that the diagnosis experts change it, in order not to increase the information
provided during knowledge acquisition. At the most, the expert could be asked for his/her level
of conﬁdence in the deﬁned parameters. If the expert is conﬁdent with the parameters in the
model, p should be low. Otherwise, p should be medium or large (e.g. we have empirically found
out that p = 20% is normally a good selection when parameters are not very accurate).
A third consideration is that the diagnosis should not be very sensitive to small changes in
the parameters of the mapping functions, in particular to the thresholds. For example, in the
case of traditional BNs, a small change in the deﬁnition of the thresholds may lead to diﬀerent
conclusions in the diagnosis, especially if the values of the symptoms are near the thresholds.
The sensitivity to changes in a given parameter x can be measured as
∂P (Ck| E) (x)
∂x
(5.48)
where P(Ck|E) is the posterior probability of the cause Ck given the available evidence E and
x is a parameter of a belief mapping function.
In this thesis, some simple belief mapping functions are proposed (see 5.C for the related
equations):

• Rectangular functions (rect)
The original discrete BN B is equivalent to a SBN with rectangular mapping functions.
The rectangular belief mapping functions for a continuous symptom SC
i discretized in two
states are shown in Fig.5.18(a). They are uniform pdf in the interval corresponding to a
given state.
This set of mapping functions depends on a single parameter: the threshold between the
states, T. In this case, the degree of smoothness p is always zero. The main advantage of
the rectangular functions is that the knowledge acquisition and the BN implementation
are very simple. However, the sensitivity is very high for values of the evidence around
the threshold T.
• Trapezoidal functions (trap)
The trapezoidal mapping functions for a continuous symptom SC
i
discretized into two
states are lines in the transition zone, as shown in Fig.5.18(b). These functions are aimed
to reduce the slope of the rectangular functions around the threshold.
This set of functions depends on two parameters: the threshold T and the degree of
smoothness p. The parameter p has been called degree of smoothness because it is related
to the slope of the functions. In this case, the slope is diﬀerent from zero only in the
transition zone. It should be pointed out that the functions are normalized to comply
with (5.45). Furthermore, p is limited so that the transition zone lies within the range of
the symptom.
• Rect-Gaussian functions (gaus)
These types of mapping functions (Fig. 5.18(c)) are related to Gaussian distributions.
Similarly to the trapezoidal functions, they depend on two parameters: the threshold T
and the degree of smoothness p. The function corresponding to the ﬁrst state is constant
for values below T −p/2 and a gaussian function, whose average is T −p/2, from that value
onwards. Likewise, the function corresponding to the second state is a gaussian function,
whose average is T + p/2, for values below T + p/2 and constant above that value. Thus,
the degree of smoothness p is related to the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution
according to p = 2σ
√
ln 4. Similarly to trapezoidal functions, rect-gaussian functions are
normalized and p is limited.
Related work
Several authors have tried to incorporate the continuity of human reasoning in BNs. In [152,
153, 151] two diﬀerent components in uncertainty are distinguished: uncertainty in the output
of a clearly deﬁned and randomly occurring event (described by a probability) and uncertainty
inherent in the description of the event itself (described by fuzzy logic). Thus, in those papers,
an integration of BNs and fuzzy logic [206], called Fuzzy Causal Probabilistic Networks (FCPN)
is proposed. In a FCPN there is a fuzziﬁer and a defuzziﬁer associated to each discrete variable

of a BN. A fuzziﬁer converts a continuous variable to a fuzzy variable, whereas a defuzziﬁer does
the inverse. In [151] Conditional Gaussian models are used for mapping between continuous
variables and their partner fuzzy variables. In [200] a methodology is presented to estimate the
pdf of a continuous variable from the probabilities of the discrete variables in the BN. Using
the estimated pdfs and the prior probabilities, the posterior probability of the hypothesis given
the continuous evidence can be determined. The estimated density functions depend on the
deﬁnition of the membership functions, which are characteristics of fuzzy sets. [159] uses two
approaches to diagnose print defects: BNs and fuzzy logic. The ﬁnal diagnosis is a combination
of the conclusions of the two systems. Finally, [60] uses fuzzy logical operators and possibility
vectors to design a fuzzy belief network.
Amongst previous references, the technique in [152] is the closest to the one proposed in this
thesis, SBNs. The main diﬀerences between these two are:
• Reference [152] is directly related to the theory of fuzzy logic. SBNs are only based on
probability theory.
• Reference [152] uses soft evidence, whereas SBNs apply likelihood evidence. Soft evidence
specify the probability distribution of a variable. Likelihood evidence revises a probability
distribution under uncertain evidence. More information about the diﬀerences between
soft evidence and virtual evidence can be found in [187].
• The methods presented in references [152, 151, 200] achieve the same ultimate results as
SBNs: smoothing the posterior probabilities of the hypothesis given the value of continuous
variables. However, the procedures followed to get the smoothing are diﬀerent and so it is
the actual shape of the posterior probability.
Although the problem of handling continuous variables has already been tackled in the
literature, none of the papers described above quantiﬁed the beneﬁts of using the proposed
methods instead of the traditional discrete BNs. Assessing the eﬀects of using diﬀerent functions
to approximate the continuous pdf is another aspect that has not been previously described.
5.6.3
Multiple Uniform Intervals (MUI)
A straightforward approach to improve the diagnosis performance of the diagnosis systems based
on BNs is increasing the number of intervals in which the continuous symptoms are discretized.
The drawback is that the knowledge acquisition is complicated because the number of parameters
increases signiﬁcantly. The algorithm proposed in this section, which will be called Multiple
Uniform Intervals, increases the number of intervals while the amount of information required
from experts remains the same compared to the case when only two intervals are used [40].
Let SC
i
be a continuous symptom, which has been discretized into two intervals and let Si
be the resulting discrete symptom. The parameters elicited by the experts are the probability
of the ﬁrst state given each cause Ck, pk
i,1, and the boundary between the two states, T.

(5.50)
The algorithm consists of creating a third interval centered in T, whose width p is a pa-
rameter equivalent to the degree of smoothness characteristic of SBNs.
In order to set the
probability of the new state, it is assumed that the continuous symptom given the cause follows
a uniform distribution. The uniform distribution has been chosen because it is the most ade-
quate distribution when there is no prior certainty. Thus, the probability of the second state
is:
pk∗
i,2 =
p
b −a
(5.51)
where a and b are the lower and upper limits, respectively, of the continuous symptom.
The probabilities of the other two states have to be updated to

where S2 is the set of symptoms Si whose state is the second one, Si ∈S2 ⇔Si = si,2.
It should be pointed out that the posterior probabilities of the causes obtained with eq.(5.53)
are independent on the assumptions taken for the pdf of the symptoms (i.e. uniform or any
other pdf). This is due to the fact that probabilities of the ﬁrst and last state are updated
by multiplying the initial probability by 1 −pk∗
i,2 (see eq.5.52). Consequently, the same factors
appear in the numerator and denominator of eq.(5.53).
5.7
Knowledge Acquisition
A BN consists of a qualitative and a quantitative part. The qualitative part is composed of
nodes and arcs among them, that is the variables in the model and their dependencies. The
quantitative part are the probabilities, which link the variables. Probabilistic information can
be obtained from diverse sources. The most common ones are statistical data, literature and
human experts [77].
Firstly, in many application domains, such as medical diagnosis, large
data collections are available [50] documenting previously solved problems. These data can be
used to automatically build the BN structure and to calculate the quantitative part that best
ﬁts the available information [143, 53, 64, 94]. Secondly, literature often provides probabilistic
information in some application domains.
However, this information is usually not directly
MENÚ
SALIR

5.7. KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION
133
applicable to model construction because of diverse reasons: not all probabilities are provided,
probabilities are expressed in a direction reverse to the direction required by the BN, population
from which information is derived is diﬀerent from the population for which the BN is being
developed, etc. Finally, when there are few or no reliable data available, the knowledge and
experience of experts in the domain of application is the only source of information to build the
BN.
If the diagnosis model is based on discrete BNs, quantitative information should also include
the discretization of continuous variables.
As this aspect is something external to the BN,
literature related to construction of BNs normally does not mention this important part of the
model design. Due to the fact that in mobile communications networks most symptoms are
inherently continuous, in this thesis discretization has been considered a crucial issue in the
deﬁnition of the quantitative model. Similarly to probabilities elicitation, discretization can also
be based on data, literature or expertise.
In mobile communication networks, currently there are not historical collections of diagnosed
cases. Furthermore, diagnosis of the RAN of cellular networks is not documented in existing
literature. Thus, experience of troubleshooting experts is, in most cases, the only source of
information to build a diagnosis model. Deﬁnition of the quantitative model based on statistical
data was presented in Sections 5.5.1 and 5.5.2. This section is focused on knowledge acquisition.
Knowledge acquisition (KA),i.e. building a BN from the knowledge of experts in the applica-
tion domain, involves two phases. Firstly, knowledge gathering, that is obtaining the knowledge
from experts. Secondly model construction, that is deﬁning the model based on the previously
acquired information. KA has been considered the bottleneck of BNs because the parameters
(e.g. number of probabilities) involved in a large BN is normally intractable to be speciﬁed by
human experts. Hence, KA requires a trade-oﬀbetween a large and detailed model to obtain
accurate results on the one hand, while, on the other hand, keeping the cost of construction
and maintenance and the complexity of probabilistic inference at a reasonable level. In KA,
several problems are often encountered. On the one hand, experts in the application domain
are not normally used to the terminology used in BNs. In addition, experts feel reluctance to
specify precise quantitative information. On the other hand, experts’ time is scarce, while KA
is normally a very time-consuming task. Therefore, several techniques have been proposed to
simplify knowledge acquisition [175, 188, 76].
Based on the theory presented in the following sections, a tool may be built in order to auto-
matically carry out knowledge acquisition [36, 42], which has been named Knowledge Acquisition
Tool (KAT). KAT is envisaged to guide the expert through a sequence of questions regarding
his/her way of reasoning in diagnosis. A diagnosis model is automatically constructed based on
his/her answers. The main advantage of KAT is that it is very easy to use by troubleshooting
experts as no BN knowledge is required to use the tool. As a consequence, domain experts can
transfer their expertise using a language that they understand. It should be taken into account
that model construction depends on the BN structure. Therefore, user should specify which
type of model he/she wishes to build.
In Section 5.7.1, KA is presented when the target is to build a discrete BN [42]. Likewise,

5.7.1
Bayesian Network
Knowledge gathering
Knowledge gathering is composed of the phases presented in Fig.5.19, which will be explained in
the paragraphs below. Table 5.3 summarizes the qualitative information that the expert should
provide, whereas quantitative information can be found in Table 5.4.
1. Select Fault Category. Fault categories are the diverse problems that the RAN may
suﬀer, such as “High DCR” or “Congestion”. A diﬀerent model is built for each fault
category. Although this thesis is focused on the problem “High DCR”, the proposed KA
is also valid to construct models for other fault categories.
2. Deﬁne variables. There should be a database of causes, symptoms and conditions. The
expert has the chance of either selecting a variable from the database or deﬁning a new
one, which should then be incorporated into the database. If the number of variables in
the database is large, it may be very time-consuming to read all of them in order to ﬁnd a
cause similar to the one that the expert wants to deﬁne [167]. In that case, once the user
MENÚ
SALIR

5.7. KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION
135
has described the variable, KAT should ﬁnd and present similar variables, e.g. the terms
“HW fault” and “fault in a piece of equipment” should be merged in the search.
Firstly, the expert speciﬁes the possible causes of the fault category, that is the causes of the
problem in the network for which the diagnosis model is being built (e.g. “High DCR”),
{C1, ..., CK}. It is recommended to include a cause called “Other causes”, in order to
cover any other possible cause of the problem not explicitly included in the deﬁned causes.
Secondly, the expert is demanded to enumerate the symptoms that may help to identify
the previously deﬁned causes, {S1, ..., SM}. The states, si,j, of each symptom, Si, should
also be speciﬁed. Lastly, the user is requested about conditions, {O1, ..., OL}, and their
states, oi,j, which may also help to identify the cause.
3. Deﬁne relations.
In this phase, the user should deﬁne which are the causes, Ci
r =
{Ci
r1, ..., Ci
rRi}, related to each symptom Si. The term “related” is used to qualify those
variables which have a strong direct inter-dependency (see page 119). For example, the
cause “Lack of coverage” is related to the symptom “Percentage of UL samples with level
< −100 dBm”, whereas the cause “UL interference” is not related to that symptom. The
explanation is that a lack of coverage reduces the received signal level in comparison to
the average received signal level in a network without problems, whereas when the cause
is interference, the received signal level is not signiﬁcantly decreased in comparison to the
level in a cell without problems. The causes not related to symptom Si will be denoted
Ci
n = C\Ci
r.
The expert should also specify which are the conditions, Oi
r = {Oi
r1, ..., Oi
rUi}, associated
to each cause Ci, that is conditions whose value can modify his/her belief in the probability
of the cause being the one causing the problem.
4. Specify thresholds. For each continuous symptom, Si, interval limits (i.e. thresholds),
ti,j, between each deﬁned interval should be requested from the user.
5. Specify probabilities. Verbal probability expressions are often suggested as a method
of eliciting probabilistic information [163]. The number of verbal expressions should be
reduced in order to avoid misinterpretations. In addition, it is advisable to use a graphical
scale with numbers on the one side and words on the other. In our experiments with cellular
network operators, experts were asked to choose one out of ﬁve levels of probabilities:
“Almost certain”, “Likely”, “Fifty-ﬁfty”, “Improbable” and “Unlikely”. Those levels are
mapped to the probabilities 0.85, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3 and 0.1, respectively.
The procedure to deﬁne the probabilities is as follows. Firstly, the expert is requested
about the prior probabilities of each of the possible causes of the problem, PCi. As causes
have only two states (no/yes), only the probability of the cause being present is demanded.
In the case of a cause Ci related to a condition Oj, probability of Ci should be deﬁned
for each state of Oj. If more than a condition is related to Ci, probability of Ci should
be deﬁned for each combination of states of the associated conditions, PCi|Or
i . Very often,

only some combinations of states are implemented in the network, thus the expert should
have the option of deﬁning only those combinations that make sense. The probabilities for
impossible combinations of conditions should be set to zero. If the number of conditions
is large, the number of probabilities to be deﬁned may become intractable.
However,
experience with cellular network operators has shown that the number of deﬁned conditions
is normally kept low, and so is the number of demanded probabilities.
The second step is deﬁning prior probabilities of conditions, POi,j. The number of proba-
bilities to be speciﬁed for each condition depends on its number of states, Wi.
Lastly, probabilities for symptoms are requested. For a symptom Si, KAT should ask the
probability of each state of the symptom given that each of the related causes, Ck ∈Ci
r,
is present and the other causes are absent, PSi,j|Ck. In addition, the probability of each
state of the symptom given that none of the related causes are present should be deﬁned,
PSi,j|C0.
In all cases, the expert should take into account that the sum of the probabilities over all
the states of a given symptom or condition should sum up 1. KAT should warn the expert
if this is not the case.
6. Link symptoms and conditions to database. The last step is linking the variables in
the model to the data in the NMS. Thus, symptoms and conditions should be related to a
parameter (performance indicator, counter, etc.) available in the NMS or a combination
of parameters. For this last option, KAT should ease the construction of equations.

Model construction for SBM
SBM was depicted in Fig.5.7. In this BN the required probabilities are the prior probabilities
of causes, P(C), and the probabilities of symptoms and conditions given causes, P(Si|C) and
P(Oi|C).
The data provided by experts are those in Tables 5.3 and 5.4, which should be
converted into the required probabilities in the SBM.
Causes are the mutually exclusive states, c1, ..., cK, of variable C.
For a cause without
parent conditions the probability elicited by experts, PCi, is the probability of the cause, P(C =
ci).
However, when the cause depends on some conditions, experts provide the conditional
probability of the cause given the related conditions. In order to deﬁne the probability table
for the C node, ﬁrstly an auxiliary probability table of the cause given the conditions should be
built, taken into account that P(Ci|Oi
r, Oi
n) = P(Ci|Oi
r). For example, let’s consider two causes
C1 and C2, and a condition O1, which is related to C1. The probabilities elicited by experts are
PC1|O1=off = 0.2, PC1|O1=on = 0.6, PC2 = 0.7, P(O1 = off) = 0.3. Then, the probability table
P(C|O1) would be that shown in Table.5.5.
Taking into account that in the SBM the causes are the exclusive states of a single node,
the probabilities of the causes should sum up 1. That means that the sum of probabilities of
the states of the C node should be 1 for any column of the conditional probability table (any
combination of states of the conditions). There are two ways of dealing with that constraint:
either the expert is responsible of checking that he gave the right probabilities or it is allowed
that the elicited probabilities do not comply with that constraint, and then they are modiﬁed

by KAT. The latter will be done according to the following procedure:
• If the sum of any column is higher than 1, the followed criterion has been to maintain the
ratio amongst the probabilities of the same cause given diﬀerent states of the conditions.
Hence, a normalization constant B is deﬁned as the highest of the sum of the columns. In
the example in Fig.5.5, B would 1.3. Then, all entries in the probability table should be
normalized by dividing them by B.
• If the sum of probabilities of any column is less than 1, a cause cK+1, named “Others”, is
added to the table. That cause stands for any other cause of the problem not considered
by the expert. The probability of that cause is 1 minus the sum of all probabilities in the
same column. Fig.5.6 shows how the table 5.5 would be modiﬁed.
• The probability of each cause, P(C = ci), should be calculated according to the following
equations:

According to the previous procedure, for the example in Table 5.5, the probabilities for the
C node would be P(C = c1) = 0.37, P(C = c2) = 0.54 and P(C = c3) = 0.09.
Probability table for symptom Si is presented in Table 5.7. On the one hand, the probabilities
of Si conditioned to related causes have been explicitly elicited by the expert. On the other hand,
the expert has also deﬁned the probability of the symptom conditioned to non-related causes,
which is the same for all non-related causes.
In the SBM, conditions are represented as children of the parent node.
Therefore, the
probabilities of conditions given causes are required, whereas the available probabilities are

Model construction for CBM
The diﬀerence between the SBM and the CBM is how conditions are modelled. In the CBM
conditions are parent of the cause node (Fig.5.8). Thus, probability tables for condition nodes
are directly built with the prior probabilities of conditions elicited by experts (Table 5.8).
The probability table for the C node is deﬁned as the auxiliary conditional probability table
of the SBM (see page 137). Finally, the probability tables for the symptoms coincide with the
tables in the SBM (Table 5.7).
Model construction for ICI
In models designed following the ICI assumptions, causes are modelled as diﬀerent nodes
(Fig.5.11). Each cause node has two states (false/true). Probability tables for condition vari-
ables are those shown in Table 5.8 for the CBM. Probability tables for the cause nodes are

directly built based on the information elicited by expert (Table 5.9). Finally, probability tables
for the symptom variables are deﬁned according to eq.(5.21), as shown in Table 5.10.
If a leak cause is included in the model, the expert normally deﬁnes the probability of each
related cause given that none of the other related causes are present and the leak cause is present,
PSi,j|Ck. That probability can be expressed depending on the probability of the leak cause and
the probabilities in eq.(5.21) as
PSi,j|Ck =
X
{A0,Ak|g(A0,Ak,Ah|∀h̸=k Ah=sh,1)=si,j}
PA0|C0 · PAk|Ck
(5.58)
From this equation, the values of PAk,j|Ck can be obtained depending on PSi,j|Ck and PSi,j|C0 =
(PAk,j|C0). For example, eq.(5.25) codes the relations among the previous probabilities for the
Noisy-OR model.
5.7.2
Bayesian Classiﬁer
Knowledge gathering
KA for the BC is composed of the phases presented in Fig.5.20. All phases but 4 and 5 are
identical to the ones explained for the construction of BNs. Step 4 is also equal to the speciﬁ-
cation of probabilities for causes and conditions for BNs. However, while in BNs probabilities
for symptoms had to be deﬁned, in BCs symptoms are assumed to be continuous and the in-
formation to be provided by experts are the parameters of the pfds. As explained in 5.2.3,
the conditional probabilities of the symptoms given the causes can be modelled as beta pdfs or
combinations of beta pdfs. Therefore, the required data are the a and b parameters of these beta
pdfs. Nevertheless, normally the experts are not familiar with the meaning of those parameters.
Hence, the aim should be to identify two parameters which are easy to deﬁne by experts and
could be converted into the a and b parameters.

CHAPTER 5. BAYESIAN MODELLING OF FAULT DIAGNOSIS
The ﬁrst parameter could be the expected value or the mode. In some tests with experts it
has been observed that for symptoms it is more intuitive to specify the mode ν, i.e. the most
probable value, than the expected value.
The second parameter should give an idea of the variance of the distribution. It is proposed
to request the symptom value, y, above the mode whose probability is much lower than that of
the mode. For example, the question to be asked could be “what is the value of the symptom
whose probability is 100 times lower than the probability of the mode?”.
These two parameters should be deﬁned for the conditional pdf of each symptom given each
related cause. In addition, the parameters for the beta pdf for each symptom given that none
of the related causes is present should also be speciﬁed. KAT should depict the beta pdf based
on the parameters elicited by the expert, so that he/she could check whether the pdf ﬁts with
his/her knowledge.
Model construction
Probability tables for conditions and causes are built as those of the CBM. Deﬁning pdfs for
symptoms means determining the values of a and b of their corresponding beta pdfs. Diﬀerent
methods have been proposed for the elicitation of those two parameters by experts [198, 148].
The Equivalent Prior Sample (EPS) method asks the experts to give an estimate of the mean
of the distribution, ρ, and of the sample size, n, that he is basing his assessment upon. The
larger the sample size, the more information the expert believes he has. Based on his answers,
the parameters of the beta distribution can be calculated as a = nρ and b = n(1 −ρ). In the
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) method, the expert is asked to give his estimate of
the median of the distribution and to give another quantile. The beta distribution can then be
ﬁtted to the quantiles. In the Probability Density Function (PDF) method, experts elicit the
mode, ν, and a value of the symptom that is half as likely as the modal value.
The method proposed in this thesis is a generalization of the PDF method. The two param-
eters deﬁned by experts are the mode, ν, and a η parameter, which is a symptom value whose
probability is k times (k < 1) the probability of the mode4.
The mode of the beta pdf is:
ν =
a −1
a + b −2
(5.59)
Then, the a and b parameters of the beta pdfs can be obtained from ν, k and η as follows:
a =

Appendix: Example of model under ICI assumptions
A symptom S=“percentage of UL quality HOs (Qua HO UL)” may have three possible causes:
“UL interference (I)”, “Lack of coverage (C)” or “Hardware fault (H)”. S has been discretized
in three intervals: low/medium/high. Thus, its corresponding random variable has three states:
0, 1, 2. Probabilities elicited by experts are shown in Table 5.11. First probability in the second
column of the table corresponds to the distinguished state. The purpose of this example is to
compare the probability table of symptom S when ICI models with diﬀerent g functions are
applied. The leak cause has not been included, i.e. when all causes are absent the symptom is
at its distinguished state.
Fig.5.22 shows the BN structure adopted to model this example.
Probability table for
symptom S applying diﬀerent g functions are shown in Table 5.12 (Noisy-Max), Table 5.13
(Noisy-Add), Table 5.14 (Noisy-Addlim) and Table 5.15 (Noisy-Addceil). Table 5.16 presents the
probability of each cause depending on the state taken by the symptom S for all the structures.

Let S1, . . . , SM be the discrete symptoms of a SBN. Let add M continuous children, R1, . . . , RM,
one for each discrete symptom. Then, the probability of a cause C can be calculated as:
P (C| R1, R2 . . . RM) = P(C, R1, . . . , RM)
P(R1, . . . , RM)
=

eq.(5.62) becomes

Appendix: Example of KA
An expert in troubleshooting of GERAN has speciﬁed the qualitative model (Table 5.17) and
the quantitative model (Table 5.18). From this information, a diagnosis model is built. Fig.5.23
shows a BN following the SBM structure. Probability tables are shown in Tables 5.19, 5.20 and
5.21. Cause C = c4 represents any other cause of the problem not explicitly deﬁned by the
expert.
Fig.5.24 shows an alternative model, which follows the CBM structure. Probability tables
for symptom nodes are the same ones as for the SBM (Table 5.20). Tables 5.22 and 5.23 show
the probability table for the cause node and the condition nodes, respectively.
Fig.5.25 depicts a Noisy-OR model. Probability tables for condition nodes are those in Table
5.23. Probability tables for the cause and the symptom nodes are presented in Tables 5.24 and
5.25, respectively.
The results provided by these three models were compared. Table 5.26 presents the prob-
abilities of the causes obtained with each model under diﬀerent evidence. The cause with the
highest probability (in bold in the table) was selected as the diagnosed cause. It can be observed
that when the cause is clear, probabilities are similar for all BNs (ﬁrst example on the table).
However, when it is not clear that only a cause is present (second example on the table), results
are diﬀerent for models under ICI assumptions. This is due to the fact that both the SBM and
the CBM assumes that only a cause is present at a time, whereas more than a cause may be
present when using the Noisy-OR model.

Results
This chapter presents the evaluation of the methods and models proposed in this thesis. In the
ﬁrst part of the chapter, Section 6.1, the experimental design is described. In Section 6.1.1, it is
explained how cases used to test and train the diﬀerent models have been obtained. Two types
of data have been used: cases from a live GERAN network and simulated cases. The ﬁgures
of merits deﬁned to evaluate and compare the diverse systems are presented in Section 6.1.2.
In addition, the sensitivity to imprecision in thresholds and probabilities was analyzed for each
model. Section 6.1.3 explains how sensitivity analysis was performed. Section 6.1.4 describes
the methodology adopted for the evaluation of the diﬀerent systems.
The second part of the chapter summarizes the main achieved results. In Section 6.2, it
is described how the parameters for a model from which simulated cases could be generated
were obtained. In Section 6.3, the experience with mobile network operators and manufacturers
in knowledge acquisition and in testing of a troubleshooting prototype is brieﬂy presented. In
Section 6.4, diverse diagnosis models were evaluated: Bayesian Classiﬁer, BNs with diﬀerent
structures, SBNs and MUI. In addition, the methods proposed in Chapter 5 to learn the param-
eters of the model (thresholds and probabilities) were compared. Finally, the drawbacks and
beneﬁts of all models are discussed in Section 6.5.
6.1
Experimental design
6.1.1
Network and simulated cases
One commonly accepted criterion for testing new classiﬁers is the use of real data from the
application domain to validate the systems. With this purpose, some repositories of machine
learning databases have been created and maintained [50]. Unfortunately, there are no such
databases of classiﬁed cases for fault diagnosis in cellular systems. In a cellular network, the
NMS keeps historical records of the value of performance indicators and conﬁguration parameters
for all cells under its supervision. However, in case there is a problem in a cell, the diagnosed
cause is not saved in the NMS once the fault is solved. Although most operators keep track of
the faults by means of a trouble ticket system (see Chapter 2), this feature is not integrated in

Therefore, one of the main diﬃculties in this thesis, as well as in the creation of an application
to be used by operators, has been to evaluate the diagnosis systems. Ideally, the systems should
be tested in a live network. This implies that a network operator should grant access to the NMSs
and/or other databases of performance indicators and conﬁguration parameters. In addition,
everyday troubleshooting experts should assert which are the cells with problems and, once
the fault is solved, they should save the cause together with its symptoms and conditions. On
the one hand, comparison with the cause diagnosed by the automatic system would allow to
measure the performance of the system under test and to ﬁne-tune the parameters in the model.
Furthermore, a database of diagnosed cases would be built, composed of cases with the cause,
conditions and symptoms for each problematic cell. This database could be used to evaluate
new classiﬁers. On the other hand, learning of model parameters (thresholds and probabilities)
requires large sets of classiﬁed cases, which should be also obtained from a live network. In spite
of these beneﬁts, operators are reluctant to give access to their databases because they do not
want information about network performance to be leaked out. On the one hand, without inputs
from the operator the troubleshooting tool will not work well. On the other hand, operators do
not want to invest any time as the tool is not working well.
Due to the fact that real cases are essential for design and evaluation of diagnosis systems,
a three month trial was carried out in a live GSM/GPRS network. The network was composed
of about 25000 cells and 10 NMSs. Everyday some problematic cells were identiﬁed and their
faults were manually diagnosed by experts in troubleshooting. The average values of the main
performance indicators on the day the fault occurred, together with the diagnosed cause, were
saved in a database of classiﬁed cases. In this way, more than 600 labelled cases were obtained.
The number of cases per fault cause is presented in Table 6.1.
These cases suﬀer from some limitations. Firstly, there is a lack of information: neither
alarms nor conﬁguration parameters were saved, not all symptoms in the model in Chapter 4
were considered, cases were classiﬁed into only a few causes, e.g. the diﬀerent HW faults were
not distinguished. Secondly, the cause diagnosed by the experts was not validated, therefore
some cases might be erroneously diagnosed. Finally, cells were not randomly selected, therefore
the percentage of cases per cause does not necessary correspond to the prior probabilities of the
causes.

Due to these constraints, a simpliﬁed diagnosis model has been designed. Alarms and condi-
tions were not included in the model. In addition to causes presented in Table 6.1 another cause
named “Others” has been included. Symptoms are shown in Table 6.2. The labels (number and
code) of the symptoms in Table 4.10 have been maintained.
In addition, in order to palliate the limitations listed above, the following assumptions were
considered:
• The spatial and temporal statistical characterization of the network is the same. In other
words, the cases can be obtained not only from a given cell along diﬀerent days, but also
from diﬀerent cells in the network. The reason for that supposition was the need to get as
many cases as possible in a short time.
• It was supposed that the diagnosis asserted by troubleshooting experts was correct, al-
though it was not checked.
The number of cases was still considered scarce compared to other domains in which BN have
been used. Thus, an algorithm to simulate as many cases as required was believed to be essential.
Taking into account the previous two assumptions, the procedure to generate simulated cases
was as follows:
1. Statistical estimation:
MENÚ

CHAPTER 6. RESULTS
• According to 5.2.3, the conditional pdfs of continuous symptoms given the causes
may be accurately approximated by beta pdfs. The parameters of the beta pdfs were
obtained using a maximum likelihood estimate of the classiﬁed cases from the real
GSM network.
• Prior probabilities of causes were elicited by diagnosis experts.
2. Case generator:
• For each case, the cause was generated according to the prior probabilities of causes.
• Once the cause was set, the value of each symptom was obtained from the previous
deﬁned conditional pdfs by using rejection or inversion methods [112].
In this algorithm, two assumptions are implicit: i) only one cause is present at a time; ii)
symptoms are independent given the cause. The ﬁrst assumption is usually true in the domain
under study, whereas the last one is not valid for most symptoms and causes. Nevertheless,
numerous studies have proven that even if strong attribute dependencies exist, models which
follow those assumptions perform very well [74, 165, 82]. Thus, the impact of ii) is expected to
be insigniﬁcant.
Following this method, two types of sets were generated: training sets, which were used by
the diﬀerent learning algorithms to estimate the parameters in the models; and test sets, which
were used to measure the performance of the diagnosis systems.
6.1.2
Performance measures
The probabilistic diagnosis systems presented in this thesis provide a probability distribution
over the set of possible causes, conditioned to a set of conditions and symptoms. The classi-
ﬁcation decision is based on this probability distribution. For example, the decision could be
selecting the cause with the highest probability. Another criterion could be specifying a thresh-
old and decide that the cause is present if its probability is higher than the threshold. The
former has been the decision criterion taken in the evaluation of diagnosis systems in this thesis.
Let D be a test set of N cases. In machine learning literature, the problem of assessing
the performance of a classiﬁer is based on a validation process in which the classiﬁer is applied
to the test set D and the output provided by the classiﬁer for each of the cases in the test is
compared with the actual class. Based on that comparison, the following ﬁgures of merit can
be deﬁned:
• The diagnosis error is the percentage of cases in D which are incorrectly diagnosed.
Complementarily, the diagnosis accuracy is the percentage of cases correctly classiﬁed.
• For each case, the correct cause probability is the probability provided by the diagnosis
system for the real cause. The average and standard deviation of this parameter over the
N cases is calculated. This measure is very important because it may indicate the level
of conﬁdence in the diagnosis. For example, if the probability of the most probable cause
MENÚ
SALIR

6.1. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
161
was 0.3, the diagnosis would be insecure. In addition, if the decision criterion is based
on a probability threshold, the classiﬁer would be better if the correct cause probability
was high. Furthermore, most algorithms for decision-theoretic troubleshooting require the
calculus of the probabilities of the causes [96, 174].
• For each case, the correct diagnosis probability is the average of the probability as-
serted by the diagnosis system for the true cause and one minus the probability provided
for each of the other causes. The average and standard deviation of this parameter over the
N cases is calculated. This ﬁgure takes into account that, ideally, not only the probability
of the correct cause should be high, but also the probabilities asserted for the other causes
should be low.
• For each case, the rank order is the order number of the real cause in the list of causes
sorted according to their probabilities. The average and standard deviation of this param-
eter over the N cases is calculated. The rank ﬁgure provides an indication of the rank
order as a percentage of the ﬁrst element in the ordered list of probabilities. That is, the
rank ﬁgure is 100 when the diagnosed cause coincides with the real cause and it is zero
when the probability of the diagnosed cause is the lowest in the list. The rank ﬁgure can
be calculated as:
F = 100 · K −r
K −1
(6.1)
where K is the number of causes and r is the rank order.
Furthermore, other ﬁgures were deﬁned in order to evaluate the accuracy separately for the
diverse causes. Let Dr
k be a subset of D composed of the cases whose real cause is Ck and let
Dn
k be a subset of D composed of the cases whose real cause is not Ck, Dn
k = D\Dr
k. Then, the
following ﬁgures have been measured:
• The type I error is the percentage of false negatives, that is the percentage of cases in
Dr
k incorrectly classiﬁed.
• The type II error is the percentage of false positives, that is the percentage of cases in
Dn
k whose diagnosed cause is Ck.
• When the decision criterion is to assert that a cause is present when its probability is
over a given threshold P, all previous ﬁgures of merits can still be used. Furthermore, a
measure sometimes found in literature is the area under the ROC1 curve [178, 91].
The ROC curve plots the percentage of true positives (=1-type I error) as a function of the
percentage of false positives (=type II error) as the threshold P is varied from 1 to 0. Each
point of the curve characterizes the performance of the classiﬁer for a given threshold. The
area under the ROC curve can be used as a measure of classiﬁcation performance. An area

6.1.3
Sensitivity Analysis
The ﬁgures of merit in Section 6.1.2 were used to evaluate the performance of the diagnosis
systems proposed in this thesis. In addition, an important aspect to consider is the sensitivity of
the results to changes in the parameters (probabilities and thresholds) of the models. It is com-
mon that the parameters in the model are not those which would achieve the best classiﬁcation
accuracy, either because of the availability of a scarce number of training cases in data-based
models or because of imprecision in the elicited parameters in knowledge-based systems. This
is the reason why it is so important to analyze how changes in the speciﬁed parameters would
impact the diagnosis results.
Basically, there are two approaches to sensitivity analysis: theoretical and empirical. The
theoretical approach expresses the posterior probability of interest in terms of the parameters
under study. The empirical methods examine the eﬀects of varying the parameters of the network
on the diagnosis. In the latter case, the most frequent approach consists of adding random noise
to the probabilities and examining the eﬀects on the diagnostic performance [103, 118, 158].
The sensitivity of BNs to imprecise probabilities have been extensively analyzed in the lit-
erature [55, 126, 158], however no references can be found about the sensitivity of the results
of BNs when the discretization uses inaccurate thresholds. The sensitivity analysis to imprecise
thresholds presented in this thesis is based on previous empirical methods for the sensitivity
analysis of BNs to probabilities.
That is, random noise at increasing levels is added to the
parameters and the eﬀects on the performance is evaluated. In the diagnosis model for cellular
networks, most symptoms are measured as the percentage of samples complying with a certain
condition (see 5.2.3). Therefore, the thresholds, like the probabilities, are in the [0,100] range.
In other case, the threshold could be scaled to be in the [0,100] range, the noise would then be

added and the threshold would be re-scaled to its original range.
Adding random noise directly to the parameters has two problems. Firstly, a large additive
error may produce a parameter greater than 100 or lower than 0. Secondly, the same error value
seems more serious in parameters near 0 or 100 than in those in the middle range, because the
resulting parameter could be very close to one of the limits (leading to a probability equal to
zero or one in the case of probabilities and to a single state of the discretized symptom in the
case of thresholds). In order to overcome those problems, it has been proposed to add noise
to the log-odd rather than directly to the probabilities [158] or thresholds. The new parameter
with added noise, T, in terms of the nominal parameter t and noise ε is

where parameters are expressed in % and ε follows a normal distribution.
Figure 6.2 shows the log-odd normal distribution centered around the nominal parameter
of 20% and 50% for various values of the standard deviation σ of the noise. [118] argues that
this distribution is only adequate for standard deviations lower than one. Eﬀectively, it can
be observed that for values of σ > 1 the distribution becomes bimodal, which is equivalent to
consider an expert who assesses a threshold or probability near 0 and erring in judgment by
such margin that the best parameter may be close to 100.
6.1.4
Methodology
This section explains the methodology followed in the evaluation of the methods presented in
Chapters 4 and 5.
Firstly, a diagnosis model based on the knowledge of GSM troubleshooting experts was built
MENÚ
SALIR

164
CHAPTER 6. RESULTS
with the help of an automatic knowledge acquisition tool. Tables A.1-A.3 in Appendix A present
the parameters of the knowledge-based model built in this thesis. The values in the tables will
be those referred as “experts” in the following sections. Table A.1 shows the prior probabilities
of causes. Table A.2 shows the conditional probabilities of symptoms (which were modelled
as 2-state variables) given causes. The probabilities in the table are the probabilities of the
symptoms being in the state si,2 given that the corresponding cause, Ci, is present and all other
related causes are absent. The thresholds for the symptoms are presented in Table A.3.
In order to evaluate the diﬀerent diagnosis systems, it was required either to have a live
network and operators available every time new systems had to be tested or to have a large
database of classiﬁed cases. The former was not possible, therefore the procedure explained
on page 159 was followed to obtain as many simulated cases as necessary. The 643 cases from
the live GSM/GPRS network (Table 6.1) were the basis used by the algorithm. Section 6.2
presents the estimated pdfs which were used to generate the simulated cases and it evaluates
the reasonability of those pdfs.
For the evaluation of the diagnosis systems, two types of test sets were deﬁned: network
cases and simulated cases. Let’s denote network cases (net) to the 643 diagnosed cases from the
live GSM/GPRS network (Table 6.1). Let’s denote simulated cases (sim) to the cases generated
following the algorithm explained on page 159.
Regarding the parameters of the models, two types of parameters were used: reference
parameters and learnt parameters. For systems based on BNs, let’s name reference parameters
(ref) to the probabilities and thresholds learnt from a single training set of 5000 cases using
the m-estimate and the SEMD methods, to calculate probabilities and thresholds, respectively.
This size, 5000, was chosen because it is large enough so that the diagnosis error was not due
to the size of the training set. For systems based on the BC, the reference pdf are the beta pdf
obtained using a maximum likelihood estimate of the network cases. The a and b parameters
of those beta pdfs (Tables A.4 and A.5) are named reference parameters (ref) of the BC. Let’s
denote learnt parameters (lrn) to the parameters learnt from a training set following any of the
algorithms proposed in Chapter 5.
The methodology was the following (Fig.6.3):
• Selection of the type of model parameters, either reference parameters or learnt parameters.
In the latter case, n training sets of size Ntrain are independently generated following the
algorithm on page 159. Subsequently, n sets of model parameters are calculated based on
each of the n training sets. The learning algorithm may be any of the ones proposed in
this thesis.
• Selection of the type of test set, either network cases or simulated cases. In the latter case,
n test sets of size Ntest cases are independently generated following algorithm on page
159.
• Each of the n test sets2 is used together with one of the n sets of parameters, in order to

obtain a set of n diagnosis. Then, the ﬁgures of merit (average and standard deviation)
are calculated for each of the n results.
Some of the evaluated aspects of the diagnosis systems proposed in this thesis have been:
1. Figures of Merit:
• Figures of merits were obtained when using the system to diagnose the network cases.
The parameters for the model were the reference parameters.
• Figures of merits were obtained when using the system to diagnose simulated cases.
The size of the test set was Ntest = 1000 cases. The parameters of the model were
calculated based on a training set of Ntrain cases (Ntrain = 50 or 5000). These
experiments were repeated n times with diﬀerent training sets and test sets and the
average ﬁgures of merit and standard deviations over the n results were computed.
2. Sensitivity Analysis:
• The sensitivity of the results to imprecise probabilities/thresholds was studied. The
parameters of the model were the reference parameters. A simulated test set (i.e.
n = 1) of size Ntest = 1000 cases was used. Independent log-odd random noise at
increasing level was added to the probabilities/thresholds. For each level of noise,
the experiment was repeated Ntimes times with independently generated noise. The
MENÚ
SALIR

166

average ﬁgures of merit and standard deviations over the Ntimes experiments were
calculated for each level of noise. The study was carried out separately for the prior
probabilities of causes, the conditional probabilities of symptoms given causes, the
thresholds and all probabilities and thresholds at the same time.
3. Training set size:
• The inﬂuence of the size of the training set on the performance was analyzed. The
parameters of the model were calculated based on training sets of increasing number
of cases, from Ntrain = 100 to 5000. The ﬁgures of merits were obtained when using
the system to diagnose a simulated test set of size 1000 cases. For each size of the
training set, the experiments were repeated n = 10 times with diﬀerent test sets and
training sets. The average ﬁgures of merit and standard deviations were calculated
over the 10 experiments.
4. Parameter learning:
• Discretization methods were compared using training sets of size Ntrain = 50 or
5000 cases. Tests were carried out over network cases and simulated cases (of size
Ntest = 1000 cases). These experiments were repeated n times with diﬀerent training
sets and test sets (for net cases, the test set was always the same one) and the average
ﬁgures of merit and standard deviations over the n results were computed.
• Methods to calculate the probabilities in BNs were compared using training sets of
size Ntrain = 50 or 5000 cases.
Tests were carried out over network cases and
simulated cases (of size Ntest = 1000 cases). These experiments were repeated n
times with diﬀerent training sets and test sets (for net cases, the test set was always
the same one) and the average ﬁgures of merit and standard deviations over the n
results were computed.
Furthermore, particular aspects of each diagnosis system were measured. Table 6.3 summa-
rizes the designed diagnosis systems and the types of evaluation tests carried out for each of
them. The diagnosis system under test is written on the ﬁrst column. The ﬁrst line of each entry
in the table is the type of test set, Cases: either from the live network (net) or simulated cases
(sim). Param refers to how the model parameters were obtained: either reference parameters
(ref) or learnt parameters (lrn). The learning algorithm, when applicable, is denoted as Alg.
When all methods for learning of probability and threshold were evaluated, it is denoted as all.
The number of cases in the training set, Ntrain, and in the test set, Ntest, are other data in
the table. The number of times the experiments were repeated is denoted as n. In addition,
in the column “Sensitivity Analysis”, it is also speciﬁed how many times the experiments were
repeated for each level of noise (Ntimes) and the type of analysis carried out.

6.2
Estimation of probability functions
In order to obtain as many cases as necessary, the procedure explained on page 159 was followed.
The ﬁrst step approximated the conditional pdfs of symptoms given causes by beta pdfs. With
that purpose, the cases from the trial in a live GSM/GPRS network (Table 6.1) were classiﬁed
depending on their causes, Ck, in subsets Dk. The procedure to calculate the parameters a and
b of the beta pdfs was as follows:
• For each subset Dk, repeat:
– For each symptom Si, calculate a(i, k) and b(i, k) of the beta pdf by using a maximum
likelihood estimate [164] of the values of the symptom, {s(1)
i , ..., s(Mk)
i
}, where Mk is
the number of cases in subset Dk.
For a given cause Ck and a symptom Si not related to Ck, the percentage of cases where the
symptom value is equal to zero is normally high. This is the reason why, instead of using just a
beta pdf, the pdf of the symptom was approximated by a sum of a delta at zero and a beta pdf.
If the value of the delta is close to one, the remaining number of cases (i.e. those cases where
the symptom is diﬀerent to zero) will be small and, in many cases, they will not be enough to
approximate the pdf by a beta pdf. The estimated parameters, which are denoted as reference
parameters, are shown in Tables A.4 and A.5. These values were used to build the reference
pdfs, which were taken as the gold standard to generate the simulated cases. The parameters
in the table are (a,b,d), where the pdf is deﬁned as
fSi|Ck(x) = d · δ(x) + (1 −d) · fβ(x, a, b)
(6.3)
where fβ(x, a, b) is a beta pdf, with parameters a and b, in x.
Probability plots (P-P plots) were used in order to assess whether the estimated beta pdfs
were reasonable models for the data. Probability plotting is a graphical method for determin-
ing whether sample data conform to a hypothesized distribution based on a subjective visual
examination of the data [141, 130]. To construct a P-P plot, the observations in the sample
are ﬁrst ranked from smallest to largest, x(1), x(2), ..., x(N). The hypothesized cumulative distri-
bution function (cdf) at each point is then plotted against their observed cdf i/N, i = 1, ..., N.
If the hypothesized distribution adequately describes the data, then the plotted points will fall
approximately along a straight line; if the plotted points deviate signiﬁcantly from a straight
line, then the hypothesized model is not appropriate.
In addition, chi-square tests [141, 130] were applied to evaluate the goodness of ﬁt3. The k
intervals for the chi-square tests were chosen so that the number of points in each bin was higher
3Chi-square tests: For each estimated pdf, the N samples were arranged in a histogram of k bins. Let Oi
be the observed frequency in the ith interval. From the hypothesized probability distribution, e.g. the beta pdf,
the expected frequency in the ith bin, denoted Ei, is computed. Ei can be calculated from the probabilities of
each interval given by the hypothesized pdf, pi, as Npi. The test statistic is:

or equal to 5. In addition, the maximum number of intervals was set to 50. The signiﬁcance
level was set to 1%. The results of the chi-square tests were positive for most cause / symptom
pairs, although there were some exceptions.
The estimated beta pdf for the symptom 16,
“RXLEV DL”, given cause “Lack of coverage” did not pass the chi-square test. This is due
to the fact that there were four samples (2.1% of the samples) with too low value, as can be
appreciated in Fig.6.4(a). In the ﬁgure, the normalized histogram for the data from the cellular
network is depicted in blue and the estimated pdf is drawn in red. There might be several reasons
for those low samples: the total number of samples was very low, diﬀerent types of cells were not
distinguished, etc. If the samples lower than 3% were considered to be zeros, the beta pdf that
would be obtained would pass the chi-square test. In that case, the histogram would be that in
Fig.6.4(b). The parameters obtained assuming those samples to be zero were the ones adopted
to generate the simulated cases. Likewise, the pdf of the same symptom, “RXLEV DL”, given
causes “hardware” and “transmission fault” and the pdf of symptom “RXLEV UL” given causes
“hardware”, “lack of coverage” and “transmission fault”, although passed the chi-square test,
could be better ﬁtted if low value samples were not considered in the approximation. Fig.6.5-6.9
shows the histogram built without rejecting low value samples (on the left) and assuming that
samples lower than 3% are zero (on the right). Table A.6 shows the parameters of the beta pdfs
for both options.
Symptom 17, “Link imb”, can be modelled as described on page 104. The histograms and
the modelled pdfs for that symptom given the diﬀerent causes are shown in Fig.6.10. Instead
of the previous pdfs, in order to simplify the model, the pdfs of symptom 17 conditioned to
causes have been modelled as beta pdfs (in black in Fig.6.10). P-P plots and chi-square tests
have demonstrated that the approximation with beta pdfs is quite good. For some of the causes
it can be observed that the approximations with beta pdfs is even more accurate than those
following page 104.
Figures in Appendix B shows in blue the normalized histograms for the data from the cellular
network and in red the estimated pdfs for all pairs symptom / cause. The bins for the histograms
were in each case those used for the chi-square tests, that is, the number of samples in each bin
was at least 5. Corresponding P-P plots (for the beta component of the pdf) are also depicted
on the ﬁgures. Delta components are not displayed on the ﬁgure. Symptoms whose delta was
higher than 0.9 are not represented in Appendix B.
Finally, pdfs with parameters deﬁned in Tables A.4 and A.5, which were used to generate
the simulated cases, are presented in Appendix C. Those ﬁgures can be used to determine which
causes are related to each symptom. For example, Fig.6.11 shows the percentage of samples in
the UL with level lower than -100 dBm given the diverse causes. In the ﬁgure, it can be noticed
that the value of this symptom is increased when there is a lack of coverage or a hardware fault.
If the population follows the hypothesized distribution, X2
0 follows, approximately, a chi-square distribution
with k −p −1 degrees of freedom, where p represents the number of parameters of the hypothesized distribution
estimated by sample statistics, which is 2 in the case under study (a and b). The hypothesis that the distribution
of the population is the hypothesized distribution should be rejected if the calculated value of the test statistic
X2
0 > X2
α,k−p−1, where α is the signiﬁcance level, that is the probability of rejecting the hypothesis when it is
true.

Prototype tools and ﬁeld tests
During years 2001 and 2002, a cooperation agreement was set between a network operator
(who’s name has to be kept conﬁdential), a manufacturer of network equipment (Nokia) and an
university department (Ingenier´ıa de Comunicaciones, University of M´alaga) in order to develop
and test some prototype tools and models for diagnosis of cellular networks. In this project, my
responsibility was the research part of the project and the speciﬁcations of the prototype tools. In
addition, I was also involved in other tasks, such as follow-up of trials and management meetings.
The main results of that project will be brieﬂy summarized in this section. They comprises the
implementation of two prototype tools: a knowledge acquisition tool and a troubleshooting tool,
and the evaluation of the tools and models in a live network. It should be pointed out that by
that time this thesis was in its beginnings and most of the methods proposed in it were still not
developed. Thus, the deployed system was based on knowledge only.
6.3.1
Knowledge acquisition
A knowledge acquisition tool, which was named KAT [36, 87], was built following the method
explained in Section 5.7. The aim of KAT was to assist network planners and troubleshooting
experts in the creation of diagnosis models. The user could deﬁne models without the require-
ment of prior knowledge on BNs thanks to an user interface. From the information supplied,
KAT automatically created BNs with two possible structures: SBM and Noisy-OR.
One of the key issues for testing KAT with the experts was the usability.
That is, the
user interface of the ﬁrst versions of KAT was so complex that the experts preferred to use a
spreadsheet for model speciﬁcation. Therefore, much of the eﬀort was applied to simplifying
the user interface, taking into account the users’ opinion. Fig.6.12 shows one snapshot of KAT
corresponding to the “Project Window”.
Another problem was found in the deﬁnition of probabilities for conditions. At the beginning,
MENÚ
SALIR

174
CHAPTER 6. RESULTS
Figure 6.12: KAT: Project window with symptom view selected
the user was required to specify prior probabilities of conditions, prior probabilities of causes
and conditional probabilities of causes given conditions. This deﬁnition is redundant because
probabilities of causes can be obtained from probabilities of conditions and probabilities of causes
given conditions. The reason for asking for the three types of probabilities was to homogenize
probability deﬁnition, that is, in this way prior probabilities of causes were speciﬁed for all causes,
not only for those causes without parent conditions. After the user speciﬁed the probabilities,
conditional probabilities were automatically changed so that the probabilities of causes were
the deﬁned ones by minimizing the square root error of the deﬁned conditional probability [37].
In the tests with the users, this methodology was perceived as very confusing because they
did not understand why the deﬁned probabilities were changed. Therefore, the conclusion was
that, even if the deﬁnition was not homogenous for all causes, it was better not to ask for prior
probabilities of causes that had parent conditions.
6.3.2
Troubleshooting Tool
Within the Nokia agreement, a prototype troubleshooting tool (TST) [39, 108] was also devel-
oped (Fig.6.13). The user had to supply the following information to the TST:
• Fault case, e.g. congestion, high drop call-rate, etc., which determined the Bayesian model
to use.
• Cells to be analyzed (e.g. top-10 bad performing cells according to statistics collected).
Normally this is automatically fed by the Fault Detection system.
• Date of the analysis, together with the averaging method used to calculate the performance
statistics (busy hour, 24 hours data, ...).
When the previous information was entered into the tool, the user was asked for those data
that could not be automatically collected from network statistics (e.g. weather condition, cell

density, etc.). Next step was to run the analysis or schedule it, e.g. run TST during early
hours of the morning so that analysis was ready when engineers came in the morning. During
the analysis the TST collected data from all sources speciﬁed in the model (databases, alarms,
etc.). When the data collection ﬁnished, the TST performed the reasoning, based on the selected
Bayesian model, and it calculated the probability of each possible cause being the one causing
the problem(s). The TST presented, for each cell, the list of possible causes of the problem
ranked by their eﬃciency (function of the probability and the cost of the action required to
solve the problem).
All the collected evidence related to symptoms could be displayed or saved locally in text
format. The user could also save his own feedback on the problem cause together with the results
of the analysis. This information could be utilized to verify whether the solution provided by
the tool was the right one.
6.3.3
Trial in a live GSM/GPRS network
As part of the Nokia agreement, a model for diagnosis in GSM/GPRS was developed based
on the expertise of troubleshooters from the operator, on knowledge of personnel from network
planning services in Nokia and on the guidance from people in the project at Nokia and at the
university. The TST was deployed in a live network and the model was ﬁne tuned while it was
tested to diagnose faulty cells. The causes, symptoms and conditions included in the model are
presented in Tables D.1, D.3 and D.2, respectively.
MENÚ

176
CHAPTER 6. RESULTS
The trial4 in the live network had a duration of about six months. Results of the trial are
presented in two phases: “Trial 1”, which includes partial results at the middle of the trial
period; and “Trial 2”, which includes ﬁnal results at the end of the trial period. The main
evaluated aspects were the diagnosis accuracy, the time to carry out troubleshooting and the
usability of the tools.
Troubleshooting experts analyzed the faulty cells and the assessed diagnosis was compared
with that provided by the TST. Cases were classiﬁed in four groups:
• Unknown diagnosis
– On going: Analysis was started by the experts, but it was not completed, i.e. the
correct cause was not yet known.
– Inconclusive: The real cause of the problem was unclear and it was not possible to
sort it out by the experts. Therefore, it was not possible to know if the analysis done
by the TST was correct.
• Known diagnosis
– Correct: The analysis done by the TST gave the right cause, which was veriﬁed and
conﬁrmed by the experts.
– Incorrect: The analysis done by the TST provided the wrong cause, when the experts
knew the correct answer.
Figure 6.14 shows all causes proposed by the TST, classiﬁed into the previous four categories.
Results show that there were 23 cases out of 55 where the correct cause was known by the
experts. The right cause was proposed 11 times (47.8%) by the TST and in 12 times the TST
gave incorrect causes (52.2%). A deeper analysis is presented in Table 6.4 for those 23 cases
where the user knew the correct answer. The column Number of cases shows the number of
cells in which the corresponding cause was identiﬁed. The label for the cause is indicated by a
number, whose corresponding cause is shown in Table D.1. From those results, it can be observed
that for some causes (12, 24 and 27) the diagnosis accuracy was 100%. On the contrary, for
some causes (9 and 25) the performance of the TST was very bad, indicating some problems in
the model.
Consequently, the model was ﬁne-tuned during the following three months. The results at
the end of that period are shown in Fig.6.15 and Table 6.5. From these results, it can be observed
that the amount of cases where the cause was known by the expert was increased from 42% to
66%. It can also be noticed that the number of diagnosed causes in those cases (9) was higher
than that of ﬁrst period (7). As in results on the ﬁrst period, there were some causes which
were very well spotted by the TST. However, almost no improvement was achieved for causes 9
and 25. The total diagnosis accuracy was increased from 48% to 61%.

The achieved diagnosis accuracy (61%) was considered to be quite promising by all partners
(operator, manufacturer and researchers). It was realized that ﬁne-tuning of the model was
essential, not only to adjust the parameters in the model, but also to identify new causes and
symptoms. However, the ﬁne-tuning process was considered as very time-consuming.
Another analyzed aspect of the TST performance was the time it took to make the analysis.
During the trial it was measured that the time that the TST took to carry out the diagnosis was
from one minute to ﬁve minutes per cell, depending on the NMS load. Compared to the regular
human troubleshooting time, this signiﬁcantly reduced on regular human troubleshooting time,
which can last several days for the most complex cases. Even with an incorrect cause suggestion
by the TST, the analysis results provide extremely valuable clues to the troubleshooting experts.
This proves to be quite large time saving.
Regarding the usability of the tool, the general feeling was that the TST was easy to use
and no major problems were encountered. The feedback provided on the usability was used to
highly improve the TST.
Finally, the trial allowed to get a basic idea of the fault causes that could be investigated
further. The TST presented a summary of the abnormal symptoms, which helped to verify the
diagnosed cause. Therefore, the automatic diagnosis system was recognized as very valuable
and time-saving by all partners.

the time required by the automated diagnosis system (seconds) is much lower than that needed
by a human expert (one hour in average, even days in some cases) to provide a diagnosis. The
results per cause are depicted in Fig.6.16.
In that ﬁgure, it can be observed (type I error)
that most errors in classiﬁcation occur when the fault cause is a HW fault or a transmission
fault. This is reasonable, since HW and transmission related alarms have not been considered
by the designed diagnosis system. If those data had been available, the whole performance of
the diagnosis system would have been considerably improved. From Fig.6.16, it can also be
appreciated (type II error) that most incorrectly classiﬁed cases are diagnosed as having a lack
of coverage.
Results for Experiment 2 are presented in Table 6.8. Comparing the obtained accuracy when
varying the size of the training set (Ntrain= 50 or 5000), it can be concluded that the system
performance is highly degraded when the number of training examples is scarce. This pinpoints
a drawback of diagnosis systems based on the BC, which will be further investigated in the
following section: although the achieved accuracy could be high, to do this a large database of
training cases is required. Average ﬁgures of merit per fault cause are shown in Fig.6.17. As
expected, for small training sets, type I errors are especially high (almost 100%) for those causes
whose prior probabilities are lower.
Dependency with the size of the training set
The following experiment (Table 6.9) studied the dependency of the performance on the size of
the training set. With that purpose, training sets of increasing sizes were generated, from 100 to

the size of the training set can be clearly appreciated in the ﬁgure. In this experiment, from 500
cases downwards the accuracy rapidly decreases.
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity of the BC to imprecise deﬁnition of the model parameters was also empirically
measured (Table 6.10). Log-odd normal random noise was added to the mean and/or to the
standard deviation of the beta pdfs, emulating the eﬀect of imprecision in their deﬁnition (see
Section 6.1.3). Fig.6.19 shows the average diagnosis accuracy depending on the level of noise.
It can be observed that, for large levels of noise, the accuracy is more sensitive to imprecision
in the mean of the beta pdfs that to imprecision in the standard deviation. However, for low
level of noise, the sensitivity is very similar. It can be concluded that the BC is quite sensitive
to imprecision in the parameters of the model. The accuracy for no noise is 82%. For small
imprecision (σ = 0.1) in both the mean and the standard deviation, accuracy is 70.5%. For
σ = 0.2, the accuracy is 50% and for σ = 0.3, it is already 33%.

Summary
When the parameters of the BC are accurate, either because they have been obtained based
on a large database of training examples or they have been precisely elicited by experts, the
diagnosis accuracy obtained with the BC is very high. The main drawback of the BC is that
performance rapidly decreases if the parameters are incorrect due the the inherent uncertainty
of diagnosis experts or due to a reduced number of training examples.

SBM versus Noisy-OR
Figures of merit
The aim of the experiments (Table 6.11) presented in this section was to compare the perfor-
mance of two diagnosis system: the ﬁrst one was based on a BN with a SBM structure and
the second one was based on a BN following Noisy-OR assumptions [45]. For both models,
symptoms were modelled as binary random variables.
Results of Experiment 1 are shown in Table 6.12, whereas ﬁgures per cause are depicted in
Fig.6.20. Diagnosis accuracy is only slightly higher for the Noisy-OR (68.3%) than for the SBM
(67.2%). Thus, the conclusion is that the behavior is similar for both structures5.
Results for Experiment 2 are presented in Table 6.13. Again, the achieved accuracy for both
BN structures is so close that it is not possible to state that one structure is better than the
other one.
Therefore, the conclusion is that the SBM is preferred to the Noisy-OR because results are
similar and the former is much simpler. However, in the test sets, only a single cause was taken
place at the same time. In the future it should be tested whether the Noisy-OR outperforms
the SBM in the simultaneous presence of more than a fault.
5In order to test the statistical signiﬁcance of the results, a test to compare two proportions [141] was applied.
The null hypothesis was that the Noisy-OR model achieved the same performance as the SBM. The value of
the test statistic was 0.41, which is within the interval, (1.96,-1.96), calculated for a conﬁdence level of 95%.
Therefore, according to the test, we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
That means that there is insuﬃcient
evidence to support the claim that the Noisy-OR model outperforms the SBM.

Dependency with the size of the training set
Fig.6.21 shows the dependency of the average diagnosis accuracy with the size of the training
set for the two BN structures under test (Experiment 3 on Table 6.14). From approximately 500
onwards, the SBM outperforms the Noisy-OR BN, although the diﬀerences are not meaningful
enough. It should be noticed that the training and test cases have been generated based on the
same assumptions as those of the SBM, which can explain the better performance of the SBM
structure when the training set size is large.
Sensitivity analysis
Experiment 4 (Table 6.15) studied the sensitivity to imprecise parameters of the diagnosis ac-
curacy obtained with both structures.
In Fig.6.22(a), it can be observed that there are no
meaningful diﬀerences in the behavior of the structures in the presence of inaccurate thresholds.
However, in Fig.6.22(b), it can be appreciated that the Noisy-OR structure is more sensitive to
imprecise deﬁnition of prior probabilities than the SBM. With regard to conditional probabil-
ities of symptoms given causes (Fig.6.22(c)), sensitivity is similar for both structures. Finally,
Fig.6.22(d) presents the sensitivity analysis when noise is added to all the parameters (thresh-

olds and probabilities). The conclusion from Fig.6.22(d) is that there are not clear beneﬁts of
the Noisy-OR structure over the SBM with regard to sensitivity to imprecise parameters.
Summary
It has been shown that when only a single cause is present (which is normally the case in the
domain under study), the SBM and the Noisy-OR structures give similar results, taking into
account not only the accuracy, but also their sensitivity to imprecise model parameters. The
simplicity of the SBM in comparison with the Noisy-OR leads to the conclusion that the SBM
should be preferred for diagnosis in cellular networks. However, in the future, experiments with
two simultaneous causes should be carried out to support or reject this statement.
6.4.3
Learning of model parameters
The experiments presented in this section were aimed to evaluate the algorithms presented in
Chapter 5 for parameter learning. Those methods are used to calculate the quantitative part
of the model, i.e. thresholds for the discretization and probabilities for the BN. The BN was a
SBM with two-value symptoms. Therefore, continuous performance indicators were discretized
into two states.
The ﬁrst type of experiments was aimed at testing the working mechanisms of the dis-
cretization algorithms. The reduction in complexity of SEMD in comparison with EMD was
also quantiﬁed. The second class of analysis was focused on comparing the algorithms for prob-
ability deﬁnition. Finally, the performance of the diagnosis systems obtained after applying the
proposed algorithms was studied. The ﬁgure of merit was the diagnosis accuracy. In a domain
such as cellular networks, where the number of classiﬁed cases is very limited, the fact that an
algorithm achieves a high performance even with a reduced training set has been considered a
quality measure. This is the reason why the behavior of the diﬀerent methods was analyzed
depending on the number of training cases.
Table 6.16 shows the relations between causes and symptoms assumed for the experiments
(e.g. for the SEMD and BMAP algorithms).

Discretization methods
Firstly, the thresholds obtained with the diﬀerent algorithms proposed in Chapter 5 have been
compared. For example, Fig.6.23 shows the theoretical pdfs of the symptom 12, “ratio of down-
link quality samples out of band 0”, conditioned to the diﬀerent causes. Thresholds obtained
with the diﬀerent discretization methods are also depicted in that ﬁgure. In this example, the
number of cases in the training set was 1000. The diﬀerence in the threshold values can be
clearly appreciated in the ﬁgure, although no rule can be followed to select one of the thresholds
among the others.
Table 6.17 compares the thresholds obtained with the diﬀerent discretization methods. The
average of thresholds over all symptoms has been calculated using 50 diﬀerent training sets. In
Table 6.17, the average of the average of the thresholds and the average of the standard deviation
of the thresholds is shown depending on the number of cases in the training set (|D|). It can be
observed that the value obtained with SEMD gets closer to that achieved with EMD as the size
of the training set is increased.
In order to study the behavior of the entropy methods, the entropy for two symptoms has
been depicted versus the boundary cut point (Fig.6.24). It has been calculated as eq.(5.31)
according to EMD, for diﬀerent sizes, |D|, of the training set. The minimum value for each
curve, which corresponds to the best threshold, is also outlined in the ﬁgure. The symptom

(b) A bis component in Drop Call Rate
Figure 6.24: Class entropy versus boundary cut point
in Fig.6.24(a) is the “percentage of samples with uplink signal level lower than -100 dBm”
(RXLEV UL), which is directly related to causes “lack of coverage” and “hardware fault”. In
Fig.6.24(a), it is worth noting that entropy curves almost coincide, regardless of the diﬀerent
sizes of the training sets. However, for the symptom shown in Fig.6.24(b), “A-bis component
in Dropped Call Rate” (A-bis dcr), curves corresponding to diﬀerent sizes of the training set
are not so close as in Fig.6.24(a). The explanation to those diﬀerences is the fact that for the
symptom in Fig.6.24(a) the related causes are the faults in approximately half of the cases in
the training sets. On the contrary, the only cause directly related to the symptom presented in
Fig.6.24(b), “transmission failure”, have a prior probability of only 0.04. That means that the
number of cases whose cause was “transmission fault” in a small training set is normally very
scarce. Entropy curves for SEMD are similar to those in Fig.6.24.
The following experiments compared the complexity of SEMD versus EMD. As described
on page 120, the complexity of SEMD is
2
K times that of EMD, where K is the number of
causes. Furthermore, the complexity of EMD depends on the number of boundary cut points
to be evaluated.
Table 6.18 presents the number of boundary points (averaged over all the
symptoms) for training sets of diﬀerent sizes. The table also shows the complexity of EMD and
SEMD, measured as the number of multiplications in the algorithms. In this example, K = 7,
thus
2
K = 0.286. It can be appreciated that the reduction in complexity is large enough to
justify the use of SEMD over EMD even in situations where the accuracy achieved with SEMD
is slightly lower than that of EMD. This advantage will be more evident for networks with a
high number of causes, which is normally the case. A reduced complexity is especially important
when thresholds are frequently calculated. If the network is stable and thresholds are computed
only occasionally, complexity is not so crucial.

Probability deﬁnition
The aim of the experiments presented hereafter was to compare the probabilities obtained with
the diﬀerent methods proposed in Section 5.5.2. 5000 training cases were the base to obtain
a set of thresholds, according to the EMD method, and a set of probabilities, according to
MEST. Those probabilities, which were named standard probabilities, were compared with the
probabilities obtained following each of the algorithms. Probabilities obtained with all methods
based on data coincide asymptotically, thus the algorithm selected to calculate the standard
probabilities is irrelevant as long as the number of cases is enough. The root mean square error
over all the probabilities in the BN was computed as
E =
v
u
u
u
t
M
P
k=1
(tk −sk)2
M
(6.5)
where M stands for the number of probabilities in the BN, tk are the probabilities to be compared
and sk are the standard probabilities.
Table 6.19 shows the expected value of E (obtained by doing the average over 50 diﬀerent
training sets) depending on the size of the training set (|D|). In this case, M = 168, which
corresponds to 24 symptoms and 7 conditional probabilities per symptom (due to the 7 causes).
In this calculus, for each symptom, only the probability of one of the states was considered,
as the probability of the second state is directly derived from the probability of the ﬁrst one.
In table 6.19, it can be observed that for large training sets all methods but the one based
on knowledge achieve similar errors in probability estimation. However, for reduced number
of training cases, MEST outperforms the other methods. It should be pointed out that the
training cases used to calculate the standard probabilities were diﬀerent to the ones used in the
experiments. This explains that the error is diﬀerent to zero for the MEST method and 5000
training cases.
Figures of merit
The aim of the following experiments (Table 6.20) was to compare the diagnosis accuracy
achieved with the diﬀerent methods proposed in Chapter 5 for probability and threshold calcu-
lations. Two scenarios were distinguished depending on the number of available training cases:
50 or 5000 cases.

CHAPTER 6. RESULTS
Experiments 1 and 2 used network cases as test set. In Experiment 1, the performance of the
systems was studied when the number of training cases was scarce (Fig.6.25). On the contrary,
Experiment 2 used large training sets (Fig.6.26). In the ﬁgures, it can be observed that the
best results are achieved when the MEST algorithm is applied to estimate the BN probabilities,
specially when the number of training cases is scarce. For a large number of training cases
(Fig.6.26), all methods based on training data presents a similar behaviour. In addition, the
standard deviation of the diagnosis accuracy obtained with the MEST method is smaller than
those achieved with the other methods.
Regarding the discretization methods, diﬀerences among the methods are in most cases neg-
ligible. When the number of training cases is scarce (Fig.6.25), it can be observed that the
ranking of the discretization method depends on the applied algorithm for probability calcu-
lation. For a large number of training cases (Fig.6.26) the data-based discretization methods
outperform the method based on human expertise. Furthermore, EMD and SEMD are slightly
better than BMAP. However, the standard deviation obtained with BMAP is the lowest one.
In Experiments 3 and 4, simulated cases were used as test sets. Results are presented in
Fig.6.27 and Fig.6.28 for small and large training sets, respectively.
In Fig.6.27, it can be
observed that the best performance was obtained when probabilities were estimated applying
the MEST method, regardless of the discretization technique, followed by BDF. On the contrary,
when probabilities were elicited by experts or obtained applying the MLE method, the error was
higher. In addition, in Fig.6.27(a) it can also be appreciated that SEMD outperforms the other
discretization algorithms when used in combination with MEST. In order to test the statistical
signiﬁcance of the previous results a binomial test [168] was applied. The hypothesis was that
the best results were achieved when the SEMD method was used to set the thresholds and the
MEST algorithm was applied to deﬁne the probabilities in the BN. When the MEST algorithm
was used, SEMD proved to outperform the other discretization methods (at least at the 90%
conﬁdence level) in 74% of the experiments for EMD, in 58.6% of the experiments for BMAP
and in 80.4% of the experiments for TEXP.
For large training sets (Experiment 4), the achieved diagnosis accuracy was similar for all
methods but for those based only on human expertise, which presented higher diagnosis error
(Fig.6.28).
Dependency with the size of the training set
The dependency of the results on the size of the training set was also studied (Table 6.21).
Fig.6.29(a) (Experiment 5) shows the diagnosis accuracy for the diﬀerent discretization tech-
niques when MEST was applied to obtain the probabilities. It can be clearly appreciated in
this ﬁgure that data-based techniques outperform the knowledge-based method. In addition, for
most training set sizes SEMD slightly outperforms EMD and BMAP. Accuracies achieved with
BMAP and SEMD are very similar, except for low number of cases. Fig.6.29(b) (Experiment
6) presents the diagnosis accuracy calculated using SEMD thresholds for the diverse methods
proposed for probability deﬁnition. Probabilities elicited by experts provide considerable worse

results than those calculated based on data. For large sizes of the training set (i.e. from 2000
cases onwards) it can be observed that MLE, MEST and BDF give similar results. Nevertheless,
for lower number of cases, MEST oﬀers the best accuracy, followed by BDF.
Summary
From the previous experiments, it can be concluded that the best diagnosis performance is ob-
tained by using methods based on data or on a combination of data and expertise. Furthermore,
the algorithm used for probability deﬁnition has proven to be more important than the method
used to calculate the thresholds.
When the number of cases in the training set is large, similar results are obtained with all
methods except for those based only on knowledge. In that case, the criterion to select the
system should be based on the simplicity of the solution. Therefore, when large training sets are

available we propose to use MEST or MLE, in combination with SEMD. On the contrary, when
the number of training cases is scarce, the MEST method (followed by the BDF algorithm) has
shown the best performance to deﬁne probabilities. Among the discretization techniques, SEMD
was outstanding when combined with MEST for small training sets. Due to the fact that it is
diﬃcult to determine from which size on a training set is considered large, we propose to use the
SEMD method for setting thresholds and the MEST algorithm for computing the probabilities,
regardless of the size of the training set.
In the extreme situation in which no data is available, the BMAP and BDF methods can
still be applied if the parameters a and b of the beta pdfs have been previously estimated by
diagnosis experts.
6.4.4
Prevention of imprecision in model parameters
Experimental design
The objective of the study on SBNs and MUI networks was two-fold: to compare their per-
formance, with diﬀerent degrees of smoothness and diﬀerent belief mapping functions, and to
evaluate their sensitivity to imprecise parameter setting.
Firstly, a discrete BN whose probabilities were elicited by experts (Table A.2) was built.
The thresholds were obtained from 5000 training cases using the SEMD method. The reason for
choosing data-based thresholds instead of knowledge based thresholds was that the thresholds
elicited by experts were very inaccurate because a feedback procedure was never done on the real
network. Secondly, several SBNs were designed based on the previous discrete BN. Likewise,
several networks following the MUI method were also deﬁned.
An example
As an example to better understand the behavior of SBNs and MUIs, let’s consider a case whose
real fault cause was interference in the downlink path. This case was diagnosed by a 2-state
BN, two SBNs (trapezoidal and rect-gaussian functions) and a 3-state MUI BN. In all cases,
the parameter p was set to 10%. The eﬀect of changing the threshold of a single symptom,
RXLEV DL, was studied.
In this case, the value of this symptom was 7.5% and the threshold was 6.4%, therefore in
the case of the 2-state BN, the symptom was in the second state. In the case of the MUI BN,
the symptom was in the middle state. The 2-state BN provided a probability of 34.31% for HW
fault and 34.29% for interference in DL. Although both probabilities are extremely close, the
cause was erroneously diagnosed as HW fault, following the criterion of selecting the cause with
the highest probability. A lack of coverage was incorrectly diagnosed by the MUI BN, whereas
both SBNs achieved a correct diagnostic. Fig.6.30 depicts the probability of the three causes
(lack of coverage (Cov), interference in the DL path (DL int.) and hardware fault (HW)) vs.
the value of the threshold for the RXLEV DL symptom. The diﬀerent shapes of the transition
band between states for each system can be clearly appreciated in the ﬁgure.

Figures of merit
The aim of these experiments (Table 6.22) was to compare the performance of a discrete BN to
various SBNs and MUI networks. Table 6.23 shows the average and standard deviation of the
achieved diagnosis accuracy for the 2-state BN, the SBNs and the MUI networks in Experiment
1 (simulated cases). Fig.6.31(a) depicts the average diagnosis accuracy. It can be observed that
in all cases, the proposed methods outperforms the traditional BN (rect). Another remarkable
aspect is that for a degree of smoothness of p = 10%, the rect-gaussian function (gaus) provides
a higher accuracy than the trapezoidal function (trap), which can be explained by the smoother
shape of the gaus function in comparison to the trap function. However, as p increases, the gain
in accuracy of gaus in comparison to trap decreases. For p = 10%, MUI outperforms SBNs. As
p increases, the accuracy achieved with MUI decreases. Finally, for p = 40%, SBNs outperform
MUI. It can be concluded that the diagnostic performance of BNs can be improved by the
proposed techniques, both SBNs and MUIs, but the gain depends on the mapping functions and
the degree of smoothness. The results of the analysis (Experiment 2 in Table 6.22) on cases
from the live network (Fig. 6.31(b)) are similar.
Impact of the degree of smoothness
In the previous experiments, it was observed that the performance depended on the degree of
smoothness, p. Experiment 3 (Table 6.24) aims to measure the inﬂuence of p on the diagnosis
results. Fig.6.32 shows the average diagnosis accuracy for rectangular (2-state BN), trapezoidal
and rect-gaussian belief mapping functions vs. p. For traditional BNs, the parameter p does not

exist, which explains the constant value of the accuracy for rect functions. For SBNs and MUI
BNs, it can be observed that the performance is improved in comparison to the traditional BN,
regardless of the p value. For SBNs, the accuracy does not increase further from approximately
p = 35% onwards. This can be explained by the limitation of the p parameter. For MUI, p
should not be too high because the accuracy decreases from approximately p = 10%. A gain of
up to 13% can be achieved by using SBNs or MUI BNs instead of the 2-state BN.
Fig.6.33(a) shows the diagnosis accuracy per cause vs. the p value for trapezoidal functions.
For rect-gaussian functions, the behavior is similar.
The inﬂuence of p is diﬀerent for each
cause, the total behavior being dominated by the most common cause (i.e. lack of coverage).
For example, for the cause “lack of coverage” an improvement of 47% in the accuracy is obtained
when p is changed from p = 0% to p = 40%. Nevertheless, in that case, the accuracy decreases
48% for the cause “faulty hardware”. Fig.6.33(b) shows the diagnosis accuracy per cause vs.
the p value for a MUI BN.
The type-I error per cause for the 2-state BN is presented in Fig.6.34. From Fig.6.33(a) and
6.34, it can be noticed that those causes that were in most cases misclassiﬁed by the 2-state BN,
i.e. lack of coverage, link and transcoder failure, are those whose accuracy increases the most

type-I error of the 2-state BN is not so clear for MUIs.
Sensitivity analysis
A model with reference parameters (Table 6.25) was taken as the starting point for the analysis
of sensitivity to imprecision in model parameters. Those parameters were selected because they
were considered to be the “optimum”, whereas the added noise represented the imprecision in
those parameters. In this analysis it is assumed that the probabilities are deﬁned independently
of the thresholds. Thus, the followed methodology consists in ﬁxing the parameters of one type
(either thresholds or probabilities) and adding noise to the other parameters. This method is
useful for knowledge-based models, in which parameters are independently speciﬁed6.
The sensitivity was separately analyzed for imprecision in the thresholds, in the prior prob-
abilities of causes and in the conditional probabilities of symptoms. In addition, analysis for
imprecision in all the parameters at the same time was also performed.
In Experiment 4, sensitivity analysis was carried out for a 2-state BN. Fig.6.35 shows the
average diagnosis accuracy vs. the level of noise σ. It can be clearly appreciated that the system
is almost unsensitive to imprecision in the prior probabilities.
On the contrary, the highest
sensitivity is related to imprecision in thresholds.
In Experiment 5, the behavior of BNs, SBNs and MUI networks in the presence of imprecise
parameters was compared (Fig.6.36). It can be observed that with no noise (σ = 0), the best
results are obtained with the 2-state BN. This is logical as the parameters in the model were
calculated to be the optimum for that model. SBNs and MUI networks introduce uncertainty
6On the contrary, in the algorithm described in Chapter 5 for parameter learning based on training data,
thresholds are ﬁrstly deﬁned. Afterwards, probabilities are calculated as functions of the thresholds.

about the state of the symptoms. In other words, they equalize the probabilities of the diﬀerent
states. The consequence is that the performance is worst with SBNs and MUI networks than
with the 2-state BN. However, as imprecision is added to the parameters, SBNs and MUI
networks outperform the 2-state BN. In Fig.6.36(a), it can be clearly observed that the 2-
state BN (rect) is the most sensitive to imprecision in the thresholds. Even with low level of
noise, SBNs and MUI networks outperform the 2-state BN. In addition, in the ﬁgure it can
also be appreciated that SBNs are less sensitive to imprecision in threshold deﬁnition than
MUI networks. SBNs with rect-gaussian functions outperform SBNs with trapezoidal functions
in presence of imprecision. Regarding prior probabilities of causes (Fig.6.36(b)), all networks
behave in a similar way. When only conditional probabilities are changed (Fig.6.36(c)), MUI
networks achieve the best diagnosis accuracy for medium and high levels of noise, whereas there
are no meaningful diﬀerences among the others. Fig.6.36(d) presents the realistic situation in
which all parameters present some degree of imprecision. It can be noticed that the behavior is
dominated by the imprecision in thresholds. Therefore, in the presence of uncertainty the best
results are obtained with SBNs with rect-gaussian functions, followed by SBNs with trapezoidal
functions. The worst diagnosis accuracy corresponds to traditional BNs. Experiments were
repeated for the network cases. The obtained results are the same ones as those presented above
for the simulated cases.
Finally, the inﬂuence of the degree of smoothness on the sensitivity to imprecise parameters
was analyzed. Fig.6.37 presents the sensitivity to changes in all the parameters for a SBN with
diﬀerent degrees of smoothness.
Summary
SBNs has proven to outperform traditional BNs when there is certain degree of inaccuracy in the
model parameters. However, when the parameters are calculated based on large databases of
training data, BNs are preferred. Among the analyzed functions, rect-gaussian are less sensitive
than trapezoidal functions to imprecise deﬁnition of parameters. The performance of SBNs is
inﬂuenced by the selected degree of smoothness. Thus, it is recommended to test the system in
the network before regular operation in order to choose the best possible p.

Discussion
In this chapter, it has been shown that each diagnosis systems proposed in this thesis has some
advantages and disadvantages. The main conclusions are summarized in Fig.6.38-6.40. In those
ﬁgures, the learning algorithms for BNs have been SEMD/mest.
The BC gives very good results when the parameters are good, in the sense that they are
ﬁtted to the cellular network under study.
Suitable parameters can be obtained if a large
database of training cases is available. In Fig.6.38, it can be observed that for a training set
of 5000 cases, the accuracy obtained with the BC is much higher than that obtained with the
other diagnosis systems. However, when the model parameters are inaccurate, the performance

Figure 6.37: Sensitivity analysis to imprecise model parameters for diﬀerent degree of smoothness
of the BC is highly degraded, as also shown in Fig.6.39 and 6.40. On the one hand, inaccurate
parameters can be due to a small training set. In Fig.6.40, it can be seen the steep slope of
the diagnosis accuracy of the BC when the size of the training set is reduced. On the other
hand, inaccuracy can be also present in knowledge-based systems. As shown in Fig.6.39, the
sensitivity of the BC to imprecise parameters is very high in comparison to the other proposed
systems.
Reasonable results can be obtained with BNs for medium and small sizes of training sets.
The SBM structure is preferred to the Noisy-OR structure because diagnosis accuracy is similar
for both structures and the SBM is much easier to implement. In Fig.6.38, it can be observed
that for a small training set (N = 50), the SBM outperforms the BC. This can be also noticed
in Fig.6.40, since from a certain size downwards the accuracy achieved with the SBM is higher
than that obtained with the BC. In addition, the behavior of BNs is more independent on the
training set size than that of the BC. On the contrary, results obtained with the SBM for large
training sets are much worse than those obtained with the BC.
Two diﬀerent tests have been performed with BNs. The ﬁrst one (knowledge-based BN),
depicted in green in Fig.6.39, is the results of the experiment presented in green in Fig.6.35. In
this test, it has been considered that thresholds and probabilities are both deﬁned by experts.
Thus, noise is independently added to thresholds and probabilities, simulating the inaccuracy
in both types of parameters. On the contrary, the curve in red in Fig.6.39 (data-based BN)
analyzes the sensitivity of the accuracy to imprecise parameters for data-based systems.
In
that case, according to the methods proposed in Chapter 5, thresholds are ﬁrst calculated and
then probabilities are computed depending on the value of the thresholds. Thus, in this test,
ﬁrstly the thresholds are determined by means of any discretization method. Secondly, noise
is added to the thresholds. Subsequently, probabilities are computed depending on the noisy
thresholds. Finally, noise is added to the probabilities. In this case, as expected, the accuracy

is less sensitive to inaccurate parameters than in knowledge-based BNs. This is due to the fact
that probabilities are calculated for the actual thresholds. In Fig.6.39, it can be observed that
in any case the SBM is less sensitive to imprecise parameters than the BC.
Finally, SBNs and MUI networks improve the accuracy obtained with knowledge-based BNs
when there is certain degree of imprecision in the parameters. For example, in Fig.6.39, the
smaller sensitivity of SBNs to imprecise parameters compared to knowledge-based BNs or BCs
can be observed.
In summary, some general recommendations extracted from these conclusions are the follow-
ing:
• When there is a large number of training examples available, the BC should be used as
diagnosis system.
• When the number of training examples is scarce, the diagnosis system should be based on
a BN with a SBM structure. The parameters of the model should be calculated using the
SEMD and mest algorithms.
• When there are no training cases, a BN should be built using the knowledge of diagnosis
experts. If the model parameter are not precise, which is normally the case, SBNs or MUI
networks should be used.

diﬃculties encountered and assesses the most important conclusions obtained in this thesis. In
addition, the main contributions are summarized and some future lines of work are suggested.
7.1
Results
In this thesis, a framework for automated fault diagnosis in cellular networks has been estab-
lished. The systems proposed in this thesis are intended to improve operational eﬃciency in
current and future networks, by means of the following beneﬁts:
• Automated troubleshooting (TS) reduces the time required to identify the fault cause in
cells with problems.
This means that network performance is enhanced as the down-
time and the time with reduced quality of service is signiﬁcantly limited. Consequently,
the number of unsatisﬁed users decreases and the threat posed by other cellular network
operators and other emerging technologies is counteracted.
• Thanks to the automation of TS procedures, operational costs are reduced because fewer
personnel with a lower skill level is required. This is due to the fact that the majority of
problems can be rectiﬁed with the help of the automated tool. The knowledge of highly
experienced staﬀ, which is released from this work, can be utilized for other aspects of
network optimization, thereby further increasing network performance.
• One of the main diﬃculties encountered in this thesis has been the lack of documentation
about fault management in cellular networks. The steps followed to diagnose the fault
cause in a cell are normally known only by a few experts who acquired that knowledge
from hand-on experience. Hence, one additional beneﬁt of the methods proposed in this
thesis is that the TS knowledge can be stored in the automatic tool, therefore making the
company less vulnerable to staﬀﬂuctuation.
Apart from the main “scientiﬁc” conclusions that were detailed in Section 6.5, it is important
to stress those engineering aspects learnt from working with cellular network operators. This

CHAPTER 7. CONCLUSIONS
may help anyone who attempt to create a similar system for cellular networks or any other
application domain in which a database of cases is not available. The most important issues to
take into account when building an automatic troubleshooting system are the following:
• A close cooperation between network operators, manufacturers of network equipment and
academic researchers has proved to be essential for the success of the project. On the one
hand, the contribution from network operators was the expertise in the application domain
(i.e. troubleshooting in the RAN of cellular networks). On the other hand, the researcher
contributed with her knowledge about artiﬁcial intelligence and cellular networks. The
manufacturer of network equipment was responsible of implementing prototype tools and
of the negotiations with the operators. Finally, the important task of bringing together
the theory on automatic systems and the expertise in TS was performed by the network
operator together with the researcher.
• When creating a knowledge-based model, a feedback cycle is required in order to ﬁne-tune
the model parameters:
1. Firstly, the artiﬁcial intelligence technique should be selected by the knowledge en-
gineers1. If BNs are chosen, then the structure of the BN should be deﬁned (e.g.
SBM).
2. Then, the model parameters should be provided by the experts in the application
domain (e.g. experts in fault management in the RAN) with the help of the knowledge
engineers or an automatic tool.
This stage, despite being conceptually simple, is
one of the most diﬃcult ones in model building.
The reason is that TS experts
are used to a language completely diﬀerent to the terms utilised by the knowledge
engineers. Consequently, it is recommended that knowledge engineers have also a
background in the domain under study (mobile communications in this case), so that
knowledge transfer can be simpliﬁed. In addition, the nature of the tasks performed
by TS experts prevented them from spending suﬃcient time building a model. This is
specially true if they do not see the immediate beneﬁts of having an automatic system.
In this phase, it is important to reduce the number of parameters that experts have
to specify.
3. Once the model is deﬁned, it has to be tested in a cellular network. That implies that
a prototype TS tool should be available at this stage. The model should be evaluated
on some faulty cells and its results should be compared with the diagnosis supplied
by an expert. If the diagnosis of the automatic tool is wrong, then the TS expert
together with the knowledge engineers should analyse which parameters of the model
should be changed so that the expected results are obtained. This procedure should
be repeated as many times as required. This can be a very time-consuming process.
1The knowledge engineer is a person, but could also be a computer program, that interprets the information
presented by experts in the application domain and deﬁnes a model based on that information.

7.2. GENERAL APPRAISAL
209
Thus, it requires a strong commitment from the operator so that experts do not give
up after analysing a few cases.
In conclusion, apart from the theoretical contributions, the importance of this thesis lies in
bringing together two completely separated worlds, such as theoretical research and operational
network management. For this task, it has been essential to cooperate with several parties, each
one with their own interests and ways to solve problems.
The relevance of the research is emphasized by the interest and involvement shown by some
cellular network operators, like Telef´onica or France Telecom, and manufacturers such as Nokia.
In addition, as a result of the work carried out in the agreement with Nokia and in the Gandalf
project [3, 2], a commercial troubleshooting tool, Moltsen TheCure [5], has been deployed.
7.2
General appraisal
From the very beginning, the research had a focused and easy to describe target: to design,
create and test an automated fault diagnosis system for the radio access networks of cellular
systems. Despite the simple target it proved far more diﬃcult to accomplish such task. Along
the development of the thesis the main problems that have had to be overcome have been the
following:
• The ﬁrst diﬃculty came from the multidisciplinary nature of the thesis: these ﬁelds were
too wide to go in great depth into every topic related to the thesis. On the contrary, most
of the research in telecommunication engineering is focused on a much narrower ﬁeld,
which requires looking into the ultimate mathematical or physical explanation of things.
Because of that, specially at the beginning of the thesis, the feeling of not knowing enough
of everything was very frustrating. Very often the main diﬃculty was knowing when to stop
doing research into a speciﬁc topic. Regarding mobile communication systems, studying
causes and symptoms that may happen in current cellular networks can be as complex as
desired. For example, the study of faults can either stop by knowing that a type of fault is a
hardware fault or the research can continue looking into which are the pieces of equipment
that can suﬀer a hardware fault. Another example: a symptom could be bad quality in the
uplink. Alternatively, it would have been possible to go one step further and deﬁne bad
quality as the number of samples out of quality band 0. Or the formula for the symptom
could be even deﬁned from counters in the Network Management System.
Regarding
artiﬁcial intelligence, the same challenge than those with mobile communications arose.
For example, in the area of BNs itself, many researchers are focusing on speciﬁc topics, e.g.
inference algorithms. Another example is discretization of continuous variables, which is
a main issue in machine learning. Therefore, an eﬀort was required to look at the thesis
from a system point of view, without going into too many details in every single topic.
• Another problem in the development of this thesis was the lack of related bibliography. Al-
though there are many books and journals related to current cellular networks (e.g.GSM,
MENÚ
SALIR

210
CHAPTER 7. CONCLUSIONS
GPRS, etc.), they are more focused on theoretical research in communications rather than
research regarding the operation of the network. This is due to several reasons. Firstly,
it seems that the main interests of the academic community are long-term research and
simulation-based studies regarding the theoretical performance of cellular networks. Thus,
network management is considered as a secondary topic since it is more related to current
networks rather than networks that will be deployed in the future. However, for equipment
manufacturers and network operators, network operation is one of the main concerns as it
is a main cost contributor. Although, they invest many resources in network management,
all activities related to the operation of their networks are normally considered highly con-
ﬁdential. In addition, due to the urgent nature of operation tasks, quite often operation
procedures are not documented and they are only known by those members of the staﬀ
working in this area. Consequently, very few references could be found on symptoms (Key
Performance Indicators and alarms), on base station equipment or on how diagnosis is
done in cellular networks. Thus, although the beginning of the thesis was a survey on the
state of the art, there were very few publications on the subject and the research had to be
conducted by interviewing network operators and manufacturers. In this sense, the collab-
orations with Nokia in the ﬁrst place and France Telecom at the end was very important.
On the contrary, references on diagnosis in other application ﬁelds were numerous. Hence,
considerable eﬀort was required to extract the information relevant for the thesis from the
varied existing documents on diagnosis and artiﬁcial intelligence.
• Another consequence of the conﬁdentiality of network operation was that evaluating the
systems proposed in the thesis was extremely diﬃcult. In fact, the thesis was facing huge
challenges when the evaluation of the proposed methods had to be initiated.
On the
one hand, there was not any Commercial oﬀ-the-shelf (COTS) software which simulated
the problems and symptoms required to test diagnosis systems in cellular networks. In
addition, designing a new simulator with the demanded accuracy would require a huge
eﬀort that could constitute a thesis by itself. On the other hand, obtaining data from
live networks was also a barrier because of the reluctance of network operators to provide
information from their networks. Even when an operator supplied a database with the
values of symptoms in some cells of a real network, this information still proved to be
insuﬃcient because no information was given about neither which were the cells experi-
encing problems nor the causes of those problems. Obtaining six hundred cases from a live
network (see page 158) was a milestone in the development of the thesis. Once those data
were available, algorithms could be developed to simulate any desired number of cases.
• Related to the two ﬁrst items (that is the multidisciplinary nature of the thesis, the lack
of interest of the academic community in network operation and the “system-approach”
followed in the thesis), it has also been very diﬃcult to ﬁnd proper journals in which to
publish the contributions of this thesis. Very often, submitted papers were returned in
short without being reviewed because they were out of the scope of the intended jour-
nal. Journals focused on mobile communications suggested to send the paper to journals
MENÚ

7.3. CONTRIBUTIONS
211
oriented to artiﬁcial intelligence, whereas artiﬁcial intelligence journals suggested telecom-
munication publications.
The aforementioned drawbacks are a consequence of the type of practical study developed
in this thesis. On the contrary, this applied research provided many satisfactions, such as:
• The work carried out can be considered as pure “engineering”, understanding engineering
as “the application of scientiﬁc and technical knowledge to solve human problems tak-
ing into account constraints, such as available resources, technical limitations, ﬂexibility
for future modiﬁcations, cost and producibility”[32]. In that sense, this type of applied
research can be considered a professional fulﬁlment for any engineer.
• The conclusions of the thesis are more tangible than ﬁnal results that may be obtained
from a more basic research. This is due to the clarity of the aim of the thesis and the
medium/short-term results that may be obtained from applying the proposed methodology.
• The chance of working in international projects, with staﬀfrom diﬀerent nationalities,
backgrounds and ways of thinking is invaluable. This, undoubtedly, has enriched the work
carried out in this thesis.
7.3
Contributions
The contributions presented in this thesis can be grouped in four subsets. A ﬁrst group consists
in the utilization of previously existing techniques in a new application domain and in the
compilation of information known by experts in diagnosis, but not reﬂected in the existing
literature:
• Several artiﬁcial intelligence techniques (Bayesian Classiﬁer, Bayesian Networks, discretiza-
tion methods, algorithms to determine probabilities, etc.) have been applied to the diag-
nosis of faults in the RAN of cellular networks. Those techniques were previously used for
the automatic diagnosis in other application ﬁelds and for the discretization or probabil-
ity assessment in the area of machine learning. However, this is the ﬁrst time that some
solutions have been proposed for automatic diagnosis in the RAN of cellular networks.
The second subset of contributions consists in the deﬁnition of a system for automatic fault
management in cellular networks:
• The architecture of an automatic diagnosis system for the RAN of cellular networks has
been proposed, i.e. the main elements and interfaces that the diagnosis system should
include and the scenario where it should be located.
• A knowledge base for diagnosis in current cellular networks (i.e. GERAN) has been deﬁned,
that is the main causes of excessive dropped call rate in these networks, their symptoms
and their related parameters have been identiﬁed.
MENÚ
SALIR

212
CHAPTER 7. CONCLUSIONS
The third subset of contributions comprises models and methods for automatic diagnosis.
Those models and methods are not only valid for current cellular networks (i.e. 2G and 2.5G),
but they can also be used for any other cellular network, such as 3G or multi-system networks.
Most techniques can even be utilized for diagnosis in applications outside the cellular networks
domain. In particular, the main contributions are:
• An approximation for the conditional pdfs of symptoms given the causes as beta pdfs has
been proposed. This model is based on the fact that pdfs for most symptoms represent
belief concerning a relative frequency.
• A BN structure, named Central Bayes Model, has been deﬁned. This structure allows the
representation of conditions as parent nodes of the causes, thereby being a more faithful
model of the causal relations in diagnosis than the Simple Bayes Model. This model is
feasible only if the number of conditions and their states are small.
• A novel discretization method based on entropy minimization, SEMD, has been proposed.
SEMD combines experience (i.e. which causes are related to each symptom) with training
data. This method has proven to achieve better diagnosis accuracy than EMD, another
entropy-based discretization method. In addition, the complexity of SEMD is lower than
that of EMD.
• A novel discretization method based on hypothesis testing, BMAP, has been proposed.
BMAP, like SEMD, combines experience with training data. This method can also be used
when no training data is available if the diagnosis experts specify the a and b parameters
of the beta pdfs.
• A method to determine the probabilities in a BN based on beta distributions, BDF, has
been proposed. Like BMAP discretization method, BDF may be applied when no training
data are available, but in that case diagnosis experts have to specify the a and b parameters
of the beta pdfs.
• Two techniques have been proposed in order to prevent inaccuracies due to imprecision
in model parameters.
One of the main beneﬁts of both techniques is that knowledge
acquisition and inference have the same complexity as in conventional BNs.
The ﬁrst
method, Smooth Bayesian Networks, applies likelihood evidence to soften the steep shape
of the probabilities around the thresholds. In addition, diﬀerent belief mapping functions
were proposed.
According to the second method, Multiple Uniform Intervals, 3-state
symptoms are built from the 2-state symptoms speciﬁed by experts.
• Speciﬁc knowledge acquisition procedures for diagnosis in cellular networks have been
proposed. The resulting generated model may be based either on a BC or on a discrete
BN, according to diﬀerent structures.
Finally, evaluation of the proposed techniques has been one of the most diﬃcult tasks in this
thesis. Because of the lack of databases with classiﬁed cases and simulation tools, algorithms
MENÚ
SALIR

7.4. FUTURE WORK
213
had to be designed to simulate diagnosis examples. In addition, methods had to be deﬁned to
test and compare the diﬀerent diagnosis systems. In summary, the main contributions in these
areas are:
• An algorithm has been proposed to generate simulated cases based on modelling the con-
ditional probabilities of symptoms as beta pdfs. Simulated cases may be used as training
sets or test sets for evaluating new classiﬁers.
• A method to empirically evaluate the sensitivity of diagnosis systems to imprecision in
the discretization of continuous symptoms has been suggested. That method is based on
previously existing algorithms for sensitivity analysis to inaccurate probabilities.
• A BC for diagnosis in current cellular networks has been designed and evaluated.
• Diﬀerent BN structures have been used to implement diagnosis systems for GERAN and
they have been tested and compared.
In addition, the proposed methods to prevent
imprecision in the BN parameters have also been evaluated.
• Diﬀerent techniques to estimate the probabilities in BNs and to discretize continuous
variables have been evaluated and compared.
• Some trials have been carried out in live GSM/GPRS networks. The TS tool has proved to
diagnose the fault cause faster than a human expert and with a similar diagnosis accuracy.
The obtained results, regarding the time to carry out the diagnosis, the accuracy and the
usability of the tool, conﬁrmed the feasibility of the diagnosis system based on BNs and
its ability to reduce operational costs.
7.4
Future work
Lines of research that might continue the work in this thesis can be grouped in three main sets:
• Improvement and ﬁne-tuning of the diagnosis model for current cellular networks:
– More trials in live networks would be helpful to reinforce the practical conclusions of
this thesis.
– An immediate complementary work would be to enlarge the diagnosis model for
current cellular networks by including more causes and symptoms.
• Diagnosis model for other RAN technologies: The logical continuation of the performed
studies is the application of the techniques proposed in this thesis to another RAN tech-
nologies, such as UMTS, WLAN or multi-system networks. Some work in this area has
been already started [33, 116, 184], e.g. a basic diagnosis model for UMTS based on a
SBM has been deﬁned.
• Diagnosis techniques:
MENÚ

214
CHAPTER 7. CONCLUSIONS
– In this thesis, it has been concluded that the performance of the SBM and the Noisy-
OR structures are similar under single fault assumptions. A line of future work is to
compare those BN structures when more than a cause takes place at the same time.
– In machine learning literature, several discretization algorithms can be found. In the
future, the feasibility of applying some of those methods to mobile communications
could be studied. In addition, those techniques could be compared with the ones
presented in this thesis.
– In the initial analysis of the state of the art, fuzzy logic was considered as an al-
ternative to BN for diagnosis in mobile networks. Future research may include the
application of fuzzy logic to the problem under study.

E.1
Introducci´on
E.1.1
Antecedentes y Justiﬁcaci´on
En el a˜no 2000, Nokia Networks inaugur´o un Centro de Ingenier´ıa de Sistemas de Comunicaciones
M´oviles en el Parque Tecnol´ogico de Andaluc´ıa (PTA). El proyecto se llev´o a cabo gracias a
un acuerdo de colaboraci´on entre la Universidad de M´alaga, en particular el Departamento de
Ingenier´ıa de Comunicaciones, y Nokia. El personal del Centro estuvo formado por trabajadores
de Nokia procedentes principalmente de Finlandia e Inglaterra, m´as de 50 personas de nueva
contrataci´on y profesores de la Universidad de M´alaga.
Como uno de los profesores que trabaj´o a tiempo parcial en Nokia, me integr´e en un nuevo
grupo de trabajo formado por otras tres personas en M´alaga, una en Inglaterra y una en Dina-
marca. El objetivo del grupo era dise˜nar un sistema automatizado de resoluci´on de problemas
para la Red de Acceso Radio (RAN) de sistemas de comunicaciones m´oviles. Por los motivos que
se expondr´an en E.1.2, Nokia consider´o prioritario abrir una l´ınea en este campo de investigaci´on.
Debido a que previamente trabaj´e en diagnosis de estaciones terrenas de seguimiento de
sat´elites [44, 41, 131] en la Agencia Espacial Europea (ESA), me pareci´o muy interesante incor-
porarme a esta l´ınea de investigaci´on. Por otra parte, la tarea era complicada y prometedora al
mismo tiempo, puesto que no exist´ıan estudios previos relacionados con la diagnosis en redes de
acceso de sistemas celulares. Adem´as, se trataba de un tema multidisciplinar para el que no s´olo
se requer´ıan conocimientos de comunicaciones m´oviles, sino tambi´en de inteligencia artiﬁcial.
Mi labor se desarroll´o en las propias instalaciones de Nokia en el PTA, siendo la responsable
de las tareas de investigaci´on del grupo.
Las funciones de los dem´as integrantes del equipo
inclu´ıan la gesti´on del proyecto, el desarrollo de aplicaciones y las relaciones con operadores de
redes de comunicaciones m´oviles.
La experiencia fue muy gratiﬁcante, no solamente me dediqu´e a la investigaci´on, sino que
estuve directamente implicada en la deﬁnici´on de prototipos de herramientas para la diagnosis
y en los contactos con operadores de telefon´ıa (realizando diversas reuniones con operadores en
Inglaterra y Dinamarca). Lamentablemente, en Junio de 2003 Nokia tuvo que tomar la decisi´on

pol´ıtica de cerrar el centro de M´alaga, con lo cual el proyecto se disolvi´o.
No obstante, la necesidad de herramientas autom´aticas de diagnosis segu´ıa existiendo y los
objetivos de mi tesis empezaban a estar claros. Por este motivo segu´ı investigando en el mismo
tema.
En Septiembre del 2003 el Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnolog´ıa aprob´o un proyecto de investi-
gaci´on dentro del Grupo Ingenier´ıa de Comunicaciones denominado “Desarrollo de herramientas
de optimizaci´on de los recursos radio en redes de comunicaciones m´oviles”, una de cuyas l´ıneas
es la diagnosis en la RAN.
Adem´as, desde el a˜no 2004 al 2007 he participado en un consorcio, entre los que han formado
parte, entre otros, France Telecom y Telef´onica I+D, para llevar a cabo un proyecto sobre
monitorizaci´on y autorregulaci´on de par´ametros de gesti´on de recursos radio (RRM) en una red
multi-sistema, que obtuvo la etiqueta CELTIC [1] dentro de la red europea EUREKA [4]. Este
proyecto ha incluido una tarea relacionada con la diagnosis en la RAN, de la que la Universidad
de M´alaga es responsable.
E.1.2
Formulaci´on del problema y objetivos
La industria de telecomunicaciones m´oviles est´a experimentando en los ´ultimos tiempos cambios
extraordinarios gracias a la introducci´on de nuevas tecnolog´ıas y servicios, y a los altos niveles
de competencia. En los pr´oximos a˜nos nuevas funcionalidades deber´an integrarse en las redes
actuales para permitir la convergencia de los sistemas celulares con Internet. En este escenario
de complejidad creciente, los operadores y fabricantes de equipos para comunicaciones m´oviles
est´an haciendo enormes esfuerzos para adaptar las redes celulares a las nuevas tecnolog´ıas y, al
mismo tiempo, mantener el nivel de servicio de las redes actuales. En consecuencia, la operaci´on
de la RAN es cada vez m´as complicada.
Adem´as, se vislumbra que en un futuro pr´oximo nuevas tecnolog´ıas van a revolucionar la
industria de telecomunicaciones. Por ejemplo, la expansi´on creciente de la telefon´ıa sobre IP,
la extensa disponibilidad de acceso WLAN y el lanzamiento de la telefon´ıa basada en dichas
tecnolog´ıas, est´a suponiendo una amenaza potencial para el negocio de los operadores de co-
municaciones m´oviles. Por tanto, estas empresas deben buscar formas de reducir sus gastos y
mejorar su calidad para hacer frente a la amenaza de las tecnolog´ıas emergentes.
En el pasado, los operadores consiguieron hacer frente a los r´apidos cambios tecnol´ogicos
incrementando su personal. Sin embargo, debido a las presiones ﬁnancieras, esta estrategia ya
no es factible y la ´unica opci´on viable para reducir los costes operacionales es aumentar el grado
de automatizaci´on. Por eso, actualmente dichos operadores est´an mostrando un enorme inter´es
por automatizar la gesti´on de la red, con el objetivo de incrementar la eﬁciencia operacional.
La automatizaci´on se puede aplicar en ´areas muy diferentes de la RAN de los sistemas celulares
[195, 186, 38, 194, 185, 125, 134, 135, 113, 177]: planiﬁcaci´on de frecuencias, deﬁnici´on de
adyacencias, resoluci´on de problemas, optimizaci´on de par´ametros, etc. Uno de los primeros
pasos en la automatizaci´on de la red es la resoluci´on de los problemas, ya que si una celda
temporalmente est´a fuera de servicio, el funcionamiento de las celdas vecinas probablemente

tambi´en se vea afectado, dando como resultado muchos clientes insatisfechos.
Hasta el momento la diagnosis de fallos ha sido una tarea manual, que requiere personal
dedicado de forma exclusiva al an´alisis de cientos de indicadores de funcionamiento de la red y
alarmas. Estos “expertos” en resoluci´on de fallos se encargan de diagnosticar cu´al es la causa de
los problemas que ocurren en ciertas celdas, de forma que puedan solucionarse lo antes posible.
El objetivo general de esta tesis es el dise˜no de un sistema autom´atico de diagnosis para
redes de acceso de sistemas celulares. Los objetivos espec´ıﬁcos son los siguientes:
• Aproximaci´on al problema. Como primera etapa, se debe llevar a cabo una investigaci´on
sobre la forma de realizar la gesti´on de fallos en las redes actuales. Adem´as, se deber´an
examinar diversas t´ecnicas dentro del campo de la inteligencia artiﬁcial para la diagnosis
autom´atica, que tengan en cuenta la incertidumbre inherente al razonamiento humano.
• Diagnosis en redes celulares. Se debe proponer un sistema de diagnosis autom´atico para
las actuales redes de comunicaciones m´oviles (GSM/GPRS). Para ello, se deben identiﬁcar
las principales variables a tener en cuenta y las relaciones entre ellas.
• Modelado de la diagnosis. Se deben proponer m´etodos para diagnosticar de forma au-
tom´atica la causa de los problemas en cualquier red celular. Dichos m´etodos utilizan un
modelo de diagnosis que representa el conocimiento sobre c´omo averiguar la causa de los
problemas. Como parte de este objetivo, se deben identiﬁcar los principales elementos del
modelo y sus par´ametros.
• Construcci´on del modelo. Para deﬁnir los par´ametros del modelo hay dos soluciones. Por
una parte, el modelo puede ser deﬁnido por expertos en la RAN. Por tanto, un objetivo
es estudiar c´omo convertir las especiﬁcaciones en lenguaje natural proporcionadas por los
expertos en modelos de diagnosis.
Esto se conoce como adquisici´on del conocimiento.
Por otra parte, el modelo se puede aprender a partir de ejemplos de entrenamiento. Por
eso, otro objetivo es desarrollar m´etodos para aprender autom´aticamente los par´ametros
a partir de dichos casos de entrenamiento.
• Evaluaci´on del modelo. El ´ultimo objetivo es dise˜nar t´ecnicas para evaluar y comparar los
sistemas de diagnosis.
Aunque en esta tesis los m´etodos que se proponen se aplican a redes GSM, ya que de ellas
se pueden obtener datos reales hoy en d´ıa, estas t´ecnicas son generales y, por tanto, pueden
aplicarse tambi´en a otros sistemas m´oviles, como UMTS.
El documento de la tesis se ha dividido en tres partes:
• Elementos del marco te´orico.
Esta fase exploratoria incluye dos aspectos principales:
revisi´on de literatura relacionada y resumen de los fundamentos te´oricos. A su vez, debido
al car´acter multidisciplinar de la tesis, esta parte se ha dividido en dos cap´ıtulos claramente
diferenciadas dentro de las disciplinas de comunicaciones m´oviles e inteligencia artiﬁcial.
En primer lugar es fundamental el estudio del estado actual de la automatizaci´on de
MENÚ

redes de comunicaciones m´oviles. En particular, se estudia c´omo se realiza actualmente la
diagnosis de fallos en redes de acceso GSM. El segundo cap´ıtulo se centra en el estudio de
t´ecnicas usadas para la diagnosis autom´atica en otros campos, con el objetivo de seleccionar
la(s) que se considere m´as apropiada(s) para los sistemas celulares.
• Una vez conocido el estado del arte, se pasa al dise˜no propiamente dicho del sistema
de diagnosis. La segunda parte de la tesis comprende tambi´en dos cap´ıtulos: diagnosis
en redes GSM y t´ecnicas para la diagnosis autom´atica. El primer cap´ıtulo consiste en
investigar las principales causas de problemas, sus s´ıntomas y otros factores relacionados en
GERAN. El segundo cap´ıtulo propone modelos y m´etodos, aplicables a cualquier sistema
celular, para llevar a cabo la diagnosis autom´atica.
• La tercera parte de la tesis se dedica a la evaluaci´on y comparaci´on de los modelos y
m´etodos propuestos en la segunda parte. Se expone tambi´en la metodolog´ıa seguida para
la obtenci´on de datos y su an´alisis. Finalmente se extraen conclusiones y se proponen
l´ıneas de acci´on futuras.
E.2
Estado del arte
La primera parte de la tesis presenta el marco te´orico en el que se sit´ua la tesis. Sus objetivos
son los siguientes:
• Presentar los fundamentos te´oricos sobre comunicaciones m´oviles y sistemas expertos nece-
sarios para comprender el resto de la tesis.
• Revisar la literatura sobre automatizaci´on en redes de comunicaciones m´oviles y diagnosis
autom´atica en otros campos de conocimiento.
• Presentar los conceptos m´as importantes que se utilizar´an a lo largo de la investigaci´on.
E.2.1
Automatizaci´on en redes de comunicaciones m´oviles
En la primera parte del Cap´ıtulo 2 se resumen los principios de los sistemas GSM, prestando
especial atenci´on a aquellos aspectos de GSM requeridos para seguir el resto de la tesis [142,
161, 162, 145, 90, 7].
A continuaci´on, se resalta la importancia de la automatizaci´on de las tareas de gesti´on de
red como la mejor forma de reducir costes operacionales en las actuales redes de comunicaciones
m´oviles de creciente complejidad [195, 134, 135, 113, 177, 90, 125].
Se describe en qu´e consiste la resoluci´on de problemas (troubleshooting, TS) en redes de
acceso de sistemas de comunicaciones m´oviles. Para ello, se explican cada una de las fases de
que consta el TS: identiﬁcaci´on de celdas con problemas, diagnosis, acciones para la resoluci´on
del problema. Se describe c´omo la mayor parte de los operadores realizan en la actualidad el TS
ayud´andose de un sistema de gesti´on de incidencias (troubleticket) [136, 139, 138], que permite
describir los fallos que aparecen en la red y asignar su resoluci´on a la persona o grupo m´as

adecuado para tratarlo. Asimismo se describe c´omo se realiza la diagnosis de fallos de forma
manual, con la ayuda de herramientas de visualizaci´on que permiten el an´alisis de los principales
indicadores de funcionamiento y alarmas.
Una vez justiﬁcada la necesidad de una herramienta autom´atica de diagnosis y comprendido
c´omo se lleva a cabo la diagnosis de forma manual, se describe en qu´e consistir´ıa la diagno-
sis autom´atica en redes celulares y el escenario en el que se localizar´ıa dicha herramienta au-
tom´atica. Posteriormente, se estudian los primeros pasos llevados a cabo en la automatizaci´on
de la resoluci´on de problemas: la detecci´on autom´atica de fallos [123, 124, 104, 133, 48, 47] y
la correlaci´on de alarmas [109, 202, 192, 84, 88, 193]. Aunque la correlaci´on de alarmas (in-
terpretaci´on de m´ultiples alarmas, de forma que se asigne un nuevo signiﬁcado a esas alarmas)
puede entenderse como un primer paso en la diagnosis de fallos, normalmente las alarmas no
proporcionan informaci´on concluyente para identiﬁcar la causa de los problemas, especialmente
si los problemas no son s´olo fallos en equipos. Otras categor´ıas de fallos, como interferencia
o falta de cobertura, son dif´ıciles de identiﬁcar si no se consideran tambi´en los indicadores de
funcionamiento. Finalmente se revisan los estudios llevados a cabo sobre diagnosis autom´atica
en otras ´areas de conocimiento, como la medicina [34, 146, 99, 199, 35, 154, 147, 144] o el n´ucleo
de redes de comunicaciones [115, 182, 190, 73].
E.2.2
T´ecnicas para la diagnosis autom´atica
En el Cap´ıtulo 3, se realiza un estudio sobre t´ecnicas usadas para la diagnosis autom´atica
en otras ´areas de conocimiento, en particular, se investigar´an aquellos sistemas basados en el
conocimiento capaces de modelar la incertidumbre (teor´ıa de Dempster-Shafer [72, 169], l´ogica
borrosa [205, 65], factores de certidumbre [172, 52, 92], redes bayesianas [157, 110, 54, 64], etc.).
De entre todas estas t´ecnicas se justiﬁca la elecci´on de la aproximaci´on bayesiana adoptada en
esta tesis. En la segunda parte del cap´ıtulo, se presenta una breve introducci´on a las Redes
Bayesianas.
E.3
Modelado de la diagnosis de fallos
En la segunda parte de la tesis se presentan sus principales aportaciones. El objetivo es dise˜nar
un sistema de diagnosis para la RAN de sistemas de comunicaciones m´oviles, el cual se compone
de dos partes fundamentales: un modelo y un m´etodo de inferencia.
El modelo representa
el conocimiento del experto sobre el dominio de aplicaci´on, en este caso el conocimiento de
expertos sobre c´omo se lleva a cabo la identiﬁcaci´on de la causa de los problemas en la RAN.
Hay dos aspectos involucrados en la construcci´on del modelo: la informaci´on sobre el dominio de
aplicaci´on (base de conocimiento) y su representaci´on. El m´etodo es el algoritmo de inferencia
que identiﬁca la causa de los problemas bas´andose en la evidencia disponible.
Aunque la base de conocimiento estudiada es la relacionada con la diagnosis en redes
GSM/GPRS, los modelos y m´etodos que se proponen son tambi´en v´alidos para otros sistemas
celulares con s´olo cambiar los elementos del modelo.

APPENDIX E. SUMMARY (SPANISH)
El Cap´ıtulo 4 estudia la base de conocimiento sobre diagnosis en redes GSM/GPRS, es
decir, se analiza en qu´e consiste la diagnosis en este tipo de redes. En el Cap´ıtulo 5 se investigan
representaciones del modelo y m´etodos bayesianos para la construcci´on del sistema de diagnosis.
E.3.1
Diagnosis en redes GSM/GPRS
Introducci´on
En primer lugar se deﬁnen los principales conceptos que se utilizar´an en este cap´ıtulo (problema,
fallo, causa, s´ıntoma, etc.).
La tesis se centra en la diagnosis de las causas cuando el problema es un elevado n´umero
de llamadas ca´ıdas. La tasa de llamadas ca´ıdas es uno de los principales indicadores de fun-
cionamiento usados por los operadores, ya que una llamada ca´ıda puede tener un impacto muy
negativo en el servicio ﬁnal ofrecido al cliente. Se estudian distintas ﬁguras de m´erito usados
por los operadores para medir las llamadas ca´ıdas.
Causas
A continuaci´on se analizan las principales causas, relacionadas con la RAN, que en un sistema
GSM/GPRS provocan una tasa elevada de llamadas ca´ıdas: falta de cobertura, interferencia,
fallos hardware, fallos de transmisi´on, etc.
S´ıntomas
En esta secci´on se estudiar´an los s´ıntomas considerados para la diagnosis, tanto indicadores
de funcionamiento como alarmas. El Sistema de Gesti´on de Red (Network Management Sys-
tem, NMS) almacena diariamente los indicadores de funcionamiento m´as importantes, gracias
a contadores situados en diversos puntos de la red. Adem´as, el NMS proporciona informaci´on
sobre cientos de alarmas de los elementos de la red. Cuando una de las causas descritas en la
secci´on anterior provoca una tasa elevada de llamadas ca´ıdas en una celda, los valores de algunos
indicadores de funcionamiento cambian respecto a sus valores nominales y diversas alarmas se
disparan. Los principales indicadores de funcionamiento se relacionan con la calidad y nivel de
la se˜nal recibida, causas de traspasos, etc.
Condiciones
Por ´ultimo, se describen las condiciones, que son factores que pueden inﬂuir en la aparici´on de un
determinado fallo. Las condiciones pueden agruparse en funcionalidades y conﬁguraciones. Las
funcionalidades son t´ecnicas que los operadores normalmente aplican para mejorar la calidad
de la red, como los saltos de frecuencia, la transmisi´on discontinua, etc. Las conﬁguraciones
son caracter´ısticas especiales de ciertas celdas que pueden tener impacto sobre las causas que
normalmente se presentan, por ejemplo, el tipo de celda (rural/urbana, interior/exterior, etc.),
el clima, etc.

Relaci´on cualitativa entre causas, s´ıntomas y condiciones
Una vez que se han explicado las principales causas, s´ıntomas y condiciones a tener en cuenta
en la GERAN, se describe la relaci´on cualitativa que existe entre estas variables. Por ejemplo,
la causa “falta de cobertura” va asociada a los s´ıntomas “calidad de se˜nal recibida” y “nivel de
se˜nal recibida”, ya que su presencia provoca una disminuci´on del valor de estos s´ıntomas.
Casos de estudio
Se presentan algunos casos de redes reales. En primer lugar, se muestran los valores de los
indicadores de funcionamiento para celdas con problemas. A continuaci´on, se describen algunos
ejemplos de celdas con problemas cuya identiﬁcaci´on es especialmente compleja, y su resoluci´on
por expertos.
E.3.2
Modelado bayesiano de la diagnosis de fallos
Introducci´on
Este cap´ıtulo se centra en la representaci´on del modelo y en el m´etodo de inferencia. En primer
lugar, se describen las variables que deben incluir todos los modelos (causas, s´ıntomas y condi-
ciones). Se explica c´omo modelar estos elementos mediante variables aleatorias, algunas conti-
nuas y otras discretas. Se resalta que una de las mayores diﬁcultades encontradas en el modelado
se debe a que los indicadores de funcionamiento son variables continuas.
Clasiﬁcador Bayesiano
El primer sistema que se propone consiste en un clasiﬁcador bayesiano, el cual aparece con
frecuencia en referencias sobre aprendizaje de m´aquinas (machine learning) [165, 74, 82]. El
clasiﬁcador bayesiano es uno de los clasiﬁcadores m´as eﬁcientes, ya que, a pesar de ser muy
simple, es competitivo con el resto de los clasiﬁcadores actuales.
Se estudia c´omo utilizar el clasiﬁcador para la diagnosis, sus limitaciones y los elementos de
los que consta el modelo. La parte cualitativa del modelo se deﬁne mediante variables aleatorias.
La parte cuantitativa queda determinada por funciones densidad de probabilidad (fdp).
Se investiga c´omo obtener las fdp en el caso de la diagnosis en la RAN, demostrando que las
fdp de los s´ıntomas dadas las causas pueden modelarse de forma bastante precisa utilizando fdp
beta. Los par´ametros de las fdp pueden obtenerse a partir de casos de entrenamiento o bien ser
proporcionados por expertos en diagnosis.
Por ´ultimo, se presenta el m´etodo para calcular las probabilidades de las causas dados los
s´ıntomas, el cual se basa en la conocida regla de Bayes.
Redes Bayesianas
Las Redes Bayesianas (RBs) [110, 157], tambi´en llamadas redes de creencia probabil´ısticas (belief
probabilistic networks), han sido propuestas por muchos autores como la t´ecnica de modelado

para el desarrollo de sistemas de diagnosis. Una RB representa gr´aﬁcamente una distribuci´on de
probabilidad conjunta sobre un conjunto de variables aleatorias. Una de las principales ventajas
de las RBs es que proporcionan una representaci´on natural y eﬁciente del razonamiento bajo
incertidumbre.
Los algoritmos de inferencia en RBs (m´etodo) permiten obtener la probabilidad de una
determinada variable dada la evidencia disponible, bas´andose en el teorema de Bayes. Existen
algoritmos eﬁcientes que realizan esta tarea cuando la RB es compleja.
El modelo consiste en nodos (variables aleatorias), enlaces dirigidos (relaciones de dependen-
cia entre variables) y distribuciones de probabilidad. Por ejemplo, la Fig.E.1 muestra una RB
muy sencilla donde se pueden observar los componentes principales de cualquier RB.
Los principales problemas encontrados durante la construcci´on del modelo han sido la deﬁnici´on
de la estructura de la RB, el modelado de los s´ıntomas continuos y la especiﬁcaci´on de las prob-
abilidades de la RB:
• Uno de los inconvenientes de las RBs es la diﬁcultad de construir modelos complejos. Por
eso, una t´ecnica usada a menudo para simpliﬁcar el modelado es asumir una estructura
de red, es decir, suponer ciertas relaciones de independencia entre las variables. De esta
forma el problema se convierte en la especiﬁcaci´on de los nodos y tablas de probabilidad
de una determinada RB. Gracias a esto, no s´olo se simpliﬁca la deﬁnici´on del modelo, sino
tambi´en los algoritmos de inferencia.
• Las RBs discretas son m´as sencillas que las continuas. Por este motivo, son las utilizadas
con mayor frecuencia en aplicaciones reales. Por tanto, en el caso bajo estudio es necesaria
una discretizaci´on de los indicadores de funcionamiento continuos.
• Una vez que las variables continuas se han discretizado, la siguiente diﬁcultad radica en
la deﬁnici´on de las tablas de probabilidad de la RB.
• Debido a la falta de bases de datos con casos para aprender los par´ametros del modelo,
con frecuencia el modelo debe basarse en el conocimiento. Esto da lugar a inevitables

E.3. MODELADO DE LA DIAGNOSIS DE FALLOS
263
imprecisiones en los par´ametros. Por eso, se han propuesto dos m´etodos para disminuir
los errores en la diagnosis debido a estas imprecisiones en los par´ametros.
Deﬁnici´on de la estructura
En primer lugar, se estudian posibles estructuras de RB adecuadas para la diagnosis en la RAN
de redes celulares. Se han elegido por su simplicidad y buenos resultados las siguientes:
• La primera estructura, llamada Modelo Simple de Bayes (Simple Bayes Model, SBM),
coincide con el clasiﬁcador bayesiano.
La diferencia es que en este caso los s´ıntomas
continuos se han modelado como variables discretas. El SBM consiste en un nodo padre,
cuyos estados son las posibles causas, y nodos hijos, que representan los s´ıntomas.
• Otros tipos de RB evaluadas en esta tesis han sido los modelos de Independencia de
Inﬂuencia Causal (Independence of Causal Inﬂuence, ICI) [97, 180, 95, 93, 102]. En este
caso cada causa se representa como un nodo distinto y las tablas de probabilidad de los
s´ıntomas se simpliﬁcan bajo suposiciones de independencia causal. Se han considerado
distintos modelos ICI, en funci´on de como las causas contribuyen de forma conjunta a los
s´ıntomas: Noisy-OR, Noisy-Max, etc.
• Finalmente se propone una estructura, que se ha llamado Modelo de Bayes Central (Central
Bayes Model, CBM). En este caso, al igual que en el SBM, existe un nodo padre cuyos
estados son las posibles causas y nodos hijos que representan los s´ıntomas. Adem´as, cada
condici´on se representa mediante un nodo padre del nodo de causas.
M´etodos para la discretizaci´on de variables continuas
En este punto se investigan m´etodos para discretizar los indicadores de funcionamiento. A la
hora de seleccionar los m´etodos se ha tenido en cuenta no s´olo la precisi´on de la clasiﬁcaci´on,
sino tambi´en la complejidad del m´etodo.
Se distingue entre m´etodos basados en la experiencia y m´etodos basados en casos de entre-
namiento. Como aportaci´on a la tesis se proponen dos m´etodos que combinan la experiencia
con la informaci´on dada por casos de entrenamiento.
Los m´etodos propuestos para la RAN son los siguientes:
• El primer m´etodo, que se basa ´unicamente en el conocimiento, es el m´as adecuado cuando
no se dispone de datos de entrenamiento. Los expertos en diagnosis deﬁnen los umbrales.
Se describen las diﬁcultades asociadas a esta tarea y c´omo superarlas.
• Entre los m´etodos presentes en la bibliograf´ıa de aprendizaje de m´aquinas, destacan los
m´etodos basados en la entrop´ıa. Se ha seleccionado un algoritmo que elige como umbral
aquel punto que minimice la entrop´ıa de la partici´on determinada por dicho umbral [80].
Este m´etodo requiere la disponibilidad de casos de entrenamiento.
MENÚ
SALIR

264
APPENDIX E. SUMMARY (SPANISH)
• A continuaci´on se propone un m´etodo que combina la experiencia con los datos para llevar
a cabo la discretizaci´on. El algoritmo es una modiﬁcaci´on del m´etodo expuesto en el punto
anterior. Se basa en dividir, para cada s´ıntoma, las causas en dos grupos: las directamente
relacionados con el s´ıntoma y las no relacionadas con el s´ıntoma. Este m´etodo, por tanto,
combina el conocimiento de expertos y la informaci´on de casos de entrenamiento.
• El ´ultimo m´etodo propuesto, que tambi´en combina el conocimiento con el aprendizaje a
partir de datos, se basa en la teor´ıa del test de hip´otesis. El umbral de cada s´ıntoma se
calcula como el punto de cruce entre la probabilidad a posteriori de las causas relacionadas
y la probabilidad a posteriori de las causas no relacionadas, dado cada uno de los s´ıntomas.
Las fdp de los s´ıntomas dadas las causas se modelan como funciones beta, cuyos par´ametros
se obtienen a partir de casos de entrenamiento.
M´etodos para la deﬁnici´on de probabilidades
En este apartado se investigan m´etodos para deﬁnir las tablas de probabilidad de la RB:
• De acuerdo con el primer m´etodo, son los expertos en diagnosis los que deﬁnen las tablas
de probabilidad.
• El segundo m´etodo, el Estimador de M´axima Probabilidad (MLE), es uno de los estimadores
m´as usados en estad´ıstica. Aproxima las probabilidades por su frecuencia relativa en los
casos de entrenamiento.
• El tercer m´etodo, llamado Estimador-m [58], asume que las probabilidades a priori siguen
distribuciones beta y, a partir de los casos de entrenamiento, calcula las probabilidades a
posteriori.
• Finalmente, se propone un m´etodo que modela las fdps de los s´ıntomas dadas las causas
como funciones beta. Entonces se calculan las probabilidades de la RB como el ´area de
las funciones betas en el intervalo correspondiente.
M´etodos para combatir la imprecisi´on en los par´ametros
A diferencia de otros campos de aplicaci´on, como la diagnosis en medicina donde existen grandes
bases de datos con casos reales [50], en diagnosis de sistemas celulares, al ser un ´area nueva,
es dif´ıcil conseguir casos de entrenamiento. Por eso, en muchas ocasiones los modelos se basan
´unicamente en el conocimiento de expertos en diagnosis en redes de acceso celulares.
Debido a las diﬁcultades para establecer los par´ametros (umbrales y probabilidades) del
modelo de diagnosis, se han desarrollado dos m´etodos que pretenden aumentar la precisi´on del
sistema cuando los par´ametros son inexactos:
• La primera t´ecnica se ha llamado Redes Bayesianas Suavizadas (Smooth Bayesian Net-
works, SBN). El objetivo es suavizar los umbrales abruptos en la discretizaci´on de los
MENÚ

E.4. EVALUACI ´ON
265
s´ıntomas continuos. Las SBN se pueden entender como RB a las que se ha a˜nadido incer-
tidumbre sobre el estado en qu´e se encuentran los s´ıntomas.
• El segundo m´etodo se ha denominado M´ultiples Intervalos Uniformes (Multiple, Uniform
Intervals, MUI). Se parte de una RB en la que los s´ıntomas han sido discretizados en
s´olo dos estados, para simpliﬁcar la deﬁnici´on de los par´ametros por parte de los expertos.
Entonces se a˜nade un tercer estado alrededor del umbral, cuya probabilidad es proporcional
al ancho del intervalo.
Adquisici´on del conocimiento
Normalmente los expertos en diagnosis no conocen las t´ecnicas expuestas en los apartados an-
teriores (RB, clasiﬁcador bayesiano, etc.). Por otra parte, los expertos en inteligencia artiﬁcial
no suelen tener conocimientos sobre comunicaciones m´oviles. Por eso, es necesario juntar ambos
´ambitos de conocimiento [163, 175, 188, 76].
El objetivo de este apartado es describir un sistema que, de forma autom´atica, construya
los modelos bayesianos a partir del conocimiento de expertos en diagnosis en RANs de sistemas
celulares.
En primer lugar se describe qu´e informaci´on debe deﬁnir el experto en diagnosis y c´omo
solicitar esa informaci´on en lenguaje natural de manera ordenada. Una vez que la informaci´on
necesaria ha sido suministrada por el experto en diagnosis, se explica c´omo construir cada uno
de los modelos bayesianos descritos en este cap´ıtulo (clasiﬁcador bayesiano, SBM discreto, CIM,
etc.). La informaci´on suministrada y la construcci´on del modelo dependen del tipo de modelo a
construir.
E.4
Evaluaci´on
La ´ultima parte de la tesis se dedica a la evaluaci´on de los modelos y m´etodos para la diagnosis
propuestos en esta tesis. Se expone tambi´en la metodolog´ıa seguida para simular casos (con el
objetivo de entrenar y probar los sistemas de diagnosis) y para analizar los modelos y t´ecnicas
desarrollados.
E.4.1
Resultados
Casos de red y simulados
Para evaluar y comparar las distintas alternativas presentadas en el Cap´ıtulo 5 se requiere un
conjunto de casos de referencia que incluyan el valor de los s´ıntomas y la causa para cada celda
problem´atica. En este punto se resalta la diﬁcultad de disponer de estos casos de referencia en
la aplicaci´on bajo estudio, al contrario que ocurre en otros campos como en medicina, donde
existen grandes bases de datos con casos clasiﬁcados.
Si bien el sistema de gesti´on de las redes celulares almacena bases de datos con estad´ısticas
sobre indicadores de funcionamiento, no se registra cu´al fue la causa de la elevada tasa de

llamadas ca´ıdas en una determinada celda.
Con el objetivo de obtener los casos de referencia requeridos se llev´o a cabo una campa˜na de
an´alisis de celdas con problemas en una red GSM/GPRS durante tres meses. En este apartado
se describen los datos obtenidos, junto con sus limitaciones.
A continuaci´on se propone un procedimiento para generar un n´umero arbitrario de casos
simulados, en base a los datos de la red real y en la aproximaci´on de las fdp como funciones
beta.
Figuras de m´erito
Se describen las ﬁguras de m´erito consideradas para evaluar los distintos sistemas: precisi´on del
diagn´ostico, error en el diagn´ostico, probabilidad de la causa correcta, n´umero de orden de la
causa seg´un su probabilidad, etc.
An´alisis de sensibilidad
Adem´as de las anteriores medidas, otro par´ametro importante para medir la calidad de un
determinado sistema de diagnosis es la sensibilidad de sus resultados a cambios en los par´ametros.
As´ı, un sistema ser´a tanto mejor cuanto menos sensibles sean sus conclusiones a una deﬁnici´on
inexacta de sus par´ametros. Se presenta aqu´ı el m´etodo emp´ırico que se utilizar´a para medir la
sensibilidad a las probabilidades [158]. Se propone tambi´en un m´etodo para medir la sensibilidad
a la imprecisi´on en los umbrales.
Metodolog´ıa
Se describe la metodolog´ıa seguida para evaluar y comparar los modelos y t´ecnicas propuestos
en la segunda parte de la tesis.
Estimaci´on de funciones de probabilidad
En esta secci´on se modelan las fdp de los s´ıntomas dadas las causas como funciones beta.
Para ello se calculan los par´ametros de las funciones beta utilizando un estimador de m´axima
verosimilitud de los casos reales obtenidos de una red GSM/GPRS. Mediante t´ecnicas es-
tad´ısticas se eval´ua la proximidad entre los datos de la red y las fdp estimadas. Si los resultados
son aceptables, se utilizan las funciones beta obtenidas para generar casos de prueba y casos de
entrenamiento.
Evaluaci´on de los sistemas de diagnosis
Los diversos sistemas de diagnosis presentados en el Cap´ıtulo 5 se eval´uan en esta secci´on.
Los experimentos se realizan tanto para casos de la red real como para casos simulados. Los
aspectos analizados para todos los sistemas de diagnosis son las ﬁguras de m´erito, la inﬂuencia
en los resultados del n´umero de casos de entrenamiento y la sensibilidad de sus resultados a
imprecisiones en los par´ametros. Adem´as para determinados m´etodos, como los algoritmos de

para la discretizaci´on de variables continuas como para el c´alculo de probabilidades de la
RB.
• Prevenci´on de imprecisiones en los par´ametros del modelo.

En esta secci´on se resumen algunos resultados obtenidos a ra´ız de la colaboraci´on con Nokia.
En primer lugar se presenta un prototipo de herramienta para la adquisici´on del conocimiento
basada en los procedimientos descritos en el Cap´ıtulo 5. Dicho sistema se proporcion´o a diversos
operadores de redes de comunicaciones m´oviles para que construyesen un modelo de diagnosis
para la red de acceso. Se explican las principales diﬁcultades encontradas y c´omo se intentaron
superar.
A continuaci´on, se presenta un prototipo de herramienta autom´atica de diagnosis.
Finalmente, se describen resultados obtenidos al usar dicha herramienta de diagnosis en una
campa˜na de pruebas en una red GSM/GPRS real. El modelo utilizado se basa en el conocimiento
de expertos y fue construido con ayuda del sistema de adquisici´on del conocimiento.
