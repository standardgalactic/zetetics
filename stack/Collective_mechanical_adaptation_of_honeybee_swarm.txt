Honeybee Apis mellifera swarms form clusters made solely of bees attached to
each other, forming pendant structures on tree branches (1). These clusters
can be hundreds of times the size of a single organism. How these structures
are stably maintained under the inﬂuence of static gravity and dynamic stimuli
(e.g. wind) is unknown. To address this, we created pendant conical clusters
attached to a board that was shaken with varying amplitude, frequency and to-
tal duration. Our observations show that horizontally shaken clusters spread
out to form wider, ﬂatter cones, i.e. the cluster adapts to the dynamic loading
conditions, but in a reversible manner - when the loading is removed, the clus-
ter recovers its original shape, slowly. Measuring the response of a cluster to a
sharp pendular excitation before and after it adapted shows that the ﬂattened
cones deform less and relax faster than the elongated ones, i.e. they are more
stable mechanically. We use particle-based simulations of a passive assem-
blage to suggest a behavioral hypothesis that individual bees respond to local
variations in strain. This behavioral response improves the collective stability
of the cluster as a whole at the expense of increasing the average mechanical
burden experienced by the individual. Simulations using this rule explain our
observations of adaptation to horizontal shaking. The simulations also suggest
that vertical shaking will not lead to signiﬁcant differential strains and thus no
adaptation. To test this, we shake the cluster vertically and ﬁnd that indeed
there is no response to this stimulus. Altogether, our results show how an ac-
tive, functional super–organism structure can respond adaptively to dynamic
mechanical loading by changing its morphology to achieve better load sharing.

Figure 1: A mechanically adaptive honeybee cluster. A) Bee clusters on a tree branch. B) Experimental setup
consists of a motor driving a wooden board, on which a cluster of bees grips a roughly circular contact area. The
motor can produce periodic movement in the horizontal or vertical axis at different frequencies and amplitudes. See
Fig. S1 for full setup. C) The top panel shows the acceleration of the board vs. time. The middle and bottom panels
show how the bee cluster adapts its shape dynamically: Elongated cluster at t=0 (left column), spread-out cluster
after horizontal shaking for 10 minutes and 30 minutes (middle columns), and elongated cluster after relaxation
(right column); side and bottom views. The contact area before and after shaking is highlighted in blue and red,
respectively.
Collective dynamics allow super–organisms to function in ways that a single organism
cannot, by virtue of their emergent size, shape, physiology and behavior (2). Classic examples
include the physiological and behavioral strategies seen in social insects, e.g. ants that link their
bodies to form rafts to survive ﬂoods (3–6), assemble pulling chains to move food items (8),
form bivouac (7), as well as bridges and ladders to traverse rough terrain (9). Similarly, huddling
groups of “daddy longlegs”, emperor penguins cluster together for thermoregulation purposes
(10), etc. While much is known about the static forms which are seen in such situations, the
stability of these forms to dynamic perturbation, and their global response in the context of
adaptation is much less understood.

European honeybees, Apis mellifera, show many of these collective behaviors during
their life cycle (1). For example, during the reproductive cycle of bees: colonies reproduce
through colony ﬁssion, a process in which a subset of the colony’s workers and a queen leave
the hive, separate from the parent colony, and form a cluster on a nearby tree branch (1). In
these swarm clusters (which we will refer to as clusters), the bees adhere to each other and
form a large structure made of ⇠10, 000 individuals and can be hundreds of times the size of
a single organism (Fig. 1A). Generally, this hanging mass of adhered bees takes on the shape
of an inverted pendant cone, however, the resultant shape is also inﬂuenced by the surface to
which the cluster is clinging to (see two different examples in Fig. 1A). The cluster can stay in
place for several days as scout bees search the surrounding area for suitable nest sites (1).
The colony is never more exposed to the environment than during this stage and these
clusters show several striking behaviors to cope with the ﬂuctuating thermal and mechanical
environment.
For instance, clusters tune their density and surface area to volume ratio to
maintain a near constant core temperature despite large ﬂuctuations in the ambient tempera-
ture (11–13). Furthermore, at high temperatures, the swarm expands and forms channels which
are presumed to aid in air circulation (14). Additionally, in response to rain, bees at the surface
arrange themselves to form “shingles”, shedding moisture efﬁciently from the surface of the
cluster (15). Similarly, the cluster is mechanically stable; while it sways from side to side in
the wind (e.g. see Movie S1), it could be catastrophic if the cluster breaks (when a critical load
appears) as the bees would lose the ability to minimize surface area to prevent hypothermia,
while still being mechanically stable. However, the mechanism by which a multitude of bees
work together to create and maintain a stable structure that handles both static gravity and dy-
namic shaking stimuli (e.g. wind, predators), remains elusive. To understand this, we develop
an experimental setup to quantify the response of a honeybee cluster to mechanical shaking
over short and long times.
To prepare a cluster, we attach a caged queen (see SI Sec. A) to a board and allowed
a cluster to form around her (Fig. 1B). The bees at the base grip onto an area that is roughly
circular. The board is controlled by a motor that can produce movement in the horizontal
direction at different frequencies (0.5Hz – 5Hz) and accelerations (ranged 0 −0.1g). We apply
both discontinuous shaking in which the acceleration is kept constant and the frequency is
modiﬁed, and vice versa, continuous shaking in which the frequency is kept constant and the
acceleration is modiﬁed (see Fig. S2).
For the case of horizontal shaking (for both discontinuous and continuous), the tall conical
cluster swings to and fro in a pendular mode (one of the lowest energy modes of motion, see
SI Sec. C), with a typical frequency of ⇠1Hz. However, over longer durations (i.e. minutes),
the bees adapt by spreading themselves into a ﬂatter conical form (Fig. 1B,C,D, Movie S2),
while their total number remain constant (measured by the total weight of the cluster). The ﬁnal
shape ﬂattens as the shaking continues for longer, or as frequency and acceleration of shaking

increases. For the discontinuous shaking, when we plot the relative extent of spreading (scaled
by a constant) as measured by A(t)/A(0) for all different frequencies, as a function of number of
shakes, the data collapses onto a single curve (Fig. 2A). This suggests that the cluster response
scales with both the number and magnitude of shakes, but over much longer time scales than an
individual event. The nature of this response is independent of the type of stimulus: when the
shaking signal is continuous, we see a similar response (Fig. 2B). The graded adaptive response
that scales with the number of shakes and is a function of applied displacements and frequencies,
and the absence of any adaptation to very low frequencies and amplitudes (orange curves in
Fig. 2B) suggests that there is a critical relative displacement (i.e. a threshold mechanical strain)
needed to trigger this adaptation. Once the shaking stops, the cluster returns to its original
elongated cone conﬁguration over a period of 30 −120 minutes, a time that is much larger than
the time for the cluster to ﬂatten. This reversible cluster shape change to dynamic loading might
be a functional adaptation that increases the mechanical stability of a ﬂattened cluster relative
to an elongated one.
To explore this suggestion quantitatively, we ﬁrst deﬁne a lab-ﬁxed coordinate system
with axes as shown in Fig. 2C, with respect to which the board is at −−!
rb(t) = [Ub, 0, Wb], the
position of a bee i is deﬁned as −−!
ri(t) = [Xi(t), Yi(t), Zi(t)] , and its displacement is deﬁned as
[Ui(t), 0, Wi(t)] = −−!
ri(t) −−−!
ri(0) −−−!
rb(t) . This allows us to track individual bees (18) along
the surface of the cluster along the centerline Xi(0) = 0 (Fig. 2D, Movie S3), over a period of
oscillation. Comparing trajectories of bees in an elongated cluster and a ﬂat cluster, i.e. before
and after shaking, show that relative displacement between the bees at the cluster tip and bees
at the base is signiﬁcantly larger for an elongated cluster. Snapshots of tracked bees highlight
the decoupling of movement of the tip and base of the cluster, i.e. local deformations such
as normal and shear strains are reduced in the mechanically adapted state corresponding to a
spread cluster. A similar trend is observed when the cluster is subjected to a single sharp shake
(see signal at Fig. S2C), as shown in Movie S4. These measurements conﬁrm that the adapted
ﬂattened structure is indeed more mechanically stable in the presence of dynamic horizontal
loads.
Spreading of the cluster is a collective process, begging the question of how this collective
spreading behavior is achieved. To study this, we tracked bees on the surface of the cluster
during the process of adaptive spreading, particularly at the early stages. In Fig. 2E, Movie S5
we show how bees move from the tip-regions that are subject to large relative displacements
towards the base-regions that are subject to small relative displacements, suggesting that the
relative displacement Ui, may be a driver of shape adaptation.
But what measure of the relative displacements might the bees be responding to? To
understand this, we note that the fundamental modes of a pendant elastic cone are similar to
those of a pendulum swinging from side to side, and a spring bouncing up and down, and their
frequencies monotonically increase as a function of the aspect ratio of the cluster (Fig. S3) (see

SI Sec. C for details). To quantify the deviations from this simple picture due to the particulate
nature of the assemblage, we turn to a computational model of the passive dynamics of a cluster
and explore the role of shape on a pendant mechanical assemblage of passive particles used to
mimic bees. We model each bee in the cluster as a spherical particle which experiences three
forces: a gravitational force, an attractive force between neighboring particles, and a force that
prevents inter-particle penetration (see SI Sec. C for further details). The bees at the base are
assumed to be strongly attached to the supporting board, and those on the surface are assumed
to be free. To study the passive response of the entire system, the board is oscillated at dif-
ferent frequencies and amplitudes, while we follow the displacement of individual particles,

(Fig. 3A). Decomposing the vector −−!
lij(t) into its magnitude and direction allows us to deﬁne
two local deformation measures associated with the local normal strain and shear strain. The
local dynamic normal strain associated with a particle (bee) i relative to its extension at t = 0

As expected, we see that for the same forcing, the maximum amplitude of the local strains
increases as the cluster becomes more elongated (Fig. 3A,B, Movie S6). Therefore, these local
strains can serve as a signal for the bees to move, and a natural hypothesis is that once the
signal is above a certain critical value, the bees move. But how might they chose a direction
? While it may be plausible for the bees to simply move upwards against gravity, it is likely
difﬁcult to sense a static force (i.e., gravity) when experiencing large dynamic forcing (i.e.,
shaking) in a tightly packed assemblage. Instead, we turn to ask whether there are any local
signals that would give honeybees a sense of direction. For all clusters, the strains are largest
near the base (Fig. 3A,B, Movie S6) and decrease away from it, but in addition, as the cluster
becomes more elongated, there are large local strains along the contact line where x = ±L1/2
where the bees are in contact with the baseboard. This is due to the effect of the pendular
mode of deformation that leads to rotation-induced stretching in these regions. To quantify how
the normal and shear strain vary as a function of the distance from the base, Z, we average
δli and δ✓i over all bees that were at a certain Z position at t = 0 and deﬁne the following
mean quantities: δl(Z) = hδlii, and δ✓(Z) = hδ✓ii, where the bracket <> indicate average
over all spring connection at the vertical position ri
z(0) = Z. Similar to the experimental data,
the simulations show that the displacements Ui for horizontal shaking of elongated clusters are
larger in comparison to ﬂattened clusters. As both strains δl(Z) and δ✓(Z) are largest near the
base, z = 0 (Fig. 3C, Movie S6), and decrease away from the supporting baseboard, they may

serve as local signals that bees at the tip of the cluster respond to by moving up the strain-
gradient (Fig. S3–5, Movie S7–8).
This passive signature of a horizontally-shaken assemblage suggests a simple behavioral
hypothesis: bees can sense the local variations in the normal strain above a critical threshold,
and move slowly up gradients collectively. We note that mechanical strain is invariant to trans-
lation and rotation of the whole assemblage, i.e. it is independent of the origin and orientation of
the frame of reference, and thus a natural choice. This behavior will naturally lead to spreading
of the cluster and thence smaller strains on the cluster. Noting that time scale of the response of
the bees is of the order of minutes while the duration of a single period is seconds, it is natural to
consider the integrated local normal strain signal: f
δlt
i = Pt
˜t=t−Tw δl˜t
i ⇥dt, where Tw is chosen
to be the period of the shaking (see detailed description in the SI Sec. C). Then our behavioral
hypothesis is that when f
δlt
i > f
δlt
iC the bee becomes active, and moves in the direction of the
time-integrated negative normal strain gradient (i.e. the active force is directed toward a higher
local normal strain) according to the simple proportional rule F active = −f active−!
f
δlt
i. We note that
moving up a gradient in time-integrated shear strain would also sufﬁce to explain the observed
mechanical adaptation.
We carry out our simulations of the active cluster in two dimensions for simplicity and
speed (we do not expect any changes in 3D), allowing bonds to break and reform based on
proximity similar to how bees form connections, and follow the shape of the cluster while it
is shaken horizontally. We ﬁnd that over time, the cluster spreads out to form a ﬂattened cone
(Fig. 3D,E, Movie S7), conﬁrming that the local behavioral rule that integrates relative displace-
ments that arise due to long-range passive coupling in the mechanical assemblage wherein bees
actively move up the local gradient in normal strain δli does explain our observations.
If sufﬁciently large dynamic normal strain gradients drive shape adaptation, different
shaking protocols that result in lower local strains should limit adaptation. One way is to shake
the cluster gently, and this indeed does not drive adaptation (Fig. 2B responding to 0.01g).
Another is to shake the cluster in a vertical direction, exciting the spring-like mode of the as-
semblage. For the same range of amplitudes and frequencies as used for horizontal shaking, our
simulations of a passive assemblage show that vertical shaking results results in particles being
collectively displaced up and down, with little normal strain. As expected, even in active clus-
ters with the behavioral rule implemented, little or no adaptation occurs as the threshold normal
strain gradient is not achieved (Fig. S5–6 and Movie S8). To test this experimentally, we shake
the cluster vertically. We see that in this case the cluster shape remains approximately constant
(Fig. 4A,B) until a critical acceleration is reached - at which time a propagating crack results
in the detachment of the cluster from the board (Movie S9). Quantifying the displacements at
the tip for vertical shaking and horizontal shaking are in agreement with our hypothesis that
differential normal strain gradients drive adaptation (Fig. 4C, Movie S10).

Our study has shown how dynamic loading of honeybee swarm clusters leads to mechan-
ical adaptation wherein the cluster spreads out in response to repeated shaking. We show that
this morphological response increases the mechanical stability of the cluster. A computational
model of the bee cluster treated as a passive mechanical assemblage suggests that there are
strain gradients that can be used by bees as a local signal to drive movement in the direction of
higher strains and causing the cluster to ﬂatten. This behavioral response improves the collec-
tive stability of the cluster as a whole via a reversible shape change, at the expense of increasing
the average mechanical burden experienced by the individual. Introducing elastic interactions
between the bees naturally allows for long-range signaling via physical cues, complementing
the more traditional view of collective behavior via stigmergy (16) wherein organisms respond
to local chemical cues with little or no long range effects. Given the tensorial non-local nature
of elastic interactions in assemblages of social insects, perhaps this is just the tip of an iceberg
that hides the many ways in which organisms take advantage of physical interactions and simple
behavioral rules to adapt to changing mechanical environments.

Figure 2: Quantifying adaptive response of the cluster: For all shaking frequencies, the base contact area
of the cluster increases monotonically until a plateau is reached. Once shaking ceases, the cluster responds by
gradually reverting to its original shape by increasing its contact area, but at a much slower rate. A) Ratio of
the contact area of the base of the cluster divided by its original area A(t)/A(0) as a function of time, for the
discontinuous case. Colors represent results for different frequencies of periodic shaking. Inset shows that the
scaled base area collapses onto a master curve when plotted vs. number of shaking events. Error bars correspond
to standard deviation of three individual trials. B) A(t)/A(0) for continuous shaking shows the same qualitative
behavior; note that when the acceleration is very small (0.01g), there is no response, i.e. there is a critical threshold
of forcing below which the bees do not respond. C) Coordinate systems of the lab-frame and the displacement
coordinates of the individual bees. D) Deformation of an elongated cluster before shaking began (t = 0, top) and
a ﬂattened cluster after shaking (t = 30 [sec], bottom) shows that displacement at the tip of the cluster is largest.
On the right: time snapshots of a string of bees along the center of the cluster (See Movie S3). E) Trajectories
of individual bees during 5 minutes of horizontal shaking show that when the cluster spreads out, surface bees
move upwards. Color code represents time: the trajectory starts with blue and ends with yellow. Inset: probability
distribution function of vertical displacement, showing a net upward trend.

of a period of horizontal oscillation. Colors represent the local normal strain of each honeybee δli, as deﬁned in
the text. Elongated clusters (on the right) experience a larger deformation at the tip of the cluster, while ﬂattened
clusters (on the left) experience much less deformation. B) For the same state as in A), we also show the maximum
shear strain, δ✓i. C) Plots of the mean normal and shear strain (δl(Z) and δ✓(Z)) as a function of the distance from
the base, Z, and aspect ratio Lz/Lx. We see that the maximum magnitude of the strains decreases as the cluster
becomes ﬂattened. D) When we impose a behavioral rule that allows the bees to sense the strains around them and
move in the direction of increasing strain when the magnitude crosses a threshold (f

leads to a very small displacement. This is consistent with our simulations (see Fig. S4, SI Sec. D) that vertical
shakes do not destabilize the bees differentially. B) Contact area of the base of the cluster relative to its initial
area A(t)/A(0) vs. time. Areas are deﬁned as in Fig. 1D. Colors represent results for different accelerations of
continuous shaking. C) Maximum displacement at the tip of a tall cluster as a result of a single horizontal and
vertical shake. Bees do not respond or change the shape of the cluster when subjected to vertical shaking (green),
but do respond substantially when shaken horizontally (blue). Black dotted line represents the experimentally
