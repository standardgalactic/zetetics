The One-Dimensional Ising Model 
1. I N T R O D U C T I O N 
There is an enormous difference between the one-dimensional and 
two-dimensional Ising models. In one dimension an Ising model with 
nearest-neighbor forces does not possess a phase transition, whereas in 
two dimensions it does. The primary goal of this book is to study the 
phase transition in two dimensions as explicitly as possible. However, that 
study is long and is complicated by the fact that for many quantities of 
interest closed-form answers are not available and we must be content 
with appropriate approximations. Therefore, before commencing the 
study of the two-dimensional Ising model it is useful to study the one-
dimensional model where both the free energy and the spin-spin correla-
tion function may be exactly computed in closed form in the presence of 
a magnetic field.1 
In a one-dimensional lattice with Jf spins we consider the interaction 
energy given by (1.2.4) with j = 1 and 1 < k < J f . However, to complete 
the specification of the system we need to state precisely what are the 
interactions of the spins 1 and Jf at the two ends. There are two common 
ways of treating these end spins. 
(1) Cyclic. 
We consider the one-dimensional lattice deformed into a 
circle and join site 1 and site Jf by a bond of strength Εγ. Then the 
interaction energy is 
¿c = —-El 2 
akak + l — Η 2 
"k, 
k = 1 
k = l 
where 
= ay.

We may also consider the more natural arrangement in 
which spin 1 interacts only with H and with spin 2 and spin Jf interacts 
only with H and with spin Jf — 1. Then the interaction energy is

We will treat both types of boundary conditions in this chapter not 
only to show that they both have the same free energy (per site) in the 
limit Jf 
oo but also to see for systems of finite size how large Jf must 
be before the boundary conditions may safely be ignored. 
Though the distinction between these two types of boundary conditions 
is in general clear, the case Jf — 2 is slightly peculiar, since if E1 is the 
bond between the two spins with the free end conditions we may obtain 
all properties of the cyclic case merely by replacing Ex by 2E1. In par-
ticular, for free boundary conditions there are only four possible states 
of the system and it is elementary to find

We will explicitly compute these partition functions for arbitrary J f by 
use of a matrix formalism introduced by Kramers and Wannier.2 
Consider the spins ak and a k + 1 together. If ak = ak+1, these spins give a 
contribution —E^ to the interaction energy, whereas if ok = — a k + u they 
give a contribution of +Ey. Furthermore, with this pair of spins we as-
sociate the energy 
+ ak+1). Let the two values which any a may 
take on be the basis of a two-dimensional vector space and in this space 
define the matrix Ρ by 
<σ|Ρ|σ'> = exp {βΙΕ,σσ' + \Η{σ + σ')]}, 
(2.3) 
the vector V by 
<σ| Vy = e6H"12,

THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL ISING

To evaluate (2.7) and (2.8) we remark that since Ρ is a symmetric 
matrix it may be diagonalized by a similarity transformation with some 
matrix U. Therefore define U and λ± by

= eBEi [cosh βΗ ± (sinh2 β Η + e~ WEi)lí2].

THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
and 
Z ï > = 2[2 cosh ß E ^ - K 
(2.16) 
These expressions have two interesting features which will reappear in 
our discussion of the two-dimensional model. First of all, we note that 
is an even function of Eu whereas ZC
1¡A- is an even function of Ex if 
Jf is even but possesses no such symmetry if Jf is odd. These features 
may be readily understood by considering the interaction energies $¥ and 
Sc of (1.1) and (1.2) with H = 0. If in (1.2) we make the replacement 
(2.17) 
then 
+ 
-EJ. 
(2.18) 
Since 
is a summation of e~Mr(,7;Ei> over all states, (2.18) guarantees 
that Z l t j r will be an even function of E^ Consider next S„ given by (1.1). 
If we make the substitution (2.17) we see that 
*lo\ Ex) = *¿o>; -EJ 
+ [1 - (-ΐησ,σ^. 
(2.19) 
If Jf is even, 1 — (— 1)-^ vanishes and (2.19) guarantees that Z{,jr will be 
an even function of Ex. 
The second feature of (2.15) and (2.16) to be noted is their Τ-*• 0 limit. 
As T-*-0, 
-*• 2eBlEilur~1\ 
(2.20) 
This limit is in accord with the right-hand side of (1.13) since 
= 
(2-21) 
and the degeneracy of this state is 2. However, the Γ-> 0 limit of ZJ,^ is 
slightly more complicated. If Ελ > 0 or if 
< 0 and JV is even, then 
(2.22) 
When 
< 0 and J f is odd, then 
2jVeB[E^ur~ 2'. 
(2.23) 
The difference between these two cases is related to the behavior of Sc 
under the substitution (2.17) which is shown in (2.19). It can perhaps be 
best seen in Fig. 3.1. When Ex < 0 and Jf is even, 
has the two ground 
states shown there. However, when E1 < 0 and Jf is odd, the regular 
alternation of spins in the ground state which is possible when Jf is even 
must be broken at one bond. At this bond the two neighboring spins must 
both point either up or down. Since the mismatched bond can be any of 
the Jf bonds in the ring, the degeneracy of this ground state is U f . The 
bond at which the mismatch occurs is called the " antiferromagnetic

will return to this seam in Chapter V where we will see that in a two-
dimensional Ising model a comparable phenomenon exists not only for 
Τ — 0 but for all Τ below the critical temperature. 
From (2.10) it is clear that when Η is real and β is finite and positive 
λ+ > λ_. 
(2.24) 
Therefore if Τ > 0,

(2.25) 
so that, as expected in the thermodynamic limit, the free energy per spin 
with cyclic boundary conditions and the free energy per spin with free 
boundary conditions are the same. 
The approach of jV'1 
In Z1¡t/y to this 
-> oo limit depends strongly 
on the boundary conditions. From (2.13) we find that for large JT

(2.27) 
Therefore 
approaches F exponentially in Jf 
while 
1 In Zi_jr approaches F at the much slower rate of 
Jf~1. 
We may interpret this difference as follows. First note that the second 
term in (2.27) is proportional to the number of free spins at the ends of the 
lattice. Because this term is lacking in (2.26) we identify — 
times 
the second term in (2.27) as an additional free energy of a free end. 

[38] 
THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
We therefore expect that, as long as a sample is large enough that its 
"surface"-to-"volume" ratio may be neglected, boundary conditions be-
come unimportant for the computation of physical properties derivable 
from the free energy. 
We may now use the formalism of the last chapter to find from the 
free energy

For comparison with later work we plot M(H) versus Η for EJk — 1

fixed Η for Ei/k = — 1 in Fig. 3.4, and c versus Τ in Fig. 3.5. 
It is clear from the definition that if J f is finite both 
and Z{_jr are 
analytic functions of β and Η for all β and H. However, we see explicitly 
from (2.27) that in the limit J f -*• oo there are values of β and Η where

neither F nor e~eF is analytic. This lack of analyticity, however, does not 
occur for H real and β positive so there is no possibility of a phase transi-
tion in this one-dimensional system. In particular, for all Τ > 0 this 
system cannot be ferromagnetic because limH^0 M(H) is zero.

The existence of this limiting value is independent of the sign of Ex. 
However, it is easily seen from (2.10) that the approach to this limit is 
monotonie if E1 > 0. If Ex < 0 the approach is oscillatory. In general the 
value of <σΝ.σΝ}° for Ex < 0 is not simply expressible in terms of <σλ.,σΛ.)° 
with Ex replaced by — Ex. However, in the special case Η = 0 we easily 
see that 
<σ.ν-σ,ν>' = (tanh 
(3.8) 
Therefore 
< < ^ > c k 
= ( - l y - * W » > 1 - E l . 
(3.9) 
This is precisely the relation expected from the behavior (2.18) of 
under the substitution (2.17). 
In (5.41) of the previous chapter we defined the long-range order as the 
limit when Ν — Ν' - > oo of (σΝ·σΝ} 
evaluated at Η = 0. From (3.8) we 
see that the long-range order so defined is 1 if Τ = 0 and zero otherwise. 
This absence of long-range order at Τ > 0 has a simple explanation. From 
(3.9) we may restrict our considerations to Ex > 0. When Τ = 0 the 
system must be in its lowest energy state and all spins point in the same 
direction. Therefore <σ0σν) = 1. However, if we let Τ > 0 then not only 
is the lowest energy state important for the computation of <σ0σν> but 
so are the low-lying excited states. But, because of the one-dimensional 
nature of this system, if we overturn one spin to put the system in its first 
excited state we may then overturn one of its nearest neighbors with no 
additional cost in energy. Indeed, the first excited state is 
— 1)-

fold degenerate. The states contributing to this degenerate level consist of 
all ways that the one-dimensional chain may be broken up into two blocks 
of spins with the spins in one block all pointing up and the spins in the 
other all pointing down. Because of this large degeneracy this first excited 
state has none of the order possessed by the 2-fold degenerate ground 
state and hence, for Τ > 0, <σ0σΝ) must be zero. 
The case of free boundary conditions is treated in a similar fashion. By

THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL ISING 
MODEL 
This correlation function is an enormous mess when compared with 
the much simpler expression (3.4) obtained for the lattice with cyclic 
boundary conditions. In fact, it is to avoid such complicated expressions 
that cyclic boundary conditions are often imposed in statistical mechani-
cal problems. However, there are several features of this result which will 
reappear in our later work on boundary effects in the two-dimensional 
lattice. In particular, we note that (3.12) does not depend on Ν — Ν' 
alone but on Ν and N' separately. Therefore there are several ways to 
take the thermodynamic limit. One possible way is to keep Ν and N' 
fixed and let Jf -> oo. In this limit we are observing the correlation of 
two spins each of which is a finite distance from the free boundary. 
From (3.12) we explicitly obtain 
= (sinh2 ßH + e-w^-Hsinh 2 β Η + e"« Ei (λ_/λ+)"-Β' 
- 4sinh 2£#e-« £i sinh2
 J8£'1[(A_/À+)W'-1 - (λ_/λ+)""1]}. 
(3.13) 
However, we may also consider the limit where not only does Jf 
oo 
but also N-> oo, N' 
oo, Jf — ΛΓ-> oo, and Jf — N' 
oo. We refer 
to this limit as the bulk limit, because the two spins to be correlated are 
infinitely far from the boundary, and find 
lim <σΝ.σΝ)" = (sinh2 ßH + e-^VpHsinh 2 ßH + 
(3.14) 
bulk 
This limit may be obtained from (3.13) by letting Ν 
oo and N' -> oo 
while keeping Ν — Ν' fixed. It also is identical with the expression (3.5) 
for <oN-oNy. We therefore are led to expect that if we are interested only 
in bulk properties of the Ising model it is immaterial what boundary 
conditions we apply. In later chapters we will study the two-dimensional 
Ising model under several different boundary conditions and explicitly 
verify this conclusion. 
If bulk properties of any statistical mechanical model in the thermo-
dynamic limit do depend on the boundary conditions, then the distinction 
between bulk and surface can no longer be sharply made. While we will 
not be concerned with such problems in this book, it should be remarked 
that such difficulties can arise if the forces between particles approach 
zero sufficiently slowly as the separation between spins becomes infinite. 
In such cases a discussion of macroscopic properties in terms of a free 
energy such as that defined by (II.5.5) is inadequate.
