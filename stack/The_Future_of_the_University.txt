I am not a prophet, nor can I look into the future – not even at the end of this
productive conference on essential changes in the higher education system. When
the work situation of the academic profession, its diversiﬁcation and academic
freedom are at issue, the university as a whole is called into question, at least the
university as we have known and appreciated it for a long time. Will that university
have a future? This is not clear at all, especially when we consider the managerial
university and the ever increasing marketisation of all aspects of university life. In
the following, I present a few remarks about the continuously fading theory of the
university, centred on the keywords education, university, universality, and quality.
Education
The university is changing because its social and institutional environment is
changing, and because science itself is changing. This development is often
shaped by political and economical constraints, external factors forcing internal
reorganisation. Wherever scientiﬁc reason prevails in this situation and these
external constraints are faced with institutional imagination, things work out ﬁne.
Wherever it remains idle and political and economic constraints take the upper
hand, the university is threatened with the loss of its essential nature, which
consists of an autonomous organisation for research and teaching, together with,
and joined by, a concept of education that both reﬂects and gives a critical self-
consciousness to the modern world, which is essentially scientiﬁc in nature.
In this world, the pressure to change constantly and to specialise our know-
how is steadily increasing. This drive towards specialisation stands in peculiar
contrast to the simultaneous ‘technological’ integration of knowledge. This
integration, which is effected by modern information and communication tech-
nologies, does not, however, lead to a new (or old) unity of the universally

oriented (and thus universally orienting) polymath, but rather to the creation of
the expert. The modern world is a world of experts: it is not ruled by a Leibnizian
understanding (i.e. one that mirrors the world), but by the specialist, who reﬂects
nothing or – to paraphrase the German poet Friedrich Schiller – a divided world
at best. The specialist, who knows more and more about less and less, has landed
on the other side of universality: he seeks it in details, which to him mean totality.
But this will hardly do. In a world of experts, the old ideal of uniﬁed
knowledge, even if the latter is still to be pursued ‘technologically’, loses its
social function. The distinction between ‘universal’ and ‘disciplinary’ knowl-
edge, i.e. between the responsibility for the whole and the part, begins to fade,
and this is true most of all when the knowledge society begins to see itself as an
information society. That is why the present reincarnation of the knowledge
society as an information society threatens to disappointment us, at least to the
degree that these terms denote an informed rather than an oriented society. How
such an oriented knowledge can be achieved – and by this I mean knowledge that
is not to be confused with mere expert knowledge – is thus not a question that
can be answered by an appeal to yet more information. It is actually a paradox:
the richer our stores of information and knowledge, the poorer our ability to
orient ourselves. But this ability is precisely what education once stood for.
Education is the expression of a culture in which the rational nature of Man is
realised, and simultaneously, it us the obverse of culture (which has become an
individual form of life). Wilhelm von Humboldt is still in the right. For him, an
educated person is someone who tries ‘to grasp as much of the world as is possible,
and who tries to bind it to him as tightly as possible’.1 The locus of orientation is the
life-world, not the conceptual or theoretical world. And this holds true of education
as well. Education and orientation are structurally correlated, not so much in the form
of science as in the form of life; that is to say, in the form of an ability. Following
Humboldt, we might say that it is the ability to integrate the world in oneself and to
express the world in itself: knowledge is the universal expressed as a particular, at
least if one considers knowledge and experience and deals with them sensibly.
What I have just formulated in rareﬁed and abstract – i.e. in what is commonly
called educated – language, in my opinion describes quite exactly the sense in
which a humanist educational ideal might be reintroduced into our culture, and
also our university culture. It is concerned with an active conceptualisation of the
world, and is opposed to an essentially economic preference of the Zeitgeist for a
divided self; that is to say, a self split into a private, a social and a consumer self.
As such, the conceptualisation is concerned with the restoration of an undivided
self, and with restoring clarity to the concept of knowledge by means of which
our society deﬁnes itself. And this is also something the university, caught in
the Bologna process and lured into managerial and economic ideologies, has to
learn again.

University
Every institution, every system that takes its fate into its own hands and does not
just think in terms of external dependencies, must think in terms of a planned
development, starting from an assessment of its current situation and the course it
wants to follow. Keeping in mind the observations on education made above, this
particularly applies to universities. The modern keywords are proﬁle-building
and new university structures.
Of course, a university is a type of institution where not everything can be
planned for, because the same holds true for science, the institutional heart of the
university. From this it is often inferred that planning is antagonistic to science
and universities, and that it attempts to obstruct or revoke the essence of aca-
demic freedom, the freedom of research and teaching – in other words, that
planning is part of the vocabulary of constraints. But this belief is erroneous.
Science, research and teaching should not situate themselves beyond the reach of
clear ideas of aspired and desired developments. Otherwise, they would put their
trust in natural development, rather than in a rationally justiﬁed or justiﬁable
development.
Therefore, it is important to awaken an institutional consciousness in the
universities that does not think in, and so protects, categories of what already
exists (i.e. for individual utility), but in the categories of a development in which
the tried and tested concepts of old are combined with the desirable new in order
to form functional structures of organisation that foster such a thinking. It will be
essential to practice autonomy not just towards the external, as political auton-
omy, but also internally, as structural autonomy. Structural autonomy shows
itself primarily in the realisation of structures informed by thinking about the
systematic nature of science, e.g. at the level of the organisation of subjects and
disciplines, the establishment and abolition of degrees and areas of specialisation
in research, but also in the implementation of quality standards following
international standards in research, teaching, and the education of junior aca-
demic staff. Where this is not feasible or not desired, autonomy, in the form of an
isolating strategy with respect to interference of any sort, will lead to structural
immobility and ultimately to the university bidding farewell to general devel-
opment. For example, we all know that science and research are increasingly
becoming trans-disciplinary, reaching beyond individual subjects and the core
areas of single disciplines, and the institutional structure has to take this into
account. This means that a system of science – the one that is given or can be
realised at any university – has to follow the developments of research and science
and has to create the adequate institutional background for this – in any case, the
development of research or science should not be stiﬂed by simply adhering to the
existing system. Many universities still have to learn that. To become a managerial
The Future of the University
S183

university (or to introduce any system as a result of university politics without due
reﬂection) is of secondary importance.
One thing seems sure. The present situation replicates that of the late Middle
Ages, when, for example, Oxford, Paris, and Padua were competing with each
other, and not, locally, Oxford with Glasgow, Paris with Avignon, and Padua with
Ferrara. While this competition did exist, mostly in individual disciplines, science
and education as a whole was deﬁned on the European level. As far as top research
and education are concerned, in the foreseeable future between 20 to 30 universities
will come to deﬁne the top level in Europe. Therefore, every university and national
higher education policy should now be concerned with what its future role might or
should be. Whoever fails to take the necessary steps now will miss the boat,
provided that there is a willingness to move into this direction at all.
In any case, certainly not all universities will be in the position to do this. Just
as one cannot simply decide to become a research university, let alone an elite
university, from one day to the next, even when sufﬁcient funding is available,
one cannot simply decide to play in the same league with the best European
universities in the foreseeable future. A certain size and the corresponding variety
of disciplines and levels of achievement in combination with as a strong scientiﬁc
environment yielding desirable synergies are just some of the institutional pre-
conditions required for this. This does not entail, in turn, that universities that do
not dispose of such an environment do not have a future. After all, universities
are not simply founded for scientiﬁc reasons, but equally, if not primarily, for
more general reasons of higher education and regional politics. In this respect,
they meet a speciﬁc need, i.e. the need for higher education, which often is not so
much deﬁned in terms of any scientiﬁc need as in terms of the needs of a particular
state or region. Although this does not lower the scientiﬁc requirements, formulated
on the principle of the unity of teaching and research in the Humboldtian university,
it does not put universities under pressure to be or become something which, under
the given circumstances, is out of reach for them.
But even in such a case, one thing is clear: every university is well-advised to
create its own proﬁle and to build up its strengths accordingly. It has to show
what it stands for in science and higher education, and what it may or may not
accomplish with the means at its disposal. This will almost inevitably lead to a
differentiated university system in which there will be academic inequality,
because there will be unequally distributed universality (as far as the variety of
subjects and disciplines are concerned) and varying degrees of scientiﬁc quality
and excellence. It is an illusion to believe that with regard to scientiﬁc quality any
university system may continue to be run as an essentially homogeneous system
– as once many (often signiﬁcantly smaller) institutions were run. In the long run,
keeping homogeneity as the measure of all university affairs will inevitably lead
to rampant mediocrity.

Universality and other virtues
A university meeting the requirements mentioned above must either answer or be
able to demonstrate its institutional response to the following questions: what
level of universality does a university need to attain before it can live up to its
name? How much plurality does a university need to establish a speciﬁc identity?
How much quality is needed before excellence can emerge?
The ﬁrst question is what level of universality a university needs to attain before it
really becomes a university. Despite all tendencies toward specialisation, academic
knowledge is something that only thrives on a ﬁeld kept by all involved parties.
Great achievement requires not only specialised knowledge, but also close contact to
other areas. Robert Boyle was a physicist and chemist, Gottlob Frege a mathema-
tician and philosopher, Max Weber was a sociologist and historian, Max Delbru¨ck a
biologist and physicist. In their cases, disciplinary boundaries did not determine their
actual achievements – on the contrary, these boundaries had to be overcome before
great achievements could be attained. This is also and especially true for modern
developments. New insights most often form on the edges of ﬁelds and disciplines,
and not at the core, where textbook knowledge is at home. Thus, universality, in its
institutional forms of ﬁelds and disciplines, cannot be restricted arbitrarily: in
departmental or disciplinary greenhouses, research and teaching can only thrive to a
certain degree. Access to environments external to that of the university must remain
open, and open in both directions: one must be able to get outside when one is
looking for complementary knowledge, and others with the same desire must be able
to get in. This means that the university must hold to its claim to universality.
Second, how much plurality does a university need to establish a speciﬁc identity?
Disciplinary plurality bestows upon the university a sense of self, the sense of being
a real university. If this plurality is not present, this sense of being a university will
not develop, and universities will remain mere schools. In such cases, the unity of
research and teaching still deﬁnes itself by what a circumscribed part of academia
knows, but this means that it is deﬁned by a closed form of research, and not the
open one that is one of the characteristics of today’s inter- or trans-disciplinary
perspective. The paradigm of the school replaces that of the university. The uni-
versity as an institution of teaching displaces the university as a research institution;
the unity of research and teaching loses its content and coagulates in rhetoric.
Third, how much quality is needed before excellence can emerge? Universities are
institutions of higher learning in the sense that university teaching develops out of
university research, and thus remains connected to the latter through teaching and
learning. If teaching and learning are disconnected from research, or remain con-
nected to the latter only by the memory of the teacher’s own learning, such terms as
‘academic’ and ‘scientiﬁc’, or the German ‘wissenschaftlich’ lose their meaning. In
this case, university teaching and learning are no longer distinguished from other,

S185

non-academic, teaching and learning. Academic achievement of a high calibre and
scientiﬁc excellence are once again only possible in an environment that is con-
ducive to achievement, which stimulates and furthers academic achievement through
academic achievement itself. Although mediocre conditions do not necessarily
exclude a high level of achievement, or occasional feats of excellence, this will
remain the exception. In general, mediocre conditions are a programme for academic
mediocrity, true to Andre´ Weil’s law of university hiring: ﬁrst-rate people hire other
ﬁrst-rate people, but second-rate people hire third-rate people. A university needs a
lot of academic quality if academic excellence is to be developed. And this quality
cannot be found in isolated ﬁelds or on disciplinary islands, but should be pursued in
an academic and scientiﬁc context deﬁned by quality and excellence. Differentiation
and diversiﬁcation are the engine that drives the development of the university, and
thus, of higher education.
Quality and the researcher
The ﬁnal question that has to be answered is how individuals involved in
teaching and research do in view of the fact that the institutions at which they
work increasingly have to meet economic and regulatory demands. In the fol-
lowing discussion, I shall use quality assessment and the organisational structure
of research as examples.
In the 1960s and 1970s, universities had to cope with the fact that all uni-
versity relations had to be assessed ﬁrst in sociological terms and then in didactic
terms. The present credo is that of evaluation: ‘I am evaluated, therefore I am’
could be the motto of today’s higher education institutions, and this perspective is
rapidly becoming omnipresent at all institutional levels.2
Quality assessment procedures for higher education institutions in Europe
were ﬁrst developed in the mid-1980s. Most European countries have systems of
quality assessment or quality assurance at their disposal. This development has
been spurred by the desire to give more autonomy to higher education institu-
tions and to ask for efﬁcient accountability. This is a noble aim, but the methods
chosen to attain it are wrong. The danger is that by attempting to subject the
academic practice to standardised criteria, it may lose its essential capacity. In the
case of science, this essence is in the discovery of what is new. This may come
in many ways, well-known and new. Therefore, optimal methods are not easy to
lay down from the start and cannot be restricted by rules to be followed and
controlled, for example in terms of quality. This is related to the fact that in
science – as in many other social areas – people are the essential factor, not the
routines they follow (in which people are viewed as interchangeable commod-
ities). It is the researcher who is at the centre of successful research, not the
research system, be it assessed or not.
S186
Ju¨rgen Mittelstrass

Moreover, quality cannot be deﬁned independently of given circumstances –
aims, goals, methods, subjects. There is no general deﬁnition of quality, and no
model that could stand for all areas in which quality is at stake. This applies also
to research and teaching, which is why quality assessment in (institutions of)
higher education is still, in a way, an art without a master. This again means that,
on the one hand, quality assessment is a (mostly imperfect) tool supposed to
solve problems of academic self-perception, and, on the other, a problem in itself.
The fact that there exists a constantly growing industry of assessment and eva-
luation should not deceive us. Where everybody assesses everybody else – and
we are moving in this direction – the blade of criticism becomes blunt; what in
former times used to serve well-deﬁned aims of optimising research and teaching
becomes an end in itself. We know this from science policy studies, namely from
(empirical) research about the way in which, and under what institutional con-
ditions, research is carried out. But this does not make research better – rather, it
considers it as an object that can be examined like any other object.
This particularly applies to research. A peculiar terminology is spreading.
When today we refer to research, we primarily mean research groups, temporary
grant-funded research centres, clusters, and alliances. Research appears, ﬁrst of
all, as something that needs to be organised, not as something that is the project
of the person actually doing the research. The concept of research itself is
changing. While it used to be closely connected to the researcher, this connection
is starting to dissolve. The search for truth, which used to be part of the self-
conception of the scientist and was what turned him or her into a researcher to
begin with, becomes research as an organisation, i.e. a process to be organised,
behind which the scientist is disappearing.3 The individual scholar engaged in
research becomes ‘research’; that is to say, he or she becomes institutionalised
and de-individualised in specialised research institutions. Owing to their teaching
requirements, universities are ever less in a position to present themselves as
such. Instead, research becomes the ‘business’ of institutions speciﬁcally foun-
ded for this purpose, especially in the areas of natural science and technology.
Research as an individual form of life thus turns into research as business,
organised in teams, one-off research projects, and research alliances. We are
driving the individual out of research – and out of teaching, too, to the extent that
with the Bologna process the standardisation of teaching will increase, turning
the university more and more into a school – the teacher is disappearing behind
organised processes.
Final remark
We cannot foresee the future of the university. But what we discover does not
bode well, at least not for those of us who still believe in the ideal of the

university or do not conceive of research as just another job. The university,
which nowadays is talked about in a strange administrative and economic lan-
guage, no longer corresponds to any theory or idea, and the conviction that
science in teaching and research is not just another job, but a way of life, is being
exorcised from those working in it. We need to beware of letting the university
system erode in this manner. Such a system would lose research to extra-uni-
versity institutions once and for all, and universities would evolve into mere
teaching institutions. That too could be one of the messages of our conference.
