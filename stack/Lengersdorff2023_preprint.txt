Abstract 
11 
Influential accounts claim that violent video games (VVG) decrease players' emotional empathy by 
12 
desensitizing them to both virtual and real-life violence. However, scientific evidence for this claim is 
13 
inconclusive and controversially debated. To assess the causal effect of VVGs on the behavioral and neural 
14 
correlates of empathy and emotional reactivity to violence, we conducted a prospective experimental 
15 
study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We recruited eighty-nine male participants 
16 
without prior VVG experience. Over the course of two weeks, participants played either a highly violent 
17 
video game, or a non-violent version of the same game. Before and after this period, participants 
18 
completed an fMRI experiment with paradigms measuring their empathy for pain and emotional 
19 
reactivity to violent images. Applying a Bayesian analysis approach throughout enabled us to find 
20 
substantial evidence for the absence of an effect of VVGs on the behavioral and neural correlates of 
21 
empathy. Moreover, participants in the VVG group were not desensitized to images of real-world 
22 
violence. These results imply that short and controlled exposure to VVGs does not numb empathy nor the 
23 
responses to real-world violence. We discuss the implications of our findings regarding the potential and 
24 
limitations of experimental research on the causal effects of VVGs.

Introduction 
26 
Video games have evolved into one of the most popular forms of entertainment. In Europe, 25% of the 
27 
population report playing video games weekly, and especially young adults spend much time in these 
28 
“virtual worlds” (IPSOS MediaCT, 2012). Many popular games contain high levels of violent imagery, with 
29 
the killing or hurting of other characters being deeply engrained in the gameplay (Gentile et al., 2004; 
30 
Krantz et al., 2017).  Many recent studies have investigated whether such violent video games (VVGs)  
31 
have adverse effects on real world social behavior and empathy (Anderson et al., 2010). According to the 
32 
influential General Aggression Model (Bushman & Anderson, 2002), VVGs should decrease the players' 
33 
empathy for the pain of others by desensitizing them to both virtual and real violence. Such desensitizing 
34 
effects should in turn be reflected by decreased activity in brain areas underpinning empathy, such as the 
35 
anterior insula (AI) and the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) (Lamm et al., 2011, 2019). However, the 
36 
evidence for this prediction is mixed. While some studies found that playing VVGs leads to emotional 
37 
desensitization on the behavioral and neural level (Arriaga et al., 2011; Bartholow et al., 2006; Carnagey 
38 
et al., 2007; Engelhardt et al., 2011; Staude-Müller et al., 2008), other studies failed to reveal such effects 
39 
(Gao et al., 2017; Kühn et al., 2019; Szycik, Mohammadi, Hake, et al., 2017; Szycik, Mohammadi, Münte, 
40 
et al., 2017). Conflicting results are also found on the level of systematic reviews (de Vrieze, 2018a; 
41 
Mathur & VanderWeele, 2019). Several meta-analyses suggest that VVGs exert small, yet consistent 
42 
adverse effects on aggression and empathy (Anderson et al., 2010; Calvert et al., 2017; Greitemeyer & 
43 
Mügge, 2014; Mathur & VanderWeele, 2019; Prescott et al., 2018). Other researchers contest these 
44 
results, claiming that results are a product of selective reporting and biased analyses (Ferguson & Kilburn, 
45 
2010; Hilgard, Engelhardt, & Rouder, 2017).  
46 
A key question is whether VVGs are causally responsible for low empathy, or whether less empathic 
47 
individuals are more likely to play VVGs (Bushman & Anderson, 2015; Ferguson et al., 2008). Many studies 
48 
have been quasi-experimental in nature, comparing the empathic responses of participants who 
49 

4 
 
habitually play VVGs with those of participants without VVG experience (Bartholow et al., 2005, 2006; 
50 
Gentile et al., 2016; Krahe et al., 2011). Such designs provide limited information on the direction of the 
51 
causal link between VVGs and decreased empathy. The existing experimental studies have nearly always 
52 
used VVGs as an experimental manipulation shortly before measuring the outcomes of interest, possibly 
53 
confounding persistent effects of VVGs with short-term effects such as arousal or priming (Arriaga et al., 
54 
2011; Bushman & Anderson, 2009; Carnagey et al., 2007; Engelhardt et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2013; Staude-
55 
Müller et al., 2008). It is therefore essential to conduct experimental studies that can disentangle the 
56 
long- and short-term effects of VVGs in participants without prior VVG experience. One first such study 
57 
was conducted by Kühn and colleagues (2019) who found no significant effects of VVGs on empathy and 
58 
its neural correlates. While this study was an important starting point, four important design features 
59 
limited its conclusions. First, the researchers used very dissimilar games in the experimental group versus 
60 
the control group, restricting the comparability of the two conditions. Second, while the participants of 
61 
the experimental group were asked to play the violent game Grand Theft Auto V (Rockstar Studios) for 
62 
thirty minutes per day over two months, the authors did not control the degree to which participants 
63 
actually played the game. Third, the authors did not control that participants actually committed violent 
64 
acts within the game, as the game offers a large amount of gameplay without violent content. Fourth, the 
65 
absence of significant results was interpreted as evidence for the absence of VVG effects. However, the 
66 
authors did not report the results of equivalence tests (Lakens et al., 2018) or Bayesian hypothesis tests 
67 
(Keysers et al., 2020) that would support such claims conclusively (Hilgard, Engelhardt, Bartholow, et al., 
68 
2017). In view of the many conflicting results reported by experimental research and even meta-analyses 
69 
(de Vrieze, 2018b; Mathur & VanderWeele, 2019), clearly differentiating between "absence of evidence" 
70 
and "evidence of absence" is particularly important. 
71 
To test possible causal effects of VVGs on empathy and its neural correlates, we conducted an 
72 
experimental prospective study, which addressed each of these limitations. Eighty-nine male participants 
73 

5 
 
with little to no prior VVG experience repeatedly played a modified version of Grand Theft Auto V over 
74 
the course of two weeks. Participants in the experimental group played a highly violent version of the 
75 
game and were tasked to kill as many other characters as possible. Participants of the control group 
76 
played a version of the same game from which all violent content was removed, and were asked to 
77 
perform a non-violent task (taking photographs of other characters). Before and after this gaming period, 
78 
participants completed an fMRI session during which we measured the behavioral and neural correlates 
79 
of empathy for pain and emotional reactivity to violent images (see Figure 1 and Methods: experimental 
80 
fMRI sessions for details). We used Bayesian hypothesis tests to assess whether there were negative 
81 
effects of VVGs on participants' empathic behavior and neural responses. Hypothesis tests were 
82 
performed by means of the Bayes Factor (BF; Kass & Raftery, 1995). We followed the convention to report 
83 
a BF > 3 as evidence for the alternative hypothesis, a BF < 1/3 as evidence for the null hypothesis, and a 
84 
BF in the interval [1/3, 3] as inconclusive evidence for either hypothesis (Kass & Raftery, 1995; Keysers et 
85 
al., 2020). Our aim was to provide conclusive evidence on the question whether VVGs can desensitize 
86 
humans to the plight of others or not, within our carefully balanced experimental model.

Figure 1. Schematic depiction of the experimental tasks. A) Empathy-for-pain task. In trials of the Self condition, 
90 
participants passively received electrical stimuli. In the Other condition, participants experienced how another 
91 
person (a confederate) received electrical stimuli. The stimuli were either painful or not painful. In the cue phase, 
92 
an arrow indicated the recipient (downwards: Self; right: Other) and the intensity (blue: not painful; red: painful) of 
93 
the next stimulus. In the stimulation phase, the stimulus was delivered. After half of the trials, participants were 
94 
asked to rate the last stimulus. B) Emotional reactivity task. Participants were presented pictures with different 
95 
content (violent or neutral) and different context (real or game context). After observing a block of pictures, 
96 
participants rated their current unpleasantness on a visual analoge scale from 0 to 100.

Empathy for pain 
100 
To test our central hypothesis, we investigated if participants who played the violent video game showed 
101 
decreased empathy for pain on the behavioral level. We analyzed the ratings obtained during the 
102 
empathy-for-pain task with a hierarchical Bayesian censored regression model. We modelled fixed effects 
103 
for the experimental factors Group (non-violent vs. violent gaming, coded as -1 and 1), Time (pre vs. post 
104 
gaming sessions, coded as -1 and 1), and Intensity (non-painful vs. painful stimulation of the confederate, 
105 
coded as -1 and 1), as well as all interactions between these factors. See Methods, Data analysis, for more 
106 
details.  As a manipulation check, we first tested whether painful stimuli led to increased painfulness and 
107 
unpleasantness ratings, compared to non-painful stimuli. For both kinds of ratings, this test revealed very 
108 
strong evidence (BF > 100) for an effect of Intensity, indicating that our paradigm was able to induce 
109 
empathic responses in participants (see Figure 2A & B).  
110 
We found evidence for the absence of a VVG effect on the painfulness ratings. Comparing a model where 
111 
the fixed effect of Group*Time*Intensity could be negative to a model where the effect was set to zero 
112 
resulted in a BF of 0.324. This means that the observed ratings were about 3.1 times more likely under 
113 
the null hypothesis of no VVG effect than under the alternative hypothesis. The posterior means of fixed 
114 
effect parameters are listed in Table 1.A. For the unpleasantness ratings, evidence for absence of a VVG 
115 
effect was substantial. With a BF of 0.130, the observed data were about 7.7 times more likely under the 
116 
null hypothesis of no VVG effect than under the alternative hypothesis. The posterior means of fixed 
117 
effect parameters of this model are listed in Table 1.B. In summary, the behavioral data suggest that 
118 
violent video game play as implemented in this study has no effect on either type of empathy rating.

Emotional reactivity

Next, we investigated whether playing the violent video game desensitized participants towards 
138 
depictions of violence. We again used a hierarchical Bayesian censored regression model, and included 
139 
fixed effects for the experimental factors Group (non-violent vs. violent gaming, coded as -1 and 1), 
140 
Content (neutral vs. violent, coded as -1 and 1), and Context (real vs. game, coded as -1 and 1). As a 
141 
manipulation check, we first tested whether participants experienced more unpleasantness in the 
142 
emotional reactivity task while observing violent pictures compared to neutral pictures. We found very 
143 
strong evidence (BF > 100) for this hypothesis, indicating that our paradigm was successful in inducing 
144 
unpleasantness by violent imagery. The unpleasantness ratings are depicted in Figure 2C.

Further, we found substantial evidence for the absence of a desensitizing VVG effect. Comparing a model 
146 
where the fixed effect of Group*Content could be negative to a model where the effect was set to zero 
147 
resulted in a BF of 0.151. Thus, participants of the violent game group did not show a decreased emotional 
148 
response towards depictions of real and game violence. Moreover, testing the fixed effect of 
149 
Group*Content*Context resulted in a BF of 0.094, indicating that there was also no desensitizing effect 
150 
that was specific to depictions of game violence. The posterior means of fixed effect parameters of this 
151 
model are listed in Table 2. In summary, the behavioral data suggest that playing the violent video game 
152 
did not emotionally desensitize participants towards violent images.

fMRI data 
171 
Empathy for pain 
172 
We next analyzed the fMRI data collected during the empathy-for-pain task. To define our ROIs, we first 
173 
performed whole-brain general linear model (GLM) analysis of the data of the first fMRI session. Our 
174 
contrast of interest [Other Pain - Other No Pain] compared brain activity when the confederate 
175 
experienced painful stimulation to activity when the confederate experienced only non-painful 
176 
stimulation (see Methods: Data analysis for details). This revealed significant clusters in our a priori 
177 
defined brain areas of interest, aMCC and bilateral AI, as well as in other areas, including the left 
178 
supramarginal gyrus and the right angular gyrus (see Figure 3A, and Appendix 3 for detailed results). 
179 
Subsequently, we performed Bayesian linear mixed effects analyses on the data extracted from the ROIs 
180 
(aMCC, left AI, right AI). See Methods: Data analysis for details. We compared models where the fixed 
181 
effect of Group*Time*Intensity could be negative to a model where the effect was set to zero. For 
182 
responses in the Cue phase (where participants were informed whether the other person would receive 
183 
a painful or a non-painful stimulus), we obtained the following BFs: BFaMCC = 0.402; BFleft AI = 0.547; BFright 
184 
AI = 0.190. For responses in the Stimulation phase (where participants observed the other person receiving 
185 
the stimulus), we obtained the following BFs: BFaMCC = 0.176; BFleft AI = 0.143; BFright AI = 0.434. See Appendix 
186 
4 – table 1 for posterior distributions and Bayes factors of all model parameters. In summary, we found 
187 
weak to moderate evidence for the absence of an effect of playing the violent video game on participants’ 
188 
brain activity while they observed another person in pain. 
189 
Emotional reactivity 
190 
Our next analysis concerned the fMRI data coming from the emotional reactivity task. To define our ROIs,  
191 
we computed the contrast [Violent – Neutral], comparing brain activity during observation of violent 
192 
images to brain activity during observation of images with neutral content (see Methods: Data analysis 
193 
for details). This revealed significant clusters in one of our a priori areas of interest, the bilateral amygdala, 
194 

12 
 
as well as several other regions, such as the bilateral fusiform gyrus and the bilateral precentral gyrus (see 
195 
Figure 3B, and Appendix 3 for detailed results). However, we found no significant clusters in the other 
196 
brain regions of interest, the aMCC or the bilateral AI. Therefore, we restricted our subsequent ROI 
197 
analysis to the amygdala. 
198 
We performed Bayesian linear mixed effects analyses on the data extracted from the amygdala. See 
199 
Methods: Data analysis for details. First, we compared a model where the fixed effect of Group*Content 
200 
could be negative to a model where the effect was set to zero. This resulted in a BF of 0.324 for the left 
201 
amygdala, and a BF of 0.338 for the right amygdala, indicating absence of an effect in both ROIs. Next, we 
202 
tested the fixed effect of Group*Content*Context. With a BF of 0.205 for the left amygdala, and 0.163 for 
203 
the right amygdala, this analysis also indicated the absence of an effect. See Appendix 4 – table 2 for 
204 
posterior distributions and Bayes factors of all model parameters. In summary, the data suggest that 
205 
playing the violent video game did not lead to a dampened brain response to images of violence in neither 
206 
real nor gaming contexts.

Discussion 
214 
Influential theories of media violence predict that the repeated playing of VVGs results in decreased 
215 
empathy for pain due to a desensitization to real world violence (Anderson et al., 2010; Bushman & 
216 
Anderson, 2002). Here, we report evidence against this hypothesis in relation to our specific setting. We 
217 
found that participants who repeatedly played a highly violent game for seven hours over the course of 
218 
two weeks did not show decreased empathy for another person's pain or decreased responses to violent 
219 
imagery. 
220 
Our findings contrast with several earlier studies that found a negative relationship between playing VVGs 
221 
and empathic responses to violence. Importantly, the majority of these studies were quasi-experimental 
222 
in nature, and therefore provide only limited evidence for a putative causal effect of violent gaming 
223 
(Bartholow et al., 2005, 2006; Gentile et al., 2016; Krahe et al., 2011). Moreover, the few experimental 
224 
studies that exist implemented designs investigating short-term carry over effects, as they had exposed 
225 
participants to virtual violence rather immediately before measurements of their outcome variables of 
226 
interest (Arriaga et al., 2011; Bushman & Anderson, 2009; Carnagey et al., 2007; Engelhardt et al., 2011; 
227 
Guo et al., 2013; Staude-Müller et al., 2008). Together with the study of Kühn and colleagues (2019), our 
228 
study is one of the first to investigate persistent effects of VVGs in participants without prior experience 
229 
with them, enabling a clear assessment of the causality of VVG effects. Importantly, our study was 
230 
designed to address several limitations of the study of Kühn et al.: We strictly controlled the amount of 
231 
virtual violence actually experienced by participants, and used a non-violent version of the same game in 
232 
the control condition; moreover, we applied a Bayesian analytical approach, which, together with our 
233 
comparatively large sample size, enabled us from the outset to distinguish "absence of evidence" from 
234 
"evidence of absence" of VVG effects. This approach yields consistent evidence from both behavioral and 
235 
neural data that violent video games, to the extent and characteristics played in our interventional design, 
236 
are not causally responsible for a persistent lack of empathy or emotional desensitization to violence. 
237 

15 
 
Despite the aforementioned strengths of our study, we also need to address several limitations. Our 
238 
experimental design ensured that participants of the experimental group were exposed to a great amount 
239 
of violent gameplay during gaming sessions (each participant „killed“ an average of 2000 other characters 
240 
in a graphically violent way). However, the overall exposure to virtual violence was still relatively low 
241 
when compared to the amount that is possible in the everyday life of habitual VVG players. Our results 
242 
cannot preclude that longer and more intense exposure to VVGs could have negative causal effects on 
243 
empathy. In particular, adolescents and children as well as persons with specific neuropsychiatric traits 
244 
might be especially susceptible to long-term changes due to increased brain plasticity. However, 
245 
empirically testing higher levels of violence with the same degree of control as realized in our study would 
246 
reach the limits of practical feasibility. We thus believe that our results provide an important perspective 
247 
on the size of VVG effects that could realistically be expected in experimental research. 
248 
To maximize the amount of violence that participants would be exposed to (and commit) in the game, we 
249 
restricted the game’s objective to killing other characters, and incentivized this behavior with monetary 
250 
rewards. This might have reduced the ecological validity of our operationalization of gaming, and it is 
251 
possible that bigger effects could be seen when violent gameplay is more internally motivated, i.e. 
252 
individuals who want to play the game may be differently affected than those that have merely accepted 
253 
to be part of an experiment.  Still, our results provide valid evidence that the mere playing of such games 
254 
for seven hours over two weeks is not sufficient to decrease empathy.  
255 
In summary, our findings stand in contrast to claims that posit the playing of violent games as an essential 
256 
factor for explaining decreases in empathy. If this is shown to generalize to when people play more often 
257 
and over longer periods, the desensitization to violence described in prior reports using quasi-
258 
experimental designs might have been caused by third and pre-existing factors, such as education, socio-
259 
economic status, or mental health issues (DeCamp & Ferguson, 2016; Lemmens & Bushman, 2006; Shao 
260 
& Wang, 2019; Tortolero et al., 2014). Together with similar findings (Kühn et al., 2019), our results point 
261 

16 
 
out the limits to which VVGs can be held responsible for lacks of empathy, at least in highly controlled 
262 
experimental settings that last for the two weeks of play implemented here. This is not to say, though, 
263 
that there is no point in further investigating the complex relationships between violent media use and 
264 
adverse social behavior. We propose that the design and analysis approach of the present study could act 
265 
a reference of how future studies should be conducted, in order to increase the stringency and robustness 
266 
of research in this domain. Together with our findings, such studies will aid in resolving the scientific 
267 
controversy regarding the negative effects of violent video games (de Vrieze, 2018a; Mathur & 
268 
VanderWeele, 2019), and contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between violent media 
269 
and emotion. 
270 
Methods 
271 
Participants 
272 
We planned to collect data from 90 participants. We derived this sample size from a power analysis based 
273 
on average VVG effect sizes reported in (Anderson et al., 2010). In total, 97 participants completed the 
274 
first experimental session. Of these, eight participants dropped out of the study (six before the first video 
275 
game sessions; two after, of which one was from the experimental group and one from the control group). 
276 
We thus acquired complete datasets from 89 participants.  
277 
To control for previous VVG exposure, we only included individuals that had not played VVGs at least 
278 
twelve months before testing, and had not played the video game Grand Theft Auto V before. We tested 
279 
only male participants, as more males than females play violent video games regularly (Gentile et al., 
280 
2004; Krahé & Möller, 2004; Padilla-Walker et al., 2010). Moreover, males have been shown to be more 
281 
easily influenced by violent media (Bartholow & Anderson, 2002; Bettencourt & Kernahan, 1997). To 
282 
further increase homogeneity of the sample, we restricted the age range of possible participants to 18-
283 
35 years. Additional inclusion criteria were no history of neurological or psychatric disorders or drug 
284 

17 
 
abuse, and standard inclusion criteria for MRI measurements. Participants were recruited through online 
285 
advertisements and received a financial compensation of €145 for participating in all experimental 
286 
sessions. A performance-linked bonus of up to €35 acted as an additional incentive during the game 
287 
sessions. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna (decision 
288 
number 1258/2017).  
289 
Overall study design 
290 
Participants were randomly assigned to the violent game group or the control game group. Participants 
291 
first completed a pretest fMRI session, during which they performed an experimental task designed to 
292 
measure empathy for pain. Then, over the course of two weeks, participants of the violent game group 
293 
repeatedly played a violent video game, while the control game group played a non-violent version of the 
294 
same game. Subsequently, both groups completed the posttest fMRI session. Here, participants 
295 
performed the empathy-for-pain paradigm again, and also completed a task designed to measure 
296 
emotional reactivity to violent pictures. 
297 
Experimental fMRI sessions 
298 
Confederate 
299 
To facilitate empathic responses during the experimental tasks, participants completed the experimental 
300 
session together with a male confederate. The confederate acted as if he were a second participant of 
301 
the experiment. This deception was maintained until the end of the last experimental session, at which 
302 
point participants were debriefed. 
303 
Pain calibration 
304 
The empathy-for-pain paradigm included the administration of painful but tolerable stimuli. The physical 
305 
pain was induced via a well-established procedure (e.g., Rütgen, Seidel, Silani, et al., 2015). Electrical 
306 
stimuli were produced by a Digitimer DS5 stimulator (Digitimer Ltd, Clinical & Biomedical Research 
307 

18 
 
Instruments, United Kingdom) and delivered by electrodes placed on the dorsum of the left hand. 
308 
Subjective pain thresholds were determined using a standardized calibration procedure. The participant 
309 
received short (500 ms) stimuli of increasing intensity and was asked to rate pain intensity on a numeric 
310 
scale (0 = "not perceptible"; 1 = "perceptible, but not painful", 3 = "a little painful", 5 = "moderately 
311 
painful", 7 = "very painful", 9 = "extremely painful, highest tolerable pain"). The average intensities of 
312 
stimuli rated as 1 and 7 were then chosen as the intensities of the non-painful and painful stimulation 
313 
conditions during the empathy-for-pain task.  
314 
Empathy-for-pain paradigm 
315 
We used a well-established paradigm to measure participants’ empathic responses (Hartmann et al., 
316 
2021; Rütgen, Seidel, Riečanský, et al., 2015; Rütgen, Seidel, Silani, et al., 2015; Singer et al., 2004). 
317 
Participants either received electric stimuli themselves (Self condition), or saw images of the confederate 
318 
indicating that he was currently receiving electric stimulation (Other condition). The stimuli were either 
319 
painful (Pain condition) or perceptible but not painful (No Pain condition). The timeline of the task is 
320 
illustrated in Figure 1A. At the start of each trial, a downwards or rightwards arrow (presented for 2 s) 
321 
indicated whether the next stimulus would be delivered to the participant or the confederate, 
322 
respectively (Cue phase). Red and blue arrows indicated painful and non-painful stimulation, respectively. 
323 
After a jittered interval [3-7 s], the stimulus was delivered (Stimulation phase). In the Self condition, the 
324 
participant received the electrical stimulus (0.5 s), and saw a pixelated photograph (1 s). In the Other 
325 
condition, the participant saw a photograph of the confederate with a neutral or painful facial expression. 
326 
After half of the trials, participants rated the last stimulus on a 100-step visual analog scale (VAS). In the 
327 
Self condition, participants rated how painful the last stimulus was for themselves. In the Other condition, 
328 
participants rated how painful the stimulus was for the confederate (other-oriented painfulness rating), 
329 
and how unpleasant it was for themselves to observe the confederate receiving the stimulus (self-
330 
oriented unpleasantness rating). In total, there were 64 trials, with 16 trials per condition (Self Pain, Self 
331 

19 
 
No Pain, Other Pain, Other No Pain). Conditions were presented in a pseudorandomized order. The task 
332 
was presented using COGENT (http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent.php), implemented in MATLAB 2017b 
333 
(The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The total task duration was approx. 20 min. 
334 
Emotional reactivity paradigm:  
335 
To investigate emotional reactivity to violent images, we used an affective picture paradigm (Olofsson et 
336 
al., 2008; Petrovic et al., 2005). Participants were shown pictures of either neutral or violent content 
337 
(factor Content). Additionally, the pictures depicted either real scenes, or scenes taken from the video 
338 
game participants played during the gaming sessions (factor Context). Real pictures were taken from the 
339 
International Affective Pictures System (IAPS; Lang et al., 2005). Game pictures were matched to IAPS 
340 
pictures in terms of content, valence and arousal (see Appendix 1). 
341 
The sequence of events of the task is illustrated in Figure 1B. Each block consisted of five pictures of the 
342 
same condition, presented for 3 seconds each, and with a short interval of 0.2 seconds between pictures. 
343 
After a jittered interval [3-7 s] participants rated how unpleasant they felt on a 100-step VAS. In total, 
344 
participants saw 16 blocks of pictures, with 4 blocks per condition (Neutral Real, Neutral Game, Violent 
345 
Real, Violent Game). The task was presented using COGENT, and total task duration was approx. 5 min. 
346 
To avoid that participants formed expectations about the purpose of the study early on, participants 
347 
completed this task only in the second fMRI session. 
348 
MRI data acquisition 
349 
MRI data were acquired with a 3T Siemens Skyra MRI system (Siemens Medical, Erlangen, Germany) and 
350 
a 32-channel head coil. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional imaging was performed using a 
351 
multiband-accelerated echoplanar imaging sequence with the following parameters: Echo time (TE): 34 
352 
ms; Repetition time (TR): 1200ms; flip angle: 66°; interleaved ascending acquisition; 52 axial slices 
353 
coplanar to the connecting line between anterior and posterior commissure; multiband acceleration 
354 

20 
 
factor 4, resulting in 13 excitations per TR; field-of-view: 192 ×192 × 124.8 mm, matrix size: 96 × 96, voxel 
355 
size: 2×2×2 mm, interslice gap 0.4 mm. Structural images were acquired using a magnetization-prepared 
356 
rapid gradient-echo sequence with the following parameters: TE = 2.43 ms; TR = 2300 ms; 208 sagittal 
357 
slices; field-of-view: 256×256×166 mm; voxel size: 0.8×0.8×0.8 mm. To correct functional images for 
358 
inhomogeneities of the magnetic field, field map images were acquired using a double echo gradient echo 
359 
sequence with the following parameters: TE1/TE2: 4.92/7.38 ms; TR = 400 ms; flip angle: 60°; 36 axial 
360 
slices with the same orientation as the functional images; field-of-view: 220×220×138 mm; matrix size: 
361 
128×128×36; voxel size: 1.72×1.72×3.85 mm. 
362 
Gaming sessions 
363 
Between the two fMRI sessions, participants came seven times to the laboratory to play a video game for 
364 
one hour. Intervals between subsequent gaming sessions were approximately 24 - 48h, and the second 
365 
fMRI session was completed at least 24h after the last gaming session. Participants of both groups played 
366 
a modified version of the game Grand Theft Auto V. In the violent game group, participants controlled a 
367 
male character equipped with a close-combat weapon, and were tasked to kill as many other characters 
368 
as possible. Killing was graphically violent, as hitting a character was accompanied by the splattering of 
369 
blood, realistic animations of injury, and screams. In the control game group, participants played a version 
370 
of the game in which all violence was removed. The player character had no weapon, and could not hurt 
371 
other characters in any way. In this condition, participants were tasked to take photographs of as many 
372 
other characters as possible. In both groups, participants could also freely explore the world of the game. 
373 
To incentivize a high number of violent or non-violent acts, each kill or photograph was rewarded with 
374 
one point. For every two points, participants were paid out +0.01€ at the end of the study.  
375 

21 
 
Data analysis 
376 
In this paper, we follow a Bayesian data analysis approach (Keysers et al., 2020), which allows clear 
377 
assessments of the presence or absence of an effect of VVGs on empathy. Hypothesis tests were 
378 
performed by means of the Bayes Factor (BF; Kass & Raftery, 1995). The BF represents how much more 
379 
probable the observed data is under the alternative hypothesis compared to the null hypothesis. A well-
380 
established convention is to report a BF > 3 as evidence for the alternative hypothesis, a BF < 1/3 as 
381 
evidence for the null hypothesis, and a BF in the interval [1/3, 3] as inconclusive evidence for either 
382 
hypothesis (Kass & Raftery, 1995; Keysers et al., 2020). We formulated informed priors for all models to 
383 
enable valid BF hypothesis tests (Vanpaemel, 2010). To increase comparability with the results of previous 
384 
papers, we also report analogous frequentist analyses in the Appendix 5. We registered the analysis plan 
385 
of this study at https://osf.io/yx423/.  
386 
Behavioral data analysis 
387 
To test the effects of VVGs on behavioral measures of empathy for pain, we analyzed the VAS ratings 
388 
obtained during the empathy-for-pain task with hierarchical Bayesian censored regression models. We 
389 
used censored regression models to account for the fact that participants could give no ratings lower than 
390 
0, or higher than 100.  Models were estimated using the R package brms (Bürkner, 2017). We modelled 
391 
fixed effects for the experimental factors Group (non-violent vs. violent gaming, coded as -1 and 1), Time 
392 
(pre vs. post gaming sessions, coded as -1 and 1), and Intensity (non-painful vs. painful stimulation of the 
393 
confederate, coded as -1 and 1), as well as all interactions between these factors. Additionally, we 
394 
modelled per-subject random effects of Time, Intensity, and these factors' interaction term. To further 
395 
account for variations in how participants used the VAS rating scale, we modelled per-subject error 
396 
variance terms. For further details about the model specification and prior formulation, see Appendix 2.  
397 
We used the same kind of model to test possible desensitizing effects of VVGs on emotional reactivity to 
398 
violent images. Here, we modelled fixed effects for the experimental factors Group (non-violent vs. 
399 

22 
 
violent gaming, coded as -1 and 1), Content (neutral vs. violent, coded as -1 and 1), and Context (real vs. 
400 
game, coded as -1 and 1). Additionally, we modelled per-subject random effects for Content, Context, and 
401 
their interaction, as well as per-subject error variances.  
402 
MRI data preprocessing 
403 
Preprocessing and analysis of fMRI data were performed using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for 
404 
Neuroimaging, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) implemented in MATLAB 2017b. Functional images were slice 
405 
timed and referenced to the middle slice, realigned to the mean image, and unwarped using the acquired 
406 
field map. The structural image was co-registered to the mean image of the realigned functional images 
407 
using mutual information maximization, and structural and functional images were normalized to the 
408 
stereotactic Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The normalized functional images were 
409 
smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (4 mm, full-width-at-half-maximum). To remove motion-related 
410 
artifacts, the functional images were then subjected to an independent-component-analysis based 
411 
algorithm for automatic removal of motion artifacts (Pruim, Mennes, Buitelaar, et al., 2015; Pruim, 
412 
Mennes, van Rooij, et al., 2015), implemented using the FMRIB software library (FSL v5.0; 
413 
http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl).  
414 
fMRI analyses: empathy for pain 
415 
With regards to empathy, our central interest lay in modulations of AI and ACC activity. To identify the 
416 
regions in which empathic responses were reliably elicited independently of our experimental 
417 
manipulation, we first analyzed the data from the first experimental session. We performed general-linear 
418 
model (GLM) based whole-brain analysis using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, 
419 
www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), implemented in MATLAB 2017b. For each participant, the design matrix 
420 
included regressors for the Cue and Stimulation events, separate for all four combinations of conditions 
421 
(Self No Pain; Self Pain; Other No Pain; Other Pain). As nuisance regressors, we included regressors for 
422 

23 
 
the rating events. We then subjected the beta images of the first-level contrast Other Pain > Other No 
423 
Pain to a one-sample t-test, and identified the voxels in which this contrast was significant and positive 
424 
(p < 0.05 after family-wise error correction). From this, we obtained a binary mask of significant voxels. 
425 
We then intersected this mask with anatomical masks taken from the Automated Anatomical Labeling 
426 
atlas (AAL; Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002). For the AI ROI, the binary mask was intersected with the AAL 
427 
mask of the insula (label IN). For the aMCC ROI, the binary mask was intersected with the AAL masks of 
428 
the anterior and median cingulate and paracingulate gyri (labels ACIN and MCIN). 
429 
We analyzed signal changes extracted from our ROIs with Bayesian linear mixed-effects model tailored 
430 
for fMRI data. Custom code for this analysis with the software STAN (Carpenter et al., 2017) can be found 
431 
at https://osf.io/yx423/. See also the Appendix 2 for more information. The full model included regressors 
432 
for the Cue and Stimulation events, as well as nuisance regressors for rating events.  
433 
fMRI analyses: emotional desensitization 
434 
When testing the effects of VVGs on brain activity during the emotional-reactivity task, our main interest 
435 
lay in a possible modulation of responses in the amygdala, as well as aMCC and AI. To define the 
436 
corresponding ROIs, we first identified the brain areas that were reliably activated by violent imagery, 
437 
independent of the experimental manipulation, using whole-brain GLM analysis. For each participant, the 
438 
design matrix included regressors for the blocks of picture presentations, separate for all four 
439 
combinations of conditions (Neutral Real, Neutral Game, Violent Real, Violent Game). As nuisance 
440 
regressors, we included regressors for the rating events. We then pooled the beta images of the first-level 
441 
contrast Violent > Neutral across both groups, and subjected them to a one-sample t-test. From this, we 
442 
obtained a binary mask of voxels significant at p < 0.05 after family-wise error correction. We then 
443 
intersected this mask with AAL masks to obtain our final ROIs (for AI: label IN; for aMCC: labels ACIN and 
444 
MCIN; for amygdala: label AMYG). We analyzed signal changes extracted from our ROIs with Bayesian 
445 

24 
 
linear mixed-effects model. The full model included regressors for the blocks of picture presentation, as 
446 
well as nuisance regressors for rating events.

Pictures used in the emotional reactivity task 
512 
We conducted a pilot study to match pictures taken from the video game to pictures taken from the 
513 
International Affective Picture System (IAPS; Lang et al., 2005). We preselected 33 IAPS pictures of neutral 
514 
content (people with neutral facial expressions, objects) and 34 IAPS pictures of violent content (dead 
515 
bodies, mutilations, fights, weapons), as well as 33 game pictures of neutral content and 46 games 
516 
pictures of violent content. In an online survey, thirty-one participants (16 female, 15 male) rated these 
517 
pictures in terms of valence and arousal, using the 9-point self-assessment manikin scale (Bradley & Lang, 
518 
1994). 
519 
We calculated the mean values of valence and arousal across participants per picture, and used these 
520 
scores, as well as the individual pictures' content, to select ten pictures per condition as stimuli for the 
521 
emotional reactivity task. The scores for the final selection of pictures are listed in Appendix 3 – table 1. 
522 
Note that after matching, there were still systematic differences between game and real pictues: violent 
523 
real pictures were generally rated higher in arousal, and lower in valence, than violent game pictures. This 
524 
is due to the fact that a matching purely on valence and arousal scores would have led to sets of pictures 
525 
with highly different contents (i.e., real pictures showing mostly fights and threats without blood, and 
526 
game pictures showing mostly dead bodies and highly violent attacks). However, we deemed it important 
527 
that real pictures and game pictures were also as similar in content as possible. Moreover, we believe 
528 
that a difference in valence and arousal between real pictures and game pictures is only a minor issue for 
529 
the experimental design. Our main research question does not concern differences in behavioral and 
530 
neural responses to real vs. game pictures, but how these responses differ between participants who 
531 
played a highly violent video game and participants who played a non-violent video game.  
532 
The game pictures are available at https://osf.io/yx423/ .

Bayesian hierarchical models 
539 
Behavioral data analysis 
540 
We fitted hierarchical censored regression models to the rating data from the empathy-for-pain task and 
541 
the emotional reactivity task. Ratings were collected using a 100-step visual analog scale (VAS), and could 
542 
thus lie in the range [0,100]. For numerical reasons, we first linearly transformed ratings to the range [-
543 
3,3]. In the following, let 𝑖 index participants, and 𝑡 index trials. The censored regression model relates 
544 
𝑦𝑖𝑡, the rating given by participant 𝑖 in trial 𝑡, to a latent response variate 𝑦𝑖𝑡
∗ by the function 
545 
𝑦𝑖𝑡= {
−3,
𝑦𝑖𝑡
∗≤−3
𝑦𝑖𝑡
∗,
−3 < 𝑦𝑖𝑡
∗< 3
3,
3 ≤𝑦𝑖𝑡
∗
. 
546 
For 𝑦𝑖
∗, the vector of latent responses of participant 𝑖, we formulate the linear model 
547 
𝑦𝑖
∗= 𝜇+ 𝑋𝑖𝛽+ 𝑍𝑖𝑏𝑖+ 𝜀𝑖, 
548 
where 𝜇 is the grand mean parameter, 𝑋𝑖 and 𝑍𝑖 are the 𝑖-th participant’s design matrices associated 
549 
with fixed effects and random effects, respectively, 𝛽 is the vector of fixed effects, 𝑏𝑖 is the vector of 
550 
random effects of participant 𝑖, and 𝜀𝑖 is the vector of error terms. Further, we assume 
551 
𝜀𝑖𝑡
∼𝒩(0, 𝜎𝜀𝑖)
𝜎𝜀𝑖
∼Lognormal(𝜇𝜎𝜀, 𝜎𝜎𝜀), 
552 
where 𝜎𝜀𝑖 is the residual error variance associated with participant 𝑖, and 𝜇𝜎𝜀 and 𝜎𝜎𝜀 are the 
553 
hyperparameters of the Lognormal distribution of residual error variances. For these hyperparameters, 
554 
we formulate the priors 
555 
𝜇𝜎𝜀
∼𝒩(0, 1
2)
𝜎𝜎𝜀
∼Gamma(4 ⋅log(2), 4),
 
556 
which put the majority of their mass on sensible values. For the vector of random effects , we assume 
557 

33 
 
𝑏𝑖
∼𝒩𝑘𝑏(0, 𝐷⋅𝑅⋅𝐷),
𝐷
= diag(𝜎𝑏1, . . . , 𝜎𝑏𝑘𝑏) 
558 
where 𝑘𝑏 is the number of random effects, 𝐷 is the diagonal matrix with the random effect standard 
559 
deviations 𝜎𝑏1, . . . , 𝜎𝑏𝑘𝑏 on the diagonal, and R is the correlation matrix of random effects. We further 
560 
formulate the weakly informative priors 
561 
𝜎𝑏1, . . . , 𝜎𝑏𝑘𝑏
∼Halfnormal(0,1),
𝑅
∼LKJ(2).
 
562 
Lastly, we formulate the following prior on the fixed effects, 
563 
𝜇
∼𝒩(0,3),
𝛽
𝜎‾𝜀
∼𝒩𝑘𝛽(0, 1
2 ⋅𝐼𝑘𝛽) ,
𝜎‾𝜀
= exp (𝜇𝜎𝜀+
𝜎𝜎𝜀
2
2 )
 
564 
where 𝑘𝛽 is the number of fixed effects, and 𝜎‾𝜀 is the theoretical mean of error standard deviations across 
565 
participants. Putting the prior on the ratio 
𝛽
𝜎‾𝜀 instead of 𝛽 allows us to formulate an appropriately 
566 
informed prior without prior knowledge of the average variance of the error term. We use the scaling 
567 
factor 
1
2 to represent our prior assumption that fixed effects are unlikely to be much larger (in absolute 
568 
value) than the average error standard deviation. 
569 
FMRI data analysis 
570 
We fitted hierarchical regression models to the BOLD response data extracted from the regions-of-
571 
interest. To account for the autocorrelation that is to be expected in fMRI data, we assumed that the 
572 
residual error terms within a run could be described by an autoregressive process of order 1 (AR(1)). 
573 
To facilitate interpretation and formulation of priors, we directly parameterized the model in terms of 
574 
contrasts of regression weights. For each subject 𝑖 and session 𝑗, we first build the raw design matrix 𝑋𝑖𝑗
𝑅 
575 
as is done in established software such as SPM (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, 
576 

34 
 
www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Shortly, for each separate type of event, we created a regressor representing 
577 
the expected BOLD signal induced by the event by convolving a boxcar function of appropriate onset and 
578 
length with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Then we constructed the design matrix in 
579 
terms of contrasts 𝑋𝑖𝑗
𝐶 by right-multiplying 𝑋𝑖𝑗
𝑅 with a matrix 𝐶 that encoded the contrasts of interest. For 
580 
example, consider the raw design matrix 𝑋𝑖𝑗
𝑅 of the empathy-for-pain paradigm with the following 
581 
mapping between column numbers and events: 
582 
1
↦Cue Self: No Pain
2
↦Cue Self: Pain
3
↦Cue Other: No Pain
4
↦Cue Other: Pain
5
↦Stimulus Self: No Pain
6
↦Stimulus Self: Pain
7
↦Stimulus Other: No Pain
8
↦Stimulus Other: Pain
9
↦Rating.
 
583

results in a matrix 𝑋𝑖𝑗

586

↦Cue Self: Mean
2
↦Cue Self: Pain - No Pain
3
↦Cue Other: Mean

↦Stimulus Other: Mean

↦Rating.
 
587 

35 
 
Finally, for tasks with two sessions (i.e. the empathy-for-pain task), main effects and interactions with the 
588 
session factor were represented by constructing the final first-level design matrix as the block matrix 
589 
𝑋𝑖= (𝑋𝑖1
𝑋𝑖2) = (𝑋𝑖1
𝐶
−𝑋𝑖1
𝐶
𝑋𝑖2
𝐶
𝑋𝑖2
𝐶). 
590 
With this construction, the first half of columns of 𝑋𝑖 correspond to the effects of events marginal to the 
591 
session factor, while the second half of columns correspond to the interactions between events and the 
592 
session factor. 
593 
For describing the hierarchical model, we denote the sequence of extracted signals of participant 𝑖 in 
594 
session 𝑗 as 𝑦𝑖𝑗. Further, we let 𝑡 index the timepoints within each such sequence, such that 𝑦𝑖𝑗=
595 
(𝑦𝑖𝑗1, 𝑦𝑖𝑗2, . . . , 𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑡, . . . )′. To account for low-frequency changes of signal of no interest (e.g., scanner drift), 
596 
each 𝑦𝑖𝑗 was first filtered with a high-pass filter of period 128. As differences in grand mean between 
597 
participants and sessions were not of interest, each sequence 𝑦𝑖𝑗 was mean centered to have mean 0. 
598 
Further, to change the arbitrary scale of BOLD response signals to a known scale, each 𝑦𝑖𝑗 was scaled to 
599 
have variance 1. The same operations were also performed on each design matrix 𝑋𝑖𝑗. 
600 
For each 𝑦𝑖𝑗, we formulate the linear model 
601 
𝑦𝑖𝑗= 𝑋𝑖𝑗⋅(𝛽+ 𝐺𝑖𝛾+ 𝑏𝑖) + 𝑢𝑖𝑗, 
602 
where 𝛽 is the vector of fixed effects of contrasts, 𝐺𝑖 is a variable that takes the value −1 when 
603 
participant 𝑖 is in the control group, and 1 when participant 𝑖 is in the experimental group, 𝛾 is the vector 
604 
of fixed effects of the factor group, 𝑏𝑖 is the vector of random effects of participant 𝑖, and 𝑢𝑖𝑗 is the vector 
605 
of error terms of participant 𝑖 in session 𝑗. We assume that 𝑢𝑖𝑗 follows an AR(1) process, thus 
606 
𝑢𝑖𝑗𝑡
= 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡+ 𝜑𝑖𝑗𝜀𝑖𝑗(𝑡−1),
𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡
∼𝒩(0, 𝜎𝜀𝑖𝑗),
 
607 
where 𝜑𝑖𝑗 is the autoregression parameter of person 𝑖 in session 𝑗, 𝜀𝑖𝑗𝑡 are independently and identically 
608 
distributed impulses, and 𝜎𝜀𝑖𝑗 is the standard deviation of these impulses for participant 𝑖 and session 𝑗. 
609 

36 
 
Following the hierarchical modeling approach, we assume that 𝜑𝑖𝑗 and 𝜎𝜀𝑖𝑗 are themselves drawn from 
610 
a higher-order distribution, for whose hyperparameters we formulate weak priors: 
611 
𝜑𝑖𝑗+ 1
2
∼Logitnormal(𝜇𝜑, 𝜎𝜑),
𝜇𝜑
∼𝒩(0,1),
𝜎𝜑
∼Halfnormal(0,1),
 
612 
and 
613 
𝜎𝜀𝑖𝑗
∼Lognormal(𝜇𝜎𝜀, 𝜎𝜎𝜀),
𝜇𝜎𝜀
∼𝒩(−1/2,1/2),
𝜎𝜎𝜀
∼Gamma(4 ⋅log(2), 4).
 
614 
For the vector of random effects , we assume 
615 
𝑏𝑖
∼𝒩𝑘𝑏(0, 𝐷⋅𝑅⋅𝐷),
𝐷
= diag(𝜎𝑏1, . . . , 𝜎𝑏𝑘𝑏) 
616 
where 𝑘𝑏 is the number of random effects, 𝐷 is the diagonal matrix with the random effect standard 
617 
deviations 𝜎𝑏1, . . . , 𝜎𝑏𝑘𝑏 on the diagonal, and R is the correlation matrix of random effects. We further 
618 
formulate the priors 
619 
𝑅
∼LKJ(2),
𝜎𝑏1, . . . , 𝜎𝑏𝑘𝑏
∼Halfnormal (0, 𝜎‾𝜀
2 ) ,
𝜎‾𝜀
= exp (𝜇𝜎𝜀+ 𝜎𝜎𝜀
2
2 ) ,
 
620 
where 𝜎‾𝜀 is the theoretical mean of error standard deviations across participants. This reflects the 
621 
assumption that random effects will not be much larger than the mean error standard deviation. Lastly, 
622 
we formulate the following priors on the fixed effects, 
623 
𝛽
𝜎‾𝜀
∼𝒩𝑘𝛽(0, 1
10 ⋅𝐼𝑘𝛽) ,
𝛾
𝜎‾𝜀
∼𝒩𝑘𝛾(0, 1
10 ⋅𝐼𝑘𝛾) ,
 
624 

37 
 
where 𝑘𝛽 and 𝑘𝛾 are the number of fixed effects. Putting the prior on the ratio 
𝛽
𝜎‾𝜀 instead of 𝛽 allows us 
625 
to formulate an appropriately informed prior without prior knowledge of the average variance of the 
626 
error term. We use the scaling factor 
1
10 to represent our prior assumption that fixed effects are likely to 
627 
be much smaller (in absolute value) than the average error standard deviation, due to the high amount 
628 
of noise in fMRI signal. However, as this prior formulation might still have been too vague for proper 
629 
hypothesis testing via the Bayes Factor, we additionally informed the prior with a fraction of 
2
𝑛 of the 
630 
likelihood of the data (where 𝑛 is the sample size), therefore calculating fractional Bayes factors (O’Hagan, 
631 
1995).

633 
Frequentist analyses: Behavioral data 
634 
As equivalent frequentist analyses of our behavioral data, we fitted linear mixed effects models to the 
635 
collected ratings. All Models were estimated using the R package lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al., 2017). P-
636 
values were derived using the Satterthwaite approximation of degrees of freedom. We used the 
637 
conventional significance level of α = 0.05, and one-sided testing for directional hypotheses. 
638 
Empathy for pain 
639 
To analyze the painfulness and unpleasantness ratings collected during the empathy-for-pain paradigm, 
640 
we modelled fixed effects for the experimental factors Group (non-violent vs. violent gaming, coded as -
641 
1 and 1), Time (pre vs. post gaming sessions, coded as -1 and 1), and Intensity (non-painful vs. painful 
642 
stimulation of the confederate, coded as -1 and 1), as well as all interactions between these factors. 
643 
Additionally, we modelled per-subject random effects of Time, Intensity, and these factors' interaction 
644 
term. Appendix 5 – table 1 presents the results of these analyses. For both ratings, we observed a non-
645 
significant Group*Session*Intensity interaction (for painfulness: onesided p-value = .080; for 
646 

38 
 
unpleasantness: onesided p-value = .381), implying no evidence for a VVG effect on behavioral correlates 
647 
of empathy for pain. 
648 
Appendix 5 – table 1. Linear mixed effects models for ratings in the empathy-for-pain task. Dependent variable: 
649 
empathy ratings (visual analog scale, range: 0 - 100). Factor codings: Group: control game group = -1, violent game 
650 
group = 1; Session: first session = -1, second session = 1; Intensity: non-painful = -1, painful = 1.  
651 
 
652 
Emotional reactivity 
653 
To analyze the unpleasantness ratings collected during the emotional reactivity paradigm, we modelled 
654 
fixed effects for the experimental factors Group (non-violent vs. violent gaming, coded as -1 and 1), 
655 
Content (neutral vs. violent, coded as -1 and 1), and Context (real vs. game, coded as -1 and 1). 
656 
Additionally, we modelled per-subject random effects for Content, Context, and their interaction. 
657 
Appendix 5 – table 2 presents the results of these analyses. We observed no significant Group*Content 
658 
interaction (one-sided p-value = .163) or Group*Content*Context interaction (one-sided p-value = .481), 
659 
implying no evidence for a VVG effect on behavioral correlates on emotional responses to violent images.

Frequentist analyses: FMRI data 
665 
We performed general-linear model (GLM) based whole-brain analysis using SPM12 (Wellcome Trust 
666 
Centre for Neuroimaging, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), implemented in MATLAB 2017b. Parameter 
667 
estimates were estimated on the first level, and the contrasts of interest were then subjected to two-
668 
sample t-tests on the second level. To increase power to detect effects in our a-priori defined regions of 
669 
interests (ROI), we used small-volume correction, using the same ROIs as for the bayesian analyses in the 
670 
main text. We tested for voxels that survived family-wise error correction, p < .05. To give a more 
671 
complete picture, we also tested for voxels inside the ROIs that survived the more lenient thresholds of p 
672 
< .001 uncorrected and p < .05 uncorrected. 
673 
Empathy for pain 
674 
For each participant and session, the first level design matrix included regressors for the Cue and 
675 
Stimulation events, separate for all four combinations of conditions (Self No Pain; Self Pain; Other No 
676 
Pain; Other Pain). As nuisance regressors, we included regressors for the rating events. We then subjected 
677

680 
Using family-wise error correction, we found no significant clusters in any of the three ROIs (AMCC, left 
681 
AI, right AI). There were also no voxels surviving the uncorrected threshold of p < .001. In left AI, one voxel 
682 
out of 343 survided the uncorrected threshold of p < 0.05.

Emotional reactivity 
684 
For each participant, the design matrix included regressors for the blocks of picture presentations, 
685 
separate for all four combinations of conditions (Neutral Real, Neutral Game, Violent Real, Violent Game). 
686 
As nuisance regressors, we included regressors for the rating events. We then subjected the beta images 
687

688 
contrast Control Group > Experimental Group was significant and positive.  
689 
For the interaction Group*Content (testing whether participants in the violent game group had decreased 
690 
responses to violent images in general), the contrast of interest was [Violent Real + Violent Game]/2 - 
691 
[Neutral Real + Neutral Game]/2. Using family-wise error correction, we found no significant clusters in 
692 
any of the two ROIs (left amygdala, right amygdala). There were also no voxels surviving the uncorrected 
693 
threshold of p < .001. In the left amygdala, 3 voxels out of 220 survided the uncorrected threshold of p < 
694 
0.05, and in the right amygdala, 10 voxels out of 248 survived this more lenient threshold. 
695 
For the interaction Group*Content*Context (testing whether participants in the violent game group had 
696 
decreased responses to specifically violent game images), the contrast of interest was [Violent Game - 
697

698 
clusters in any of the two ROIs (left amygdala, right amygdala). There were also no voxels surviving the 
699 
uncorrected threshold of p < .001. In the left amygdala, 15 voxels out of 220 survided the uncorrected 
700 
threshold of p < 0.05, and in the right amygdala, 49 voxels out of 248 survived this more lenient threshold.

Appendix 6 
702 
Covariate analyses 
703 
As described in our registration, we additionally performed analyses to investigate the role of trait 
704 
neuroticism and executive control on the possible violent video game (VVG) effect on empathy. As a 
705 
measure of trait neuroticism, we used the Neuroticism scale of the German version of the NEO-FFI 
706 
(Borkenau & Ostendorf, 1993). Due to technical issues, the neuroticism measure could not be obtained 
707 
from seven participants, leaving a sample size of N = 82 for these analyses. As a measure of executive 
708 
control, we used stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), measured with the software STOP-IT (Verbruggen et 
709 
al., 2008). Due to technical issues, valid SSRT measures of 8 participants were missing. Additionally, we 
710 
removed SSRT measures of 3 participants who inhibited responses in significantly more or less than 50% 
711 
of times (see (Verbruggen et al., 2008) for an explanation of this criterion). In total, the sample size for 
712 
analyses involving SSRT was N = 78. 
713 
We added the fixed effects of Neuroticism/SSRT, as well as its interactions with other factors, to the 
714 
models described in section Methods: Behavioral data analysis. Results are shown in Appendix 6 – table 
715 
1 for covariate Neuroticism, and in Appendix 6 – table 2 for covariate SSRT. The Bayes factor of the tests 
716 
of the interaction Neuroticism*Group*Intensity*Session was 0.265 for painfulness ratings, and 0.466 for 
717 
unpleasantness ratings. The Bayes factor of the tests of the interaction SSRT*Group*Intensity*Session 
718 
was 0.128 for painfulness ratings, and 0.021 for unpleasantness ratings. This indicates that behavioral 
719 
VVG effects could also not be observed in participants with high levels of trait neuroticism resp. high levels 
720 
of SSRT.  
721 
To analyze neural responses, we added the fixed effects of Neuroticism/SSRT, as well as its interactions 
722 
with other factors, to the models described in section Methods: fMRI analyses: empathy for pain. For 
723 
Other Cue events, the Bayes factors of the tests of the interaction Neuroticism*Group*Intensity*Session 
724 
were BFaMCC = 1.517; BFleft AI = 0.901; BFright AI = 0.703. For Other Stimulation events, the Bayes factors of 
725 

42 
 
the tests of the same interaction were BFaMCC = 0.348; BFleft AI = 0.226; BFright AI = 0.209. Thus, our data give 
726 
mixed levels of evidence for the absence of a modulation of VVG effects through trait neuroticism. For 
727 
Other Cue events, the data is inconclusive: we cannot confidently say that there is indeed no modulation 
728 
of the VVG effect on brain activity during cues that indicate whether or not the other person will receive 
729 
a painful stimulus. For Other Stimulation events, we obtain moderate evidence for the absence of such a 
730 
modulation: we can, with some confidence, say that participants with high neuroticism were not more 
731 
susceptible to VVG effects on brain activity while the other person received painful stimulation. 
732 
For Other Cue events, the Bayes factors of the tests of the interaction SSRT*Group*Intensity*Session were 
733 
BFaMCC = 0.087; BFleft AI = 0.126; BFright AI = 0.329. For Other Stimulation events, the Bayes factors of the tests 
734 
of the same interaction were BFaMCC = 0.936; BFleft AI = 0.316; BFright AI = 0.551. Thus, our data give mixed 
735 
levels of evidence for the absence of a modulation of VVG effects through executive control.  
736 
For Other Cue events, we obtain moderate to substantial evidence for the absence of such a modulation: 
737 
we can, with some confidence, say that participants with low executive control were not more susceptible 
738 
to VVG effects on brain activity during cues that indicate whether or not the other person will receive a 
739 
painful stimulus. For Other Cue events, the data is inconclusive: we cannot confidently say that there is 
740 
indeed no modulation of the VVG effect on brain activity while the other person received painful 
741 
stimulation.

Appendix 6 – table 2. Posterior parameter means of models for ratings in the empathy-for-pain task, including 
752 
the trait covariate SSRT (signal-stop reaction time). Dependent variable: empathy ratings (visual analog scale, 
753 
range: 0 - 100). Factor codings: Group: control game group = -1, violent game group = 1; Session: first session = -1, 
754 
second session = 1; Intensity: non-painful = -1, painful = 1. The variable SSRT was scaled to mean 0 and standard 
755 
deviation 1. Bayes Factors were derived from comparing a model where the respective parameter was unrestricted 
756 
to a model where it was restricted to zero. † These Bayes factors were derived from comparing a model where the 
757 
parameter was restricted to be negative to a model where it was restricted to zero (one-sided hypothesis test).
