Spectroscopy
Klaus Hentschel
Spectroscopic data, together with  scattering experiments, were probably the most
important experimental input to the development of  quantum theory and early
quantum mechanics. Not a discipline in its own right (see [6]), spectroscopy was
practiced within chemistry, optics and astrophysics and has a history extending far
back. Discontinuous features in the spectra of sunlight and from the ﬂames of vari-
ous substances were the subject of intense study throughout the nineteenth century.
As early as 1815, the Munich optician Joseph Fraunhofer (1787–1826) published
a detailed map of the solar spectrum exhibiting about 350 dark lines. He realized
these dark lines could serve as useful markers for speciﬁc colors in the otherwise
