Foreword
Audiology is a relatively new discipline and acoustics a well-established
branch of physics. Audiology and acoustics have widened their applications
over the years, and while acoustics has remained firmly based in physics,
audiology has, by its nature, become a paramedical discipline. One of the
effects of this is that a knowledge of acoustics is not seen as of primary
importance to many professionals in the field of audiology. The value of this
book is that it brings together the two areas of knowledge and demonstrates
how acoustics can be seen as a very important underpinning of audiology.
If one goes back to the early days of audiology in the United Kingdom,
which are well within the living memory of our more senior professionals,
there were no audiologists. There were physicists, engineers, medically
qualified people, and technical staff. The only people who had 'audiology' in
their titles were audiology technicians. Many science and engineering
graduates in those days would have undergone, in some part of their
training, lectures on acoustics. Today it is interesting to note that the
number of courses available at the graduate level in acoustics is very small
and the subject is not taught in most physics courses. My personal
experience, that confirms this situation to me, in teaching a module on
audiology in a medical physics course over a period of five years, is that not
one of the hundred or more honours graduates in physics had undertaken a
course containing any element of acoustics. In fact the majority of them did
not even know what a decibel was. It is therefore against this background
that one must welcome a book that can be read at levels ranging from a
nonmathematical introductory level to that of the science graduate dealing
with both the theory and practice of acoustics related to audiology.
A further underpinning of audiology, and indeed any science that involves
measurement, is the availability of standards. Standards take many forms
and range from codes of practice to dealing with fine technical details. One
of the main uses of standards is to ensure that measurements taken by an
individual in one place at a certain time can be replicated within given
tolerances in a different place at a different time. In audiology the relevant
standards relate to procedures for measurement, to the hardware required
to undertake the measurements, and to the environment in which the
measurements are taken. To complicate the issue, many of the standards
xiii

Foreword
involved have to be based on subjective measurements relating to defining
thresholds of hearing, as well as to the acoustical characteristics of the ear,
head, and torso. Standards are therefore vital to the good practice of
audiology and involve both acoustics and audiology to obtain meaningful
results. However, possibly because standards today are developed in an
international arena, namely, the ISO and IEC, and are contained within
committees that are largely concerned with acoustical matters, they are not
well known to many who practise audiology in spite of the fact that many
of their daily clinical measurements rely on the validity of these standards. It
is therefore very encouraging to see this rectified in this book, with a detailed
reference being made to appropriate standards and their most relevant
details described.
It might be a forlorn hope that the presence in the book of so many
references to standards would awaken an interest in this area vital to the
good practice of audiology. The current situation is that there is almost no
support for standardization work in the United Kingdom and elsewhere,
and the future of standards rests with a very small group, worldwide, of
dedicated people who produce the data required to upgrade existing
standards and to develop new ones. Peter Haughton rightly expresses in the
book his frustration with the inadequacies of existing standards. However,
the answer lies in the audiological profession and their employers giving a
much higher priority to standards development and ensuring that appro-
priate resources are provided to ensure that these developments take place.
The failure to develop standards does not lie with the standards organi-
zations but with the audiological profession for not ensuring that appropri-
ate support is made available.
Many advances in audiology today are related to the application of
acoustic technology. A knowledge of the fundamentals of acoustics is
essential if practitioners in audiology are going to understand the new
applications and maximize their use.
I hope that this book will become required reading for training courses
in audiology and related professions, as it brings together the relevance of
acoustics to audiology, which is not emphasized enough today.

Preface
This book is written for audiologists. The name has come to mean someone
who applies the methods of audiological science to the diagnosis of hearing
disorders and their treatment. An audiologist is, then, someone who works
directly with patients or clients. The book is therefore for audiologists in
hospitals, for those in hearing aid practice, and for clinicians who, though
well acquainted with the medical aspects of hearing, may wish to learn more
about the underlying physics. The text will also provide preparatory
material for those undertaking courses in audiological science.
Many who come to work in the medical or paramedical professions have
backgrounds in the biological rather than the physical sciences and, under-
standably, sometimes feel uncomfortable with physics itself and with the
mathematical formalism it involves. But like it or not, acoustics is thor-
oughly rooted in classical physics, and to understand the science of sound
it is necessary to have some appreciation of the physics. Fortunately, a little
learning goes a long way and most of this text will be understandable to
anyone who is familiar with those basic principles, particularly of mechanics,
that were taught in school but that may, perhaps, have been forgotten.
The same is true for much of the mathematics which is essential to an
appreciation of any of the physical sciences. It is amazing what can be done
with just elementary algebra and trigonometry, but the difficulty is that any
facility with mathematics requires not just logical thinking but also memory,
experience, and recent practice. For many readers the memory may be dim,
the experience forgotten, and the practice none too recent. For this reason
mathematical treatments have been kept to a reasonable minimum. What is
required, thoughâand here the reader must make due effortâis a full
understanding of mathematical notation, that is, of the symbolism and rules
of basic algebra. Mathematical notation provides, without ambiguity, the
most concise expression of the relationships between physical quantities,
and without it descriptions would become impossibly long-winded. With the
foregoing in mind, the first chapter starts with a review of the basic physics.
Some essential mathematics is included in Appendix A. Readers who have
purchased this book but who find the mathematical expressions unwelcome
should give particular attention to the introductory remarks in Chapter 1 if
they are not to be disappointed.

xvi Preface
There is, of course, far more to acoustics than the physics. The sciences
of anatomy and physiology describe the structure of the ear and attempt to
explain how it is that we hear, psychology or psychoacoustics deals with the
perception of sound, and medical science considers disorders of hearing and
their alleviation. The audiologist (as defined earlier) may have to contend
with all these aspects, or at least have some knowledge of them. This book,
however, will not stray far from the physics. There is some justification for
this because there are many good texts that deal with the nonphysical parts
of hearing science but few that treat physical acoustics at an appropriate
level. It is the author's hope, therefore, that the reader will find in these
chapters something helpful which is not readily obtainable elsewhere. It may
seem curious that a book written for audiologists has only a short chapter
on hearing aids. However, a recent Internet search of books about hearing
aids provided a list of 104 titles. Many of these works were written by
experts in the hearing aid industry, and an attempt to add to this literature
would seem almost presumptuous. The reader will be better served by
consulting current publications, particularly because the technology is
changing almost daily as we enter the digital era.
Questions and exercises have been included at the end of each chapter
(except the first). Their order corresponds approximately to that of the
subjects as they appear in the main text. Students will find that working
through the questions will impart a familiarity with the physics and
generally make it easier to understand the ground that is being covered.
Many of the questions include numerical exercises. Although they may seem
challenging at first sight, the exercises usually require little more than
substitution of numerical information into the formulae given in the text.
Attention to the exercises will enhance the student's arithmetical skill and
help him or her to remember the meaning of the symbols and the technical
terms and their relationship to each other. Diligence is essentialâvery little
can be learnt without practice.
Unless they are fortunate enough to have worked abroad, authors of
technical works tend to write for their own countrymen. The choice of
subjects treated in this book has to some extent been determined by the
syllabuses of courses run in Britain for audiology technicians, for industrial
audiometricians, and for hearing aid dispensers whose practice is regulated
by statute under the Hearing Aid Council Act. The range is, however, wider
than such courses require, and the treatment is for the most part more
thorough. The physics is, of course, universal. The text should therefore be
as relevant to audiological practice beyond these shores as it is to those on
home ground.

The help and encouragement I received from colleagues while writing this
book is gratefully acknowledged. I particularly wish to thank Michael
Spicer, Head of Bioengineering, for his painstaking reading of the text and
for the many helpful suggestions that he offered along the way. Michael
spent many hours in this task and but for his patient help there would be
many more errors than those which inevitably remain. I also thank Richard
Stubbs for the many lively discussions of technical issues and for his
assistance in producing the computer-generated facsimile of Newton's rings
in Figure 3.8.
Most of the illustrations in this book are original, but some have been
taken directly from other publications or adapted to suit the needs of this
text. I wish to record my gratitude to those who have generously allowed me
to use their work. I also thank my colleague Tracy Kemp for creating the
free-hand drawings in Figures 3.1, 3.20, and 3.21; and Rob Walker, Rachel
Quaranta, and Colin Parker of the mechanical workshop and medical
illustration department for their help with technical drawings, photographs,
and various other illustrations.

The Basics
This book is about the physics of sound: how it is produced, how it is
propagated, how it can be measured, and so on. We should therefore start
by reminding ourselves of some of the basic principles of physics, making
special reference to those principles which are directly relevant to the science
of acoustics. This first chapter provides a brief, highly selective review of
elementary science and, in particular, elementary mechanics and properties
of matter. Although these things are of course taught at school, they are
often forgotten or only partially remembered after our school days are over.
This chapter moves quite rapidly from one topic to the next and does not
attempt to provide much in the way of explanation. It should be treated
rather like a glossary except that the material is presented in a logical rather
than an alphabetical order. The intention is not so much to teach the
physics as to explain terms that occur later in the text. Readers who have
difficulty with elementary physics are advised that further reading should be
considered.
It will be apparent from the outset that mathematical notation is used
more widely in this book than in the introductory material found in other
basic audiology textbooks. It is worth repeating the statement in the preface
that mathematical notation provides a concise and unambiguous expression
of the relationships between physical quantities and, providing it is under-
stood, it can be a valuable complement to ordinary language. The great
difficulty here is that many aspiring audiologists have little knowledge of
mathematics (they probably detested it in their school days) and no ability
to manipulate algebraic expressions. For them mathematics is an anathema.
Their interest in audiology is not so much in the physics or even the
acoustics as perhaps in the medical aspects and in the rewards of providing
a personal service to another human being in need of help. But most courses
in audiology and most examinations essential to the acquisition of profes-
sional qualifications do require at least some understanding of acoustics, in
which physics and mathematics are virtually indispensable. So what is to be
done? There are two things that should encourage the mathematically
diffident reader. The first is that although mathematical expressions will be
used freely throughout the book, it will not be a disaster if they are not all
understood. Wherever possible the ordinary text stands on its own so that
1

2 Acoustics for Audiologists
it is intelligible even if equations and other expressions are not meaningful.
The second thing is that the mathematics is used only for its illustrative
value and not as a means to derive one expression from another. Statements
such as 'it can be shown...' may be taken to mean just that. There are
inevitably some areas in which mathematical notation and mathematical
ideas do have to be understood. The sine function, for example, is so
important to acoustics that it is essential to know what this function is, to
fully understand its principal characteristics, and to appreciate its relation-
ship to other trigonometic functions. Appendix A should help, and there are
many textbooks that can supply this information.
Physics is a difficult subject, and acoustics, which is part of physics, is not
particularly easy. It is important to recognize where the difficulty lies
because it is not only in the mathematical content. Physics is not all about
the discovery of 'scientific facts'; it is about ideas, about the explanation of
one observation in terms of another, and about a quest for ever greater
generalization. Many of the ideas â the so-called lawsâhave taken centu-
ries to develop and have exercised the minds of some of the most able
thinkers of all time. We should not be surprised if they are at times difficult
to comprehend. But for the most part the physics in this book is straight-
forward and should be within the grasp of any intelligent person. There are
really two difficulties. The first is that physics relies on very precise
statements in which ordinary words are given narrowly defined, special
meanings which they do not generally have in an everyday context.
Familiarity with the special meanings is essential. The other difficulty is that
almost any discourse requires a knowledge of many facts that the reader
may be unaware of, and introduces as the argument proceeds many
statements that have to be recalled. These are difficulties that can be
overcome only through perseverance.
Moving Bodies
The title of this section may sound like an advertisement for the mortician,
so it would be as well to explain what is meant here by a body. In dynamics,
the term denotes any distinct object which moves or is capable of being
moved as a whole. There is no restriction on size: a body can be anything
from a star to a grain of sand and can comprise any material substance, real
or imaginary. The ordinary (nonrotational) motion of such a body can be
described by that of a specified point within the body, its centre of mass, for
example, and in elementary dynamics bodies are often treated as though
they existed at a single point. The orbit of Jupiter, for example, can be
described in terms of the relative motion of two point-masses, the sun and
the planet. A point is, of course, a mathematical abstraction, but when we

The Basics 3
draw diagrams to represent the movement of some object we are usually
content with this abstract representation and perhaps even unaware of it. It
is an obvious and necessary simplification.
The rate at which a body moves is called its velocity. To describe velocity
completely, it is necessary to know both its magnitude (how many metres per
second) and its direction. Quantities whose description includes a magnitude
and a direction are called vectors. Velocity and its cousin, acceleration, are
vectors. The term speed is sometimes used to denote the magnitude part of a
velocity, but there is no need to be pedantic about this. It is usually obvious
from the context whether a complete or partial specification is needed, and it
would not be a cardinal sin to describe the velocity of sound as, say, 340 m/s
while omitting to specify the direction of propagation.
If a body is moving with constant velocity in a straight line, the distance
moved in a given time is obviously the product of the velocity and the time.
So if a body has a constant velocity M, the distance moved in time t is ut,
which is the area of the rectangle in Figure 1.1 a. The rate of change of
velocity is called acceleration. Note that acceleration may involve a change
in speed or direction or both. When a body is forced to move in a circle, for
example, it has an acceleration towards the centre of the circle by virtue of
the changing direction needed to maintain the circular path even though its
speed along the circumference may be constant. If a body moves in a
straight line with constant acceleration, its velocity increases at a steady rate.
If a body, initially at rest, undergoes an acceleration a, its velocity v at time
t will be at. The distance it has moved in this time is jvt, which equals ?at2,
the area of the triangle in Figure l.lb. One way of looking at this is to say
that the average velocity during the interval 0 to t is $y and that the distance
moved must be the average velocity multiplied by the time. This is fair
enough when the acceleration is constant, but more generally it may be said
that whether the acceleration is constant or not, the distance moved in the
interval from time t1 to t2 is the area beneath the velocity-time curve during
the interval. This is illustrated in Figure l.lc. Finally, we see from the
foregoing that the following formulae apply if a body starts at rest and
moves in a straight line with constant acceleration:
and
where a is the acceleration, v is the velocity, and s is the distance moved
after time t. Therefore,
and

acceleration.
Mass
The mass of a body is often said to be 'the quantity of matter' it contains,
but this begs the question as to how such a quantity might be recognized.
Mass shows itself in two ways: inertia and gravity. Inertia is apparent in the
effort needed to change the velocity of a body, and gravity is a universal
attraction which exists between all material objects. The weight of a body is
the gravitational force between it and the earth. For any two bodies,
4 Acoustics for Audiologists

The Basics 5
regardless of substance, the ratio of their masses m1/m2 is identical to the
ratio of their weights w1/w2. This equivalence of inertial and gravitational
mass has been verified experimentally with great precision and is one of the
fundamental tenets of the general theory of relativity. The unit of mass is
that of the standard kilogram, and the mass of other objects can be
determined by comparing their weights with that of the standard.
The gravitational force F between two bodies is described by Newton's
formula:
where m1 and w2 are the masses of the bodies and d is the distance between
them. The gravitational constant G is a universal constant that depends only
on the units of measurement and not on the material of which the bodies
may be composed. Though surpassed by Einstein's theory of relativity, this
beautiful and simple law holds true on almost all scales from the near-
atomic to the cosmic. Gravity is not the only interaction between matter,
however; over very short distances, intermolecular and interatomic forces
dominate. The d in Equation 1.2 is never quite zero, and F is never infinite.
Centre of Mass (Centre of Gravity)
Matter is not, of course, concentrated at a point but is distributed within
and among the material bodies in any chosen region. For any aggregation
of matter there is a point called the centre of mass, and in a uniform
gravitational field this is also the centre of gravity. The simplest definition of
the centre of gravity of a body is to say that it is the point at which the
weight of the body acts. This means that if the body is freely suspended in
any way whatsoever, its centre of gravity will always be directly below the
point of suspension. The centre of gravity is also the point about which the
weight of the body is perfectly balanced.
We can, however, think about the centre of mass in a more fundamental
way. Any collection of matter can be imagined to consist of an indefinite

from some arbitrary fixed point. Suppose we square these distances and
multiply each by its respective mass and then add the results to form the
sum S, that is,
The sum will depend on the position of the point from which the distances
have been measured. The centre of mass is that position for which S has the

least possible value. In statistics we are used to the idea that the sum of the
squares of a set of values is a minimum when the values are measured
relative to the mean. One can think of the centre of mass as a point which
represents the mean position of the masses under consideration where the
mean is statistically weighted (no pun intended) according to mass. The
positions of the individual masses can be described by their coordinates x,
y, and z in some arbitrary frame of reference. The coordinates of the centre
of mass are therefore the following weighted means:
Momentum
The product of mass and velocity, mv, is called momentum. Because velocity
is involved (and because mass is obviously nondirectional, that is, scalar),
momentum is a vector whose direction is the same as that of the velocity.
The truly important thing about momentum is that it is conserved; that is,
within any closed system the total momentum in any specified direction is
constant. This principle is a valuable aid to calculations in dynamics. Here
is an example. Consider a 'system' comprising just two bodies of masses mt
and m2 and suppose that they are moving towards each other along the
same straight path with velocities v1 and â v2, respectively. They will collide.
Suppose the bodies are made of soft inelastic material such as putty so that
on collision they coalesce to become a single body of mass (m1 + m2)
moving at velocity v. We can calculate v by applying the principle that the
momentum is conserved. Before the collision it was m1v1 â m2v2, and
afterwards it became (ml + m2)u, and since these must be equal so as to
keep the momentum unchanged, we can write
Therefore
Force and the Laws of Motion
Newton's law of gravitation, his theory of dynamics, and his explanation of
the motion of celestial bodies together constitute one of the greatest

The Basics 7
achievements of the human mind. We are nowadays so familiar with these
ideas that we often overlook their wonderful simplicity and near-universal
application. Newton established three laws â the so-called laws of
motionâwhich are the bedrock of classical mechanics. They may be stated
as follows:
1. A body remains at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless
acted on by a force.
2. The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the force
acting on it and takes place in the direction of the force.
3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
The first law is a definition of force; the corollary is that a force is that
which changes, or tends to change, the state of rest of a body or its uniform
motion in a straight line. When the mass of a body is constant (as it usually
is), the rate of change of momentum is simply the mass times rate of change
of velocity, that is, mass times acceleration. The second law can therefore be
paraphrased as The force is proportional to the mass of the body multiplied
by its acceleration'. In the third law, 'action' means 'force' or the act of
applying a force. It is never possible to create a force without also creating
a force of equal strength acting in the opposite direction. When bodies
collide, each is subject to the same force acting in opposing directions; if you
fire a gun, the force that drives the bullet is equal and opposite to the recoil.
It is impossible to move the centre of mass of any closed system by any
action occurring entirely within it.
The first law gives a qualitative definition of force, and the second law
provides a way of defining the unit of measurement in terms of the
acceleration imparted to a body of unit mass. A force of 1 newton is that
force needed to produce an acceleration of 1 ms~2 when acting on a mass
of 1 kg. Within any consistent set of units, we can say that 'force equals mass
times acceleration' and write this symbolically as
Philosophers have objected to the concept of force as an agent which
brings about a change in the motion of a body or which, in gravitation,
facilitates action at a distance. Matter accelerates towards other matter at a
rate inversely proportional to the square of the separation, and to say that
this is the action of a force does not, it is claimed, add new knowledge or
provide a meaningful explanation. The idea of a force is superfluous, and
Newton's equations can be written without involving it. But force is an
extremely helpful intermediary whose use pervades the whole of science and
engineering. It gives us a sense of what is happening and helps our
understanding of everyday events.

Work and Energy
It may be the curse of the drinking classes, but in physics work means the
product of force and the distance an object moves during the action of that
force. As already stated, force is a vector and distance is also, for it clearly
has direction as part of its identity. Thus, work is the product of two vectors.
When vectors are multiplied the result can be another vector or it can be
scalar, according to which definition is chosen (see Appendix A). Work is
defined as scalar, that is, without direction. This means that the force and
the distance moved must be in the same direction. If the force is in some
other direction, then its component in the direction of the movement must
be considered in reckoning the work done.
Work is measured in joules, 1 joule being the work done when a body
moves 1 metre during the action of a force of 1 newton.
Work is said to be done by some entity on some other entity, and as a
result the former is said to lose energy while the latter is said to gain it.
Within any isolated system the losses and gains are always equal so that the
total energy1 of the system remains constant whatever is happening within
it. The principle of the conservation of energy is one of the most important
and enduring in science and has never been shown to fail. It is often said
that energy can take many formsâmechanical, electrical, chemical, ther-
mal, internal, and so on. This is certainly true, but all forms are in one or
other of two categories: potential and kinetic. Potential energy is energy that
a body or system has as a consequence of its state or configuration; kinetic
energy is energy due to movement. We will consider kinetic energy first.
A body can move in one or both of two ways: it can move along a line
(translational motion) or it can rotate. In translational motion under the
action of a constant force F, a body of mass m will have an acceleration
equal to F/m. If it starts at rest, the distance s that it moves before acquiring
a velocity v is given by Equation 1.1 as
so that
But Fs is the product of the force responsible for the acceleration and the
distance moved during the action of that force, that is to say, the work done
on the body in order to give it the velocity, v. The kinetic energy Ek acquired
by the body is equal to the work done on it. Therefore the kinetic energy of
JThe energy includes that associated with mass-energy transformations in accordance with the
theory of relativity.

The Basics 9
a body moving with velocity v is given by
The kinetic energy associated with rotation will not be considered here
except to say that it can be expressed in a similar way, but instead of velocity
and mass we find angular velocity and a quantity called the moment of
inertia.
Potential energy has many varieties, but in all these it is energy that is
stored after work has been done to cause some change in whatever it is that
holds the stored energy. Two examples follow.
Example 1: Potential Energy due to Gravity in a Uniform
Gravitational Field
The force on a body due to the earth's gravity is its weight; we will digress
briefly to say what this means. There are two ways of thinking about weight.
If a body is allowed to fall, it does so with an acceleration g (approximately
9-81 ms~2). We can say that gravity exerts a force W equal to the mass of
the body times its acceleration; that is, W = mg. We should therefore call g
the 'acceleration due to gravity'. Alternatively, we can think of the earth as
the cause of a gravitational field (which indeed it is). The intensity of a field
is the force it exerts on unit 'something', so for a gravitational field it is unit
mass, for an electric field it is unit electric charge, and so on. The constant
g can therefore be called the 'gravitational intensity'. So we measure g in
ms~2 or in Nkg-1; it makes no difference. In most everyday events, objects
when they move do so close to the earth's surface; that is, they are usually
at distances from the surface that are minute compared with the earth's
radius. Accordingly, their weight remains almost constant. Indeed, unless
objects are taken into space the loss of weight with increasing height is
difficult to detect. This means that when something is lifted, the work done
on it is equal to a constant force (its weight) multiplied by the distance
raised. The potential energy Ep of a body raised to a height h above the
ground is therefore
The potential energy Ep is equal to the kinetic energy that the body has the
potential to acquire if it falls freely through a distance h.
It may be noticed that the earth's surface is a quite arbitrary datum from
which to measure the height. There is, in fact, no absolute reference, and the
potential energy in the preceding expression is the potential relative to that

10 Acoustics for Audiologists
at the ground. Potential energy can only be expressed in relative terms, and
in applying the concept it is the change in potential that matters. The same
is true for kinetic energy because velocity is also relative, but for most
purposes we think of velocity as being relative to that of the earth; that is,
we regard objects as stationary if they are motionless relative to our
ordinary terrestrial reference.
Example 2: Potential Energy and Elasticity
Elasticity will be considered later in this chapter because it is particularly
important in the context of mechanical vibrations and acoustic phenomena.
The point to be made here is that if work is done in changing the shape of
an object, the change, if it is reversible, is a source of potential energy. The
difference between this potential and the gravitational potential described in
the previous example is that the force which causes the change in shape is
not constant. The potential energy is the area under the force-displacement
curve, where displacement means the distance moved at the point where the
force is applied. In a simple linear elastic system, the force increases (or
decreases) in proportion to the displacement. If additionally the force is
zero when the displacement is zero, we can express this symbolically as
F = sx, where 5 is a constant called stiffness and x is the displacement (see
Figure 1.2). The work done in establishing the displacement is therefore jFx,
and the corresponding potential energy is
or
The quantity 1/s is called compliance.
Transformation of Energy Between
Various Forms
Nearly all physical events lead to energy transformations from one form to
another. Imagine, for example, a stone falling into a pond. Its initial
gravitational energy becomes kinetic energy, but this is soon transferred to
the water, where it is .transported in the ripples as kinetic energy of the
moving water and potential energy associated with changes in the height of
the water surface (gravitational) and the shape of the surface (elastic because

FIG. 1.2 Linear elastic system: the variation of force with extension of a simple
spring.
of surface tension). But the ripples spread out and eventually disappear, so
where has the energy gone? The answer is that it has been converted into
heat, which ultimately contributes to the internal energy of the pond, its
surroundings, and so on indefinitely. Internal energy can be thought of at a
microscopic level as the kinetic and potential energies of the particles which
make up matter, that is, the energies of the molecules, atoms, and subatomic
particles themselves. The movement of these particles is haphazard. The
local order associated with the presence of the stone at a known point above
the pond has become disorder; the total energy of the universe has not
changed, but its state has become more chaotic.
Power
The rate at which work is done is called power. Power is measured in watts,
1 watt being a rate of working of 1 joule per second. Although the origin of
this definition is mechanical, the idea applies in situations where the source
of energy is not directly mechanical. For example, a chemical reaction
generates energy in the form of heat and light. The rate at which this energy
is produced is of course measurable in watts. Similarly, the electromagnetic
radiation from, say, a radio transmitter can be expressed in watts. Power is
particularly important in acoustics as an expression of the acoustic energy
emanating from a source, and many acoustic quantities, such as sound level,
are directly related to it.

12 Acoustics for Audiologists
Electrical Current, Potential
Difference, Resistance, and Power
Electricity is, in its own right, an important part of physics, but it is also
relevant to acoustics for several reasons. As concerns theory, some methods
in acoustics have their direct counterparts or even their origins in the theory
of electrical circuits and transmission systems. Acoustic equipment often
includes electroacoustic transducers, such as microphones and speakers,
which have electrical components; and electronic amplifiers are an integral
part of acoustic instruments, sound reproduction equipment, and acoustic
amplifiers, including, of course, hearing aids. Although the terms used in
describing electrical processes are well known, students may not be familiar
with their precise definitions which, accordingly, are given in this section.
The unit of electric current, the ampere, is a fundamental unit (a 'base'
unit) in the International System of Units (SI). The ampere is defined
through its magnetic effect. The official definition is given below without
explanation:
The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight
parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and
placed 1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a
force equal to 2 x 10~7 MKS unit of force (newton) per metre of length.
The unit of electric charge (quantity of electricity) is the coulomb. It is the
charge carried by a current of 1 ampere flowing for 1 second. If electric
charge is taken from one point in a circuit to another, work must be done
to overcome the resistance of the conductors and the influence of any
electric or magnetic fields. The electric potential difference between the
points is said to be 1 volt if 1 joule of work is required for each coulomb
carried. When a steady current flows in a conductor, the potential difference
between two points on the conductor is directly proportional to the current.
This is Ohm's law. The constant of proportionality is called resistance, and
the unit of resistance, the ohm, is defined such that a potential difference of
1 volt leads to a current of 1 ampere if the resistance is 1 ohm. Ohm's law
can be expressed symbolically as
where / is the current, V the potential difference, and R the resistance.
It follows from these definitions that the power W dissipated (as heat) in
an electrical resistance is given by the following:

The Basics 13
or
or
It should be noted that electrical potential is not potential energy as such,
but the potential energy per unit charge, that is, energy in joules per
coulomb. Notice also that power involves the square of the voltage or the
current. The correspondence with expressions of acoustic power will become
apparent later.
Electrical Capacitance and Inductance
Circuit components capable of storing electric charge are called condensers
or capacitors. Their electrical capacitance is a measure of their ability to
store charge. A capacitor usually has two terminals. The stored charge is
proportional to the capacitance and to the potential difference (the voltage)
between the terminals. The unit of capacitance is the farad (symbol F).
It is equal to the number of coulombs of charge stored for the application
of 1 volt. The stored charge Q coulombs is therefore given by
where C is the capacitance in farads and V is the voltage difference between
the terminals.
The potential energy stored in a capacitor is equal to the work that has
to be done to charge it. This energy is equal to 1CV2. Note the similarity
between this expression and the corresponding expression for the mechan-
ical energy stored in an elastic system (Equation 1.4b). Voltage corresponds
to force, and capacitance to 1/s, the reciprocal of mechanical stiffness. We
shall refer to this similarity again in Chapter 7 when discussing the various
forms of impedance.
When an electric current flows in a conductor, it creates a magnetic field.
If a loop or coil of wire is placed in a changing magnetic field, it is found
that a voltage appears that causes current to flow in the wire. If, therefore,
a coil of wire is connected to a nonsteady electrical supply that causes the
current in the coil to change, an electrical potential difference will be
developed across the ends of the coil by virtue of the changing magnetic field
that it is itself producing. The phenomenon is called self-inductance, and the
induced potential difference e opposes the change in current. For this reason
the potential difference is known as a back emf (emf means electromotive

14 Acoustics for Audiologists
force). The emf is proportional to the rate of change of the current, so that
we can write
where L is a constant called the inductance of the coil. The minus sign
reminds us that the emf opposes the change in the current. Inductance is
measured in henries (symbol H). A back emf of 1 volt is generated by a
current changing at 1 ampere per second when the inductance is 1 henry.
If a current / is established in a coil of wire, work has to be done to create
the associated magnetic field. The energy stored in the magnetic field is
equal to 1LI2. Note the similarity between this expression and the one for
kinetic energy (Equation 1.3). Inductance L is analogous to mass, and
current is analogous to velocity.
Density and Specific Gravity
The density of a substance tells us how much of it, in terms of its mass, is
contained in a given volume. Density is therefore defined as mass per unit
volume and expressed in kg m~3. A lowercase Greek rho is often used to
denote density, so if the mass m of a substance occupies a volume V, we can
write the density as
It is sometimes convenient to express density relative to the density of
pure water (1000 kg m~3). Density expressed in this way is called specific
gravity. For example, the specific gravity of the acid in a car battery is about
1-25, meaning that the density of the acid is 1-25 times the density of water,
that is, 1-25 x 1000 kg m~3). A brewer may give the 'original gravity' of his
wort as '1038', omitting the decimal point and meaning that the specific
gravity of the liquor is 1-038.
Pressure
For a force distributed over a surface, pressure is defined as force per unit
area of the surface. In the SI system, pressure is measured in newtons per
square metre (N m~2) or pascals (Pa). The pascal is the name given to a
unit of pressure equal to 1 newton per square metre.
Force is a vector, and in defining pressure, the force is that which is
directed at right angles (normal) to the surface. Pressure might therefore be

The Basics 15
regarded as a vector, but at any point in a fluid (liquid and gas) it is found
to have the same value in all directions, so that it is, in effect, scalar. This
does not, of course, mean that pressure has the same value (magnitude) at
all places in a fluid. In general, pressure does vary from one place to another;
the variation with distance in a given direction is called the pressure
gradient, which clearly is a vector.
Variation of Pressure with Depth in a Liquid
Suppose a liquid of density p is contained in a cylinder having a cross-
sectional area S. Consider the liquid above a horizontal plane at depth h
(Figure 1.3). The volume of the liquid is hS and its weight is therefore pghS.
This weight is the force distributed over the cross section of the container,
and since this section has an area S, the pressure in the liquid at the depth
h is given by
This formula gives the pressure at the base of a column of liquid of height
h. Pressure is often expressed in terms of the height of an equivalent column
of water or mercury. It may be noticed that Equation 1.6 makes no reference
to atmospheric pressure and therefore gives pressure relative to atmospheric
pressure; that is, it gives the amount by which the pressure at depth h
exceeds the pressure in the surrounding air. There are many circumstances
when this is appropriate. For example, a patient's blood pressure is
important, not in absolute terms, but as a pressure relative to atmospheric
pressure. Similarly, the pressure in the middle ear as measured by tympa-
nometry is best expressed in relative terms because this gives directly the
pressure difference across the tympanic membrane. On the other hand, if air
FIG. 1.3 Hydrostatic pressure within a column of liquid.

16 Acoustics for Audiologists
pressure were needed in order to determine the density of the air, the
absolute rather than the relative measure would be required.
Referring again to the measurement of middle ear pressure, modern
equipment usually expresses the result in decapascals (daPa), whereas older
equipment used millimetres of water. The density of water is 1000 kg m~3,
and the gravitational intensity has already been given as 9-81 ms~2.
Therefore the pressure in a column of water whose height is 1 mm is
1000 x 9-81 x 10~3 = 9-81 Pa or 0-981 daPa. So for practical (audiological)
purposes the two units are equivalent.
Elasticity
The ability of a body to recover its size and shape after being deformed is
called elasticity; a perfectly elastic body is one in which the recovery is
complete. Failure to recover size and shape is called plasticity, and a
perfectly plastic body is one in which the deformation is permanent. Most
materials are neither perfectly elastic nor perfectly plastic, but many ap-
proach these limits quite closely. Spring steel, for example, is almost
perfectly elastic if the deformation is small; the elastic compression of air,
essential to the transmission of airborne sound, is perfectly reversible, but
liquid/solid composites such as putty can be almost perfectly plastic.
The changes in shape and size of a body when forces are applied to it
depend on the nature of the forces and the material of which the body is
composed. It will be assumed that the material is homogeneous (same
composition throughout) and isotropic (same elastic properties in all
directions). Its properties can be specified in terms of a number of constants,
namely, the elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio. A modulus is the ratio of
stress to strain. Stress (like pressure) is a force per unit area, and strain is a
measure of the relative change in size or shape that the stress produces.
Strain is always dimensionless because it is the ratio of two like quantities,
such as change in length or volume divided by the original length or volume.
A modulus therefore has the same units as those of stress (Nm~2). The type
of modulus depends on the way that the stress is applied and the nature of
the strain to be accounted for.
Any deformation can be accomplished in two steps: a change in size
(volume) without a change in shape, followed or preceded by a change in
shape without a change in size. The two elastic moduli related to these
changes are therefore particularly important. We will, however, start with
the tensile modulus because this is easily visualized and it provides a useful
introduction to the terminology.

The Basics 17
Tensile Modulus (Young's Modulus)
A tensile force is one which stretches a body in a specified direction;
tensile stress is tensile force per unit area, where the area is in a surface
at right angles to the direction of the force. Tensile strain is the in-
crease in length per unit length of the body in the direction of the stress.
Figure 1.4 shows a wire whose unstretched length is l and whose cross-
sectional area is 5. The application of the force F causes the length
to increase to l'. The increase in length is therefore l' â l, and the tensile
strain is (l' â l)/l. The tensile modulus (also known as Young's modulus) is
defined as
This definition can be expanded to include the case where the tensile
force is reversed, making it compressive and making the strain a rela-
tive decrease in length. Nevertheless, Young's modulus is applicable
only to the analysis of the elastic behaviour of solids because liquids and
gases need containment, which creates lateral forces in addition to the axial
force F.
As the wire is stretched, the increase in volume due to the elongation is
partly compensated by a small reduction in diameterâthe wire becomes
longer and thinner. The reduction in diameter is a strain in a radial
direction. The ratio of this strain to the axial strain is called Poisson's ratio
(symbol a). For hard materials such as steel its value is typically between
0-2 and 0-3; for soft materials such as rubber it approaches, but is always
less than, 0-5.
FIG. 1.4 Young's modulus: the ratio of tensile stress to tensile strain.

18 Acoustics for Audiologists
Bulk Modulus
The bulk modulus is used to specify the decrease in volume that occurs under
the action of a uniform pressure. The volume strain is the decrease in volume
of the body, divided by the original volume. It expresses a change in size
without a change in shape. The bulk modulus, K, is the ratio of the stress to
the strain. Accordingly,
The bulk modulus exists for solids, liquids, and gases. In solids the stress
can be directed outwards (in effect a negative pressure) with a corresponding
reversal of the strain, but liquids and gases cannot normally exist unless
contained by a positive pressure. For these states the compressive stress that
defines the modulus is a stress added to the preexisting pressure. The bulk
modulus is particularly important in acoustics because it is one of the factors
that determine the velocity of sound and other important acoustic quanti-
ties. (See also the section Bulk Modulus of a Gas, later in this chapter.)
Modulus of Rigidity
Rigidity means, somewhat loosely, the tendency of an elastic body to resist
deformation under the action of external forces. In the context of the
modulus of rigidity, it refers specifically to a type of strain called a shear. This
strain is a change in shape without a change in volume. Shear is produced
by a force acting tangentially (parallel) to a surface; the shear stress is the
tangential force per unit area of the surface. Deformation in shear is
illustrated in Figure 1.5. It may be imagined as the progressive displacement
of successive slices of the material parallel to the direction of the applied
force. Suppose two planes ('slices') are separated by a distance h and that
the shear produces a relative movement of material in these planes through
a distance x. The shear strain is defined as x/h. If x is small, this ratio is
equal to the angle 9 shown in the diagram.2 The modulus of rigidity n is
defined as
In solids the modulus of rigidity is typically 0-3 to 0-5 times the bulk
modulus; in fluids (liquids and gases) it is zero.
2The angle 6 is measured in radians. See Appendix A.

The Basics 19
FIG. 1.5 Modulus of rigidity: the ratio of shear stress to shear strain. Stress =
F/S; strain = x/h = B; modulus = n; n = (F/S) -=- (x/h).
Because any deformation can be accomplished by combining a change in
size and change in shape, the elastic constants are related. It can be shown,
for example, that
Potential Energy
Expressed in terms of stress and strain, the elastic potential energy is the
elastic energy per unit volume of the deformed material (J m~3).
(Compare Equation 1.4.)
It may be noted that potential energy is proportional to the square of the
stress or the strain; we will see later that acoustic energies are similarly
proportional to the squares of such terms. Because the shear modulus is zero
in liquids and gases, the elastic energy in these materials comes only from
compressive (or expansive) strains and, anticipating later parts of this text,
it may be expected that vibrations can be propagated as sound waves only

20 Acoustics for Audiologists
if they are associated with compression or expansion, that is, if the
vibrations are in the direction of propagation. In solids, however, transverse
modes involving shear are also possible. For example, the vibrations of
chime bars and tuning forks are in effect transverse waves associated with
bending and governed principally by Young's modulus, which is related to
both shear and bulk elasticity.
Viscosity
Although fluids are not elastic in shear, the movement of one layer of a fluid
relative to an adjacent layer is not unhindered. The tangential force created
by such movement is proportional, not to the shear strain itself, but to the
rate at which the shear is occurring. The rate of shear is the rate of change
of velocity with distance, that is, the velocity gradient in a direction
perpendicular to the stress (see Figure 1.6).
The shear elasticity in solids is due to permanent interactions between
the constituent molecules of the materialâit is these interactions that
bind the solid together and give it its strength. The atoms and molecules
of a solid move about fixed positions within the material but are gener-
ally unable to migrate to other localities. In gases, on the other hand,
the molecules are widely separated, so that their movement is unhin-
dered almost all of the time. Interactions between molecules occur only
briefly during collisions. The liquid state is intermediate between these
extremes. Molecular interaction is important. It is manifest in properties
such as surface tension and the fact that liquids are quite difficult to

with Figure 1.5. Stress = F/S; velocity gradient = v/h; viscosity = n: n = (F/S)
- (v/h).

The Basics 21
compress, but the molecules do not occupy fixed sites and they are not
linked on any large scale to other molecules in their neighbourhood. The
free movement of molecules in liquids and gases allows the momentum in
one part of a fluid to be transferred to other parts, and the transfer of
momentum is the origin of the rate-dependent shear force. The resistance to
flow that it creates is called viscosity. It is characterized by the coefficient of
viscosity, rj, defined as
In acoustics and fluid mechanics, the coefficient of viscosity often appears
in association with the density p. The quantity rj/p is called the kinematic
viscosity. It should be understood that the velocity gradient in these
definitions applies to streamline (nonturbulent) flow. The air resistance in
turbulent flow that we notice on a windy day, for example, is not produced
by viscosity but by an aerodynamic phenomenon called drag. Curiously,
although drag is independent of the magnitude of the viscosity, it would
theoretically disappear if the viscosity were truly zero.
Viscoelasticity
In the foregoing discussion of elasticity no consideration was given to the
rate at which elastic changes occur following the application of a stress. No
deformation can be instantaneous because of inertia, but even when this is
negligible there may be internal molecular processes which delay the elastic
response. If the relationship between stress and strain is manifestly time
dependent, the material is said to be viscoelastic. Viscoelasticity is caused by,
for example, the breaking of intermolecular bonds and the realignment or
disentanglement of large molecules as deformation proceeds. Polymers often
show marked viscoelastic behaviour. The plastic materials used in food
packaging provide a good demonstration: if the wrapper from a package of
crisps is crumpled and released, the delayed recovery of its shape is obvious.
Biological tissue is viscoelastic; in an audiological context, this property is
relevant to the acoustic performance of the middle ear. When work is done
to change the size or shape of a viscoelastic body, the rate-dependent part
of the work is associated with an irreversible conversion to heat. The part
which does not depend on time is stored as elastic potential energy as
previously described.

22 Acoustics for Audiologists
Properties of Gases
The analysis of airborne sound is naturally the aspect of acoustics most
relevant to audiology; consequently, the physical properties of air, and gases
in general, that relate to acoustics are of special interest. At the temperatures
and pressures that generally prevail in our environment, air is almost an
ideal gas. An ideal gas is one for which it is always exactly true that
The relationship between pressure, volume, and temperature is called the
equation of state. It can be written as
where V is the volume of 1 gram-molecule of the gas, R is the universal gas
constant, and T is the absolute temperature of the gas. These terms need
explanation, and we digress slightly to provide it.
Molecular Weight: The Mole
Atomic and molecular weights express the masses of atoms and molecules
relative to that of a standard. In the SI system the standard is an atom of
the isotope carbon 12, which is deemed to have an atomic mass of exactly
12. A mole (abbreviation mol) is defined as a mass which always contains
the same number of 'elementary entities'. These entities, which must be
specified, are, for example, atoms, molecules, electrons, and so forth, and a
mole is the mass containing the same number of the named particles as there
are atoms in 0-012 kg of carbon 12. A mole in the sense of a gram-molecule
of substance therefore contains the same number of molecules as there are
atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12. This is, of course, an enormous number. It
is known as Avogadro's number and is approximately 6-0 x 1023. One of the
wonderful things about gases is that, at a given temperature and pressure,
equal volumes of gases of any type always contain the same number of
molecules. If, in Equation 1.9, the volume V is chosen to be the volume
containing 1 mole of the gas, the constant R has the same value for any kind
of gas (hence it is a universal constant). It is approximately 8-31 J K-1
mol"1.

The Basics 23
Absolute Temperature
According to the laws of thermodynamics, there is a theoretical limit to the
lowest temperature that can be attained. This temperature is called absolute
zero and it defines the starting point of the thermodynamic tem-
perature scale. The unit of temperature on this scale is called the kelvin (K).
It has the same magnitude as 1 degree on the Celsius scale; that is, the
temperature range from the freezing point to the boiling point of water is
both 100 K and 100Â°C. Absolute zero is approximately -273Â°C, so to
convert degrees Celsius to absolute temperature, one should add 273. The
freezing temperature of water is therefore 273 K and the boiling point is
373 K. In Equation 1.9, T is the absolute temperature and absolute zero is
the temperature at which the pressure of the hypothetical ideal gas would
vanish.
Isothermal and Adiabatic Processes
Suppose that a gas is contained in a cylinder that is closed at one end by a
moveable piston. If the piston is allowed to move outwards the gas will
expand, and as it does so work is done on the piston. This work is done at
the expense of the internal energy of the gas, and as a consequence its
temperature falls unless heat is supplied from an external source. The
opposite changes occur when the gas is compressed. In an isothermal
process, the heat supplied or removed exactly compensates the change in
internal energy so that the temperature remains constant. In an adiabatic
process, no heat is supplied or removed and temperature falls with expan-
sion and rises with compression. Volume changes that occur rapidly,
including those associated with the presence of sound, are usually adiabatic
because there is too little time for the exchange of heat; slow changes are
more likely to be isothermal.
The gas equation (Equation 1.9) tells us that in isothermal changes the
product of the pressure and volume of a gas is constant, that is,
This relationship is known as Boyle's law. The law for an adiabatic process
is more complicated because changes in temperature have to be taken into
consideration. It can be shown for an adiabatic change that

where y is the ratio of the principal specific heats as explained in the
next subsection. Equation 1.10 can be combined with Equation 1.9
to give corresponding relationships between other pairs of the variables P,
Kand T.
Specific Heats
The specific heat of a substance is the heat needed to raise the temperature
of a specified mass of it by 1 degree. Specific heat depends on the molecular
composition of the substance and on its state: specific heats of gases are
usually greater than those of liquids, and specific heats of liquids are usually
greater than those of solids. The specific heats of gases are important in
acoustics because they are related to the elastic bulk modulus and therefore
to acoustic properties such as the speed of sound.
The specific heat of a gas depends on whether or not it is allowed to
expand when heat is added. If expansion occurs, work has to be done to
move the boundaries of the container, and accordingly, the specific heat will
be greater than it would have been had the volume remained constant. The
principal specific heats Cp and Cv are those defined for the conditions of
constant pressure and constant volume, respectively. The difference between
Cp and Cv is the same for all gases so long as their equation of state is
approximately that of an ideal gas. It can be shown that Cp â Cv = R when
a mass of 1 gram-molecule is specified. The ratio of the principal specific
heats is denoted by y; that is, y = Cp/Cv. This ratio does depend on the type
of gas and particularly on its molecular form. For monatoim'c gases it is
approximately 5/3, for diatomic gases 7/5, and for more complicated
molecules it is closer to unity.
Bulk Modulus of a Gas
In defining the bulk modulus (Equation 1.7), the volume strain was said to
be the relative decrease in volume caused by the application of a pressure.
A gas has to be contained in some way to prevent it expanding indefinitely,
and this means that a finite pressure is always present. In acoustics, this
pressure is often atmospheric pressure and it may be regarded as constant
because atmospheric changes take place very slowly compared with the
pressure changes due to sound. So far as the modulus is concerned, the stress
should be thought of as a very small increase, dP, in the prevailing pressure
P. The volume strain is similarly defined as a very small (negative) increase,

â 5V, in the preexisting volume. Therefore,
From this definition and Equations 1.9 and 1.10 it can be shown that
and
The Atmosphere
Air contains 78% nitrogen (by volume) and 21% oxygen, together with
small quantities of other substances, notably water vapour and carbon
dioxide. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is approximately 1 x 105 Nm~2,
although small fluctuations are always occurring with changing meteoro-
logical conditions. It is customary to express atmospheric pressure in
millibars (mbar). One bar is 105 Nm~2, so the pressure at sea level is
approximately 1000 mbar. This is also 1000 hectopascals (hPa), the prefix
hecto meaning '100'. But for changes in temperature, air pressure would
diminish in an almost perfectly exponential fashion with increasing altitude.
Near sea level the decrease is approximately 130 mbar for every 1000 metres.
If the air is dry its temperature falls steadily by about 6-5Â°C for every 1000
metres increase in height up to 11,100 metres, which, in the middle latitudes,
is the base of a region called the stratosphere. Here the temperature remains
almost constant at â 56-5Â°C up to an altitude of 20,000 metres, beyond
which it increases slightly.
In order to provide a general description of the atmosphere and, in
particular, to calibrate and use aviation flight instruments, a Standard
Atmosphere has been specified by the International Civil Aviation Organ-
ization (Table 1.1). At sea level the standard temperature is 15Â°C (288-15 K)
and the standard pressure is 1-01325 mbar. (The reason for choosing
this rather curious pressure as the standard is that it is a conversion
to millibars of a former standard, namely 760 torr, where 1 torr is the
pressure equal to 760 mm Hg). The standard density of air at sea level
is l-2250kgm~3.

Vibrations
Terminology
An object is said to vibrate if it undergoes a rapid to-and-fro movement
about a more or less fixed position. The term vibration is a general one by
which such movement may be described, and there is no requirement for the
movement to be regular or cyclicâit could in fact be completely haphaz-
ard. We usually think of vibrations in the mechanical sense, that is, as a
description of the movement of physical bodies or structures or parts of such
things, but the term and the analysis of vibrations extend to a description
of motion in elastic solids and fluids and to descriptions of nonmaterial
objects, including, for example, the vibrations in an electromagnetic wave.
An oscillation is a particular kind of vibration in which the movement is
periodic. This means that the pattern of the displacement relative to the
fixed position repeats itself at regular intervals. The interval is called the
period of the oscillation It is usually represented by the symbol T and
measured in seconds. The sequence of events that describes the motion
during the period is called a cycle. The rate at which cycles are repeated is
called the frequency. Frequency is the reciprocal of the period. It is
measured in hertz (Hz). Therefore,
These definitions of period, cycle, and frequency can be extended to
include oscillations for which successive cycles are not identical. For
example, the vibrations of a tuning fork or a plucked string gradually
diminish, but their periodicity, and therefore their frequency, remain con-
stant.
Vibrations that follow an initial disturbance of a system but which depend
only on the properties of the system itself are called free vibrations. The
period of a free vibration is called the natural period, and the corresponding
frequency is called the natural frequency. A vibration that is maintained by
the application of a periodic force is called a forced vibration.

Sinusoidal Oscillations:
Simple Harmonic Motion
Sinusoidal oscillation (also called harmonic oscillation) is of first importance
in acoustics and in the science of vibrations generally. The reason for this is
not that sinusoids occur frequently in nature (they do occur, but not
frequently), but that all periodic vibrations â and indeed most nonperiodic
onesâcan be produced, at least theoretically, by the addition of a large
number of sinusoids. This will be considered further in Chapter 5, but the
point to be made here is that the analysis of complex vibrations in terms of
sinusoids is a great help to understanding many acoustic phenomena, and
whether or not the analysis has been made formally, the fact that it is
possible is often tacitly and perhaps unconsciously assumed. In audiology,
for example, one may talk of the various frequency components of speech
sounds. Although the speech signal itself does contain regions which are
quasi-periodic, it would be impossible to ascribe a frequency to the signal
overall. It is the concept of its synthesis from sinusoidal elements that makes
the frequency-specific description possible. It should be noted that many
terms apply only to sinusoidal motion, and care should be taken to avoid
using them in other contexts.1
In learning about vibrations, a good starting point is to consider the
properties of an elementary oscillator consisting of just a mass and a spring.
An oscillator of this type is shown in Figure 2.1. In the configuration
depicted here, one end of the spring is fixed and the other end of the spring
supports a mass lying vertically below the fixture. We know that if the mass
is pushed upwards slightly to compress the spring and then released, it will
oscillate in the vertical direction. It is not easy to think of practical examples
of oscillators made in exactly this way, but the working principle is found
in many applications. For example, the balance wheel of a mechanical clock
or watch is a similar form of oscillator, though it differs from the one
described here because its motion is rotary rather than linear. An ordinary
pendulum swinging through a small arc also oscillates in a similar way,
again with a rotary instead of a linear motion and with gravity instead of a
spring as the source of the restoring force. The important thing to recognize
is that many oscillators are essentially the combination of a mass and a
spring. Moreover, these components have their counterparts in many
electrical circuits and acoustic systems. Providing that the displacement is
not too great, the spring behaves in a linear fashionâit supplies a force that
is directly proportional to the displacement. An oscillator comprising a mass
and linear spring is called a simple harmonic oscillator.
1 Examples are angular frequency, amplitude, phase, wavelength, and impedance.

Vibrations 29
FIG. 2.1 Simple harmonic oscillator.
Let us consider the mass-spring system shown in the figure and describe
exactly how the mass moves under the action of the force provided by the
spring. The influence of gravity on the attached mass is constant and need
not be considered, and the spring itself is assumed to have negligible mass.
We will suppose that the mass moves only in the direction of the axis of the
spring, that is, vertically in the configuration shown in the figure. The spring
is characterized by its stiffness, defined as the ratio of the force produced by
the spring divided by the amount the spring is extended or compressed. To
start with, suppose that the system is completely at rest with the mass m at
a position 0. Now let the mass be raised through a distance a (in the
positive y-direction) and released so that the spring, which was compressed
by raising the mass, begins to expand, driving the mass downwards. In
general, if the compression of the spring is y, and, if its stiffness is s, it exerts
a force of magnitude sy upon the mass. This force is directed towards 0,
that is, in the opposite direction to the displacement j; and it is opposed by
the inertia of the mass. The mass must therefore move in accordance with
the following statement:
The minus sign is needed because the force provided by the spring is always
in the opposite direction to the displacement of the mass. We write this
equation symbolically as
where the symbol y denotes acceleration in the ^-direction.

30 Acoustics for Audiologists
Equation 2.1 is called the equation of motion of the oscillator. We see that
it describes movement of a mass about a fixed point such that the
acceleration is always directed towards that point and is always propor-
tional to the distance from it. This is called simple harmonic motion. Now,
the equation of motion is only a general statement about how the mass will
move in keeping with Newton's laws once oscillation has been started. In
order to understand the oscillator more thoroughly, we need to ask where
the mass will be at any given time. An answer to this question is called a
solution of the equation of motion. It depends, of course, on when timing is
started (how time t = 0 is chosen) and the conditions prevailing at that time.
By 'conditions' we mean the initial state of the oscillator, for example, the
displacement and velocity of the mass at t = 0. It can be shown that simple
harmonic motion is strictly sinusoidal and that the equation of motion has
the solution
The symbols a, co, and (j) represent constants whose meaning will now be
explained.
Amplitude
The sine function in Equation 2.2 is dimensionless (without units) and its
value ranges from â1 to +1. The displacement y, on the other hand, has
units of length (metres), and the range of values it can take depends on the
amount by which the oscillator was disturbed from its initial state of rest,
just as the vibration of a tuning fork or a guitar string depends on how hard
the fork was struck or how firmly the string was plucked to start with. The
constant a therefore has to incorporate the units of measurement and ensure
that the displacement is given over the correct range of values. This constant
is called the amplitude of the vibration. It is equal to the greatest displace-
ment in the cycle. The term amplitude should be used only to denote the
greatest value as just defined; the tendency, particularly prevalent in sciences
other than mathematics and physics, to use it as a general term is to be
resisted.
It can be shown that if the displacement varies sinusoidally then the
velocity and the acceleration also vary sinusoidally. The same is true
according to context of other quantities, such as voltage, current, force, and
sound pressure, when sinusoidal oscillation is involved. The definition of
amplitude can therefore be extended to include velocity amplitude, pressure
amplitude, and so on, as the names given to the greatest value in the cycle.

Vibrations 31
Angular Frequency
A sine function is a function of an angle. In mathematics this angle is called
the argument of the function. The rate at which the angle is changing in
Equation 2.2 is equal to co radians per second. If the angle increases
continuously, its sine is repeated for each increase of 2n radians so that the
number of cycles completed in every second is co/2n. The angular frequency
a) is therefore defined as 2n times the frequency of the sinusoidal oscillation,
that is,
We have been describing the oscillation of a body that is moving
in a straight line, and it may seem strange that an angleâmoreover,
one that is constantly changingâhas now appeared in the description.
It should be understood that this is in a sense an analogy because the
rotation of an actual physical object is not involved. The analogy, which
comes of course from geometry, is a convenient and universally recog-
nized description of harmonic oscillation, in which the movement of the
oscillating object is likened to the movement of a point around the
circumference of a circle. We should notice that the word cycleâso
necessary for the portrayal of oscillatory behaviourâhas its origins ai a
Greek word meaning a circle. The radius to the moving point on the
circumference is a line that rotates about the centre of the circle like the
spoke of a wheel. Its projection in a fixed direction generates the sine
function used here to describe the linear oscillation (see Appendix A).
Angular frequency has a meaning only in the context of sinusoidal motion,
whereas ordinary frequency (the reciprocal of the period) can be used in the
description of any repetitive event.
For the simple harmonic oscillator it can be shown that
and therefore
These equations make quantitative what one would expect intuitively,
namely, that a stiff system, with a large value of s, vibrates more rapidly than
a compliant one, and that a system with a small mass m vibrates more
rapidly than one with a large mass.

32 Acoustics for Audiologists
Phase
The word phase means the stage reached in a periodically recurring
sequence. When the sequence can be described by a sinusoid, the stage in
the sequence can obviously be described in terms of the angle for which the
sine function is calculated. In Equation 2.2 the whole quantity in the
parentheses is an angle, and the constant part, (j), which forms part of the
total angle is called the phase angle. This term usually denotes the 
difference
in the phases of two sinusoids, for example, the one given by the equation
and a corresponding sinusoid for which (j) = 0. The phase angle has been
included in Equation 2.2 to allow for the possibility that time may be
reckoned from any instant in the cycle. If time zero is chosen to be a
moment when the displacement is zero and about to increase, then 0 is zero
(or a multiple of 2n} and it can be omitted. If, however, time zero is chosen
as the moment when the displacement attains its greatest positive value,
then O = Ti/2.
It often happens that we want to compare two sinusoids, for example, the
displacements of two oscillators running at the same time, or the sinusoids
representing the force on the mass and the velocity of the mass. When the
frequencies are the same, we can write these sinusoids as
and
Here it is clear that the phase angle expresses the difference in phase between
the vibrations y1 and y2. If O is positive a given epoch occurs earlier in y2
than in yv When this happens we say that y2 leads yv Conversely, if the
phase difference is negative, we say that y2 lags y1.
Displacement, Velocity, and
Acceleration
Velocity, the rate of change of displacement, and acceleration, the rate of
change of velocity, are important attributes of a vibrating system. For any
sinusoidal variation, the displacement, velocity, and acceleration are related
to each other by the angular frequency. The following important relation-
ships should be noted:
velocity amplitude = angular frequency x displacement amplitude
acceleration amplitude = angular frequency x velocity amplitude

Vibrations 33
In the foregoing text we have used the symbol a to denote the amplitude
of a displacement y and have represented velocity and acceleration by y and
y but in other parts of this book we will often use the symbols E, u, and a
to denote, respectively, displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Let us add
the subscript 'p' when an amplitude (rather than the general value) is
required. Then, for example, a sinusoidal oscillation with displacement
amplitude Â£p can be represented by
The previously shown relationships between the amplitudes of displacement,
velocity, and acceleration can then be written algebraically as
These are important relationships which should be memorized if they are
not intuitively obvious. They apply equally to root mean square (rms)
values.
Energy of Free Vibrations
The simple harmonic oscillator depicted in the previous section is a
hypothetical construction because once set in motion it continues indefi-
nitely without loss of energy. The energy it possesses is at all times the
energy given to it during the disturbance which started the oscillation. This
energy is shared between the kinetic energy of the moving mass and the
potential energy stored in the spring, and the two energies are constantly
interchanged during the cycle. Motion ceases momentarily when the dis-
placement is greatest, and at these instants the energy is entirely potential.
When, on the other hand, the displacement passes through zero, the energy
is all kinetic. Since the total energy is the same at any point in the cycle, this
energy must be equal to the potential energy when the displacement is
greatest, that is, when y equals a. Recalling that elastic potential energy is
equal to the stiffness multiplied by half the square of the displacement
(Chapter 1), we see that the energy E of the oscillator is given by
and, by substituting for s from Equation 2.3,
The important thing to notice here is that the energy is proportional to the
square of the amplitude. A similar relationship exists between the energy in a
sound wave and the vibration of the medium in which the sound is carried.

34 Acoustics for Audiologists
Damped Vibrations
Perpetual motion is the stuff of science fiction; any real vibration is
associated with a progressive loss of energy that will eventually bring it to
an end. An oscillator can lose energy in several ways depending on how it
interacts with its surroundings, but one of the simplest and most general
ways is through a force that opposes the motion in proportion to the
velocity at any given moment. Fluid viscosity can provide just such a force,
though in acoustics viscosity is often unimportant and instead energy
dissipation may come from the transfer of vibrations themselves to other
vibrating systems or regions of the sound field through the creation of sound
waves. This will be considered later, but it may be remarked here that in
many circumstances the acoustic radiation from a vibrating object does
exert a reaction on the object that is, to a fair approximation, proportional
to its velocity.
The process whereby the amplitude of oscillation of a system is progress-
ively diminished through an irreversible loss of energy is called damping. The
force that resists the motion divided by the velocity is called the damping
coefficient, and if this ratio is constant then the damping is described as
viscous damping. We can express this symbolically by adding the damping
term to the equation of motion (Equation 2.1), which now becomes
where c, a constant, is the damping coefficient and j; is the velocity in the
y-direction.
The solutions to this equation fall into two categories depending on the
magnitude of the damping coefficient, that is, on how much damping is
present. If the damping is heavy, the system does not oscillate but instead
makes a gradual return to equilibrium following the initial disturbance. On
the other hand, if the damping is light, the system does oscillate but the
oscillations diminish exponentially. At the boundary between these condi-
tions the damping is said to be critical. This happens when c â 2com, where
co is the angular frequency for undamped vibrations (Equation 2.3). The
influence of viscous damping on free vibrations is illustrated in (Figure 2.2).
The oscillation shown at the top of the diagram is undamped. The
oscillations shown below this are subject to progressively more damping, as
indicated by the value of the parameter c2/4sm. Critical damping occurs
when this is equal to 1.
Damping is an important consideration in the design of systems that are
able to undergo free oscillations. In a moving-coil meter (of the type often
found in sound-level meters and other measuring equipment), the movement

Vibrations 
35
FIG. 2.2 Damped harmonic motion.
has to be damped to prevent the pointer oscillating every time there is a
change in the input being measured. Similarly, microphones and sound
sources may have to be damped to prevent oscillation ('ringing'). Ideally, the
damping should be close to the critical value to give as rapid a response as
possible without unwanted oscillation.
Forced Vibrations
Many vibrating systems normally have their motion maintained by an
external input that provides a driving force. Relevant examples include
loudspeakers, earphones, and bone vibrators maintained by an electrical
input, as well as the electronic oscillators and filters found in most electronic
equipment. The force needed to maintain a vibration must of course vary
with time, and we can represent it symbolically as f(t). The equation of
motion for the simple mass-spring-damper system described earlier be-
comes, with the addition of this force,
If f(t) is periodic (a sinusoid, for example), the motion of the system is

36 Acoustics for Audiologists
described as a forced vibration or forced oscillation. Its frequency is the same
as that of the driving force.
In general, the ideas presented here can be applied to complex systems
that comprise one or more parts in which free oscillation could occur. The
driving force can be thought of, or described as, a sinusoidal 'stimulus' or
'excitation' at the input to the system to which the system as a whole
responds. The response is a defined measure of the output that accompanies
a defined excitation. It is influenced by the damping and natural frequency
of any oscillatory components. A response can be expressed, for example, in
terms of quantities such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, sound
pressure, current, voltage, and so on according to context. The term
frequency response denotes the way in which a given form of response
depends on the excitation frequency; phase response denotes the way in
which the phase of a given response varies with frequency relative to the
phase at the input. Readers will be familiar with frequency response in the
context of hearing aids, where the term describes the variation in the output
of the aid as a function of the frequency of the sound at its input. Phase
response is important in the design of filters and amplifiers, where it is often
desirable that the input and output should have the same phase regardless
of frequency.
Resonance
The Oxford English Dictionary explains resonance as 'the reinforcement or
prolongation of sound by reflection or synchronous vibration'. It then
defines resonance in the mechanical sense as 'a condition in which an object
or system is subjected to an oscillating force having a frequency close to its
own natural frequency'. These definitions certainly accord with our everyday
understanding of resonance, and indeed the word is often used figuratively
to convey the sense of reinforcement. In the acoustical sense, resonance is
easily understood in the context of simple vibrations. Hold down a key on
a piano and sound the same note with a tuning fork. The piano string will
be set in motion as its natural vibration is reinforced by the synchronous
vibration of the tuning fork. The concept of synchronous reinforcement is
also found in areas that have nothing to do with acoustics. The following
quotation is from Lord Rayleigh's treatise, The Theory of Sound:
Illustration of the powerful effects of isochronism must be within the experience of
every one. They are often of importance in very different fields from any with which
acoustics is concerned. For example, few things are more dangerous to a ship than
to lie in the trough of the sea under the influence of waves whose period is nearly
that of its own natural rolling.

Vibrations 37
There is an alternative definition2 of resonance in terms of frequency
response that avoids direct reference to natural vibrations. In general,
resonance is a condition associated with forced sinusoidal oscillation. If a
system is driven sinusoidally by a force of constant magnitude (that is, if the
amplitude of the sinusoid describing the force is constant), then there may
exist one or more frequencies for which the response of the system is a
maximum. In other words, the frequency-response curve may contain peaks.
Resonance is said to occur if the system is driven at a frequency where the
response is a maximum. This frequency is called the resonance frequency.
Any small change in frequency relative to the resonance frequency will cause
a decrease in the response. Correspondingly, antiresonance is said to occur
at minima that may exist in the frequency response. The frequency-response
definition of resonance has the advantage that it can be applied to quite
complex systems, including, of course, the human ear. The difficulty is that
peaks in the frequency response may occur for reasons unconnected with
the existence of natural vibrations. It would therefore be wise to speak of
resonance only when it is associated with some clearly identifiable natural
vibration. The maxima and minima in parts of the frequency-response
function of a hearing aid may well be attributable to resonance and
antiresonance in the output tube and earmould, in which free vibration is
clearly possible. On the other hand, a peak in the response of a sound-level
meter might come from the combination of diffraction at the microphone
giving a rising output with increasing frequency, and a weighting circuit with
a falling frequency characteristic in the amplifier. The peak in the overall
response would then not be resonance in the sense of the first of the previous
definitions.
The peak in the frequency response around a resonance frequency may
be quite broad or it may be sharply defined. Whether a particular response
is desirable depends on circumstances. In hearing aids, for example, we
would usually consider resonances to be undesirable, and a broad peak
would be preferable to a narrow one. On the other hand, a sharply tuned
circuit might be desirable in a filter designed to accept (or exclude) only a
narrow band of frequencies. The sharpness of a peak in the frequency
response, that is, the ratio of the height of the peak to its width, is called the
quality factor (Q-factor). This factor depends on the type of response, but
unless otherwise specified it may be assumed when dealing with mechanical
or acoustic systems that the required response is the velocity response. We
therefore think of the Q-factor as a measure of the sharpness of a resonance
peak in the function that describes how the velocity of a system varies with
2See, for example, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60050-801 (1994), Interna-
tional electrotechnical vocabulary-â Chapter 801: Acoustics and electroacoustics.

38 Acoustics for Audiologists
frequency when it is driven by fixed-amplitude sinusoidal force or pressure.
In the electrical case, we speak of voltage rather than force and of current
rather than velocity. The Q-factor is defined as 2n times the mean stored
energy in an oscillator divided by the energy that has to be supplied during
each cycle to maintain the oscillation at resonance.
An alternative definition gives Q as the resonance frequency divided by
the 'half-power bandwidth'. This definition is often used when describing the
performance of electrical filters. To understand it, suppose that an alternat-
ing voltage supply is connected to a load (such as a resistance) through a
filter. The power dissipated in the load is proportional to the square of the
current passing through it, and we can measure this power at the resonance
frequency. There are two frequencies, one above and one below the
resonance frequency, at which the power is half that at resonance. The
half-power bandwidth is the difference between these frequencies. The half-
power frequencies are sometimes called the cut-off frequencies of the
filter. They are frequencies at which the attenuation produced by the
filter is 3 dB greater than the attenuation at resonance. The velocity
resonance of a simple oscillator and the definition of the (Mactor are
illustrated in Figure 2.3.
Root Mean Square Values
When describing free vibrations, it was noted that the energy stored in a free
harmonic oscillator is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the
vibration. This is true when the amplitude is a measure of peak displace-
ment, peak velocity, peak acceleration, or indeed the peak value of any
quantity that is proportional to these measures.
The kinetic and potential energies of an oscillator vary throughout the
cycle. At a given instant, the kinetic energy is proportional to the square of
the velocity at that instant, and the potential energy is proportional to the
square of the displacement. The average kinetic energy during a complete
cycle is therefore proportional to the average value of the square of the
velocity (the mean squared velocity), and the average potential energy is
proportional to the average of the square of the displacement. The square
root of the average squared value is called the root mean square or rms value.
Therefore the mean kinetic energy in the cycle is proportional to (rms
velocity)2, and the mean potential energy in the cycle is proportional to (rms
displacement)2. Because, at a given frequency, the rms displacement, rms
velocity, and rms acceleration are proportional to one another, the mean
kinetic energy and the mean potential energy are proportional to the
squares of the rms values of any of these quantities. It is therefore true to

Vibrations 39
say that the total energy of an oscillator (kinetic plus potential) is propor-
tional to the square of the rms displacement or rms velocity, and so forth.
The force needed to maintain an oscillation also varies sinusoidally
throughout the cycle. It too can be represented by an rms value. It can be
shown that the average power dissipated in viscous damping is given by
FIG. 2.3 Resonance and Q-factor.
where W is the average power dissipated in the cycle, Ftms and uTms are the
root mean square force and velocity, and O is the phase difference between
the sinusoids representing the force and the velocity. Readers who have
some knowledge of electronics will see that this expression is the same as
that for the power dissipated in a circuit carrying an alternating current.
Many observations in acoustics are fundamentally related to acoustic
power, often as power radiated by a source or carried in a sound wave. The
root mean square expression of quantities related to power is therefore
especially important. Sound-measuring equipment includes circuits that
automatically square and average the incoming signal and present the result
in terms of sound power, expressed usually in decibels. This will be described
later.
Finally, it may be noted that in any sinusoid the rms value is equal
to the amplitude divided by /2. If the rms values are replaced by the

40 Acoustics for Audiologists
corresponding amplitudes, the previous equation becomes
where Fp and up are the force amplitude and velocity amplitude, respec-
tively.

Distinguish between displacement amplitude and velocity amplitude of
an harmonic oscillator. Two oscillators comprising mass and spring
elements have the same mass, but one runs at twice the frequency of
the other. Explain why they each have the same average kinetic
energy when their velocity amplitudes are equal, but different kinetic
energies when their displacement amplitudes are equal. For the latter
condition, what is the ratio of the energy of the higher-frequency
oscillator to that of the lower-frequency oscillator?

Square the values of sinx, add them, and divide by 10 to find the
average. Find the square root of the average. The answer may be a
surprise!
2.17 For a sinusoidal displacement, the rms velocity is co times the rms

peak acceleration for a 2-kHz oscillation with a displacement ampli-
tude of 0-5 jum.
2.18 An hydraulic damper is driven sinusoidally at a frequency of 7 Hz.
The stroke of the damper is 3 mm. A force transducer shows that the
rms force applied to the damper is 27 N. Calculate the rms velocity
of the driving rod at the point where the force is applied and,
assuming that the force is proportional to the velocity of the driving
rod throughout the cycle, calculate the average absorbed power.
2.19* The period T of a simple pendulum is given by the formula
where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the gravitational acceleration
9-81 ms"2. Make a simple pendulum by suspending a weight from a
fixed object with some suitable thread. Use a stopwatch or other
timer to measure the period of oscillation for various different lengths
measured from the point of suspension to a fixed mark on the weight.
The swing of the pendulum should be small ânot more than 30Â°. Plot
a graph of T2 against L. It should be a straight line. Verify that the
slope of the line is equal to 4n2/g.
2.20* Make a simple pendulum as described in the previous question. Use
a weight of about 1 kg and make the thread reasonably longâseveral
metres if possible. With a piece of card or other suitable material,
construct a scale that will enable you to estimate the amplitude of the
oscillation. It may help to attach a pointer to the weight. Set the
pendulum in motion and record the amplitudes of oscillation at
suitable intervals. For example, record the amplitudes of every third
or every fifth oscillation. Expect the amplitude to diminish exponen-
tially, that is, An = A0e~kn, where An is the amplitude of the nth
oscillation counting from any arbitrary starting point, and where A0
and k are constants. Plot a graph of logAn against n. Expect the
graph to be a straight line. If logarithms to base 10 are used, the slope
of the line will be â fc/2-3, from which the decay constant k can be
calculated.

Sound Waves
What is Sound?
Sound is both the name given to the sensation of hearing caused by
vibrations of the air and the name that describes the vibrations themselves.
Much of audiology is concerned with the relationship between these
perceptual and physical attributes of sound. Audiometry, for example,
relates the onset of sensation to frequency and intensity; hearing aid
technology considers speech recognition in relation to the many physical
characteristics that define the speech signal itself and the acoustic back-
ground that accompanies it. Generally when we talk of sound, we do so in
the context of vibrations at frequencies that are audible to the human ear.
The frequency range for hearing is often given as 20 Hz to 20 kHz, but in
fact the limits are not so clearly defined. The highest audible frequency
depends considerably on the listener, and it declines quite rapidly with
increasing age. Tones whose frequencies are above the upper limit are
completely inaudible, but at the other extreme tones may in fact be audible
down to frequencies of a few hertz. Below about 15 Hz, however, sound loses
its tonal quality. Very low frequency sound is called infrasound. It is created
by gunfire, for example, and has been used in the location of enemy artillery.
At the other end of the spectrum, sound at frequencies from 10 kHz to
frequencies well beyond the range of human hearing is called ultrasound. It
has numerous medical and industrial applications.
When an object vibrates, it disturbs the air around it and the disturbance
is propagated as a sound wave. The vibrating object is called a source, and
the region in which sound waves exist is called a sound field. The air in direct
contact with a vibrating surface of a source moves with the surface, but as
the movement is imparted to the surrounding air, the inertia of the air
together with its capacity for elastic compression and expansion results in a
motion that is delayed relative to that of the source. The compression and
expansion is accompanied by a local increase and decrease in pressure
relative to the pressure that normally exists in the absence of sound. The
latter, called static pressure, is the normal atmospheric pressure. The
fluctuating pressure is known as sound pressure. It is perhaps the most
43

44 Acoustics for Audiologists
important manifestation of sound. It provides the physical input that is the
basis of human hearing and indeed the hearing of all animal species that
possess this sense, and it is the sound property detected by most (though
not all) microphones. Sound pressure is a characteristic of the sound that
creates it. Its alternation has the same frequency as the sound, and its
variation with time is the pressure waveform of the sound which we would
see, for example, with an oscilloscope connected to a microphone via a
suitable amplifier. We should think of sound pressure at any instant as a
small quantity, positive or negative, added to the prevailing static pressure.
It is important to understand just how small sound pressure is in compari-
son with atmospheric pressure. For example, the peak sound pressure in a
sinusoidal tone at 100 dB SPL is about 2-8 Pa; atmospheric pressure is
approximately 100,000 Pa.
Sound Particles
To enquire further into the nature of sound, it is necessary to have some
way of describing vibrations in the air caused by the presence of a sound
field. At first this may seem something of a problem because not only is air
invisible, but so far as sound is concerned, we know that the movement we
are interested in varies from place to place. We are not interested in the
movement of air in bulk but in the local vibrations that constitute sound.
The problem of description is solved by imagining that the air consists of
particles that vibrate in response to the passage of sound. Such particles are
often called molecules, but this can be misleading because in science the
word molecule denotes a special object, namely, an atom or cluster of atoms
with specific chemical and physical properties. The particle in acoustics is
merely a very small 'piece' of air that shares the vibration of the air as sound
is carried. It is not a real object in the sense that a molecule is, but a mental
construction to aid description. Its size and shape are undefined. The only
requirement is that it should be very small compared with the wavelength
of the prevailing sound. Sound particles do not move haphazardly with
thermal energy as do physical molecules. Their movement is determined
entirely by the sound vibrations.
If we fix our attention on any chosen region within a sound field, we can
imagine the particles to move about fixed positions in time with the sound
vibrations. The movement of a particle can then be described in terms of its
displacement from the fixed point, its velocity, its acceleration, and so on.
We therefore have, as a description of the movement of the air, terms such
as particle displacement, particle velocity, and particle acceleration.

Sound Waves 45
Sound Waves
Most of us have some idea of what a wave is. We have seen waves on the
seashore or ripples on the surface of a pond. Hold one end of a rope and
shake it, and a wave is seen to travel towards the other end. Although the
idea seems clear enough, a precise definition of what is meant by a wave is
not so easy to formulate. Yet the description and analysis of physical
phenomena in terms of wave theory is one of the great unifying themes in
science. It is found in the theory of optics and of electromagnetic radiation
generally, in mechanics and acoustics, in the conduction of heat, and,
through quantum theory, as part of the very nature of the elementary
particles that make up the universe. So far as acoustics is concerned, we seek
a mental picture of exactly what sound waves are. We will find that acoustic
waves share many of the properties of waves of all types and that the
general principles of wave theory provide a useful insight into the way in
which sound is propagated and the way it interacts with objects in the
environment.
A sound wave is a mental or mathematical construction that describes the
sound particle displacement in terms of both time and position within a
sound field. The waves seen on the surface of a pond provide an analogy,
and although there are several important differences between acoustic waves
and surface waves in water, the visibility of the latter is helpful in providing
the appropriate mental picture. If we look at such waves two features are
immediately obvious. The first is that at any instant the vertical displace-
ment of the surface forms an extended pattern consisting of a rise and fall
of the surface relative to its undisturbed level. The second is that the pattern
as a whole appears to move outward from the source of the disturbance with
a steady speed. However, an object floating on the surface would move only
up and down as waves passâit would not move outwards with the wave.
The wave system is produced by vertical movements in adjacent areas of the
surface so timed as to create the moving pattern (Figure 3.1). Waves that
move, that advance from regions where vibrations exist to regions hitherto
undisturbed, are called progressive waves. This distinguishes them from
standing waves, which will be described later.
A defining feature of wave motion is that the displacement depends on
time and positionâthe pattern exists both temporally and spatially, and
providing that the speed of the wave is independent of frequency, the profile
of the wave remains unchanged. To illustrate this we will consider waves
travelling in a specified direction, which, for the sake of discussion, will be
the x-axis, as shown in Figure 3.2. Suppose we have a source located at the
origin, that is, at x = 0. Any source would do, but for the sake of this

46 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 3.1 Wave motion: a floating object moves only up and down as the wave
passes. It is not caried forward with the wave.
explanation it is helpful to choose one that produces an asymmetrical
waveform, a periodic triangular (sawtooth) wave for example, with a
gradual displacement in one direction and a rapid displacement in the other.
Imagine that the source is first turned on at time t â 0. As time passes, the
wave train, emerging from the source, moves outwards as a whole into the
undisturbed medium.
Figure 3.3 shows the wave in two ways. In the upper diagram it is
shown as it was in the previous figure, as a function of distance from
the source at the arbitrary time t'. The medium is disturbed over the dis-
tance ct' that the wave has advanced since the source was turned on,
but beyond this point it is still at rest. In the lower diagram the wave is
shown as a function of time, that is, we see the time waveform of the
vibration at a fixed distance x' from the source. The wave, travelling
outwards from the source with velocity c, takes a time x'/c to reach this
point. Up to this time the medium is undisturbed, and afterwards its
movement is the same as that of the source from the moment it was first
turned on. In the water surface analogy, it is the movement of a cork floating
at a distance x' from the origin of the waves. Note that the displacement-
time pattern is the same as the displacement-distance pattern except that it
is reversed from left to right.
The ideas just discussed can be expressed mathematically in a very neat
way by observing that the particle displacement Â£ depends not on time alone
or on position alone but on the difference between the distance that the wave
trvels in time t and the distance from the source. We can write this

Sound Waves 47

waveform. Particle displacement is shown on the vertical axis; distance from the
source is shown on the horizontal axis.
formally1 as
Similar expressions apply, of course, to waves travelling along the y-
or z-axes.
Waves on the surface of water are called transverse waves, meaning that
the displacement of the surface is at right angles to the direction in which
1The equation should be read as 'displacment is a function of ct â x', meaning that displace-
ment depends on the difference between ct and x. For function see Appendix A.

FIG. 3.3 Wave motion, showing how the waveform is represented as a variation

as a variation with time at a given location (bottom).
the wave is advancing. The vibrations of a string, in a musical instrument
for example, can also be treated as waves (standing waves). Again, these are
transverse waves. Sound waves in gases and liquids, however, are always
longitudinal waves, in which the particles move in the same direction as the
wave. For the type of disturbance normally described as a sound wave, it is
essential that neighbouring parts of the medium should be coupled elasti-
cally. The forces on a particle in one small volume have to be communicated
to neighbouring particles by what can be imagined as an elastic link. For
sound waves in air, the elasticity is associated with compression or expan-
sion as previously stated. Transverse acoustic waves are possible in solids,
where they produce a shear deformation. Shear, which is a change in shape
without a change in volume, can be elastic in solids but it is inelastic in air.
The shear modulus of a gas is zero and accordingly, air cannot support
transverse sound waves.
The longitudinal wave motion of sound in air is rather difficult to imagine
because it is something outside everyday visual experience. Figure 3.4 may
help. In this diagram the sound is taken to be sinusoid (a pure tone), and
distance from the source in the direction of the sound wave is shown from
left to right. Time is shown from top to bottom. Each row of dots represents
the positions of sound particles at a given instant. The top row shows the

Sound Waves 49
FIG. 3.4 Particle displacement in a longitudinal wave.
particles in the undisturbed field at the moment just before sound has
reached the leftmost particle; the other rows show the same particles at
successively later times. The way the displacement of any one particle
changes with time can be seen by following the movement of the same dot
from row to row. In the top row the particles are all at rest. They occupy
the equilibrium positions about which they will vibrate when the sound
reaches them. It will be seen that as the wave proceeds, each particle in turn
is set in motion. Adjacent particles do not move exactly in step with one
another because there is a slight delay as the wave advances from one
particle to the next. The cumulative effect of this is to create regions in which
the particles are packed either more closely or more loosely than they were
in the undisturbed state. These changes correspond to compression and
expansion of the air. As the particles themselves oscillate sinusoidally in a
horizontal direction, the regions of compression and expansion advance
from left to right.
The motion of the individual particles is akin to that of a pendulumâ
they are momentarily at rest at the extreme displacement where the
direction of movement reverses, and they have their greatest velocity as they
pass through the central (equilibrium) position. Looking along any row in
the diagram, we should observe that the particles are closest to each other
or most widely separated when their velocity is greatest but that they have
their normal spacing at the turning points where the velocity is zero. This
is demonstrated more clearly in Figure 3.5. The figure shows two sinusoids,
labelled 1 and 2, that are identical except that 2 follows 1 after a small delay.
These sinusoids represent the oscillations of two adjacent particles in one of

FIG. 3.5 Displacement of neighbouring particles 1 and 2 in a longitudinal wave.
the rows in the previous figure. At A and A', where the particles are close
to their equilibrium positions, the curves have their greatest separation
vertically. This means that the difference in the displacements is greatest. At
A the displacement of particle 1 is towards the right of the diagram, in the
direction of propagation of the wave, and the displacement of particle 2 is
is in the opposite direction. The particles are therefore closest to each other
in this part of the cycle, the compression of the air is greatest, and the sound
pressure is a maximum. The opposite happens at A. At B and B', where the
particles are approaching their greatest distance from their resting positions,
their displacements are almost identical. The particles therefore have the
same separation as they had in the undisturbed sound field, the air is neither
compressed nor expanded, and the sound pressure is momentarily zero.
Note that A and A are times in the cycle when the particle velocity is
greatest and that B and B' are times when the velocity passes through zero
as the direction of movement reverses. In general it can be shown that for
plane sinusoidal waves the sound pressure and the particle velocity have
the same phase; that is, the sinusoids representing pressure and particle
velocity are exactly in step with one another. The sound pressure is positive
when the particles and the wave are moving in the same direction and
negative when they are in opposite directions. We will refer to this again in
Chapter 7.

Sound Waves 51
Wavefronts
The air we live in exists, of course, in three-dimensional space, and, to
imagine a sound wave properly we should picture it in three dimensions too.
As a sound wave progresses from its source, the boundary between the air
that is vibrating and the air that has yet to be disturbed is a surface. This
surface is called a wavefront. The boundary moves outwards from the source
with the speed of sound, which is about 344 ms"1. If we confine our
attention to a practically small volume, it will not be long before the sound
spreads throughout its entirety and, according to the definition just given,
the wavefront will soon have passed beyond the region of interest. The idea
of a wavefront is, however, a useful one, and it would be helpful to define
something less evanescent that exists in regions where a sound field is
already established. In pursuit of such a definition it may be observed that
the time taken for the wave to travel from the source to the wavefront is
necessarily the same at all points on the surface. It follows that the
vibrations of all sound particles at the wavefront have the same phase. We
can thus extend the definition of a wavefront by using the term to describe
any surface within a sound field at which vibrations are in phase.
Over moderate distances air is isotropicâit has the same physical
properties in all directions. The speed of sound is therefore independent of
direction except over distances of several kilometres or more. At distances
from a source that are large compared with the dimensions of the source
itself, the wavefronts are almost spherical. Moreover, at a sufficient distance
the wavefronts will appear flat, just as the earth's surface seems flat if we
look at only a small part of it. The sound waves associated with such
wavefronts are called plane progressive waves. Truly plane waves may not be
realizable, but in many circumstances it is possible to produce waves that
approximate this condition for practical purposes. Plane waves are import-
ant practically and as a theoretical abstraction because they are sound
waves in their simplest form.
Frequency, Velocity and Wavelength
We have already described frequency and velocity, and most readers will
know that wavelength is the distance between corresponding points in
successive cycles of the wave. Scientists and writers of technical glossaries
frequently strive to provide definitions that can be applied as widely as
possible. This sometimes imposes conditions which may not seem necessary
at first sight. We have hitherto used velocity (or speed) to mean the rate at

52 Acoustics for Audiologists
which a sound wave advances. There is nothing wrong with this definition
when applied to ordinary sound waves in air. In such waves the speed of
sound is quite independent of frequency. There are, however, circumstances
when the speed of a wave is not independent of frequency. Waves travelling
over the surface of water are an example. When speed depends on frequency,
the profile of a nonsinusoidal wave is not constant; instead, groups of waves
are created that travel with what is called the group velocity. This need not
be considered further but is mentioned only to show that the assumption of
a constant, frequency-independent velocity is not always valid. A careful
definition of velocity should therefore allow frequency to be specified. In the
previous chapter it was stated that complex vibrations (such as the sawtooth
vibration described earlier) can be treated as if they were composed of a
number of sinusoidal vibrations added together. Acoustical terms are often
defined in the knowledge that they may be applied to the sinusoidal
components of a vibration or wave; accordingly, the definitions specify
sinusoidal motion.
The velocity of a sinusoidal wave is best described by what is called the
phase velocity. If we think of a number of points along a line in which the
wave is advancing, the phase of the vibration at any instant at one point
will be seen at the next point a few moments later, and at the following point
later still, and so on. A 'locus' of constant phase can therefore be imagined
to be in transit, moving outwards from the origin. Its velocity is the phase
velocity. The phase velocity is therefore the velocity at which the wavefronts
travel. When describing sound waves in air, the word velocity (or speed)
almost always means the phase velocity.2 The velocity of sound is therefore
the velocity at which the wave advances into the undisturbed air or,
generally, the velocity at which wavefronts move.
It can be shown that the elastic and the inertial properties of air determine
the speed of sound: it is the square root of the ratio of the modulus of
elasticity K to the density p0.
Because air is a good insulator, the flow of heat between adjacent parts
of the sound field is usually negligible. The bulk elastic modulus has
therefore the form applicable to an adiabatic process, namely, K = yP, where
2'Speed of sound: magnitude of the phase velocity in a free progressive sound wave.' IEC
60050-(801) (1994). In air, the phase and group velocities are identical.

Sound Waves 53
P is atmospheric pressure (see Chapter 1). Therefore,
The relationship between atmospheric pressure and density is given by the
gas laws. The equation of state for an ideal gas was given in Chapter 1 as
PV = RT, where R is the universal gas constant and V is the volume of
1 mole of the gas. By changing R to a different constant R', we can make
the equation apply to a different mass, 1 kg say, so that V is now the volume
of air whose mass is a kilogram. By definition, this volume is the reciprocal
of the density, so that
From these two equations we see that the velocity of sound is independent
of atmospheric pressure because a change in pressure produces a corre-
sponding change in density. The ratio of pressure to density is therefore
constant provided the temperature remains the same. This ratio does,
however, depend on temperature, with the result that sound travels more
quickly in warm air than in cool air. In most circumstances the temperature
dependence is not very great because T is the absolute temperature and c is
proportional to its square root. For example, if the velocity of sound at 20Â°C
is 344 ms"1 then at 0Â°C it would be about 3-5% less:
The change in the speed of sound with altitude is due to the fall in
temperature with increasing height above the earth's surface, as shown in
Table 1.1.
The wavelength of sound in a sinusoidal progressive wave can now be
defined as the distance between two wavefronts in which vibrations differ in
phase by one complete cycle. A complete cycle corresponds, of course, to a
phase change of 2n radians or 360Â°. Wavelength is usually represented in
formulae by the letter lambda (/I).
If a sinusoidal progressive wave is produced by a source whose frequency
is / Hz, then / cycles are completed in 1 second and during each cycle the
wave advances by a distance equal to one wavelength. The velocity,
frequency, and wavelength in a sinusoidal wave are therefore very simply
related:

54 Acoustics for Audiologists
that is,
Frequency, the number of cycles per second, is the reciprocal of the
duration of each cycle, that is, the reciprocal of the period, T. Therefore,
We also write the velocity in terms of angular frequency co as follows:
where k = 2n/l and co = 2nf. The constant k is called the phase-change
coefficient or wavelength constant. If the wave is 'frozen' at an instant so that
the particle displacement is seen as a function of position, this coefficient is
the rate at which phase changes with distance from the source. Angular
frequency, on the other hand, is the rate of change of phase with time when
vibrations are observed at a given place.3
Particle Displacement and Velocity in
Sinusoidal Waves
It was stated earlier that for any wave travelling in a specified direction the
particle displacement depends on ct â x (Equation 3.1). Here, for the sake
of argument, we are making the x-axis the direction in which the wave is
moving. The wave advances in the positive x-direction, that is, from left to
right as x increases. Now, ct and x are distances â you could measure them
in metres â whereas a sine function requires an angle for its argument.
Multiplying (ctâx) by the phase-change coefficient 2n/A converts the
distance to an angle in such a way that its sine has the required periodicity.
The particle displacement can then be expressed as
3The constants k and at are important and frequently used. The reader should take care to
understand and remember their definitions. In this text k has been called the phase-change
coefficient. This name for 2n/A or ca/c is usually introduced in the context of the propagation
and attenuation of sound or electromagnetic waves in ducts and transmission lines. Other
names are wavelength coefficient, wavelength constant, and phase constant. The name wave
number also appears, but in other branches of science (notably spectroscopy), wave number
means 1/A, not 2n/L

Sound Waves 55
where a is the displacement amplitude, that is, the greatest particle displace-
ment during the cycle.4
Alternative forms of this equation are
and
The particle velocity at a given location jc is the rate at which particle
displacement changes with time. Particle velocity u is given by
There are two important things to notice here. The first is that if the
displacement amplitude is a, then the velocity amplitude up is coa; the second
is that the particle velocity leads the displacement by a quarter-cycle, that
is, by Ti/2 radians or 90Â°. Recall that sin(0 + n/2) = cos 9 and see Figure 3.6.
Sound Pressure, Particle Velocity,
and Energy
It can be shown that in plane sinusoidal waves the sound pressure is directly
proportional to the particle velocity. The constant of proportionality is pQc,
where p0 is the density of air.5 This important constant is called the
characteristic impedance of air. We will meet it again in Chapter 7. The
relationship between sound pressure and particle velocity can therefore be

Earlier in this chapter we referred to the importance of the air's elastic
compressibility and its inertia in the production of a sound wave. Compres-
sion and expansion of the air during each cycle of a sound vibration creates
a temporary store of potential energy that is available for transmission in
the wave until the sound pressure returns to zero. A corresponding kinetic

here and in the corresponding equations. A more general expression would include 0 or be
written as Â£, = a sm(2n/fy(ct â x) + b cos(2n/X)(ct â x).
5The density p0 is the density of air that is undisturbed by the presence of sound. It is therefore
the density at the static atmospheric pressure. The subscript is usually added to distinguish
this density from the alternating component of density in a sound field.

energy is associated with the particle velocity. The stored elastic energy Ep
per unit volume at any point in the sound field is 1 x (stress)2 -f- modulus
(see Chapter 1), where the stress is the sound pressure. We can therefore
write this algebraically as
Kinetic energy is 1 x mass x (speed)2, so that the kinetic energy Ek per unit
volume is the density x the square of the particle velocity, that is,
With some simple algebra and the relationships given in Equations 3.2
and 3.4, it can be shown that the kinetic and potential energies are at all
times equal at a given point in the sound field. The total energy per unit

Sound Waves 57
volume is given by
The energy E in unit volume is called the sound energy density. In this
expression the sound pressure p and the particle velocity u are the instan-
taneous values of these variables. The energy density in a plane sinusoidal
wave is therefore itself a fluctuating quantity. Seen as either a function of
time or position, its variation is the square of a sine function (Figure 3.7).
There is an interesting contrast here between the energies in a sound wave
and those in the simple harmonic oscillator described in the previous
chapter. In the sound wave, as in the oscillator, the average potential energy
is equal to the average kinetic energy, but in the oscillator these energies are
constantly exchanged so that their sum is unchanging throughout the cycle.
In acoustics we often want to describe varying quantities such as energy
density, sound pressure, and so on in terms of their average values. The
average is usually required at a given location in the sound field and is made
over a specified time. The measurements commonly made with a sound-level
meter are time averages at the point where the microphone is located.
Averages could in principle also be made at a given instant over a specified
distance in a given direction. At the end of Chapter 2 attention was drawn
to the importance of root mean square values. The average energy density
in plane sinusoidal waves is given by
FIG. 3.7 Sound pressure and sound energy per unit volume.

58 Acoustics for Audiologists
The average sound energy density is an important quantity in so far as the
indication on a sound-level meter is directly related to its magnitude
expressed in decibels. Readers are reminded that because we are dealing
with sinusoidal waves the root mean square values can be obtained from the
pressure and velocity amplitudes by dividing by root 2. It is important to
notice that in all the preceding expressions the energy is independent of
frequency when it is given in terms of sound pressure or particle velocity. A
given pressure level registered on a sound-level meter corresponds to the
same acoustic energy per cubic metre, regardless of frequency.
The sound energy flux is the sound energy flowing per second in a
specified direction through a specified area, and sound intensity is the sound
energy flux per unit area. We would usually be interested in the sound
intensity in the direction along which the wave is progressing, and in the
following text this direction should be assumed unless it is stated otherwise.
The idea of 'energy flow', though found occasionally in scientific writing and
frequently in writing that has nothing to do with science, is apt to be
imprecise, and an explanation of its meaning in the present context is
appropriate. We have just seen that the air in a sound field possesses
potential and kinetic energy that it would not have if left undisturbed. As a
sound wave advances, energy is therefore acquired by the air in regions
hitherto undisturbed. Moreover, whenever sound encounters some object or
boundary, some of its energy is absorbed and converted to a nonacoustic
form (ultimately heat). So we can imagine energy to be 'carried' from the
source to other places and to other objects. The 'flow of energy' (the flux)
is the amount of energy so transported every second.
A sound wave advances a distance numerically equal to its velocity c in
1 second, so that an area of 1 m2 in the wavefront sweeps out a volume
numerically equal to c m3 in the same time. The average energy contained
in this volume is therefore equal to Eav x c. This energy has been supplied
by sound passing through a unit area and is, by definition, the sound
intensity, /. Multiplying throughout Equation 3.5 by c gives the acoustic
intensity as
There is a useful comparison to be made between acoustic and electrical
quantities. This will be described in more detail in Chapter 7, but it is
mentioned here because the formulae for simple electrical circuits are well
known and the analogy is helpful in understanding Equation 3.6. Sound
pressure and particle velocity are analogous to voltage and current, and the
characteristic impedance pQc is analogous to electrical resistance. The

Sound Waves 59
expression for acoustic intensity given in Equation 3.6 therefore corresponds
to the expression for the heat generated by an electric current in a resistance
(see Chapter 1). In the electrical case, energy provided by the source of the
electricity is dissipated in the resistor; in the acoustic case, sound energy
provided by the source is dissipated in the sound field as just described.
Numerical Example: Magnitudes of Acoustic
Quantities in a Plane Wave
In the foregoing paragraphs we have looked at the anatomy of a sound wave
in some detail, so it may be helpful to form an impression of the magnitudes
of the physical variables involved, taking as an example sound as it might
exist in a real situation. We assume that the formulae applicable to plane
sinusoidal waves are a sufficient approximation to the reality. Suppose we
are talking about a sound that would register on a meter as 80 dB SPL.
Although the meaning of the decibel scale has not yet been explained, most
people will know that 80 dB is quite a significant sound level, perhaps near
the lower end of the range for much disco or rock band music. The rms
sound pressure at this level is 0-2 Pa.
Particle Velocity and Displacement
The characteristic impedance of air at 20Â°C is 414 Nsm~3, so the particle
velocity corresponding to a sound pressure of 0-2 Pa must be 0-2/414 =
4-8 x 10~4 ms"1, a speed readily exceeded by the average garden snail.
To find the corresponding particle displacement, we have to nominate a
frequencyâlet's make it 1 kHzâand divide the velocity by the angular
frequency. The particle displacement at 1 kHz is therefore 4-8 x 10~4/2 x
n x 1000 = 7-7 x 10"8 m.
It is interesting to compare the rms particle velocity just calculated with
that of the air molecules. It can be shown that the molecules of a gas have
an rms speed cm that is directly related to the speed of sound c by
where y is the ratio of the principal specific heats, which for air is 1-40. The
speed of sound at 20Â° C is 344 ms-1, so the rms speed of air molecules is
344 x /(3/l-4) = 504 ms-1. This is about one million times greater than the
sound particle velocity just calculated.

60 Acoustics for Audiologists
Sound Intensity and Energy Density
Substituting in Equation 3.6 gives the sound intensity as I = (0-2)2/414 =
9-7 x 10-5 Wm-2, that is, about 100 //W per m2. With the acoustic power
coming through a window 1 metre square, all collected and turned to heat,
it would take 33 years to boil enough water for a cup of tea.
The energy density for the same sound is I/c = 9.7 x 10-5/344 = 3 x 10-7
Jm-3. In a large room (1000 m3), the total sound energy at any one time
would therefore be 3 x 10-4 J. This is the energy you would get from a
100-watt lamp after 3 us.
When we think about sound waves and attempt to describe them as we
have done so far in this chapter, we are likely to imagine the air to be in a
state of vigorous agitation. It is certainly true that the particles oscillate
rapidly, for they do so at the same frequency as the sound, but it may come
as a surprise to find just how small the movements are at all ordinary sound
levels and how little energy is involved. One might think that the bombard-
ment of the eardrum by immense numbers of air molecules travelling at
supersonic speeds would raise a cacophony that would completely obscure
the feeble acoustic vibrations, but in fact the thermal noise from air
molecules colliding with the eardrum is all but inaudible. Although random
molecular collisions are responsible for the static air pressure, which is vastly
greater than any conceivable sound pressure, it requires a change in pressure
averaged over the whole surface of the eardrum to generate an audible
sound. Molecular collisions are haphazard, and fluctuations in the average
pressure necessarily occur. But the number of collisions is beyond imagin-
ation (=1023 per square cm per second) so that the average static pressure
is highly stable and its variation at audio frequencies is below the level of
audible sound.
We have illustrated here what small magnitudes sound vibrations can
have. It would, however, be a mistake to assume that particle displacements
and velocities are always so minute. They can be several orders of magni-
tude greater near to a source, particularly if its dimensions are small
compared with the wavelength. At low frequencies the movement of the
diaphragm of a loudspeaker, for example, may be large enough to be clearly
visible.
Combining Sound Waves
Suppose sounds are coming from two sources so that the waves from one
mix with the waves from the other. An important feature of sound
propagation is that when two sounds are combined, the particle displace-

Sound Waves 61
ment is the sum of the displacements due to each source acting alone, that is,
The law that allows the addition of components due to each wave is called
the principle of superposition.6 It is valid for other physical quantities, such
as particle velocity and sound pressure, that are linearly related (simply
proportional) to displacement. It should be noted that in general the particle
displacements, velocities, and so forth are not in the same direction because
they are related to waves that are travelling in different directions; therefore,
they must be added as vectors. They are also, of course, functions of time,
frequency, and location in the wave. The addition may therefore be a little
complicated even if the principle is a simple one. A wonderful consequence
of the principle of superposition is that when waves travelling in different
directions meet, each continues on its way unaffected by the other. This may
not be obvious for sound waves because we are usually unaware of the
existence of individual wave trains. Usually we are in the region where the
waves mix and we hear only the combination (though we can often identify
or 'listen in' to the individual sources). With light waves the principle is
more evident: a beam of light from a torch is quite unaffected if it is
intersected by a beam from another torch.
Interference
Where waves of the same frequency from different sources are combined,
their superposition will generally give rise to a vibration whose amplitude
is different from that due to each component acting alone. The process
whereby the amplitude of vibrations varies from one locality to another in
a sound field because waves have been combined is called interference. It
often happens that the variation in amplitude is so distributed as to create
a regular pattern called an interference pattern. This is a well-known
phenomenon in optics (Figure 3.8), and readers may find it helpful to refer
to elementary books on light to find examples. An important special case
concerns the superposition of two waves having the same frequency and
amplitude. If each wave is associated with a vibration of amplitude a, then
their combination must produce an amplitude somewhere between 0 and 2a
depending on whether vibrations have the same phase and reinforce one
another or have opposite phases and cancel each other. The former is called
constructive interference and the latter destructive interference. The colours
seen when water is coated with a thin film of oil provide an example of
6Attributed to Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695).

destructive interference in which, for certain wavelengths, light reflected
from the oil-water boundary arrives at the surface in antiphase with the
incident light. The perceived colour is that of white light minus the colour
removed by the cancellation.
Standing Waves
When two sound waves of the same frequency and similar amplitudes but
travelling in opposite directions combine, they produce a special interference
pattern called a standing wave. The pattern consists of periodic variation in
amplitude arising from alternate constructive and destructive interference

Sound Waves 63
along the path of the individual waves. Standing waves are easily created
(often unintentionally) whenever sound is reflected back towards its source
by, for example, a wall, a person, or an object in the sound field. It is
important to know something of the mechanisms underlying the formation
of these waves because of their potential to cause serious error in acoustic
measurements. The problem is a particular concern in audiometric pro-
cedures such as sound field audiometry, where the source is at some distance
from the ear.
Figure 3.9 shows two plane progressive waves of equal amplitude and a
standing wave formed by their combination. In this example the waves are
shown as sound particle displacements at a given instant. The displacements
are sine functions varying with position on the x-axis, which has been drawn
in the direction of travel of wave 1. Wave 2 travels in the opposite direction.
The sum of the vibrations of waves 1 and 2 is shown by the solid-line
sinusoid at the bottom of the diagram. This is the standing wave. At
successive instants the whole wave train labelled wave 1 moves to the right
while the train labelled wave 2 moves to the left. The interference pattern,

in opposite directions.

64 Acoustics for Audiologists

however, remains stationaryâits sinusoidal pattern does not move along
the x-axis. The fact that a stationary wave is created by the addition of two
moving waves is illustrated in Figure 3.10, which shows wave 1 and wave 2
and the sum of these vibrations at 10 successive instants in the cycle. A place
in an interference pattern where the amplitude of vibration is zero (or at
least has a minimum value) is called a node, and a place where the amplitude
is a maximum is called an antinode. If, as is generally the case, destructive
interference at a node is incomplete, so that a minimum rather than a zero
occurs, the node may be described as partial. The distance between two
successive nodes or two successive antinodes is equal to half the wavelength.
Corresponding to the characteristic that is locally zero, we can distinguish
different types of nodes (and antinodes), namely, displacement node, velocity
node, pressure node, and so on.
In diagrams that represent standing waves, it is often helpful to draw two
curves that together show the wave envelope. Following the usual conven-

Sound Waves 65
tion, dependent variables such as pressure and displacement are displayed
vertically while position is shown horizontally. The wave envelope defines,
at any given place, the positive and negative limits of vibration, namely, plus
and minus the amplitude of the vibration in the standing wave. The
envelope therefore consists of a series of 'loops' connecting the nodal points.
The antinodes occur at the widest part of each loop.
The creation of the standing wave from the superposition of progressive
waves travelling in opposite directions can be demonstrated mathematically
as follows. For wave 1 running in the positive x-direction, the particle
displacement E1 is, as in Equation 3.3
while for wave 2 running in the opposite direction it is
where O is an arbitrary phase angle. It is easily shown that these sinusoids
add to give
The magic of this is that x and t are no longer both part of the same sine
function but instead are split so that the variation with time is given by one
function (the sine term) while the variation with distance is given by a
second function (the cosine term). The terms preceding the sine provide the
amplitude of the sine function, and this amplitude varies with x. The
variation defines the pattern of the standing wave. The displacement and
velocity nodes occur wherever the cosine term is zero, that is, wherever the
angle kx + (j)/2 is an odd multiple of Â± n/2. The distance between nodes is
therefore equal to half the wavelength of the two superimposed waves. The
antinodes are found midway between successive nodes, where the cosine
term is equal to plus or minus 1. The greatest amplitude in the standing
wave is therefore 2a. It may be noticed that the standing wave exists
regardless of the relative phase of the two waves that create it. Changing $
moves the pattern along the x-axis but leaves it otherwise unaltered. It may
also be remarked that if the parent waves do not have the same amplitude,
they nevertheless produce a stationary interference pattern, but of course
destructive interference is then incomplete and only partial nodes are to be
found.
An interesting property of a standing wave formed from two waves of
equal amplitude is that in the region between two adjacent nodes the
particles all move in the same direction at any given time. The vibrations
have different amplitudes, of course, according to their location on the
x-axis, but they have the same phase; that is, they move in step with one

another. In contrast, particles on either side of a node move in opposite
directions (Figure 3.11). If the parent waves have different amplitudes, there
is a progressive phase change between adjacent partial nodes. The rate of
change of phase with x is nonuniform and is more rapid near the nodes than
elsewhere. For the equal-amplitude condition it is instantaneous.
Earlier in this chapter it was stated that the sound pressure in a plane
sinusoidal progressive wave is proportional to particle velocity (page 55).
We might therefore expect to find that the sound pressure in a standing
wave is least at the displacement or velocity nodes where the air is
permanently at rest because destructive interference has cancelled the sound
vibrations; correspondingly, we might have anticipated that the greatest
pressure would be found at the antinodes. It may therefore come as a
surprise to find that in the standing waves just described the sound pressure
is greatest at the nodal points. In other words, the velocity nodes coincide
with the pressure antinodes. This may not seem such a paradox when we
remember that the particles on either side of a node are alternately
converging towards the node and diverging from it in successive half-cycles.
A further explanation is provided in Figure 3.12. The top diagram provides
a snapshot of a sound wave and shows its pressure waveform as a function
of distance. The direction in which the wave is moving is shown by the
arrow on the axis; the direction in which the sound particles are moving is
shown by the arrows at the maxima and minima, which are labelled P+ and

P_ according to whether the sound pressure is positive or negative at the
instant of observation. Now mentally make a copy of wave 1, invert it left
to right as a mirror image, and place it beneath the original to create
wave 2 as shown. The particle velocities are clearly reversed in this process,
but the pressures are not. This is because pressure is directionless, and
whether it is positive or negative (greater or less than atmospheric pressure)
depends on whether the particle velocity is in the direction of propagation
of the wave or opposed to it. The reflection reverses both the velocity and
the direction of the wave. As a consequence, sound pressure and particle
velocity are in phase in wave 1 and in antiphase in wave 2. When the waves
combine they produce the pattern of nodes and antinodes shown in the
bottom diagram. Pressure antinodes occur at places where the peaks and
troughs in the pressure waveform of wave 1 line up momentarily with the
corresponding peaks and troughs in wave 2. At these points the particle
velocities (shown by the arrows) are in opposite directions. The velocities
therefore cancel. To locate the velocity antinodes we must find where waves
1 and 2 will be when the velocities are in the same direction. One-quarter
of a cycle after the moment captured in the top diagram, wave 1 will have
moved to the right and wave 2 to the left. The pressure peaks in wave 1 and

68 Acoustics for Audiologists
the pressure troughs in wave 2 will then be aligned over the pressure nodes,
but at these points it can be seen that the particle velocities are in the same
direction. They therefore reinforce to create velocity antinodes.
Standing Waves in Pipes
The relevance of this subject to audiology is, of course, that the external ear
is as a first approximation the acoustic equivalent of a pipe. It is closed at
one end by the tympanic membrane, which, despite the best efforts of the
middle ear transformer, is a considerable impediment to the transmission of
sound. A further audiological interest is that pipes (plastic tubes) are used
to couple hearing aids to earmoulds, and fine-bore tubes are used to convey
sound to probe microphones. In order to give a simple account of the
transmission of sound in pipes, it is necessary to place some restriction on
the type of pipe to be considered. It will be assumed that the pipe is a
cylinder with rigid walls, either open at both ends or closed at one end by
a flat, rigid surface. The diameter of the pipe has to be small compared with
its length and small compared with the wavelength of sound, but not so
small that sound is attenuated through energy loss due to the viscosity of
the air. Attenuation is important in tubes used for probe microphones, but
its influence on the acoustics of hearing aid tubes is small except when
porous elements (filters) are inserted.
The progress of a sound wave in a uniform pipe is much the same as that
of a plane wave in free air, but the ends of the pipe, whether open or closed,
are discontinuities that cause the sound to be reflected back into the pipe,
where the superposition of the incident and reflected waves creates a
standing wave according to the principles already discussed. Two kinds of
reflection are possible. At a closed end the particle displacement and particle
velocity at the solid surface are necessarily zero and the standing wave must
therefore have a velocity node at this point. The node is created by the
reversal of the particle velocity at the reflection so that the reflected wave is
initiated with particle velocities in antiphase with those in the incident wave.
The phase of the pressure, however, is not reversed. At the closed end there
is therefore a pressure antinode in which the pressure is double that in the
incident wave. When sound is reflected from the open end of a pipe, exactly
the opposite is true. At the opening the sudden absence of confinement
allows the emerging sound wave to expand into the surrounding air to
create a spherical wave. The divergence is accompanied by a sudden fall in
sound pressure and an increase in the particle velocity. Superposition of an
emerging wave with its reflection from the open end creates a pressure node
and a velocity antinode at the opening. Reflection from an open end of a

Sound Waves 69
pipe reverses the phase of the sound pressure but leaves the phase of the
particle velocity unchanged.
If a stable wave system is to be maintained within a pipe, two things are
necessary. The first is that the wavelength of the sound must be such that
the standing wave pattern matches the length of the pipe, placing a velocity
node at a closed end and an antinode at an open end. The second
requirement is that sound energy radiated from an open end must be
replaced. This is possible if the pipe receives energy directly from a sound
source within it or indirectly from the external sound field. The energy
supply must have the same frequency as that of the standing wave. This is
an example of resonance. In addition to the nodes or antinodes at the ends
of the pipe, there may also be similar nodes and antinodes within the pipe.
For a given pipe, there will exist a series of possible standing wave patterns,
each with a different number of nodes depending on the resonance fre-
quency. A given pattern is called a mode of vibration. The wavelength
becomes shorter and the frequency increases with the number of nodes. The
lowest possible frequency is called the fundamental frequency. Frequencies
for the other modes are multiples of the fundamental.
Figure 3.13 shows the possible standing wave patterns for resonance in
closed and open pipes. If the pipe is closed, its length must be an odd
FIG. 3.13 
Modes of vibration in closed and open pipes.

70 Acoustics for Audiologists
number of quarter waves. Allowable frequencies are therefore f, 3f, 5f, and
so on, where f = c/A = c/4L for a pipe whose length is L. A pipe open at
both ends must contain an even number of quarter wavelengths or, to put
it another way, any integral number of half wavelengths. Resonances are
therefore possible at frequencies f, 2f, 3f, 4f, and so on, where f = c/2L.
Frequencies that form a series of the kind just described are called
harmonics. The lowest frequency (the fundamental) is called the first
harmonic, the next frequency in the series is the second harmonic, and so on.
The vibrations of a closed pipe contain only odd harmonics, while those of
an open pipe comprise a full harmonic series. The harmonic series is a
special case of something more general. Most vibrating systems are capable
of vibrating in different modes with increasing frequency above the funda-
mental. In many cases the various modes can be excited simultaneously to
produce what is called a complex tone made up of several or many
frequencies. The component pure tones are called partials. Partials other
than the fundamental are called overtones. They are not necessarily integer
multiples of the lowest frequency. For example, the vibrations of a free metal
bar7 form the series f, 2-76f, 540f 8-93f, and so on. It will be seen from these
definitions that in an harmonic series the second harmonic is the first
overtone, and so on. This may sometimes be slightly confusing, especially in
the context of musical sounds, because musicians often regard the words
overtone and harmonic as synonyms.
Standing Waves in Strings
The vibration of a stretched string is well known to most people. It is the
basis of numerous musical instruments, including those in the violin family,
the guitar, and the piano. Such instruments are certainly not intended to
produce pure tones, and much craftsmanship is devoted to the creation of
that pleasing blend of partials that delights the ear. In each case the
vibrations of the string and, more important, the vibrations of the instru-
ment as a whole are complex and very difficult to analyse and to explain.
Some general observations can nevertheless be made. Usually, after an
initial transient at the onset of bowing or plucking or striking with a
hammer, the string settles into a more or less steady condition in which
standing waves are formed between the bridge and the stopped end (violin
and guitar) or between bridgelike fixtures near the extremities (piano). The
strings of a piano possess relatively great energy, and their vibrations die
7A tuning fork is an example of a free bar. The U-bend and the stem are complications. If the
fork is struck carefully, the fundamental dominates and the sound is quite pure. Striking the
fork violently creates audible overtones.

Sound Waves 71
away quite slowly. The vibrations of a guitar decay more rapidly and those
of a violin even more so, but the sound of a violin is normally maintained
by bowing, which produces a complex sawtooth vibration in which the
string is alternately pulled and released by the bow.
Because by their nature strings are very long compared with their
diameter, the only vibrations that matter are those perpendicular to the
string itself, and waves travelling along a string are transverse waves. Such
waves are intuitively easier to understand than the longitudinal waves that
we have described hitherto. In its simplest form the string is assumed to have
negligible stiffnessâif it were removed from the instrument it could be bent
easily. In use, the string is of course stretched and under considerable
tension (sometimes almost to breaking point). Any transverse displacement
that alters the shape of the string locally gives rise to a transverse
component of the stretching force directed towards the equilibrium position.
The force is proportional to the displacement, provided it is small enough.
The situation is therefore similar to that in the harmonic oscillator described
in the previous chapter. It is found that the velocity of the transverse wave
is almost independent of frequency but increases with the square root of the
tension and decreases with the square root of the mass per unit length of
the string. Therefore,
where T is the tension and m the mass per unit length.
The standing wave pattern must, of course, have velocity nodes at the
fixed ends of the stringâfor example, at the fingerboard and the bridge of
a violin. The pattern is therefore analogous to that of a standing wave in a
pipe closed at both ends (a condition not included in the previous section).
A wave travelling towards a node is reflected in the reverse phase so that
the distance between nodes must be an integral number of half wavelengths.
This gives rise to the full harmonic series f, 2f, 3f, 5f, and so on, where
/ = c/2L (Figure 3.14).
It is evident that the fundamental frequency is given by
. which may be rearranged to show the ratio of the tension to the mass per
unit length of the string as

72 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 3.14 
Modes of transverse vibration on a string.
In musical instruments, energy is needed to produce a strong, sustained
note. It is intuitively obvious that a taut, massive string has more vibrational
energy than a slack, light one. The length and frequency of a string are
determined by the size of the instrument and the musical note that is
required of the string in the 'open' or unstopped condition. The ratio of
tension to mass is therefore fixed for a particular string, but both tension
and mass have to be high if vibrations are to have adequate energy. The
tension is limited by the strength of the string and of the instrument itself.
It is usually necessary to increase the mass of the bass strings by wrapping
them with wire or other material. Simply increasing their diameter would
produce an undesirable stiffness and would have the further disadvantage of
making them difficult to attach.
Beats
So far in this chapter we have considered the addition of vibrations that
have exactly the same frequency. Suppose we allow the frequencies to differ.
Imagine then that we observe vibrations at a point in the combined field of
two sources such that the vibrations due to each source acting singly differ
in frequency and amplitude. Because one cycle repeats more rapidly than
the other, the two vibrations differ progressively in their relative phase.
There will be times when the component vibrations are more or less in step
with each other so that they reinforce, and times when they will be out of
step and partially cancel. In general the combination can produce a
vibration that is quite complicated. The waveform is not a simple sinusoid,

73

and it may even be aperiodic in the sense that it has no recurring pattern.
But an important special case exists when the frequencies differ by just a
small amount. In these circumstances the rate of change of phase is very
small, so that the more rapid vibration 'overtakes' the other only gradually.
Their superposition then gives an almost sinusoidal vibration whose fre-
quency is the average of the component frequencies and whose amplitude
varies slowly between the sum and the difference of the component ampli-
tudes. The word beats is used to describe this phenomenon, the beat
frequency being the rate at which the amplitude maxima recur (Figure 3.15).
The beat frequency is equal to the difference between the frequencies of the
two original vibrations.
The way that beats are produced can perhaps be understood more easily
if presented mathematically.8 For simplicity we will assume that the vibra-
tions have the same amplitude, and, as we have done previously, we omit
arbitrary phase angles. Our two component vibrations at frequencies fÂ± and

where coi = 2nf1 and co2 = 2nf2. The vibrations add to give
where
It will be seen in Equation 3.7 that the sine term has the average frequency
of the original vibrations. When the difference between the two frequencies
is small, the cosine term changes slowly to give a slow change in the
amplitude r of the sine term. The least value of r is zero and the greatest
value is 2a, that is, twice the amplitude of the components. If the original
amplitudes are unequalâa and b, say â then Equation 3.7 is more compli-
cated, but the general principle is the same: the amplitude changes slowly
from a + b to a â b. Beats are, not surprisingly, more readily audible if these
amplitudes are nearly equal so that the contrast between their sum and
difference is enhanced.
We have described beats as occurring slowly simply to convey the idea
that the compound wave can be treated as a single-frequency sinusoid with
a variable amplitude. The word slow, however, is a relative term, implying
only that the beat frequency is much less than the frequency of the primary
tones. If the beat frequency is high enough it may have a tonal quality,
giving the auditory illusion that the complex contains a vibration whose
frequency is equal to the beat frequency. This has important implications for
theories of hearing because, despite appearances to the contrary, there is no
acoustic energy at the average and difference frequencies. This point is
perhaps a little difficult to understand, particularly as Equation 3.7 clearly
has these average and difference terms. What it means is this: if the complex
vibration is analysed with a microphone together with an electronic filter
that admits only a narrow range of frequencies, sound would be detected
with the filter tuned to either of the two primary frequencies, but nothing at
all would be detected with the filter tuned to the average frequency or to the
difference frequency. The fact that the ear can perceive a tone whose pitch
corresponds to the beat frequency implies that the ear can, in some
circumstances, hear sounds whose frequencies are not present in the external
environment.
We will consider the analysis of complex sounds in Chapter 5, but for now
it is worth stating that when a sound is said to 'contain' or 'comprise' certain

Sound Waves 75
frequencies it usually means that the waveform can be synthesised by the
addition of sinusoids having these frequencies. On this account there can be
only two frequencies 'contained' in the two-tone complex that gives rise to
beats as just described. It should be noted, however, that the principle of
superposition that we have assumed applies only to linear systems in which,
for example, sound pressure and sound particle velocity are directly propor-
tional to one another. An important case where linearity cannot be assumed
is the ear itselfâthe displacement of the basilar membrane at a given
frequency is not simply proportional to the sound pressure in the external
field. The nonlinearity produces vibrations of the basilar membrane at
frequencies not present in the sound field. This is an example of what is
called intermodulation distortion, which we will consider in Chapter 5.
Diffraction
Diffraction or 'bending' of sound by objects in a sound field is an almost
universal phenomenon that influences the sound arriving at our ears and the
way we perceive it. An acquaintance with this part of acoustics is therefore
an essential part of audiology.
It is not easy to give a concise definition of diffraction that covers all
possibilities. Here is a rather lengthy explanation taken from a former
British Standard:
When a sound source radiates into a medium containing any irregularity,
boundary, or inhomogeneity, the difference in sound pressure observed at any
point in the field compared with that which would occur in an infinite
homogeneous medium can be described generally as due to diffraction
processes.
In a more restricted sense 'diffraction' is the name given to the disturbance of
the sound field due to an object, within a distance of a few wavelengths from
the object. Reflection and refraction are special cases of diffraction; reflection
occurs when a wavefront, impinging on a boundary between two media, is
changed in direction within the first medium; Refraction occurs when the
wavefront passes into the second medium; by extension the term 'refraction'
includes a progressive change of the direction of the wave normal due to a
space gradient of phase velocity caused, for example, by an ordered in-
homogeneity in the medium. Scattering [is the name given to] the combined
effects of diffraction from an irregular array of objects, and is generally
expressed in terms of its average effect at a large distance from the objects.9

been withdrawn.

76 Acoustics for Audiologists
Most of this definition is clear enough, but the technical language in the last
two sentences may need some explanation. The 'wave normal' is the
direction in which the sound is travelling, and although a 'space gradient of
phase velocity' would not seem out of place in a work of science fiction,
what it means here is a change in the velocity of sound between one place
and another. An obvious example is the change in the speed of sound with
altitude in the atmosphere. The gradient in velocity causes the path of the
sound to deviate from a straight lineâan example of refraction.
At a large distance, the combined effects of diffraction, referred to as
scattering in this quotation, are more familiar in optics than in acoustics.
For example, the halo that can often be seen around the moon or other
distant source is caused by the diffraction of light by water droplets or ice
particles in the atmosphere. Similar phenomena occur in acoustics but they
are seldom obvious. We will consider reflection and refraction later under
separate headings, but for now it may be noted that although they are
special cases of diffraction, we normally use these terms in a fairly restricted
sense. Reflection usually refers to the change in the path of a sound wave
when it encounters an extensive boundary such as the wall of a room or the
side of a building. The corresponding circumstance of the refraction of sound
as it passes across a boundary is not part of everyday experience if only
because we exist in only one medium â air. Refraction by a gradient in
atmospheric conditions rather than a boundary is a far more common
observation. When we think of reflection or refraction of sound, we often
imagine the sound to be transmitted in rays, analogous to rays of light. A
ray is the direction in which energy flows; it is the direction in which a point
on the wavefront is travelling. Reflection and refraction can therefore be
shown geometrically by a ray diagram that does not require knowledge of
the frequency or wavelength. This representation fails when the sound field
is disturbed by objects that are not very large compared with the wavelength
or, for large objects, when we are interested in effects close to some
discontinuity such as an edge or an opening. Here the wave properties are
all-important. We need a word to describe such influences on the sound
field, and it is provided by diffraction in this restricted but frequently used
meaning.
The importance of diffraction in acoustics is apparent when we compare
the propagation of light with that of sound. It is almost axiomatic that light
travels in straight lines and that objects cast well-defined shadows. Sound,
on the other hand, is seemingly unhindered by most objects, so that it is
difficult to create a sound shadow even when such a thing would be
desirable as a means of blocking unwanted noise. The reason for this
difference is apparent when we compare the wavelengths of light and sound.
The wavelength of light in the centre of the visible spectrum (green) is about

Sound Waves 77
5-3 x 10-7 metres (530 nm). This is a million times smaller than the
wavelength of sound at 640 Hz. Sound travels at about 344 metres per
second or 344 millimetres per millisecond. The period of a 1-kHz tone is
1 ms, so the wavelength at this frequency is 344 mm (about 13-5 inches).
Even at 20 kHz, the conventional upper limit of audibility, the wavelength
is 17 mm. It follows that the wavelength of sound is seldom negligible
compared with the size of ordinary objects in the way that the wavelength
of light is. We shall therefore find diffraction phenomena to be important
throughout acoustics.
The problem of calculating the disturbance caused by an object in the
path of a sound wave is a difficult one, and analytical solutions are available
only for a small number of special cases. There are, however, some general
principles that give a valuable insight into the way diffraction comes about.
Foremost among these is Huygens' principle, which provides an elegant and
intuitively simple method of constructing the new wavefront after diffraction
has occurred. According to this principle, all points on a wavefront can be
thought of as sources of 'secondary' waves: the envelope of the secondary
waves is the new wavefront (Figure 3.16). The vibration at a point outside
the wavefront can, in principle, be obtained from the superposition of the
vibrations at that point arising from the secondary sources. These vibrations
differ in amplitude and phase according to the distance from the wavefront;
thus, superposition requires more than simple addition. Vector addition is
required, in which the contribution from each secondary source has a
magnitude corresponding to the amplitude of vibration and a direction
corresponding to its phase. A wavefront is, of course, a continuous surface
containing an infinite number of secondary sources, and the superposition
therefore involves the addition of an infinite number of terms. This may
seem an infinitely difficult problem, but in fact there are some fairly simple
mathematical procedures that can provide solutions in particular circum-
stances. An example is shown in Figure 3.17 for diffraction by an edge. The

edge, which is straight, runs perpendicular to the page. It forms the top of
an obstruction, a solid wall, in the path of a cylindrical or plane wave.
Sound is scattered above the wall and below it into the geometrical shadow
as shown. The variation of sound intensity with height above and below the
edge is shown by the graph. This variation would be observed in a vertical
plane at a horizontal distance of 2 metres from the wall.
The diffraction of sound by solid objects is important in physiological
acoustics and in the measurement of sound: diffraction by the head and the
body modifies the sound field at the entrance to the ear canal; diffraction by

Sound Waves 79
the microphone itself modifies the sound field being measured. The surface
of a small solid object reflects the incident sound in all directions, so that
the sound is said to be scattered by the object. The scattering depends on
the size of the object in relation to the wavelength of the sound. Specifically,
the ratio of the amplitude of the scattered sound in a given direction to the
amplitude of the incident sound is proportional to the volume V of the
scattering object and inversely proportional to the square of the wavelength
/I and the distance r from the object; that is,
or, in terms of intensity,
It is well known in optics that the intensity of light scattered by minute
particles is proportional to 1/y4. It is for this reason that the sky, which we
see as scattered light, appears blue. The shorter wavelength dominates.
Sunsets are red because we see light directly from the sun or its reflection in
the clouds. Dust particles selectively scatter the short-wavelength light so
that the residue is more or less white light minus blue. It appears red. In
acoustics, a complex sound reflected by small objects is richer in the
high-frequency components than the incident sound. Correspondingly, scat-
tering objects between the source and the observer preferentially remove the
high-frequency components.
Diffraction of sound by the human head and torso is well known to
audiologists. The influence of the head on a previously undisturbed field is
illustrated in Figure 3.18, but it will be seen that other factorsâparticularly
ear canal resonanceâhave a more important bearing on the sound pressure
at the eardrum. It is worth noting in relation to acoustic measurement that
the sound pressure close to a very small object is almost the same as that
in the undisturbed field. At the other extreme, where the object is large
compared with the wavelength, the sound pressure is doubled at the
reflecting surface. This is similar to the pressure doubling at the closed end
of a pipe (page 68). It occurs also at the human head if the frequency is
sufficiently high. The importance for measurement is that a microphone has
to be small compared with the wavelength if it is to register faithfully the
pressure in a sound field; otherwise, allowance must be made for the
diffraction by the microphone itself.

Reflection and Refraction at an
Extended Surface
When sound encounters a boundary between two media, some of the sound
is transmitted and some is reflected back into the first medium. The ratio of
the intensity in the transmitted sound to that in the incident sound depends
on the change in the characteristic impedance p0c at the boundary. Sound
travels much more swiftly in solids and liquids than in air, and of course the
densities of solids and liquids are very much greater than the density of air.
A consequence is that only a small fraction of the incident energy is
transmitted as sound passes from air to a solid or liquid, or as it passes in
the opposite direction. Most of the energy is reflected.

Sound Waves 81
When sound is reflected from a smooth surface whose extent is consider-
ably greater than the wavelength, the mechanism is similar to the specular
(mirrorlike) reflection that is so well known in optics. In these circumstances
the propagation of sound can be represented by rays and described geo-
metrically. The same laws apply in acoustics as in optics. For reflection, the
angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and the incident ray, the
reflected ray, and the normal to the surface at the point of reflection all lie in
the same plane. For refraction, the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence
to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the ratio of the velocities in
the first and second medium respectively. Expressed symbolically,
and
The rules that govern the change in direction of light or sound at a
boundary can be explained using Huygens' construction. Figure 3.19 shows
a plane wave incident on a reflecting boundary XX. Secondary waves arise
in turn at points on the boundary between A and C, and their envelope
defines the wavefront CD in the reflected wave. The law of reflection is shown
as follows. PA and RC are two parallel rays defining the path of the incident
sound. AB is a wavefront and therefore perpendicular to the incident rays. A
secondary wave starting from A will reach D in the time taken for sound to
travel from B to C. Therefore, AD equals BC. At D the tangent to the
secondary wave from A is a wavefront in the reflected sound and therefore is
perpendicular to the reflected ray AQ. The triangles ABC and CDA are
therefore congruent, so that the angles ACB and CAD are equal. It follows
that the angle i between the incident ray and the normal AN to the surface at
A is equal to the angle r between the reflected ray and the normal.
Figure 3.20 is a similar construction to show refraction. The sound has a
speed GI in the first medium shown above the boundary XX and a velocity

c2 in the second medium shown below the boundary. A secondary wave
from A reaches D in the time needed for sound to travel from B to C. Again,
AB is a wavefront in the incident sound, and because angle ABC is a right
angle, angle BAC is equal to the angle of incidence i. Similarly, angle ACD
is equal to the angle of refraction r. Therefore,
As mentioned previously, refraction by wind or temperature gradient is a
more common observation than the refraction at a boundary just described.
It is usual for the wind speed to increase with increasing height. The velocity
of sound relative to the ground is the velocity it would have in still air plus
the velocity of the wind. Suppose a sound ray is inclined slightly upwards
as it leaves the source. Because of the gradient in wind speed, the ray will
curve downwards if it travels downwind or upwards if it travels against the
wind. If an observer is standing upwind from the source the sound will tend
to pass over his head and not be heard, whereas if he is downwind the
opposite will happen. Sounds are therefore likely to be heard better at
locations downwind of the source (Figure 3.21).
Atmospheric temperature usually diminishes with increasing height. The
velocity of sound, which is proportional to the square root of the absolute
temperature, is then lower at altitude than at ground level (page 53).
Sound rays therefore tend to curve upwards above the observer (Figure
3.22). It can, however, happen that the atmospheric temperature gradient is
reversed, at least at low levels. This phenomenon is called temperature
inversion. This can occur over land on still, clear nights when the earth's

surface loses heat rapidly by radiation. The air, cooled by conduction, sinks
so that it does not mix with the warmer air above it. Sound rays in the
inverted temperature gradient curve downwards, making distant sources
unusually audible.

Refer to Table 1.1. What is the speed of sound at sea level? Give the
answer in m/s and then convert it to miles per hour (1 mile = 1.609
km).
3.9* Here is a simple experiment to find the speed of sound. You need two
objects (blocks of wood or Coke cans will do) that can be banged
together repeatedly to create a series of impulsive sounds. Stand at a
measured distance from a large reflecting surface such as the side of
a building. The distance needs to be at least 100 metres. Bang the
objects slowly at first and increase the rate gradually until each bang
coincides with the echo of the previous one. Have an assistant time
the rate of the impulses. The interval between successive impulses is
the time needed for sound to travel from you to the reflector and back
again. Dividing twice the measured distance by this interval will give
the speed of sound. Estimate the uncertainties in the measurements
and the accuracy of your result.
3.10 The Mach number is the speed of a moving object relative to the speed
of sound. A supersonic aircraft is flying at 33,000 ft at mach 1.2. How
many minutes will it take to travel 100 miles? (See question 3.8.)

furthest from their equilibrium positions (greatest positive or negative
particle displacements).
3.12 What is a wavefront? What can be said about the phases of sound
vibrations at points on a given wavefront?
3.13 If the frequency of sound is a simple multiple or fraction of 1000 Hz,
it is easy to find an approximate value for the corresponding
wavelength using the following mental arithmetic. 'The speed of
sound is approximately 340 metres per second, which is the same as
340 millimetres per millisecond. The period of an oscillation at 1000
Hz is 1 millisecond. Therefore, sound travels 340 millimetres in one
cycle. The wavelength at 1 kHz is 340 millimetres or 34 centimetres.'
Use this thinking to find the wavelength of sound at 500 Hz, 2 kHz,
and 4 kHz.
3.14 If the speed of sound is 340.3 ms-1, calculate the frequency for which
the wavelength is 192.2 mm.
3.15 Write a definition of the phase-change coefficient 
(or wavelength
constant). The symbol for this constant is k. Find the value of k when
the wavelength is 0.2 m.
3.16 Calculate k at 1600 Hz if the speed of sound is 340 ms-1. What is the
phase difference between vibrations at points separated by 17 mm in
the direction of propagation of a plane progressive wave?
3.17 This is an exercise in substituting numbers into formulae and calcu-
lating the results. If the particle displacement is given by
calculate its value for a 2-3 kHz tone at time t = 1.5 ms, and at a distance
x = 0.75 m from the source when the displacement amplitude is
0.31 jum. Take the velocity of sound to be 340 ms-1. (Remember that
the argument of the sine function is in radians.)
3.18 Distinguish between potential and kinetic energy. In a simple har-
monic oscillator the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential
energy is constant throughout the cycle. Sound energy density is
made up of potential and kinetic energy (per unit volume). Is it also
constant throughout the cycle?
3.19 Distinguish between sound energy density and sound intensity. In the
SI system, what units could be used to express these quantities?

86 Acoustics for Audiologists
3.20 Sound intensity in a plane wave can be expressed in terms of the

difference across it is 3 volts and (b) when it carries a current of
2 amps. Calculate the sound intensity corresponding to (c) an rms
sound pressure of 0.015 Pa and (d) an rms particle velocity of
0.012 ms-1 (Poc = 414 Nsm-3).
3.21 What is meant by the principle of superposition? Why does this
principle not apply to nonlinear systems such as the cochlea?
3.22 Explain what is meant in acoustics by interference and how it leads
to the production of standing waves.
3.23 If, hypothetically, one could view sound vibrations at a 'point' (that
is, in a very small region of the sound field), it would not be possible
to decide whether the vibrations were part of a progressive wave or
a standing wave. What other information would make it possible to
decide the difference?
3.24 What are nodes and antinodes? Why is it sometimes necessary to add
qualifiers such as velocity node, pressure node, and so forth?
3.25* Make an acoustic baffle out of a piece of stiff card or other appropri-
ate material. The baffle can be circular (about 12 inches in diameter)
or rectangular if preferred. Cut a 1-inch diameter hole in the centre
and attach the baffle to an audiometric earphone after first removing
the cushion. The baffle can be fixed to the rim of the earphone using
an adhesive such as Blu-tak. Place a sound-level meter with its
microphone close to a hard extended surface such as a wall from
which sound will be reflected and mount the earphone and baffle in
some way (a laboratory stand will do) to face the reflector. Drive the
earphone at a moderate frequency, 2 or 4 kHz for example, using an
audiometer or laboratory oscillator. Record the change in the indica-
tion on the sound-level meter as the distance between the source and
the reflector is varied. A series of maximum and minimum values
should be observable. Verify that the distance between the earphone
and the reflector changes by half a wavelength as the sound-level
reading passes from one maximum to the next.

3.29 
What are beats and how are they produced? A beat is heard when
two 1024-Hz tuning forks are sounded simultaneously. It is estimated
that there are, on average, 3 beats per second. One of the forks is
known to be accurate to better than 0.01%. What is the percentage
error in the frequency of the other fork?
3.30 
Two electrical signals, one at 25.00 kHz and the other at 25.05 kHz,
are added electrically and amplified. An earphone connected to the
amplifier fails to produce an audible sound. When the circuit is made
nonlinear by clipping positive cycles of the signal at the input to the
amplifier, an audible 50-Hz tone is created. Consider the current in
the earphone averaged during an interval of several milliseconds and
describe how the average changes with time. Hence explain the
creation of the audible tone.

What is meant by refraction? Explain what we mean by the angle of
incidence and the angle of refraction in optics and acoustics. A beam
of ultrasound in medium A makes an angle of incidence of 35Â° at the

Sources of Sound
Simple Sources
Any vibrating object, or indeed any localized disturbance of the air, is
necessarily a source of sound insofar as the disturbance is passed to other
regions by wave transmission. Although sources vary greatly in their
construction, their physical size, and the way in which they work, some
general observations are possible. It is helpful to begin by considering
sources that are physically so small compared with the wavelength of sound
that they are, for practical purposes, located at a point in the sound field.
When describing the diffraction of sound, it was stated that sound passes
readily around small objects so that they do not produce well-defined
acoustic shadows. As might be expected, a similar relationship exists in
regard to sources â a source that is small compared with the wavelength
radiates uniformly because there is no region corresponding to a shadow
from which sound is excluded. Although the sound field may be nonuniform
in regions very close to the source, it will become ever more uniform
(independent of direction from the source) as the distance is increased. A
simple source is one that radiates uniformly; most sources can be regarded
as simple when observed from a sufficient distance. It is self-evident that
wavefronts arising from a simple source are spherical rather than plane.
One of the most elementary sources that can be imagined is a small sphere
whose radius is made to vary sinusoidally to produce a uniform spherical
wave. This type of source is a hypothetical construction rather than a
practical reality, but the justification for introducing it is that many real
sources can be replaced by an equivalent spherical source, at least so far as
the sound field at a distance is concerned. The radial vibrations of a sphere
produce a sinusoidal movement at its surface, to and from the centre. The
velocity of the surface is therefore sinusoidal also. The velocity is directed,
of course, at right angles to the surface, and the velocity multiplied by the
area of the surface is therefore the volume of air displaced per second. The
rate at which air is displaced by the surface of the elementary spherical
source varies sinusoidally; the amplitude of this sinusoid is called the
strength of the source. The strength of a simple spherical source is therefore
the maximum rate of volume variation at its surface (in m3 s-1).

90 Acoustics for Audiologists
The strength of a source is an important characteristic because it
determines the acoustic power that will be radiated. For a simple source
whose dimensions are small compared with the wavelength, it can be shown
that the average power W in each cycle is given by
where Q is the strength of the source, p0 is the density of air, y is the
wavelength of sound, and k = 2n/L It can be seen from this that the power
at a given wavelength depends only on the physical properties of air and the
strength of the source. It is independent of the dimensions of the source, and
indeed any simple source of the same strength will produce the same power,
regardless of its construction, provided that its size is small compared with
the wavelength.
At a distance r from the source, this power is radiated through a spherical
surface whose area is equal to 47ir2, so the average sound intensity / at
distance r from a simple source of strength Q is given by
It is important to notice here that that the sound intensityâthe sound
energy passing through 1 m2 each secondâdiminishes with the inverse
square of the distance from the source (Figure 4.1). Measured in decibels,
the sound intensity decreases by 6 dB for each doubling of the distance from
the source. This is in accordance with the principle of conservation of
energy. Air is perfectly elastic and no energy is lost during sound trans-
mission, providing, of course, that the sound field does not contain any
sound-absorbing objects. The rate at which sound energy is transmitted
through any closed surface surrounding the source must therefore equal the
rate at which it is supplied by the source, and sound intensity must
necessarily diminish with the increase in areaâproportional to the square
of the radiusâof an imaginary sphere having the source at its centre.
It can be shown that the sound intensity in a spherical wave is propor-
tional to the square of the sound pressure; the relationship between these
quantities is the same for both spherical and plane waves, namely,
as in Equation 3.6 in the previous chapter. Notice that the analogy with
electrical power in a simple resistance still applies. By combining these
equations we obtain expressions for the sound pressure in terms of the

strength of the source and the radiated power:
and
It is important to observe that the sound pressure is inversely propor-
tional to the distance from the source and that for a given radiated power
it is independent of frequency. The significance of this is that sound-level
meters detect the presence of sound using microphones that respond to
sound pressure. The indicated sound level is derived from the average
squared value of the sound pressure. From the foregoing discussion it will
be seen that the indicated sound level is simply related to the average
intensity in the sound field and to the power of the source.
The relationship between intensity and particle velocity in a divergent
sound field is, however, more complicated. We find that close to the source
the particle velocity is greater than it would be in a plane wave of the same
intensity, and as the source is approached, we find that the particle velocity

lags the sound pressure instead of being in phase with it. The electrical
analogy is with a circuit that has inductance as well as resistance. In general,
then, the particle velocity in a spherical wave has a component in phase with
the sound pressure and a component that lags the pressure by n/2. The
overall phase difference, determined by the vector sum of these components,
therefore lies somewhere between zero at points far removed from the source
and n/2 at points very close to it. In this context what matters is not the
absolute distance from the source but the distance relative to the wavelength
1 of the sound being produced. A convenient way of expressing distance in
relative terms is to multiply by the phase-change coefficient k. Recalling that
k = 2n/2, the distance r from the centre of the source multiplied by k is
The sound particle velocity is in phase with the sound pressure when kr Â» 1
and lags by one quarter of a cycle when kr Â« 1. In general the phase
difference between pressure and velocity is 6, where tan 6 = l/kr.
The phase relationship between particle velocity and sound pressure is
used to define two kinds of sound field. The far field of a source is a region
in which pressure and velocity have practically the same phase; the near field
of a source is a region in which there is a significant difference in phase. The
sound intensity corresponding to a particle velocity u in the far field of a
source is given by
as it is for a plane wave. In the far field, the particle velocity is inversely
proportional to the distance from the source, and for a given radiated power
it is independent of frequency. In the near field, the increase in particle
velocity as the source is approached is more rapid and not independent of
frequency (Figure 4.2). For example, at one-tenth of a wavelength from the
centre of a simple source, the particle velocity in the spherical wave is
approximately 16 times greater than it would be in a plane wave of the same
intensity.
Double Sources
Vibrating objects usually have more than one vibrating surface. It often
happens that the sound is produced principally at just two surfaces moving
in opposite directions, that is, in antiphase. For example, if a loudspeaker is
not mounted in a large baffle or in a sealed cabinet, sound is radiated from
both the front and back surfaces of the cone. Similarly, a vibrating plate or

particle velocity in a plane wave of the same intensity.
string has opposed surfaces that are the sources of the sound they produce.
It is evident that if such double sources are small compared with the
wavelength, the radiation from one surface will almost cancel the radiation
from the other and, compared with a single source, a much greater vibration
will be needed to produce a given sound. For example, the vibrations of a
string or the tines of a tuning fork are often large enough to be clearly
visible, but the sound that such objects produce directly is feeble.
A double source comprising two sources of equal strength but opposite
phase, separated by a small distance is called an acoustic doublet or acoustic
dipole. The arrangement is illustrated in Figure 4.3. Suppose that each
FIG. 4.3 Acoustic double source.

94 Acoustics for Audiologists
source has strength Q and that the distance between the sources is l. We are
interested in the sound pressure at a point A at the distance r and angle 6
shown in the figure. The sound pressure can be calculated at any point in
the field of the doublet by adding the components due to each source acting
alone (principle of superposition). However, it is not possible to obtain a
mathematically simple result unless some conditions are imposed. These are
that kl is small compared with 1 and that kr is much greater than 1. If only
the first condition applies, then the rms sound pressure at A is
If both conditions apply,
These expressions may look a little complicated, but, for a given
wavelength, they each have the form
As with a simple source, the sound pressure is inversely proportional to the
distance from the source, but for the dipole it also varies with the cosine of
the angle to the axis, so that the pressure distribution around the dipole has
two lobes1 (Figure 4.4). The sound pressure created by the double source is
kl cos 9 times that for a single source. Because this factor is much less than
1 (in accordance with the stated conditions), the double source is necessarily
much weaker than its single-source counterpart. It can be shown that the
total power radiated is less by a factor of (kl)2/3.
Infinite Baffles
Radiation from the back of a source such as a loudspeaker can be excluded
by means of a baffle. A baffle consists of a plane, rigid surface with an
aperture that just accommodates the source. It is not possible to formulate
general expressions for the field in front of the baffle, but certain special
cases are usually described. Foremost among these is that of a circular
source in an infinite baffle. Obviously, an infinite obstruction is a mathemat-
ical abstraction, but in practice finite baffles behave in much the same way
1The lobes are perfectly circular if the sound pressure is plotted in absolute units (Pa instead
of dB).

provided that their extent is much greater than the wavelength of the
radiated sound. As with the spherical source considered previously, the
shape of the source is unimportant so long as it is small compared with the
wavelength.
To start, suppose that the source is the small sphere considered previ-
ously. This is illustrated in part 1 of Figure 4.5. The sound fields are identical
at points A' and A, on either side of the source. Adding the baffle (2) has
virtually no effect on the sound field of this simple source because the
particle velocity is parallel to its surface at all places close to the surface so
that no reflection occurs. It would therefore make no difference to the sound
pressure at A if the back of the source were removed and replaced by a fixed
(nonvibrating) surface (4). In these circumstances, however, there would be
no sound at A'. Note, however, that because of diffraction, sound would be
present at A' if the baffle were absent (3). If the sources illustrated in parts
1 and 4 of the diagram have the same radius and vibrate with the same
amplitude, it is evident that the hemispherical source has half the strength
of its spherical counterpart. But the sound pressure at A is the same in each
case. If, therefore, the vibrational amplitude of the hemispherical source is
doubled so as to give it the same strength as the spherical source, the sound
pressure will also be doubled. In other words, a small source in an infinite
baffle produces twice the sound pressure that can be obtained in the
unobstructed field of simple source of the same strength.

96 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 4.5 Spherical source and infinite baffle.
Circular Pistons
Suppose the source is a circular plate that just fills the opening in the baffle,
and suppose that the plate moves sinusoidally in a direction perpendicular
to the baffle. A physical piston just described is not strictly necessary
because exactly the same radiation would be produced by a disk of air
moving in the same way. The theory that follows would therefore apply
equally to the radiation from a pipe provided that its opening was flanged
by an extensive baffle. A circular piston opening into an infinite baffle is
again an abstraction, but it is important because many real sources behave
in approximately the same way and, reciprocally, the directional properties
of this type of source are those of a circular microphone placed close to a
large plane surface.2
2Microphones used to record conversations in interview rooms are often mounted against a
wall so that they receive frontal radiation only.

Sources of Sound 97
The mathematical analysis of radiation from a piston is difficult except in
some special cases. An important case which clearly has practical applica-
tion is where the sound pressure is required at large distance from the
source. This means that if the distance is r, then kr must be large compared
with unity. Again, suppose we have a point A at a distance r from the centre
of the piston, and suppose that a line from A to the centre is inclined at an
angle 6 to the axis, as shown in Figure 4.6. The diagram is symmetrical
about the axis, and, in polar coordinates, A is the point (r, 6). It can be
shown that the sound pressure at A is given by
where a is the radius of the piston. To understand this equation, compare it
FIG. 4.6 Intensity distributions for piston in an infinite baffle.

98 Acoustics for Audiologists
with Equation 4.1. The first few terms are the same, except that the 4 in front
of the root sign has been replaced by a 2, implying that, other things being
equal, the sound pressure is double that of a simple source of the same
strength. The last term, F( ), is a function whose value depends on ka
multiplied by the sine of the angle from the point A to the source. The value
of this function can be obtained from mathematical tables.3 For points on
the axis where 6 is zero, the function is equal to 1, so that the pressure is
exactly double what would be obtained from a simple source. At other
points the pressure always has a lower value depending on the angle to the
axis and the wavelength of sound. The sound intensity is proportional to the
square of the sound pressure, and its distribution around the piston source
has one or more lobes depending on the wavelength (Figure 4.6). Notice
that at low frequencies the radiation is almost uniform, but at high
frequencies a far greater proportion of sound is radiated centrally.
The directional behaviour of a source can be expressed in terms of what
is called the directivity factor. This is defined as the ratio of the sound
intensity I0 on the axis at a distance r from the source to a reference
intensity Iref. The latter is defined as the total radiated power W divided by
the area of a sphere of radius r. So, the directivity factor D is defined as
where
The quantity d = 10 log D is called the directivity index or directional gain.
It is evident from the definition just given that D is equal to 1 for a simple
source. It can be shown that the directivity factor of the piston source
approaches 2 when ka is much less than 1, but it is approximately equal to
(ka)2 for large values of ka.
Real sources are unlikely to have the same directivity as the hypothetical
piston. One reason for this is that the moving partâthe diaphragm of a
loudspeaker, for exampleâis likely to be flexible, so that the motion is not
uniform over the whole surface. Real baffles are, of course, not infinite, and
indoors scattering from other reflecting objects makes the source less
directional. As a generalization, it may be said that the directivity is greater
at high frequencies than at low frequencies. At points away from the axis,
the intensity of high-frequency sounds is likely to be considerably reduced.
This can be a problem in public address systems outdoors, where scattering

Sources of Sound 99
by neighbouring objects has little effect. This is one reason why such systems
often employ groups of speakers pointing in different directions.
Practical Sources
This section considers sound sources in common use, paying particular
attention to those that have audiological applications.
Tuning Forks
The tuning fork is a surprisingly complicated source in that it is a far from
trivial matter to present a complete analysis of its manner of vibration and
sound production. It has, however, some very useful properties. The sound
it produces is a pure sinusoid; its frequency is highly stable, and its simple,
rugged construction and small size make it ideal as a portable instrument.
Its principal use, of course, is as a frequency standard for tuning musical
instruments, but it has also been adapted for diagnostic use in clinical
audiology. From a mechanical point of view the fork can be regarded either
as a single 'free-free' bar or as two 'fixed-free' bars attached to a heavy base
(Figure 4.7). In its fundamental mode, a straight free-free bar vibrates about
two nodes located symmetrically about its centre. Bending the bar into a U
causes the nodes to move closer together, and the additional mass and
stiffness of the stem has a similar effect. The stem shares the vibration of the
central antinode. When the fork is regarded as two fixed-free bars, it is
FIG. 4.7 The tuning fork.

100 Acoustics for Audiologists
apparent from the symmetry that forces on the stem cancel in the lateral
direction but that components in the direction of the axis of the stem
remain.
The tines of a tuning fork can vibrate in modes other than the fundamen-
tal. As mentioned previously (Chapter 3), these modes give rise to overtones
whose frequencies are not harmonics of the fundamental, and a harsh tone
is produced if the fork is struck with sufficient force to add significant
vibration at the modal frequencies. The overtones tend, however, to be more
highly damped than the fundamental, and when used carefully a tuning fork
produces a very pure tone. Its frequency is highly stable, perhaps to 1 in 105
if its temperature is kept constant. Even if temperature does change, its effect
on frequency is to reduce it by only about 1 in 104 for each degree Celsius
temperature rise.
The width of the tines is of course very small compared with the
wavelength of the radiated sound, and as a source of airborne sound the
tuning fork is rather feeble. A further complication is that each tine has an
inner and outer surface, so that it is in effect a double source, and the fork
as a whole has two such double sources. The fork is therefore a seemingly
unsatisfactory source for air conduction audiometry. Nevertheless, suffi-
ciently reproducible results can be obtained if it is used in a standard way,
that is, close to the ear with the tines in line with the axis of the external ear
canal.
In otological applications the vibration of the stem of the tuning fork is
particularly important because it is used as a source of bone-conducted
sound. The origin of this vibration is not as obvious as it might appear. If
the fork is regarded simply as a free-free bar then the motion of the stem is
derived from the central antinode as just described, but if the stem is
relatively massive then the fixed-free description is more appropriate, in
which case the antinode does not exist. A general explanation can, however,
be provided as follows. In our discussion of Newton's laws in Chapter 1 it
was pointed out that 'it is impossible to move the centre of mass of any
closed system by any action occurring entirely within it'. If the fork is
unrestrained, its centre of mass will remain entirely motionless in spite of the
vibration of its various components. Imagine that the fork is upright as
shown in Figure 4.7. When the tines bend, the centre of their combined mass
will move very slightly upwards or downwards relative to the mass of the
stem and lower parts of the fork. (If this is not obvious, it will become so if
the bending is imagined to be much greater than would normally be.) In
order to keep the centre of mass of the entire fork motionless, the stem must
therefore move vertically in the opposite direction. It can be shown that if
the tines move sinusoidally at the fundamental frequency, the movement of
the stem has a component at the fundamental frequency and components at

Sources of Sound 101
higher frequencies. The fundamental is usually dominant, but there may be
a significant component at twice this frequency. Some low-frequency forks
(128 Hz and less)âfor example, those used by neurologists to elicit the
sense of vibrationâare likely to have stem vibrations that are predomi-
nantly at the double frequency, but the standard otologists' tuning forks
with frequencies from 250 Hz upwards produce negligible stem vibration at
frequencies other than the fundamental. The double-frequency component
can be reduced by giving the tines a slight 'set' so that they are not exactly
parallel to each other.
The stem of a tuning fork vibrates with an amplitude that is very small
compared with that of the tines. One can regard this state of affairs as
analogous to a lever in which the tines have a large mechanical advantage
over the stem. As a consequence their motion is not greatly damped by
holding the stem in the fingers or even by pressing it against a hard surface.
The technical description would be that the fork is mechanically a high-
impedance source when its output is taken from the base (as in a bone
conduction test). To produce a strong sound from a tuning fork it is
necessary to place its stem on some large surface that can serve as a
sounding board. The vibrations are of course damped by this action, but
not excessively so, for they may remain audible for several seconds.
Loudspeakers
Loudspeakers radiate sound into a more or less unconfined space, as distinct
from earphones, which are sources coupled directly to the ear. In nearly all
loudspeakers the source is a vibrating diaphragm that is driven either
electrodynamically by passing a current through a coil attached to the
diaphragm, or electrostatically. Most speakers are of the electrodynamic
type. The diaphragm is usually a shallow, stiff cone made of a lightweight
material such as paper (Figure 4.8). It is supported around its circumference
by an annulus of corrugated material that allows axial movement but is
relatively resistant to movement in a radial direction. Additional support is
often provided centrally, again using corrugated material. The coil (known
as the voice coil) is cemented to the centre of the diaphragm It lies in a
narrow cylindrical gap between the pole pieces of a powerful permanent
magnet. The magnetic field is radial, so that when current passes through
the coil, an axial force is generated. The diaphragm together with the voice
coil and the suspension system constitute a mechanical oscillator as de-
scribed in Chapters 2 and 7. Vibrations are damped, partly by mechanical
losses in the suspension, but more importantly by interaction with the
surrounding air and the creation of sound waves. The movement of the coil

in the magnetic field creates a voltage proportional to the velocity of the
coil. This is similar to the back emf in an electric motor, and its effect is
generally to reduce the output of the speaker, particularly if the amplifier
that drives it has a low impedance so that it provides the same voltage
regardless of load.
The design of a loudspeaker is a difficult task requiring compromises to
be made according to the mechanical, acoustical, and electrical specifica-
tions. It is virtually impossible to design a speaker that will perform
efficiently and that will have a uniform, undistorted acoustic response over
the entire auditory range. Most 'hi-fi' systems have two or more speakers,
each restricted to a range of frequencies in which their performance has been
optimized. Efficiencies are lowâoften just a few percent â and most of the
electrical energy supplied ends up as heat in the voice coil.
An obvious difficulty, particularly troublesome at low frequencies, is that
a simple diaphragm will radiate from both the front and the back surfaces.

Sources of Sound 103
This problem is often overcome by mounting the speaker in a cabinet so
that sound from the back surface of the cone is absorbed. If the enclosed
speaker is placed near a wall or other extended surface, it then becomes, to
a first approximation, a piston source in an infinite baffle, at least for sounds
of short wavelength.
The low-frequency performance of a speaker can be improved by fitting
a horn. This is often done for speakers intended for public address systems.
The action of the horn is equivalent to that of a transformer in providing a
better match between the electomechanical properties of the diaphragm and
the acoustic load. In effect the sound pressure on the diaphragm in the
throat of the horn is raised relative to the pressure at the mouth of the horn,
and importantly, the pressure is more nearly in phase with the velocity of
the diaphragm than would be the case if the horn were removed. This leads
to a considerable increase in efficiency. The high acoustic output required in
public address systems is of course out of place in audiological applications,
and loudspeakers for audiological use are invariably of the direct-radiation
type. Hornlike tubing is, however, sometimes used in hearing aids to connect
the earphone and the ear canal.4
Audiometric Earphones
The construction of an audiometric earphone is usually similar to that of a
small loudspeaker but the design requirements are quite different. A loud-
speaker is intended to radiate into an open space, whereas an earphone is
coupled directly to the ear so that its output is to the volume of air trapped
beneath the earcap (earphone cushion) and the pinna together with the
ear canal and the middle ear, as described in Chapter 7. The requirement
is for a uniform frequency response in a real ear, ear simulator, or acous-
tic coupler and for very low distortion over a very wide range of output
power. The radiated acoustic power is generally much less than that
required of a loudspeaker, and comparatively small displacements of
the diaphragm are needed. The design objectives are achieved in the
construction shown in Figure 4.9. The diaphragm is made of metal
foil to produce a rigid conical piston that moves as a unit without
breaking up into alternative modes of vibration at high frequencies. The
suspension is quite stiff, having only one simple corrugation. The conical
backplate and the enclosing plastic case prevent sound being radiated from
the back surface of the diaphragm, and the felt pads in vents cut in the

high-frequency response of the hearing aid.

backplate provide acoustic damping. A typical frequency response is shown
in Figure 4.10.
Hearing Aid Earphones
Hearing aid earphones, also known as receivers because they receive an
electrical signal and convert it to sound, are either of the external type,
mounted directly on the earmould and intended mainly for use with
body-worn aids, or of the miniature type used in behind-the-ear and

in-the-ear models. Design considerations include the conflicting require-
ments of low power consumption and high output sound pressure. The
frequency response is intentionally far from uniform. It makes use of natural
resonances in the earphone to give response characteristics considered
desirable for a hearing aid, compensating both for hearing loss and the
presence of an earmould. The displacement of the diaphragm should be a
reasonably linear function of the drive current, but the near-perfect linearity
found in an audiometric earphone is unnecessary and a small amount of
distortion is acceptable. Small size and low cost are important.
Figure 4.1la shows the construction of a miniature receiver designed for
use in a behind-the-ear hearing aid. The driving force is produced by an
armature which is made from a flat strip of ferromagnetic material bent to
the shape of a letter U, rather like a tuning fork. One limb of the armature
lies in an air gap between the poles of two permanent magnets that produce
a field perpendicular to the surface of the strip. The other limb is attached
to the magnet and pole piece assembly. The armature passes through a coil
so that its free end is magnetized with a polarity that depends on the
direction of the alternating drive current in the coil. The armature is
therefore attracted to one or other of the permanent magnets. Its movement
is coupled to the diaphragm by the drive rod as shown in the diagram. The
diaphragm operates within a very small air volume, so it can produce a high
sound pressure. Sound is transmitted through a small outlet pipe attached
to the top cup and then through a connector that joins the plastic pipe to
the earmould.

(Based on a drawing supplied by Knowles Electronic Company.) (b) Equivalent
electric circuit representing the magnetic circuit of the earphone.
The design of the earphone is somewhat more subtle than it might appear
at first sight. Its magnetic components form what is called a magnetic circuit.
This is analogous to an electric circuit in which voltage (electromotive force)
represents a magnetic potential (measured in ampere-turns) and in which
electric current represents magnetic flux (in webers). The magnetic equival-

Sources of Sound 107
ent of resistance is called reluctance (in henries). An electric circuit equival-
ent to the magnetic circuit of the earphone is shown in Figure 4.lib. The
permanent magnets, represented by batteries, provide a steady (dc) magnetic
flux. The pole piece has a very low reluctance and can therefore be
represented as a direct connection between the outer ends of the magnets
and the fixed end of the armature. The free end of the armature is equivalent
to the moving contact in a potential divider represented by the resistances
R1 and R2 that correspond to the magnetic reluctances of the two air gaps.
Ideally, the tip of the armature should lie centrally between the magnets to
make the reluctances of the air gaps equal (R1 = R2). There is then no dc
flux in the armature. In this condition the armature is said to be balanced.
The drive coil generates an alternating magnetic potential and is therefore
represented as an alternating-voltage source. The transducer can operate
either as an earphone or as a microphone. As an earphone, it works as just
described; as a microphone, displacement of the tip of the armature reduces
one air gap and increases the other, causing a magnetic flux to flow in the
armature. This generates a voltage difference across the ends of the coil. (If
the transducer is used as a microphone, the alternating source is replaced
by a galvanometer in the equivalent electric circuit.)
The balanced armature design offers good linearity and high efficiency in
a compact arrangement. A particular advantage is that the coil itself does
not move (as it would in a conventional loudspeaker or dynamic micro-
phone), so its mass can be disregarded. The components of the earphone
can be modified at manufacture to reduce the output at low frequencies or
to reduce the high-frequency peaks, according to the user's requirements. A
typical response curve is shown in Figure 4.12.

Audiometric Bone Vibrator
A bone vibrator held against the mastoid can provide direct bone-conducted
stimulation of the cochlea for audiometric purposes. Similar vibrators are
used in bone conduction hearing aids for patients who lack an adequate air
conduction pathway. The construction of a typical audiometric vibrator is
shown in Figure 4.13. Vibration is transmitted through a plastic case in
contact with the patient's head. An armature, screwed to the case, is

cross section through the vibrator; the subsidiary diagram shows details of the
spring that connects the case and armature to the magnet. (Based on a drawing

Sources of Sound 109
attracted to the poles of a permanent magnet. The pole pieces pass through
coils carrying the drive current, whose effect is to add an alternating
component to the magnetic field. The magnet and coil assembly is attached
to a lead block to increase its mass. The assembly is suspended by a leaf
spring which maintains the separation between the poles and the armature.
The case and armature can be represented by a mass m, and the magnet,
lead block, and coils by a mass M. These masses are connected mechanically
by the spring. If the vibrator were suspended freely, m and M would oscillate
about their centre of mass, which would remain stationary. In use, however,
the movement of the smaller mass is restricted by its contact with the head
so that the centre of mass is obliged to move, creating a reaction that
constitutes the desired auditory stimulus. The response of a typical vibrator
is illustrated in Figure 4.14. The force generated for a given drive voltage
and the corresponding stimulus both vary considerably with frequency.
An undesirable feature of the type of vibrator just described is that it is a
source of airborne sound. The vibrator is, however, a fairly small object
compared with the wavelength of sound over most of its useful range, and
radiation from one side of the vibrating case tends to cancel radiation from
the opposite side. The use of foam earplugs to attenuate the air-conducted
sound is sometimes recommended for bone conduction audiometry at
frequencies from 3 kHz upwards.

Suspend a Radioear B71 audiometric bone vibrator by its supply
cable so that the driving face is vertical. To do this, cut a wine cork
in half longitudinally, pass the cable between the two parts, and then
bind them together with tape. It may help if the cable is first stiffened
by binding it to a straight piece of thick wire, made from a coat
hanger perhaps. Hold the cork vertically in a laboratory clamp, with
the cable and bone vibrator hanging below. Place a sound-level meter
with its microphone at the same height as the vibrator at a distance
of 20 cm. Drive the vibrator at 1 kHz or at a higher frequency using
an audiometer or other oscillator and measure the air-radiated sound.

this for different frequencies and with the microphone at different
distances from the source. If standing waves are a problem, use
warble tones or narrow bands of noise instead of tones. The orienta-
tion of the vibrator can be estimated visually, but for better precision
you can fix a pointer or a scale to the cork to measure its orientation.
If the cable has been stiffened as suggested, the vibrator will turn
through the same angle as the cork.

filters. Place the stem of a tuning fork on an artificial mastoid and
compare the output at the stated frequency of the fork with that at
twice this frequency. You may observe a significant vibratory output
at the double frequency when using at 125- or 250-Hz fork.

the tines of a tuning fork. Observe that the fork sounds much louder
when the card is at about 45Â° to the direction of vibration. It then
restricts the circulation of air around the tine. Placing the card
between the tines or in line with them has little effect. This demon-
stration, attributed to Stokes in 1868, is described by Rayleigh in The

Nonsinusoidai Waveforms
The notion that real systems can undergo perfect sinusoidal oscillation is
essential in the description of acoustic phenomena. Our descriptions rely
heavily on terms such as angular frequency, phase, amplitude, wavelength,
and so on that have no meaning except in the context of such oscillation.
The fact that analysis is based on sounds that are not part of the real
acoustic environment should not surprise us. Simplification is at the heart
of the scientific method and remains acceptable so long as it enhances
understanding and leads to descriptions that accord with observations of
actual events.1 The problem for acoustics is to extend the ideas developed
for harmonic oscillation so that they may be of value in the description of
more general kinds of vibration.
If we recorded examples of the sounds that we normally encounter and
displayed them on an oscilloscope, we would usually find the waveforms to
be irregular. Their appearance would not be entirely random and we would
probably find sections where the vibrations were more or less periodic, but
it would be difficult to discern any overall pattern. The problem of analysing
such waveforms has been solved mathematically by applying transforms in
which the original wave is replaced by sine and cosine waves. The mathe-
matics is perhaps not as simple as a familiarity with these transforms may
lead us to believe, but computer processing has made transformation a
practical reality, and it has become a standard analytical tool. There are
many applications. In audiology the analysis of otoacoustic emissions and
the digital processing of speech signals are well-known examples. Because of
the fundamental importance of frequency analysis in understanding non-
sinusoidal waveforms, we will start with a rather general and nonmathemat-
ical account of the Fourier transform.
The Fourier Transform
The transform has its origins in Fourier's work in the early 19th century on
heat conduction. The essence of the transform is that it takes any function
1According to anecdote, a theoretical paper on the hazard to aircraft from bird strikes began
with the words 'consider a spherical chicken...'.

114 Acoustics for Audiologists
of one variable, let us say x, and converts it to a different, but related,
function2 of another variable s. In other words,
f(x) has the transform F(s).
When s is specified, the function F(s) supplies sine and cosine terms whose
amplitudes and arguments contain s. The transformation is a purely
algebraic process, and x and s may or may not represent tangible physical
quantities, but in many applications, including acoustics, x often represents
time and s often represents frequency.
The importance of the Fourier transform is therefore that it allows us to
describe the response of physical systems either as a function of time or as
a function of frequency. The functions are f(t) and F(w), where t is time and
ft) is angular frequency. When we obtain F(w) from f(t), we say that F(w)
is the Fourier transform of f(t). It is also possible to carry out this process
in reverse so that f(t) can be obtained from F(w). This involves calculation
of the inverse transform of F(w). The two functions should therefore be
considered in pairs. From a purely mathematical point of view it is true that
not all functions have transforms, but fortunately those that are transform-
able include all that describe real physical events. If a time function can be
seen on an oscilloscope or plotted on a chart recorder, then it does have a
Fourier transform.
To explain the process in more familiar terms, suppose that we drive an
audiometric earphone from some electrical source that generates a rectan-
gular voltage pulse at its terminals. This is exactly what happens when we
use acoustic clicks as a stimulus for auditory evoked potentials. Now, the
pressure waveform inside the ear canal will not be a faithful replica of the
voltage waveform at the earphone. In fact, the two waveforms may have
little resemblance, because the sound pressure that is created by the voltage
pulse depends on the dynamics of the earphone and the acoustics of the ear
canal. The time course of the sound pressure in the ear could be recorded
using a probe microphone, or the measurements could be made on an ear
simulator rather than a real ear. Either way, we arrive at a description of
the output of the earphone as a function of time. This is called the time
domain response. But in audiology we usually want to know what frequen-
cies are involved so that we can relate the physiological response to the
audiogram or to some other frequency-related feature of hearing. The
prospect of converting the time response to a frequency description is
therefore inviting. Applying the transform to the time function leads to a
description in the frequency domain. We can visualize F(w) as a continuous
spectrum in which sinusoids of all frequencies are represented. If all the

sinusoids were added we would recover the original time function. The
magnitude of F(o>) tells us the relative contribution to the time function
coming from sinusoids whose frequencies are in the neighbourhood of some
chosen value of co.
Figure 5.1 shows the frequency spectrum corresponding to the Fourier
transform of a rectangular pulse. To give the pulse some physical meaning,
we may imagine again that it describes a voltage waveform applied to an
earphone. Suppose that the voltage is turned on at time zero and turned off
1 ms later, having remained constant in the interval. It can be seen that low
frequencies make an important contribution, while at higher frequencies the
spectrum consists of a series of diminishing 'heaps' at intervals of 1 kHz (the
reciprocal of the duration of the pulse). Notice that the first minimum in the
spectrum occurs at 1 kHz. If the pulse width is reduced, the first minimum
moves to a higher frequency. A short pulse therefore has a more uniform
spectrum than a long one (Figure 5.2); an infinitely short (but infinitely
strong) pulse would theoretically have a completely uniform spectrum. This

spectrum changes with pulse width. The parameter is the pulse width t in

is a general feature of all transient signals â the shorter their duration, the
broader their spectra.
The Fourier transforms of two other time functions are shown in Figures
5.3 and 5.4. The first of these is a simple exponential decay, the voltage on
a capacitor perhaps, whose charge is instantaneously established at time
zero and then allowed to leak away through a resistor. The second is a
damped sinusoidal oscillation. Once initiated, the oscillations dimmish
exponentially at a rate depending on the amount of damping. In this
example the spectrum is, as one would expect, greatest at frequencies close
to the frequency of oscillation. The widening of the spectrum around the
peak increases with the amount of damping. On the other hand, if the
damping is progressively reduced towards zero so that vibrations die away
ever more slowly, the distribution around the peak becomes narrower until
all that remains is a line at the frequency of the oscillator. We will consider
line spectra later on.

117
FIG. 5.3 An exponential signal and its Fourier transform.
The Fourier transform provides an alternative way of describing events,
allowing them to be pictured in either the time or frequency domain. The
frequency view is particularly useful when we want to know how a system
will respond to a given input. By system we mean anything for which there
can exist a definable input and output. The input might be a voltage or a
sound pressure or some other physical entity, and the response likewise.
The earphone example given earlier is typical. Its input is a voltage,
and its output is a sound pressure in the ear canal. The problem is to relate
the output to the input. This may well be difficult, but we are often nearer
a solution if the input can be described in terms of its spectrum and
the system described in terms of its frequency response. The mathe-
matical steps involved need not concern us here, but we might intuitively
expect the response at any one frequency to depend on the system's
frequency response multiplied by the 'amount' of the spectrum of the input
at that frequency.

Describing the Spectrum
The word spectrum is used as a general term to imply that something is
distributed according to frequency. In optics we talk of the visible spectrum,
meaning the distribution of optical frequencies and their associated colours.
The same idea applies in other branches of physics and, of course, in
acoustics. When describing a sound spectrum, the distributed quantity is
usually sound pressure or something closely allied to it. The distribution
may or may not be continuous, but we will assume for the moment that we
are dealing with a continuous spectrum in which all frequencies are possible
within a specified, and possibly infinite, range. Because the spectrum
involves harmonic (sinusoidal) oscillation, we usually describe it in terms of
amplitudes or root mean square values, or as power (power spectrum). The
latter can be found by squaring the rms values.
A specified range of frequencies constitutes what is called a frequency
band. It is often useful to express the range as the ratio of the highest
frequency, f2, to the lowest frequency, f1. The octave is a convenient unit for
this purpose. The bandwidth is one octave if f2/f1 = 2. It is a third-octave if

Nonsinusoidal Waveforms 
119
f2/f1 = 21/3. When bandwidths are expressed as ratios,3 or as fractions of
an octave, the centre frequency fc of the band is the geometric mean of the
limiting frequencies; that is, fc = ^/f1f2. For example, the centre of the
one-octave band between 4 kHz and 8 kHz is ^/32 = 5-66 kHz.
The total acoustic energy due to all component vibrations within the
band is called the band power. If expressed in decibels,4 it is the band power
level. The corresponding sound pressure is the band pressure or band
pressure level. A bandwidth of 1 Hz is a significant special case because the
band power level or pressure level in a 1-Hz band is sometimes called the
spectrum level. Unfortunately, not all authorities agree on this definition.
However, there is a better description of the spectrum that denotes some-
thing similar to the spectrum level except that the bandwidth is made
increasingly narrow until it becomes infinitesimally small. Of course, the
power in such a band is also infinitesimally small, but if we divide the
power in the band by the bandwidth, we obtain, in the limit, a finite quantity
called the power spectral density or, in decibels, the power spectral density
level. Similar definitions apply to specified quantities, such as sound pres-
sure, that are related to power. We therefore find spectral density defined as
the mean square of the sound pressure (or other defined quantity) divided
by the bandwidth, as the bandwidth approaches zero. Again, level may be
appended to denote the decibel equivalent. The difficulty is that the name
spectrum level is a permissible synonym of spectral density level. If the word
density is included, then an infinitesimal bandwidth is implied, but if it is
omitted, there may be some ambiguity. Fortunately, a 1-Hz band is so
narrow that the two quantities usually have the same numerical value
whatever definition is used. The spectral density describes the spectrum at a
particular frequency, namely, the frequency at the centre of the infinitesimal
band. Its usefulness is seen if we consider a small band of frequencies over
which the spectrum is sensibly uniform. Multiplying the spectral density in
this part of the spectrum by the bandwidth gives the total power in the band.
Bandwidth and spectrum level are important characteristics of a signal. A
sinusoid has zero bandwidth and is easily handled by amplifiers and
transducers. A transient is more difficult, particularly if it has a short
duration. Its generation and transmission require equipment whose operat-
ing bandwidth and frequency response are commensurate with the spectrum
of the signal. It should be remembered that the bandwidth of any real
equipment is finite, depending particularly on the response characteristics of
3Frequency is often shown on a logarithmic scale so that equal distances along the frequency
axis correspond to equal frequency ratios. See Appendix A.

terminology that we have not hitherto explained. Information about decibels is provided in
the next chapter and in Appendix B.

120 Acoustics for Audiologists
transducers rather than the performance of electronic amplifiers. In audiol-
ogy we have the further complication that the acoustics of the outer ear or
the mechanics of the head are almost certain to modify the signals received
from earphones and bone vibrators. What leaves the audiometer as a clean
electrical pulse is likely to end up as a stimulus with a very different
waveform. This is a particular difficulty for work involving evoked poten-
tials, where short-duration stimuli are nearly always required. It is to a lesser
degree a problem in the measurement of click-evoked otoacoustic emissions,
where, ideally, one would like the stimulus to have a uniform spectrum in
the range 500 to 6000 Hz. In practice it is often necessary to settle for
something less perfect.
Signals and Noise
The words signal and noise usually have obvious meanings in context, and
we have already used signal in the foregoing text without definition. It is
difficult to give entirely satisfactory definitions of these terms, but in physics
generallyâand that includes acousticsâthe word noise usually means
something unwanted that interferes with the detection or measurement of
some other quantity, namely the signal. But these are very general state-
ments. Usually in acoustics a signal is something with an obvious pattern,
and often, but not always, the noise is haphazard. The linguistic difficulty is
that we need a word to denote the object of interest whether it be a sound
pressure at a microphone or a voltage at some point in an amplifier, and it
would be inconvenient to change the word according to the category of
waveform. In these circumstances we accept that signal means the sound
pressure or voltage under discussion even if its waveform has no pattern.
We speak of 'signal processing' rather than 'noise processing'. The distinc-
tion between a desired signal and an undesired noise is clear, however, when
we talk of signal-to-noise ratio. This is defined as the power in a sample of
the signal divided by the power in a corresponding sample of the noise. The
ratio is important because the ability to detect or to accurately measure the
signal is usually directly related to it.
So far we have considered only signals such as a pulse or a decaying
sinusoid whose waveforms are entirely predictable. Such signals are said to
be deterministic either because their waveforms have been defined math-
ematically or because they correspond to observable physical events occur-
ring in carefully controlled circumstances. If 'x' (voltage, sound pressure,
particle displacement, etc.) is known at any instant, its value at any future
time is entirely predictable and its history is written. Truly deterministic
signals are rare except as a mathematical abstraction, but real signals are

Nonsinusoidal Waveforms 
121
often a reasonable approximation. If we recorded the waveform of a note
played on a piano, we would be justifiably surprised to find a very different
waveform on repeating the experiment. But there are signals whose wave-
form has no discernible pattern. The sequence of values of 'x' that consti-
tutes the waveform is random and no prediction can be made as to what
value of 'x' will follow another.
The concept of randomness is central to statistics. Its essence is not that
x can have any value (it cannot) but that the series of numbers formed by
taking successive values of x has no pattern. To explore this idea, think of
the random numbers made available by electronic calculators and com-
puters. Strictly speaking these are pseudo-random numbers; if we knew the
algorithms well enough, it might be possible to calculate one number given
the preceding one, and indeed the sequence of numbers from a given starting
point does recur. For most practical purposes, however, it is fair to say that
no underlying pattern is recognizable. The numbers are, nevertheless,
constrained. They usually fall in the range 0 to 1 (or just less) and, being
digitally generated, the least possible nonzero difference between any two
numbers depends on the precision of the calculation or display. The
important thing to realize is that although the numbers appear in an
haphazard sequence when called one after the other, the ensemble (or
population) to which they belong does have stable features. Its range, mean,
and standard deviation are known and can be estimated from samples. The
defining property of electronically generated random numbers of this kind
is that all values in the range 0 to 1 are equally likely. The probability
distribution is uniform. Equal likelihood is not, however, a prerequisite for
randomness. The height of the next man we encounter in the street is one
of a large set of random values, but he is unlikely to be a dwarf or a giant.
What is important so far as random waveforms are concerned is that the
signal at any given moment should be independent of the signal at any other
moment. As we shall see, such independence is unobtainable in real physical
systems but it can be approached as an approximation.
As we have said, noise is often associated with random events. We
therefore find random noise defined as 'Oscillation due to the aggregate of a
large number of elementary disturbances with random occurrence in time'
(IEC 60050-801). In many instances this kind of noise has its origins at a
molecular or even subatomic level. For example, the random collisions of
air molecules with the diaphragm of a microphone are a source of noise that
places an absolute limit on the least sound that can be measured.5 Similarly,
5This statement is not quite true, because certain signals, particularly recurrent ones, can be
recovered even if they are below the noise level of the measuring equipment. For example, the
auditory brainstem response is small compared with the electrical background recorded on
the surface of the head, but it can be detected by signal averaging.

122 Acoustics for Audiologists
a fluctuating electrical potential difference can be observed across the ends
of a resistor because of the random collisions between charged particles
(electrons) and the atomic matrix of the conducting material. Larger
potentials are generated at the junction of semiconducting materials in
diodes and other electronic components. Diode noise, greatly amplified of
course, provides the masking noise for audiometry. It would, however, be
wrong to think that all noise is random or at least approximately so. It is
often conspicuously nonrandom, as in the case of 'mains hum' from the
electrical supply. But random noise is an important category that is treated
extensively in engineering texts. It is also the basis of the signal-detection
theories of hearing.
The waveform representing noise in a specified interval does have a
Fourier transform. The spectrum is a characteristic of the noise. If the
spectrum is uniform, that is, if the spectral density is the same at all
frequencies, we can call the noise white noise by analogy with white light,
which is a more or less uniform mixture of light containing all wavelengths
in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. White noise is an
example of wide-band noise, so called because it contains a wide range of
frequencies. At the other extreme, where the spectrum is significant over
only a small range of frequencies, we say that the noise is narrow-band noise.
This type of noise is important in audiometry because it has the least
loudness for a given amount of masking. Other commonly used types of
noise are high-pass noise and low-pass noise having, respectively, only high
or low frequencies in their spectra. These forms of noise are often needed for
test purposes, particularly in diagnostic audiology, and they can be derived
from wide-band noise by filtering. Indeed the word pass as just used implies
that the specified characteristics have been obtained by passing the noise-
generating signal through a filter.
Filters
In the most general sense, a filter is a device whose purpose is to increase
or decrease an oscillation according to its frequency. If the signal is complex
(nonsinusoidal), then the modification depends on the distribution of
frequencies in its spectrum. Filters have many applications, particularly in
mechanics, optics, electronics, and acoustics. Their role in electronics is
especially important because electronic devices are used to handle signals
from a great variety of sources, including microphones and electrical sources
used in sound production, measurement, and recording. In this brief
reference to filters we will consider only the electronic kind.
Filters have an input and an output. If the input signal is a sinusoid, then
the output is also a sinusoid whose amplitude and phase depend on the

Nonsinusoidal Waveforms 
123
frequency. The ratio of the output signal to the input signal at a given
frequency is called the transfer factor of the filter.6 Filters are designed
either to reject or to pass signals whose frequencies fall in a specified
band or whose frequencies are above or below specified limits. As mentioned
earlier, the attributes band pass, high pass, and low pass describe the
characteristics of filters. A well-designed filter produces little gain or
attenuation and no change of phase in signals falling in its pass region.
Beyond these limits the amount of attenuation is either modest or
severe, depending on design, and the phase change is likely to approach
Â± 7T/2 for remote frequencies. The change of phase is often unimportant in
acoustics and unlikely to be perceived by the ear, which is rather insensitive
to phase, but it can be troublesome in other circumstances. Filters are
needed to reduce the noise that accompanies evoked potentials, and a
change in phase can lead to a change in the observed waveform, adding to
the difficulty of interpretation. The phase problem can be overcome using
digital filtering in which the Fourier spectrum of the signal is derived and
then modified in accordance with the required filter characteristics. The
output is obtained from the modified spectrum by calculating the inverse
transform. With modern electronics this sequence of events can be accom-
plished so rapidly that the time required for processing has often no
practical importance. This is what is meant by real-time processing. The
ability to process signals at such a speed is an essential part of digital
hearing aid technology.
There are several mathematical techniques for determining the effect of a
filter on the signals that pass through it. The easiest of these, conceptually,
is as follows. The Fourier transform of the input signal is obtained so that
the signal is replaced by sinusoids. The sinusoid at each frequency is then
multiplied by the transfer factor to give sinusoids whose amplitude and
phase differ from those in the original signal according to the design of the
filter. The inverse transform is then applied to derive the output signal.
Figure 5.5 shows the result of this type of calculation applied to the filtering
of a rectangular pulse by a simple low-pass filter comprising a resistance and
capacitance arranged as shown in the diagram. The filter attenuates the
high-frequency components of the input signal so that the rapid changes in
voltage at the beginning and end of the pulse are not transmitted.
It is interesting to consider what happens when seemingly random noise
is modified by a band-pass filter. The response characteristics of the filter
influence the rate at which the output signal is likely to change from
moment to moment. Rapid changes are associated with high-frequency
components of the signal, and these components are, by design, selectively
6The change in phase can be taken into account by expressing the transfer factor as a complex
number in a manner similar to complex impedance. (Impedance is discussed in Chapter 7.)

described in the text.
attenuated at frequencies above the pass band. The same is true in the
opposite sense for low-frequency components. If the bandwidth is large these
influences are unlikely to be evident on visual inspection of the waveform
(using an oscilloscope, for example), but if the bandwidth is narrow the
output has a distinctly sinus quality (Figure 5.6). Because all physical
instruments are band-limited to some degree, it follows that a truly random
waveform can never be observed.

The Speech Spectrum
Speech is produced by the flow of air from the lungs. In voiced speech this
flow is interrupted by the vocal folds to produce laryngeal tones. The vocal
folds open and close at rates of from 75 to 500 per second, depending on
intonation and voice quality. The average is about 120 interruptions per
second for men and 240 for women. The frequency content of speech
depends on the laryngeal tone and on the filtering effect of the throat,
mouth, and nasal cavities, which are continually modified in the act of
speaking. Resonances in the vocal tract reinforce sounds within particular
frequency bands. Several characteristic bands known as formants are
associated with vowels and diphthongs. The bandwidth in which resonance
occurs decreases with increasing duration of the utterance, so that the
longest vowels may be associated with bands of only a few hertz. Conson-
ants involve the production of turbulent airflow at some point in the vocal
tract, either by forcing the exhaled breath through a constriction or by
completely blocking the airflow and suddenly releasing it. They have been
described as transient or transitional sounds as distinct from the vowels,
which have a more sustained character. In terms of their frequency content,
they are not clearly distinguishable from vowels except that they are
generally weaker and tend to occupy a wider range of frequencies.
The frequency characteristics of particular speech sounds can be exam-
ined with the help of a speech spectrograph. This instrument samples speech
a few words at a time and generates a visible record showing how the sound
energy in a series of specified frequency bands varies from one moment to
the next. The record, which runs from left to right with increasing time,
shows the energy in each of the bands arranged vertically in ascending order
of frequency. The relative energy in each band at a given time is indicated
by modulating the display so that the strongest signals appear as black areas
while weaker signals are given progressively lighter shades. Figure 5.7 is an
example.
The speech spectrograph provides information about individual speech
sounds, but for a broader picture it is usual to turn to the so-called
long-term spectrum. This is used to assess the performance of communica-
tions systems such as telephones and radio transmissions and as a basis of
the formulae used to select hearing aids. The long-term spectrum is based
on samples of speech that contain a large number of words. It shows how,
on average, the acoustic energy in the speech varies with frequency. The
frequency scale can have various forms, but for hearing aid work it is often
convenient to employ a simple logarithmic scale. It is then logical to express
the spectrum as the energy in bands, such as third-octave bands, that have

a constant relative bandwidth throughout the frequency range. An example
of the long-term speech spectrum is shown in Figure 5.8.
Periodic Signals
A periodic signal is one that repeats itself over and over without change
from one cycle to the next. It may at first be rather surprising to find that
a periodic signal does not have a Fourier transform. The reason for this is
that anything that is truly periodic would have to be in existence, unchang-
ing, for all time. The transform of such a signal would give rise to an
infinitely wide spectrum that could not be defined (in technical language, its
Fourier integral does not converge). However, no physically observable
signal is periodic in the restricted sense implied here. All real signals have a

beginning and an end, or at least they change in some way as time passes.
We think of events as being periodic if they recur practically without change
for the duration of our interest in them, and it is often useful to obtain a
spectrum representation of such real signals.
It was remarked earlier that the spectrum of a damped harmonic
oscillation becomes narrower as the amount of damping is reduced. A
sinusoid that exists indefinitely is of course a fine example of a periodic
signal, and in the limit its spectrum degenerates to a line of zero bandwidth.
If we look at a more complex signal we see a similar pattern. Suppose that
we have a rectangular waveâthe sort of thing that is easily produced in
the laboratory with an ordinary signal generatorâand suppose that we
arrange things so that the signal decays progressively with time. Now
consider a sample of the signal taken over a time that is long compared with
the period of each cycle. The spectrum of the sample is a continuous band
of frequencies, but it has a structure related to the detail of the waveform.
It would look different, for example, if the rectangular waves were replaced
by triangles to make a sawtooth pattern. If the rate at which the signal
decays is made smaller, we find that the peaks and valleys in the spectrum
are accentuated; ultimately, as the rate of decay approaches zero, the
spectrum is reduced to a series of lines, as illustrated in Figure 5.9.
In general, the Fourier spectrum of a periodic signal is a line spectrum
called a Fourier series. Any periodic signal that corresponds to a real
physical process can be represented by such a series. The line spectrum

rectangular wave whose magnitude decays exponentially with time. The par-
ameter a is the decay constant. As this approaches zero, the peak-to-peak value
of the wave becomes constant to give a waveform in which cycles repeat exactly.
comprises sine and cosine terms whose phase is arbitrarily made equal to
zero at whatever moment we take to be the origin of the time axis. The
combination of these terms by simple addition produces the periodic
waveform. If the waveform has a period equal to T, the sine and cosine
vibrations in the series have frequencies that are multiples of the fundamen-
tal frequency 1/7! In other words, the Fourier series is an harmonic series.
The number of terms in the series is infinite, but the amplitudes diminish as
the series progresses, and the sum of the vibrations is finite.7 The series also
contains a constant (think of it as a cosine wave of frequency zero) whose
value is the average of the waveform over one cycle.
7An infinite series can have a finite sum. Achilles does catch Zeno's tortoise even though the
process requires an infinite number of (diminishing) steps. For example, the series 1 + 1/2 +
1/4 + 1/8 + . . .= 2.

Fourier series: construction of a rectangular wave by adding
sinusoids. In each example, n is the number of terms that have been added.
The Fourier series corresponding to a periodic rectangular wave whose
magnitude lies between plus and minus a is
where co = 2n/T and A = 4a/n. This happens to be a series containing only
sine terms because the cosine terms have zero amplitude. The constant is
also equal to zero because the wave is symmetrical (its positive and negative
parts have the same size and shape). The addition of the component
sinusoids and the reconstruction of the rectangular wave are illustrated in
Figure 5.10.
Sampling
So far we have considered only signals that are continuous in the sense of
being uninterrupted. Even signals, such as the rectangular wave, which have
sudden changes in level from one instant to the next are continuous
inasmuch as they are defined at any instant we care to nominate. There are
many occasions, however, when signals are recorded not as a continuum but
as a series of samples, taken usually at regular intervals. The processing and

of sampled data, but sampling does of course predate the electronic era. If
we are asked to draw a graph to represent some function, y = 2 + 3x2 for
example, we would start by constructing a table of values of y corresponding
to arbitrarily chosen values of x. We would then use the data in the table
to plot a series of points on a sheet of graph paper. Because in this example
we already know something of the underlying function, we would be
justified in joining the points with a smooth line. If, on the other hand, we
had been presented only with a table of values and had been given no
information about the source of the data, the construction of a smooth line
between the points would be an act of faith based on some assumption
about the relation between the y and x. The point to bear in mind is that,
in general, sampling provides only incomplete information and we need to
be careful how we interpret it. A particular difficulty arises if the sampling
rate is too low in comparison with the frequencies present in the sampled
waveform. When this happens we may get the false impression that a low
frequency is present when in fact the signal is at a much higher frequency.
This phenomenon is called aliasing. The way it comes about is illustrated in
Figure 5.11. To prevent aliasing, the sampling rate must be at least twice the
highest frequency present in the signal. Before sampling, it is a usual practice
to filter out components that do not meet this requirement.
Although there are exceptions, sampling usually involves the conversion
of the sampled data to digital form (analogue-to-digital or A-to-D conver-
sion). This again leads to a loss of information because the digital signal can
have only one of a set of possible values rather than any value that happens
to be present in the waveform at the moment of sampling. The digital
representation is in the form of a binary number. To see what this means,
consider first an ordinary decimal number such as the number 137. This

number can be written as (1 x 102) + (3 x 101) + (7 x 10Â°). We see there-
fore that the greatest number that can be represented by, say, three digits is
999, that is, 103 â 1. In general, the largest value that can be represented by
a decimal number having n digits is 10n â 1. Binary numbers are similar to
the familiar decimal numbers except that their base is 2 rather than 10. For
example, the binary number 1101 is equivalent to the decimal number
(1 x 23) + (1 x 22) + (0 x 21) + (1 x 2Â°) = 13. If there are n binary digits
(bits), then the highest possible number is 2" â 1. An analogue-to-digital
converter using 8 bits would provide values from 0 to (28 â 1), that is, from
0 to 255. If the original signal increased smoothly with time, the digitally
sampled signal would increase in steps corresponding to a change of 1/255
times the greatest signal level to be accommodated. Therein lies a difficulty,
because although a step of 1/255 may seem quite small (less than 0-5%), the
signal will not generally occupy the whole range of the converter; further-
more, some provision has to be made for dealing with positive as well as
negative values. Usually one of the 8 bits is used to this end, leaving only
127 levels in the positive or negative parts of the signal. Digital conversion
may therefore give rise to a significant coarseness in the sampled data.
Sampled data converted to digital form are ideal for machine processing.
This allows numerical methods to be used to carry out mathematical
operations that would otherwise be impossible. Examples include frequency
analysis and filtering.
The Discrete Fourier Transform
The discrete Fourier transform works with sampled rather than continuous
data. It leads to a spectrum containing a finite number of sine and cosine
waves which add to give the original waveform as it exists at the sampled
points. The corresponding spectrum is therefore a line spectrum. The
number of terms in the spectrum (including a constant, zero-frequency term)
is equal to the number of samples. By analogy with the discrete points that
make up a line plotted on a sheet of graph paper, we can regard the discrete
Fourier spectrum as the 'graph paper equivalent' of the standard (continu-
ous) Fourier transform. If the number of samples is sufficient, we find that
the two transforms give very similar results. An example is shown in Figure
5.12. Here the time function is a single pulse consisting of a quarter cycle of
a cosine wave. The function is zero at all times before and after the pulse.
The curve in the lower part of the figure shows the continuous Fourier
spectrum, and the circles show the discrete spectrum. The latter is based on
512 samples of the time function. For clarity, the diagram shows only every
third term up to the 126th in the series.

132 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 5.12 
Comparing the ordinary (continuous) Fourier transform (line) and a
discrete Fourier transform (circles) derived from 512 samples of the time function.
As with the Fourier series, the terms that make up the discrete transform
are harmonically related; that is, they are multiples of a fundamental
frequency. If the data contain N values sampled so that the first value occurs
at time zero and the Nth value occurs at time T, then the spectrum contains
a constant together with Nâ 1 terms at frequencies 1/NT, 2/NT, 3/NT, and
so on. Now although all these terms would be required for a mathematical
reconstruction of the original samples, only terms having frequencies up to
1/2N/NT, that is, 1/2T are physically meaningful. The remaining terms have
frequencies corresponding to less than two samples per cycle and so are
inadmissible according to the criterion stated previously. They are needed
in a mathematical sense, but they do not provide information about the fine
structure of the waveform. The remarkable thing about the discrete trans-
form is that no matter how few samples are taken (except that the minimum
number is two), addition of the sine and cosine terms gives a time function

FIG. 5.13

that passes exactly through the sample points. An example using just four
samples is shown in Figure 5.13. As demonstrated in this example, addition
of the sine and cosine terms leads to a periodic function containing the
original samples. It also contains replicas of these samples if the addition is
continued. The discrete Fourier transform should therefore be thought of as
a cyclic process that repeats itself at intervals equal to the time over which
samples were taken.
The discrete Fourier transform is immensely important in signal analysis.
One of the principal reasons for this is that algorithms have been invented

134 Acoustics for Audiologists
that enable the transform and its inverse to be calculated very rapidly using
microprocessor technology. For this reason the transform is often called the
fast Fourier transform (FFT). Audiological applications include frequency
analysis of otoacoustic emissions and, occasionally, auditory evoked poten-
tials, and digital filtering. The transform is an essential part of the processing
used in digital hearing aids.
The Co-Power Spectrum
When explaining the terminology used to describe a spectrum, it was stated
that the way in which acoustic power is distributed in a signal is given by
the power spectrum of the signal. Because power is proportional to the
square of the amplitude of vibration, an acoustic power spectrum consists
of terms whose magnitudes are proportional to the square of the sound
pressure at each frequency. The co-power spectrum is a variation on this
theme. Its importance for audiology is that it has become widely used as a
way of showing the energy distribution in otoacoustic emissions.
Let us assume that we have recorded the sound pressure in the ear canal
over a defined period (perhaps 20 ms) following an auditory stimulus. If this
recording were just a single curve showing the change in sound pressure
during the 20-ms period, we could obtain an ordinary power spectrum by
squaring the terms in its Fourier transform. A co-power spectrum, however,
requires two time functions as its starting point. We therefore begin by
making two independent measurements that lead to two versions, A and B,
of the pressure waveform. Now, however careful we are, the two curves will
not be identical because they will be contaminated by different samples of
the noise that inevitably accompanies any measurement. This means that
Fourier analysis of the two waveforms will lead, at each frequency, to two
vibrations, one having a pressure amplitude pA and the other having
amplitude pB according to their origin. These results could be combined by
calculating pApB instead of (pA)2 or (pB)2, but a more useful outcome can be
obtained if we also take into account the relative phase of the two
vibrations. Writing them as pA sin cot and pB sm(cot + </>) gives a term related
to acoustic power of the form pApB cos </>. This is the magnitude of the
co-power spectrum at the angular frequency co. Its importance is that its
value is greatest when the two waveforms are highly correlated so that
component vibrations in A have the same phase as those in B. The phase
difference </> is then zero and its cosine is equal to unity. The presence of
noise impairs the correlation and reduces the magnitude of the co-power
spectrum.

Recovering Signals in Noise:
Signal Averaging
There are many techniques that aid the detection of signals in the presence
of competing noise. The choice of method often depends on what is known
about the signal and about the noise. Biological signals such as evoked
potentials are often intimately related to the stimulus that produced them.
Their waveforms are repeated each time the stimulus is presented, and they
appear after exactly the same delay (latency) on each occasion. The
competing noise that makes these signals difficult to observe is generally
unrelated to the stimulus; it is this difference that makes it possible to
enhance the signals at the expense of the noise in order to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio. A favourite method is signal averaging. It is widely
used in the observation of evoked potentials such as the auditory brainstem
response and in the recording of otoacoustic emissions that follow an aural
stimulus. To understand how averaging works, it is first necessary to know
something about the noise. So that the discussion is not too general, we shall
limit it to the observation of otoacoustic emissions, but the same principles
apply to evoked potentials.
The noise reaching the microphone in the ear canal has several sources,
including environmental noise in the test area and respiratory, muscular,
and possibly vascular noise from the patient. Added to this is the electronic
noise generated within the microphone and its amplifiers and other circuit
components. The noise we observe is, then, an aggregate of contributions
from the various sources. If we sample this noise at intervals of a few tens
of milliseconds (the time between each stimulus), we expect to obtain a set
of values that are practically independent of one another. We may not know
much about the statistics of such samples, but because the microphone and
its amplifiers are sensitive only to alternating signals, we can expect the
average of the samples to have a value that approaches zero as the sample
size is increased. In statistical language, we would say that the samples of
the noise are taken from a population whose mean is zero. Now suppose we
sample the noise on, say, 100 occasions, each at a fixed time after the
stimulus. Let mi be the average of the 100 values so obtained. We can repeat
this process to obtain similar average values, m2, m3, and so on. In general
these averages will not be zero, but they will have positive and negative
values that deviate from zero by varying amounts according to chance. A
statistical measure of the likely deviation is called the standard deviation. It
is proportional to 1/^/N, where N is the size of the sample (100 in this case).
The average acoustic power in the noise is proportional to the square of the
standard deviation (the variance); that is, it is proportional to 1/N.

136 Acoustics for Audiologists
Suppose now that within the noise there is some unchanging component,
namely, the signal that we are attempting to identify. Because the signal is
constant, its average value will not depend on the size of the samples.
Averaging (signal + noise) therefore gives a result that consists of a constant
measure of the signal and an average of the noise which diminishes as the
sample size is made larger. The ratio of the power in the signal to that
remaining in the noise is proportional to N. If the signal is associated with
a sound pressure ps in the ear canal, and the noise, after averaging, is
associated with a sound pressure pN, then ps/pN is proportional to ^/N. The
improvement in the observed waveform is therefore proportional to the
square root of the number of samples in the average. Figure 5.14 provides
an illustration. Instead of taking a physiological signal as an example, an
arbitrary but easily recognized signal (a decaying cosine wave) has been
used. The diagram shows the progressive recovery of this signal as the
number of samples in the average is increased.
Linearity and Distortion
Distortion affects components such as transducers, amplifiers, and filters. It
is a failure to produce at the output a faithful copy of the signal at the input.
Although distortion may exist in both linear and nonlinear systems, it is
usually associated with nonlinearity. Thus, we should begin by examining
what is meant by linearity.
A system is said to be linear if a sinusoidal input leads to a sinusoidal
output. If a linear system is supplied with a sinusoidal input, the waveforms
of the input and output signals have the same shape (both are sinusoids)
and it follows that when the amplitude of the input is halved, or divided by
some other factor, the amplitude of the output is reduced in the same way.
A graph of the output against the input is therefore a straight line, in other
words, it is linear. A system that is linear for an input of a specified
frequency and amplitude may not be linear for an input at a different
frequency or a greater amplitude. Many systems are practically linear for
small inputs but nonlinear for large inputs. An obvious example is that of
an amplifier whose output is sinusoidal until the input is increased to a point
at which peak clipping sets in. Linearity is essential to the principle of
superposition and therefore to the principles of frequency analysis described
earlier. Although we have not made it explicit, the assumption has been that
when sinusoidal vibrations are added, the particle displacement (or other
related quantity) is the sum of the displacements that would be produced by
each of the component vibrations acting separately. This requires linear
behaviour.

Nonsinusoidal Waveforms 
137
FIG. 5.14 Signal averaging.
A perfectly linear system can produce distortion if its frequency response
is not uniform or if phase changes are introduced that depend on frequency.
The consequence is that when the input is not a sinusoid, the output
waveform will not be quite the same as the input waveform. These forms of
distortion are known as frequency distortion and phase distortion. The
former is not necessarily undesirable. An essential characteristic of hearing
aids, for example, is that they have a nonuniform frequency response that
provides selective amplification of sounds in certain frequency ranges.
Nonlinear distortion, on the other hand, is usually something to be avoided.

138 Acoustics for Audiologists
It exists whenever the output of a system is not directly proportional to the
input. Even if a sinusoidal signal is presented, a graph of the output against
the input will not be a straight line.
One of the consequences of nonlinearity is a form of distortion called
harmonic distortion. This occurs when the input is a periodic signal, and it
leads to the existence of frequency components in the output that are not
present in the input. Harmonic distortion is best measured by examining the
response to a sinusoidal input. The input then contains a single frequency,
f. The distorted output is a periodic, nonsinusoidal signal that can be
represented by a Fourier series whose components have the harmonic
frequencies, f, 2f, 3f, + â¢ â¢ â¢. With the help of filters, or by some other method
of analysis, we can measure the amplitudes (or rms values) of these
sinusoidal terms and, in the acoustic case, obtain the corresponding sound
pressures pl, p2, p3, + â¢ â¢ â¢. It is then customary to express the distortion as
a percentage using the following formula:
The distortion due to the nth harmonic is then
It can be seen that these formulae express the root mean square sound
pressure due to the unwanted harmonics relative to the root mean square
sound pressure in the output signal as a whole.
As an example of harmonic distortion, consider peak clipping, which is
likely to occur when an amplifier is overloaded. It is often brought about
deliberately in hearing aids to limit the output. Its effect in each cycle is to
prevent the output from exceeding some specified value (Figure 5.15). In its
most extreme form, infinite peak clipping, the signal is greatly amplified
before clipping so that the output waveform is almost rectangular. We can
easily calculate the harmonic distortion produced by infinite clipping
because we already know the Fourier series for a rectangular wave. The
result is

Nonsinusoidal Waveforms 
139
FIG. 5.15 
Peak clipping.
This is the greatest distortion that can be produced by peak clipping. Even
in hearing aid applications, we would normally want far less distortion,
though it is interesting to note that infinitely clipped speech is readily
intelligible to people with normal hearing. A total harmonic distortion of
less than 10% is probably acceptable. For audiometers, where a good-
quality signal is required, distortion should be less than 2.5% for air-
conducted tones and less than 5.5% for bone-conducted tones.
Another manifestation of nonlinearity is the creation of distortion prod-
ucts. Suppose that the input is the sum of two sinusoidal vibrations whose
frequencies are f1 and f2. It is found that the output contains vibrations
having these primary frequencies together with vibrations at frequencies
(mf1 â nf2), where m and n are integers. An important example of this
phenomenon is found in the cochlea. The response of the basilar membrane
is highly nonlinear, possibly because of motor activity in the outer hair cells.
If the ear is presented simultaneously with two pure tones, the vibrations
within the cochlea will include tones whose frequencies are of the kind just

140 Acoustics for Audiologists

Examples of transient distortion in response to a rectangular pulse.
The last example shows the pressure waveform in the ear canal following the
application of a rectangular voltage pulse to a miniature earphone used to elicit
otoacoustic emissions.
described. When such tones, arising from nonlinearity in the cochlea, are
detectable in the external ear, they are called distortion product otoacoustic
emissions. The amplitudes of distortion products depend on the amplitudes
and frequencies of the primary tones and on the nature of the nonlinearity.
In studies of cochlear physiology some products are more readily observable
than others. A favourite is one whose frequency is (2f1 â f2).
The kinds of distortion described so far exist when the input to a system
is a steady signal. When the input is a transient such as a pulse, or when in
effect it is a series of pulses as in a rectangular wave, a type of distortion
called transient distortion is often observed. It can occur when the frequency
response is not sufficiently uniform, and it shows itself as a lag in the
response, as an overshoot, or as a 'ringing', depending on the nature of the
signal and the frequency characteristics of the system. It is often seen in the
response of transducers such as earphones, and in audiological work it is
often influenced by the coupling between the ear and the earphone.
Examples are shown in Figure 5.16.

Modulated Signals
If we wish to send an audio signal from one place to another using, for
example, radio waves, it is usually necessary to do so by modulating a
sinusoidal carrier wave. This can be done in several ways, the most common
of which are amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM).
The carrier frequency is always much greater than the frequency of the
audio signal. In amplitude modulation, the amplitude of the carrier is made
to vary with the amplitude of the audio signal but the frequency of the
carrier is kept constant. In frequency modulation, it is the other way about:
the frequency of the carrier is varied according to the amplitude of the audio
signal but the amplitude of the carrier is unchanged.
Amplitude Modulation
The amplitude modulation of a carrier by a sinusoidal audio signal is shown
in Figure 5.17. Suppose that the unmodulated carrier signal has a voltage
amplitude Vc and an angular frequency GJC. At any time t the carrier voltage
is therefore given by
FIG. 5.17 Amplitude modulation.

142 Acoustics for Audiologists
Let the audio signal have an amplitude Va and angular frequency com and let
the signal have a cosine variation such that its voltage E is given by
When the carrier is modulated, its amplitude Vc is multiplied by
(1 + m cos comt), where m is a number called the modulation depth or
modulation index. This number is proportional to the amplitude va of the
audio frequency signal. It is generally less than 1 for all signal amplitudes
that are likely to be encountered. It may be expressed as a percentage. The
modulated carrier voltage is therefore
Therefore,
The product of the sine and cosine terms can be replaced by the sum of
two sine terms.8 Also, because m is proportional to Va, it can be replaced by
kVa, where k is a constant, to show the dependence on the amplitude of the
audio signal. With these changes we have
This result tells us that an amplitude-modulated signal contains a
component at the carrier frequency together with components at the carrier
frequency minus the audio frequency and at the carrier frequency plus the
audio frequency. In the foregoing description we have considered modula-
tion at a single angular frequency, com. In general, the audio information will
be contained in a band of frequencies from, let us say, f1 to f2 hertz. This
means that in addition to the carrier frequency fc, the modulated signal will
have components in frequency bands (fc â f1) to (fc â f2) and (fc + ft) to
(fc + f2)- These two ranges are called, respectively, the lower and upper
sidebands. Together, they define the range of frequencies that the trans-
mission system must be able to carry in order to convey the audio
information. It is, however, interesting to note that all the audio information
is contained in either the upper or the lower sideband, so that it is not
strictly necessary to include both. Single-sideband transmission in which the
carrier and one sideband are suppressed is often used in radiotelephony to
conserve bandwidth and to make more efficient use of the available power
in the transmission.
8 See Appendix A, Trigonometric Functions, Example 3.

Nonsinusoidal Waveforms 
143
Frequency Modulation
Frequency modulation is more difficult to accomplish than amplitude
modulation and requires a higher carrier frequency and wider bandwidth.
Its advantage over amplitude modulation is that audio signal reception is
insensitive to the unintended changes in carrier amplitude that inevitably
occur in transmission.
In frequency modulation, the angular frequency coc of the carrier fre-
quency is made to vary with changes in the amplitude of the audio signal.
The angular frequency o> of the modulated carrier signal is
where n is a constant (in units of radians per volt) and where the other
symbols have the same meanings as before. It can be shown that the voltage
of the modulated carrier is then given by V, where
In this expression ot,f is called the modulation index. It is equal to nVacoc/com.
Unless the modulating term is very small, the waveform is distinctly
nonsinusoidal. This makes it difficult to produce a diagram that illustrates
frequency modulation in a realistic way, particularly when the modulating
signal is a sinusoid. The process is more easily depicted if a rectangular wave
is used instead9 (Figure 5.18). As with amplitude modulation, sidebands are
produced, but they contain more than just the sum and difference frequen-
cies. The frequencies present in the modulated signal are fc (the carrier),
f c Â± f m , f c Â± 2fm, fc Â± 3fm, and so on. An alternative to frequency modula-
tion is phase modulation. It produces much the same result.
Pulse-Width Modulation
Pulse-width modulation is used with a carrier whose waveform is a train of
high-frequency rectangular pulses that are either positive or negative ac-
cording to the sense of the audio signal. The width of each pulse is made
proportional to the magnitude of the audio signal, as shown in Figure 5.19.
In this diagram the audio signal is a sinusoid, but only a small part of it is
shown so that the variation in pulse width can be seen clearly. Demodula-
tion is achieved by averaging the pulse train over a time that is long
compared with the interval between pulses but short compared with the
9The modulation of a carrier by a rectangular wave produces a signal having the same form
as that used to transfer information between Modems (a word formed by joining the two

period of the audio signal. Pulse-width modulation is used in the output
stages of class D hearing aid amplifiers. Its advantage over direct amplifica-
tion of the audio signal is that little or no current flows in the amplifier when
this signal is absent because the pulse width is then zero. Amplification is
therefore efficient and battery life is preserved. The output transducer
(miniature earphone) can itself act as the demodulator because it is quite
unresponsive to the high-frequency carrier signal but does of course respond
to the audio frequency average.

Questions and Exercises
Practical exercises are marked with an asterisk.
5.1 Distinguish between the time domain and the frequency domain in the
description of acoustic or electrical signals. Describe in a non-
mathematical way the action of the Fourier transform and its inverse.
5.2 What is meant by a spectrum? What is the difference between a line

5.4* What is a random number? The variance of the sampled values of a
signal is proportional to the power in the signal during the interval in
which the samples were taken. The following statistical experiment
mimics the measurement of power in a random signal whose magni-
tude at any instant is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. (We have
not specified a physical unitâit could be a volt or a pascal, for
example.) Using a calculator or spreadsheet, generate random numbers
in the range 0 to 1. Find the mean and variance of a sample comprising
N of these numbers. Continue to add data to your sample and draw a
graph showing the progress of the mean and variance as N increases.
The mean should approach 1/2 and the variance should approach
1/12, as the sample size becomes large. Note: the variance is the average
squared deviation from the mean. If you have N values of a number
x, the mean M and variance V are given by
Some calculators and spreadsheets have statistical routines that can
calculate the mean and variance for you at each stage.
5.5 A sawtooth wave consists of a voltage that rises slowly from zero to a

5.6* Laboratory equipment is needed. Use an audiometer or other supply
as a source of wide-band noise. Make a direct electrical connection to
the output of the source and display the noise on an oscilloscope.
Observe the effect of inserting narrow-band filters (third-octave will
do).
5.7 A voltage waveform consists of a continuous train of rectangular waves
in which the voltage alternates between plus and minus 1 volt. The

adapt them to suit other languages if necessary. Where you see 'etc.',
copy the formula to the remaining cells in the column. Make the
following entries in the spreadsheet:

I, [ = F5 + 15, etc.] (first four terms of the series).
In column K add the contents of corresponding cells in columns G and
J, [ = G5 + J5, etc.], (first five terms in the series).
Chart the numbers in columns H to K on the y-axis using the numbers
in column B on the x-axis. You can, of course, extend the synthesis to
include higher terms. If so, it will be quicker to include more than one
term in each column. The general term is (1/r) x sin(nc), where x is the

Measuring Sound
General Principles
Sound has many attributes that are amenable to physical measurement, and
even perceptive qualities such as pitch and loudness can often be expressed
in physical units by reference to established psychometric scales. The
attributes most important for audiology fall into two broad classes: those
that are energy related and those that are frequency related. Frequency
analysis was considered in the previous chapter; so far as measurement itself
is concerned, there is little of fundamental importance that we need consider.
Once a representative signal has been obtained, frequency measurement and
analysis are for the most part the subject of electronic equipment and signal
processing technologies rather than acoustics and we shall not give them
further attention except to note that frequency meters, wave analysers, and
the like can receive their input directly from sound-generating and sound-
measuring equipment. Energy-related measurements, on the other hand, are
an important part of acoustic science. Because such measurements usually
lead to a result expressed in decibels, it is appropriate to begin by describing
how decibel scales are constructed and used.
Decibels
It is conventional and convenient to express the sound power radiated by a
source, or the energy- or power-related quantities measured in a sound field,
with reference to a logarithmic scale.1 The fundamental scale unit is the bel,
but it is seldom used. One tenth of it, the decibel (symbol dB), is the popular
choice whose use is virtually ubiquitous throughout acoustic measurement.
Three reasons are often given for preferring a logarithmic scale:
1. The response of the human ear is said to be logarithmic. What this
usually means is that loudness is proportional to the logarithm of
sound intensity.
1Help with logarithms and a brief description of logarithmic scales are given in Appendix A.

2. When a signal passes through a system, the gain or attenuation in
successive stages can be treated as addition or subtraction instead of
multiplication and division.
3. Acoustic measurements encompass an unusually large range of magni-
tudes, and logarithmic scaling is a very convenient method for dealing
with the difficulty that this creates.
There is some truth in the first of these, but the power law for loudness is
valid for only part of the intensity range of sounds normally encountered,
and loudness depends as much on frequency and bandwidth as it does on
acoustic intensity. The second reason is valid but not compelling; it is the
third that is the most important. The need to accommodate wide-ranging
values is not just a problem for acoustics. Logarithmic scales exist else-
whereâ to express the brightness of stars (stellar magnitudes) or the
strength of earthquakes (the Richter scale), for example.
The basis of the decibel scale is the logarithmic expression of the power
Wn of an acoustic source relative to a reference power W0. We say that the
power of the source is n decibels above that of the reference if
It is important to understand that the decibel is not an absolute unit of
acoustic power but an expression of the ratio of one acoustic power to
another. Once the reference power is specified, a scale of acoustic power
relative to that reference is established and the word level may be used to
show that a particular value is referred to the scale. The number n then
denotes a sound power level relative to W0. If, for example, a source has an
output of 300 \JL W, its sound power level relative to a microwatt is
The sound power radiated through a unit area is the sound intensity, I.
The intensity at any point in a sound field is proportional to the power
radiated by the source, and therefore I can replace W in Equation 6.1, with
the result that
For sound measurements in air it is customary to choose 10 -12 Wm -2 as
the reference intensity. Unless some other value is specified, this reference
may be assumed, thus making n a sound intensity level relative to the
reference intensity.

Measuring Sound 151
The squared values of field quantities such as sound pressure and particle
velocity are often proportional to the power of the sound source, so that W
in Equation 6.1 can be replaced by p2 to give
Remembering that log xm = m log x, we notice that this can also be written
as
Equations 6.2a and 6.2b are therefore alternative ways of expressing what is
known as sound pressure level. The reference pressure is 20//Pa. Sound
pressure level enjoys a special place in acoustic measurement and particu-
larly in audiology, where decibel scales are found in abundance. Its name is
usually abbreviated to SPL. When these initials follow the abbreviation for
the decibel, a sound pressure level referred directly to 20//Pa without
frequency weighting or other qualification is implied. As an example, the
sound pressure level corresponding to a sound pressure of 0.3 mPa is
To give an example of the conversion from decibels to absolute units, the
sound pressure corresponding to 50 dB SPL is found as follows:
Therefore,
so that
Therefore,
The choice of 20 juPa as the standard reference sound pressure may seem
curious, but the explanation is as follows. The sound intensity in a plane
wave is p2/p0c, where p0 is the density of air and c the speed of sound. The

152 Acoustics for Audiologists
product p0c is the characteristic impedance, which has a value close to
400 Nsm~3. Accordingly, a sound pressure of 20/iPa corresponds to an
intensity of (20 x 10~6)2/400 = 10~12 Wm~2, which is the reference level
for sound intensity given earlier. The sound pressure level at the threshold
of hearing for a 1-kHz tone is approximately2 0 dB SPL.
In sound production and measurement there is often occasion to measure
some nonacoustic quantity (usually electrical) that is related to sound
pressure. The current flowing in the coil of a loudspeaker or the voltage
produced by a microphone are examples. We can extend decibel notation
to include such quantities. For example, voltage levels can be defined in a
way exactly analogous to sound pressure level, namely,
If, for instance, we record a voltage of 5 mV, we could express the result as
Decibel notation provides a convenient way of making comparisons. To
give an example, suppose that we measure the sound pressure at two places
in the field of a simple source. At 100 mm from the source, the sound
pressure level is, say, 50 dB. What value would be expected at a distance of
3 metres? Let the sound pressure levels at the two distances be n1 dB and
n2 dB, corresponding to absolute pressures p1 and p2. Then
The difference in sound pressure level is therefore
If the radiation consists of free, spherical waves, we expect the sound
pressure to be inversely proportional to the distance from the source, so that
p2/P1 = 0.1/3. Substituting the numerical values then gives
The sound pressure at 3 metres is therefore 29.5 dB less than the sound
2It is actually slightly greater. The minimum audible field for a 1-kHz tone (plane wave, frontal
incidence, binaural) is 4.2 dB.

Measuring Sound 153
pressure at 0.1 metres; that is, 50 - 29.5 = 20.5 dB SPL. Notice that the
reference pressure cancels in the calculation of the difference n2 â n1
Decibel notation is so helpful that it is used liberally in acoustics and
electrical engineering, but it has to be admitted that basic principles are
frequently overlooked in the pursuit of convenience. When is a decibel not
a decibel? Here is an example. The gain of an amplifier or, indeed, the
pressure gain between the eardrum and the oval window may be given in
decibels. Although it is quite correct to say that voltage gain is V2/Vl
or that pressure gain is p2/P1, these ratios are not equal to the power
delivered by the amplifier divided by the power supplied to its input, or to
the power delivered to the cochlea divided by that received at the eardrum.
Suppose that instead of an amplifier we had a simple electrical transformer.
It comprises just two coils of wire and a ferromagnetic core, and although
the output voltage differs from the input voltage, no energy is added. In fact,
some energy is lost as heat in the coils because of their resistance. Now, a
decibel expresses the ratio of one acoustic or electrical power to another,
and to talk about the gain of an amplifier in decibels is questionable unless
we are careful to state that we really do mean watts out divided by watts
in. The same caution applies to the middle earâit is a transformer, not an
amplifier. It improves sound transmission to the cochlea but does not
contribute energy itself. Although the improper use of the decibel may be
criticised, some would think it pedantry to insist that only true power ratios
may be so expressed. Departure from the path of true righteousness is
allowed if it is done thoughtfully.
Another area where care is needed is in the measurement of quantities
that are not averages. Looking ahead to the description of sound-level
meters, it may be noted that such instruments measure the mean squared
value of the sound pressure. This is proportional to acoustic power or
intensity averaged over the 'integrating time' of the meter. In order to obtain
a correct result, the reference sound pressure must therefore be a root mean
square pressure. There is no difficulty in this except that at the turn of a
switch the meter might be made to measure a sound level corresponding to
the peak sound pressure instead of the rms, and a greater numerical value
would be displayed. The power in the sound field has not changed. The
change in the display (3 dB for a sinusoid) should be interpreted as a decibel
expression of the ratio of the peak power to the average.
Other Decibel Scales Used in Audiology
Audiology uses a number of decibel scales that do not have 20 /iPa as the
reference sound pressure. Among the most important are those related to

154 Acoustics for Audiologists
the threshold of hearing. We should be careful to distinguish between scales
that represent the level of a stimulus and those that are characteristic of the
listener. The former include hearing level and sensation level.
Hearing level (dB HL) in its most general meaning is the level of a
stimulus referred to its level at what is taken to be the threshold of hearing
for normal listeners. When the stimulus is a pure tone presented in a
specified manner in a free field or by an earphone, the normal threshold of
hearing is specified by international agreement. For other kinds of stimulus,
where no national or international consensus exists, the user has to
determine the reference threshold by experiment with a statistically ad-
equate number of otologically normal individuals.
Considerable effort has been made to standardize the threshold for pure
tones, especially those presented through earphones. This has led to defini-
tions of hearing level that are somewhat narrower than the one just given,
with specific reference to earphones and bone vibrators. To give the hearing
level scale some practical meaning, it is necessary to define its zero with
respect to sound pressure levels or vibratory force levels measured in
acoustic or mechanical couplers. This involves the specification of what are
called reference equivalent sound pressure (or force) levels. This subject will
be discussed in more detail in Chapter 8.
Sensation level (dB SL) is the sound pressure level of a stimulus referred
to its level at the threshold of hearing of the individual subject. The hearing
level of a stimulus is greater than the sensation level by a number of decibels
equal to the subject's hearing threshold level (see later in this section).
Other scales describe the level of the sound itself rather than as a property
of the individual listener. One of these is loudness level, which is measured
in phons. A full definition is given later in this chapter. Another is called
effective masking level or just masking level.
Masking level (dB) is, for a specified masking sound, the number of
decibels by which the hearing threshold level of a normal listener would be
raised by the presence of the masker. In order to calibrate audiometers, the
sound pressure levels corresponding to the 0-dB masking level have been
standardized for certain classes of band-pass noise as they affect the hearing
thresholds for pure tones (see Chapter 8).
Examples of scales related to characteristics of the listener are hearing
threshold level and uncomfortable loudness level.
Hearing threshold level (dB HTL) expresses the hearing threshold of an
individual relative to the hearing threshold of normal listeners. It is
numerically equal to the level in dBHL of a stimulus that is just audible to
the individual. An audiogram is a graph of the subject's hearing threshold
levels plotted against frequency.
Uncomfortable loudness level (ULL) expresses an individual's tolerance of

Measuring Sound 155
loud sounds. It is numerically equal to the hearing level of a stimulus
at the point where it is judged to be uncomfortably loud. The reference level
is the normal threshold of hearing. The uncomfortable loudness level
therefore relates the listener's perception of loudness to the hearing level
scale. This makes it easy to show uncomfortable loudness levels on the
audiogram.
Microphones
Microphones provide the primary input to all systems used in recording,
amplifying, and measuring sound. In one way or another they convert sound
pressure into an electrical signal. Designs vary greatly according to applica-
tion, but certain features are common. Nearly all microphones have a
diaphragm that moves in response to the alternating force created by the
action of the sound pressure over its surface. In some cases the movement
is passed to a transducer such as a piezoelectric crystal or to a coil moving
through a magnetic field; in others the diaphragm itself is part of the
transducer. The diaphragm and its attachments constitute a mechanical
system having significant mass and elasticity and therefore capable of free
oscillation. Its motion may have to be damped by adding resistive elements
to control the response in the neighbourhood of the resonance frequency.
The ideal microphone would have a uniform frequency response with no
phase distortion or nonlinear distortion throughout its operating range. In
reality, compromises have to be made. A distinctly nonuniform response can
be tolerated in, for example, telephones, dictating machines, and pagers in
exchange for desirable electrical characteristics such as high sensitivity and
low electrical impedance. Indeed, in these applications a restriction of the
bandwidth to frequencies important for speech might be advantageous in
reducing noise and in simplifying the requirements for the amplification and
transmissions of signals. Hearing aid microphones are often designed to
provide a nonuniform response appropriate to the hearing loss. It is in
precision acoustic measurement that demands are most stringent. Here the
ability to produce a true electrical facsimile of the input waveform is often
the principal requirement.
We have hitherto used the terms response and sensitivity quite freely
without definition, making the assumption that their meanings are self-
evident. These terms are, however, used many times over in describing the
characteristics of microphones and associated measuring systems, and
formal definitions are therefore appropriate. The following are taken from
IEC 60050:

stimulus (excitation) under specified conditions. The kinds of input and output
being utilized must be specified.
sensitivity (of a transducer), the quotient of a specified quantity describing the
output signal of the transducer by another specified quantity describing the
corresponding input signal.
When we apply these terms to the performance of a microphone, we can
use response to mean the output voltage from the microphone as a result of
sound pressure on the diaphragm. The term can apply at a chosen frequency
or over a range of frequencies. For the latter, we talk of a frequency response,
although for brevity the word frequency can often be omitted. The word
sensitivity means specifically the ratio of the output voltage to the input
sound pressure. The sensitivity M of a microphone is therefore the rms
voltage V at its output divided by the rms sound pressure p being measured;
that is,
The Condenser Microphone
The condenser microphone is almost unrivalled as a transducer for high-
quality measurements of sound pressure and the accurate reproduction of
pressure waveforms. The simplicity of its form and the wonderful perfection
of its construction put it among the most beautiful of man-made things. The
fundamental reason for its importance in acoustic measurement is its high
stability and uniform frequency response. Its diaphragm, which is very light
and unencumbered by attachments, is very responsive to changes in pres-
sure. Below the resonance frequency (which may be 10 kHz or more), the
movement of the diaphragm is controlled mainly by the elasticity of the
diaphragm itself and that of the air in the microphone capsule, to give a
displacement proportional to sound pressure. The electrical output of the
microphone is proportional to this displacement and therefore to sound
pressure; accordingly, the response is inherently uniform over a wide range
of frequencies.
The construction of a condenser microphone is shown schematically in
Figure 6.1. It consists of a taut metal diaphragm in close proximity to a fixed
backplate. These components form the electrodes of a parallel-plate conden-
ser whose capacitance changes with the deflection of the diaphragm.
Standard measuring microphones have nominal diameters of 1, 1/2, or 1/4
inches. The diaphragm itself is often made from metal foil (e.g. aluminium,
stainless steel, or nickel) with a thickness of typically 2 to 8 /mi, stretched

to a tension of the order of 104 Nm"1. The gap between the diaphragm and
the backplate is very small, perhaps 15 to 30 [im. It will be evident from
these figures that the construction of the microphone calls for precision
engineering of a high order. The diaphragm is connected electrically to the
capsule, but the backplate, which forms the second electrode, is insulated
from it. An insulation of typically 1015 ohms is achieved by mounting the
backplate in quartz, or polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE), or sometimes ruby. It
is necessary to vent the microphone capsule to prevent the creation of a
static pressure difference across the diaphragm. The vent, consisting of a
capillary with a wire insert, offers a high acoustic resistance so that the
incident sound has its effect on only the outer surface of the diaphragm. The
acoustic isolation is not absolute, however, so for very low frequencies
(below 10 Hz) the sound pressure inside the capsule becomes significant.
Venting and other deliberately engineered leakage determines the lower
limit of the frequency range in which the microphone can work, regardless
of the quality of the electrical connections. An example of a condenser
microphone is shown in Figure 6.2.
Because the condenser microphone is so important as a primary standard
for acoustic sound measurement, it is worth considering its operation in
some detail. The capacitance of a parallel-plate condenser is given by
where e0 is a constant (the permittivity of air), A is the surface area of each
plate, and d is the distance between the plates. The condenser of the
microphone is charged by the application of a polarizing voltage, typically
of the order of 200 volts. Call this voltage E. If the capacitance of the

microphone is Cm, the charge Q stored on it is then given by
We consider first what happens under open-circuit conditions, that is,
without leakage and with all electrical connections to the capacitor re-
moved. In these circumstances the charge must be constant. Suppose that a
positive sound pressure acts on the diaphragm, causing an inward deflection
x which reduces the distance between the plates to d â x. This will be
accompanied by a voltage change V so that the total voltage on the plates
becomes E + V. Because the charge remains unchanged, it follows that
Therefore,
where the minus sign shows that the voltage on the condenser decreases
when x is made larger.
To use the microphone, its output must be connected to an amplifier (a
preamplifier) and to a charging circuit that replaces the charge lost through
leakage and as current supplied to the amplifier. A simplified circuit is
shown in Figure 6.3. In this circuit the source of the charging voltage is

shown schematically as a battery, though in practice an electronic power
supply would be used. The charge is delivered through a very high
resistance, Rc. Stray capacitance in the microphone capsule and in the
connectors and cables is represented by Cs. The input capacitance and
resistance of the preamplifier are shown as Ca and Ra. The capacitance of
the microphone itself is Cm. The only other component is the coupling
capacitor Cu, which has no effect except to remove the charging voltage
from the input to the preamplifier.
In the absence of sound, all voltages in the circuit are constant and no
current flows in any component once the capacitors are charged. When
sound is present, the varying voltage on the condenser causes small
alternating currents to flow in all parts of the circuit. The sum of these
alternating currents is the current flowing through the microphone
capacitance, Cm. The microphone can therefore be treated as a simple
alternating-current generator whose open-circuit voltage is V and whose
internal impedance3 is that of the microphone capacitance. Accordingly, the
circuit in Figure 6.3 is equivalent to the one drawn in Figure 6.4. It can be
shown that the voltage V0 at the input to the preamplifier is given by
where C = Cm + Cs + Ca and R = RCRa(RC + Ra). If the charging resis-
tance and the input resistance of the preamplifier are very high, then
3Impedance is a generalized form of resistance that applies to components carrying alternating
currents. The impedance of the condenser is âj/o)Cm. See Chapter 7.

coRC Â» 1 at all frequencies in the normal operating range of the micro-
phone. In this case the fraction to the right of the second multiplication sign
in the previous expression is practically equal to unity, so that we are left
with
We see from this equation that the output voltage of a condenser
microphone is proportional to the displacement of its diaphragm. The
relationship between displacement and sound pressure depends on the
internal mechanical and acoustic properties of the microphone, but at
frequencies well below resonance we can expect displacement to be indepen-
dent of frequency and to have the same phase as the pressure. At high
frequencies, however, the pressure waveform is less faithfully reproduced
because the mass of the diaphragm and the air in the capsule become
significant. In a well-designed measuring microphone, the vibration of the
diaphragm in the neighbourhood of the resonance frequency is heavily
damped by the flow of air through small holes in the backplate and by other
mechanisms. The controlling force is then resistive so that displacement and
output voltage lag the sound pressure, causing phase distortion. Above
resonance the vibration is increasingly mass controlled, causing the output
to fall and the phase lag to increase (Figure 6.5).

Measuring Sound 161
FIG. 6.5 Typical pressure, free-field, and phase characteristics of a 1-inch
microphone (Briiel & Kjaer type 4145). The microphone in this example is
intended for free-field use. The fall in the pressure response above 1 kHz
compensates for diffraction in the sound field to give a uniform free-field response
for frontally incident plane waves (see Figure 6.16). The phase response is based
on a calculation that assumes critical damping. It shows that the displacement of
the diaphragm lags the sound pressure. The lag is 90Â° at the resonance frequency
(10 kHz); it increases with frequency beyond the range shown in the graph,
approaching 180Â° in the limit. (Redrawn from diagrams supplied by Briiel & Kjaer.)
There are three further observations can be made on the theory of the
condenser microphone. The first is that a capacitative load, associated with
connectors and cables and with the preamplifier itself, influences the output
voltage through the total capacitance C as shown by Equation 6.3. An
increase in this capacitance reduces the output but does not alter the
frequency response insofar as there are no frequency-dependent terms in the
equation.
The second observation is to call attention to the assumption that the
microphone capacitance Cm has been treated as a constant in the equivalent
circuit (Figure 6.4). This is of course an approximation, because if the
capacitance were exactly constant the microphone would have no output.
Although the separation of the diaphragm and backplate is very small, the
deflection of the diaphragm is even smaller, but at extremely high sound
levels it is not quite true to say that the microphone is simply a voltage
source in series with a fixed capacitance. The inherent nonlinearity asso-
ciated with a capacitance that depends on a changing dimension is a source
of distortion. For most measuring microphones, however, distortion is likely
to be negligible in all audiological applications.

162 Acoustics for Audiologists
Our third observation is that the output voltage from the microphone is
inverted if the polarity of the charge is reversed (if E is replaced by â E in
Equation 6.3). In audiological work we frequently wish to examine the
waveform of the transient signals used as the stimulus for evoked potentials
and otoacoustic emissions. When the trace on an oscilloscope is deflected
upwards from the baseline, is the sound pressure positive or negative? There
is no simple answer or convention. For equipment from one major manu-
facturer at least, a positive-going output is usually (but not always)
associated with a negative sound pressure.
Electret Microphones
The polymer 'cling film' used for food wrapping adheres to surfaces by
electrostatic attraction. Charged films known as electret can be used in
condenser microphones to supply the polarizing charge, thereby making it
unnecessary to have an external polarizing circuit. The charged film either
replaces the conventional metal diaphragm or is attached to the surface of
the backplate. Miniature electret microphones are widely used in hearing
aids. In the example of a hearing aid microphone shown in Figure 6.6, the
electret is applied to the backplate. The preamplifier (a junction field-effect
transistor) is contained within the microphone capsule, keeping stray
capacitance to a minimum and providing the user with a microphone/
preamplifier combination in a single convenient package.
Piezoelectric Microphones
Certain crystalline and ceramic materials generate a voltage when subjected
to mechanical strain. The phenomenon is known as the piezoelectric effect.
It provides a useful and often inexpensive mechanical-to-electrical conver-
sion in many applications, including microphones. The transduction works
in both directions: the dimensions of a piezoelectric element change when a
voltage is applied across its surfaces (Figure 6.7).
The piezoelectric effect is particularly strong in crystals of Rochelle salt
(potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate), and this material is used as the
transducing element in low-cost crystal microphones. It provides good
sensitivity but is easily damaged by heat and moisture. Piezoelectric ceram-
ics (barium titanate and particularly lead zirconate titanate [PZT]) are less
sensitive but far more stable. They can be manufactured in almost any size
and shape to suit many different applications, including vibration and force
transducers and the so-called ceramic microphones that are often used in
sound-level meters.

Measuring Sound 163
FIG. 6.6 Electret hearing aid microphoneâschematic cross section and typical
frequency response. (Based on a drawing supplied by Knowles Electronic Com-
pany.)
Crystals and ceramics, being solids, are very dense and unyielding
compared with air, so that a 'mechanical transformer' is often needed to
produce an adequate mechanical strain in response to sound pressure. A
favourite technique is to make the piezoelectric element from two parts
resembling a bimetallic strip. An element made in this way is called a
bimorph.4 If a straight bimorph element is bent to form a curve, the inner
section is compressed and the outer section is stretched and a voltage
difference is generated between the exposed surfaces. Considerable mechan-
ical advantage can be obtained by mounting the bimorph as a cantilever and
applying the action of the microphone diaphragm to the free end (Figure 6.8).
The Moving-Coil Microphone
The microphones described so far have a number of disadvantages over
other types. In the first place they are not particularly robustâa high-
4Bimorph is a registered trade name.

164 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 6.7 Piezoelectric ceramics. In this example the material is a rectangular
block whose cross section is shown in the diagram. When the block is com-
pressed by applying a force to opposite sides, a voltage appears between the
upper and lower faces. Conversely, applying a voltage between these faces
causes the block to expand laterally. The material is internally polarized during
manufacture. The direction of polarization is called the poling axis.
quality condenser microphone certainly has to be treated with respect.
Another problem is that they produce relatively small amounts of electrical
energy and present their amplifiers with a high impedance. The problem is
greatest for condenser microphones, which always require a preamplifier,
but even ceramic types may be intolerant of lengthy cables between
themselves and the amplifier. The moving-coil microphone, on the other
hand, is a robust and fairly massive instrument that can take a certain
amount of rough handling. Its output impedance is very low (a few tens of
ohms) so that it is unaffected by the capacitance of connectors and cables.
A useful increase in output voltage can be obtained using a step-up
transformer.

Measuring Sound 165
FIG. 6.8 Ceramic microphone.
In principle, the moving-coil microphone works like a moving-coil
earphone or loudspeaker operated in reverse. The microphone is also called
an electrodynamic (or just dynamic) microphone. As with a loudspeaker, the
diaphragm supports a coil that moves in through the radial field of a
permanent magnet, and therefore the induced voltage is proportional to the
velocity of the coil. It follows that the frequency response will be uniform if
the velocity of the diaphragm is proportional to the sound pressure acting
on it. As will be explained in the next chapter, this means that the
mechanical impedance at the diaphragm has to be resistive. The movement
of the diaphragm is controlled by the elastic compliance of its mountings,
by its inertia, by interaction with the air inside the microphone capsule, and
by porous damping elements. It is possible to design these components in
such a way that the movement of the diaphragm is opposed by a force that
is proportional to its velocity throughout most of the intended frequency
range (Figures 6.9 and 6.10). Dynamic microphones are often contained in
a spherical housing to control diffraction effects.

Directional Microphones
Ribbon Microphone
The ribbon microphone, like the dynamic microphone, generates an electri-
cal signal through the movement of a conductor in a magnetic field, but the
mechanical and acoustic elements are designed to give a response that
depends, not on the sound pressure itself, but on the rate at which sound
pressure changes with distance, that is, on the pressure gradient in the sound
field. To understand what is meant by pressure gradient, imagine the sound
field as it exists at a given instant. The pressure in the field varies from one
point in the field to another. The rate of change of pressure with distance in
a specified direction is the pressure gradient in that direction. We have
previously measured distance from the source of sound along the direction
of propagation of the sound wave and have called this the x-direction. If a
wave is travelling along the positive x-axis away from the source, we can
write the sound pressure as
where a is the pressure amplitude and co and k have their usual meanings
(see Chapter 3). Readers familiar with calculus will see from this that the
rate of change of pressure with the distance x is given by
The pressure gradient is therefore an alternating quantity having the same
harmonic variation as other acoustic quantities such as sound pressure or
particle velocity, and because k = co/c, it must have a root mean square
value that is proportional to frequency. Pressure gradients in directions
parallel to a wavefront are likely to be small compared with gradients in the

Measuring Sound 167
direction of the propagation and we should expect the response of a
pressure-gradient microphone to be highly directional unless the sound field
is diffuse.
The ribbon microphone consists of a corrugated metal ribbon stretched
lightly between the poles of a magnet (Figure 6.11). Both surfaces of the
ribbon are exposed to sound, but the presence of a baffle between the front
and back of the microphone forces the sound to travel a greater distance to
reach the back of the ribbon than to reach the front, assuming it is facing
the source. The delay introduces a phase difference between the pressures on
the two faces of the ribbon, and there is therefore a net force available to set
it in motion. This force is proportional to the frequency of the sound so long
as the dimensions of the microphone are small compared with the
wavelength. The voltage generated between the ends of the ribbon depends
on the velocity at which it moves through the magnetic field, so to obtain a
uniform frequency response it is necessary to make this velocity propor-
tional to the reciprocal of the frequency. The frequency terms will then

Velocity-gradient (ribbon) microphone. The baffle shown in the lower
part of the figure is represented schematically. In reality it is formed by the magnet
assembly and microphone housing. In the orientation shown, sound incident
directly on face A of the ribbon has to pass around the baffle to reach face B. This
creates a difference in sound pressure across the ribbon, causing it to move in
the magnetic field to produce the output voltage V.

168 Acoustics for Audiologists
cancel. If the suspension is very compliant and the damping negligibly small,
the movement of the ribbon is controlled primarily by its mass. In other
words, the resonance frequency of the ribbon is designed to be below the
working range of the microphone (below what is audible). In these circum-
stances its velocity in response to the pressure difference across it is, as
required, proportional to 1/co.
It can be shown that the output of a ribbon microphone corresponds
more closely to the velocity of sound particles than to sound pressure. For
this reason it is sometimes called a velocity microphone. In a plane wave the
distinction between a velocity-sensitive microphone and one that is pressure
sensitive is immaterial because particle velocity and sound pressure are
proportional to one another and in the same phase. This is not true,
however, in a divergent fieldâclose to the source of spherical waves, for
exampleâand in these circumstances a velocity microphone will produce a
greater output than a normal microphone. The two instruments would give
completely different indications in a standing wave. For instance, at a
pressure node an ordinary pressure-sensitive microphone would give a low
indication, whereas a velocity microphone would give a high indication
because pressure nodes coincide with velocity antinodes.
The ribbon microphone is not particularly important for audiological
purposes, but it is useful to know about it because of its interesting
directional properties, particularly when used in conjunction with the
dynamic microphone. Similar principles apply to the directional micro-
phones used in hearing aids, although their construction is entirely different.
It can be shown that when the ribbon microphone is exposed to plane
waves, its response varies as the cosine of the direction from which the waves
are incident, that is, as the cosine of the azimuth 9. This is illustrated in
Figure 6.12. If v is the output voltage of the microphone when the sound
pressure is p, then we can say that its sensitivity to directly incident sound
is v/p. Call this ratio M0, adding the subscript to indicate that it is the
sensitivity when the microphone is facing the source of sound (azimuth
equals zero). The sensitivity for sound arriving from the direction 6 is then
M0 cos 6. Now suppose we have an ordinary dynamic microphone whose
response is nondirectional. This uniform response can be guaranteed, at
least in the horizontal plane, by positioning the microphone so that its
diaphragm is horizontal. Let sensitivity of the nondirectional microphone
be Mu. If the two microphones are connected in series so that their outputs
add, we obtain the combined sensitivity Mc, which is
The trick now is to adjust the sensitivities so that they are the same for

directly incident sound, that is, make M0 = Mu. (The method of adjustment
is unimportantâit could be done electrically.) For this condition, the
overall sensitivity is
In combination, the two microphones therefore have a directional response
proportional to (1 + cos 9). The polar plot of this function is called a
cordioid (Figure 6.13).
Directional Hearing Aid Microphones
The directional microphones used in hearing aids are, like the ribbon
microphone, sensitive to the sound pressure gradient. The aim is to enhance
the response to sound arriving from the front or side of the listener and
suppress the response to sound arriving from behind. A cardioid or similar
response is therefore appropriate. Directional systems may employ one or
more microphones and receive inputs from two or more locations in the
sound field. We will consider a simple first-order system in which the input
is taken from just two points. A typical directional microphone used in

170 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 6.13 Cardioid response.
hearing aids has two chambers, one on each side of the diaphragm. They
are connected by small tubes to openings in the case of the aid. The
openings, which we will call the front and rear ports, are approximately
aligned with the source of sound when it is directly in front of the listener
(azimuth 6 = 0).
Suppose that the distance between the ports is x. When sound comes from
directly in front of the microphone, the time difference between its arrival at
the front and rear ports is x/c. Call this time tx. It can be shown that the
root mean square value of the difference in sound pressure between the two
ports is proportional to eoÂ£x at frequencies for which x is small compared
with the wavelength; if the source is at an azimuth 6, the pressure difference
is proportional to cotxcos0. We therefore find that if a microphone has
separate ports supplying the front and rear of the diaphragm, its directional
response is bipolar, like that of the ribbon microphone described previously.
An ingenious feature of the hearing aid microphone is that it incorporates
an internal acoustic circuit that retards the phase of sounds entering the rear
chamber. The phase delay can be achieved by placing an acoustic resistance
in the acoustic path. The resistance, in conjunction with the compliance of
the air in the chamber and the compliance of the diaphragm, brings about

Measuring Sound 171
FIG. 6.14 Directional hearing aid microphone.
a phase change that is proportional to the frequency of the sound.5 The
effect is the same as would be obtained by increasing the time taken for
sound to travel to the rear surface of the diaphragm, and it is characterized
by an 'internal delay time', ti. Because of the internal delay, the microphone
will respond to sound pressure even if the distance between the ports is
reduced to zero, in which case the response would be nondirectional. A
cardioid response can therefore be obtained by separating the ports by a
distance that makes the external delay equal to the internal delay. This is
the equivalent to matching the sensitivities of the ribbon and dynamic
microphones as described earlier. Supercardioid and hypercardioid responses
are generated if the internal delay is respectively 0.58 and 0.33 times the
external delay. These responses resemble the cardioid except that the
sensitivity to sound from behind the microphone is increased.
It may be observed that a significant time delay occurs in the tubes that
connect the microphone to the external ports in the hearing aid. If the tubes
have the same length, then the delays cancel; if their lengths differ, then the
5The electrical equivalent is a series RC circuit where the input is applied across both elements
and the output is taken across the capacitor. Acoustic resistance and compliance and
equivalent circuits are explained in the next chapter. The complete equivalent circuit of the
microphone will also have several components including inductances. See, for example, E. V.
Carlson and M. Killion, J. Audio Eng. Soc. 22: 92-96, 1974.

172 Acoustics for Audiologists
internal delay is effectively increased or decreased according to which tube
is the longer.
In order to reach a better understanding of the way in which the
microphone favours sound from the front, consider the case in which the
internal and external delays are the same and the ports are aligned with the
path of the sound, as shown in Figure 6.14. The connecting tubes, which are
of equal length, each impose a delay tp. First, suppose that sound arrives
from the front. After reaching the front port, the sound takes time tp to reach
the front surface of the diaphragm and time tK + tp + ti to reach the rear
surface of the diaphragm. The time difference is therefore fx + ti, which is
equal to 2ti because the internal and external delays have been made the
same. Now suppose that the source is behind the microphone. After
reaching the rear port, the sound requires a time tp + ti to reach the rear of
the diaphragm and a time tx + tp to reach the front of it. The time difference
is ti â tx, which is zero. The sound pressures on each side of the diaphragm
are therefore equal and the forces on it cancel. In principle, then, the
microphone should be unresponsive to plane sound waves coming from
behind.
Although hearing aids with directional microphones may have well-
defined polar characteristics when tested in a free field, their performance
when worn is less predictable, partly because of diffraction by the head and
partly because sound from any one source is likely to be reflected from
numerous obstacles that are inevitably present in the neighbourhood of the
user. Nevertheless, directional microphones can give a worthwhile improve-
ment in the signal-to-noise ratio in the amplified sound when the noise is
fairly diffuse and the speaker is to the front of the listener.
Probe-Tube Microphones
Probe microphones allow sound pressures to be measured in confined
spaces that would be inaccessible to conventional microphones and in harsh
environments such as the interior of an automobile exhaust silencer. An
important feature of the probe microphone is that its presence has a
negligible influence on the sound field being measured. Applications include
in situ measurements on headphones and hearing protectors, and measure-
ments on machinery, musical instruments, loudspeakers, and telephones. An
important audiological application is the measurement of sound pressure
within the ear canal.
The probe microphone usually comprises a 'conventional' microphone
coupled acoustically to the measuring point by a fine-bore tube. The tube is
likely to produce considerable attenuation, so that the sound pressure at the

Measuring Sound 173
diaphragm is significantly less than at the open end of the tube. For
example, a 0.6-mm diameter tube, 100 mm in length, will reduce the pressure
by approximately 20 dB at 1 kHz. Attenuation generally increases with
increasing frequency, but resonances within the tube may give rise to
unwanted peaks and valleys in the frequency response. It is possible to
construct a microphone that is carefully matched to the acoustic properties
of the tube so that the frequency response is smooth and reasonably
constant up to a frequency of a few kilohertz,6 but for audiological work an
adequate probe microphone can be made by attaching a short length of soft
plastic tubing to a miniature hearing aid microphone. The response may be
sufficiently damped by virtue of the small diameter of the tube, but if
necessary, additional resistance can be added. One way is to insert a very
small piece of absorbent cotton. An example of a probe microphone is
shown in Figure 6.15.
Probe-tube microphones are used routinely to measure sound pressure in
the ear canal when hearing aids are fitted. In this work it is not usually
important for the microphone to have a perfectly uniform frequency
response because the test signals are usually pure tones rather than complex
signals. Correction for the frequency response is therefore straightforward.
Microphone Calibration
In this section we consider methods for calibrating microphones. Although
some of what is described will apply generally, our chief purpose is the
calibration of precision microphones used for measuring sound rather than
amplifying or recording it. It should be borne in mind that microphones are
evidently not used in isolation but as the first part of a sound-measuring
system or sound-level meter. Sound-level meters will be described later, but
it may be noted that calibration often involves the meter as well as the
microphone, the entire system being calibrated as a whole. Electronic
instruments are usually stable over long periods and their calibration is
generally straightforward. All that is needed on a day-to-day basis is
perhaps an adjustment of the overall gain to obtain a correct indication in
response to a standard reference voltage connected at the input in place of
the microphone. Microphones, on the other hand, are considered less
reliable (though in fact they are often surprisingly stable), and it is usual
practice to recalibrate them periodically and to check their performance (in
conjunction with the measuring equipment) each time they are used. A
further remark to be made here is that microphone calibration is a

Measuring Sound 175
technically challenging and interesting subject in its own right, and in this
section at least a passing reference will be made to the methods that may be
used even though they are not necessarily a part of everyday audiological
practice.
We start by reviewing some technical terms that relate to the performance
characteristics of a microphone and the type of measurement for which it is
designed. Microphones may be used either in a sound field occupying
generally some large volume with bounding surfaces that are usually
unspecified, or they may be used within a small closed volume whose
dimensions are precisely specified. A sound field is described as a free field
if its boundaries have a negligible influence in the region where measure-
ments are being made. In free-field applications, the sound will often be
propagated as plane waves. At the other extreme, sound is repeatedly
reflected from the bounding surfaces, with the result that the average sound
intensity is the same in all directions. A sound field where this condition
applies is called a diffuse field. In field measurements it is usual practice to
specify field characteristics (such as sound pressure level) as they exist in the
absence of the microphone and all amplifiers and equipment associated with
it and, naturally, the observer. There are many applications that require
sound to be measured in a closed volume. This is particularly true in
audiological work, where the performance of audiometric earphones and
hearing aids is usually assessed by measuring their output in specially
constructed acoustic couplers. The measurements in a closed volume are
usually referred to as pressure field measurements (or just pressure measure-
ments), and microphones designed for this purpose are called pressure
microphones, notwithstanding that most microphones are in fact sound
pressure transducers anyway.
As previously stated, the sensitivity of a microphone is the ratio of the
output voltage to the input sound pressure. If the measurements are made
in a closed volume, the sensitivity is called the pressure sensitivity of the
microphone, and the sound pressure at the diaphragm is the same as the
sound pressure elsewhere in the volume. If, however, measurements are
made in a free field, the sensitivity is described as the free-field sensitivity.
The diffuse-field 
sensitivity of the microphone is defined in a similar way.
The pressure p used to establish the sensitivity in a free or diffuse sound field
is the pressure in the undisturbed field and may differ significantly from the
pressure that is present at the diaphragm after the microphone is placed in
the field. This modification of the sound field is an example of diffraction. It
was stated in Chapter 3 that the disturbance of a sound field by an object
within it depends on the dimensions of the object in relation to the
wavelength of the sound: objects that are very small compared with the
wavelength have little influence on the sound field, objects comparable to

176 Acoustics for Audiologists
the wavelength have considerable influence, and very large objects reflect
sound like a mirror and cast acoustic shadows.
Direct calibration of the free-field or diffuse-field response of a micro-
phone is a difficult laboratory procedure requiring a special test environ-
ment. It is generally easier to determine the pressure response and, for sound
field measurements, to make corrections that allow for diffraction. Once a
microphone has been calibrated by the manufacturer or standardizing
laboratory, its pressure response can be used as the basis for calibrating the
entire measuring system. Users will usually calibrate their equipment to
establish its pressure response at one frequency only (typically 250 or 1000
Hz) and make corrections to determine the response at other frequencies
using data supplied by the manufacturer. If the microphone is to be used in
a sound field, further or alternative corrections are needed. Because the
sound field corrections make allowance for the diffraction produced by the
microphone, they depend on the direction of the incident sound. The
corrections are often supplied in an abbreviated form showing, for example,
the frequency response in a free field for one angle of incidence only. This
direction is the one that should normally be used. It is likely to be either 0Â°
(diaphragm facing the source) or 90Â° (diaphragm parallel to the direction of
propagation of sound), or unspecified if the field is diffuse. Note that there
is no standard guidance about this; it should not be assumed, as sometimes
happens, that a particular orientation is inherently the 'correct one'.
Examples of the free-field corrections for a condenser microphone are shown
in Figure 6.16. These corrections are to be added to the pressure response.
Some microphones intended for free-field measurement have pressure re-
sponses that are designed to cancel the free-field corrections and give a
nearly uniform frequency response over the working range.
It is necessary to understand that even the best microphones will have a
significantly nonuniform frequency response if the frequency range is suffi-
ciently extended. It is therefore necessary to restrict observations to those
frequencies and types of measurement for which corrections are known and
can be applied, or for which corrections can be ignored. This is one reason
for the use of the weighting networks and other filters to be described later.
Audiologists are fortunate in this regard because the upper frequency limit
needed for most audiological applications is about 8 kHz or less. Good-
quality microphones, if small enough (1/2-inch, for example) are likely to have
a practically uniform response up to this frequency.
Sound Calibrators
Sound calibrators enable a known sound pressure to be applied to a
microphone at one, or sometimes more, frequencies. As stated earlier, this

Measuring Sound 177
FIG. 6.16 
Examples of corrections that should be added to the pressure
response of a microphone (Bruel & Kjaer type 4145) to obtain its response in a
free field. See also Figure 6.5. (Reproduced with permission of Bruel & Kjaer

allows the pressure response of the measuring system to be determined at
the calibrating frequency, but it does not provide the overall frequency
response. Two kinds of calibrator are commonly used. The first of these
consists of a small loudspeaker that is acoustically coupled to the micro-
phone by a small cavity. In its simplest form the calibrator relies on the
calibration of the loudspeaker to provide a standard sound pressure. A
better performance can be achieved if the sound pressure in the cavity is
monitored by a reference microphone and thereby controlled so that it
maintains the same value regardless of the acoustic load (equivalent volume)
presented by the microphone under test. The merits of this type of calibrator
are its small size and portability, its robust construction, and its good
stability and accuracy. Simple calibrators (with no reference microphone)
are usually supplied with hearing aid test equipment so that it may be
calibrated before use.
The second type of calibrator is the pistonphone. This consists of a
cylindrical cavity into which the microphone is inserted. Two small pistons

178 Acoustics for Audiologists
project radially from a central structure within the cavity. They are driven
by a rotating cam attached to the shaft of an electric motor whose speed is
electronically controlled. The shape of the cam is such that the pistons move
sinusoidally, producing an oscillatory change in the volume of the cavity
and a corresponding sinusoidal variation in pressure. The pressure variation
(the sound pressure in the cavity) depends on the volume displacement of
the pistons relative to the volume of the cavity and on atmospheric pressure
(recall that the elastic modulus of a gas is yP for an adiabatic change).
Because these quantities are known, the sound pressure can be calculated.
The pistonphone therefore provides an absolute method of calibrating a
microphone at a single frequency. An accuracy of better than Â± 0.2 dB can
be achieved. In audiological work, pistonphones are often used to establish
the calibration of equipment which is then used to calibrate audiometers.
Electrostatic Actuator
The electrostatic actuator provides a laboratory method for calibrating
condenser microphones. It allows the shape of the frequency-response curve
to be measured but does not give an accurate value for the absolute
sensitivity. In other words, it establishes precisely how the response of the
microphone changes with frequency but does not provide at any frequency
an accurate calibration of the output voltage for a given sound pressure.
However, the sensitivity at one frequency (typically 250 Hz) can be meas-
ured using a pistonphone, so the combination of calibrations with an
actuator and a pistonphone will give the pressure sensitivity over the
working frequency range.
The principles underlying the electrostatic actuator are as follows. It is a
common observation that objects are drawn towards a charged surface by
electrostatic attraction. Similarly, the plates of a condenser are attracted to
each other by a force that is proportional to the square of the voltage
between them. The actuator consists of a perforated metal plate mounted
on insulating studs that stand on the tension ring on the rim of the
microphone (Figure 6.17). The actuator plate is thereby held parallel to the
diaphragm at some small distance from it (the gap is typically between 0.4
and 0.8 mm). The arrangement produces a parallel-plate condenser compris-
ing the actuator plate and the outer surface of the diaphragm while at the
same time the condenser of the microphone itself (formed by the inner
surface of the diaphragm and the microphone backplate) is unaffected. The
application of a sinusoidal alternating voltage between the actuator and the
diaphragm results in an alternating force on the diaphragm that is virtually
indistinguishable from the force that would be produced by a sound

pressure. The microphone can be operated in the normal way to record the
response to this force.
A minor complication is that the electrostatic force is attractive regardless
of the polarity of the applied voltage, whereas simulation of the sound
pressure requires an alternating force corresponding to acoustic compression
and rarefaction. The difficulty is overcome by adding a steady voltage to the
alternating voltage. This is the electrical equivalent of the way in which sound
pressure is an alternating pressure superimposed on the static atmospheric
pressure. Because the electrostatic force depends on the square of the applied
voltage, the alternating component of the force on the diaphragm is
theoretically not a perfect sinusoid, and it can be shown that there is a
component at twice the frequency of the applied voltage. But the steady-bias
voltage is typically 800 V, and the alternating voltage is typically 30 V rms. In
these circumstances the second harmonic is only 1.3%, that is, 38 dB, below
the level of the fundamental and is therefore negligible. Absolute calibration
is not possible with the electrostatic method because the gap between the
actuator plate and the diaphragm is not known precisely.
Insert-Voltage Method
The open-circuit sensitivity of a microphone is, for unit sound pressure, the
voltage that the microphone would produce if no electrical load were

180 Acoustics for Audiologists
present at its terminals. This is a fundamental characteristic of the micro-
phone that allows us to determine theoretically what output it will have
when it is connected to the preamplifier. We also have to know the
capacitance of the microphone and preamplifier and the stray capacitances
in the microphone cartridge, connectors, and cables. Let M be the sensitivity
of the microphone when it is connected to its preamplifier. This sensitivity
tells us what voltage the microphone will produce at the input to the
preamplifier when the diaphragm is exposed to unit sound pressure. Let M0
be the corresponding voltage at the terminals of the microphone when no
electrical load is present. Then
where, as before, Cm is the capacitance of the microphone and CL is the
input capacitance of the preamplifier plus any stray capacitance in the
connectors and cables. If p is the sound pressure at the diaphragm and g is
the voltage gain of the preamplifier, then the output voltage V of the
preamplifier is given by
The microphone capacitance is typically greater than 15 pF, whereas CL is
likely to be much smaller, perhaps only 0.3 pF. The ratio of M to M0 is
therefore close to unity, so that Cm and CL do not have to be known with
great accuracy and the calibration is determined principally by the value of
the open-circuit sensitivity, M0.
The open-circuit sensitivity can be found using the insert-voltage method
as follows. To start with, a known sound pressure p is applied to the
microphone, and the output of the preamplifier is noted. Call this voltage V.
It is equal to kV0, where k is a constant depending on the gain of the
preamplifier and on the capacitances just described, and where V0 is the
open-circuit voltage of the microphone. The sound source is now turned off
and a known voltage Vl is inserted in series with the microphone. This
operation is made possible by means of electrical connections provided on
a preamplifier specially designed for the insert-voltage measurements. The
inserted voltage V1 is adjusted so that the output of the preamplifier is again
equal to V and therefore to kV1. It follows that
An alternative to the insert-voltage method is the charge injection method.
As the name suggests, a known charge is inserted into the microphone

Measuring Sound 181
rather than a known voltage. An advantage of this method is that mechan-
ical or electrical faults affecting the capacitance of the microphone soon
become apparent.
Reciprocity Method
It is improbable that an audiologist will ever find it necessary to carry out a
reciprocity calibration of a microphone, but the method is of fundamental
importance as a primary means of calibration and the brief description given
here needs no further justification. The reciprocity theorem is one of the most
delightful creations of science. Its application is extremely wide, taking in
optics, acoustics, mechanics, heat transfer, electricity, and any part of physics
where a direct analogy may be made with force and velocity or displacement.
Before explaining the theorem, let us state the conditions in which it is valid.
It applies in systems that are passive and linear and it describes forces and
displacements or velocities (or their equivalents) that are harmonic. In other
words, the forces and the corresponding displacements are sinusoidal
functions of time. It is in principle limited to systems in which each of the
component vibrations can be described as a variation about an equilibrium
value, so, for example, it might not apply to the transmission of sound in a
flowing medium. To say that a system is passive means that it does not
contain any amplifiers or internal sources of energy; to say that it is linear
means that a sinusoidal force gives rise to a sinusoidal displacement at the
same frequency without overtones. Much has been written about the
reciprocity principle, and its general description would require mathematical
discourse well beyond the scope of this book. Instead, some simple examples
will be given to illustrate the underlying ideas. It will then be shown in
outline how these ideas can be put to use in calibrating acoustic transducers.
Suppose there is a room, divided partially by an internal wall (Figure
6.18). There are two tables, A and B, one on each side of the wall. On table
A there is a lamp, the only source of light in the room, and on table B there
is a light meter. It will be found that the reading on the meter will be the
same if the meter and the lamp are interchanged. This will be true regardless
of the presence of reflecting or absorbing obstacles in the room or the colour
of the paint on the walls (for example, one side of the partition could be
painted black and the other white). The same experiment can be made
acoustically, replacing the lamp by a simple sound source and the light
meter by a microphone. The only proviso is that in each case the source and
receiver must be nondirectional; that is, the lamp or sound source must
radiate uniformly in all directions and the light meter or microphone must
respond uniformly.

182 Acoustics for Audiologists
The acoustic experiment can be extended and expressed more formally as
follows. Suppose that a simple source of strength Q1 at a point A produces
a sound pressure p2 at a point B and that, alternatively, a simple source of
strength Q2 at B produces a sound pressure p1 at A. Then
where J is a constant whose value depends on the relative positions of A
and B and the acoustic environment in which they exist.
A simple demonstration of reciprocity in a mechanical system is provided
by the following example. Suppose a metal bar is held horizontally by
clamping it at one end while the other end remains free (Figure 6.19). If an
oscillatory force F is applied at a point A on the bar and the displacement

Measuring Sound 183
FIG. 6.19 The reciprocity principle applied to a mechanical system.
amplitude y is observed at a point B, then the same displacement will be
observed at A if the same force F is applied at B.
Let us now consider what are called reversible transducers. These are
transducers that can perform their conversion in either direction. A loud-
speaker, for example, produces sound when current is passed through its
speech coil. If the speaker is placed in a sound field, its diaphragm will
vibrate in response to the acoustic pressure and a voltage will be generated
across the ends of the coil. All microphones described in the foregoing
paragraphs are reversible, with the exception of the hearing aid microphones
that have built-in amplifiers. For the condenser microphone, we saw, when
describing the electrostatic actuator, that an alternating electric field be-
tween the plates of a condenser gives rise to an alternating force. The
condenser microphone therefore becomes a sound generator when an
alternating voltage is added to its polarizing voltage. Condenser micro-
phones are sometimes used in this way when the application requires a small
and accurately reproducible source.
Reversible transducers have an interesting property that allows the
reciprocity principle to be extended to include systems whose acoustic
elements include microphones and speakers. As an example, suppose that a
dynamic microphone is made into a sound source by passing a current
through it. The current causes a force to be generated within the micro-
phone which makes its diaphragm vibrate. Let the force be F when the
current in the microphone coil is /. Because the microphone is a linear

184 Acoustics for Audiologists
transducer, the force is directly proportional to the current and we can
write
where h is a constant called the electromechanical coupling coefficient. The
really interesting thing is that this constant can be defined in an entirely
different way and yet the same answer is obtained. Suppose the microphone
is disconnected from its electrical supply and that in response to sound
pressure or some other vibratory input to the diaphragm a sinusoidal
motion is produced with velocity u. In this condition let E be the open-
circuit voltage across the ends of the coil. Then
and h has the same value as before. It follows from this that
This relationship is true for the dynamic microphone and for the other
reversible transducers so far described. For such transducers the reciprocity
principle can be expressed in the following way. Suppose that the transducer
is operated as a sound receiver (as a microphone). Let pA be the sound
pressure at an arbitrary reference point A close to the transducer (Figure
6.20), and let E be the corresponding open-circuit voltage that appears at
the terminals. Now suppose that the transducer is operated as a source
supplied with a current I. At a point B whose distance from A is d, the sound
pressure due to the operation of the transducer is pB. The reciprocity
theorem (in its electroacoustic form) then states that
The first term is the 'microphone response' of the transducer, and the second
term is its 'speaker response'. The ratio of these quantities is the constant J,
called the reciprocity constant or reciprocity coefficient. If the transducer is
operating in a free field and if it is small enough to be in effect a source of
spherical waves when viewed from B, then J is given by

Measuring Sound 185
FIG. 6.20 Microphone response M, and speaker response S, of a reversible
transducer.
where / is the frequency of the sound and p0 is the density of air. Exactly
the same result applies in Equation 6.4.7
Equation 6.5 will look a little tidier if we write the microphone response
as M and the speaker response as S; that is,
Then
In other words, the reciprocity constant of a reversible transducer is the
ratio of its open-circuit voltage sensitivity to its sensitivity to current (its
speaker response) at a specified distance.
7The reader may confirm this by using Equation 4.1 to obtain an expression for Q1/p2. Note
that p2 should be treated as a pressure amplitude rather than an rms quantity, in keeping with
Q which is by definition a peak value. The root 2 in the denominator of Equation 4.1 is then
not required. The radial distance r is replaced by the distance d between points A and B.

186 Acoustics for Audiologists
The relationships just described are the basis of reciprocity methods for
calibrating microphones. Calibration can be done in various ways to give
the free-field or the pressure sensitivity. There are, to be sure, practical
difficulties and refinements to be considered according to the type of
calibration and the type of microphone being calibrated, but we shall
overlook these and present the method in its most basic form. We shall
suppose that the free-field response is required and we shall not insist that
the microphone being calibrated (the 'test' microphone) must itself be
reversible. In addition to the test microphone, we require a sound source
and a reversible transducer. The calibration is made in two steps as
described next and illustrated in Figure 6.21.
STEP 1
a. Place the reversible transducer in the sound field of the source and
measure its open-circuit voltage ER.
b. Replace the reversible transducer with the test microphone and
measure its open-circuit voltage E1.
Because the reversible transducer and the test microphone were each
exposed to the same sound field, the measured voltages are in the same ratio
as the corresponding microphone sensitivities, here denoted by MR and M,
respectively. Accordingly,

T is the microphone being calibrated.

Therefore
STEP 2. Place the test microphone at a distance d from the reversible
transducer. Pass a current IR through the latter and record the open-circuit
voltage E2 of the test microphone.
Let pR be the sound pressure at the diaphragm of the test microphone. If
5R is the speaker response of the reversible transducer, then, by definition,
But from the reciprocity theorem, MR/SR = J and therefore
But E2 = MpR and therefore
so that
Multiplying Equations 6.7 and 6.8 gives M2, so on taking the square root
and substituting for J from Equation 6.6, we arrive at the desired result,
namely,
The important thing to notice about this expression for the free-field
sensitivity of the test microphone is that it contains only terms that can
easily be measured. The difficult problem of measuring sound pressure
directly is avoided. This is a particular merit of the reciprocity method.
One further point concerning the reciprocity principle is that the directiv-
ity pattern of a transducer (the way its response varies with the direction of
the transmitted or received sound) is the same whether it is acting as a
source or a microphone. The directional properties of a condenser micro-
phone mounted in an infinite baffle would be the same as those of a similarly
mounted circular piston. If two omnidirectional microphones are separated
by a small distance and their outputs are connected so that one is subtracted
from the other, the directional response of the combination would be that
of the acoustic dipole described in Chapter 4.

188 Acoustics for Audiologists
Sound-Level Meters
A sound-level meter is an instrument for measuring sound pressure level. Its
development has a long history. At first, efforts were made to produce an
instrument that would give an objective indication directly related to the
'response of the human ear' or at least to the subjective sensation that we
call loudness. As we shall see, weighting circuits (filters) were incorporated
to shape the frequency response of the meter so that it matched the loudness
response of the ear to pure tones. The weighting functions were therefore the
inverse of the equal loudness curves. A major obstacle was that the shape
of these curves is not independent of sound level, so that different frequency
weightings had to be selected according to the overall sound pressure.
Moreover, it was found that loudness is not a simple function of the
frequency-weighted sound pressure but a quality that depends also on other
physical attributes, including particularly the distribution of sound energy
within the spectrum. While objective correlates of the subjective qualities of
sound do existâfor example, in loudness and annoyance ratings â they are
not usually derived from the result of a single measurement but are more
often obtained following calculations from a number of separate observa-
tions. Some weighting functions have survived, and nearly all modern
instruments can provide an A-weighted response, but their purpose is not
to give a direct indication of loudness.
There are various ways in which sound-level measurements can be made,
and there are many different sounds and many environmental and measure-
ment variables to be considered. Standardization is therefore essential if
observations from different origins are to be compared. The operating
characteristics of sound-level meters are the subject of international agree-
ment as specified in IEC 60651. The preamble to this standard contains the
following paragraph:
Owing to the complexity of operation of the human ear, it is not possible at
present to design an objective noise measuring apparatus to give results which
are absolutely comparable, for all types of noise, with those obtained by
subjective methods. However, it is considered essential to standardize an
apparatus by which sounds can be measured under closely defined conditions
so that results obtained by users of such apparatus are always reproducible
within stated tolerances.
In keeping with the standard, sound-level meters are classified according
to the application and measurement accuracy required:
Type 0 Laboratory reference standard
Type 1 Laboratory use or use in the field,8 where the acoustical envi-
ronment can be closely specified or controlled
8Not to be confused with a sound field. Here it means a work area that is not a laboratory.

Measuring Sound 189
Type 2 General field applications
Type 3 Intended primarily for noise surveys to determine whether an
established noise limit has been significantly violated
Type 2 meters are appropriate for general audiological applications such as
measuring or monitoring the sound fields for audiometry or hearing aid
tests; a type 1, or preferably type 0, meter is required for calibrating
audiometers.
All sound-level meters provide the user with an output indication in
decibels that is related in a standard way to the sound pressure at the
microphone. The following components are needed:
â¢ Microphone and preamplifier
â¢ Input amplifier (variable gain)
â¢ Weighting circuits and other filters
â¢ Output amplifier (variable gain)
â¢ Squaring and averaging circuit (and logarithmic converter)
â¢ Analogue or digital display
These components are shown schematically in Figure 6.22. In addition to
weighting filters, provision is often made for inserting external filters such
FIG. 6.22 Components of a sound-level meter.

190 Acoustics for Audiologists
as those needed for octave or third-octave analysis. Some sound-level meters
are equipped to measure peak sound levels and impulse-weighted levels.
These measurements will be described later. Many sound-level meters
provide an amplified (and filtered) version of the microphone output ('ac
output'), and some provide a rectified signal ('dc output') proportional to
the supply to the display unit. The ac output can be taken to a frequency
meter or an oscilloscope; the dc output can be used, for example, to supply
sound level recording equipment. The components just listed will be
described further in the following paragraphs.
Microphone and Preamplifier
The design of microphones has already been described. Laboratory sound-
level meters (types 0 and 1) are very likely to have condenser microphones,
so that a preamplifier is essential. This will normally be included within the
measuring instrument or supplied as an accessory if the microphone is to be
separated from it by a cable.
Sound-level meters are often portable instruments intended to be hand-
held or mounted on a tripod. The microphone is usually attached to the
front of the instrument case; the case is therefore an acoustically significant
object that modifies the sound field. An even greater modification is
inevitable if the observer is also present, as is necessary unless some
arrangement is made to read the meter remotely. The influence of the
instrument case on the indicated sound level is greatly reduced if the
microphone is mounted separately using a cable or if it is separated from
the instrument by an extension. In these circumstances a reasonably
uniform directional response can be obtained by fitting a special attach-
ment to the microphone known as a random incidence corrector. This cancels
the directional effects caused by diffraction. It is useful when measurements
are made in a diffuse field. The reflection of sound from the body of the
observer is greatest for frequencies around 400 Hz. If the observer stands
close to the microphone, the measured values are likely to be in error,
possibly by as much as 6 dB. The arrangement shown in Figure 6.23 is
recommended.
Input and Output Amplifiers
In simple instruments, only one main amplifier is used, but in better
instruments the amplifier is split into two independently controlled stages
on either side of the filter, as shown in Figure 6.22. An advantage of this

Measuring Sound 191
FIG. 6.23 Using a sound-level meter. (Redrawn from a sketch that appeared in
Jens Broch, Acoustic Noise Measurements. Bruel & Kjaer, Denmark, 1973.)
arrangement is that each amplifier can be operated at a gain that gives the
best performance (least internal noise) consistent with the input from the
microphone. It also gives the user some control over the signal level at the
filter, which may be important when an external filter is used, particularly if
it has components that generate significant electronic noise. The gain of each
amplifier can be changed in steps of exactly 10 (or sometimes 5) decibels.
The overall gain (in decibels) is the sum of the gains of each amplifier; this
has to be added to the indicated output. On some instruments the addition
may be done automatically.
Good-quality sound-level meters have indicators to warn the user of
overload in one or both amplifiers. This is important because an overload
may not be obvious from the value of the displayed output. It is good
practice to check, if possible, that the output remains unchanged when the
gain of one amplifier is increased by 10 dB while the gain of the other is
reduced by the same amount.

192 Acoustics for Audiologists
Weighting and Filters
The standard frequency weightings, designated as A, B, and C, are histori-
cally related to loudness functions that describe how the loudness of a pure
tone varies with sound pressure and frequency. Loudness is measured in
phons. The sound to be measured is compared with a 1-kHz tone, and the
intensity of the tone is adjusted until it is judged to have the same loudness.
The loudness of the measured sound in phons is then numerically equal to
the sound pressure level of the tone. A formal definition is given in the last
part of this chapter.
Curves showing the variation of sound pressure with frequency for
constant loudness are called loudness contours. The A, B, and C weightings
correspond approximately to the inverse of the 40-, 70-, and 100-phon
contours. For example, the 40-phon contour passes through a point corre-
sponding to a sound pressure of 51 dB SPL at 200 Hz. This means that
the sound pressure for a pure tone must be 11 dB greater at 200 Hz than at
1 kHz for the same loudness, and the A-weighting filter should reduce the
sensitivity of the sound-level meter by 11 dB at 200 Hz. The frequency
response of filters as specified in the IEC standard is, however, only an
approximate version of the inverse loudness contours. This is partly because
the filters are specified in a way that allows them to be realized using simple,
passive circuits whose branches contain only resistors and capacitors.
Another reason is that the equal loudness contours were further investigated
and redefined after the standard weighting characteristics had become
established.
The standard A, B, and C weighting functions are given in Table 6.1 and
shown graphically in Figure 6.24. The weightings require the use of three
filters: filter number 1 gives the C-weighted response, filter number 2 added
in series with filter number 1 gives the B-weighted response, and all three
filters together give the A-weighted response. Consistent with the definition
of the phon, all filters have unit gain (0 dB) at 1 kHz; that is, they do not
affect the response of the sound-level meter at this frequency. Sound
calibrators are sometimes operated at 1 kHz so that the calibration can be
verified with the filters in place. When the filters are used, the weighted
sound levels are expressed as dB(A), dB(B), or dB(C).
Given that sound-level meters are no longer intended to be instruments
for measuring loudness, what virtue is there in retaining the standard
weightings? So far as the B-weighting is concerned, the answer is very little.
This weighting is now virtually obsolete. The C-weighting is useful as a
means of limiting the operating bandwidth of a sound-level meter in a
well-defined way by providing a nearly uniform response between 31-5 and

Note: The table shows the weighted response of the
sound-level meter according to frequency and the se-
lected weighting characteristic. The tabulated values are
added to the unfiltered response. For example, if the
meter reads 60 dB without weighting at 400 Hz, its
A-weighted reading will be 60 - 4.8 = 55.2 dB(A).
The frequencies shown in the table are the nominal
frequencies recommended by the IEC. They are rounded
values of frequencies given by the formula f=1000x
10n/10, where n is a positive or negative integer.
The information given in the table is taken from Table
IV in IEC 60651 (1979).

8000 Hz. The attenuation for frequencies outside this range is given in
Table 6.1. If no filter is used, the bandwidth is of course limited, but it then
depends on the response of the microphone and the various amplifiers and
other electronic components. The nonfiltered (nonweighted) response of a
sound-level meter is often described as 'linear', and the measured sound level
is then given as 'dB LIN'. The linear' response is nonstandard and its
specification is left to the manufacturer or user.
The A-weighting remains the most important response-shaping function
because it gives a response that has some relevance to auditory physiology.
Its relation to loudness has already been described. It is also a clinically
useful approximation to the threshold of hearing. Below 5500 Hz the sound
pressure in dB(A) is within a few decibels of the threshold of hearing for
binaural listening in a free field (the minimum audible field;9 see Figure
6.25). For this reason it is often considered acceptable in 'sound field'
behavioural audiometry to treat threshold levels measured in dB(A) as
though they were true hearing levels. A further merit of the A-weighted
response is that it yields a result that is at least roughly proportional to the
sound energy delivered to the cochlea in a given time. Again, the upper
frequency limit is about 5500 Hz. In Figure 6.25 the crosses show estimated
values of the free-field sound pressures that are needed for a constant sound
pressure at the input to the cochlea. Measurement of exposure to noise and
estimates of the likely harm so caused often rely on A-weighted sound levels.
It is believed that damage to the cochlea caused by noise is related to the
9The minimum audible field (MAF) is defined as the threshold of audibility for pure tones heard
binaurally when the listener is facing the source of plane progressive waves.

1 kHz.)
total acoustic energy received by the cochlea. It is therefore logical that
A-weighting should be applied. Noise dosimetry will be considered later in
this chapter.
Squaring and Averaging
Sound level is, by definition, expressed in decibels and related directly to the
acoustic power emitted by the source or sources of the measured sound. The
quantities pn and p0 in Equation 6.2b are normally represented by their root
mean square values, so that when these averages are squared the result is a
quantity that is proportional to acoustic power. The electrical signal in the
sound-level meter is proportional to the instantaneous sound pressure at the
microphone; it is therefore necessary to square and average this signal. It is
not, however, necessary to follow this process by finding the square root of
the average, because when the result is expressed in decibels the number
representing the root is simply half that representing the square. The
difference is then merely a component of the scale factor in the final display.
Squaring can be accomplished as a mathematical operation using digital
electronics, but for simpler instruments various analogue methods are
available, each with its particular merits and shortcomings. The simplest
method is to rectify the signal and pass it through a circuit whose gain is
proportional to the instantaneous value of the input. Ideally this would

196 Acoustics for Audiologists
require the gain to be continuously variable, but in practice sufficient
accuracy can be obtained with a series of constant-gain sections, the gain
increasing in steps from one section to the next. Diodes are used to switch
the gain to the next as the signal changes.
The way in which the squared signal is averaged is of fundamental
importance because it determines the nature of the response of the sound-
level meter to the various sound pressure waveforms that may be present at
the input. In order that this important feature is understood, we should
remind ourselves of the way statisticians define the mean of a set of values.
Suppose we have N values y1, y2, y3, . . . , yN of some variable y. The mean
of y, here denoted as <y>, is given by
If y is a continuous variable, then the summation must be replaced by
integration, the result of which can be shown as the area under a curve, and
instead of dividing by N we divide by the range of the variable over which
the average is obtained. In the present context, we have a voltage v that
corresponds to the sound pressure at the microphone and we require the
average of the square of this voltage. The average is to be taken over time
T. The true average of v2 is then
where A is the area under the graph of v2 against time for the interval T
seconds (Figure 6.26). The output of the sound-level meter would ideally
represent an average calculated in this way. It would be a moving average
that included only the recent history of the signal from time T to the time
of observation. Such an average can indeed be obtained electronically,
especially if digital methods are used, but for most purposes a much simpler
procedure is available. This is sometimes called time-weighted exponential
averaging. Readers will be relieved to hear that this is not as fearsome as the
name suggests. It is important to know something about this type of
averaging because it is, at least historically, the basis of the way in which
averaging times are specified.
Exponential averaging is possibly the simplest type of averaging that can
be accomplished electronically. At its heart, the averager comprises just a
resistor and a capacitor connected in series. The signal to be averaged is
applied across both components, and the output â representing the aver-
ageâis the voltage that appears across the capacitor (Figure 6.27). Suppose
the capacitor is initially discharged and that a step voltage V0 is applied to
the input and maintained constant. As the capacitor acquires a charge, the

Definition of the average squared voltage during the averaging time T.
voltage on it rises, but as it does so the voltage across the resistor must
diminish because the sum of the voltage across the resistor and the capacitor
is constant. The charging current therefore decreases progressively, and the
rate at which the output voltage rises is reduced. If the output voltage V is
plotted against time, the result is an inverted exponential that approaches
the value of input voltage asymptotically (Figure 6.28). We can write this
formally as
FIG. 6.27 
Resistor-capacitor circuit for averaging.

198 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 6.28 The charge and discharge of a capacitor through a resistor.
The resistance R multiplied by the capacitance C is called the time constant
of the integrator. If the resistance is measured in ohms and the capacitance
in farads, the time constant will be in seconds. Now suppose that the
capacitor was fully charged to start with and that the input was made equal
to zero at time t = 0. As time passes the capacitor discharges through the
resistor and the output voltage falls. It does so exponentially:
We can regard the resistor-capacitor (RC) averager as a simple low-pass
filter. If its input is changing at a low frequency, the output on the capacitor
follows the input very closely because there is sufficient time for the charge
to adjust to the changing voltage. The opposite is true if the input varies at
a high frequency. There is little time during each cycle for the capacitor to
charge and discharge, and the voltage on it due to the high-frequency
components of the input is small. The frequency response for the RC circuit
is shown in Figure 6.29. It should be remembered that it is the squared value
of the acoustic signal that is passed to the averager. If the frequency is high
this value will fluctuate rapidly about its average (equal to half the square
of the amplitude if the signal is a sinusoid). It is the fluctuation that is

Measuring Sound 199
FIG. 6.29 The frequency response of the RC circuit shown in Figure 6.27.
suppressed by the RC filter. The condenser will charge or discharge until its
voltage is equal to the average.
To understand how the RC averager works as part of the sound-level
meter, we proceed as follows. We suppose that observations are made at
time t. In other words, t is an arbitrary time at which a reading of the output
of the sound-level meter is made. The level shown will depend on the history
of the input insofar as it has contributed to the charge remaining on the
capacitor. We shall use the symbol T to denote the time of events preceding
the moment of observation. The time that has passed between such events
and the time of observation is therefore t â T. Suppose that at time T the
input to the averager is a brief rectangular pulse having a voltage VT and
lasting for a time dx. It can easily be shown that the record of this pulse in
the output of the averager at time t is the voltage dV given by
When the sound-level meter is used, the voltage presented to the averager
is a continuous function of time, proportional to the square of sound
pressure at the microphone. This function can be treated mathematically as
though it consisted of a sequence of rectangular pulses of the type just
described, where the pulse height VT is equal to the voltage presented to the
averager during the brief interval from t to (T 4- <5t). The total voltage at the
output of the averager is then found by adding the contributions of all the

200 Acoustics for Audiologists
elementary pulses starting with those in the remote past (at T = â oo) and
ending just before the moment of observation (at T = t). This addition can
be carried out mathematically by integration. The result is
where V is the output of the averager and A' is the area under a graph of
J^exp[â(t â T)/.RC] plotted against T from times past to the time of
observation. We therefore see that the output of the averager is the sum of
the contributions from past events weighted by the exponential factor
according to the elapsed time t â i (see Figure 6.30).
Equations 6.9 and 6.10 allow us to compare the output of the RC
averager with the true moving average over time T up to the moment of
observation. We should remember that the voltage derived from the
microphone is squared prior to averaging, so that V is equivalent to <y2>.
It seems natural to choose values of R and C so that RC is equal to T. The
difference between the two averages then resides in the difference between A
and A'. One thing to note is that the ideal averager completely disregards
all events that occurred before time T, whereas the RC averager has an
output that, in principle, depends on the entire history of the signal. If
significant sounds were recently present, the user must allow the meter to
settle before making observations. This is not a problem if the time constant
is short, but it can be troublesome if it is equal to several seconds. Another
thing to note is that if the signal is unchanging (if it is a constant-amplitude
pure tone, for example) the RC average is identical with the true moving
average. The RC averager therefore behaves almost as an ideal averager
provided that the signal amplitude remains constant for a time that is at
least several times longer than the time constant. It is not, however, possible
to make general statements about the average that will be obtained for
varying signals except to say that because the properties of the RC averager
are simple and clearly specified, the result can often be interpreted if enough
is known about the signal waveform. For example, the response to tone
bursts whose duration is greater or less than the integration time can be
anticipated and used to test the performance of the averager.
This account is by no means the whole story. The best modern instru-
ments use digital processing to calculate the root mean square of the signal.
Simpler instruments rely on analogue circuits, but even here it is possible to
improve on the simple squaring and RC averaging just described. In one
very successful technique, part of the output of the averager is used as a
feedback to modify the signal-squaring operation. The overall result is
shown to be an output that is directly proportional to the root mean square
of the original signal.

Measuring Sound 201
FIG. 6.30 Averaging a voltage proportional to the square of the sound pressure.
The simplest method, which uses an RC circuit with a time constant equal to the
required averaging time of the meter, is sometimes called exponential time-
weighted averaging. In this illustration the input waveform (after squaring) is
treated as if it were a series of rectangular pulses. The output is the sum of the
responses from each pulse. The upper diagram shows the voltage rise during an
elementary pulse of height Vr and duration di, and the subsequent decay of this
voltage during time t - T. The lower diagram shows a portion of the squared
waveform divided into a series of pulses, each of width <3i.
The international standard10 specifies two averaging times, which it
designates as F (fast) and S (slow). They are 125 ms and 1000 ms,
respectively. The use of exponential averaging is not an explicit requirement
of the standard, but its authors clearly had this in mind. They provide tests
10At the time of printing (January 2002), IEC 60651 (1979) was being revised. The new version
is very likely to retain the current specifications for the averaging time of the detector and
its response to tone bursts.

202 Acoustics for Audiologists
using tone bursts that should be used to verify the response characteristics.
These tests are based on the assumption that the squared signal is passed
to an RC averager having a time constant equal to the specified S or F
averaging time.
Output and Display
The sound-level meter must provide an indication in decibels. If its output
is to be displayed digitally, or if it is to be displayed in analogue form using
a linear scale, then it becomes necessary to find the logarithm of the signal
leaving the averager. Logarithmic conversion is straightforward if done
digitally. It may be more difficult to achieve in analogue circuits, but, as with
so many electronic requirements, the designer has integrated circuits that
perform such tasks to a high standard.
Many of the simpler sound-level meters (types 2 and 3) use a moving-coil
meter as the indicator. The conversion of the output voltage, proportional
to the mean square of the sound pressure, to a number of decibels can be
done simply by giving the indicator a nonlinear scale graduated in decibels.
The disadvantages to this are that the meter may be difficult to read
accurately unless the selected amplification brings the indication to the
central region of the scale, and that there is no dc output for connection to
other equipment.
Other Features
As previously mentioned, indicators are often fitted to alert the user to
amplifier overload that might otherwise go unnoticed.
Equipment that is intended for use in the field rather than the laboratory
has to be battery powered. It should be provided with a means of checking
that the battery voltage is adequate. It is good practice to check the battery
condition (and sound-level calibration) before and after measurement.
Good-quality instruments usually have an internal reference oscillator
running, probably, at 1 kHz. This provides a standard signal that can be
applied to the input amplifier for self-testing. Connections should also be
available for replacing the microphone output with an electrical signal from
an external source. This allows the sound-level meter to be tested indepen-
dently of its microphone. It also turns it into a very useful rms-indicating
voltmeter.
Sound-level meters complying with the IEC standard must provide at
least one of the specified A, B, or C weightings. Additional frequency

Measuring Sound 203
responses that might be made available include D-weighting (for aircraft
noise measurements) and the so-called linear response that was mentioned
previously.
In addition to the indicator characteristics previously described, good
sound-level meters often have circuitry for measuring the peak or the
impulse-weighted response to transient signals. We will consider these in
more detail presently. The option of a long averaging time (perhaps 10 or
20 seconds) is also helpful. It can be used to obtain a statistically represen-
tative sample of a fluctuating signal and is sometimes useful when correcting
the measurement of weak signals for the influence of background noise. This
correction will be described later.
Measuring Impulsive Sounds and Other Transient Signals
Transients such as acoustic clicks and tone bursts are often used as stimuli
for auditory evoked potentials. Transient signals are also audiologically
important when they are a potential source of harm. Impulse noise from
gunfire is an example. A complete characterization of such signals requires
a knowledge of the waveform, but usually one has to be content with a far
simpler description. The following sections describe terms that are related
to measurements that are often made.
Peak Sound Pressure Level
This is a level derived from the greatest sound pressure during the existence
of the signal. Some sound-level meters have a circuit that captures the peak
pressure and holds the peak level in the display until it is reset or
overwritten by a greater value. The sign of the pressure is disregarded: it
may be positive (compression) or negative (rarefaction). If pm is the
maximum pressure so defined, then the peak sound pressure level is given by
20 Iog(pm/p0) dB SPL (peak)
where unless otherwise specified, the reference sound pressure p0 is equal to
20 uPa. According to IEC 60050, the standard frequency weightings may
apply to measured values of the peak level (in other words, the signal is
frequency weighted before it arrives at the peak detector); if no weighting is
specified, then A-weighting should be assumed. But one cannot rely on a
universal adherence to this convention. When results are reported it is good
practice to state explicitly how the measurements were made.

204 Acoustics for Audiologists
Peak-to-Peak Equivalent Sound Pressure Level
This measure is intended for use in audiometry, particularly in relation to
evoked potentials. The following definition is based on that given in IEC
60645:
Peak-to-peak equivalent sound pressure level The numerical value of the
sound pressure level due to a long-duration sinusoidal signal which, when fed
to the same transducer under the same conditions, produces the same
peak-to-peak sound pressure as the short-duration signal. For clicks the
long-duration signal should have a frequency of 1 kHz; for tone bursts it
should have a frequency equal to the fundamental frequency of the tone.
The definition can be extended to include vibratory stimuli (measured as the
force output of a bone vibrator). Frequency weighting is not implied. The
name is often shortened to peak equivalent sound pressure level and written
as 'dB peSPL'.
In this definition the expression peak-to-peak sound pressure means the
maximum pressure range that encompasses the transient signal. 'Peak-to-
valley' would be a more accurate (if unconventional) description. It is
important to understand that the peak equivalent level refers a peak-to-peak
range in the transient to the equivalent range in a sinusoid. The peak-to-
peak range in a sinusoid is twice its amplitude and therefore 2/2 times its
rms value. If we remember that 20 log/2 = 3 and 20 log 2 = 6, we can see
that the peak sound pressure level in a transient lies between 3 and 9 dB
above the peak equivalent level, depending on whether the transient is
symmetrical about the baseline or whether it is entirely on one side of it.
This is illustrated in Figure 6.31.
Sound-level meters do not show peak equivalent pressure levels directly,
but if the ac output is taken to an oscilloscope, comparison can be made
between the pressure waveform of the transient and the sinusoidal waveform
generated by the long-duration tone. The peak-to-peak range in the oscillo-
scope display of the transient is noted. The transducer is then connected to
a sinusoidal supply, which is adjusted until the same peak-to-peak range is
displayed. The root mean square sound pressure of the tone as indicated by
the sound-level meter is then numerically equal to the peak equivalent
pressure of the transient. For further discussion, see Chapter 8.
Impulse Response
Some sound-level meters provide detectors that offer an impulse or 'I-
characteristic'. This follows squaring and RC averaging similar to that used
for the S and F responses, but the time constant is much smaller (35 ms).
The maximum output of the averager is acquired by a peak detector. The

rise and fall times of the detector are designed to be unequal, so that its
output follows closely that of the averager during the time that the averaged
sound pressure is rising, but when the average is diminishing, the output
falls slowly (2-9 dB/s) to give the user time to read the maximum value. It
can be seen that the impulse response differs from the peak response
described earlier because the maximum being measured corresponds to the
greatest averaged sound pressure rather than the greatest instantaneous
pressure. The averaging time (35 ms) is long compared with the duration of
many impulsive sounds; for this reason, the impulse response increases with
the duration of the impulse and with its acoustic energy. This may be an
advantage in circumstances where energy has some significance. We there-

206 Acoustics for Audiologists
fore find that the impulse characteristic is used for noise assessment. It has
also been used to express the level of single test items in speech audiometry.
Simple Frequency Analysis
It often happens that we want to know how the acoustic power in a sound
field depends on frequency. Audiological applications include analysis of the
masking noise produced by an audiometer and the measurement of back-
ground noise in test rooms used for audiometry. Another application is in
tests that evaluate the listener's ability to hear speech against competing
noise. Such tests are often used to assess the performance of hearing aids.
The spectrum of the noise is a critical factor.
A full-spectrum analysis requires special and usually expensive equipment
capable of narrow-band filtering or real time Fourier analysis. A relatively
simple alternative is to divide the frequency scale into a series of bands using
octave or third-octave filters, and to measure the sound pressure level in
each band. The filters should ideally have a uniform response in their pass
bands and an infinitely steep cut-off at the boundaries, and their bandwidths
should form a contiguous series of frequency bands throughout the fre-
quency range to be explored. In practice this ideal can be approached quite
closely, and good-quality filter sets are usually available from manufacturers
of sound-measuring equipment. Such filters are usually inserted between the
input and output amplifiers of the sound-level meter, where they either
replace or add to the standard frequency weightings. An obvious acoustical
requirement is that the spectrum of the sound being investigated has to be
reasonably constant during the time needed to complete the measurements.
Combining Measured Sound Levels
There are occasions when it is necessary to combineâto add or subtractâ
quantities related to acoustic power, given measured values expressed in
decibels. To put it loosely, we want to 'add or subtract decibels'. We might,
for example, have measured the sound pressure levels due to source A acting
alone and source B acting alone and would like to know the level to be
obtained if both sources are on at the same time. Again, we might, having
obtained an octave band analysis of a sound, want to confirm that total
sound level measured without filtering is equivalent to the sum of the
measurements made with the octave band filters. As a further example, we
might want to correct a measured sound level for the background noise that
was present at the time of measurement.

Measuring Sound 207
The combination of sound levels requires three steps:
1. Convert the number of decibels in each measurement to a number
proportional to the absolute power of the source.
2. Add (or subtract) the absolute values.
3. Convert the sum (or difference) of the absolute values to decibels.
Step 2 needs some justification, and there are times when it is not valid.
We shall return to this later and deal first with the addition of sound power
from sources that independently produce sound levels LA and LB. Let the
corresponding sound pressures be pA and pB and let the reference pressure
(20 uPa) be p0. If both sources are on at the same time, the sound pressure
is pAB, for which the sound level is LAB. The algebra that follows may seem
rather messy because of the subscripts and exponents that are needed, but
the end result is a very simple formula that is easily handled using a pocket
calculator. We shall find that the reference pressure does not feature in the
calculation, but it is included here to make the reasoning easier to under-
stand.
By definition,
Therefore,
We shall assume that addition is on an energy basis; that is, the squares of
the sound pressures may be added:
Therefore,
Therefore,
so that

208 Acoustics for Audiologists
The sound level LAB is easily found using a pocket calculator because
terms of the form 10* can be evaluated using the inverse log function.
Equation 6.12 can be extended to include the addition (or subtraction) of as
many terms as are required. The following numerical example shows how
this is done. Suppose that sources A, B, and C when acting alone produce
the sound pressure levels 65, 70, and 72 dB SPL, respectively. What level
should we expect when all sources are on at the same time? Substituting in
Equation 6.12 gives
It will be noticed that each of the terms in the brackets is a large number.
If the arithmetic is done with a calculator, these numbers can be added in
memory before taking the logarithm. If it is done by hand, it is convenient
to first take out a suitable factor, which in this example would be 106. Then
Correction for Background Noise
An important case involving the subtraction of sound energies is the
correction of measurements for the presence of background noise. The noise
may be present in the test environment or may be inherent within the
measuring equipment. Two sound-level measurements are needed: one with
the signal turned off and the other with the signal present. If the object of
measurement (the signal) is the environmental sound itself, then the no-
signal condition (with only the inherent noise in the equipment) can be
obtained by covering the microphone with a noise-excluding cap or placing
it in a relatively sound-free enclosure. Let the measured sound levels be LSN
when both signal and noise are present and LN when only the noise is
present. Then the corrected sound pressure level of the signal is Ls, where,
from Equation 6.12,

Measuring Sound 209
The correction given by Equation 6.13 can be evaluated using the
arithmetic just described, but an alternative method is often suggested. This
involves finding the value of a correction Lc that must be subtracted from
LSN to obtain the true level of the signal Ls. If D decibels is equal to the
difference LSN â LN, then it is easily shown that the correction is given by
This leads to a positive value of Lc because the quantity in the brackets (the
argument of the logarithm) is less than 1. The correction could be found by
direct substitution into Equation 6.14, but the arithmetic is not simplified.
The real value of this expression is that it can be represented graphically,
allowing the correction term to be found without calculation (Figure 6.32).
The final arithmetic is then merely the subtraction of one number from
another. For example, suppose readings of 33 dB and 31 dB are obtained
for the noise-plus-signal and noise-only conditions, respectively. The differ-
ence is 2 dB, and we see from the graph that the correction term is 4-3 dB.
The true level of the signal is therefore 33 â 4-3 = 28-7 dB.
It can be seen that when measurements are made in a noisy background,
the estimates of the signal level become increasingly inaccurate as D
becomes smaller; that is, a small variation or error in the measurement of D
leads to a large variation in the correction factor. Ever more precise

herent noise in the measuring equipment. D = LSN â LN dB, the difference
between readings of (signal + noise) and noise alone. Subtract the correction Lc
from LSN to find Ls.

210 Acoustics for Audiologists
measurements of LSN and LN are called for. If the noise and the signal are
stable, the precision can be greatly improved by increasing the averaging
time. The 'S' response or one with a longer time constant should be selected
if it is available.
Combining Sound Levels: Statistical Independence
It was stated earlier that some justification is required for the assumption
that sound levels can be combined by adding the squares of the absolute
sound pressures (as in Equation 6.11, for example). The assumption is
generally valid only if the vibrations to be combined are statistically
independent. To see why this is necessary, suppose that a particular
waveform is sampled to provide a set of values that taken in sequence
represent the wave but are otherwise just a set of numbers of the sort that
could be obtained when any physical quantity is measured repeatedly. The
sampling can be imagined as a 'thought experiment', but it is a reality if the
measuring equipment uses digital processing. The average of the sample is
a number representing the average sound pressure during the sampling
period. Now, sound pressure is a quantity that varies above and below
atmospheric pressure, and, if atmospheric pressure, is disregarded, the mean
of the sample must approach zero as the sample size is increased. The
variance in the sample is defined as the mean square deviation from the
sample mean, in this case the mean square deviation from zero. It is the
mean square sound pressure during the sampling period. Imagine now that
there are two variables, x and y, drawn from any two populations that may
or may not have the same characteristics. Suppose that xi and yt are the
values of randomly selected members from each of these populations.
Adding xt and yt gives a new variable, zi = xi + yt. Statistical theory tells us
that if the samples of x and y are independent (meaning that the value of
one is not influenced by the value of the other), then the variance of z is
equal to the variance of x plus the variance of y;.
The implication for acoustics is that sound levels can be combined by
adding the mean squares of the corresponding sound pressures, providing
that the sources of the sounds are independent. In many applications such
independence can be virtually guaranteed. For example, the environmental
noise in an audiometric test room is unrelated to the instrument noise within
the sound-level meter. There are, however, occasions when independence is
less certain. To give an instance of this, suppose we are attempting to
measure the pure tone output of an audiometer at some level close to
threshold. We find that the measured level falls by only a few dB when the
tone switch is turned off, and we are tempted to make a correction for what

Measuring Sound 211
appears to be background noise. But we might find on careful investigation
that the noise observed with the tone turned off was just an attenuated
version of the signal that had broken through the switching circuit. A
correction using the methods just described would be invalid.
Measuring Subjective Qualities
of Sound
We have scarcely mentioned the subjective attributes of sound, the sensa-
tions that it evokes, except in the reference to loudness earlier in this
chapter. Anyone who is not a mystic would have to accept that all auditory
sensations other than tinnitus are ultimately determined by the physical
signal. Even the emotional quality that we call music has to be mediated by
the physical events that precede the act of hearing. Yet despite the diversity
of acoustic sensations, only two, pitch and loudness, have a simple relation-
ship to the physical world. All others have a complicated and often barely
understood connection with intensity and waveform, with the sound spec-
trum, and with the spatial and temporal distribution of physical occurren-
ces. We still use the word volume to mean something akin to loudness, but
not quite the same as loudness, yet how is such a sensation related to the
concept of three-dimensional space or to the distribution of sound within
such a space?
Loudness is the sensory concomitant of acoustic intensity, and pitch is
likewise related to frequency, though neither is quite independent of the
other. The pitch of a note depends on its loudness, and loudness is obviously
related to frequency, if not to pitch itself. Because both intensity and
frequency are measurable physical quantities, we can express the corre-
sponding sensations in terms of their physical counterparts.
Loudness
We described earlier how the standard frequency weightings were originally
based on loudness contours expressing loudness measured in phons. The
official definition of this unit is as follows:
Loudness levelâof a sound, in phons, numerically equal to the median sound
pressure level in decibels, re 20 //Pa of a free progressive wave having a
frequency of 1000 Hz presented to listeners having normal hearing facing the
source that in a specified number of trials is judged equally as loud as the
unknown sound (IEC 60050).

212 Acoustics for Audiologists
Loudness can also be expressed in sones. The sone scale is designed to
give numbers that are approximately proportional to loudness. It is defined
in terms of loudness level. If P is the number of phons and S is the number
of sones, then
or
We see from these formulae that a loudness level of 40 phons corresponds
to a loudness of 1 sone; doubling the loudness in sones increases its level by
10 phons. Methods are available for calculating loudness level from
measurements of the sound spectrum in third-octave bands11. Methods
similar to those for expressing loudness have been devised for expressing
'noisiness' in terms of the sound pressure level of a single band of noise or
the pressure levels in series of third-octave bands.
Pitch
The pitch of a tone is almost entirely dependent on its frequency, but it is
influenced to a small degree by intensity. The pitch of a complex tone
depends on its spectral content or on the periodicity of the complex.12 The
unit of pitch is the mel, which is defined as follows:
Mel 
Unit of pitch. A pure tone frontally presented, having a frequency of
1000 Hz and a sound pressure level of 40 dB, causes a pitch of 1000 mels. The
pitch of a sound that is judged by the listener to be n times that of a 1000 mels
tone is n thousand mels (IEC 60050).
Although judgements of pitch intervals (musical intervals) can be made
with great precision, judgements of what might be called 'pitch extent' are
considerably more variable, making the mel scale difficult to realize. In
general it can be said that the pitch of a sound rises continuously with
increasing frequency, but the relationship is nonlinear. Doubling the fre-
quency of a sound produces a smaller relative change in pitch. For pure
tones, the pitch in mels is said to be directly related to the position of

greatest vibration on the basilar membrane such that equal changes of pitch
correspond to equal distances along the membrane.
Measuring Noise Exposure
Exposure to high sound levels for long periods damages the ear perma-
nently. Although the harmful effects of noise, particularly in military and
industrial contexts, have been known for a long time, it is only in the last
50 years that a quantitative relationship between noise exposure and hearing
loss has been established. As might be expected, the relationship is highly
variable from one individual to another, but statistical predictions of the
hearing loss within a noise-exposed population are possible. There therefore
exists a technical and statistical basis for setting limits on the allowable
exposure to noise in the workplace.
If the noise is more or less continuous, as distinct from impulsive, its
potential to harm the ear is related to what is called the sound exposure. In
the restricted technical sense, this term describes an energy-like quantity
based on the average squared sound pressure multiplied by the duration of
exposure to noise. If the noise is impulsive, the hazard is more difficult to
assess. Relevant characteristics include the peak level in the impulse, the
energy, and the time during which a specified sound pressure is exceeded.
No single descriptor appears to be capable of defining the likely conse-
quences of exposure.
The protection of workers from the effects of noise has become an
important element of occupational medicine and health and safety regula-
tion. It has also led to considerable expansion in the manufacture of acoustic
instruments, particularly those capable of measuring environmental noise
and personal noise exposure (noise dosimetry). In parallel with this, there
have been advances in methods for reducing noise at sources and in the
working environment. Even when noise is not directly harmful to the ear, it
can be a highly significant source of annoyance with psychological and
social consequences that are far from trivial. There is now a large industry
concerned with all aspects of noise control, noise measurement, and noise
legislation.
Occupational health measures, designed to protect noise-exposed individ-
uals, are almost universally based on the so-called equal energy principle.
According to this, equal A-weighted sound exposures are equally noxious
regardless of the particular exposure history, at least in the short term. A
high-level sound present for a short time has the same potential to harm the
ear as less intense sound present for a longer time, provided that the product
of the squared sound pressure and the exposure time is the same in each

214 Acoustics for Audiologists
case. It is, of course, highly unlikely that anyone will be exposed to noise at
a constant level; it is therefore necessary to take into account the variation
that occurs during the period for which the exposure is to be reckoned. To
do this, it is necessary to divide the exposure time into indefinitely short
intervals and add the sound exposures in each intervalâan example of a
process called integration. The sound exposure accumulated over a time T
is therefore the area under a graph showing the square of the sound pressure
plotted against time. As an example, Figure 6.33a shows a signal propor-
tional to the square of the sound pressure in a sample of random noise. The
shaded area is equal to the sound exposure E over the interval T. It has units
of Pa2s. In a practical instrument for measuring sound exposure (an
integrating sound-level meter), it is likely that exposure would be derived
from an average of the squared signal. A suitable method of averaging
long-duration signals is to use the standard 'slow' response RC averaging
described earlier. This provides a running average with a time constant of 1
second. When T is much greater than 1 second, the area under the averaged
signal (Figure 6.33b) is almost the same as that under the raw signal.
It is usual to express sound exposure in decibels. The reference exposure
E0 is (20 uPa)2 x 1 s = 4 x 10-10 Pa2 s, and the sound exposure level L is
then given by
FIG. 6.33 
Measuring sound exposure, (a) Raw signal proportional to the square
of the sound pressure, (b) The waveform shown in the top part of the figure after
RC averaging. The shaded areas, which are approximately the same in each
case, are equal to the sound exposure E over the interval T.

Measuring Sound 215
The sound exposure level is a useful description of 'noise dose' for both
long-duration exposures and single events. It has even been used to
characterize impulsive sounds, notwithstanding that if the impulse is suffi-
ciently brief and sufficiently intense, the equal energy principle is likely to
be invalid. A-weighting is usually implied, but it can, if necessary, be made
explicit by adding the subscript 'A', as in LA. Other subscripts may be
used to denote alternative frequency weightings or to distinguish sound
exposure level from other decibel levels denoted by the same symbol.
Unfortunately, the symbols used to describe exposure to noise are frequently
decorated with numerous and complicated subscripts in an attempt to avoid
duplication. Provided that the meaning is clearly stated according to
context, it would be better to accept duplication as a reasonable concession
to simplicity.
As an alternative to the reference exposure defined earlier, exposures are
often expressed in terms of the noise energy present over an 8-hour working
day or over a 24-hour period of which 8 hours are notionally taken to be
potentially noisy. The duration for calculating E0 is then the number of
seconds in 8 hours, so that
With this reference, the exposure level is called the noise exposure level. For
the same sound and duration, it is numerically 44.6 dB less than the sound
exposure level. A-weighting is used. When the noise exposure level is used as
a measure of an individual's exposure during a 24-hour period, the term
daily personal noise exposure level is used. In principle, the noise is added
over the 24 hours, but the 8-hour reference is applied. Symbols are Lp,d or
LEX,8h-
It is often convenient to express noise exposure in terms of the sound
pressure in a steady sound that would be associated with the same acoustic
energy as that present in an actual exposure, in other words, an equivalent
steady sound. If the shaded area in Figure 6.33 is divided by the dura-
tion T, the result is the average squared sound pressure in the interval. The
average is equal to the squared sound pressure of the equivalent steady
sound:
The interval is usually taken to be 8 hours; again, A-weighting is
implied.
To give some idea of the significance of these measures, it may be said
that a daily exposure of less than 80 dB is unlikely to be harmful. Exposures

216 Acoustics for Audiologists
exceeding 85 dB, averaged over 8 hours, may be damaging; where they occur
in the workplace, the employer may be required to take some action. In the
United Kingdom, a personal 8-hour exposure of 85 dB is said to define 'the
first action level', obliging the employer to assess the environmental noise,
to identify the exposed personnel, and to advise them of the potential
hazard.13 Hearing protectors must be available on request. A 'second action
level' is identified with an 8-hour exposure of 90 dB. When this is exceeded
the employer must provide hearing protection. If the noise is impulsive, its
harmful effects may not be adequately represented by an average exposure.
In this case a 'peak action level' is defined for impulses in which the
maximum sound pressure is 200 Pa. This has the same statutory significance
as the 'second action level'.
The accumulated noise exposure during a lengthy period of work in a
noisy occupation is sometimes expressed as a noise immission level (NIL).
An important study undertaken in the United Kingdom in the 1960s
demonstrated a statistical relationship between this measure of noise and
the hearing loss acquired by employees.14 The definition of noise immission
level is similar to that of the noise exposure level except that the reference
period is 1 year. It is assumed that the year comprises 1740 working hours
and that noise exposure outside the workplace is negligible. The correspond-
ing reference level is then 2.51 x 10-3 Pa2s. Noise immission levels are
usually calculated on the basis that the average A-weighted sound pressure
level LA in the workplace is constant. Accordingly, the immission level after
employment for N years is given by
Statistical distributions of hearing loss in an exposed population have been
tabulated for values of EA between 80 and 130 decibels.15

Office Ltd, London, 1989.
14Immission is not to be found in English-language dictionaries. The term was invented to
denote this particular energy-related quantity. It is usually represented by the symbol EA,
where the subscript shows that A-weighting is required. The study referred to was undertaken
by the Medical Research Council in collaboration with the National Physical Laboratory.
From its findings, Douglas Robinson produced a simple mathematical model that showed
how the noise immission level could be used to predict the distribution of noise-induced
hearing loss in the noise-exposed population. See W. Burns and D. W. Robinson. Hearing
and Noise in Industry. HMSO, London, 1970; W. Burns. Noise and Man, 2nd ed. John

Questions and Exercises
Practical exercises are marked with an asterisk.
6.1 
Explain the differences between sound pressure level, hearing level, and
sensation level.
6.2 
What is meant by the sensitivity of a microphone? At 1 kHz, a
microphone produces an output of 0.20 mV for a sound pressure of
750 mPa, while at 2 kHz its output is 0.40 mV for a sound pressure
of 1300 mPa. Calculate the sensitivities at these frequencies and
express in decibels the frequency response at 2 kHz relative to the
frequency response at 1 kHz.
6.3 
Describe briefly the construction of a condenser microphone and the
way in which the microphone works. When a positive sound pressure
is applied to the microphone does its capacitance increase or de-
crease? Suppose that the polarizing voltage makes the backplate
electrically positive relative to the diaphragm. In response to positive
sound pressure, is the output voltage of the microphone then positive
or negative? Justify your answers.
6.4 
Why is it necessary to vent the capsule of a condenser microphone?
What effect does this have on its frequency response?
6.5 
The sensitivity of a condenser microphone can be increased by
reducing the tension in the diaphragm. What are the disadvantages
of doing this?
6.6 
Why does a condenser microphone usually require a preamplifier?
6.7 
What is electret? Why is the electret microphone particularly well
suited to hearing aid applications?
6.8 
What is piezoelectricity? Give an example of a commonplace
nonacoustic application of the piezoelectric effect in the home.
6.9 
What are the relative merits of crystal and ceramic microphones?
6.10 What is meant by a cardioid response? If a microphone has this
response and its sensitivity to directly incident sound (0 = 0) is
0.017 V/Pa, what is its sensitivity for sound incident (a) from one side
(0 = 90Â°) and (b) obliquely from behind (8 = 130Â°)? Express the
results in absolute terms and in decibels relative to the sensitivity for
frontally incident sound.

218 Acoustics for Audiologists
6.11 Distinguish between the free-field sensitivity and the pressure sensitiv-
ity of a microphone. Why are they different?
6.12 What is a pistonphone? Why is this instrument suitable only for
measurements at low frequencies? What are its particular merits?
6.13 Explain the principle of the electrostatic actuator. If a microphone is
calibrated with an electrostatic actuator, what additional information
is needed if it is to be used for (a) precision measurement of sound
pressure in a closed cavity or (b) free-field measurements?
6.14 A microphone is calibrated with a pistonphone at 250 Hz. Its pressure
response measured with an electrostatic actuator shows that its
sensitivity is 1.7 dB greater at 6 kHz than it is at 250 Hz. When
measuring the sound pressure produced by an earphone in a closed
cavity, a level of 72.3 dB SPL is indicated at 6 kHz. What is the true
sound pressure level in the cavity?
6.15 An actuator is operated with a dc bias of FB and an alternating
sinusoidal drive whose amplitude is V0 volts. If F1 and F2 are the
amplitudes of the electrostatic forces at the fundamental and second
harmonic frequencies respectively, show that
(A knowledge of elementary algebra and trigonometric functions is neces-
sary. See Appendix A. Remember that the electrostatic force is
proportional to the square of the applied voltage.) Use this formula
(whether or not you have been able to derive it) to find the force level
in the harmonic relative to that in the fundamental when the bias is
500 volts and the drive voltage is 25 volts rms (from the rms value,
first find the amplitude V0).
6.16 A condenser microphone has been calibrated using the insert-voltage
method so that its open-circuit sensitivity M0 is known accurately. If
this sensitivity is used without correction as the basis of measurement,
calculate the error in decibels if the preamplifier has an input
capacitance of 0.5 pF and the microphone has a capacitance of 15 pF.
6.17* Attempt the photometric reciprocity experiment described in the text.
It does work. The light source can be a 25-W lamp from a motor car
(with suitable power supply), but a more powerful light might be
needed unless you have a photometer that is able to operate at low
light levels. Cover both tables with black cloth so that it will not
matter if the photometer is unable to detect light from beneath it. Try

the experiment acoustically. The source needs to be physically small
so that its radiation is practically uniform. A small loudspeaker
supplied with masking noise from an audiometer would be appropri-
ate.
6.18 What is it about the reciprocity method that makes it particularly
important as a method for calibrating microphones? Not all micro-
phones can be calibrated by the reciprocity method. What special
characteristic is essential?
6.19 List the principal components of a sound-level meter and draw a
block diagram to show how they are combined.
6.20 Why is it necessary to square the electrical signal within a sound-level
meter?
6.21 What is meant by frequency weighting in the context of sound-level
measurements? Describe the features of the A-weighting function.
Without weighting, a sound-level meter indicates 52.7 dB SPL when
measuring the level of a narrow band of noise centred on 250 Hz.
What reading is expected when A-weighting is included?
6.22* In this exercise we carry out arithmetically the operation of squaring
and averaging a signal. A spreadsheet would be helpful but is not
essential. We know that after amplification the signal voltage v in a
sound-level meter is proportional to the sound pressure at the
microphone. Suppose that the voltage varies with time t according to
the equation
where v is in volts and t is in seconds. Choose a series of increasing values
of t in the range t = 1.5 to t = 2.5 milliseconds. You need at least ten
values, but more would be better. For each t, calculate v and v2.
Remember that the argument of the sine function is in radians. Make
a table listing v and v2 and t. Plot graphs of v and v2 against t,
drawing smooth lines through the data points. By 'counting squares',
estimate the area between the graph of v2 and the t-axis. The area
should be expressed in units of volt2 x seconds. Divide the area by
the range of t (i.e., divide by 1 x 10-3 seconds). Notice that this gives
the average value of v2 over the chosen time interval. Compare your
result with the mathematically correct value, which is 1.92 volt2. For
those who have a spreadsheet program, an extension or an alternative
to this question is as follows. Create a column of values of t from 1.5
to 2.5 ms, in steps of s milliseconds. Tabulate v, v2, and v2s. Add all

220 Acoustics for Audiologists
the numbers in the v2s column except the last. Observe that the sum
(divided by the range, 1 ms) tends to 1.92 volt2 as the step size s is
decreased.
6.23 During discharge through a resistance, the voltage V on a capacitor
falls exponentially from its initial value V0 according to the equation
V = V0e~t/r, where the time constant T is equal to RC. If the initial
voltage is 2.2 mV, calculate the voltage after a time equal to 3 time
constants. If the time constant is equal to 125 ms, what time is
required for the voltage to fall from 1.0 mV to 0.1 mV?
6.24 RC averaging is sometimes called 'exponential time-weighted averag-
ing'. Why is this? If the IEC slow response is selected (time con-
stant = 1 second), what weight is given to the squared sound pressure
of an event that occurred 2.5 seconds ago compared with the
weighting for events at the moment of observation?
6.25 What is loudness? Explain how loudness can be measured in phons.
How is loudness on the sone scale related to loudness level in phons?
Calculate the loudness in sones for a band of noise whose loudness
level is (a) 40 phons and (b) 97 phons.
6.26 What loudness level in phons corresponds to a loudness of (a) 1 sone
and (b) 20 sones?
6.27 What is the equal energy principle concerning the harmful conse-
quences of exposure to noise?
6.28 Define sound exposure level. Calculate the A-weighted sound exposure
level for a 30-second exposure, without protection, to noise at 103
dB(A). A task requires an employee to be exposed to this noise for 1
minute. Ear protectors are to be worn so that the sound exposure
level at the ear will not exceed 100 dB. What is the least attenuation
that the ear protectors must produce?
6.29 Explain what is meant by a daily personal noise exposure level. During
an 8-hour shift an employee's task entails three exposures, each
lasting 30 seconds, to noise at 112 dB(A), and a single 3-hour
exposure to 92 dB(A). Calculate the personal noise exposure level for
the day.
6.30 If a man works for 15 years in a factory where the noise level is
83 dB(A), express his noise exposure as a noise immission level. If the
man subsequently works at another site where the noise level is 91
dB(A), what is the combined noise immission level for both periods
of employment after 6 months in the new job?

Impedance
Impedance is a term and a concept widely used in the physical sciences,
particularly in the electrical and electronic technologies, in mechanics, and
in acoustics. Its special importance for audiology is in the description of
middle ear and cochlear physiology and in the assessment of middle ear
function. Those who have some knowledge of electronics will have little
difficulty understanding the subject, but for many audiologists it is trouble-
some. The difficulty is probably that it involves mathematical ideas for
which there are no obvious physical analogies. Attempts to explain imped-
ance in terms of more familiar concepts such as 'flow of energy' are definitely
misleading. The way to understand the subject is to approach it directly,
accepting that it is somewhat technical and that it does require careful
thinking. It is hoped that this chapter will provide a clear explanation of the
ideas and terminology. The underlying principles will be demonstrated and
the necessary mathematical ideas introduced as required.
Although it is acoustic impedance that is directly relevant to audiological
practice, it should be understood that the same ideas are found almost
identically in the theory of electrical circuits and in the description of
mechanical systems (including the middle ear and cochlea!); indeed, electri-
cal, mechanical, and acoustic impedance often appear together in the same
problem, for example, in the design of electroacoustic transducers such as
loudspeakers. Moreover, impedance has a sibling called admittance, and
several cousins such as resistance, reactance, inertance, and so on; the entire
family will be the subject of the following account. Before describing
acoustic impedance, we will consider electrical impedance because this is the
most widely known form and a general description is possible without the
need to introduce an entirely new terminology. We will then consider
mechanical impedanceâthe subject is important in its own right and
provides a good introduction to the acoustic case, particularly because
mechanical systems are often easier to visualize than their acoustic counter-
parts. Finally, we will discuss how these ideas apply to acoustics, both as
the specific acoustic impedance in an extended medium and as acoustic
impedance within acoustic systems.
Resistance is a property of electrical conductors. It defines the relationship
between the current carried by a conductor and the electrical potential
221

222 Acoustics for Audiologists
difference (the voltage) across it. For most practical purposes the resistance
of a given conductor is constant, that is, independent of the strength of the
current. Its electrical effect is the same for both steady and varying currents.
The Ohm's law relationship is
If the current has a sinusoidal variation, then
so that
The voltage waveform is therefore exactly the same as the current waveform
(both are perfect sinusoids) and the voltage and current have exactly the
same phase, so if an electrical circuit contains only resistors, we can find the
voltage across its terminals simply by multiplying the current by the
resistance of the circuit. The answer we obtain is the same for direct and
alternating currents (Figure 7.1).
Now, although there are many occasions when such calculations are
required, they exemplify a particular rather than a general case because most
FIG. 7.1 Current and voltage in a resistor.

Impedance 223
FIG. 7.2 Relationship between voltage and current for an arbitrary
impedance, Z.
electrical circuits have components that are not simply resistances. Current
and voltage are in phase only if the circuit is, or behaves as, a perfect
resistance, but in general the phases differ (Figure 7.2). It is then impossible
to calculate the voltage due to an alternating current, at any instant during
the cycle, by a simple arithmetic multiplication. To understand this, consider
that there are times in the current cycle when the current is momentarily
zero but the voltage, which has a different phase, is not zero. Obviously,
multiplying the current by a factor will not give the desired result.
The problem is solved by defining a property of the circuit called
impedance. Impedance behaves rather like resistanceâindeed, a component
of it is resistanceâbut it is treated as a vector whose magnitude is the ratio
of the peak voltage to the peak current and whose direction shows the
relative phase of the voltage and the current. Fortunately, working with
impedance is not the daunting prospect it might seem and we will show
presently how it is done. There are, however, two conditions. The first is that
we can deal only with sinusoidal variation (complex waveforms must be
handled in terms of their component sinusoids), and the second is that
systems must be linear. In the electrical case, for example, this means that if
the current is a sinusoid then the voltage has also to be a sinusoid of the
same frequency.

224 Acoustics for Audiologists
Impedance as a Vector
Suppose an alternating current is flowing in a circuit that is not simply a
resistance. We observe that the voltage across the circuit is not in phase with
the current. The task is to calculate the amplitude and phase of the voltage,
knowing the current and the impedance of the circuit. Impedance has two
parts, resistance and reactance, defined in such a way that when the
alternating current is multiplied by resistance, we obtain an alternating
voltage in phase with the current; and when it is multiplied by reactance, we
obtain an alternating voltage whose phase differs from that of the current
by one quarter of a cycle. Note that reactance behaves in the same way as
resistance but additionally contains the 'instruction' for the quarter-cycle
phase change. When the voltages derived from the resistive and reactive
parts are added, the result is the alternating voltage that actually appears
across the circuit.
To show how this process works, suppose that the current is given by
where Ip is the peak current, that is, the amplitude of the current waveform.
Let the resistive part of the impedance be R and the reactive part be X.
Multiplying the current by the impedance produces the two voltages VR and
Fx where
and
or
It can be shown that when VR and Vx are added, they produce the voltage
where
and

Impedance 225
or
The problem of finding V given I is therefore solved provided we know
the components R and X of the impedance. The relationships just demon-
strated suggest that we can represent these components as vectors and add
them to obtain Z. This representation is shown in Figure 7.3, where,
conventionally, resistance is drawn horizontally and reactance is drawn
vertically upwards for a phase lead or downwards for a phase lag.
The magnitude of the vector impedance is the ratio of the peak voltage to
the peak current, and therefore also the ratio of the root mean squares of
these quantities. That is,
FIG. 7.3 (a) Vector representation of impedance. A current / flows through the
circuit whose impedance is Z The voltage across the circuit has a component VR
that is in phase with the current, and a voltage Vx that leads the current by a
quarter cycle. The sum of these voltages is V. Its waveform leads that of the
current by the angle $. (b) Same as for part (a) except that the reactive
component of the voltage lags the current by a quarter cycle. The voltage V
across the circuit now lags the current by the angle <i>.

226 Acoustics for Audiologists
Example
Suppose a circuit comprises a resistance of 400 ohms in series with an
inductance that has a reactance of 300 ohms. To understand this example it
is not necessary to know what is meant by inductance except that it is a
circuit component that provides the stated reactance and that the voltage
across it leads the current by n/2 (90Â°). If the rms current is 100 mA, what
is the rms value of the voltage and what is the phase of the voltage relative
to the current?
To answer this question we calculate the impedance Z and the phase
angle </> either by scale drawing or by using trigonometric tables or an
electronic calculator. The result is as follows:
and
This angle is 36.9Â° or just over one-tenth of a cycle. The voltage across the
circuit has therefore an rms value of 100 x 500 â 50,000 mV (i.e., 50 volts),
and the voltage leads the current by 36.9Â° (Figure 7.4).
It is essential to understand the principle at work here. It is based on the
fact that any sinusoidal vibration can be expressed as the sum of two other
vibrations of the same frequency that differ in phase by + n/2. Multiplying
the current by the impedance is an operation that goes beyond ordinary
arithmetic because it produces, in effect, two such component vibrations.
The process is exactly the same as that used in other applications, such as
mechanics, to handle vector quantities. A single force, for example, can be
replaced by two other forces acting in perpendicular directions. The import-
ance of this is that if several forces act simultaneously, their components in
the two directions can be added separately and then recombined to give the
strength and direction of the resultant force. The same process is used to
add impedances; that is, the resistive and reactive parts are added separately,
and the combined impedance has the effect of the total resistance plus the
total reactance.
Impedance as a Complex Number
It would be a great labour and a serious barrier to analysis if vector
diagrams and trigonometric calculation were required for all terms involv-

Impedance 227

ing impedance. It is one of the great joys of alternating-current theory (and
acoustic theory likewise) to find that these difficulties are all but completely
removed with the introduction of complex numbers. It is undoubtedly the
role of complex numbers in solving practical problems in electronics that
has made the teaching of this branch of mathematics an indispensable part
of the technical curriculum. An introduction to the theory of complex
numbers is given in Appendix A; if necessary, this should be consulted before
proceeding further in this chapter.
Impedance can be represented by a complex number in which, by
universal convention, the resistive part of the impedance is the real part of
the number and the reactive part of impedance is the imaginary part of the
number (Figure 7.5). Accordingly, this is written as
Reactance is multiplied by + j for a phase lead and by âj for a phase lag.
Notice that Z is a complex number, whereas R and X are ordinary numbers.
It will be immediately evident that the complex number expresses imped-

228 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 7.5 Using complex numbers to represent impedance.
ance in the required vector form because the Argand diagram representing
this number is identical to the vector diagram shown in Figure 7.3a. The
advantage of the complex form is that Z can be treated as an ordinary
algebraic variable. The value and simplicity of this will become apparent in
the sections that follow.
The representation of Z as a complex number does, however, introduce a
difficulty which needs some explanation. By definition, the ratio of the
voltage V to the current / is equal to the impedance Z; that is,
Now, if Z is a complex number, then V and / must also be complex; that is,
they must have real and imaginary parts. But voltage and current are
physical quantities and entirely real to anyone who has had to pay an
electricity bill. We have to interpret the previous expressions as saying that
V and I are vectors whose lengths are the real numbers that correspond to
the amplitude of the alternating voltage across the terminals of the circuit
and the amplitude of the current flowing in it. The ratio of the number of
volts to the number of amperes is a real number equal to the magnitude of
Z, and the phase of the voltage relative to that of the current is given by the
direction of Z relative to the real axis. In some texts bold type is used
whenever the variable is a complex number, so that voltage, current, sound
pressure, particle velocity, and so on are printed in bold type. In other texts
no distinction is made in the printed form, and the interpretation, which is

Impedance 229
usually obvious, must be inferred from the context. If it is necessary to
distinguish a vector from its magnitude then magnitude signs can be used
(for example, |Z| is the magnitude of Z).
As already stated, X is a real number. It represents a physical quantity
which we call reactance. When reactance is represented as part of a complex
number, its full specification includes the factor +j or âj and we say that
the imaginary part of the number is +jX or âjX. It would be impossibly
pedantic to make a verbal distinction between X and jX on all occasions,
and the word reactance will be used to denote either the real number part
or the vector as the need arises.
Finally, it is worth commenting that if a system has several components
its reactance is likely to contain a number of separate terms, some preceded
by +j and some by âj. It is not unusual to find a âj term described as a
'negative reactance'. Although not a hanging offence, this is arguably a
misdemeanour. The reactance X is ordinarily positive, implying that a
bigger current needs a bigger voltage to drive it regardless of relative phase
or polarity. The converse is not impossible but is found only in unusual
circumstances involving, for example, active components for which imped-
ance principles are inapplicable. The point can be made by analogy. If a
stone is thrown upwards its motion will be retarded by the downwardly
directed gravitational acceleration. If the upward direction is (arbitrarily)
taken to be positive, the gravitational force on the stone is âmg. It would
be perverse to say in this case that the stone had a 'negative mass'.
Power Dissipation
Suppose that an electrical source of alternating current is connected to the
terminals of a circuit that has reactive as well as resistive components. The
impedance presented to the source at the terminals of the circuit is given by
Equation 7.1, where R represents the combined effect of all parts of the
circuit that contribute to the in-phase component of the current and X
represents the combined effect of all parts that contribute to the component
of current 'in quadrature', that is leading or lagging the voltage by a quarter
cycle. When these components are added, the overall phase difference
between current and voltage is $ radians, where
It is easily shown that the average power W supplied by the source in each
cycle is given by
7.2

230 Acoustics for Audiologists
where the voltage V and the current / are root mean square (rms) values.
From Figure 7.3 we see that
so that
and because
The resistive part of the complex impedance is associated with energy
dissipation, and the reactive part is associated with stored energy. If the
impedance is entirely resistive, all the energy supplied by the source appears
as heat generated in resistances within a circuit. At the other extreme, if the
impedance is purely reactive, that is, if Z has only an imaginary part, then
the phase angle is Â±n/2 and its cosine is zero. From Equation 7.2 we see
that in these circumstances the power dissipation W is zero. Yet a voltmeter
connected across the terminals of the circuit would register a finite rms
voltage V, and an ammeter in series with the supply to the circuit would
register a finite rms current I. This current is sometimes described as
'wattless'. In part of each cycle, energy supplied by the source is stored in
reactive elements of the circuit, either through electric charge on capacitors
or through magnetic fields around inductors; in other parts of the cycle,
some of the stored energy is returned to the source. The same principle
applies in mechanical and acoustic systems.
It should be understood that the resistance R and reactance X in the
complex impedance are representative of the entire system to which that
impedance relates. Although no energy is dissipated in the reactive compo-
nents themselves, such components may contribute to the resistive part of
the overall impedance. Similarly, the reactive part of the impedance may
contain terms derived from individual resistances within the system even
though resistances themselves are incapable of storing energy. This will be
demonstrated later when a mechanical system is described.
Equivalent Circuits
In the remainder of this chapter we turn our attention to mechanical and
acoustic systems. As already stated, the mechanical and acoustic elements of

Impedance 231
such systems have electrical counterparts that behave in exactly the same
way so far as impedance is concerned. We will see that velocity is analogous
to electric current, and mechanical force or acoustic pressure is analogous
to the electrical potential difference across circuit components. It is therefore
not surprising to find that mechanical and acoustic systems can be repre-
sented by their equivalent electrical circuits. This representation is nearly
always helpful because electrical components can actually be joined together
by pieces of wire to form a real circuit, whereas the corresponding mechan-
ical or acoustic connections often have to be imagined. We will use
equivalent circuits to assist the descriptions that follow. In doing so, elastic
components will be shown by the symbol for a capacitor, mass components
by the symbol for an inductor, and all forms of resistance by the usual
electrical symbol. Inductance is analogous to mass, and capacitance is
analogous to elastic compliance (the reciprocal of stiffness).
Mechanical Impedance
Mechanical impedance is used in the context of mechanical systems that
undergo vibration. Just as electrical impedance is defined as the ratio of
voltage to current, so mechanical impedance is the ratio of force to velocity.
Mechanical impedance has a resistive component related to fluid friction
and it has reactive components associated with mass and stiffness, which are
the mechanical analogues of electrical inductance and capacitance. In
understanding the origins of mechanical impedance it is necessary to
remember that the velocity of any moving object is the rate of change of its
positionâthat is, the rate of change of its 'displacement' or distance from
a given positionâand that its acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
For harmonic (sinusoidal) motion, the velocity leads the displacement by a
quarter of a cycle and the acceleration leads the velocity by the same
amount. The acceleration is therefore half a period ahead of the displace-
ment, in antiphase with it. It must also be understood that when oscillations
have an angular frequency o>, the velocity amplitude is co times the
displacement amplitude, and the acceleration amplitude is co times the
velocity amplitude.
Suppose that a vibrating object has an instantaneous velocity u given by
The corresponding displacement Â£ and acceleration a are therefore given by

232 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 7.6 The components of mechanical impedance.
and
Imagine that the vibrating object is a spring whose mass is assumed to be
negligible. We suppose that the spring is fixed at one end and that the
vibration at the free end is maintained by a sinusoidal force F. This force
must be equal to the stiffness s of the spring multiplied by the displacement
Â£ where the force is applied (Figure 7.6). The oscillatory force is therefore
given by
Comparing this with Equation 7.3, we see that the force is a sinusoid whose
amplitude is s/co times the amplitude of the velocity and whose phase lags

Impedance 233
the velocity by n/2. The mechanical impedance of the spring is therefore a
pure reactance Xs which can be represented by the imaginary number
At the other extreme, if the vibrating object is a mass m, then the force
required to maintain its oscillation is the mass multiplied by the acceler-
ation; that is,
Again, comparison with Equation 7.3 shows that the force waveform is a
sinusoid whose amplitude is com times the velocity amplitude and whose
phase leads the velocity by n/2. The mass therefore contributes the pure
reactance
The real part of the mechanical impedance is the mechanical resistance. It
creates an oscillatory force in phase with the velocity and having an
amplitude R times that of the velocity. The oscillatory force is therefore
Mechanical resistance is often called 'friction', but the term needs to be
used carefully. Friction is usually thought of as the force that opposes the
sliding of one solid object over another, but in the definition of R it is fluid
friction that matters. Solid friction is more or less independent of the relative
speeds of the surfaces in contact, at least once some movement has
commenced, but fluid friction generates a force that is directly proportional
to velocity. We do in fact have everyday experience of the consequences of
fluid friction: doors fitted with hydraulic dampers are easy to move slowly
but much harder to move rapidly; a spoon in a jar of treacle falls slowly
under just its own weight, but rapid movement requires great effort.
Mechanical resistance is associated with friction in joints and bearings and
with viscoelastic processes. It is also produced intentionally in devices such
as hydraulic dampers. The symbol representing resistance in Figure 7.6 is
supposed to suggest a fluid damper in which the movement of a central
piston relative to a cylinder is opposed by the viscosity of the fluid that it
contains. The fluid is not shown.
Units
Mechanical impedance and its components, resistance and reactance, ex-
press the ratio of force to velocity. The unit of measurement is therefore

234 Acoustics for Audiologists
Nsm-1. This unit may be called a mechanical ohm, but the name is not
widely used. Although the electrical ohm is unambiguously an MKS unit
(one based on metres, kilograms, and seconds), the same is not true for
mechanical and acoustic ohms because these names came into being at a
time when the CGS (centimetre-gram-second) system was still in use. To
prevent ambiguity, add the prefix 'MKS' or avoid the name altogether.
Forced Harmonic Oscillations (Series Configuration)
Chapter 2 described an elementary oscillator comprising a mass, a spring,
and a damper. The response of this system to the action of a steady
sinusoidal force can be calculated using the principles just described. The
ease with which this is possible demonstrates the value of the 'impedance
concept' and the advantage of using complex numbers.
Referring to Figure 7.7, we see that the oscillatory force F is applied at
the connection between the free ends of the mass and the damper. It is
opposed by the sum of the forces due to the inertia of the mass, the elastic
FIG. 7.7 Forced oscillation in a mechanical system, series configuration.

Impedance 235
compression of the spring, and the fluid friction in the damper. The figure
also shows the equivalent electrical circuit. Each of the mechanical elements
undergoes an identical displacement and therefore moves with the same
velocity. The oscillator is therefore the mechanical analogue of a series
electrical circuit. The defining feature of a series circuit is that the same
current flows in each component, and the voltage at the input terminals is
the sum of the voltage differences across each of the elements. The total
mechanical impedance1 Z of the oscillator is the sum of the impedances of
its components, so that
Collecting the imaginary parts (the reactances of the mass and the spring)
gives
The magnitude of the impedance is therefore
and the phase angle 0 is given by
The peak force in each cycle is |Z| times the peak velocity, and the force
leads the velocity by the angle </>.
The first thing to notice about this result is that the impedance changes
with frequency, passing through a minimum value when com = s/co (Figure
7.8). The frequency at which the minimum occurs is the resonance frequency
co0, so that
or
Notice that the reactance vanishes at this frequency and that the oscillator
then presents a pure resistance to the input force. Below the resonance
frequency the phase angle is negative so that the force lags the velocity,
whereas above resonance it leads the velocity. At low frequencies the
acceleration and the velocity are low and the driving force is opposed
^o keep the notation simple, the same symbol Z will be used for all forms of impedance.
Subscripts will be added where it is necessary to make a distinction.

mechanical impedance.
mainly by the action of the spring; at high frequencies the inertia of the mass
is dominant. Going from a low to a high frequency, the system passes from
springlike behaviour to masslike behaviour.
An important characteristic of the oscillator is its frequency response in
the neighbourhood of the resonance frequency. Suppose that the amplitude
Fp of the driving force is held constant while the frequency is varied. The
change in velocity amplitude Fp/\Z\ with frequency is the velocity response
of the oscillator, and resonance is revealed by a maximum in the response
curve (Figure 7.9). The 'sharpness' of the peak is governed by the Q-factor,
as described in Chapter 2. It is given by
where co0 = ^/s/m is the angular frequency at resonance.

Impedance 237
FIG. 7.9 Velocity response of a mechanical oscillator, series configuration.
To see how this formula is obtained, recall that Q can be defined
as 2i times the mean stored energy in the oscillator divided by the
energy that has to be supplied during each cycle to maintain the
oscillation at resonance. The only components capable of storing energy
are the spring and the mass that form the reactive part of the impedance.
We have seen that the reactance vanishes at resonance and there
is then no external force acting on the mass-spring combination other
than the reaction at the fixed end of the spring. It follows that, overall,
no energy is supplied or removed from the mass and the springâthey
exchange energy with one another, but their total energy remains constant.
At the moment when the velocity is greatest all the stored energy
is kinetic, namely, 1/2Wp, where up is the velocity amplitude at resonance.
The external force has only to overcome the friction in the damper.
The average rate at which work is done on the damper is (urms)2R.
[Compare this with the formula for the heat produced by an electric
current in a resistor, W = (/rms)2^.] The rms value of a sinusoidally
varying quantity is equal to the amplitude divided by ^/2, so that
in terms of the velocity amplitude, the power dissipation in the damper
is ^UpR. The energy supplied during the cycle is the power multiplied
by the period 2n/co0. Therefore,

238 Acoustics for Audiologists
Forced Harmonic Oscillations (Parallel Configuration)
It is interesting to see what happens if the driving force is applied to the
spring instead of the mass. The appropriate rearrangement of the mechan-
ical system and the new equivalent circuit are shown in Figure 7.10.
Although the mechanical parts seem to be in series, the equivalent circuit
requires parallel connections. This is because the force applied to the free
end of the spring is the same as the force exerted by the other end of the
spring on the mass. This force is opposed by the inertia of the mass plus the
friction in the damper. The mass and the damper have the same velocity,
and this velocity added to that of the spring is the velocity at the input. It
has to be understood that 'the velocity of the spring' means the rate at which
one end of the spring moves relative to the other irrespective of any
movement of the spring as a whole.
Let Zt be the impedance of the mass and damper and let Z2 be the
impedance of the spring. Then the impedance presented to the driving force
is Z, where
FIG. 7.10 
Forced oscillation in a mechanical system, parallel configuration.

Impedance 239
At this point we could, as before, write the impedances in terms of their
real and imaginary parts and proceed to an expression for Z. We would
soon discover that this required some long-winded algebra. It is tempting to
look for an easier alternative. The easier way is to use admittance instead of
impedance. Admittance is simply the reciprocal of impedance, that is, the
ratio of velocity to force (expressed as a complex number). This quantity is
usually represented by the symbol Y; the preceding expression then becomes
The simplification shows why parallel circuits are best dealt with in terms
of admittance. Anticipating comments to be made later, it may be noticed
that the term otoadmittance is sometimes used in connection with the
acoustic measurement of middle ear function. At low frequencies the
external ear and the eardrum are effectively in parallel.
To find Y, it is first necessary to express its constituents in terms of their
real and imaginary parts. Accordingly,
and
When Y1 and Y2 are added to obtain Y, the result, after some tidying up, is
found to be
The magnitude of the admittance is therefore
Notice that the real and imaginary parts of the complex admittance each
contain terms in R and m; the mass contributes to the in-phase component
of the admittance, and the resistance contributes to the quadrature compo-
nent.
As the frequency of the driving force is increased, the admittance changes,
passing through a minimum at a frequency very close to that for which the
imaginary part vanishes (Figure 7.11). Because admittance is the ratio of
velocity to force, the velocity will be a minimum at this frequency. If the
amplitude of the driving force is kept constant, the response of the system

240 Acoustics for Audiologists

the mechanical admittance.
can be given in terms of velocity, and the existence of a minimum in the
velocity is then an example of antiresonance. On the other hand, if the
velocity amplitude at the free end of the spring is held constant, the force at
this point becomes a measure of the response of the system. The force
response passes through a maximum corresponding to a resonance (Figure
7.12). It can be shown that the Q-factor for this resonance is equal to coTm/R,
where cor is the resonance frequency whose value is given by
We therefore see that in the parallel configuration the resonance frequency

becomes slightly lower if the damping is increased, whereas in the series
configuration it is independent of the damping.
Specific Acoustic Impedance
There are two kinds of acoustic impedance: the first, specific acoustic
impedance, is helpful in understanding the propagation of sound in an
extended medium and the reflection and transmission of sound as it passes
from one medium to another; the second, known simply as acoustic
impedance, is required when describing the radiation of sound from a
vibrating surface and the propagation of sound in confining systems such as
pipes and ducts. The latter include musical wind instruments, components
attached to loudspeakers (horns, for example), acoustic attenuators in
engine silencers, and, of course, the structures of the external ear. To begin
the discussion we look briefly at specific impedance and give examples of its
application.
Specific acoustic impedance is the ratio of sound pressure to particle
velocity. It depends on the physical characteristics of the medium in which
the sound is transmitted and on the type of wave. Expressing this symboli-
cally, we write the specific impedance Z as
where p and u are the sound pressure and particle velocity. As previously, we

242 Acoustics for Audiologists
take Z to be a complex number with resistive and reactive parts R and X
such that
It can be shown that the specific acoustic impedance in a plane progres-
sive wave is given by
where p0 is the density of the medium and c is the velocity of sound. These
are physical characteristics of a medium that depend entirely on its molecu-
lar composition and physical state (temperature and pressure); for this
reason, the specific acoustic impedance for plane waves is also called the
characteristic impedance of the medium. The characteristic impedance is an
important acoustic property, especially in the context of sound transmission.
In a plane wave, the sound pressure and the particle velocity have the same
phase, and the specific acoustic impedance is therefore a pure acoustic
resistance that depends only on the medium and not on the frequency of the
sound. Resistance is associated with energy dissipation. In a sound wave, it
relates to the energy needed to extend the sound field as the wave advances
into the hitherto undisturbed medium. The rate at which this energy is
supplied is proportional to the sound intensity, which, in a plane wave, is
(prms)2/p0c, where prms is the root mean square sound pressure.2
If the wavefronts are not plane, then the specific acoustic impedance is
not entirely resistive. For example, in spherical waves close to a simple
source, the specific impedance is given by
where r is the distance from the source and k â 2n/l. The reactive part of
this impedance is preceded by +j, indicating that the sound pressure leads
the particle velocity by the angle </> such that
Notice that if the distance from the source is increased to the point where
kr Â» 1, then the impedance becomes resistive with the same value pQc as
exists for plane waves. The reactive component is, however, significant in
regions close to the source. Its existence implies that the particle velocity can
be thought of as having two components, one in phase with the sound
pressure and one lagging the pressure by 7t/2. The kinetic energy associated

resistor.

Impedance 243
with the reactive part is not propagated with the wave and makes no
contribution to the acoustic intensity.
Units of Measurement
Specific acoustic impedance has dimensions of pressure divided by velocity
and can be measured in Pa s m-1 or Nsm- 3. Alternatively, we can express
impedance in terms of the base units, mass [M], length [L], and time [T],
as follows:
In terms of base units, the unit of specific acoustic impedance is therefore
m~2kgs"1. This unit is sometimes called a myl or MKS rayl (after Lord
Rayleigh).
Reflection and Transmission at a Boundary
In this context a boundary is an extended surface that is created when one
substance is in contact with another. The surface of a lake, for example, is
a boundary that separates the water from the air. Similarly, the surface of a
window is a boundary between glass and air. When sound passes from one
medium to another, there is an abrupt change (a discontinuity) in the
specific acoustic impedance at the boundary. A general consequence of this
is that sound is partially reflected and partially transmitted where the
change of medium occurs.
Suppose that a sound wave travelling in medium 1 is incident on a
boundary with medium 2, as shown in Figure 7.13. The boundary is
assumed to be perpendicular to the direction in which the waves are
travelling. We can use subscripts 1 and 2 to distinguish properties of the two
media, and subscripts i, r, and t to distinguish variables in the incident,
reflected, and transmitted waves respectively. Now, although the impedance
is not continuous across the boundary, quantities such as sound pressure

244 Acoustics for Audiologists

Reflection and transmission of sound at a boundary between media

and particle velocity are continuous; that is, they do not undergo a sudden
change. At points very close to the boundary, the sound pressure and
particle velocity in medium 1 are the same as in medium 2. At first sight this
may seem paradoxical and difficult to understand, but its truth is evident
when one considers that an abrupt change in velocity would require infinite
acceleration and the existence of infinite forces within the media. The sound
pressure in the first medium is the sum of the pressures in the incident and
the reflected waves (principle of superposition), and to preserve continuity
this must equal the pressure in the transmitted wave, so that
By similar reasoning,
Also, from the definition of specific impedance,
and
The minus sign in the second of these equations is needed because the
reflected wave is propagated towards the source.
It only requires some simple algebra to show that these considerations
lead to the following expressions for the sound pressures in the reflected anc
transmitted waves:

Impedance 245
and
These results show us immediately that if the specific impedances are
equal, that is, if Z1 = Z2, then pT is zero and pt = pi so that the wave is
transmitted from one medium to the other without reflection or change in
amplitude. In all other circumstances, however, at least some reflection must
occur. It is important once again to notice that although impedance is a
vector represented by a complex number Z, it is treated as an ordinary
algebraic quantity in the mathematics leading to Equations 7.8 and 7.9. The
ratios of the sound pressures on the left-hand sides of these equations are
also complex numbers having both real and imaginary parts. The physical
meaning of this is that in general the reflection and transmission of sound
involve a change in phase as well as amplitude.
The propagation of plane waves is, however, a special case for which a
simpler result is obtained because the impedance in a plane wave is purely
resistive. For a plane wave the complex impedance Z can be replaced by the
characteristic impedance pc, which is an ordinary number. The algebra will
look tidier if we represent the ratio of the characteristic impedances in the
two media by a single letter r, that is, if we let
With these substitutions in Equations 7.8 and 7.9 we find that
and
No phase change is involved except that if r < 1 the ratio pr/pi is negative.
This means that if the impedance in the second medium is less than that in
the first medium, the reflected wave is in antiphase with the incident wave.
The transmitted wave, however, always has the same phase as the incident
wave.
To know how much sound energy is reflected or transmitted, we need the
sound intensities rather than the sound pressures. The ratio of the intensity
in the reflected wave to that in the incident wave is called the sound power
reflection coefficient, ar. Similarly, the ratio of the intensity in the transmitted
wave to that in the incident wave is the sound power transmission coefficient,
at. For plane waves, as we have seen, sound intensity is equal to the square

246 Acoustics for Audiologists
of the rms sound pressure divided by the characteristic impedance. The
reflection and transmission coefficients can therefore be written as
and
We can substitute pc for Z in Equations 7.8 and 7.9 as before to obtain
and
Because it has been tacitly assumed that no energy is absorbed at the
boundary, the fraction of the incident energy that is reflected added to the
fraction that is transmitted must equal unity, that is,
Equations 7.10 and 7.11 are, of course, consistent with this requirement.
In the foregoing text we have seen how the reflection and transmission of
sound at the interface between two media depend on the characteristic
impedances. There are circumstances where it is necessary to reduce
reflection (and enhance transmission) as far as possible. This aim can be
achieved by matching the impedance values on either side of the boundary.
Examples are the use of 'rho-c' rubber as a sealing compound in hydropho-
nes and, in medical ultrasound, the application of oil to the patient's skin to
form a nonreflecting layer where contact is made with the transducer.
Acoustic Impedance
Whereas specific acoustic impedance describes the relationship between
sound pressure and the oscillatory movement of sound particles, ordinary
acoustic impedance is concerned with the oscillatory flow of air at a surface.
Acoustic impedance is therefore helpful in describing the interaction be-
tween sound fields and vibrating surfaces that are sources or receivers of
sound. The tympanic membrane is a prime example, and measurement of
acoustic impedance at the membrane is an important part of diagnostic

Impedance 247
audiology. Acoustic impedance is also useful in the treatment of sound
transmission in closed systems. A simple cylindrical pipe is an example; for
greater complexity, openings, side branches, and other attachments may be
added. The chief example in audiology is the external ear, which can be
thought of acoustically as a pipe of somewhat variable cross section
terminating in the tympanic membrane and opening into an acoustically
complex system involving the auricle, the head, and the torso. In general,
the use of acoustic impedance is limited to circumstances where lateral
dimensions (diameters of pipes) are small compared with the wavelength of
sound, but there are no restrictions on the axial dimensions. Taking a pipe
as an example, we would say that the sound is distributed along its length
and that physical characteristics such as resistance, compliance, and acoustic
mass (to be described presently) are likewise distributed. The transmission
of sound in a 'distributed' system is then the acoustic equivalent of the
transmission of high-frequency electric current in transmission lines and
aerials. Systems in which the axial dimensions are short compared with the
wavelength constitute a special case. A short pipe, for example, can be
treated as a discrete acoustic element. Acoustic systems comprising such
elements are equivalent to ordinary 'lumped' electrical circuits. Unfortunate-
ly for audiologists, the length of the external ear canal is such that it behaves
as a discrete element only at low frequencies. This is a complication in
middle ear measurement, which, accordingly, is usually undertaken at 226
or 660 Hz. It is also a problem in some hearing aid 'real-ear' measurement
because higher frequencies cannot be ignored and the microphone tube must
therefore be placed close to the eardrum.
Acoustic impedance involves a quantity called volume velocity. To under-
stand what this is, imagine that sound is incident directly on the surface of
an object whose vibrations are either caused by the sound (as in a
microphone) or are the source of it (as in a loudspeaker or earphone). The
particle velocity near to the surface must be the same as that of the surface
itself. As the sound particles vibrate, their corporate movement is associated
with an alternating flow of air perpendicular to the surface, so that at any
instant the volume U flowing per second at the surface must be the product
of the particle velocity u and the surface area S; that is,
provided that u is uniform across the area.3 The volume flow U is the
3In more general and rigorous definitions to be found in textbooks and standard glossaries, the
particle velocity u is not assumed to be uniform or necessarily directed perpendicular to the
surface. Instead, it is replaced by its component normal to each element of the surface, and
the product of the normal component and elementary area are summed (integrated) to obtain
the volume velocity over the specified surface.

248 Acoustics for Audiologists
volume velocity. It has the same sinusoidal variation (and of course the
same phase) as the particle velocity. Volume velocity can also be defined
with respect to an imaginary surface rather than the actual surface of some
material object. To see this, suppose that a plane sinusoidal wave is
propagated inside a pipe whose cross-sectional area is S. As the wave
proceeds, the sound particles vibrate to and fro along the axis of the pipe
to produce an alternating flow of air through any cross section in the path
of the wave. The volume U flowing per second is then the particle velocity
u multiplied by the area of the cross section.
The acoustic impedance Z at a specified surface can now be defined as the
ratio of sound pressure to volume velocity; that is,
The definition applies to the acoustic radiation at the interface between a
vibrating surface and the surrounding air and to radiation transmitted
through a specified section of a pipe.
To continue the description of acoustic impedance, it is necessary to
define the terms that make up its real and imaginary parts and explain their
origins. The real part of the acoustic impedance is called acoustic resistance.
It is the ratio of the sound pressure to the component of the volume velocity
that has the same phase as the pressure. For an example, suppose that sound
is incident on the diaphragm of a microphone. To suppress resonances, the
motion of the diaphragm will be damped, either electrically or by some
internal mechanical or acoustic means. The damping is manifest as acoustic
resistance at the surface of the diaphragm. If we look to the human ear for
another example we will find that the acoustic impedance at the tympanic
membrane is resistive over a substantial part of the auditory frequency range
(Figure 7.14). This resistance has its origin in the cochlea, where the
compliance of the basilar membrane interacts with the mass of the cochlear
fluid to create a pressure at the oval window that is in phase with the
velocity of the stapes. The stapes is therefore presented with a resistive
impedance, and this resistance is transferred by the ossicular mechanism to
the tympanic membrane, which appears as a resistance to the incoming
sound.
Acoustic reactance is the ratio of the sound pressure to the component of
volume velocity that leads or lags the pressure by a quarter cycle (Â±7t/2).
When describing mechanical reactance, we considered the reactance of two
basic elements, a spring and a mass. The reactance of the spring was shown
to be s/co (preceded by âj in the complex number representation), and the

Acoustic impedance measured at the eardrum. The solid lines show
average values for men and women. The acoustic resistance is difficult to
measure at frequencies above 2 kHz. Estimated values are shown by the dotted
line. (Based on data from J. Zwislocki in The Nervous System, Vol. 3, ed. D. B.
Tower. Raven Press, New York, 1975.)
reactance of the mass was shown to be com (preceded by +j). Let us now
look for their acoustic counterparts, namely, acoustic compliance and acous-
tic mass.
Acoustic Compliance
In the mechanical case, we chose, arbitrarily, to express the elastic nature of
a spring through its stiffness, s. Although acoustic stiffness exists, it is more
usual to take its reciprocal, acoustic compliance, as the expression of
elasticity in the acoustic sense. Mechanical compliance is the ratio of the
displacement (at the end of a spring) to the applied force; correspondingly,
acoustic compliance (C) is the ratio of the volume displacement to the sound
pressure in a purely elastic system. The acoustic compliance (or just
compliance) at the eardrum is a particularly important measure of middle
ear function, and the term is widely used in clinical audiology. It is therefore
important that its definition should be clearly understood.
To illustrate the meaning of compliance, imagine that a small tube
is closed at one end by a piston and that the piston is connected to a

250 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 7.15 Diagram illustrating the meaning of acoustic compliance.
springâan arrangement which has some similarity with the external ear
(Figure 7.15). If a pressure p is applied to the piston, it will move outwards
until the force pS due to the pressure is balanced by an equal force due to
the elastic compression of the spring. If in the process the piston moves
through a distance Â£, then the volume it displaces will be SÂ£ and the acoustic
compliance at its surface will be SÂ£/p. In other words, the acoustic compli-
ance of an acoustic element is defined as the volume displacement that is
produced by the application of unit pressure.4 There are other definitions
that amount to the same thing. For example, acoustic compliance is the
reciprocal of acoustic stiffness, which may be defined thus:
In a system in which friction and inertia are negligible, quotient of sound
pressure by the resulting in-phase volume displacement during sinusoidal
motion.5
It is not meaningful to ascribe an acoustic reactance to a particular elastic
element unless the motion is sinusoidal, and the requirement for sinusoidal
motion is made explicit in the second of the definitions just presented.
Acoustic compliance is analogous to mechanical compliance and is the exact
analogue of electrical capacitance, acoustic pressure being analogous to
voltage and volume displacement being analogous to electric charge. We
usually expect the compliance of a spring or the capacitance of a condenser
to be independent of the waveform of the applied force or voltage, and the
same is true for acoustic compliance. In principle, then, the acoustic
compliance of an element could be measured at any frequency or at no
frequency at all, that is, as the volume change in response to the application
of a steady pressure. One should be mindful, however, to choose the

electroacoustics.

Impedance 251
appropriate elastic constants when compliance is calculated: a greater
compression of the air is produced by a steady pressure than by a rapidly
alternating one because the former process is isothermal whereas the latter
is likely to be adiabatic. As will be seen, the compliance of an air-filled
cavity is usually calculated for the adiabatic rather than the isothermal
condition.
To find an expression for the acoustic reactance of a compliant element,
we use the same reasoning as we did when finding the mechanical reactance
of a spring. We suppose that the element is in sinusoidal motion in response
to the sound pressure. The particle velocity at the surface of the element is
given by
Correspondingly, the volume velocity is
The particle displacement is
as given previously in Equations 7.3 and 7.4.
From the definition of acoustic compliance C it follows that the sound
pressure at the surface of the element is
But upS is the amplitude of the volume velocity, so that
The sound pressure is therefore a sinusoid whose amplitude is 1/coC times
that of the volume velocity and whose phase lags that of the volume velocity
by n/2. The acoustic impedance of the element is therefore a pure reactance
Xc which can be represented by the imaginary number
Acoustic Mass (Inertance)
The acoustic equivalent of mass or electrical inductance is called acoustic
mass or inertance. It is the ratio of sound pressure to the rate of change of

volume velocity (that is, volume acceleration). In other words, the acoustic
mass M of an element is given by
where a is the particle acceleration at the surface S of the element. To gain
some understanding of this concept, suppose that the spring in Figure 7.15
is replaced by a mass m so that the movement of the piston is now controlled
by forces due to inertia rather than elasticity (Figure 7.16). The force
required to produce an acceleration a is ma, and this force is equal to the
sound pressure acting over the area S. The pressure is therefore equal to
ma/S, so that
To find the acoustic reactance of the element, we again start with the
assumption that the element is in sinusoidal motion with velocity u and that
this is also the velocity of the sound particles at the surface. Proceeding as
before (Equations 7.3 and 7.5), we write the velocity and acceleration as
and
But upS is the amplitude Up of the volume velocity, so that
From the definition of acoustic mass (Equation 7.12), the sound pressure
is equal to MaS, so that
FIG. 7.16 Acoustic mass.

Impedance 253
We therefore see that the sound pressure is a sinusoid whose amplitude is
coM times that of the volume velocity and whose phase leads the velocity
by a quarter of a cycle. The acoustic impedance of the element is therefore
a pure reactance XM which can be represented by the imaginary number
Comparison of Acoustic and Mechanical Impedance
Mechanical impedance is the ratio of force to velocity, and acoustic
impedance is the ratio of sound pressure to volume velocity. Both forms of
impedance are helpful in solving problems concerning the production and
reception of sound by mechanical systems. The mass element described in
the previous section provides an example in which the driving force arising
from sound pressure at the surface is opposed by mechanical inertia. If we
substitute for M from Equation 7.13, we have
and
for the acoustic case
for the mechanical case
So we find that the acoustic impedance of the element is equal to its
mechanical impedance divided by the square of the surface area exposed to
the sound field; that is,
This relationship is true generally, not just for the mass impedance. The
squared term occurs because 5 is involved twice in the change from
mechanical impedance to acoustic impedanceâonce in the change from
force to pressure and again in the change from velocity to volume velocity.
For example, the acoustic impedance presented to incoming sound at the
eardrum is equal to the mechanical impedance of the middle ear divided by
the square of the effective area of the tympanic membrane.
The mechanical impedance of a dynamic system such as a loudspeaker is
made up of several components, including the interaction with the acoustic
environment. That part of the mechanical impedance that is due to sound
pressure is called the radiation impedance. It is equal to the acoustic
impedance at the radiating surface multiplied by the square of the surface
area.

254 Acoustics for Audiologists
Acoustic Compliance of an Air Volume
Suppose that air is trapped within a hard-walled container or cavity. We
will allow a small opening for the passage of sound. The cavity can have any
shape, but we stipulate that its dimensions in any direction must be small
compared with the wavelength of sound. As a consequence of this, the sound
pressure is the same at all points within the cavity. Seen through the
opening, the enclosed air behaves as an almost perfect spring whose
compliance is proportional to the contained volume. To calculate the
acoustic compliance of the air volume, we recall that compliance is defined
as the volume displacement brought about by the application of unit
pressure. In context this may at first seem rather puzzling because the
volume of the cavity is apparently constant, but it has to be understood that
the compliance is required in circumstances where the cavity is connected
to some other acoustic entity. The most readily visualized connection would
be with a vibrating piston whose movement would produce a small
oscillatory change in the enclosed volume. Alternatively, as in the Helmholtz
resonator described later in this chapter, the connection is with a moving
column of air that can be treated as a discrete element in much the same
way as a mechanical piston. In middle ear measurement (tympanometry),
the enclosure created by the external ear canal is similarly coupled to a
moving column of air contained in the pipe that connects the ear to the
sound source. The oscillatory changes in volume associated with such
connections are of course exceedingly small compared with the volume of
the cavity itself.
Referring to Figure 7.17, let V be the volume of air in the cavity and let
P be the barometric pressure. For an adiabatic compression, the bulk elastic

modulus K of a gas is yP, where y is the ratio of the principal specific heats
(approximately 1-40 for airâsee Chapter 1) and by definition
If the piston shown in the diagram moves to compress the air, the displaced
volume can be regarded as a decrease in the volume of the cavity. It is
accompanied by an increase in pressure. The ratio of the volume change to
the pressure change is the acoustic compliance C of the air in the cavity,
which is therefore given by
The velocity of sound is given by
where p0 is the density of air, so that we can write p0c2 in place of yP to
express the compliance in what are perhaps more familiar terms, namely,
The acoustic impedance of an air volume is therefore the pure elastic
reactance
A small air cavity of known volume is a useful laboratory standard for
calibrating impedance-measuring equipment, either in absolute units or
directly as an equivalent volume as explained in the next subsection.
Units of Measurement
Acoustic impedance and its componentsâacoustic resistance and acoustic
reactanceâhave dimensions of pressure divided by volume velocity. By
analogy with electrical impedance, the former CGS unit corresponding to
unit pressure divided by unit volume per second was called the acoustic ohm.
Although some clinical instruments for measuring the impedance of the ear
are calibrated in ohms, and much of the early data on middle aural
impedance were expressed in this way, the use of the acoustic ohm is now in
decline. The name MKS ohm can be used, but the standard MKS expression
is Pasm~3 or Nsm~5. This is the same as m~4kgs"1 in base units. An
acoustic impedance of 105 Nsm~ 5 is equal to 1 acoustic ohm (CGS).

256 Acoustics for Audiologists
Acoustic mass (inertance) can be expressed in Pas2m-3, Ns2m-5, or
kg-1m-4, and acoustic compliance has the units m3Pa-1, mN-1, or
kg-1 s2.
It is sometimes convenient to express acoustic impedance as an equivalent
air volume. The equivalent volume is that volume of an air-filled cavity that
has an impedance of the same magnitude as the actual impedance being
described. If the impedance has magnitude |Z|, then its equivalent air
volume Ve is given by
At 226 Hz, an air volume of 1 cc has an acoustic impedance of 1 x 108
Nsm-5. This is the same as 1 x 108 MKS acoustic ohms or 1 x 103 CGS
acoustic ohms.7
Equivalent air volume is used widely in diagnostic audiology. It is useful
for two reasons. The first is that the actual volume of a cavity is numerically
identical to its impedance expressed as an equivalent volume. So expressed,
the measured acoustic impedance of the external ear canal is the actual
volume of the ear canal. The second useful feature is that the equivalence
does not have to be restricted to acoustic impedance. It can apply, according
to context, to its reciprocal (acoustic admittance) or even to acoustic
compliance. Suppose a measurement X (of impedance, admittance, compli-
ance, etc.) is made on an ear and the result displayed as an equivalent air
volume. The same result would be recorded if the same measurement X were
made on a cavity whose actual volume was equal to the equivalent volume.
The Helmholtz Resonator
The Helmholtz resonator is a passive oscillator comprising the simplest of
acoustic elements, yet it can be finely tuned to provide a highly selective
frequency response. Although it has long been superseded as an analytical
tool, it provides a good illustration of the way in which some of the ideas
described in this chapter can be applied to systems comprising discrete
acoustic elements.
The resonator has a container of volume V with a small opening formed
by a short tube or neck (Figure 7.18). Allowing for 'end effects', the neck has
an effective length L and a cross-sectional area S. The dimensions of the tube
6Audiological instruments often indicate the reciprocal of impedance (admittance), and the
CGS unit, the mho, is still in use. At 226 Hz, an air volume of 1 cc has an admittance of
1 x 10-3 mho (1 mmho [millimho]).

and of the container are small compared with the wavelength of sound at
the resonance frequency, so that (a) wave transmission in the neck can be
ignored and (b) the sound pressure is practically uniform throughout the
container. With these conditions, the air in the neck can be considered to
oscillate as a single entity and we need only consider its mass. The contained
volume of air acts as a spring and we need only consider its elastic
behaviour. The mass of air in the neck is p0LS, and its acoustic inertance
M is this mass divided by S2; that is,
The acoustic compliance of the air volume is
The equivalent circuit of the resonator is the series arrangement shown in
the figure. The airflow in the neck is equal to the flow in and out of the main
vessel, and the pressure at the entrance to the neck is the sum of the acoustic
pressure in the vessel and the acoustic pressure derived from the inertia of
the air in the neck. The oscillator is damped by the resistance R, mainly

258 Acoustics for Audiologists
because it radiates sound from the open end of the neck. At the angular
frequency co, the inertance M has an acoustic impedance y'coM, and the
compliance C has an impedance âj/coC. Sound from the external field
arriving at the opening is presented with the combined impedance Z, where
so that
The impedance is the acoustic equivalent of the mechanical impedance in
the mass-spring-damper system described previously. It has the form
Z = R + jX, where R is the resistance and X (which is equal to coMâ 1/coC)
is the reactance. As with the mechanical system, we find that the impedance
is least at the frequency /0 for which the reactive part is zero. Resonance
therefore occurs at the angular frequency co0 for which ew0M = l/o>0C.
Remembering that a> = 2nf, we find that the resonance frequency is
Substituting for M and C gives
At resonance, the impedance as 'seen' from the external sound field is just
the acoustic resistance R which is due principally to radiation of sound from
the opening back into the field. Because, as stipulated, the diameter of the
opening is small compared with the wavelength of sound at the resonance
frequency, the resonator is a relatively feeble source. The resistance is small
and the velocity amplitude of the vibration in the neck is typically several
hundred times greater than it would be for the same acoustic pressure in a
free plane wave. As a consequence, the sound pressure in the cavity is much
greater than the pressure in the external field. To make practical use of the
resonator, it is necessary to have some means of detecting the sound within
it. One way is simply to listen to it through an ear tube attached to a small
opening in the cavity. The pressure magnification enhances the audibility of
weak sounds at the resonance frequency. It can be shown that the magnifi-
cation is equal to the ^-factor a)0M/R, which is typically7 between 50 and
80. The resonator therefore has excellent gain and frequency selectivity,
enabling sounds at the resonance frequency to be heard even in the presence
of competing sounds at other frequencies.

Acoustic Admittance
It has already been suggested that the behaviour of elements connected in
parallel is more easily described in terms of their admittance than their
impedance. A simple example will make this clear. The formula for calculat-
ing the combined resistance R of two resistors connected in parallel is
To obtain R we have to find the reciprocals of the component resistances,
add the results, and then calculate the reciprocal of this sum. If, on the other
hand, we are content to work with conductance G (the reciprocal of
resistance), then the corresponding formula for the combined conductance
of the two elements is simply
Although this may seem a rather trivial advantage when only arithmetical
operations are involved, it can lead to a useful simplification when dealing
with complex numbers. Audiologists will be aware that middle ear measure-
ments almost invariably involve admittance. As explained earlier, clinical
measurements are made at low frequencies such that the sound pressure is
virtually constant throughout the external ear canal and equal to the sound
pressure at the eardrum. The volume velocity at the entrance to the ear
canal is the sum of the velocity due to the elastic compliance of the air in
the canal and the velocity due to the response of the eardrum. The ear canal
and the middle ear are therefore acoustically in parallel even though the
anatomical layout suggests a series arrangement.
Acoustic admittance is defined as the ratio of volume velocity to sound
pressure. It can be treated in exactly the same way as impedance, using
complex numbers to represent the in-phase and quadrature components.
The real part G of the admittance is called acoustic conductance, and the
imaginary part Â±jB is called acoustic susceptance.8 These ideas are ex-
pressed formally as follows:
8These terms are not often used except in the audiological context, and they are not mentioned
in standard texts and glossaries. IEC 1027 (1991), Instruments for the measurement of aural
acoustic impedance/admittance, defines acoustic conductance and acoustic susceptance as,
respectively, the real and imaginary component of the complex acoustic admittance.

Notice here that if +j is required in the specification of impedance, âj is
required in the specification of admittance, that is, if Z = R + jX then
Y=G -jB. Conversely, if Z = R -jX then 7= G +jB.
To explore the relationship between acoustic impedance and admittance,
imagine that a particular arrangement has an impedance Z and an
admittance Y where, by definition, Y = 1/Z. Suppose for the sake of
argument that the volume velocity has amplitude C7p and the sinusoidal
variation
The corresponding sound pressure is then
Taking </> to be positive, we interpret this result as showing that the pressure

arbitrary, however, and we could equally well have stipulated that

corresponding volume velocity to be
showing that the velocity lags the pressure by </> radians? This is exactly the
same as saying that the pressure leads the velocity by the same angle. The
point being made here is that the phase relationships for impedance and
admittance are complementary: a pure mass element has reactance + jcoM
and susceptance âj/wM; a purely elastic element has reactance âj/caC and
susceptance +ja>C. Figure 7.19 provides further illustration.
When examining data from different sources, it may be necessary to
compare resistance and reactance with conductance and susceptance. If an
acoustic impedance is a pure resistance R, then the corresponding admit-

tance is 1/R; if it is a pure reactance X, the admittance is 1/X. In all other
cases the relationship is slightly less simple, and the following formulae
should be applied. Their derivation is given in Appendix A.

Clinical Measurement of Acoustic Admittance:
Tympanometry
Measurement of the acoustic admittance of the ear is a well-established part
of clinical practice. Measurement is, however, far from easy except when it
is done at low frequencies; the clinician has usually to be content with results
obtained at 226 Hz, or occasionally 660 Hz. Although measurements are of
necessity made through the external ear, the object of interest is usually the
middle ear. The only middle ear structure that is normally accessible is, of
course, the tympanic membrane, and measurement of admittance of the
middle ear is therefore measurement at the membrane, that is, tympa-
nometry. The development of methods for this kind of measurement has a
long history, and in the past it was usual to present the results as impedance
rather than admittance. The equipment was called an impedance meter or
impedance 'bridge' (by analogy with equipment used by electrical engineers).
Not unreasonably, impedance has persisted as a generic term in middle ear
measurement, although other names have been introduced.9 The word
tympanometry has also come to denote a class of measurements rather than
a single specific one. It generally signifies the measurement of aural acoustic
impedance or admittance, or the measurement of some related quantity such
as acoustic compliance, as a function of the static pressure in the external
ear. The graphical representation of the result is called a tympanogram. A
qualifier can be added to create names such as impedance tympanogram,
admittance tympanogram, susceptance tympanogram, and so on, but unless
otherwise stated, we shall assume that the measured quantity is acoustic
admittance.
The physical principles underlying tympanometry are as follows. The
measuring equipment has a small probe that is inserted into the external ear
canal. A soft rubber plug is used to make an airtight seal (Figure 7.20).
Three fine-bore tubes pass through the plug to connect the ear to a
microphone, a sound source (miniature earphone), and a pneumatic system
that controls the static pressure in the ear canal. Although in the measure-
ment process the volume velocity in the ear canal is not constant, the sound
source can be described as a 'constant velocity source'. What this means is
that the impedance of the source is relatively high, making it the dominant
factor in determining the flow at the entrance to the ear canal. If, then, the
amplitude of the voltage across the terminals of the source is held constant,
the amplitude of the volume velocity in the sound entering the ear is
virtually unaffected by any change in the ear's impedance. Within design
9Immittance has been suggested as a catch-all, but the term is deprecated (IEC 60050-801).

limits, a given voltage produces the same volume velocity regardless of the
impedance of the ear or cavity to which the probe is fitted.
The volume velocity U at the entrance to the ear canal is therefore
proportional to, and in phase with, the voltage at the source, or at least at
some suitably chosen reference point in the circuit supplying the source.
Similarly, a voltage derived from the output of the microphone is propor-
tional to the sound pressure and in phase with it, and this voltage is used
to supply a control circuit that adjusts the output of the earphone so as to
keep the sound pressure p constant. By definition, the admittance Y at the
probe is equal to U/p, so that if p is constant then U is proportional to Y.
This means that the voltage at the earphone is also proportional to Y. Call
this voltage Vv. If only the magnitude | Y\ of the admittance is required, all
that is necessary is to rectify and average Vu and provide a display
proportional to the average. The displayed output can then be made to
show admittance directly after calibration with a standard cavity. If,

264 Acoustics for Audiologists
however, the components G and B are required, some simple processing is
needed. One method is as follows.
Let the sound pressure have the sinusoidal variation p = p0 sin ait.
The volume velocity then has two components, one proportional to G sin cot
and the other proportional to B sin(cot Â± n/2). The latter is more conveni-
ently written as Â±B cos cot. If the voltage Vu representing the volume
velocity is multiplied by a voltage Fp representing the sound pressure (the
voltage derived from the output of the microphone), the product will
contain two terms, one proportional to G sin2 cot and the other propor-
tional to B cos cot sin cot. The average value of sin2 cot taken over a whole
number of cycles is i, whereas the average of cos cot sin cot is zero. Averag-
ing the product of the source and microphone voltages therefore gives
a result proportional to the acoustic conductance. To obtain the suscep-
tance, all that is needed is to advance the phase of the pressure-dependant
voltage by one quarter of a cycle. This is easily done using a phase-shift
circuit. Multiplication by Vu will then give terms proportional to B cos2 cot
and G sin cot cos cot so that it is now the susceptance that remains after
averaging.
As already stated, the ear canal can be treated as a 'discrete' acoustic
element in parallel with the middle ear (Figure 7.21). If 7C and Yd are
respectively the acoustic admittances of the ear canal and the eardrum (at
FIG. 7.21 The ear canal and middle ear as discrete acoustic elements.

Impedance 265
the tympanic membrane), then the admittance presented to the probe is Y
such that
In tympanometry the static pressure in the external ear canal is changed
progressively, usually from +200 daPa to â200 daPa or less, relative to the
ambient atmospheric pressure. The pressure change is usually accompanied
by a small change in 1Yc. 
and a very much greater change in Yd. The change
in canal admittance is usually negligible. It is caused by small changes in
canal volume and changes in the density of the air. The admittance at the
tympanic membrane is normally greatest when the pressure of the air in the
external ear is equal to the pressure of the air in the middle ear space. If a
pressure difference exists, the tympanic membrane is either forced inwards
or drawn out, depending on whether the external ear pressure is greater or
less than the middle ear pressure. The corresponding reduction in eardrum
admittance is probably caused by an increase in the stiffness of the
membrane, but the acoustic consequences for the middle ear are unknown
except that the overall result is generally a slight impairment of the sound
transmission. It is usually found that both the susceptance and the conduc-
tance of the tympanic membrane are lower when the membrane is stressed.
The result is that admittance and its components are all likely to have a
maximum value when the pressures on the membrane are balanced. The
location of this point on the pressure scale of a tympanogram is therefore a
diagnostically useful indication of middle ear pressure (Figure 7.22).
The shape of a tympanogram can give useful diagnostic information. The
simplest and most widely used interpretation is based on two crude but
acceptable assumptions. These are that the low-frequency admittance of a
normal middle ear is practically that of a pure compliance (Figure 7.14) and
that the external ear is acoustically nothing more than an air-filled volume
that also behaves as a pure compliance. The middle and external ears are
acoustically in parallel and their admittances are directly additive. Because
each has the same phase, the addition can be made arithmetically. All that
is necessary is to subtract the admittance at a pressure of, say, + 200 daPa
from peak admittance (at middle ear pressure). The result is the admittance
at the eardrum. It will usually be expressed as an 'admittance' or a
'compliance' in equivalent volume units. An abnormally low or high
admittance or the absence of a peak in the tympanogram is an indication
of middle ear pathology (Table 7.1).
A more refined analysis is possible if the components of the admittance
are available separately. The measured admittance at +200 daPa is,
hypothetically, the admittance of the external ear canal itself on the
assumption that the application of a static pressure makes the admittance

at the tympanum negligible. The admittance of the ear canal is then
If the ear canal between the probe and the tympanic membrane behaves as
the simple compliance of an air volume V, we expect the conductance Gc to
be negligible and the susceptance Bc to be equal to coF/p0c2. This, then, is
the susceptance measured at +200 daPa or at some other static pressure
for which the eardrum admittance is effectively zero. Measurements at any
other pressure then yield the admittance Yd at the eardrum once the canal
susceptance has been subtracted:
so that the magnitude of the eardrum admittance is

Tympanograms are described as uncompensated if no such allowance has
been made.
The assumption has been that the measured conductance Gc at the probe
is negligible when the tympanic membrane is sufficiently stressed by a static
pressure. If Gc is not negligible, then either the ear canal is not behaving as
a simple cavity (a pure compliance) or the residual conductance of the
middle ear is significant. The results are then difficult to interpret.
Distributed Acoustic Impedance
When the wavelength of sound is not so long that elements can be treated
as discrete, the essential wave nature of sound has to be recognized when
considering its transmission in confining systems. As previously stated, the
treatment of radio-frequency electric currents in transmission lines provides
a direct analogy. The physics is considerably more challenging than for the
discrete systems, and only some very general ideas will be presented here.
The relevance for audiology is that even though formal analysis is rarely
attempted, it is necessary to be aware of the wave nature of sound when
considering its transmission in the external ear and in hearing aid compo-
nents at frequencies above about 2 kHz.
Suppose sound is transmitted in a circular pipe whose cross-sectional area
is S. This area is numerically equal to the volume of unit length of the pipe
so that, by Equations 7.13 and 7.14, the inertance ML and compliance CL
per unit length of the pipe are given by
and
Unless the pipe has a very small diameter, the acoustic resistance (per unit
length) associated with viscosity and heat exchange through the walls is
negligible. Nevertheless, some losses must occur in transmission, so that if
the pipe is very long only the transmitted wave will be observed, any wave
reflected from the far end having died out. It can be shown that in these
circumstances the acoustic impedance at any cross section of the pipe is
given by

Impedance 269
This is simply the characteristic impedance divided by the area of the pipe.
The pipe therefore behaves as a perfect acoustic resistance, and the ratio of
sound pressure to particle velocity is the same as that found in a plane
progressive wave. This result is to be expected because, by definition, a plane
wave is not divergent and the confinement offered by an open pipe running
perpendicular to the wavefront has no influence on the motion of the air
except at the boundaries (assuming the wall of the pipe to be extremely
thin). Boundary effects have been discounted because viscosity and heat
exchange have been assumed to be negligible.
Suppose, however, that the pipe has a finite length and sound is intro-
duced at one end. Let the other end of the pipe be terminated by some
impedance that differs from the characteristic impedance. Sound will be
reflected at the termination, and interference will occur between the incident
and reflected waves. The impedance of the pipe will then vary from one
place to another along the pipe. It will depend on the length of the pipe, the
frequency of the sound, and the nature of the terminating impedance. A
general treatment will not be attempted here, but one special case will be
mentioned. This is where the pipe is closed by a solid cap so that the
terminating impedance is infinite. The impedance Z0 at the open end of the
pipe is then found to be
where / is the length of the pipe and k = 2n/L The cotangent (cot kl) is
defined as I/tan kl; that is,
We see, therefore, that the impedance varies between +j x oo and âj x oo
depending on the wavelength and the length of the pipe (Figure 7.23). The
pipe therefore presents a pure reactance, either of the mass type or the elastic
type. For certain wavelengths, the reactance is zero and the corresponding
frequencies are the resonance frequencies for the closed pipe. They occur
when cos kl is zero, that is, when kl is an odd multiple of n/2. Accordingly,
where n = 1, 2, 3,... for resonance. But / = ck/2n, so that the resonance
frequencies are the series of odd harmonics

Acoustic Impedance of the Human Ear
A knowledge of the impedance of the ear is important in the specification
and evaluation of the performance of audiometric earphones and hearing
aids. Ear simulators have been developed that present an earphone or
hearing aid with the same acoustic load as the average human ear and which
produce a sound pressure at the microphone corresponding to that at the
tympanic membrane. Further information about ear simulators can be
found in Chapter 8.
Audiometric Earphones
Figure 7.24 shows the magnitude and phase of the acoustic impedance of
the ear as viewed through the aperture of an earcap (earphone cushion). The
data are taken from the international standard10 specifying the perfomance
of an artificial ear to be used for calibrating supra-aural earphones. The

equivalent electrical circuit has four parallel branches. The first of these is a
high resistance (not less than 5 kQ) to represent the acoustic effect of a small
leak needed to remove any excess static pressure at the microphone. The
second branch represents the volume of air between the ear cushion and the
pinna. The third branch influences the observed impedance below about 500
Hz. Its effect is to reduce the acoustic reactance at low frequencies. The
physiological basis for the low reactance observed in real ears is not known
for certain, but the phenomenon remains even when the meatus is plugged.

272 Acoustics for Audiologists
The compliance of the pinna may be a factor because the reactance depends
on the force between the earcap and the ear. The fourth branch represents
the influence of the ear canal and middle ear. The impedance simulated by
this branch is not needed if the ear canal is blocked.
Hearing Aids
Hearing aids are usually coupled to the ear by an earmould which occupies
about half the length of the ear canal. The distance between the tip of the
earmould and the tympanic membrane is then about 14 mm. The acoustic
impedance of this short part of the ear canal, together with the termination
provided by the middle ear, has an important influence on the performance
of hearing aids. Most hearing aid earphones behave as high-impedance
sources insofar as the deflection of the diaphragm is virtually unaffected by
the acoustic load normally encountered. This means that the sound pressure
at the tip of the earmould will be proportional to the acoustic impedance
presented to it. At any given frequency the sound pressure at the tympanic
membrane is proportional to the sound pressure at the earmould, so it is
desirable that the impedance of the ear is correctly replicated. An appropri-
ate acoustic load is provided by the standard occluded-ear simulator.11
The impedance of the simulator, which is close to that of the average
human ear (suitably occluded) is illustrated in a simplified way in Figure
7.25. Impedance is represented as if measured at a reference plane in the ear
canal, 14 mm from the tympanic membrane. The salient features are as
follows:
(A) The impedance is that of the air volume between the earmould and
the tympanic membrane, together with the stiffness-controlled imped-
ance of the eardrum (as described earlier concerning tympanometry).
(B) In this region the reactive part of the eardrum impedance changes
from stiffness controlled to mass controlled, with a middle ear
resonance at about 1300 Hz.
(C) Here, and at higher frequencies, the impedance at the reference plane
is virtually independent of the middle ear. It is the impedance of a
closed tube.
(D) The minimum at about 7 kHz is produced by resonance in which the
length of the ear canal is a quarter of a wavelength. There is a velocity
node at the eardrum and a velocity antinode at the end of the
earmould (reference plane). The velocity is maintained by the output

Kjaer.)
from the hearing aid. There is a pressure antinode at the eardrum and
a pressure node at the earmould. The low sound pressure and high
velocity at the earmould produce a low impedance at this point.
(E) The maximum at about 14 kHz (a frequency above the normal
working range) corresponds to resonance in which the length of the
ear canal is half a wavelength. There are velocity nodes at the
eardrum and at the end of the earmould. There are corresponding
pressure antinodes at these points so that the sound pressure is high
at the earmould. The high pressure and low velocity give a high
impedance at this point.

The Calibration and Testing of
Audiometric Equipment
It is generally thought self-evident that audiometric equipment needs regular
inspection to ensure that its performance meets the manufacturer's specifi-
cations and the demands of the appropriate national or international
standards. Performance specifications exist to guide design and to inform
the user. They do not constitute a list of items to be checked on each
occasion. Even for basic equipment, such as a two-channel audiometer, the
number of laboratory tests needed to ensure complete compliance with the
specifications in all modes of operation would be impossibly large and it has
to be assumed that the manufacturer's work has been done correctly. This
raises questions as to what aspects of performance need to be checked and
how often such checks should be made. The answers depend on the
likelihood and consequences of equipment malfunction and on the resources
available for inspection. An audiometer that is used for research involving
the precise measurement of hearing thresholds would need more frequent
inspection than one used in a community screening programme. For
audiometers in general clinical use, it is usually thought appropriate to make
a daily inspection of the external wiring and mechanical parts, to listen at
least daily for evidence of gross malfunction, and to arrange an annual
laboratory test of the signal output level and frequency. Other features of
performance may be tested at longer intervals.1 This three-tier approach is
arbitrary in the sense that it is not based on a statistical appraisal of
malfunction and its consequences, but it is the kind of approach in lieu of
genuine risk analysis that is often applied elsewhere. In the United King-
dom, for example, all motor vehicles more than 3 years old are required to
undergo an annual Ministry of Transport inspection. As a consequence,
acoustic laboratories and garages are guaranteed a steady supply of work,
though whether auditory diagnosis or road accident statistics are signifi-
cantly improved remains a moot point. In favour of the annual event, it can
be said that the duration of any discoverable fault will not exceed 12
months.
Subjective stage A checks (daily checks) are listed in ISO 8253-1. This standard also lists
laboratory checks (stage B) and refers to basic calibration (stage C).

280 Acoustics for Audiologists
The observations made in this chapter are intended to be general so that
they apply in part to various kinds of audiological equipment, including
tympanometers, speech equipment, and equipment used for evoked poten-
tials, as well as audiometers. We shall, however, start with pure tone
audiometers.
A distinction may be made between inspection or testing and calibration.
A test for the absence of distortion is not calibration; adjustment of the
output level of a tone or the sweep speed of a timebase is. The chief purpose
of audiometer calibration is to ensure that signals are generated with the
correct frequency and hearing level. Calibration is therefore the practical
realization of the hearing level scale, and although this may seem a perfectly
straightforward physical measurement, there are underlying difficulties
which even now have not been fully resolved. We shall defer consideration
of these until the end of this chapter and describe first the methods for
calibrating pure tone audiometers.
It should be remembered that the hearing level scale for pure tones is a
universal scale and thus a pure tone audiometer should deliver the same
stimulus regardless of where it was calibrated. The standardization that
makes this possible is coordinated by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC). Most national standards for audiometer calibration are now identical
in all material respects to those published by the ISO and IEC. The
performance of pure tone audiometers is covered in IEC 60645-1. The
standard gives considerable detail that is not included in this chapter.
Readers who intend calibrating their own equipment should consult the
standard or its national equivalent. It will be found that standards usually
contain numerous references to other standards. Unfortunately, this leads to
something of a paper chase for anyone attempting faithful adherence to the
prescribed methods for audiometer calibration and testing. A list of relevant
international standards is included at the end of this chapter (Table 8.6).
Pure Tones: Frequency, Sound Level,
and Force Level
To measure the sound output of an earphone, it is necessary to connect it
acoustically to a microphone. This is done using a standard acoustic coupler
or ear simulator. Most audiometers have supra-aural2 earphones, for which
2 A supra-aural earphone is one that rests against the pinna, as distinct from a circumaural
earphone, which encloses it. An insert earphone is one that fits directly into the external ear
canal.

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 281
there are currently two forms of coupler. The simplest of these, described in
IEC 60318-3, is little more than a cylindrical cavity having a volume of
approximately 6 cc. It is identical to the American NBS (National Bureau
of Standards) type 9A coupler. This coupler now is used only to calibrate
audiometers fitted with Telephonies TDH-39 or Beyer DT-48 earphones.
Audiometers having any other type of supra-aural earphone should be
calibrated using an IEC 60318-1 ear simulator. The latter is also called an
artificial ear; it replicates the acoustic load presented to the earphone (see
Chapter 7). The sound pressure at the microphone of the artificial ear is the
pressure that would appear at the entrance to the ear canal of an 'average'
human ear. Ear simulators and couplers are illustrated in Figure 8.1.
Audiometers for paediatric work are sometimes fitted with insert earphones.
They may be calibrated using hearing aid couplers, namely, the 2-cc coupler
(IEC 60126) or the occluded-ear simulator (IEC 60711). The 2-cc coupler is
merely a cylindrical cavity, but the occluded ear simulator presents the
impedance of the occluded ear, and its microphone records a pressure
equivalent to that at the tympanic membrane.
When calibrating an audiometer for bone conduction audiometry, a
mechanical coupler is needed to connect the vibrator to a force transducer.
Currently, only one mechanical coupler is specified (IEC 60373). It presents
the vibrator with approximately the same mechanical impedance as that
measured at the mastoid of the average human head. The transducer records
the vibratory force that would be generated at the contact between the
vibrator and the real human mastoid. The device is often called an artificial
mastoid (Figure 8.1e).
Standards in the ISO 389 series give values of the sound pressure level to
be obtained in the appropriate coupling device when the audiometer is
operated at 0 dB HL. Collectively, these levels are called the reference
equivalent threshold sound pressure levels (RETSPL). The corresponding
force levels for bone conduction measurements are called reference equival-
ent threshold force levels (RETFL). The word reference implies that the
values relate to a standard to which the calibration is referred; the word
equivalent means that the output of the transducer at the reference level is
the same as the output it would have at the normal threshold of hearing.
Notice that the concept of 'normal hearing' is embodied in the definition of
the reference levels. We shall return to this in the discussion at the end of
the chapter. The reference levels are given in basic physical units: for sound
pressures they are in decibels relative to 20 ,uPa; for force levels they are in
decibels relative to 1 uN. They depend on frequency and, in some cases, on
the particular combination of earphone and coupler that is employed.
Examples are given in Table 8.1. The practical significance of the reference
levels is this: if the audiometer is set to produce a tone at N dB HL, then

its output measured with an appropriate acoustic or mechanical coupler
should be N + R decibels, where R is the specified reference level at the
operating frequency. Calibration ensures that this requirement is fulfilled
within a specified tolerance.
An example of equipment set up for audiometer calibration is shown in
Figure 8.2. Some or all of this equipment is needed depending on the extent
of the work to be undertaken. Essential components comprise the couplers,
the sound-level meter, and the frequency meter. A good-quality sound-level
meter is required. It should be a type 0 or type 1 as described in the previous
chapter. A set of filters (preferably third-octave) or a spectrum analyser is
needed to measure harmonic distortion and to measure the characteristics
of masking noise. The oscilloscope provides a direct visual indication of
distortion and any contamination of the signal by environmental and
instrument noise. Ancillary equipment includes a pistonphone or other form
of acoustic calibrator and a reference alternating-voltage source (or an
oscillator and a voltmeter) to set the voltage sensitivity of the sound-level

meter when it is used with a direct electrical input. The direct input is needed
for bone conduction calibration. It replaces the input from the microphone.
Couplers or artificial ears nearly always have condenser microphones, so
that a microphone preamplifier is essential. The preamplifier may be part of
the sound-level meter itself, in which case the acoustic coupler has to be
connected directly to it. The mechanical coupler can be used without a
preamplifier or conditioning amplifier (charge amplifier), but it is then
important to take particular care to minimise the capacitance in the cable
that connects it to the sound-level meter. A suitable cable can be obtained
from the manufacturer.

290 Acoustics for Audiologists
Practical Considerations
Audiometers are usually more reliable and more stable than their users
believe. The most common sources of error are faulty connectors and
damaged headphone cables; mechanical switches are also prone to failure.
Battery-operated audiometers are usually received for calibration in want of
a recharge or a new battery. Portable audiometers are seldom strong
enough to withstand user abuse, but their earphones are surprisingly
resistant to maltreatment. Bone vibrators have a bad reputation, but it is
probably not deserved. Calibration should always be preceded by a thor-
ough mechanical and electrical inspection, after which any significant faults
should be dealt with. At this time it is also worth checking serial numbers to
ensure that the audiometer has been sent with the correct transducers. Users
often, and perhaps unknowingly, interchange headsets between audiometers.
Audiometric earphones and bone vibrators are usually of the moving-coil
variety, so that the sound pressure or vibratory force that they generate
depends on the current in the coil. The current is equal to the open-circuit
output voltage of the audiometer divided by the combined impedance of the
transducer, its leads and connectors, and the source impedance of the
audiometer. The impedance of the leads and connectors is the most variable
of these elements, and particular care should be taken to confirm the
integrity of the wiring to the transducers to ensure that connectors make
good electrical contact and to check that connecting screws (particularly
those in the earphone) are tight.
Electrical safety should also be tested.3 It may be observed in passing that
there may be mechanical as well as electrical hazards. The coupling between
the headband and the earphone or bone vibrator is often barely strong
enough; in particular, the rivets that secure the stirrups are likely to fail at
some time. The greatest mechanical stress occurs when the headband is
expanded at the moment of fitting it to the patient, when failure could cause
injury to the head of face or, more seriously, to an eye. For this reason it is
good practice in audiometry to fit the headband from behind the patient's
head, and it is good practice to examine headbands frequently for mechan-
ical defects.
Calibration is best undertaken in a quiet room; otherwise, the signal from
the audiometer can only be examined when it is at a high level. The
workbench has to be reasonably vibration free. It may be helpful to place
the artificial ear on an antivibration table. A suitable table can easily be
made from a heavy block of material mounted on some soft springs; a
3National guidelines apply, for example, the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) DB9801 in the
United Kingdom. The international safety specification is IEC 60601-1.

simulator.
paving stone placed on the softly inflated inner tube of a tyre from a motor
scooter is an excellent alternative. Vibration from the workbench is seldom
a problem for bone conduction calibration because the mechanical coupler
is itself quite massive (4.3 kg) and is supplied ready-mounted on soft springs.
It is necessary to apply the earphone to the coupler or artificial ear
centrally and with the prescribed force, namely, 4.5 Â± 0.5 N not including
the weight of the earphone itself.4 The manufacturer may supply a suitable
loading device, but a 460-gm weight placed on top of the earphone is an
adequate alternative. A more elaborate arrangement that ensures correct
alignment5 and provides the required weight is shown in Figure 8.3. Before
placing an earphone on the coupler, care should be taken to see that it is
free of debris that could fall on the diaphragm of the microphone. Consider-
4The phrase 'not including the weight of the earphone' is a curious anomaly that has been
reproduced in many versions of the standards. It implies that the weight of the earphone is
an additional force between the earphone and the coupler, but a similar requirement is not
found in the specification for calibrating bone vibrators. The specified nominal force between
the earphone and the pinna is also 4.5 N. This does not involve the weight of the earphone
because the headband force is directed horizontally.

292 Acoustics for Audiologists
ation should be given to obtaining a good acoustic seal between the
earphone and the coupler; otherwise, there is a likelihood of significant
error, particular at low frequencies. Similar considerations apply to bone
vibrators, except that the alignment of the vibrator and the mechanical
coupler is less critical. A deadweight is probably more convenient than the
loading spring provided by the manufacturer6 (Figure 8.1e). The required
weight is 550 gm (5.4 + 0.5 N).
Although the reference equivalent levels specify the output of the
audiometer when it is operated at 0 dB HL, it is not normal practice to
calibrate directly at this level because the acoustic signal would be too weak
to measure easily. Manufacturers may suggest levels at which calibration
should be made (the levels are displayed on some audiometers when they
are operated in the 'calibration mode'). So long as the signal level is well
above that of the environmental and instrument noise level it is not critical.
Somewhere in the middle of the available hearing level range, perhaps
60 dB HL, seems sensible. The signal level should be recorded because later,
when the signal attenuator is checked, attenuator error will be zero at this
level. Because bone vibrators are prone to distortion, it is usual to calibrate
the bone conduction output at more modest levels, for example, 20 dB HL
at 250 Hz, and 40 dB HL at higher frequencies.
It is good practice to record the output of the audiometer at all
frequencies, for both air and bone conduction, before making adjustments.
This is a somewhat tedious process, and computer assistance in acquiring
and storing the information is helpful. The preadjustment record is import-
ant because any errors that may have affected the outcome of audiometric
tests will remain traceable. Adjustment should then follow if permitted
tolerances are exceeded. The signal level should be accurate to + 3 dB in the
frequency range 125 to 4000 Hz and Â±5 dB at 6000 and 8000 Hz (IEC
60645-1). Frequencies have a tolerance of between 1% and 3% according to
the type of audiometer.7 It should be remembered that these tolerances are
the maximum allowed according to the standard. Most laboratories would
impose stricter limits. The guiding principle is that errors in calibration
should have a negligible influence on the outcome of audiometry. A 5-dB
error is not negligible (though its effect on diagnosis probably is), but a 1-dB
error would be undetectable in a clinical setting.
6At present the principal manufacturer is Bruel & Kjaer Ltd. Their type 4930 artificial mastoid
has a loading arm that holds the vibrator in place by means of a spring. A simple and effective
modification is to remove the spring and to attach a weight to the arm at a point just above
the vibrator. The weight should be 5-4 N. (A small deduction can be made for the weight of
the vibrator itself and the load on the vibrator due to the weight of the arm.)
7The types are designated 1 to 5 in IEC 60645-1. Types 1 and 2 require a frequency accuracy
of 1% and 2%, respectively; for types 3 to 5, the accuracy is 3%.

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 293
Although ambient conditions (temperature, pressure, and humidity) have
little effect on earphone calibration, the performance of the mechanical
coupler is significantly dependent on temperature. The standard tempera-
ture for calibration is 23 Â± 1Â°C. Unless the temperature is controlled, it is
often likely to lie outside this range. Corrections for temperature changes
are difficult to make because the mechanical impedance of the coupler as
well as its force sensitivity are affected and the overall effect depends on the
mechanical impedance of the bone vibrator. With the B71 vibrator, changes
in the hearing level calibration exceeding 0-5 dB/Â°C can be expected at some
frequencies.8 It is therefore necessary to control the temperature or to accept
that some error is inevitable.
Little has been said so far about measuring frequencies. This is seldom
a difficult task because it is easily accomplished with the kind of fre-
quency meter that is standard equipment in any electronics workshop. Care
should be taken to see that the signal delivered to the frequency meter is
noise free and of an adequate level. If there is any doubt, it is worth checking
that the frequency read-out remains unchanged when the signal level is
altered.
Equipment Fitted with Insert Earphones
Insert earphones have received relatively little attention as a standard source
for audiometry. They do, however, offer some valuable advantages over
supra-aural earphones in at least two applications, namely, as a source of
masking noise generally and as a source of pure tones for hearing tests on
small children. The advantage for masking is that the listener's head is
unencumbered by the headband that would otherwise be needed to support
one (or often both) external earphones; the advantage when testing children
is again that no headband is needed, with the result that the child is likely
to be more comfortable and more cooperative. For a given electrical supply,
the sound pressure created in the ear canal by an insert phone depends to
a significant extent on the depth of insertion and on the size of the ear canal
itself. It is probable that this leads to a more variable stimulus than would
be obtained with conventional earphones. In principle, it would be possible
to define the threshold of hearing in terms of the sound pressure that is
actually present in the ear canal. Such a definition would then apply equally
in other contexts, such as tympanometry and other measurements where the
sound source is coupled to the ear by a probe. In tympanometry, the level

mechanical coupler systems. B. J. Audiol 26: 275-281, 1992.

294 Acoustics for Audiologists
of the probe tone is often controlled so that the sound pressure in the
ear canal is the same regardless of the canal volume; in otoacoustic
emissions work, it is usual to monitor the sound pressure in the ear
canal and to modify the electrical supply to the earphone to obtain the
requisite stimulus level. It is also the case that real-ear measurements are
frequently used to assess hearing aid performance, and for some digital
hearing aids, fitting involves the measurement of hearing thresholds with
the aid itself acting as the source of the stimulating tone. However,
formal audiometry seldom, if ever, relies on direct sound measurement in
the ear canal. There is, moreover, no reference standard that specifies the
real-ear sound pressure for audiometry; instead, the usual procedure of
referencing to an equivalent threshold sound pressure in a coupling device
is adopted.
Reference equivalent thresholds have so far been established for only one
insert earphone, the Etymotic Research ER-3A, coupled to the ear by inserts
of type ER-3-14 (Table 8.2). This earphone is acoustically identical to the
Eartone 3A. The inserts may have the name Earlink 3A. The methods for
attaching the earphone to the standard 2-cc coupler (IEC 60126) or
occluded-ear simulator (IEC 60711) and the corresponding reference equiv-
alent thresholds are described in ISO 389-2. The earphone is normally
coupled to the ear by a flexible sound tube having a length of 240 mm and
an internal diameter of 2 mm. The sound tube ends in a small plastic

tip is normally inserted so that its outer end is 2 to 3 mm inside the entrance
to the ear canal. For calibration, the tip is removed and the sound tube from
the earphone is connected to the coupler or artificial ear by means of a
plastic tube to make the outlet of the connector flush with the inlet nipple
of the coupler. The total length of pipework, including the plastic connector,
between the exit of the earphone and the entrance of the coupler is then 251
mm (Figure 8.4).

296 Acoustics for Audiologists
Signal Attenuator
Over much of its range, the signal from the audiometer is controlled by an
attenuator whose output is connected directly to the earphone or bone
vibrator. The level may also be controlled in part by changing the signal at
the input to the attenuator, for example, by introducing additional amplifi-
cation to extend the range to higher hearing levels. The comments that
follow apply regardless of the way in which the change in output is
accomplished, and for simplicity we shall use the word attenuator to denote
the controlling mechanism. Attenuators work by switching the output
connections between different points in a chain of resistors. The switching
may be done mechanically or electrically. Mechanical switches are inher-
ently noise free, at least when new, because they have no active components,
but the switch contacts are likely to deteriorate and may eventually become
unreliable. Nowadays most audiometers have electronic attenuators. A
properly designed attenuator provides the audiometer with the same output
impedance at all hearing levels. The impedance is generally low compared
with that of the earphone or vibrator at the operating frequency, so that the
audiometer behaves, at least approximately, as a 'voltage source'. Neverthe-
less, if the transducer is replaced by a simple electrical load (for test
purposes), care should be taken to see that its impedance is approximately
the same as that of the transducer.
The IEC standard specifies the accuracy of the output control in the
following way:
The measured difference in output between two successive indications
of hearing level which are not more than 5 dB apart shall not differ from
the indicated difference on the indicator by more than three-tenths of the
indicated interval measured in decibels or by more than 1 dB, whichever is the
smaller.
It should also be remembered that, overall, the output of the audiometer
must always lie within the Â± 3 or + 5 dB tolerance mentioned previously.
Any systematic error in the attenuator must therefore be such that the
cumulative error does not take the output beyond these limits even if cali-
bration at the nominated calibration point (e.g., 60 dB HL) is satisfactory.
Practical Considerations
Ideally, attenuators should be tested by examining the acoustic or vibratory
output from the transducer. The difficulty is that environmental and

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 297
instrument noise may preclude measurement at low signal levels. In practice
it is best to supplement acoustic measurements with measurements of the
voltage developed across a dummy load. A 10-Q resistor is a satisfactory
substitute for most earphones, but for some a higher value is needed. It is
generally considered adequate to test the attenuator for only one mode of
output and only one frequency. Usually this will be for air conduction at
1 kHz. A case can be made, however, for testing the output in the bone
conduction mode at least once during the lifetime of the audiometer.
Earphones have approximately the same impedance at all frequencies, but
the load presented by a bone vibrator is likely to be small at low frequencies
and large at high frequencies (typically 4-5 fi at 250 Hz and 25 Q at 4000
Hz). Some attenuators whose performance is irreproachable in air conduc-
tion are found wanting when bone conduction is selected, particularly if the
frequency is low.
When testing the attenuator, it is essential to maintain a good
signal-to-noise ratio at all indicated hearing levels. There are several ways
of doing this. An obvious ploy is to choose a frequency for which the
reference equivalent pressure or force level is relatively high. This leads
to a correspondingly high sound pressure or force level for a given hear-
ing level. It is particularly successful for bone conduction measurements
at low frequencies (250 or 500 Hz). Another method is to work at
frequencies where environmental noise is least troublesome. A third-octave
or narrow-band filter is distinctly helpful and, for measurements at 1 kHz,
A-weighting may be added for good measure. It is also possible to take
advantage of the fact that the output of the audiometer has a much lower
impedance than the input of the sound-level meter or measuring amplifier.
When purely electrical measurements are made, that is, when the transducer
is replaced by a dummy load, a step-up transformer can be inserted to raise
the signal voltage, thereby taking it well above the inherent noise in the
measuring equipment. A microphone transformer is ideal for this task
(Figure 8.5).
In view of the need to be mindful of both the change in output between
successive attenuator settings and the overall output of the audiometer, it is
helpful to tabulate results in a way that shows the measured step size and
the cumulative error. Computer spreadsheets make this easy. An example is
shown in Figure 8.6.
The attenuator that controls the masking level can be tested in the same
way as the signal attenuator, either using masking noise itself or, for
two-channel audiometers, using a pure tone source. The tolerance on step
size is the same as for the signal attenuator, but the overall accuracy
required is from â 3 to + 5 dB relative to the indicated hearing level.

FIG. 8.5 Step-up transformer as a substitute for a 10-ohm earphone.
Unwanted Signals
Ideally, the input to the earphone or vibrator should contain the pure tone
signal (the test signal) and nothing else; the tone should cease altogether
when the tone switch is turned off. Contamination of the test signal by
masking noise or other signals from a second channel is often called
cross-talk or breakthrough. It is of course essential that the test signal should
not appear in the nontest earphone when the tone is presented. It is possible
to check for the presence of unwanted signals by listening to the audiometer,
and the IEC standard describes how this should be done. The acoustic
environment in the laboratory is, however, unlikely to be sufficiently quiet
for such methods, and direct electrical measurements are more appropriate.
The standard makes the following recommendations:
(a) At a hearing level control setting of 60 dB and with the tone 'OFF', the
electrical signal in each one-third octave band within the range 125 Hz to
8 kHz shall be at least 10 dB below the signal corresponding to the
reference equivalent threshold level for the centre frequency of the one-

(b) With the tone 'ON', the unwanted signal in the non-test earphone or a
substitute dummy load shall be at least 70 dB below the test tone as
measured when the hearing level is set to 70 dB or greater.
Paragraph (a) refers to the test earphone. The filters are needed not merely

to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the measurements but also to tie the
measurements to a specified reference equivalent threshold. It may be
remarked that the standard offers no enlightenment as to the cross-channel
interference that can be accepted in the test earphone when the tone is on.
The guiding principle should be that the separation between channels
should readily exceed the so-called interaural attenuation for air conduction
audiometry. By convention, the least attenuation is taken to be 40 dB, but

300 Acoustics for Audiologists
we should expect the channel separation to be much greater, perhaps 70 dB,
in line with the other specified requirements. It is also possible that the test
signal may be contaminated by signals from a second channel or other
electrical source even when there is no intended output to the nontest
earphone. The important point being made here is that the signal in the test
earphone must not be contaminated with signals from other sources
(notably from a second channel delivering masking noise to the nontest
earphone) and it must not contain spurious signals that become audible
when the test tone is turned on. It would, for example, be disastrous if mains
hum became audible in the test earphone each time the tone switch was
turned on.
Channel separation requires careful circuit design and layout. Cross-
talk can lead to serious inaccuracies in audiometry, but fortunately it can
often be detected in simple listening tests. The difficulty with objective tests
is that they involve the measurement of low-level signals. They are never-
theless worth doing, at least on some occasions, particularly if the
audiometer is one that has not been tested previously. They are best done
electrically (that is, with dummy loads) as an adjunct to the attenuator
checks.
Distortion
It was explained in Chapter 5 that a periodic, nonsinusoidal signal can be
expressed as the sum of a series of sine and cosine terms whose frequencies
are harmonics of the frequency corresponding to the fundamental period of
the signal. These terms constitute the Fourier series representing the signal.
If the output of an audiometer (or other oscillator) is a true pure tone, then,
by definition, it has just one frequency (the fundamental) and no harmonics.
If it is distorted, it will contain harmonic frequencies in addition to the
fundamental. The amount of distortion, expressed in terms of the harmonics,
is called harmonic distortion. It is particularly important that signals from
an audiometer should be free of distortion. This is because the threshold of
hearing changes considerably with frequency, so that in unfavourable
circumstances harmonics might be audible even when the fundamental is
below threshold. If the listener responds to the harmonics, the audiogram
will show better hearing at the test frequency than actually exists.
Harmonic distortion is usually expressed as a percentage: it is 100 times
the ratio of the rms sound pressure in the harmonic to the rms sound
pressure in the signal as a whole. Quoting again the formulae given in
Chapter 5,

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 301
gives the percentage distortion due to the nth harmonic alone. The same
expressions apply to the distortion in bone conduction signals if the rms
values of the sound pressures are replaced by the corresponding values of
vibratory force. The sound pressures are those measured in an artificial ear
or coupler, and the forces are those measured on a mechanical coupler.
Corrections have therefore to be made for the frequency response of the
microphone and, more important, for the frequency response of the mech-
anical coupler when it is treated as a force-measuring instrument. The
maximum permitted distortion depends on the type of signal (air or bone)
and on frequency (Table 8.3).
Harmonic distortion could be measured using a spectrum analyser, but a
less expensive method is to measure the output of the audiometer after
inserting appropriate narrow-band filters that pass only the required har-
monic frequencies. One-third octave filters are satisfactory for this task. As
with other performance tests, it is not practicable to measure harmonic
distortion at all frequencies on all occasions, but it is worth checking at a
low frequency (250 Hz, for example) where the transducer is operating at a
relatively high output for a given hearing level. Bone vibrators are particu-
larly prone to distortion at low frequencies, to the extent that they are of
limited value in audiometry below 500 Hz. The appearance of the waveform

expresses the total harmonic distortion as a percentage, and

302 Acoustics for Audiologists
of the signal as seen on an oscilloscope is a useful guide to the presence of
distortion. If the waveform is visibly nonsinusoidal, then it is likely that the
permitted limits have been exceeded, particularly in earphone measure-
ments. When testing at 500 Hz or at lower frequencies, the visible distortion
can be enhanced by inserting the A-weighting filter to emphasise the
high-frequency components. If significant distortion is observed, the trans-
ducer should be replaced by a dummy load to determine whether the
problem is in the supply to the transducer or in the transducer itself.
Examples
Suppose that the audiometer is operating at 250 Hz and that the sound
pressure level in the artificial ear is 102 dB SPL. When a filter is inserted
that passes only a narrow band of frequencies centred on 500 Hz, the
measured output is 70 dB SPL. How great is the second-harmonic distor-
tion? To answer this question, let us start by simplifying the formula for
percentage distortion by letting pT represent the root mean square sound
pressure in the unfiltered signal. Then
so that the distortion in the second harmonic is
The fall in sound pressure level on inserting the filter allows us to calculate
P2lpi as follows.
The distortion due to the second harmonic is therefore 2.5%.
Continuing with the same audiometer and earphone, suppose that the
500-Hz filter is replaced by one that passes frequencies centred on 1 kHz
(the third harmonic of 250 Hz) and that a sound pressure of 76 dB SPL is
then observed. Also suppose that measurements with higher-frequency
filters show that components above the third harmonic are negligible. What
is the distortion in the third harmonic, and what is the total distortion?

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 
303
Notice that this is less than the sum of the percentages for the individual
components.
Table 6.1 shows that the A-weighting filter would increase the levels of
the second and third harmonics by 5.4 and 8.6 dB, respectively, relative to
the level of the fundamental. It will be found that the distortion in the
A-weighted waveform is then 4.7% in the second harmonic, 13.5% in the
third harmonic, and 14.3% in total. The waveform of the distorted signal is
shown in Figure 8.7. It can be seen that distortion at 5.6% would be just
visible to someone familiar with the appearance of sinusoidal signals. The
A-weighting reveals a clearly nonsinusoidal form.
Harmonic Distortion: Physical and Audiological Meaning
As already explained, harmonic distortion is usually expressed in terms of
the root mean squares of the sound pressures measured in an artificial ear
or coupler, or in terms of the forces produced by the action of a bone
vibrator at the input to a mechanical coupler. If sound measurements were
made in a free field, the acoustic intensity associated with each harmonic
relative to the intensity of the whole signal would be completely specified by
the particular value of (pn/pT)2 because the acoustic impedance in free sound
waves is virtually independent of frequency so long as the wavefronts are
approximately plane surfaces. Impedance is practically constant except in
standing waves or at points close to a source or obstacle. Suppose that
harmonic distortion is measured in the field of a loudspeaker. The formulas
we have quoted provide a physically meaningful statement of the sound
Proceeding as before,
The distortion due to the third harmonic is therefore 5.0%. The total
harmonic distortion is

the lower two graphs show the undistorted waveform.
energy in each of the harmonics and in the harmonic content as a whole. In
contrast, when measurements are made with an artificial ear or mastoid, the
energy in the harmonics is not simply related to the energy in the funda-
mental because the acoustic or mechanical impedance varies greatly with
frequency. Audiologists will not lose much sleep worrying over this compli-
cation, but they should be aware that the simple physical interpretation has
been lost, though the method for calculating the harmonic distortion still
provides a useful basis for description and specification.
A further difficulty, already alluded to, is that the threshold of hearing is
also frequency dependent when it is expressed as a sound pressure or force
level. This is reflected in the way the equivalent threshold levels change with
frequency (Table 8.1). Although the calculation of harmonic distortion
ignores this problem, it has been recognized in setting performance limits.

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 305
Signals are required to be almost free of the higher harmonics. With
earphones, for example, the permitted distortion in the fourth and higher
harmonics is only 0.3%.
Masking Noise
All audiometers, with the exception of those intended for simple screening
tests (IEC types 4 and 5), provide noise sources for masking pure tones.
Some audiometers also provide alternative noise sources for masking speech
and for special tests. The ideal noise for masking tones is a narrow band
whose width is equal to the psychoacoustic critical band.9 This type of noise
has the least loudness for a given degree of masking. The specification in
IEC 60645-1 is for bands that are similar to the psychoacoustic bands while
having a simple engineering definition, namely, a width of between one-third
and one-half of an octave geometrically centred on the frequency of the tone.
The bands are said to be slightly wider than the critical bands and to have
a less tonal quality. From this definition it can be seen that the cut-off
frequencies for bands of masking noise are given by
/ x 2~1/4 to / x 2~1/6 (lower limit)
/ x 21/4 to / x 21/6 
(upper limit)
where / is the centre frequency. Beyond these limits, the spectrum density
of the noise should fall by at least 12 dB per octave.
The noise spectra are intended as a specification of the sound produced
by an audiometric earphone in a coupler or artificial ear. Because of the
limitations of these devices, measurements at frequencies above 5kHz
should be made electrically across the terminals of the earphone or across
a dummy load.
If the audiometer provides uniform broadband noise (white noise), the
sound spectrum measured in a coupler or artificial ear should be uniform
within + 5 dB between 250 and 4000 Hz. Noise for masking speech will be
described later.
Noise spectra can be measured using a spectrum analyser or suitable
narrow-band filters, but it is only on rare occasions that laboratories will be
asked to make such measurements and, except where a fault exists, there is
little that can be done if the spectra do not conform to the IEC specification.
9The ear behaves as though it possesses a contiguous series of band-pass filters, each having a
bandwidth known as a critical band, defined empirically as a range of frequencies within which
subjective responses are constant. The term was originally used by Fletcher and Munsen to
denote a range of frequencies within a band of noise that alone contribute to the masking of
a tone at the centre frequency. See also Chapter 9.

Note: These levels are to be added to the corresponding reference
equivalent threshold sound pressure levels. The data have been
taken from ISO 389-4 (1994) at selected frequencies. For further
information, refer to the standard.
Fortunately, this characteristic is not critical and audiometers may be
considered perfectly serviceable even if they do not comply entirely with the
standard. It is desirable, however, that the level of the noise should be
consistent with the masking level indicated on the audiometer. In an early
version of the standard,10 the requirement for masking pure tones was
simply that the sound pressure level of the noise should be 3 dB greater than
the level of the tone itself where the level of the noise is measured in a
third-octave band centred on the frequency of the tone. This meant that the
reference levels for narrow-band masking noise were 3 dB greater than the
corresponding reference equivalent threshold sound pressure levels. These
levels have now been refined11 on the basis that the narrow-band noise is
derived from uniform wide-band (white) noise using third-octave or half-
octave band-pass filters with the cut-off frequencies given previously. Refer-
ence levels are then specified according to frequency and bandwidth as listed
in Table 8.4.
Audiometers usually have some means for adjusting the levels of the
masking noise. Measurement and adjustment of the masking noise are often

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment

considered part of the usual calibration routine. Some audiometers (IEC
type 1) allow the noise to be combined with the tone in the same earphone.
This provides a quick and reliable method of checking the effective masking
level of the noiseâthe tone should be just inaudible when the hearing and
masking levels are numerically the same.
Users may sometimes fit alternative transducers for masking that differ
from those originally provided by the manufacturer, and it may then be
impossible to bring the level of the masking noise into correct adjustment.
This will not matter provided that the masking-level scale is treated as an
arbitrary decibel scale rather than one expressing the effective masking level
of the noise. Users will often treat the scale as arbitrary even when it is
correctly calibrated, preferring to find the correct masking level by the
'plateau-seeking' method.
Signal Switch
The switch that turns the tone on or off is usually called the tone switch or
the interrupter. The act of switching a sinusoidal tone inevitably produces
transient signals at frequencies above and below that of the tone itself. It is
obviously important that these unwanted signals should be inaudible;
accordingly, the switching should effect a smooth rise and fall of the tone.
The rise time of a signal is conventionally defined as the time taken for
the signal voltage to rise from 10% to 90% of its final value after the signal
has been turned on; the fall time is defined as the time taken for the signal
voltage to fall from 90% to 10% of its initial value after the signal has been
turned off. When the signal being switched is an alternating voltage (in this
case a tone), then these definitions apply to the signal envelopeâthat is, to
the signal amplitudeârather than to the instantaneous values. The points
defining rise and fall times are therefore exactly â 20 dB and approximately
â 1 dB, respectively, relative to the steady level attained when the tone has
been on for some time (Figure 8.8). For audiometers, the rise and fall times
should each be at least 20 ms. If the tone is pulsed automatically (as it is in
self-recording audiometers), the rise and fall times should not exceed 50 ms.
Greater times are permitted for manual switching, but the time from turning
the tone on to the instant when it reaches 90% of its final value may not
exceed 200 ms. The same limit applies to the falling signal after the switch
is turned off. Further details are given in the standard (IEC 60645-1).
Another consideration is that the tone should never exceed its steady value
by an amount that would make it momentarily audible. The steady level
should not be exceeded by more than 1 dB.

308 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. 8.8 The definition of rise and fall times.
A view of the signal on an ordinary oscilloscope may reveal gross defects
in the switching circuit, such as excessive overshoot, but it is difficult to
make a quantitative assessment of the rise and fall times. If these have to be
measured it is best to use a storage oscilloscope. Nowadays, signal storage
is accomplished digitally, which means that the signal waveform has to be
sampled. Because the rise and fall times are long compared with the time for
each cycle of the tone, a very large number of samples would be needed to
show the entire signal during the intervals defining its rise and fall. Attempts
to measure rise and fall times by sampling the signal itself are likely to lead
to aliasing (see Chapter 5) and to erroneous results. The problem is avoided
by rectification and low-pass filtering of the signal before digital storage. The
stored quantity is then a good approximation to one-half of the signal
envelope, that is, to a function showing the variation in signal amplitude
with time. A suitable rectifier and filter can easily be made from standard
circuit components (Figure 8.9).
Other Checks
Two-channel audiometers usually provide reference tones intended for
loudness balance tests. It is worth checking to see that the reference tone
and the normal test tone are produced with essentially the same sound levels

when the same hearing levels are selected. The levels should be the same
within + 3 dB in the frequency range 500 to 4000 Hz, and Â± 5 dB at other
frequencies.
Headbands can become distorted so that they become too slack or too
tight. A simple spring balance can be used to check the headband tension.
The test conditions for headbands with earphones are that a horizontal line
joining the centres of the earphones shall lie 129 mm below the top of the
headband and the earphones shall be separated horizontally by 145 mm.
The force required to maintain this separation is to be 4.5 Â± 0.5 N. Similar

310 Acoustics for Audiologists
conditions apply to the headbands for bone vibrators. The separation is to
be 145 mm for mastoid application or 190 mm for forehead application, and
the force is to be 5.4 + 0.5 N.
Short-Duration Signals
Short-duration acoustic signals, usually tone bursts or clicks, are essential
to the production of evoked potentials and to the generation of synchro-
nized acoustic emissions from the cochlea. For evoked potentials, the source
is likely to be a supra-aural or insert earphone, but bone vibrators may
occasionally be used even though current models are ill suited to this work.
The object is usually to estimate the threshold of hearing or to examine the
waveform of the response. In either case the notional hearing level of the
stimulus is required; therefore, reference equivalent levels are needed. Al-
though standard reference levels have not yet been agreed upon, work is in
progress with a view to publication in part 6 of ISO 389. In the meantime
users must rely on their own data.
The situation for otoacoustic emissions is different because the object
is not primarily that of finding the threshold level of the stimulus. It is
true that thresholds for the emergence of a recognizable cochlear emission
have been reported, but this is because an audiologist's first reaction to
anything is to measure its threshold. The clinical importance has yet to be
established.
The probe used to detect evoked otoacoustic emissions has both a
sound source and a microphone. Otoacoustic emissions can be measured
in a number of ways, but in the most widely practised clinical test the
sound pressure waveform in the ear canal is observed directly. The equip-
ment is therefore capable of making its own sound pressure calibration
provided that the microphone is itself correctly calibrated. The overall
performance of the probe can usually be tested 'on site' in accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions. A simple test cavity is often sup-
plied for this purpose. For a laboratory test, the performance of the
probe's microphone can be verified by comparison with a standard micro-
phone exposed to the same sound pressure. The absolute calibration
of the microphone is not critical, but the linearity of its response and that
of the sound source are important, especially if the equipment is to be
operated in the nonlinear mode. In this mode it is the nonlinear component
of the ear's response that is being investigated, while the linear part is
cancelled by subtracting linearly scaled responses to different stimuli.
Nonlinearity in the measuring equipment is not likely to go unnoticed

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 311
because it will show itself as an apparent otoacoustic response where none
exists (in a test cavity, for example). The absence of a response in tests on
real ears is a frequent, if audiologically unwelcome, confirmation of equip-
ment linearity.
Guidance on the measurement of short-duration signals is available from
IEC 60645-3. The terms used to characterize these signals are defined and
methods of relating the signal level to hearing level are suggested. The
peak-to-peak equivalent sound pressure level is a particularly important
characteristic that has now become a well-established expression of the
signal level. Its definition as given in the IEC standard (and in Chapter 6)
is, however, questionable in that it invokes a hypothetical electrical signal
used to supply the sound-generating transducer. The words 'same trans-
ducer and same test conditions' are therefore necessary. But a brief acoustic
signal has its own long-duration equivalent regardless of how it is produced.
The peak equivalent is simply an arithmetical expression of a particular
feature of the short-duration pressure waveform; it is the sound pressure
level at the point of measurement corresponding to a sinusoidal vibration
having the same peak-to-peak value as that of the signal being represented.
In other words, if enough is known about the short-duration signal that its
peak-to-peak sound pressure can be measured, then the continuous equiv-
alent sinusoid is completely specified in the abstract with no requirement
other than practical convenience to create such a signal in any real
transducer. The significance of this is that a peak equivalent level can be
measured on a sound-level meter by substituting any sinusoidal input,
acoustic or electrical, that gives the same peak-to-peak response in the
output.
It is manifestly more difficult to measure transient signals than steady
sinusoids. A good-quality microphone is needed, and frequency response of
the measuring apparatus as a whole must be uniform throughout the range
of frequencies that contribute significantly to the Fourier spectrum of the
signal. Phase distortion should be considered, particularly in regard to its
influence on the peak levels in the amplified waveform. Possibly the simplest
way of measuring the peak equivalent of the signal is to observe its
waveform with a two-channel oscilloscope connected to the ac output of the
sound-level meter. The second channel is supplied directly with a rectangu-
lar signal whose display is superimposed on the transient and adjusted so
that both have the same peak-to-peak value. The input to the sound-level
meter is then connected to an appropriate sinusoidal source whose ampli-
tude is adjusted so that the displayed sine wave lies exactly within the limits
of the rectangular wave. The indication on the sound-level meter is then the
peak equivalent of the transient.

312 Acoustics for Audiologists
Sound-Field Audiometry
As applied to audiometry, the term sound field implies that the test sounds
are transmitted to the listener across an open space instead of emanating
from an earphone or a bone vibrator. Sound field tests have several uses,
including research into basic hearing mechanisms, measurement of the
attenuation of hearing protectors, testing the performance of hearing aids,
and measuring the hearing thresholds of children. Audiologists will be
particularly involved with the last two items in this list. In a general clinical
setting it is unlikely that test rooms will be of a quality that permits absolute
measurement with the accuracy possible in earphone work, but valid
comparisons (for example, between different hearing aids) can be made. The
uncertainties in estimating children's hearing have generally far more to do
with the subject material than with the physical acoustics, so here too a
somewhat imperfect test environment may be acceptable.
Sound fields for audiometric work are described in ISO 8253-2. This
standard recognizes the difficulty of providing research-quality test rooms.
In addition to describing the ideal free and diffuse fields, it suggests a more
practical specification for what it calls a quasi-free sound field. The field is
that of a loudspeaker, and a reference axis is specified as being perpendicular
to the surface of the speaker and passing through its centre. The listener,
who is to be seated facing the loudspeaker, is assigned a reference point on
the reference axis and midway along a line connecting the openings of the
ear canals. The reference point should be at least 1 m from the loudspeaker.
The following text is taken from the standard.
To establish quasi-free sound field conditions, the following requirements shall
be complied with.
a) The loudspeaker shall be arranged at the head height of a seated listener,
the reference axis being directed through the reference point. The distance
between the reference point and the speaker's reference point shall be at
least 1 m.
b) With the test subject and the subject's chair absent and all other normal
working conditions maintained, the sound pressure levels produced by the
loudspeaker at positions of 0-15 m from the reference point on the left-right
and up-down axis shall deviate by no more than +2 dB from the sound
pressure level at the reference point for any of the test signals.
c) With the test subject and the subject's chair absent, the difference in sound
pressure levels produced by the loudspeaker at points on the reference axis
at 0-10 m in front of and 0.10 m behind the reference point shall deviate
from the theoretical value given by the inverse square law by no more than
+1 dB for any of the test signals.

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 313
The usable frequency range of the quasi-free sound field is defined by the
frequency range within which these requirements are complied with.
Anyone who has attempted free-field audiometry with pure tones will
appreciate the difficulties caused by standing waves. The interference pat-
terns can be disrupted by using frequency-modulated tones or narrow bands
of noise. The standard makes recommendations concerning these signals.
For frequency-modulated tones, the frequency deviation should be in the
range Â±2.5% to +12.5% with a modulation frequency of 4 to 20 Hz.
Sound field audiometers can be calibrated to indicate either the sound
pressure level in the undisturbed field or the corresponding hearing level. A
hearing level calibration requires reference levels, which the user may have
to obtain for himself by testing a panel of audiologically normal subjects.
Some standard reference thresholds12 have been published in ISO 389-7.
These are for pure tones heard binaurally in a free field and for third-octave
bands of noise heard binaurally in a diffuse field. The threshold values for
the two conditions are remarkably similar, differing by not more than 2 dB
at any frequency below 6000 Hz. Diffuse fields are not usually used for
clinical work, and, as stated above, clinical tests are usually conducted in
quasi-free-field conditions for which the standard free-field reference values
are probably the best available. In some behavioural tests (for example,
where a head turn is an indication that the subject has heard the tone), it
may be necessary to place the loudspeakers off-axis. Corrections for 45Â° and
90Â° incidence are suggested in Annex B of ISO 8253-2.
Reference sound field thresholds for pure tones and third-octave bands of
noise are given in Table 8.5. The data are from ISO 389 at selected
frequencies. Some audiologists use the A-weighted free-field sound pressure
level as an approximate reference threshold and even report A-weighted
levels as hearing levels. The table lists values of the inverse of the A-
weighting function. These values are equal to the unweighted sound pressure
levels (dB SPL re 20 uPa) that exist when the sound-level meter indicates 0
dB(A). They may therefore be compared directly with the tabulated refer-
ence values for pure tones.
Speech Audiometers
Speech audiometers seldom exist as commercially manufactured items in
their own right. Instead, they usually comprise a number of separate
components that have been combined by the user. The input is either live

voice, for which a microphone and possibly a preamplifier are needed, or
more probably, prerecorded speech material on tape or compact disc. A
clinical or diagnostic audiometer is usually used to amplify the signal and
control its level and to provide masking noise. The output is either from
earphones (preferably audiometric earphones) or from loudspeakers, in
which case additional power amplification is sometimes needed. Audiol-
ogists may well assemble such systems themselves, but they would be wise
to seek help from acoustics specialists to ensure that the final product
performs in an appropriate way. A standard specification for speech
audiometers is provided by IEC 60645-2, which should be considered
mandatory (but rather difficult) reading for anyone who is serious about
speech audiometry. The following paragraphs are based on information in
the standard. They are intended only to explain the principles underlying
the calibration of speech equipment. For detailed information, particularly
in regard to tolerances, the reader must consult the original.
Speech audiometers are classified into two main groups: type A and type
A-E provide a wide range of facilities, while type B and type B-E have only
the basics. The letter E specifies the type of calibration that is used when the
output of the audiometer is from an earphone.13 If the letter E is not
included, then the calibration is in terms of the sound pressure in a coupler
or artificial ear without correction. If the E is included, then the earphone
calibration is in terms of what is called the equivalent free field. With this
13 Bone vibrators are occasionally used for speech tests. For completeness, the word earphone
may be understood to imply 'earphone or bone vibrator' when the context is appropriate.

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 315
type of calibration the listener wears earphones but perceives sound as
though it had come from a source of plane progressive waves. The principle
is that speech sounds are radiated from the human speaker into a free field,
recorded, and replayed through earphones. The frequency response of the
audiometer is such that the sound spectrum at the eardrum is the same for
earphone listening as it would be for listening in the free field of the original
source. Correction factors are therefore needed to take into account the
frequency response of the earphone and the transformation of the sound
pressure in the undisturbed field to the sound pressure at the eardrum when
the listener is present.
In practice, it is not necessary to measure the sound pressure at the
eardrum; instead, a loudness balance technique is used. To see how this
works, we need the following definitions:
â¢ Coupler sensitivity: The ratio of the sound pressure generated by the
earphone in an acoustic coupler (or artificial ear) to the voltage at the
terminals of the earphone.
â¢ Coupler sensitivity level: The coupler sensitivity expressed in decibels
relative to 1 Pa/V. Symbol Gc.
â¢ Free-field sensitivity: At a given frequency, the ratio of the sound
pressure in frontally incident plane progressive waves to the voltage
that must be applied to the earphone so that the source of the plane
waves and the sound heard in the earphone are equally loud. The
results of loudness judgements are to be averaged for at least 10
otologically normal listeners. Listening may be binaural, but the
resulting sensitivity is deemed to be that of a single earphone.
â¢ Free-field sensitivity level: The free-field sensitivity expressed in decibels
relative to 1 Pa/V. Symbol GF.
Audiologists will be relieved to find that they are not required to undertake
the difficult task of determining these sensitivities for themselves. Values of
GF â Gc for commonly used earphones in combination with the standard
coupler or artificial ear are given in Annex A of the IEC publication. Adding
these values to the sound pressure levels measured in a coupler will give the
corresponding sound pressure levels in a free field. The merit of calibration
in terms of the free-field equivalent output is that speech tests using different
types of transducer are directly comparable. This form of calibration is not
mandatory, however, and despite its advantages, it is probably more usual
to find that speech audiometers are calibrated directly in terms of the sound
pressure in a coupler without the free-field correction. This provides what
the IEC standard calls the 'uncorrected earphone output'.
The frequency response of a speech audiometer is an important charac-
teristic that has to be established before it can be calibrated. If we assume

316 Acoustics for Audiologists
that a clinical audiometer is used to amplify and control the speech signal
(but not to record or to play back), then the frequency response of the
audiometer for speech signals can be investigated by applying an electrical
test signal with a constant rms voltage to the input and measuring the sound
pressure level at the output. For calibrations using the uncorrected coupler
response, the sound pressure in the coupler should be the same at all
frequencies; for a free-field equivalent calibration, it should have a constant
value plus the frequency-dependent correction described earlier; for loud-
speakers, the frequency response should be uniform. The frequency response
should be measured using test signals comprising third-octave bands of
noise. Further details of the test signals and the tolerances on frequency
response are given in the standard.
The measurement of frequency response using an electrical test signal at
the input to the audiometer is valid for the speech system as a whole
provided that the output from the playback system is a faithful representa-
tion of the sound pressure in the original speech signal at the recording
microphone. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the appropriate equal-
ization networks are included in the playback system.
Calibration of the output level of a speech audiometer is analogous to the
calibration of a pure tone audiometer, but difficulties soon become apparent.
Speech itself is a complex signal; furthermore, the test material can be
recorded in several different waysâfor example, as lists of single words or
as words or phonemes within a carrier phrase. Various methods have been
used to express the sound level in the test material. The following quotation
is taken from IEC 60645.
Speech level The sound pressure level or the vibratory force level of the
speech signal measured in an appropriate coupler, ear simulator or in a sound
field with a specified frequency weighting and specified time weighting.
Notes
1. For example, the speech level may be expressed as the equivalent
continuous sound pressure level or vibratory force level determined by
integration over the duration of the speech signals with frequency
weighting C. For speech tests based on single test items separated by
silent intervals, the integration should not include these intervals. For test
lists based on single test items with carrier phrase, the integration should
include test items only.
2. For lists of single test items the equivalent continuous sound pressure
level may be estimated by subtracting 5 dB from the average of the
maximum measured sound pressure levels using frequency weighting C
and time weighting I. [What this note means is that the greatest
C-weighted impulse response is obtained for each item in the list and
then averaged for all items].

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 317
Speech level is analogous to the sound pressure level in a pure tone. In
pure tone audiometry, the threshold of hearing is the level of the tone when
it can just be detected; in speech audiometry, the speech recognition threshold
level is the lowest speech level of the test material at which 50% of the
material can be correctly identified by the listener. The reference speech
recognition threshold level is then the median value of the recognition level
for otologically normal listeners. In principle, then, a standard speech
recognition scale can be constructed in a similar way to the hearing level
scale for tones, subtracting the reference recognition level from the speech
level. A level on this scale is called the hearing level for speech. The zero of
the scale is the level at which otologically normal listeners achieve a
recognition score of 50%. There is, however, no universally defined reference
level and no universal hearing level for speech. The user or the manufacturer
of the test material must establish a reference level by testing the material
on normal listeners. The purpose of standardization is, however, to ensure
so far as is possible that users of the same test material will be able to obtain
comparable results, and in principle a reference recognition level should
have universal validity for a given material.
Audiometer manufacturers need some guidance as to how speech equip-
ment should be calibrated, given that it will be used with different speech
materials. The IEC standard makes a simple recommendation in which the
output is specified in relation to a calibration signal applied at the input.
Unfortunately, it seems that it has not been possible to agree on an exact
specification of the calibration signal other than its level. The signal, which
should be continuous, can be a frequency-weighted random noise such as
that used for masking speech, a band of noise, or a frequency-modulated
tone centred on 1 kHz having a bandwidth of at least a third-octave. This
signal should be recorded together with the test material at a level equal to
the average speech level in the record.
The speech audiometer has a signal-level indicator (a VU meter14) to
monitor the level of the signal at a stage in the amplifier before the
output-level control. The scale of the VU meter is marked with a reference
point that is normally used to set the gain of the amplifier when replaying
the calibration signal prior to audiometry. A laboratory calibration is
required to ensure that the audiometer produces a defined output in
response to an input test signal when the gain is adjusted to give the
reference VU indication. The output depends, of course, on the setting of the
output-level control (the signal attenuator). On many audiometers the
output indication is an arbitrary scale in decibels, but for audiometers
14A VU meter is a meter for measuring the level of signals such as music and speech, with a
response characteristic approximating that of the human ear. The time constant is 65 ms. See
IEC 60268-17.

318 Acoustics for Audiologists
complying with the IEC standard the scale should indicate either sound
pressure level (types A-E or B-E) or hearing level for speech (types A or B).
If the scale is marked in sound pressure level, the output sound pressure
level in a free field, or its equivalent in a coupler or ear simulator, should
be as shown on the scale when the input produces the reference VU
indication. If the scale is marked in hearing level, the output sound pressure
level is numerically 20 dB above the scale indication; that is, 20 dB SPL
corresponds to 0 dB HL for speech. These requirements are expressed in the
standard by defining a 'reference position' of the output control at 20 dB for
types A-E and B-E and at 0 dB for types A and B. With the control at the
reference position and the input giving the reference VU indication, the
output should be 20 dB SPL (or 55 dB re 1 /iN for bone vibrators).
Although, as stated earlier, a standard reference threshold level for speech
does not exist, it is generally the case that a sound pressure level of 20 dB
corresponds approximately to a speech recognition of 50% for easily
recognizable material. The standard hearing level calibration for types A
and B is therefore a useful starting point that can be established by
laboratory calibration. The user may add or subtract a correction according
to the results of speech tests with the particular material being used.
The sound pressure level of 20 dB is given for reference purposes, but
it is too low for actual calibration. In practice, a much greater output is
needed to achieve an adequate signal-to-noise ratio in the test equipment.
The standard recommends that the calibration should be made with the
level control set to 70 dB for earphones or loudspeakers, or 40 dB for
vibrators. The calibration will normally be made with an input signal
consisting of a third-octave band of noise centred on 1 kHz. The input gain
is set to give the reference VU indication. For a loudspeaker, the free-field
sound pressure at a distance of 1 m on the reference axis should be 70 dB
SPL; the sound pressure in a coupler or artificial ear should be
70 + (GF - Gc) dB SPL for a type E calibration, or 90 dB SPL for an
uncorrected calibration.
Masking Noise
Masking is used in pure tone audiometry to exclude the nontest ear. It is
sometimes needed in speech audiometry for the same reason. Another use
of masking noise in speech audiometry is to provide a competing sound,
making the listener's task that of identifying speech in background noise.
Often special types of noise such as 'speech babble' are used for this purpose,
but broad-band noise with a spectrum approximating that of the long-term
speech spectrum is a frequently used alternative. Speech-in-noise tests can

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 319
be made in a free field using loudspeakers, but masking, in the sense of
excluding the nontest ear, applies only to earphone tests.
The ability to generate speech-weighted noise is mandatory for all speech
equipment specified in IEC 60645. The masking noise should ideally have a
constant spectrum level in the frequency range 125 to 1000 Hz and fall at
12 dB per octave for frequencies between 1000 and 6000 Hz. The level for
frequencies beyond 6000 Hz is not specified. If loudspeakers are used, the
specification applies to measurements made acoustically in a free field; for
earphones, it applies to coupler or artificial ear measurements with or
without the equivalent free-field correction, depending on type.
The masking-level control should indicate either sound pressure level of
the noise (types A-E and B-E) or its effective masking level (types A and B).
The latter is defined as a level numerically equal to the increase in the speech
recognition threshold due to the presence of the noise. It may be determined
empirically for a group of normal listeners by combining the masking noise
and the speech signal in the same earphone. For loudspeakers, the sound
pressure level in the field should be the same as that indicated on the
masking-level control. The same is true for a type E calibration with
earphones, but allowance has to be made for the correction terms. For
uncorrected coupler measurements, the masking-level control should be
calibrated in terms of effective masking level, and the sound pressure in the
coupler or artificial ear should be numerically 20 dB greater than the
indication on the level control.
Tympanometers
The word tympanometers is a convenient shorthand for instruments for the
measurement of aural acoustic impedance/admittance, which is the title of IEC
61027. These instruments have a system for measuring the acoustic admit-
tance (or sometimes impedance) of the ear, a system for controlling the static
pressure in the external ear canal, and a system to provide tones or bands
of noise that evoke the acoustic reflex. There must also be a means of
displaying and recording the test results.
Their maintenance and calibration is usually a matter of following the
instructions in the makers' service manual. A point to bear in mind is that
it is inadvisable to expose the calibrating microphone to large changes in
static pressure. For this reason, the pneumatic system should be disabled
prior to acoustic measurements in a coupler or artificial ear. This may
involve disconnecting the pressure tube that supplies the probe, but care
should be taken to see that the disconnection does not in itself change the
sound pressure in the coupler by creating an acoustic leak. The usual

320 Acoustics for Audiologists
laboratory inspection includes checking the frequency and level of the probe
tone, checking the admittance or compliance indicated when the probe is
connected to standard calibrating cavities, checking the static pressure, and
checking the stimulus system. Stimulus levels and frequencies may be tested
in the same way as they would be for audiometers. Calibration is in terms
of hearing level. There are no standard reference thresholds for some types
of stimuli that are often provided, but the requisite sound pressures for
calibration will be specified by the manufacturer.
Calibrating the Calibrators
The equipment for calibrating audiometers has itself to be tested and
calibrated from time to time. This may, on occasion, mean having micro-
phones and mechanical couplers calibrated by national laboratories, but
there are less expensive in-house methods that can reveal a significant
change in performance between visits to the laboratory. A sound-level
meter, excluding its microphone, can be tested by applying a known
electrical input. An internal reference source is usually provided for this
purpose, but it is worth making an occasional test with an external source.
A suitable adapter may be needed to remove the microphone polarizing
voltage. The microphone can be tested using a pistonphone. Its sensitivity
(in volts per pascal) should agree with the manufacturer's specification, and
there should be no significant change between measurements. The perform-
ance of the measuring system as a whole should be checked periodically by
measuring the output of a reference earphone or bone vibrator kept for this
purpose. National laboratories will usually be willing to calibrate the
reference earphones and vibrators on their own couplers, ear simulators,
and mechanical couplers. Provided that these calibrations can be replicated,
there is no need to repeat the exercise.
Some medical equipment laboratories may wish to undertake their own
calibrations of microphones and mechanical couplers. Methods for calibra-
ting microphones were described in Chapter 6. The necessary equipment
and advice on how to use it can be obtained from acoustic instrument
manufacturers. In-house calibration of mechanical couplers is also possible.
Briiel & Kjaer, currently the principal manufacturer, describe how the
performance of the mechanical coupler may be measured, but there is little
in the audiological literature regarding this work. The following brief
account is based on the methods described by Briiel & Kjaer (B&K) with
some modifications suggested by the author.
The coupler under test is driven through an impedance head by a
high-quality vibrator. The impedance head (B&K type 8000) comprises an

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 321
accelerometer and a force gauge.15 The gauge is applied to the surface of
the mechanical coupler with the standard coupling force (5.4 + 0.5 N),
and its output gives an accurate indication of the vibratory force at the
input to the coupler. Measurement of the corresponding output of the
coupler provides the desired calibration. It is, however, necessary to
correct the output of the force gauge for the voltage produced by virtue of
the mass of the gauge itself. This mass, described by the manufacturer as 'the
mass below the gauge', is typically about 1-lgm. It is part of the vibrating
system and therefore subject to the same acceleration. A correction, propor-
tional to acceleration, can be derived from the output of the accelerometer
and subtracted electronically from the force signal. When this is done
correctly the force gauge should register no significant output if, having been
removed from the mechanical coupler, it is made to vibrate without external
load.
If money is no object, then the mechanical coupler, the force gauge, and
the accelerometer can each be provided with a conditioning amplifier
(preamplifier) and a sound-level meter or measuring amplifierâan arrange-
ment favoured by the manufacturer. A cheaper alternative is to dispense
with the conditioning amplifiers (direct input to the sound-level meters is
usually quite acceptable) and to work with just two-sound level meters. One
of these is used to measure the applied vibratory force (the force-level meter)
and the other is used either to measure acceleration or to measure the
output of the mechanical coupler. It is necessary to construct a simple circuit
to compensate for the mass of the force gauge. The circuit, which is inserted
between the external filter sockets of the force-level meter, requires two
inputs, one from the ac output of the meter measuring acceleration and one
from the output-to-filter socket of the force-level meter. The signal levels
have to be suitably adjusted (using potentiometers) and then subtracted
with a differential amplifier whose output is returned to the input-from-filter
socket. This method of compensation works well but its operation is
restricted to predetermined settings of the input gains of the sound-level
meters.
The accelerometer does more than provide a source of correction for the
force gauge. It enables the velocity of the vibration to be calculated (velocity
equals acceleration divided by angular frequency). The ratio of the vibratory
force to the vibratory velocity is the mechanical impedance of the coupler.
The impedance can be resolved into its real and imaginary parts by
measuring the phase difference between the acceleration and the force.
15The calibration of the accelerometer can be verified at low frequencies using the acceleration
due to gravity as a reference. If the acceleration is known the calibration of the force gauge
can also be checked by loading it with a known mass. (P. M. Haughton. B. J. Audiol. 19:
53-56, 1985.)

322 Acoustics for Audiologists
The driving vibrator for calibrating the mechanical coupler is likely to be
quite heavy. For example, the B&K type 4810 'minishaker' weighs 1-1 kg,
so that a special attachment is needed to apply it to the mechanical coupler.
A good engineering solution is to suspend the vibrator from a cord that
passes over pulleys to a counterweight. This weight is made equal to that of
the static components of the vibrator. A loading weight equal to 5.4 N
(550 gm) less the weight of the dynamic components (armature, 18 gm, and
impedance head, 29 gm) is suspended by elastic rings from an attachment at
the base of the impedance head. The specified coupling load will then be
exerted when the force gauge is brought into contact with the top of the
mechanical coupler so that it supports the impedance head and the loading
weight, and the axial force between the case of the vibrator and its armature
will be removed (Figure 8.10).
Because of limitations in the performance of currently available imped-
ance heads, traceable force calibrations of mechanical couplers can only be
provided at frequencies below 6 kHz.
Audiometric Zero: Problems in its Definition
and Standardization
There would be little clinical interest in the threshold of hearing were it not
for the fact that nearly all hearing disorders are accompanied by a loss of
auditory sensitivity. Indeed, the patient with a normal audiogram who
presents with hearing difficulty is likely to be diagnosed as having an
'obscure auditory dysfunction'. So, clinically at least, the threshold concept
is of great practical value. The clinician would be justified in thinking that
the measurement of hearing thresholds is a rather simple procedure in which
the patient is presented with a series of defined sounds and asked if they are
audible. As such, it is little more than a tuning fork test, refined and made
quantitative. Yet the subject is bedevilled with methodological and technical
difficulties that have not been fully resolved despite the many research
publications that have been devoted to it. Part, if not all, of the difficulty is
that audiometry has become much more than a simple clinical test. Its role
has been expanded to include studies in auditory physiology, psychology,
epidemiology, occupational health, and forensic medicine, with ever-increas-
ing demands for better precision, better standardization, and more reliable
calibration. Underlying this effort has been the need to refine the definition
and realization of audiometric zeroâthat physical stimulus that corre-
sponds to the normal threshold of hearing.

Readers who undertake calibration work for themselves will soon find
that the standards specifying audiometric zero have a long pedigree. The
plethora of standards, constantly under revision, and the existence of
numerous inconsistencies may seem bewildering. It may be astonishing that
after so many years there are still two independent definitions of the air
conduction zero: a universal one involving the artificial ear and an exclusive
one applying to just two types of earphone with the 9A coupler. If a
manufacturer were to produce a new model of earphone that was acousti-
cally identical to the TDH-39 but which had a different name, it would have
to be calibrated on the artificial ear rather than the coupler. Indeed, when

324 Acoustics for Audiologists
the TDH-39's two-piece MX41/AR earphone cushion was replaced by a
single-piece version, calibrating laboratories were uncertain whether to use
the coupler or the artificial ear. Common sense prevailed and the standard
now includes the single-piece model 51 cushion as an alternative in coupler
measurements. In principle, the artificial ear should have made the acoustic
coupler obsolete and only one set of reference values should now be needed.
But the path to standardization is a difficult one, requiring compromise and
pragmatism. It is therefore not surprising to discover that the calibration of
the Telephonies and Beyer earphones would change slightly if it were made
on the artificial ear instead of the coupler.16 An audiometer with a TDH-39
that was perfectly calibrated on the coupler would appear to be slightly out of
calibration if its earphone were transferred to the artificial ear, even allowing
for the differences in the reference thresholds. The widespread use of the
TDH-39 and DT-48 earphones may have provided the political justification
for retaining the coupler as a standardizing device, but its days are numbered.
Bone conduction also has its anomalies. The mechanical coupler used to
calibrate bone vibrators is specified in IEC 373 (now IEC 60373). In the first
edition of this standard the mechanical impedance of the coupler was given
in terms of its mechanical resistance and reactance, providing a complete
physical specification. Because of manufacturing difficulties, the specification
was later changed. The current (1990) version of the standard gives only the
modulus of the mechanical impedance (which differs slightly from that in
the original version) and gives the phase angle at just one frequency. We are
told that the desired mechanical response will be obtained when the
viscoelastic rubbers used in the coupler have the specified mix and are cured
in the specified manner. Physics has been replaced by cookery 'to meet the
urgent needs of users in the audiometric and hearing aid fields'.
Technical problems aside, there remains a fundamental obstacle to the
definition of audiometric zero in that threshold itself is an elusive quantity.
Hearing, in the sense of detecting the presence of sound, can be regarded as
a noise-limited process. The noise is physiological, inherent in the sensory
apparatus and perhaps the neural mechanisms that come after it. It is
analogous to the inherent noise in physical apparatus, such as a sound-level
meter. If this view is correct, then measuring the normal threshold of hearing
is analogous to measuring the inherent noise in a laboratory instrument.
The essential difference is that instrument noise is self-evident â we do not
have to probe a sound-level meter with test sounds to find the point at
which it responds; we simply observe the indication when external sounds
are removed. But so far as we know, there is no alternative method for
finding the limiting performance of the human ear.

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 325
Let us consider briefly, and in a somewhat simplified way, the steps
leading to the practical definition of the normal threshold of hearing. They
are as follows:
1. Select a group of individuals whose hearing is normal.
2. Measure the hearing thresholds of each individual. Each threshold
value is expressed as the rms voltage across the terminals of the
earphone when it is producing a tone at the threshold of hearing.
3. Undertake a statistical analysis of the results so obtained and thereby
derive a value of the earphone voltage corresponding to what shall be
taken as the normal threshold of hearing.
4. Couple the earphone to a microphone using a standard acoustic
coupler and, applying the voltage derived in the previous step, find the
sound pressure level corresponding to the normal threshold of hearing.
5. Steps 1 to 4 are also undertaken at other laboratories. Results are
compared and a consensus reached as to the sound pressure that will
represent the normal threshold of hearing. This sound pressure, ex-
pressed in decibels, is what we have called the reference equivalent
sound pressure level (RETSPL). Reference pressure levels are required
for each frequency used in audiometry.
6. To calibrate an individual audiometer, the earphone is applied to a
standard coupler and the output of the audiometer is adjusted so that
the sound pressure level in the coupler is equal to the indicated hearing
level plus the reference equivalent pressure level for the frequency
concerned.
Steps 4 and 6 involve only the direct measurement of a physical quantity
(sound pressure). Any difficulties here are merely technical. On the other
hand, the methods leading to the definition of a reference sound pressure are
if anything closer to the biological and behavioural sciences than they are
to physics. They are associated with problems that are almost, though
perhaps not entirely, absent in purely physical measurement.
To illustrate this, consider an example of the kind of measurement that
lies entirely in the domain of the physical sciences. Suppose a physicist is
asked to measure the density of pure gold. The physicist would probably
accept without question that there is such a substance as pure gold, or that
samples could be obtained for which impurities were present in such small
amounts as to have a negligible influence on the result, and would consider
that the task was the technical one of finding the volume and mass of a
sample in terms of the standard metre and the standard kilogram. Col-
leagues might be asked to perform similar measurements. They would, of
course, obtain different results because no measurement is perfect, but they
would accept the proposition that there is such a thing as a 'true' result that

326 Acoustics for Audiologists
could be approached ever more closely as methods of measurement are
refined. But is there such a thing as 'true' threshold of hearing or a 'truly
normal' person? The answer has to be no. In the first place, the threshold
of hearing requires a statistical definition. It is not an absolute. There is no
sound level below which a tone is always inaudible and above which it is
always audible. Moreover, the method of presentation (the audiometric test
method) influences the result to an important degree. Threshold therefore
has to be defined both statistically and with reference to the method of test.
By contrast, the density of gold is imagined to be the same regardless of how
it is measured.
We may imagine that 'normal hearing' is something that can readily be
understood, and so it can be in a colloquial sense, but when a rigorous
definition is needed for scientific purposes, normality seems hard to define.
The audiological standards have, over the years, described the 'otologically
normal person' in various ways. They amount to the same thing. The
following is from ISO 389-1 (1998):
Otologically normal personâa person in a normal state of health who is free
from all signs or symptoms of ear disease and from obstructing wax in the ear
canal, and who has no history of undue exposure to noise, exposure to
potentially ototoxic drugs, or familial hearing loss.
This definition, however well intentioned, does little but make some ob-
vious exclusions. It is a definition that has been created retrospectively
on combining data from disparate studies. The only further qualification is
that the reference population should comprise 'a sufficient number of ears
of otologically normal persons, of both sexes, aged between 18 and 30
years'.17
One of the most cogent signs of ear disease is a raised hearing threshold.
Should audiometric zero be defined with respect to the hearing of persons
selected for their good hearing? Exclusion criteria such as a hearing thres-
hold that exceeds the modal value by more than 15 or 20 dB have often been
applied, but the case against such criteria is that they create an arbitrary
modification of the threshold statistics. On the other hand, the subject's
history and the results of otological examination are legitimate and impor-
tant considerations.18 In other respects the specification for the test subjects
is quite liberal. It makes no mention of anatomical size, or ethnic factors, or
even the mental ability to perform an exacting hearing test under laboratory
conditions. Nor does it mention factors such as socioeconomic class that
17The age range is sometimes given as 18 to 25 years (e.g. in IEC 60645-2).

may be considered to have a bearing on audiometric performance.19 It
would probably be pointless to insist on a more restrictive definition. The
general sense is only that the test population should consist of young,
healthy people.
Having chosen the test subjects it is then necessary to measure their
hearing thresholds. There are obviously several ways of doing this, but ISO
389 is perversely silent on the matter, although its bibliography cites ISO
8253, where a detailed account of audiometric test methods can be found.
Even here there is little guidance as to how results should be interpreted in
relation to audiometric zero. It is generally held that the bracketing or
ascending methods of manual audiometry lead to results in line with the
current expression of audiometric zero, whereas self-recording (Bekesy)
audiometry is said to yield thresholds that are lower by approximately 3 dB.
19A. Davis. Hearing in Adults. Whurr Publishers, London, 1995. This work reports a survey of
hearing in the adult population of England, Scotland, and Wales. Data are analysed by age,
sex, and socioeconomic class (manual worker versus nonmanual worker).

The Calibration and Testing of Audiometric Equipment 329
A further consideration is that the signal level for manual audiometry is
usually varied in 5-dB steps. This feature is not mentioned in the definition
of audiometric zero, and it is tempting to assume that reference value is
therefore independent of step size. The ascending and bracketing methods
introduce an average 2.5-dB rounding error when a 5-dB step is used, and
this is sometimes subtracted in the belief that audiometric zero should be
the unbiased estimate of the normal threshold.
Although the distribution of hearing thresholds within the populace at
large is highly skewed in the direction of impaired hearing, a far more
symmetrical distribution is found within the selected test populations used
to establish the normal values. Accordingly, it may make little difference
whether the mean, the median, or the modal value of threshold is taken as
representative, but the lack of consistency in the standards is irksome. In
fact all three measures are quoted:
Modal value, ISO 389-1, RETSPL for air conduction
Mean value, ISO 389-3, RETFL for bone conduction
Median value, IEC 60645-3, clause 6 (hearing level for short-duration
signals)
The difficulties and inconsistencies just described raise questions that are
difficult or even impossible to answer. In one sense it is important that
reference thresholds should be an accurate representation of 'normality', at
least as it is generally understood. This ensures that the normal audiogram
is a more or less horizontal line from which departures have an obvious
clinical interpretation. But in another sense it does not really matter if the
reference values are 'wrong', provided that everyone uses the same values
and that all calibrations lead to the same stimulus regardless of the
particular earphone or bone vibrator that generates it.
Questions and Exercises
8.1 Explain what is meant by a hearing level for pure tones. What is the
essential difference between the hearing level scale and the sound
pressure level scale? What is meant by a reference equivalent sound
pressure level?
8.2 An audiometric earphone is fitted to an artificial ear (type 60318-1).
The audiometer is connected to the earphone, and the signal-level
control is set to 60 dB HL for an 8-kHz tone. The sound-level meter
indicates a sound pressure level in the artificial ear of 72.2 dB SPL. The
meter has been calibrated using a pistonphone so that its indication is

330 Acoustics for Audiologists
correct to the nearest 0-1 dB at 250 Hz. The microphone sensitivity is
known to be 0.9 dB lower at 8kHz than at 250 Hz. Using the
appropriate reference sound pressure given in Table 8.1, find the true
hearing level of the tone.
8.3 An audiometer, normally used with supra-aural earphones, is to be
used occasionally with ER-3A insert earphones. The insert earphone is
found to produce the following sound pressure levels in an occluded-
ear simulator (IEC 60711) when the signal-level control on the
audiometer is set to 60 dB HL. Refer to Table 8.2 to find what
corrections should be added to the values indicated on the signal-level
control to obtain the correct hearing levels. Round the results to the
nearest 1 dB. Note: The sound pressure levels given below are entirely
fictitious.

8.4 An audiometer is set to deliver a 250-Hz bone-conducted signal at
35dB HL. The force level, measured on an artificial mastoid, is 102dB
re 1uN. Is the audiometer correctly calibrated? When the signal is
filtered to remove the 250-Hz component, the force level falls to 78 dB.
Calculate the total harmonic distortion. Is it acceptable? Refer to
Tables 8.1 and 8.3.
8.5 Calculate the lower and upper cut-off frequencies for third-octave
masking noise centered on 1000 Hz. If the noise is intended to mask a
1-kHz tone at 50 dB HL, what sound pressure level should be observed
if the masking earphone (type TDH-39) is applied to a 6-cc coupler
(IEC 60318-3)? See Tables 8.1 and 8.4.
8.6 In response to a rectangular pulse, an earphone produces a transient
in which the sound pressure rises to 0.32 Pa It then falls to â0.20 Pa
before returning to the baseline. Calculate the peak-to-peak equivalent
sound pressure level of the signal. What is the peak sound pressure
level?
8.7 For sound field audiometry, an audiometer is et to deliver a 250-Hz,
frontally incident tone at 60 dB HL. In the absence of the test subject,
the A-weighted sound pressure level at the reference point is
62.0 dB(A). What is the corresponding sound pressure level without
weighting? If the ISO reference applies, what is the hearing level of the
tone? (Refer to Tables 8.5 and 6.1.)

8.8 In the context of speech audiometry using earphones, what is meant
by an equivalent free field?
8.9 What is meant by hearing level for speech? A speech audiometer
complying with IEC 60645, type A, is set so that the output-level
control indicates a hearing level of 50 dB. The test signal is a narrow
band of noise centred on 1 kHz. If the amplifier is adjusted so that this
signal produces an indication at the reference point on the VU meter,
what sound pressure would you expect to observe when the earphone
is applied to an appropriate acoustic coupler?

Audiometric Test Rooms
The accurate measurement of hearing requires an extraordinarily quiet test
environment, particularly when the subject has normal hearing and the test
is being made by bone conduction. The reason is, of course, that environ-
mental sounds mask the threshold that is being measured. To understand
the problem, we need to know the relationship between the acoustics of
these sounds and the increase in hearing threshold that they effect. We shall
refer to the environmental sound as noise and assume that the test signal is
a pure tone.
Hearing Pure Tones in Noise
It is well established that the auditory system behaves as though it pos-
sesses a series of band-pass filters. The bandwidth of each is called a critical
band, and together the critical bands form a contiguous set that covers
the entire range of audible frequencies (Table 9.1). It should be under-
stood that the bands listed in the table constitute an arbitrary set insofar as
the frequency of any one member of the set can be chosen without
restriction. We can make an analogy with the tuning circuit on a radio â
one that has a variable capacitor connected to the tuning dial to allow any
frequency to be selected within the displayed range. Similarly, we could
choose any frequency and discover a psychoacoustic critical band centred
on it. Having chosen one band, the others can then be selected so that the
upper cut-off frequency of each coincides with the lower cut-off frequency of
its neighbour. In psychoacoustic terms, the width of a critical band is
approximately equal to 60 difference limens of frequency. Physiologically,
the position of the maximum vibration on the basilar membrane moves
basally by approximately 1.3 mm as the frequency is increased from the
lower to the upper limit of the band. The psychoacoustic filters differ in
some respects from the filters that we are familiar with in electrical
engineering. They are asymmetric, having a steeper cut-off on the high-
frequency side than on the low-frequency side, and their bandwidth (so far
as it can be defined) is probably not entirely independent of the level of the
signals that are being passed. A consequence of the asymmetry (which is

mirrored in Bekesy's travelling wave) is that signals whose frequencies are
above the band are rejected more effectively than signals whose frequencies
are below it.
Suppose a pure tone is heard against a background of noise that has a
more or less uniform spectrum over a wide range of frequencies (white
noise). The threshold of hearing for the tone is of course greater than it
would be if the noise were absent, and we can describe the noise as a masker.
To a first approximation the tone is masked only by those frequencies of the
noise that fall within a critical band centred on the frequency of tone. This
is, however, only an approximation because the psychoacoustic filter does
not have an infinitely rapid cut-off. Noise components whose frequencies are

Audiometric Test Rooms 335
outside the critical band do contribute to masking. Their effect is called
remote masking, as distinct from local masking, which is masking by
components within the critical band containing the tone.
The performance of the psychoacoustic filter is demonstrated in a well-
known diagram by Zwicker, reproduced here in Figure 9.1. Each curve in
the diagram shows, as a function of frequency, the sound pressure level in a
pure tone at the threshold of hearing. The tone is heard against a back-
ground consisting of a 200-Hz band of noise, centred on 1200 Hz. A family
of threshold curves is shown, each for a constant noise level between 20 and
110 dB SPL. The curves converge at their base to the nonmasked threshold
(the absolute threshold). It is immediately evident from the diagram that the
masking effect of a band of noise is greatest for tones at the centre frequency
of the band. The peaks of the masking curves are separated by 10-dB
intervals on the vertical axis, showing that the threshold for a tone in the
centre of a critical band increases by 10 dB for each 10-dB increase in the
level of the masker. This is also nearly true for tones of lower frequency

presence of a narrow band of noise centre on 1200 Hz. The parameter L is the
sound pressure level of the noise. (Reproduced from E. Zwicker, Uber psychol-
ogische und methodische grundlagen der lautheit. Acustica 8: 237-258, 1958.)

336 Acoustics for Audiologists
(Figure 9.2). However, if the frequency of the tone is above the upper limit
of the band, 2 kHz for example, the increase in threshold level with masking
level is nonlinear. Above the critical band the downward slope of the curves
in Figure 9.1 becomes progressively less steep as the noise level is increased,
and intercepts on a vertical line at 2 kHz are not uniformly spaced. The
increase in masking effect with noise level is generally more rapid than it
would be for tones within or below the band.
We have yet to consider the masking effect of a noise whose level is close
to the threshold of hearing. Again, the signal being masked is a pure tone.
We shall suppose that the noise comes from a wide-band source whose
masking is attributed to components within a critical band centred on the
tone. If the noise is present at a very low level, it produces no discernible
masking. As its level is raised the threshold of the tone begins to rise, slowly
at first, but eventually matching the increase in the noise as previously
described. The masking function is shown in Figure 9.3. An explanation of
the nonlinear form of this function is that the threshold of the tone is
determined by the total noise level at some (unspecified) place within the
auditory system. The noise comprises internal physiological noise together
with noise due to the masker. Let T0 dB be the threshold in the absence of
masking, and let T dB be the threshold when sound pressure level in the
band of masking noise is LN dB. We suppose that the internal noise is
equivalent to an external noise whose level is L0 dB. Then, working in

and
where the signal-to-noise ratio k is assumed to be constant.
Dividing the second equation by the first and converting the result to
decibels gives
This equation gives the increase in threshold T â T0 of a pure tone as a
result of masking by a noise whose sound pressure level is LN dB above L0
in the critical band. It is based on the assumption that the listener's ability
to detect the presence of the tone depends on the sound energy in the
masker added to the energy associated with internal physiological noise that
is assumed to determine the absolute limit of hearing. The derivation implies
that the signal-to-noise ratio, namely, the energy in the tone to that in the
noise, is constant at the threshold of detectability. Not everyone would
agree, and it has been argued that characteristics other than the acoustic

338 Acoustics for Audiologists
energy of the signal are implicated. This is true insofar as we recognize a
tone for what it is â something that has a tonal quality that distinguishes it
from the noise. If the energy of the signal is not itself the determining factor,
then signal-to-noise ratio is not necessarily constant. Whatever the truth of
the matter, the masking function near the absolute threshold is at least
approximately as described by Equation 9.1. The masking it describes is
shown by the curve in Figure 9.3. The points in the figure are experimental
values. The levelling at the foot of the curve shows that external noise has
a masking effect even when the sound pressure in the noise (within a critical
bandwidth) is less than that in a tone at the absolute threshold of hearing.
Moreover, it is known that pure tone signals can be detected when the
signal-to-noise ratio in the critical band is as little as â4 dB. Taken together
these observations suggest that environmental noise levels have to be
exceedingly low if audiometric thresholds are to be unaffected. A further
difficulty is that the normal threshold of hearing is an average, and many
normal individuals have hearing thresholds that are 5 or even 10 dB below
audiometric zero at some frequencies.
Measurement of masking by ambient noise close to the threshold of
hearing requires an exceptionally quiet test environment in which the noise
can be carefully controlled, and very precise audiometry capable of detecting
small changes in threshold. Despite the difficulties, such measurements have
been made, notably in experiments at the National Physical Laboratory.
They show that unless the noise spectrum in the environment falls rapidly
with increasing frequency, only local masking need be considered at frequen-
cies above the lowest test frequency to be used for audiometry. Below this
frequency, remote masking does have to be considered, but the restrictions
on permissible noise are relatively light.
It will be evident from the foregoing discussion that limiting ambient
noise levels for audiometry cannot be defined by a single number such as
an overall sound pressure even when this is A-weighted. Instead, it is
necessary to specify the spectrum of the noise over a wide range of
frequencies. This is best done with reference to measurements in third-octave
bands because, as already stated, they correspond approximately to the
critical bands. Various recommendations have been published specifying the
maximum level of noise that can be tolerated. The most stringent are
probably those given in ISO 8253-1, yet even this standard allows the
possibility of a 2-dB error when measuring down to 0 dB HL. Correspond-
ingly lower levels would be needed for measurements below audiometric
zero (which by definition should include approximately half those on young
individuals with normal hearing). The ISO recommendations are repro-
duced, in part, in Table 9.2.

As can be seen, very low background levels are necessary for bone
conduction audiometry (and therefore for sound field audiometry). Fortu-
nately for audiologists, most measurements are made with earphones. The
earphones themselves provide useful attenuation of environmental sounds
in the mid and high frequencies, but they are quite useless in this regard at
low frequencies, where, paradoxically, they are likely to raise the threshold
Note: These levels allow pure tone thresholds to be measured by air or
bone conduction as indicated down to 0 dB HL with a maximum error
due to masking by ambient noise of 2 dB provided that the lowest test
frequency for audiometry is 250 Hz. The numbers in the fourth column
show the estimated attenuation for typical earphones (TDH-39 and
Beyer DT-48). Data in the table are taken from ISO 8253-1 (1989). The
standard should be consulted for more complete information.

of hearing by occluding the external ear.1 It will be noticed that the air
conduction limits are not, according to the authors of the ISO standard,
quite the same as the bone conduction limits plus the earphone attenuation.
When the ears are not covered (in bone conduction tests, for example),
we might expect the ambient noise limits to have approximately the same
frequency dependence as the minimum audible free field. The comparison is
made in Figure 9.4 for the frequency range 250 to 8000 Hz. This Figure
shows the limiting background noise levels given in Table 9.2 for bone
conduction audiometry and the threshold of hearing for third-octave bands
of noise heard binaurally in a diffuse sound field (ISO 389-7). The curves do
have approximately the same shape, but it may seem surprising that the
permitted ambient noise levels are greater than the hearing thresholds. The
reason is perhaps that the comparison should really be with a diffuse sound
field that is heard monaurally. Monaural thresholds are up to 3 dB less
sensitive than binaural thresholds. Also, as previously stated, tones can be
detected when the signal is 4 dB below the noise level in the critical band.
It can be seen that as the frequency is reduced below the lowest audiometric
test frequency (250 Hz), the noise limit rises more rapidly than the hearing
threshold because in this region only remote masking is involved.
^he increase in ear canal noise caused by an earphone is believed to account for a discrepancy
between the sound pressure in the ear canal when measurements are made in a free field and
the corresponding sound pressure under the cushion of an earphone. The effect, which is
present at low frequencies, remained unexplained for many years and was called 'the missing
6 dB' before Anderson and Whittle found physiological noise to be the likely cause. C. M. B.

Audiometric Test Rooms 341
Measuring Noise in Audiometric Rooms
The audiologist has to contend with two kinds of noise. One consists of
transients or at least relative short-lived disturbances, such as the sound of
footsteps of people walking near the test room, or the sound of their
conversations. Although such noise is undesirable, it is generally unlikely to
make audiometry impossible, provided that there are frequent quiet inter-
vals in which the test signals can be presented. It is the other kind of
noise â the steady backgroundâthat is the most detrimental. Background
noise has many possible sources, including noise from lighting and ventila-
tion equipment, from electrical machines and office equipment, and from
general activity in the building. Environmental sources such as distant road
traffic may also be significant, especially at low frequencies.
The measurement of low sound levels is by no means easy, and special
microphones and amplifiers are generally needed. Such equipment is not
cheap; audiologists will probably find it better to hire equipment rather than
purchase it, or to have noise surveys of their test rooms made by acoustic
specialists. The principal technical difficulty is that microphones and ampli-
fiers are not themselves entirely noise free. It can be shown that the inherent
noise in a condenser microphone is given by
where p is the root mean square sound pressure in a noise band of width
A/Hz, k is a fundamental physical constant called Boltzmann's constant
(1.38 x 10-23 J/K), T is the absolute temperature, and Ra is an acoustic
resistance. This resistance is dominated by the internal damping applied to
the microphone diaphragm. A significant reduction in microphone noise can
therefore be achieved if this damping is made smaller than normal. The
drawback is that diaphragm resonance then leads to a peak in the frequency
response. With careful design, however, this peak can be cancelled electri-
cally by an equalization circuit within the preamplifier. The best one-inch
microphones and preamplifiers achieve inherent noise levels below â10 dB
SPL in third-octave bands throughout the auditory range. The remainder
of the measuring equipment, including of course the band-pass filters, must
also be of a high quality so that it does not contribute significantly to the
overall instrument noise.
Few audiologists will have access to equipment needed to measure
ambient noise to the levels required for bone conduction tests. Fortunately,
diagnosis seldom depends on the ability to measure thresholds by bone
conduction down to audiometric zero. One can usually accept that at some
frequencies the limit may have to be somewhat higher, 10 dB HL perhaps.

342 Acoustics for Audiologists
A practical solution to the difficulty of making sound-level measurements is
to measure the hearing of otologically normal individuals. If thresholds
below 10 dB HL can be readily obtained in bone conduction audiometry,
then it is likely that the test environment is adequate for most clinical work.
Air conduction poses far less of a problem because the noise limits are
within a range that is accessible to many general-purpose sound-level
meters. It may be necessary to correct for inherent noise as described in
Chapter 6. Measurements are best made using the slow response.
The limits on ambient noise are most restrictive when audiometry is
required for reasons other than routine otological diagnosis. Research
makes obvious demands, but less academic work such as establishing local
norms for special tests will also require measurement below 0 dB HL. The
noise limits listed in Table 9.2 define a test environment that is only just
acceptable; the ideal is a test environment where threshold measurements
can be made down to â10 dB HL without reliance on attenuation by
earphone cushions. It is an objective difficult to achieve and difficult to
confirm.
Room Acoustics: Reverberation
Sound is present in any room. It comes from sources within the room and
from external sources by transmission through the walls and other bound-
aries. The sound waves are reflected endlessly by the boundaries and by
objects inside the room, but some sound energy is absorbed on each
reflection, so that if, hypothetically, all sources were removed, the sound
vibrations would decay to become indistinguishable from the random
thermal movements of the air molecules. The rate at which reflections occur
must be proportional to the speed of sound. We can therefore expect the
rate at which sound decays after sources are turned off to depend on the
speed of sound and the absorption of the reflecting surfaces. The persistence
of sound due to multiple echoes is called reverberation. The decay of sound
after sources are turned off is expressed in terms of a quantity called the
reverberation time.
If all sound sources are maintained constant, the sound pressure in the
room will reach an equilibrium value such that all sound energy entering
the room and emitted by sources within it is exactly balanced by the energy
absorbed by the internal reflections. The boundaries of the room present a
barrier to external sounds, but the sound pressure due to transmitted sound
and to internal sources is, on average, greater than it would be if the
radiation were unobstructed. This increase may be beneficial in auditoria
because less vocal effort is required of speakers for their voices to be heard,

but it is obviously undesirable in rooms intended for audiometry. The
practical solution is to line the internal surfaces with sound-absorbing
materials. If the surfaces are not absorbent, reflections will tend to produce
a sound field that is diffuse, that is, a field in which the sound energy density
is uniform and in which sound waves travel in random directions. High
absorption is therefore a requirement in audiometric rooms intended for
free-field work.
The problems of describing and predicting the acoustic properties of
enclosures are generally complex, but some useful approximations can be
made. If the absorption is relatively low, the sound field in the room will be
approximately diffuse and the reverberation time will be long. Rooms with
these characteristics are called live rooms. At the other extreme, where
absorption is high, the distribution of sound energy in the room is generally
not uniform and the reverberation time is relatively short. Such rooms are
.described as dead.
The first systematic investigation of the acoustics of enclosed spaces is
attributed to W. C. Sabine (1868-1919). He defined the reverberation time
of a room as the time required for the sound level to fall from a sensation
level of 60 dB to the threshold of hearing. This was a practical definition in
an age when many acoustic measurements relied on the listening skills of
the observer. Nowadays we would use microphones and electronic instru-
ments. The modern definition is as follows:
Reverberation time: of an enclosure, for a sound of a given frequency or
frequency band, the time that would be required for the sound pressure level
in the enclosure to decrease by 60 decibels, after the source has been stopped.
(IEC 60050).
In order to relate reverberation time to the sound absorption in the room,
suppose that the room has surfaces of areas Sl5 S2, S3,..., each having an
absorption coefficient al5 a2, a3, and so on. The absorption coefficient is
defined as the fraction of the sound power in the incident sound that is not
reflected. Unless otherwise stated, it is assumed that the coefficient is
specified for a diffuse sound field, that is, for sound incident from random
directions. Examples for various materials are given in Table 9.3.
Notice that in the definition, the sound that is 'not reflected' includes
sound transmitted as well as that physically absorbed in the surface. In
Sabine's work an open window was regarded as a perfect absorber. The
room absorption can be expressed as the area A of a perfectly absorbing
surface that provides the same sound absorption as the room itself; that is,

Note: This table gives the effective absorption coefficient. This is based on the effect of the
given material on reverberation in a diffuse sound field. It is therefore not exactly equivalent
to the acoustic energy absorbed. For strongly absorbing surfaces, the effective coefficient
is greater than the true absorption coefficient, and in some cases it is greater than 1. The
data are from manufacturers' publications and from Table 14.1 in L. E. Kinsler and A. R.
Frey. Fundamentals of Acoustics, 2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1962.
The room absorption is sometimes expressed in sabins (imperial units of
area, ft2) or in metric sabins (m2). These units are helpful because they make
it clear that the area referred to is that of the equivalent perfect absorber
rather than the actual area of the absorbing surfaces in the room.
Suppose that the sound created in the room (and entering from external
sources) amounts to an acoustic power W. It can be shown that if all sources
are turned on at time t = 0, the growth of sound intensity in the diffuse field
inside a live room is given by
where c is the velocity of sound and V is the volume of the room. It will be
seen from this, that as time passes the intensity approaches a final steady
value equal to W/A. Correspondingly, if the sound sources are turned off at
time t = 0, the subsequent fall in sound intensity from an initial value /0 is
given by

Audiometric Test Rooms 345
If we put t = T, the reverberation time, then by definition
Therefore,
Substituting numerical values with c = 343 ms 1 and rearranging gives
This is Sabine's equation for reverberation time when metric units are used.
Example
As an illustration,2 suppose that a rectangular room has the dimensions
3 x 5 x 9 metres. The volume of the room is 135 m3 and its surface area is
174 m2. If the average sound absorption coefficient is 0.1, the room
absorption A is 17.4 metric sabins. The reverberation time is therefore
After a few seconds, the sound intensity level due to a constant 10-uW
source would become
This corresponds to a sound pressure level of 58 dB re 20 uPa. The average
sound power produced in conversational speech is about 20 uW, so this
example suggests that a person's voice would be clearly audible throughout
the room. But the reverberation time is such that some speech sounds would
be masked by preceding speech sounds that had not decayed sufficiently. A
reverberation time of about 0.6 s would be acceptable.
Dead Rooms
Equation 9.2 is not valid for acoustically dead rooms. In an extreme case
where the absorption coefficient approaches unity, there should be no

reverberation at all (just as there is no reverberation outdoors). The
equation, on the other hand, gives a reverberation time of 0.161 V/S for
a surface area 5 with a = 1. The reason is that its derivation assumes that
the sound field is diffuse, which is not the case if the absorption is high. In
these circumstances alternative theories due to Eyring (and also to Norris)
apply. They lead to results that can be expressed in terms of an average
absorption coefficient, known as the Eyring absorption coefficient, which is
calculated as
where S = S1 + S2 + S3 +..., 
the total surface area in the room.
The equations previously given for a live room now apply if A is replaced
by
The Eyring reverberation time is therefore given by
Example
An audiometric test room has a square floor measuring 3 x 3 metres, and
its walls are 2.5 metres high. The carpeted floor has an absorption coefficient
of 0.3 at 500 Hz; the ceiling and walls are lined with acoustic panels for
which the absorption coefficients are respectively 0.55 and 0.70 at this
frequency. What reverberation time is expected for sounds whose frequen-
cies are in the neighbourhood of 500 Hz?
The working is as follows:
Floor 
area 9m2 
a = 0.30 
aS = 2.70 m2
Ceiling 
area 9 m2 
a = 0.55 
aS = 4.95 m2
Walls 
area 30m2 
a = 0.70 
aS = 21.0m2
Total surface area = 48 m2
Room volume = 22.5 m3
SaS = 2.7 + 4.95 + 21.0 = 28.65 m2
Mean absorption coefficient = 28.65/48 = 0.597
Reverberation time = 0.161 x 22.5/[â48 x ln(l -0-597)] = 0-083 seconds

Audiometric Test Rooms 
347
According to design criteria recommended some years ago in the United
Kingdom,3 the reverberation time in audiometric rooms should be less than
250 ms for frequencies below 1 kHz, and less than 200 ms at higher
frequencies. The preceding calculation suggests that these criteria are not
too difficult to achieve with modern sound-absorbing materials. In a
good-quality audiometric room the reverberation time is likely to be less
than 100 ms at frequencies from 1 kHz upwards, and typically 240, 190, and
100 ms at 125, 250, and 500 Hz, respectively.
Measuring Reverberation Time
We are offered the following caution:
Reverberation time T is defined as the length of time in seconds it takes for
the energy in the steady-state sound field in a room to decay by 60 dB after
the source of the sound excitation is suddenly turned off. The simplicity of this
definition vanishes when one begins the process of physically measuring T.4
The problem is that a great many modes of vibration are possible within an
enclosure, and although all modes decay exponentially when the source is
turned off, they do so at different rates. At any instant the distribution of
sound in the room is a complex pattern created by the interference of
numerous vibrations of different frequency and phase. As the sound decays,
the pattern changes in ways that are generally unpredictable, so that at any
point in the field the time course of the decay is irregular. Nevertheless, it is
usually sufficiently regular to permit meaningful measurement, especially if
filters are used to restrict observations to a small band of frequencies.
Within a specified band, suppose that the sound decays exponentially,
that is,
where p is the sound pressure at time t, pQ is the sound pressure at the start
of observations at time t = 0, and n is a constant. It is assumed that the
decay is slow compared with the period of the sound vibrations within the
band. It is then meaningful to represent sound pressure by a root mean
square value where the average is taken over a time that is short compared
with 1/n but long enough to smooth out statistical fluctuations in sound

pressure. From the exponential relationship, it follows that
where pr is the reference pressure, 20 ^Pa. If, therefore, the decay of the
reverberation is a smooth exponential, a graph of sound pressure level
against time will be a straight line whose negative slope in decibels per
second is equal to the term in the parentheses. Reverberation time T is then
given by
An example of a smooth exponential decay is shown in Figure 9.5. An
irregular decay is shown in Figure 9.6.
The traditional method for measuring reverberation time was to plot the
decay curve using a high-speed sound-level recorder in conjunction with a
sound-level meter and filters. Mechanical recorders are now obsolete be-
cause modern equipment provides real-time digital analysis and data
storage, allowing the decay curve to be held in memory and displayed or
printed as required. The initial sound field is generated either by a random

noise source or by an impulsive source such as a starting pistol. The
response time of the measuring equipment has, of course, to be considerably
shorter than the reverberation time being measured. With simple exponen-
tial averaging (see Chapter 6), the meter indication falls at a rate determined
by the discharge of the capacitor after the signal has been turned off.
Expressed in decibels per second, this rate is
In contrast to this, the sound field decays at 60/T dB/s. The averaging time
has to be less than a twentieth of reverberation time for a satisfactory
performance.
Audiometric Rooms
Audiologists, particularly if they work in hospitals, usually have to accept
the test environment provided for them, but on rare occasions, perhaps
when planning a new building, their views may be sought. When designing

350 Acoustics for Audiologists
test rooms, it is generally advisable to seek the advice of acoustic consultants
or companies that specialize in the construction of acoustic rooms. Archi-
tects undoubtedly have some knowledge of acoustics, but they are unlikely
to be experts. It is difficultâperhaps impossibleâto remedy acoustic faults
once the building has been constructed, so appropriate consultation and
careful planning are worth the effort and expense.
Some general considerations may influence decisions at the planning
stage. The first is that structure-borne vibration is often the worst enemy,
whose defeat requires the test room to be located (so far as one has a choice)
well away from obvious sources of vibration such as lift shafts and plant
rooms. Isolation from structural vibration can be accomplished by a
room-within-a-room construction in which the test room itself is contained
within a brick or concrete enclosure, separated from it by an air gap and, if
possible, supported on antivibration mountings. Airborne sound is transmit-
ted by passing vibrations through the walls, floor, and ceiling of the test
room. It is therefore imperative that these structures have high mass and
rigidity in order to impede their vibration. Good test rooms are made of
heavy-gauge steel sheets that form a double skin. The gap may be filled with
mineral wool, which is both dense and acoustically absorbent. Windows, if
they have to be present at all, should be double or triple glazed. Doors must
be heavy and must seal firmly. Ventilation, a necessity for the occupants, is
potentially fatal to the acoustics, but fortunately, well-designed silencers are
very effective. Interior surfaces must absorb sound effectively. Apart from
reducing the general sound level in the room, high absorption will inhibit
the formation of standing waves. This will be important if the room is
intended for sound field audiometry. Nowadays there are many companies
offering acoustic lining materials that are both excellent sound absorbers
and pleasing to the eye. Rooms made to order by specialist firms are
probably best, but if responsibility has to be given to general builders and
architects, they would be well advised to attend to the foregoing principles.

Hearing Aids: Basic Electroacoustic
Characteristics
The measurement of the acoustic characteristics of a hearing aid is central
to hearing aid technology. Audiologists must be able to understand manu-
facturers' data sheets and be able to use test equipment effectively. This
chapter is intended as a brief introduction to what is involved. An extensive
literature describing all aspects of hearing aid design and performance is
available; although many of the books and research papers on the subject
are written for experts, there are many accounts that will be readily
accessible to the more general reader. Some suggestions are given at the end
of this chapter.
In an attempt to alleviate the burden of deafness, a hearing aid has to
perform two functions: it has to raise the level of sound reaching the ear so
that the threshold of hearing is exceeded and audibility is restored, and it
has to modify the acoustic signal in ways that compensate as far as possible
for defects in the ear's analytical capacity. Amplification is relatively easy to
accomplish, but compensation for impaired auditory processing is very
difficult indeedâin some cases even impossible. The problem is deep
rooted. It is, perhaps, that we learn to understand the world of sound at a
very early age (some even suggest that the process begins before birth), but
once the 'code' has been learnt, the learning cannot easily be repeated.
Familiar signals become difficult to interpret when degraded by sensory
impairment, and often the new representation of the auditory environment
that a hearing aid can provide is just as difficult to understand. With digital
processing, the technology now exists to modify the incoming acoustic
signal in almost any way we wish. The difficulty is that no one knows quite
what modifications should be made. New strategies continue to be tried, and
although at times they offer great promise, more often than not they achieve
only marginal results. It may be an act of faith to believe that a way will be
found to deliver clear speech to a damaged ear, but so far we have seen only
stumbling progress in this regard. On the other hand, there have been great
technical advances in the construction and electroacoustic performance of
hearing aids. The technology has culminated in the development and mass
production of truly wearable devices that operate for long periods using
353

only a miniature cell as the power source, producing, if required, sound
outputs at levels on the limit of what is physiologically acceptable.
It may be fashionable to deride 'analogue' types, and they may one
day give way entirely to the new digital instruments, but even analogue
circuits are capable of important forms of signal processing, particularly in
shaping the frequency response of the aid and in regulating its output. But
whatever the technology, all hearing aids produce an amplified version of
the sound at their input. The characterization and measurement of this
process has a well-established importance in hearing aid technology and
rehabilitative audiology. In the brief account that follows, most descriptions
have a certain general validity but apply particularly to analogue hearing
aids because universal test methods for digital aids have yet to be developed.
Some characteristics, such as gain, are meaningful regardless of the technol-
ogy, but others will probably become obsolete in the digital era.
Standard Tests of Gain, Output,
and Frequency Response
Test methods are specified in the various parts of the international standard
IEC 60118, but readers, particularly those in the United States and Canada,
should be aware that parts of the international standard are not technically
compatible with the American standard, ANSI S3.22 (1987). The American
hearing aid industry has made a major contribution to hearing aid technol-
ogy, and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), under the
auspices of the Acoustical Society of America, plays an important part in
acoustic metrology and standardization. It is therefore regrettable that
despite efforts to harmonize the ANSI and IEC standards, technical diiferen-
ces remain.1 In what follows, however, we will make direct reference only to
the IEC standard.
The introduction to part 0 of the IEC standard reads as follows:
The object of this standard is to describe methods of measurement for the
evaluation of the electroacoustical characteristics of hearing aids.
The methods are chosen first of all to be practical and reproducible, and
consequently they are based on fixed parameters chosen, to a certain extent,
arbitrarily. This should be taken into consideration when comparisons are
1or a discussion, see D. A. Preves. Standardizing hearing aid measurement parameters and
electroacoustic performance tests. In Hearing Aids: Standards, Options and Limitations, ed. M.
Valente. Thieme Medical Publishers, New York, 1996. Revisions of IEC 60118-7 bring this
standard very close to ANSI S3.22, and work is in progress to further harmonize the
international and American standards.

being made between test results for hearing aids of different models and
manufacturer, and in each case it is advisable to examine to what extent the
arbitrarily chosen parameters will influence the comparison of such test
results.
In general, the test methods relate the sound pressure in a free field in which
the aid is placed and the sound pressure developed by the aid in an
occluded-ear simulator (IEC 60711). The use of the simulator is important
because it facilitates comparison between different hearing aids. The same
methods can be applied when a 2-cc coupler (IEC 60126) is used, and
manufacturers usually supply performance data for both devices. Compari-
sons based on coupler data are less reliable and the data give a less
satisfactory indication of the likely performance when the aid is worn by a
real subject. The coupler is, however, a more robust and far less expensive
instrument than the ear simulator and is considered adequate for quality
inspection as described in part 7 of IEC 60118. Further information about
the ear simulator and acoustic coupler can be obtained from the relevant
standards and from the descriptions in Chapters 7 and 8.
One of the most important characteristics of a hearing aid is its gain, so
we need a clear understanding at the outset exactly what this term means.
In its most general sense, gain is the ratio of some physical quantity at the
output of a device to the same quantity at the input. We can therefore speak
of voltage gain, current gain, power gain, pressure gain, and so on. When
describing the performance of an electronic amplifier, gain usually means
voltage gain; in hearing aid technology, it usually means the gain in sound
pressure. It is standard practice to express the voltage gain of an amplifier
and the sound pressure gain of a hearing aid in decibels. The gain G in
decibels is then given by
where V0 and V{ are the output and input voltages of an amplifier and p0
and pj are the output and input sound pressures of a hearing aid. These
formulae apply only to sinusoidal signals, so that values of gain are
necessarily frequency specific. Moreover, a sinusoidal input will give rise to
a sinusoidal output only if the relationship between output and input is
linear. It is not meaningful to talk about the gain of a hearing aid if its
operation is nonlinear. By nonlinear we mean here that a sinusoidal input
leads to a nonsinusoidal output. This is the kind of nonlinearity associated
with peak clipping. On the other hand, automatic gain control and com-
pression (to be described later) do preserve the waveform and do allow gain
to be expressed according to the preceding definitions.

356 Acoustics for Audologists
The voltages and pressures in the gain formulae will normally be
expressed as root mean square values, but because ratios are involved, other
corresponding values such as peak values (amplitudes) are equally valid. It
may be noted that the logarithm is multiplied by 20 on the assumption that
the gain is equivalent to a power gain proportional to the square of the
voltage or pressure ratio. In general, the electrical impedance at the output
of an amplifier is not the same as that at its input, and the acoustic
impedance at the output to a hearing aid is not the same as the acoustic
impedance at its microphone. Accordingly, the squared voltage or pressure
ratios are not identical to the corresponding ratios of electrical or acoustic
power. But the gain formulae are retained because they provide logarithmic
conversions that are highly convenient and widely used even if they are not
true to the ideal definition of the decibel.
The gain of a hearing aid has to be specified for its manufacture and
testing, and it has to be known in order to predict the acoustic performance
that the aid will have when it is worn. When gain is measured according to
the standard test methods, the input to the hearing aid is derived from what
is essentially a free field. The field is usually generated by a loudspeaker
within a small enclosure lined with sound-absorbing material. The sound
pressure is measured at a specified test point in the field. A reference point
on the hearing aid is nominated, and the gain of the aid is determined when
the aid is placed in the sound field with the reference point at the test point.
The orientation of the aid has to be specified; the standard reference
orientation corresponds to the orientation that the aid would have when
worn by a person facing the sound source. The gain of the aid is defined as
follows:
Acoustic gain â at a specified frequency and under specified operating condi-
tions, the difference between the sound pressure level developed in the ear
simulator by the hearing aid and the sound pressure level measured at the test
point.
Four methods of specifying the input sound level are provided in the IEC
standard:
Substitution method: The hearing aid and the microphone used to
measure the free-field sound pressure are alternately placed at the same
point in the field
Comparison method: The hearing aid and the measuring microphone
are placed at acoustically equivalent points in the field
Pressure method: The sound pressure is controlled at a point close to
the sound entry to the hearing aid by a controlling microphone

Hearing Aids: Basic Electroacoustic Characteristics 
357
Simulated in situ method: The hearing aid is mounted on an artificial
head and torso to simulate the diffraction that occurs when the aid is
worn
The pressure method (as used in a hearing aid test box) is probably the one
best known to audiologists. Because the sound pressure is controlled at a
point close to the microphone of the aid, the effect of diffraction by the aid
itself is eliminated. At the other extreme, the in situ method provides as
complete a simulation as possible of the performance of the aid when it is
worn by an average adult user. In this situation diffraction does matter and
is an inherent part of the test procedure. Provisional specifications for a
head-and-torso simulator are given in IEC 60959.2
Step-by-step instructions on how to measure the gain and output of a
hearing aid are given in Section 7 of IEC 60118-0. Acoustic gain will
normally be measured over a range of frequencies. When the measurements
are made as a function of frequency, the input sound pressure is held
constant at a level, usually 50 or 60 dB SPL, consistent with a linear
response. The volume control should be turned full on and the settings of
other controls should be stated. Gain measured in this way is called full-on
gain, and the curve describing its frequency dependence is best called the
full-on gain response curve.
If we want to measure the output of a hearing aid, it is usually neces-
sary to set the gain in some standard way. The standard gain is estab-
lished at what is called the reference test frequency. The reference frequency
is normally 1600 Hz, but for some high-tone hearing aids 2500 Hz is
preferred. The standard gain at the reference frequency is called the reference
test gain. The first step in setting this gain is to measure the output of
the aid in response to a high-level input. The input specified for this
task is a tone having a level of 90 dB SPL at the reference frequency.
The measurement is made with the volume control full on and other
controls set to give the greatest available output. The output so obtained
is called the OSPL^. It is the limiting output that occurs when the
aid is operating under nonlinear conditions beyond its normal working
range. To find the reference test gain, the input is now reduced to 60 dB
SPL (at the reference frequency). If the output has decreased by less than
8 dB, the volume control should be adjusted to bring the output to 15 dB
below OSPL90; otherwise, the adjustment should set the output to 7 dB
below the full-on value. This procedure for establishing the reference test
gain may seem slightly complicated, but it has the virtue of putting the
2A widely used simulator is known as KEMAR, an acronym for Knowles Electronics Manikin
for Acoustic Research. The head, which is hollow, contains the ear simulator.

358 Acoustics for Audologists
hearing aid in a condition that is comfortably within its intended oper-
ational range.3
Having set the volume control as described, and with other controls set
for maximum gain, the frequency can be varied while holding the input level
constant at 60 dB SPL. With this input, the curve showing the way the
output of the aid depends on frequency is called the basic frequency-response
curve. Similar curves can be obtained for different input levels to give a
family of response curves that illustrate the performance of the aid over its
entire range of operation. In addition to the output curves obtained at the
reference test gain, manufacturers usually provide a curve showing the
OSPL90 as a function of frequency. This curve therefore shows the output
of the aid in response to a 90-dB input when the volume control is set full
on and when other controls are set for maximum gain. It usually represents
the maximum output that can be obtained from the aid.
Manufacturers generally provide data consistent with either the recom-
mendations of the IEC or ANSI, but there are minor variations in the way
results are presented. For example, some manufacturers label as 'frequency
response' curves that show the variation of gain with frequency, whereas
others apply this name to the variation of output with frequency. It is
usually obvious which measure is being used because the difference, which
is equal to the input sound pressure level, is quite a large number of decibels
(typically 60 dB). Note that gain curves are valid only for linear operation,
but this restriction does not apply to output measures. With automatic gain
control circuits disabled, essentially linear input-output conditions are said
to exist if a 10-dB change in the input level leads to the same change in the
output level (+1 dB) at any frequency in the range 200 to 8000 Hz.
Examples of typical gain and output characteristics are shown in Figure
10.1. The frequency response is designed with the following in mind: it
should bring the output to a level that is comfortably between the threshold
of hearing and the level that the user will find too loud, it should reduce the
masking of medium-frequency and high-frequency components by stronger
components at lower frequencies, and it should emphasize those compo-
nents that contribute most to speech intelligibility. A typical response
establishes an output that rises at about 12 dB per octave from 200 to 1000
Hz. Above 1000 Hz the response is likely to be approximately uniform
except for peaks and valleys associated with the acoustics of the ear and its
acoustic coupling to the hearing aid. At the high-frequency end of the range,
usually from 3500 Hz, the response falls rapidly. Many users have little
serviceable hearing at these frequencies, and in any event the high-frequency
3The procedure described here follows Amendment Al (1994) of IEC 60118-0. The previous
version required the volume control to be placed in the full-on position if an output 15 dB
below OSPL90 could not be achieved. The 7-dB excess was not required.

components above 3500 Hz contribute little to speech intelligibility. Some
authorities, however, are in favour of extending the working range to higher
frequencies.
Output-Limiting Methods
The great majority of hearing aid users have sensory hearing impairments
that are almost always accompanied by loudness recruitment. This means
that although the threshold of hearing is abnormally high, loudness in-

360 Acoustics for Audologists
creases rapidly with sound level once threshold is exceeded. If the output of
the hearing aid is not carefully controlled, strong signals are likely to
produce an output that is uncomfortably loud.
The output of any amplifier is ultimately limited by the supply voltage
and the range over which the circuit components are able to function
normally. If the input signal is increased, there comes a point where no
further increase in output is possible. The amplifier is then said to be
saturated. In a simple amplifier without automatic gain control, peak
clipping occurs as saturation is approached. Peak clipping is often intro-
duced deliberately as a way of controlling the output of a hearing aid. In its
simplest form, this type of control produces an output waveform that is an
amplified version of the input waveform below a limiting level. Peaks in the
waveform that would exceed this level are removed so that the output is held
constant at the limit for the duration of the peak (see Chapter 5, Figure
5.15). Peak-clipped signals are obviously distorted and they sound 'fuzzy' to
the normal ear, but despite this, the intelligibility of speech signals may not
be severely degraded. The advantage of peak clipping over other methods
of output control is that its action is instantaneous. The user is therefore
well protected against the occurrence of unexpectedly intense sounds in the
environment. The disadvantage is that information contained in clipped
portions of the waveform is lost.
The alternative to peak clipping is automatic gain control (AGC).4 As the
name suggests, this method can be used to regulate the output of an
amplifier by varying its gain according to the level of the signal at some
point in the system. Automatic gain control has had a long history. It was
probably first used in radiotelephony to compensate for unintended changes
in the strength of the carrier signal arriving at the receiver. With amplitude
modulation, the amplitude of the audio signal is directly proportional to the
amplitude of the carrier, so that control of the carrier level is advantageous.
Many varieties of automatic gain control have been tried in hearing aids. In
all cases it is necessary to sample the signal at some point in the amplifier
to obtain a voltage that represents the average signal level. This voltage is
then passed back to a control circuit that regulates the gain in some way.
The simplest form of control is one that attempts to maintain a constant
average level at the sampling point. This may be ideal in a radio receiver
but would be inappropriate in a hearing aid because it would deprive the
user of the natural variation in environmental sound level that should be
experienced. In a quiet environment, the gain would become excessive and
4Another term for AGC is compression. Some authorities and some manufacturers make a
distinction between these terms and reserve AGC for the description of compression that is
characterized by a low compression threshold and a high compression ratio. Others use the
terms synonymously.

FIG. 10.2 Generalized input-output function for a hearing aid with automatic gain
control (compression).
the output would be heavily contaminated with noise generated by the
amplifier itself. Hearing aid gain control is far more sophisticated. It
generally allows unrestricted linear amplification to a specified level (the
so-called knee point or compression threshold5). Above this level the gain is
progressively reduced as a limiting output is approached. It should be
understood that it is the average signal that is limited. Gain control, unlike
peak clipping, allows the audio-frequency variation in the magnitude of the
output signal to continue under all conditions. Unless the averaging time of
the control circuit is so short as to be commensurate with the period of
audio-frequency components, the output of the amplifier will remain undis-
torted.
The input-output characteristics of a hearing aid can be shown graphi-
cally, plotting the sound pressure level at the input on the horizontal scale
and the corresponding sound pressure level at the output on the vertical
scale (Figure 10.2). Let LI and L0 be the input and output sound levels. The
gain of the hearing aid is L0 - L{ decibels at any point on the input-output
curve. This difference is constant when the gain is constant. For this
condition, a change in the number of decibels at the input is matched by the
same decibel change at the output. The corresponding input-output function
5ANSI S3.22 defines compression threshold as the input level at which the input-output function
falls 2 dB below the value it would have in the absence of compression, that is, 2 dB below
the projection of the linear portion of the function.

362 Acoustics for Audologists
is therefore a straight line whose slope is unity. Elsewhere the function is a
straight line of lesser slope or not a straight line at all. If it is a curve, its
slope diminishes as the input level is raised and the difference between L0
and LJ becomes progressively smaller. The reciprocal of the slope of the
input-output function is called the compression ratio. Accordingly, the
change in input level for a given change in output level defines the
compression ratio in a given region of the input-output function as
change in input level
compression ratio = â 
: 
â-
change in output level
it being understood that the changes are small such that the slope of the
input-output function is essentially constant over the range of sound levels
for which the value of the compression ratio is required.
The range over which output signals are usable by the listener defines the
dynamic range in which the hearing aid should operate. The hearing aid
response needed to bring a given range of input signals within the dynamic
range of the user depends on both the compression threshold and the
compression ratio. The choice of these parameters is likely to be determined
by the personal preferences of the audiologist and the user.
Automatic gain control (compression) requires a control voltage that is
derived from an average value of the signal at some point in the amplifier.
The average can be obtained by rectifying the signal and smoothing it with
a low-pass filter to obtain a representative dc level. The averaging time is
important because it determines the speed at which the amplifier will react
to changes in signal level. A rapid response is needed to protect the user
from the discomfort that would be caused by a sudden increase in input, but
a long response time gives a stable Output that is free from intrusive changes
in level. The conflict between these requirements is resolved by allowing a
slow response under normal conditions while imposing a rapid response
whenever a sudden large increase in the signal is encountered. The shorter
time constant is called the attack time. It can be determined by abruptly
increasing the level of a previously steady input from 55 to 80 dB SPL and
measuring the time needed for the output to stabilize within 2 dB of its final
value. The longer time constant is called the release time. It is measured as
the time needed for the output to return within 2 dB of its steady state
following a sudden fall in input from 80 to 55 dB SPL. Attack and release
times are typically in the range 10 to 50 ms and 150 to 2000 ms, respectively,
but some hearing aids incorporate systems that respond more rapidly to
give what is called syllabic compression (attack less than 5 ms, release 10 to
100 ms).

Hearing Aids: Basic Electroacoustic Characteristics 363
It should be noted that the compression characteristics of a hearing aid
amplifier are likely to depend on frequency because the underlying fre-
quency response is deliberately nonuniform. Moreover, some hearing aids
are designed for multichannel operation. They filter the incoming signal to
separate its components into two or more channels according to frequency.
The channels work independently to apply different gains and different
output characteristics before their outputs are combined in the final stage of
the amplifier. The aim is to improve the compensation for sensory hearing
loss. This type of hearing loss is strongly dependent on frequency and, in
theory at least, is best aided by applying different amplification characteris-
tics in different parts of the spectrum.
The place in the amplifier where gain control is applied is important.
There are two principal options. In the first of these the sampling and the
gain control are established before the volume control to give what is called
input compression. The action of the volume control is then to displace the
input-output function vertically. The knee point therefore occurs at the same
input level for all settings of the control (Figure 10.3). The other com-
monly used method is called output compression. In this configuration, the
signal is sampled in the output stage of the amplifier, and the feedback is

Input-controlled compression.

364 Acoustics for Audologists

taken to one of the first stages, where the gain control is effected. Changing
the volume control displaces the input-output function parallel to the
horizontal axis, but the output level at the knee-point remains the same
(Figure 10.4).
Distortion
The IEC recommendation is that distortion should be measured with the
volume control set to produce the reference test gain. The position of other
controls should be stated. They should preferably be set to give the widest
bandwidth.
Harmonic distortion is measured with a test tone at 70 dB SPL in the
frequency range 200 to 5000 Hz. For each frequency of the test tone, the
levels of components at the harmonic frequencies can be measured using
filters or a frequency analyser. The harmonic distortion at each frequency
and the total harmonic distortion can then be calculated as described in
Chapters 5 and 8.

Hearing Aids: Basic Electroacoustic Characteristics 365
Portable test equipment (hearing aid test boxes) usually provides tests of
harmonic distortion. The results are often misinterpreted. A quiet test
environment is essential because environmental noise can produce signifi-
cant sound levels in the output of the aid in frequency bands containing the
harmonics. Self-generated noise in the hearing aid may be similarly misin-
terpreted.
Intermodulation distortion may also be measured. It is recommended that
two test tones, each at 64 dB SPL, should be used as the input. The tones
should have frequencies fÂ± and /2 such that the difference /2 â f{ = 125 Hz,
though other differences are acceptable. The principal distortion products to
be measured are those with frequencies /2 â /A and 2/2 â /2, where /2 is in
the range 475 to 5000 Hz.
Harmonic and intermodulation distortion are related, but it generally is
difficult to derive one from the other.
Internal Noise
Internal noise is unlikely to be a problem for the hearing aid user. It will
probably be inaudible unless the gain is set to a high level and the aid is worn
in a quiet environment. Internal noise should be measured at the reference test
frequency or in third-octave bands with centre frequencies in the range 200 to
5000 Hz. Internal noise is expressed as an equivalent external noise at the
input to the hearing aid. This is done by measuring, in the ear simulator, the
output caused by internal noise and then subtracting the gain of the hearing
aid. The procedure is as follows. The volume control is set at approximately
the reference gain position, but the setting is not critical. The aid is then
presented with an input signal, which should be a tone at 60 dB SPL, either at
the reference test frequency (1600 Hz) or at the centre frequency of the band
being examined. It is important to have the aid operating in a region where the
input-output characteristic is linear. This means that the input must be below
the level at which automatic gain control (if present) becomes active. If
necessary a test level below 60 dB should be used. It is also important, as with
distortion measurements, that ambient noise does not contribute significantly
to the sound levels measured at the output.
Using the notation in IEC 60118, let Ls be the sound pressure level in the
ear simulator when the test tone is on and let L2 be the level when it is off.
Let L! be the level of the test tone. It may be assumed that internal noise
makes a negligible contribution to Ls so that the gain of the aid is simply
Ls â L1. The internal noise referred to the input of the aid is then L^, where

Hearing aids used by children in schools for the deaf often take their input
directly from a radio receiver or by magnetic induction from a neck loop or
a loop system in the classroom. Advice on appropriate test methods should
be sought from the hearing aid manufacturers and from the relevant
standards (IEC 60118 parts 2 and 6).

Appendix A
Supplementary Mathematics
This appendix provides help with those elements of mathematics that occur
frequently in the text or that are needed for special purposes. A knowledge
of mathematical notation and simple algebra is assumed. Particular effort
should be given to understanding the sine function because it is an almost
indispensable part of acoustics. An understanding of exponentials and
logarithms is also important, particularly as applied to decibel units. Help
in working with decibels is given in Appendix B. It is anticipated that
readers who consult the appendices will have different requirements. The
technical difficulty is not uniform. Some parts deal with simple matters such
as scientific notation, while others are concerned with more difficult issues
such as trigonometric functions and complex numbers. There is no intention
to develop a mathematical theme; topics are for the most part presented
arbitrarily in alphabetical order. The result is something of a ready refer-
ence. Where a more thorough treatment is needed, the reader is encouraged
to consult mathematics textbooks.

Angles
An angle expresses the inclination of one straight line to another straight
line in the same plane. An angle is generated when a line is rotated about a
fixed point. The usual convention is to give a positive sign to an angle
produced by an anticlockwise rotation and a negative sign to one produced
by a clockwise rotation. For everyday purposes we usually measure angles
in degrees, 360Â° being equal to the anticlockwise rotation that returns the
line to its initial direction. The degree is a valuable unit, not only because
we are so used to it, but because it conveniently expresses commonly used
fractions of a circle in whole numbers. For example, a quarter of a circle is
90Â°; 5 minutes on a clock face is 30Â°, and the angular speed of the earth's
rotation is 15Â° per hour.
For all its virtues, a degree is a quite arbitrary unit,1 which is its downfall
so far as mathematics is concerned. To see the problem, consider the
following statement,2 which is true for all values of x:
Because the exponents of x differ from one term to the next, this expansion
of sinx is only possible if x is dimensionless, that is, just a number,
independent of the units of measurement. We therefore have to define a unit
angle as the ratio of like quantities, and the obvious choice is the ratio of
two lengths. The scientific unit is the radian, which is defined as the ratio of
the circumference of a circle to its radius. Because the circumference is 2n
times the radius, a complete rotation generates an angle of 2n radians. One
Another arbitrary unit is the grad, which divides the circle into 400 parts. The distance over
the earth's surface measured along the arc of a great circle is 60 nautical miles for an angle of
1Â° and 100 km for an angle of 1 grad.
2The exclamation marks denote factorials; for example, 3! = 3 x 2 x 1, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, and
so forth.

Appendix A 371
radian is equivalent to 360/27T = 57-3Â°. If r is the radius of a circle and s the
length of an arc subtending the angle 6 radians, then
as shown in Figure A.I.
Angular Frequency
If a point P moves with constant speed v around the circumference of a
circle, the angle between the radius to P and a fixed line OX will increase
at the constant rate v/r radians per second (Figure A.2). The rate of change
of angle is called angular velocity. It is usually represented by the letter a>.
In acoustics, as distinct from the physics of rotating bodies, angular velocity
is associated with the frequency of harmonic oscillation, and the term
angular frequency is used instead. The angular frequency is the rate of
change of angle needed to achieve one complete revolution in the time of
one cycle of oscillation.
FIG. A.2 Angular velocity.

372 Acoustics for Audiologists
Exponents
Writing a million as 106 is a convenient shorthand, as is writing a3 for
ax ax a. In the term a", the number n (that is, the power to which a has
been raised) is called an exponent.
The rules governing the operation of exponents are as follows:
a" x am = a(n+m) 
Exponents are added when terms involving powers of
the same variable are multiplied.
a"/am = a(n~m) 
Exponents are subtracted when terms involving powers
of the same variable are divided.
aÂ° = 1 
Any number raised to the power zero is equal to unity
[1 = a"/a" = a(n~n) = a0].
a~" = I/a" 
A negative exponent indicates that the reciprocal of
the number is required.
ai/n = ^/a 
The exponent is a fraction. The denominator is n,
showing that the nth root should be taken.
am/n = [>ya]m 
The numerator is m, showing that the nth root must
be raised to the power m.
Exponential Functions
If an equation has the form j; = a* where x is a variable and a is a constant,
we say that y is an exponential function of x. An important special case exists
for the function ex, where the mathematical constant e is a number which,
like TT, is known in the limit but which can never be evaluated exactly (i.e.,
a transcendental number). The function is called the exponential function. It
is often written as exp(x). The number e is given by
and
The functions ex and e x are shown in Figure A.3. A very important
property of the exponential function is that the rate of increase of ex with x
is itself equal to ex. If we draw a straight line _y = mx + c through a point

Appendix A 373
(xls yt) on the curve y = ex, we find that the slope m of the line is exi. The
same is true for the function e~x. This function decreases as x increases; the
rate of increase is â e~x. Exponential functions occur frequently in physics
and biology because it often happens that the rate of change of 'X' is
proportional to 'X\ For example, the rate at which an organism grows is,
at least initially, proportional to how big it is. In radioactive processes, the
number of nuclear disintegrations per second must be proportional to the
number of nondisintegrated nuclei remaining, so that if the disintegrations
are counted, the change in the count rate with time is proportional to the
prevailing count rate.
Figure A.4 shows the functions 1 â e~t/r and e~t/T, where t represents time
and T is a constant known as the time constant. Examples are abundant: the
rise or decay of the charge on a capacitor through a series resistance
following a step change in the applied voltage, and the increase or decrease
in amplitude of a forced harmonic vibration following a step change in the
level of the driving force are described by these functions.
Functions
When we first learn to use algebra, we are told that constants and variables
can be represented by letters of the alphabet. The value of this representa-
tion is that general relationships can be explored without the need to work
with specific numerical values. Here is a simple example. Let h and w be the
height and width of a rectangle whose perimeter and area are respectively
P and S. Then P = 2(h + w) and 5 = kw. Therefore,

374 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. A.4 Exponential growth and decay functions.
What is important here is that the ratio of the area to the perimeter of any
rectangle is given by this formula. A valuable benefit of the algebraic form
is that it becomes easy to manipulate the formulae to arrive at new ways of
expressing the same ideas. If, for example, we replace w by S/h, we find that
p = 2(h + S/h). Now if, instead of a rectangle, we had chosen an isosceles
triangle of height h, we would have arrived at the formula
The area within a regular hexagon can be divided into six isosceles triangles.
If we stand the hexagon on one of its sides, its height h is twice that of each
of the triangles. The formula for the perimeter in terms of the area is
P = 4S/h.
The three formulae just given are all different, which is not surprising
because they apply to the three differently shaped figures that we have
described, but they do have one thing in common. They each give the
perimeter of the figure in terms of its area and one specified dimension. It
can therefore be said of rectangles, symmetrical triangles, and regular
hexagons that the perimeter can be calculated if the height and area are
known. This truth can be expressed symbolically by saying that the

Appendix A 375
perimeter is a function of area and height and writing this as
This simply states that P depends on S and h without telling us exactly what
the dependence is. Unless we know more about the function f, we cannot
calculate P from S and h. We have used the letter / as a name for the
function (because it reminds us of the word function), but any letter would
do as well, including the letter P itself. We could represent the perimeter of
one of these figures by P(S, h) and give the function a name such as
'perimeter function'.
Functions are usually printed as a name or a letter followed by parenth-
eses. The terms within the parentheses constitute the argument of the
function. An argument can be a single variable, a list of variables separated
by commas, or an algebraic expression. For example, the particle displace-
ment ^ in a progressive acoustic wave is given variously as
and
where c is the speed of sound, x the distance from the source, and t the time.
Notice that the second expression supplies more information than the first
by telling us that particle displacement really depends on the value of ct â x
rather than the individual values of c, t, and x. We could replace this
argument with a single variable (call it d, where d = ct â x) and write
* = /(<*)â¢
It is important to understand that when a function is evaluated, each
component of the argument is treated in its entirety as though it were a
single variable. For example, suppose we have a function g(x) such that
Then
and
Simplified Notation for Functions
When using computers to evaluate standard or user-defined functions, it is
nearly always necessary to include the opening and closing parentheses

376 Acoustics for Audiologists
around the arguments. In printed text, however, the algebra often looks less
cluttered if the parentheses are omitted. Their omission is perfectly accept-
able provided that the result is correct and unambiguous. For example,
sin(x) can be written as sin x, but sin(x + </>) cannot be written as sin x + </>
because this would be confused with sin(x) + </>. On the other hand,
multiplication or division can bind terms to the function name when
parentheses are omitted. For example, Iog(p1/p2) can be written as log pjp2-

mean the same thing.
Inverse Functions
Suppose that y is a function of x. Then we can find y given x. The inverse
problem is to find x when we are given y. The function of y that gives us x
is said to be the inverse of the function of x that gives us y. Suppose, for
example, that there is a function called P(x) whose inverse is Q(y) such that
Then if y = P(x),
In this example, as often happens, the inverse function does not give a
unique value. Inverse functions are important in trigonometry, where they
sometimes have special names. For example, arctan x is the inverse of
tanx. Because tan n/4 = 1, arctan(l) = n/4. It also has other values (see the
section Trigonometric Functions later in this appendix.)
Imaginary and Complex Numbers
The numbers that we use in normal arithmetic and in the description of
physical events are called real numbers. In ordinary arithmetic and ordinary

Appendix A 377
algebra a positive number multipled by itself is positive, and a negative
number multiplied by itself is also positive. There is therefore no real
number whose square is negative; the square roots of negative real numbers
do not exist. But suppose that the roots of negative numbers can exist â
they are called imaginary. Imaginary numbers may have started life as a
mathematical curiosity, but they are now an indispensible part of mathemat-
ical analysis and of great importance in all branches of physcial science.
It is customary3 to use the letter i or j to represent the positive square
root of â 1, that is,
and
A number formed by adding a real number and an imaginary number is
called a complex number. A complex number Z can be written as
where a and b are real numbers.4
It is found that complex numbers obey the standard rules of arithmetic
and algebra. This means that the following rules which normally apply to
ordinary numbers x, y, and z also apply to complex numbers:
Commutative
Associative
Distributive
An important property of complex numbers is that if they are equal then
their real and imaginary parts are equal independently. To see why this

3There are differences in some conventions involving the choice of i or j, but the distinction is
seldom recognized. The use of j in the theory of electrical circuits allows i to be retained as
the conventional symbol for electric current. See L. Beranek. Acoustical Measurements.

modulus signs to identifiy their magnitudes. For example Z, |Z|.

then if
Therefore,
So that, on squaring both sides,
Now (a â c)2 and (b â d)2 are each the squares of real numbers and
therefore positive or zero, but they cannot be greater than zero because a
positive number cannot equal â 1 times another positive number. Therefore
a = c and b â d. It follows that whenever complex numbers are equal, we
also know that their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal.
For example, if
then a = 2 and b = â 5.
It follows further that when complex numbers are added, their real and
imaginary parts are added separately:
However, if two complex numbers are multiplied, the real part of the
product contains elements from both the real and imaginary parts of the
factors, and the same is true for the imaginary part of the product:
If the sign of the imaginary part of a complex number is reversed, we
obtain a new complex number called the complex conjugate of the original
number. The numbers (a+jb) and (a â jb) are conjugates. The asterisk
symbol is often used to identify the complex conjugate. So,
We see therefore that
The square root of ZZ* is a real number called the modulus of the complex
number Z. That is,

Appendix A 379
FIG. A.5 The Argand diagram.
The properties of a complex number, particularly the separate addi-
tion of its real and imaginary parts and the expression of its modulus,
are neatly reproduced if it is thought of as a vector. The vector repre-
sentation can be shown graphically by means of an Argand diagram5
(Figure A.5). In this diagram the imaginary part is displayed on the vertical
axis, and the real part is displayed on the horizontal axis. The complex
number a + jb is shown as a line of length r drawn from the origin and
making an angle 9 with the real axis. It can be written in polar form as (r, 0),
where
The length |r| represents the modulus or magnitude of the complex number.
The angle 6 is sometimes called the argument of the number (not to be
confused with the argument of a function).
The vector addition of the complex numbers ZÂ± = a + jb and Z2 = c + jd
is shown in Figure A. 6. By extension, an indefinite number of complex
vectors can be added in the same way. The process would be represented in
the Argand diagram by constructing a polygon, and the sum of the vectors
would be the line from the origin of the first vector to the end of the last
one. It is important to notice that the same result is obtained regardless of
the order in which the addition is performed. (The addition of complex
numbers is associative and commutative.)

FIG. A.6 Vector addition of complex numbers.
Multiplication of complex numbers does not lead to the standard scalar
or vector products (see the section on vectors). The product of two complex
numbers is a new complex number having real and imaginary parts as
defined in Equation A.I. Multiplication by the unit vector +j or âj is an
important special case. If the number Z = a + jb is multiplied by +j, the
result is jZ = âb+ ja. As Figure A.7 shows, the effect of multiplying by +j
is to rotate the vector Z anticlockwise by n/2. Multiplying by âj produces
a clockwise rotation of n/2. This way of looking at multiplication by j is
particularly important when complex numbers are used to express imped-
ance, because the rotation of the vector through Â± n/2 implies a correspond-
ing change in phase.
Multiplication of a complex number by its conjugate leads to a useful
method for rationalizing fractions that have imaginary parts in the denomi-
nator. Suppose, for example, that we require the complex number Y where
Y = 1/Z and where Z = a + jb. Then
and

Appendix A 381
FIG. A.7 Multiplying a complex number Z by j and by âj.
We are likely to feel uncomfortable with the imaginary term jb in the
denominator because it prevents us from seeing Y as the sum of a real part
and an imaginary one. Fortunately the difficulty is easy to deal with. If the
top and bottom of the fraction are each multiplied by the complex
conjugate, the bottom becomes a real number:
The real and imaginary parts of Y are therefore
and

382 Acoustics for Audiologists
Notice that the modulus of Y is
The arguments 6Y and 6Z of Y and Z are given respectively by tan 6Y = â b/a
and tan 9Z = b/a, and therefore 9Y â â9Z. We see therefore that if complex
numbers are related such that one is the reciprocal of the other, then their
moduli are similarly related and their arguments have opposite signs. It is
important to be aware of these relationships when working with complex
impedance and admittance.
Multiplication and Division
The reciprocal relationship of the moduli of a complex number and its
inverse is a particular case of a more general relationship. Suppose that
where Zt â a +jb and Z2 = c + jd. Then
Therefore,
so that
This means that the modulus of the product of complex numbers is equal
to the product of their moduli.
A similar rule applies to division. Let

Appendix A 383
Then
Therefore,
so that
Therefore the modulus of the quotient of complex numbers is equal to the
quotient of their moduli.
Components of Complex Impedance and Admittance
The real and imaginary components of impedance Z are resistance R and
reactance X. The corresponding components of admittance Y are conduc-
tance G and susceptance B. Therefore
The admittance Y is equal to 1/Z so that
But
If complex numbers are equal, the real part of one is equal to the real part
of the other and the imaginary part of one is equal to the imaginary part of
the other. Therefore

Logarithms
The logarithm is an important mathematical function in its own right, but
before the invention of electronic calculation it had a valuable practical
application as an almost indispensable aid to multiplication and division.
Slide rules6 were to engineers what stethoscopes are to doctors, and every
schoolboy would carry a book of log tables in his satchel. The logarithm
has survived the electronic revolution and is alive and well in the decibel
and in all places where it is a practical convenience to compress the range
of values needed to express the magnitude of the object of our attention.
Logarithms work by expressing a variable x as the exponent of a base
number b. The logarithm is therefore defined by the statement that if
then
For example, Iog2 8 = 3 because 23 = 8.
In ordinary circumstances we use numbers in base 10. Logarithms for
which b is equal to 10 are called common logarithms. The exponential e is
the base of natural logarithms. Unless it is necessary to be explicit, the base
can be omitted in written form to simplify the notation. Unless otherwise
defined, we normally write Iog10x as just log*. Also, logcx is often written
as In x. The names log and In often appear on the keyboards of calculators
and as function names in computer software (but beware that log implies
base e in some software). The compression achieved with logarithmic scaling
is evident in Table A.I.
To use logarithms, we also need a function to provide the inverse of a
logarithm; in other words, we need the function inverse-log(x) that gives us
the number whose logarithm is x. It will be evident from the definition at
6Slide rules achieve multiplication and division by adding or subtracting sections of printed
scales whose lengths are proportional to the logarithms of the numbers they represent.

example, if the common logarithm of a number is 1-7, then the number must
be 101'7, which is 50-11. The name antilogarithm is often used in tables to
mean the inverse of a logarithm.
Multiplication and Division
Numbers may be multiplied by adding their logarithms and then taking the
inverse of this sum. Division involves the same thing except that the
logarithm of the divisor has to be subtracted. If the basis of these operations
is not self-evident, consider the following. Let
Then
so that
By definition, 10(m+n) is the inverse logarithm of (m + ri).
Notice that

386 Acoustics for Audiologists
In general, the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the
factors, that is,
By the same reasoning,
and
This last observation should be remembered when working with decibels,
where the argument of the log function is often squared. For example,
log(p2) = 2 log p.
It may also be noticed that log(l/x) = âlog x. This is because
As shown in Table A.I, log 2 = 0-301 and log (1/2) = log 0-5 = -0-301.
Change of Base
Having found the logarithm of a number, we may occasionally need to find
its logarithm in a different base. This happens, for example, in conversions
between common and natural logarithms.
Let

Therefore,

Also, letting x = b and noting that logft b = 1, we see that

Mantissa and Characteristic
The decimal part of a common logarithm is called the mantissa;7 the integer
part before the decimal point is the characteristic. These terms are not much
used these days but were well known when logarithms were needed for
calculation. It is still helpful to be aware of the role of these two parts of the
logarithm, particularly when working with numbers written in scientific
notation. Consider the following.
If the mantissa is positive, its contribution to the inverse logarithm is
always a number greater than 1, with only one digit before the decimal
point. Its antilog corresponds to the first part of a number written in
scientific form. We can always arrange things so that the mantissa is positive
by changing the characteristic. For example, suppose that a number has the
negative logarithm â2-3. This can be written as ( â 3 + 0-7), and the inverse
logarithm is then 1(T3 x 10Â°'7 = 5-01 x 10"3.
Logarithmic Scales
Nonlinear scales are often used in graphical work. There are two reasons
for this: the first is to turn curves into straight lines (Figure A. 8), and the
second is to accommodate data encompassing a wide range of values. As an
example in the first category, suppose we want to show values of x and y
1 Mantissa = 'makeweight' (Latin).

FIG. A.8 The art of finding the right graph paper to get a straight line. 'For the
statistician, there is always probability paper, which will turn a normal ogive into
a straight line or a normal curve into a tent. It is especially popular with staticians
because it makes their work look precise' (S. A. Rudin. The art of finding the right
graph paper to get a straight line. Journal of Irreproducible Results 12, 1964).

when these are related as
A graph of x and y on linear scales is the curve shown in Figure A.9a. If,
however, we find the logarithm of each side of the equation, we obtain
Because log a and log e are constants, a graph of log y plotted against x is
a straight line whose slope is bloge and whose intercept on the log y axis
is log a (Figure A.9b). Instead of labelling the vertical axis in log units, we
could keep the same scaling but mark the axis in units of y (Figure A.9c).
Chart papers with one or both axes marked out in proportion to the
logarithms of the numbers they represent were widely used in science and
engineering, but their use as a technical aid has declined now that computer
processing is universally available.
Logarithmic scaling is particularly helpful when a wide range of values is
to be presented graphically. It is nearly always necessary in acoustics and in
audiological work when showing variation with frequency; the audiogram
is an obvious example (Figure A. 10). To understand this scaling better,
consider first what happens on an ordinary linear scale. Here equal intervals

represent equal additions to the variable, so starting with x0, the scale is
marked at intervals
On frequency scales, we want equal intervals to represent equal frequency
ratios. Starting from /0, the scale is marked at intervals

390 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. A.10 Logarithmic scales: the audiogram.
For example, if /â = 125 Hz and n = 2, we have
Taking the logarithms of these numbers gives
which is a linear scale in intervals of log n. This illustrates the important fact
that equal intervals in a logarithmic scale are equivalent to equal ratios of
the variable represented. In a scale of decibels, for instance, equal decibel
differences correspond to equal ratios of acoustic power.
On scales that represent frequency of vibration, it is sometimes necessary
to know the frequency fc that is located graphically at the centre of the
interval between frequencies fÂ± and /2. In accordance with this requirement,

so that
That is, fc is the geometric mean of /i and /2.
Trigonometric Functions
The sine function and its relatives (cosine, tangent, and so on) are given by
the ratios of the lengths of sides of a right triangle. Accordingly, the sine and
cosine functions can be generated from the vertical or horizontal projection
of the radius of a circle. Figure A. 11 shows a circle whose centre is at 0 on
the line X'X. P is a point on the circumference of the circle, and PQ is the
perpendicular from P to X'X. We may regard PQ as the vertical projection
of the radius OP, and OQ as the horizontal projection. Let 9 be the angle
POQ. The sine and cosine functions are defined as follows:
and
FIG. A.11 The trigonometric functions.

392 Acoustics for Audiologists
The ratio of these functions is the tangent function:
The reciprocals of these functions have the names secant, cosecant, and
cotangent:
The circle in Figure A. 11 can be divided into quadrants by drawing the
line Y'Y perpendicular to X'X through the centre. The quadrants are
numbered 1 to 4 as shown. We use the usual convention that distances
measured upwards from X'X are positive while distances measured down-
wards are negative. The same applies respectively to distances measured to
the right and left of Y'Y. The radius OP is positive in all quadrants. The
diagram shows P in the first quadrant, but it could be anywhere on the
circle. From the definitions given earlier we see that the value of the sine
function is positive when OP is in the first and second quadrants and
negative when OP is in the third and fourth quadrants. We also see that the
sine of a negative angle created by a clockwise rotation of OP from the
horizontal is minus the sine of the corresponding positive angle; that is,
sin(0) = â sin( â 6). Similarly, we see that the cosine function is positive in
the first and fourth quadrants and negative in the others, and that
cos(0) = cos( â 0). The rule for remembering which of the three principal
trigonometric functions are positive is 'all, sin, tan, cos' applied in quadrants
1 to 4, respectively.
Suppose that the point P moves around the circumference to generate an
ever-increasing angle, either positive if the rotation is anticlockwise, or
negative if it is clockwise. Projecting the radius on the vertical gives the
continuous sine function shown in Figure A. 12. Points to notice are the
following:

Appendix A 393
FIG. A.12 The sine function.
Sin 6 itself varies between +1 and â 1 in each cycle. The maxima and
minima occur once in each cycle. The least positive angle for which sin 6 is
equal to 1 is n/2; the least positive angle for which it is equal to â 1 is 3n/2.
The greatest absolute value of the sine wave that has been constructed, is
the length of the radius OP. If the length of the radius is a, its vertical
projection y is the function a sin 6. The length of the radius is the amplitude
of the wave.
The cosine function is similar to the sine function except that it is
displaced towards the origin by a quarter of a cycle. We can generate a
cosine by projection of OP onto the horizontal. The result is shown in
Figure A. 13. Points to notice are the following:
The cosine function is equal to 1 if the angle is zero or an even multiple of
Â± 7i, and â 1 if it is an odd multiple of + n.
Note also that:

Phaser Diagram
In the theory of vibrations, we often require the sine or cosine of an angle
cot that increases progressively with time t at co radians per second.
Moreover, we often wish to compare two vibrations that have the same
frequency but differ in phase by an angle </>. For simplicity let us suppose
that these vibrations are
and

Appendix A 395
In the previous discussion we used the rotating line OP to generate the
sine functions. We should regard this line as a vector whose length is
proportional to the amplitude of a vibration and whose direction represents
the angle for which the sine is required. The first of the vibrations just given
can be represented in circle diagram with a radius vector of length a rotating
anticlockwise at the rate o>. The second can be similarly represented by a
radius vector of length b. If we take the horizontal to represent the angle at
time zero, then at time t these vectors point in the directions cot and cot + </>,
respectively. We can draw both vectors as lines from a common centre as
in Figure A. 14. Because they have the same angular frequencies, they rotate
FIG. A.14

396 Acoustics for Audiologists
together at the rate co. The important aspect of the diagram is that the
angular separation of the vectors is constant. It is equal to the phase
difference <Â£ of the two vibrations. The diagram is called a phasor diagram,
and its purpose is to depict phase relationships. We can see immediately that
vibration v leads vibration u because 0 is positive. Amplitudes are not
usually represented fully, if only because they often refer to different physical
quantities and so cannot be drawn to scale in the same diagram. We can
think of the rotating vectors in a phasor diagram as having unit length, so
that in the example just given they represent sin cot rather than a sin cot, and
sin(cot 4- $) rather than b sin(cot + <Â£).
Relationships Between the Trigonometric Functions
Figure A. 15 shows a right-angled triangle. The length of the hypotenuse is
c, and the lengths of the sides opposite the interior angles A and B are a and
b, respectively. By definition, sin A = a/c, cos A = b/c, and tan A = b/c.
Therefore,
But

and
Inverse Trigonometric Functions
The function that gives the value of the angle whose sine is x is called the
inverse sine of x. There are similar inverse functions corresponding to cosine
and tangent and the other trigonometric functions (see also the section
Inverse Functions). There are several ways of naming these functions.
Taking the inverse of sin A as an example, we have
The first of these is not often seen in print, but it is found on pocket
calculators to show the keystrokes needed to obtain the inverse function.
The second form is quite common but has the disadvantage of possible
confusion with (sin x)"1. The third form is frequently used in print. The
shortened version ASIN() is often a named function in computer software.
The trigonometric functions are periodic. The corresponding inverse
functions therefore have multiple values. For instance:
Because the inverse functions provide multiple answers, care is needed to
see that the appropriate answers are returned when they are evaluated using
calculators or computers. In most cases the smallest result in the range â n
to + 7i will be offered. In the preceding example, a calculator or computer
would give the value of arccos( â1/2) as 2n/3 (120Â°).
The inverse function that we are most likely to need in elementary
acoustics is the arctangent. This is required when finding the phase angle

398 Acoustics for Audiologists
whose tangent is the ratio of the imaginary and real parts of the acoustic
impedance. In this context the required angle must lie in the range â n to
+ n. Although this narrows the choice, there is still room for ambiguity if a
simple inverse tangent is calculated electronically. Some calculators and
some computer software provide arctan functions of fractions for which the
numerator and denominator have to be entered separately.8 There is then
no ambiguity and the calculated result is necessarily correct.
The Compound Angle Formulae
If A and B are any two angles, their sum or difference is called a compound
angle when it appears as the argument of one of the trigonometric functions.
We often need to express the result in terms of functions of these angles
taken singly. The basic formulae are as follows:
These formulae are the bedrock of analysis. Here are some examples of their use.
Example 1
Suppose that A = cot and B = </>. Equation A.4 then tells us that
where R is a constant.
If we now let P = R cos 0 and Q = R sin </>, we have, after some rearran-
gement,
This means that any harmonic oscillation is equivalent to the sum of two
oscillations of the same frequency that differ in phase by n/2. From
Equations A.2 and A.3 and our definitions of P and 0, we see that
Calculators often provide transforms from rectangular to polar coordinates. After entering x
and y values, the results (x2 + y2)1/2 and arctan(y/x) can be displayed.

Appendix A 399
Example 2
By putting A = B so that A + B = 2A, we obtain useful formulae for the
sine and cosine of the double angle. From Equations A.4 and A.6 we see that
and
If we now make use of the relationship between sine and cosine functions
given in Equation A. 3 we obtain
and
If we replace A by A/2 in this last equation and rearrange it, we obtain a
result that we shall need in Example 4:
Example 3
Suppose two trigonometric functions are multiplied. As an example, con-
sider the product sin A cos B. There are times when it is useful to express
this and similar products in terms of the sum of trigonometric functions. The
method is to add or subtract the appropriate compound angle equations.
So, for the example just given, adding Equations A.4 and A.5 gives
This method is used again in the next example. It is also required to
explain the creation of side bands in an amplitude-modulated signal
(Chapter 5).
Example 4
If we want to combine sounds from different sources, we may wish to add
sinusoids having different frequencies, different phases, and different ampli-
tudes. To do this we need a formula for the addition a sin x + b sin y, where

400 Acoustics for Audiologists
x is the frequency and phase of one vibration (e.g., x = cot + </>) and y
expresses the corresponding frequency and phase of the other vibration.
Let
Then
If we add Equations A.4 and A. 5 and multiply throughout by a, we obtain
Similarly, subtracting and multiplying by $ gives
The latter two equations add to give
So that substituting for a, /?, A, and B gives the desired result, namely,
If the vibrations have the same amplitudes, then (a â b) is zero, so that this
expression simplifies to
The cosine term can be replaced by the cosine of (x â y) using Equation A.8
to give

Appendix A 401
This now has the same form as the equation used to describe acoustic beats
in Chapter 3.
Average Values of the Trigonometric Functions
The average value of a sine or cosine function taken over a whole number
of cycles is zero because the average during the negative parts of each cycle
exactly cancels the average during the positive parts. However, the absolute
value of a sinusoid (a rectified voltage, for example) has a waveform that
lies entirely above zero (Figure A. 16). It can be shown that the average
absolute value during a whole number of cycles is 2a/n, where a is the
amplitude. If a sine function is squared, its value is again always one-sided
and its average is nonzero. It can be shown that this average over a complete
number of cycles is a2/2, where a is the amplitude. The square root of this
average is the root mean square (rms) value. The rms value of a sinusoid is
therefore the peak value (the amplitude) divided by root 2, that is, a/^/2.
The square root of 2 is 1.414.

Scientific Notation
Technical writing and calculation frequently involve working with numbers
whose values range from the very small to the very large. The expression
and arithmetical processing of such numbers is greatly helped by writing
them in scientific notation. In this form only one digit precedes the decimal
point, and the correct magnitude is obtained by multiplication by a power
of 10. For example, the speed of light is 299,790,000 ms"1. This can be
written more conveniently as 2-9979 x 108 ms"1. A 2-mm diameter rain-
drop has a mass of about 0-0000042 kg, which could be written better as
4-2xlO~ 6 kg. In so-called engineering notation, the powers of 10 are
restricted to multiples of 3 and there are then up to three digits before the
decimal point. In this form, for example, the speed of light is 299-79 x 106
ms"1. The scientific and engineering formats are available on many pocket
calculators. In technical work it is good manners (and good sense) to limit
the number of digits in the final result to accord with the precision that is
meaningful. The speed of light could legitimately be written as 299-79 x 106
ms"1, but whether this was significantly different from 299-8 x 106 ms"1 in
a physical rather than an arithmetic sense would depend on the accuracy of
the measurement.
Units and Dimensions
Let us start with an example. The kinetic energy of a moving mass is found
from the formula
where m is mass and v is velocity. In order for this, or any other formula, to
be true, the quantity on the left-hand side must be of the same physical kind
as the quantity on the right-hand side. In the example, the quantity on the
left is energy and the quantity on the right, the product mv2, must also be
an energy. We use the word dimension to mean 'physical kind' and say that
E and mv2 have dimensions of energy. In order to confirm that the formula
is dimensionally consistent, it is helpful to express the dimensions of each
component in terms of the dimensions of more primitive quantities such as
mass, length, and time. The dimensional interpretation is shown by the use
of square brackets: [M], [L], and [T].

Appendix A 403
Energy is defined as force multiplied by distance, and force is mass
multiplied by acceleration. Accordingly,
On the right side of the formula the dimensions are
The dimensions of quantities on the left side of the formula are therefore the
same as those on the right. We can use any units we wish to quantify E,
with the proviso that they must be consistent from term to term. If E is in
joules, then mass must be in kg and velocity in metres per second; if E is in
foot-poundals, then mass must be in pounds and velocity must be in feet per
second because the poundal is the force needed to give a mass of 1 pound
an acceleration of 1 foot per second.
Vigilance in observing the correctness of dimensions and units helps to
avoid mistakes in algebraic working and numerical calculation. Here is an
example. Suppose we are deriving an expression for the volume V of an
ellipsoid whose principal radii are a and b. We arrive at the expression
We should notice that this cannot be true because the dimensions of the
terms in the parentheses are mixed, [L] and [L2], whereas only [L] is
required, so that the multiplication with b2 gives a volume [L3]. The last
term should be 2<z/3.
Mathematical expressions often contain terms that have no associated
physical dimension. Such terms are simply numbers and are said to be
dimensionless. The constants e and n are dimensionless, as are functions such
as ex, sin x, and log x. Their arguments must also be dimensionless. Consider
the formula for the decay of the voltage V across a capacitor C when its
charge is allowed to leak through a resistance R for a time t:
The exponent t/CR must be dimensionless. It is composed of two elements,
a time in the numerator and CR in the denominator. From the formula
Q = CV where Q is electric charge, we see that capacitance has dimensions
[QF"1]. But electric current is the rate of flow of charge, so that charge is

404 Acoustics for Audiologists
current x time and [Q] can be replaced by [IT], giving capacitance the
dimensions [C] = [/TF"1]. Because V â IR, we see that the dimensions of
resistance are [R~\ = [F/"1]. The dimensions of the exponent are therefore
The time dimension cancels leaving the result that the exponent is dimen-
sionless and therefore independent of the units of measurement of t, C, and
R provided that they are self-consistent.
Vectors
Many quantities have a direction associated with them. Velocity in the full
sense of the word includes the direction of travel, a force is said to act in a
specified direction, and so on. Such quantities are called vectors to distin-
guish them from scalar quantities that have no directional connotation.
Ordinary space is three-dimensional and we would need three coordinates
to specify the direction of a vector, but to keep things simple we will limit
this short account to vectors lying in the same plane.
A vector can be represented diagramatically by a straight line. The length
of the line is proportional to the magnitude of the vector, and the direction
from the origin of the line to its termination shows the direction of the
vector. A vector representing the motion of a ship travelling at 15 knots
northeast would be a line whose length is scaled to represent the 15 knots
and whose direction from the origin shows a 45Â° heading. We can take
this picture further by imagining that the ship's speed has been measured
relative to the water and that the northeasterly heading is the compass
bearing. Suppose now that there is an ocean current such that the water is
moving due west at 5 knots. What then is the course and speed of the
ship relative to the ocean floor? To solve this problem we note that the
ocean current can be represented by a vector of length 5 knots in
the direction 270Â°. Adding the two vectors gives the answer to the problem.
The addition, represented in Figure A. 17, can be performed by scale drawing
or trigonometry.
Addition and Subtraction
Vectors A and B can be added as just explained.9 They can be subtracted
by reversing the direction of one of them and then adding. This is illustrated
9As with complex numbers, we show vectors in ordinary rather than bold type and use
modulus signs to identify their magnitudes. For example, A, \A\.

in Figure A. 18. The sum and difference of two vectors can be represented by
the two diagonals of the parallelogram. To understand this, we must realise
that when a line is drawn to represent a vector, the position of the line on
the page is immaterial. What matters is its length and direction. A vector
can be represented by any one of a number of parallel lines of the same
length.

406 Acoustics for Audiologists
FIG. A.19 
A polygon formed by adding vectors.
Figure A.19 shows the addition of several vectors. The diagram is a series
of connected lines, and the vector representing the final sum is the line
joining the origin of the first vector to the end of the last. The order in which
the lines are drawn, that is, the order in which the vectors are added, does
not affect the result.
Components
We often require the component of a vector in a specified direction. In the
example given earlier, we might want to know the rate at which the ship is
progressing in a specified directionâdue north, for instance. If vector A is
inclined at an angle 9 to the x-direction, then its component in the
x-direction is a vector in that direction having the magnitude \A\ cos 6.
A vector is equivalent to the sum of any two of its components acting in
mutually perpendicular directions, for instance, parallel to the x- and y-axes.
If the angle to the x-axis is 6, then the components are \A\ cos 6 and \A\ sin Q,
respectively (Figure A.20). The critical reader might object that the compo-
nents in the form just written are not vectors at all because \A\ is scalar and
the cosine or sine of an angle likewise. In a more formal mathematical
treatment this difficulty is overcome by defining unit vectors (vectors having
unit magnitude) directed along the x- and y-axes. These vectors when
multiplied by the scalar quantities just given are the true component vectors.
Multiplying a vector by a scalar factor simply gives a new vector whose
length is increased by the factor and whose direction is unchanged.

Appendix A 407
FIG. A.20 Components of a vector.
Multiplication
Can vectors be multiplied? The answer is yes, but the method and the
interpretation of the result depend on which convention is applied. There
are two important forms of product. The scalar or 'dot' product of two
vectors is a scalar (nondirectional) quantity found by multiplying the
magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. So for
the vectors A and B,
To give an example of this form of multiplication, suppose that a force
acts on an object that can move only in a direction inclined to that of the
force. In other words, the force acts obliquely to the direction of movement
(Figure A.21). The force and the amount of movement can be represented
FIG. A.21 Multiplying vectors: the scalar product of the vectors Fand S.

408 Acoustics for Audiologists
by vectors F and S. The work done by the force is scalar and equal to the
product of the magnitudes of F and S multiplied by the cosine of the angle
between them. A way of looking at this is to see |F| cos 6 as the magnitude
of the component force in the same direction as S. This component moves
its point of application through a distance |S| in the same direction, doing
the work |F| \S\ cos 6.
We are not likely to meet the vector, or 'cross', product of vectors in
audiological acoustics, and it is mentioned here only for the sake of
completeness. If vector C is the vector product of A and B, then
Vector C has magnitude \A\ \B\ sin 6 and lies in a direction perpendicular to
the plane containing A and B.

Appendix B
Working with Decibels
The following worked examples and questions are intended to give the
reader practice and confidence in working numerical problems involving
decibels. Correct answers are given at the end of the appendix. It is
inadvisable to attempt all the questions at one sitting or to work through
them from the first to the last. It is better to do a few from each section at
regular intervals. A few examples are given here in laborious detail, but this
is just to illustrate the basic principles. Try to answer some of the questions
in the same way before taking short cuts. Readers who are not entirely at
ease with the underlying mathematics should turn to the sections on
exponents and logarithms in Appendix A. A calculator or a book of log
tables is essential.
To begin, it is important to become completely familiar with the calcula-
tor or tables that will be used. Notice that calculators (and computers) often
provide two kinds of logarithms, either log, which usually (but unfortunately
not always) means 'logarithm to base 10', or In, which means 'logarithm to
base e\ Base 10 is needed for decibels. Keys that provide the inverse
functionâthe antilogarithmâare generally labelled 'inv log' or '10*'. In
computer languages and spreadsheets, the caret (A) is often used to denote
an exponent so, for example, the formula ' = 10A 2' in a spreadsheet would
be evaluated as 102, giving 100 as the result.
Tables
It is anticipated that most readers will use calculators for arithmetical work.
If, however, tables are to be used, one has to remember that logarithms are
tabulated only for numbers less than 10, and antilogarithms are tabulated
only for the decimal part of the logarithm (the mantissa). Here are some
examples.
To find log(256), write this as log(102 x 2-56), which is the same as
log(10)2 + log(2-56). By definition, log(10)2 is equal to 2, and log(2-56) is
found from tables to be 04082. Therefore, log(256) = 24082.
To find log(0-00256), think of it as log(10~3 x 2-56), which is log(10~3)
+ log(2-56). Therefore, log(0-00256) = -3 + 04082 = -2-5918.
409

410 Acoustics for Audiologists
To find antilog(3.16), we note that this is the same as antilog(3 + 0-16),
which is equal to antilog(3) x antilog(0-16). The first factor, which is not
tabulated, is 103; the second factor is found in the tables to be 1-445, so that
the result in scientific form is 1-445 x 103.
To find antilog(â3-16), we first have to replace the number in the
parentheses by a negative integer added to a positive decimal. Accordingly,
we write antilog(â3-16) = antilog( â4 + 0-84), which is antilog(â4) x anti-
log(0-84). The tables show antilog (0-84) to be 6-9183, to give the result
6-9183 x 1(T4.
Preliminary Exercise
Use a calculator or tables or common sense to evaluate the following. The
answers are shown in the square brackets.
Converting Absolute Values to
Decibels
We should be aware that the quantity in decibels is always acoustic power
or one of its cousins, such as sound intensity, so the basic formula is n = 10
log W/WQ, where W is the power of the sound source or a quantity propor-
tional to it and W0 is a reference power. When, as often happens, we have
to work with sound pressure or its relatives, such as voltage or particle
velocity, the values of the physical quantities have to be squared to obtain
the corresponding power ratios. Because log x2 = 2 log x, the squaring
is conveniently done by multiplying by 2 in the basic formula; that is,
n = 20 log p/p0.

Express the following in decibels relative to the reference value given. If no
reference value is given, assume it to be a sound pressure of 20 /iPa. Give
the results to the nearest 0-1 dB.
Example
Express in decibels, 40 mPa re 1 Pa.
Converting Quantities Expressed in Decibels
to Absolute Values
This operation is the converse of that in the preceding section. If the
reference quantity has units of power or its equivalent (watts or watts per
m2, for example), then the first step is to divide the number of decibels by
10 before finding the antilog. If the square of the reference quantity is
proportional to power, we divide by 20 to avoid having to find a square
root. This means that we divide by 20 if the answer is required in units of
sound pressure, voltage, acceleration, and so on.

brackets. Where no reference value is given, assume it to be 20 ^Pa. Where
appropriate, give the answer to three significant figures.

(e) 9-4 dB re 1 mV [V]
(f)

Appendix B 413
Changing the Reference Value
The zero point of any decibel scale is determined by the reference value. For
sound pressure level, for example, the reference value is usually 20 /^Pa.
Occasionally we may wish to use other reference values. Converting from
one scale to another is usually quite straightforward. Increasing the refer-
ence value raises the zero point of the decibel scale and decreases the
number of decibels that correspond to a given physical magnitude. The
converse is also true. For example, a voltage level of 70 dB re 1 fiV would
be the same as 10 dB re 1 mV because the reference value has been increased
1000-fold, and accordingly the scale values must be reduced by 20 log(lOOO),
that is, by 60 dB. Similarly, a sound intensity level of 17 dB re 1 W/m2 would
be 77 dB above 1 /iW/m2 because the reference has been reduced by a factor
of 106, raising scale values by 10 log(106), that is, by 60 dB. The foregoing
may seem obvious, but we sometimes encounter conversions that need
careful thought if mistakes are to be avoided. Here is an example.
Suppose that the sensitivity M of a microphone is given by the manufac-
turer as â20-3 dB re 1 mV/0-01 Pa. This is a rather unfriendly unit, so we
would like to change it to V/Pa. We may argue as follows. Let M0 be the
reference sensitivity. Then

(x) -41 dB re 1 W/m3 [^W/m3]
(y) 0-1 dB re 1 mW [mW]
(z) 83-5 dB [mPa]

414 Acoustics for Audiologists
A change to 1 V/Pa will therefore increase the reference sensitivity by a
factor of 10 and so decrease the number of decibels by 20 log 10, that is, by
20. The sensitivity of the microphone is therefore (â 20-3 â 20) â = 40-3 re
1 V/Pa.
Exercise 3
Refer the levels in the following examples to the new reference values shown
in the square brackets.
Adding and Subtracting Quantities
Expressed in Decibels
It may seem that questions on 'adding decibels' are contrived to torment
students, but the need to add or subtract energy-related quantities often
arises in practice. In Chapter 6 we saw that sound-level readings could be
corrected for inherent noise in the measuring instruments or for background
noise by subtracting the noise from the signal plus the noise. The arithmeti-
cal difficulty in this process is that the measured quantities are expressed in
decibels. A similar problem occurs when addition is required. For example,
we may wish to combine sound levels measured in third-octave bands to
find the level in a one-octave band. Another example is the addition of
sound exposures occurring in different periods of work. The method is as
follows:
1. Convert decibels to absolute values.
2. Add or subtract absolute values as required.
3. Convert absolute values to decibels.
(a) 35 dB re 20 ^Pa [1 juPa]
(b) -42 dB re 1 ,uW [1 mW]
(c) 63 dB re 1 cm/s2 [1 m/s2]
(d) -22 dB re 1 N [1 pN]
(e) 6-3 dB re 1 V [1 mV]
(f) 51 dB re 1 /zbar [20 /iPa]

(k) 19 dB re 1 dyne/cm2 [20 /xPa]
(1 dyne = 10~5N)
(1) 73 dB re 1 erg/cm3 [1 J/m3]
(lerg = Kr7 J)

Appendix B 415
Steps 1 and 3 have already been practised in Exercises 1 and 2, so the only
further requirement is the addition or subtraction in step 2. It should be
noted, however, that the quantities to be added or subtracted must be
proportional to power (or energy).
We start with a simple example. Two independent sources, A and B,
produce noise levels of 12 dB and 14 dB respectively when acting alone.
What level is expected when both sources are on at the same time?
where LA = 12 dB and LB = 14 dB. Therefore,
where pi and pi are the mean squared sound pressures corresponding to the
action of sources A and B, respectively. The squares of the sound pressures
are proportional to the acoustic power of the sources, and they may be
added:
Therefore,
Therefore,
so that the sound level when both sources are on at the same time is
This arithmetic is very easily accomplished using an electronic calculator.
Models differ, but the sequence of keystrokes shown in Table B.I, or
