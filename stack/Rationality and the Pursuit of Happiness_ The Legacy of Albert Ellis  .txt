Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
“This book is the missing link between one of the most prominent movements
in the mental health ﬁeld – rational-emotive and cognitive-behavioral therapy
(REBT/CBT) – and one of the hottest topics in the clinical ﬁeld, namely
positive psychology. By integrating the two, the book bridges a gap. Exploring
the role of rationality in happiness, as conceptualized by Albert Ellis, the book
shows (a) how REBT/CBT can be applied not only for preventing and treating
disorders or for health promotion, but also for human development / optimi-
zation; and (b) how positive psychology should be conceptualized in a scientiﬁc
manner, avoiding Pollyannaish thinking. Indeed, Albert Ellis convincingly
argued that rationality is the royal path’ to authentic happiness, and this
book is a powerful guide for those interested in exploring and pursuing this
path, betheypatients,generalpublic orprofessionals (clinicians andresearchers
alike).”

Albert Ellis challenged us to work vigorously to abandon the irrational and
emotionally explosive demands that we tend to impose on ourselves and others,
escalating manageable frustrations into seemingly unbearable disasters, and
needlessly promoting anxiety, depression, anger, and guilt. With a refreshingly
original emphasis on the pursuit of happiness, Michael Bernard has provided a
well-informed and engaging account of the life and work of this famed rational
thinker and therapist that will make Ellis’ work accessible to abroad readership.’

Preface
Albert Ellis is a genius. I don’t say this lightly or merely to beat his drum more
loudlynortrumpethiscause.Rather,thefactemphasizesthathisunderstanding
of people’s emotional lives including their misery as well as their happiness is
based on a unique and expansive aptitude and ability.
Ellisapplied hisintellect to answering the eternal question ofwhatmakes for a
happy life. The combination of superior intellect (he scored in the ninety-ninth
percentile on intelligence tests including the US Army Alpha IQ test) with
insatiable reading of ancient and modern-day philosophers and psychologists
since he was a teenager, and 60 years of individual and group clinical practice
with thousands of clients has yielded his impressive array of principles and
practices everyone can use to guide their pursuit of happiness and fulﬁllment.
What is of particular interest is that Ellis tested out his evolving theories and
practices on himself. The earliest beginnings of his rational-emotive behavior
therapy (REBT) can be traced to Ellis’ personal life in the 1920s and 1930s where
he began to cope with his own severe physical and emotional health problems,
including nephritis,shynessaboutmeetingfemalesandpublicspeaking anxiety.
In addition to their essential merit, there are a number of reasons why today
Ellis’ view on happiness need to see the light of day.
In recent years, he has written more about the causes and remedies for
emotional problems such as anxiety, anger, depression, self-pity, and guilt than
he has on happiness. It is time to examine more closely what he has to say about
happiness.
The current expanding ﬁeld of positive psychology with its emphasis on
happiness, positive thinking, and character strengths, as well as happiness
interventions (e.g., novel application of character strengths, expressing

gratitude) has generally excluded the constructs and practices identiﬁed by Ellis
as central to happiness.
Perhaps, because of his high intelligence, his afﬁliation with ethical human-
ism, and his long-standing interest in thinking and problem solving, he
narrowed his focus of study and professional practice to the uniquely human
and innate, biological tendencies of rationality and irrationality.
While Ellis passed away from natural causes at 93 in 2007, his legacy in the
form of his words (books, papers, DVDs, CDs) lives on. I have elected to write
mostly about his views in the present rather than past tense.
Since 1979, I have visited Albert Ellis on numerous occasions. I spent a full
year working as a visiting fellow at the Albert Ellis Institute in 1991. The many
hours I spent working with Ellis have been the most fulﬁlling of my professional
life. Onseparate occasions,weinvitedEllistovisitAustralia where he conducted
professional workshops and talks for the general public.
This book lays out in the words of Albert Ellis the difference between the
psychological architecture of emotional misery he calls irrationality and the
psychological architecture of happiness deemed rationality. Both processes
operate across the life span (rationality emerging developmentally later around
the age of seven) with irrationality contributing to our unhappiness and
rationality contributing to self-actualization, happiness, and fulﬁllment. Ellis
and REBT have always focused on people’s rational, self-actualizing potentiali-
ties for happiness and their irrational, self-defeating, misery-creating
tendencies.
The aspect of irrationality responsible for most of human unhappiness is
illustrated throughout this book. Ellis saysthat humanshaveaninnate tendency
to greater or lesser extents to take their desires, preferences, and wishes for love,
success, comfort, and for happiness and to formalize them into absolutistic
musts, shoulds, oughts, needs., and commands (he refers to this tendency as
musterbation) (see Chapter 2).
Ellis has identiﬁed additional unhappiness-creating, irrational ways of think-
ing about adverse events that derive from absolutistic thinking including:
awfulizing, I-can’t-stand-it-itis, and global rating of the worth of oneself, others,
and the world.
The pursuit of happiness can often be thwarted by emotional blocks (e.g.,
anxiety, depression, anger, procrastination) that people experience when con-
fronted with adversity, misfortune, and life’s frustrations. Ellis says that people
who are searching for happiness had better possess ways of overcoming
emotional distress. For Ellis, the key is recognizing one’s irrational thinking
and beliefs in emotionally charged situations and cognitively restructuring
irrational demands, commands, shoulds, and needs. into preferences using his
ABC-DE scientiﬁc method (see Chapter 3).
Ellis combines the zeal of a revolutionary and a gene for efﬁciency in
advocating that people have the right to take control of their own personal
search for happiness (short-term pleasure and long-term fulﬁllment) and not
wait for others to do so – as long as the journey does not cause pain and
Preface
xvi

unnecessary harm to the interests and welfare of others. Through scientiﬁc
thinking and problem solving, the search for happiness can be done in a
somewhat systematic and purposeful fashion.
For Ellis, people putting into action a rational philosophy of living can abet
happiness. This rational mindset consists of rational principles that once people
are aware of, can assist in helping them to refuse to be desperately unhappy as
well as to experience pleasure, enjoyment, satisfaction, and fulﬁllment in the
short- and long-term. Happiness-creating rational principles of living include
self-interest, self-direction, social interest, self-acceptance, acceptance of un-
certainty, ﬂexibility, scientiﬁc thinking, risk-taking, and commitment to vital
interests (see Chapter 4).
Without doubt, Ellis identiﬁes being committed to creative and absorbing
activities as the number one happiness-producing behavior. Ellis debunks a pre-
vailing notion of millions of people: “The idea that you can achieve maximum
human happiness by inertia and inaction or by passivity and uncommittedly
enjoying yourself.” Instead, he advocates that people discover, through think-
ing, experimenting, and risk-taking what they personally want to do (and want
not to do) with the one life they have and how to do (and not to do) exactly that.
Ellis says that while everyone has the potential for rationality, the potential
needs. to be cultivated. Through human inertia as well as the proclivity for
emotional difﬁculties, Ellis calls for willpower as the human faculty that can help
people to continuously rid themselves of irrational beliefs and to engage their
rational intellect in planning for how best to live their lives.
Ellis also says that a key to happiness is the ability to solve problems, largely by
thinking ﬂexibly and scientiﬁcally. As revealed in many of the transcripts of Ellis’
therapy sessions that appear in this book, Ellis works at helping people rid
themselves of their command that life shouldn’t be so hard. Instead, he helps
explore with thema variety of problem-solvingoptions fordealing with practical
problems that, once resolved, frees individuals to more thoroughly enjoy life.
Another key to happiness is being able to manage your emotions as quickly and
painlessly as possible when confronted with the muddles and puddles of life.
Naturally, Ellis nominates REBT and the use of cognitive, emotive, and
behavioral methods for disputing and re-structuring irrational beliefs as a
heavyweight contender – but not the only one in the ring.
Despite criticism, Ellis and REBT have always been scientiﬁc. Ellis always
lamented that as a result of the Albert Ellis Institute (formerly the Institute for
Rational Emotive Therapy and the Institute for Rational Living) not being
afﬁliated with a university, he has been unable to attract research funding to test
hishypothesesabouttheroleofrationalityandirrationalityinhumanhappiness.
The 10 questions about happiness that Ellis would want to test empirically
include:
.
What is the relationship between principles of rational living (e.g., self-
interest, self-acceptance, social interest, hedonism) and people’s short- and
long-term happiness?
Preface
xvii

.
Do different principles of rational living contribute differentially to
happiness?
.
What is the relationship between irrationality (e.g., absolutistic thinking;
irrational beliefs) and happiness?
.
Do frequent periods of emotional unhappiness (extreme anger, anxiety,
and/or feelings of depression) block happiness?
.
Does repeatedly getting very angry at a partner impact both happiness in the
relationship and general happiness?
.
Does the potential happiness-producing intervention involving learning
techniques for overcoming procrastination lead to increased happiness?
.
Do people who successfully learn the potential happiness-producing inter-
vention for managing their emotional misery (e.g., challenging and chang-
ing irrational beliefs, the ABCs of REBT) ﬁnd their level of happiness and
pleasure increases?
.
Does the potential happiness-producing intervention of putting into prac-
tice one or more of the principles of rational living (e.g., self-acceptance)
that are not as strong for a given individual as they could be, result in
increased happiness?
.
Does the potential happiness-producing intervention of increasing one’s
participation in vitally absorbing, intrinsically motivating activities lead to
an increased level of happiness?
.
Does the potential happiness-producing intervention of problem solving
lead to enhanced satisfaction and enjoyment?
In this book, I have tried to capture the essential Albert Ellis by using his
spoken and written words. In the ﬁrst four chapters, I present his main theories,
principles, and practices that well serve the search for personal happiness and
misery reduction. To illustrate how Albert Ellis applies REBT to many clients in
psychotherapy, Chapters 5 through 12 of this book consist of verbatim
transcripts of dialogue from actual therapy sessions that are organized around
common problems of everyday living. The verbatim text of some of his therapy
sessions with real clients ﬁrst appeared in a book I wrote a number of years ago,
Staying Rational in an Irrational World. These transcripts are interspersed with
my comments so that the points Ellis makes during the sessions will be clear.
Each chapter deals with an aspect of modern-day living (e.g., love, relationships,
sex, women, homosexuality, work, children and parents, death and dying) and
how the client was helped to use REBT with this problem in order to reduce
emotional misery and achieve personal happiness.
I have included a transcript of one of Ellis’ most popular talks for the general
public, “Rational Living in an Irrational World” where he discusses an extensive
range ofirrationalitiesthatexistinallareasoflifeandhowarationaloutlookcan
help people to cope and to live fulﬁlled lives.
The ﬁnal section of this book contains excerpts from several interviews
between Ellis and myself, conducted over the past 20 years during which I
offered Ellis the opportunity to view the past, present, and future developments

of REBT. In particular, I raised issues with him concerning how his rational
approach to living could be applied in understanding some of the more
important current issues. Additional insights are also provided by Ellis into
his professional and personal life.
Ellis would agree. People had better be optimistic but not unrealistic about
their potential for greater happiness through rationality. Rationality is no
miracle cure but people can have conﬁdence it may work.
I welcome your comments on this book and the work of Albert Ellis

Albert Ellis and the Pursuit
of Happiness
At the age of 16, I studied philosophy as a hobby, long before I ever
thought of becoming a psychotherapist. I was particularly interested in the
philosophy of human happiness. So I started devising ways for people –
notably myself – to reduce their emotional upsets and increase their sense
of fulﬁllment in life . . . As a result of my self-experimentation and of my
gratifying success in overcoming my public speaking and my social
phobias, I even wrote a manuscript when I was in my twenties and
not yet decided to become a therapist: The Art of Not Making Yourself
Unhappy . . . At the age of 40, I went back to ancient philosophers, the
Greeks and Romans and modern-day philosophers to see what they said
about misery and happiness . . . Because of my passion for philosophy and
especially for the philosophy of happiness, my early books on REBT not
only told people how to ward off misery and neurosis but how to be self-
fulﬁlled and more actualizing in their love, marriage and family
affairs.15,17,19
Over the past 60 years, an approach to modern-day living has evolved. This
approach not only shows how the distinctly human mental faculty of rationality
can help most everyone to be less unhappy and emotionally miserable when
faced with adversities, unfortunate, or frustrating events, but also how they can
live an enjoyable, pleasurable, fulﬁlled, and happy life.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness: The Legacy of Albert Ellis
 Michael E. Bernard
Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

When employed in counseling and therapy, the approach is called rational
emotive behavior therapy. It was created by Albert Ellis as a new way of helping
people who experience signiﬁcant emotional distress and interpersonal prob-
lems. As a guide for people with and without emotional difﬁculties, who seek
greater happiness and fulﬁllment, the approach is called rational living and
Albert Ellis was the ﬁrst to write about it in the 1960s.
The new, rational approach to modern-day living, which shall be referred to
throughout this book as REBT, involved Albert Ellis teaching people that they
are the center of their own universe, who are largely in control of their own
destinies and, in particular, who can control their own emotional well-being.
REBT, then, has dual goals: 1. To help people overcome their emotional
blocks and disturbances, and 2. To help them grow according to their own
goalsand designs,to become more fully functioning, moreself-actualizing
and happier than they would otherwise be.5
REBT is one of the most inﬂuentialformsof counseling and psychotherapy in
the world. As this book shows, REBT is being applied to a myriad of personal
problems and areas of everyday living including addiction and substance abuse,
adolescent and child problems, anger, assertion, communication, education,
executive leadership, health, law and criminality, love and marriage, medicine,
parenting, religion, self-discipline, sex, and sport.
Principles of rational living are the essential ingredients of a philosophy of
personal happiness that Ellis provides for people to help them to live enjoyable,
enriched, satisfying and pleasurable lives. Millions of people have proﬁted from
these principlesthat have helped them tothink, feel and act in ways that aidtheir
search for happiness. Ellis’ well-known self-help books have sold millions of
copies worldwide including his best seller, A New Guide to Rational Living, ﬁrst
published in 1961 written with Robert Harper and re-written in 1975.
Over many years of writing, public lecturing, and professional conferencing,
Ellis offered guidance for the general public on how to utilize their innate
capacity for rationality to live happier and more fulﬁlled lives. He founded the
Institutefor RationalLiving in New York City to serve this function. At the same
time, he operated the Institute for Rational Emotive Therapy (formerly the
Institute for the Advanced Study of Rational Emotive Psychotherapy) that
provides training for counselors and therapists with a focus on helping people
with mental health problems.
One of the unique and appealing aspects of Albert Ellis is that he discusses
both the philosophy of happiness and the psychology of and therapy for
emotional misery in a way that can be readily understood. When REBT is
practiced as a form of counseling or therapy, it is very educational without
relying on the extensive use of psychological jargon. Rather than analyzing early
childhood experiences and intra-psychic conﬂict amongst the id, ego, and
superego, Ellis spends his time with people in therapy showing them how to use
a very simple scientiﬁc method called the ABCs of REBT (see Chapter 3) in
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
2

order to think more scientiﬁcally and ﬂexibly about themselves, others, and
the world.
Ellis’ insights into the human psyche are often quite humorous, witty,
colorful, ribald, and provocative. He has discovered over the years that humor
is a key to helping people since emotional problems frequently come from
people taking themselves, others, and the world too seriously.
One of Ellis’ truly outstanding contributions is that, in his efforts to help people
live happier more productive lives, he has developed a theory which helps explain
why people have difﬁculty achieving happiness and self-fulﬁllment. In REBT, Ellis
offers basic insights into human nature. He reveals in a way no other contempo-
rary philosopher or psychologist has done that it is not only the irrationalities of
the outside world that create the conditions for people’s emotional distress and
unhappiness,butalso thatbecausepeoplearehuman,everybodyinheritsanatural
biological tendency for irrationality which leads them to upset themselves about
the unavoidable and inevitable irrationalities in our world.
One of the rational beliefs Ellis has identiﬁed asbeingcentralto rational living
is “acceptance.” As will be shown, people who do not accept reality as it presents
itself andwho instead, demand or insist thatconditions in theworld(world war,
economic insecurity, political bastardry, organized crime) absolutely should not
and must not exist will usually overly upset themselves about these conditions.
Their extreme emotionality, in turn, will make them less able to change
obnoxious and accept realistic conditions and to live happily even when
they cannot change them.
The Early Life and Times of Albert Ellis
How did I take my physical troubles (chronic nephritis) and restrictions?
Prettydamnedwell.Idislikedthembutremainedahappychild.IthinkIwas
happy because I coped well. I practically never whined and cried. I accepted
what I couldn’t change. I created good substitute enjoyments – mainly
mental ones. I habituated myself . . . to coping mechanisms. By taking the
challenge of doing so, I thereby mostly enjoyed my coping. My reasons for
being happy, however, stemmed not only from my congratulating myself
becauseIcopedsowell.Thecopingitselfstoppedmefrombeingmiserable–
as rational coping statements (and philosophies) usually do.
Coping statements themselves also often lead to happiness – because they
include alternate plans. Thus I told myself, “Yes, this damned nephritis is a
restricting problem and bad. But it’s not too bad or terrible. And though
hospitalizedforit,I’lllearnsomenewthingsaboutmyselfandlookforwardto

Albert Ellis and the Pursuit of Happiness

Albert Ellis was born of Jewish parents in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in
September of 1913. At a young age he moved to New York City and was raised
on the streets of the Bronx. He was the eldest of three children having a brother,
Paul, two years his junior and a sister, Janet, who was four years younger. In his
2004 book, Albert Ellis: Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy – It Works for Me – It
Can Work for You, he discussed his relationship with his parents and how he
coped with what he termed their “abysmal parental neglect.” Ellis stated that his
father was a travelling salesman who experienced minimal success at different
businesses. According to Ellis, he gave his children only minimum attention and
affection and was often away from home during their early childhood. Ellis
described his mother as self-centered whose emotions ran hot and cold. She
appeared to express strong but unsubstantiated opinions, rarely listened to the
opinion of others, and was thrown out of school in sixth grade for compulsive
talking. According to Ellis’ recollection, his mother was emotionally unem-
pathic and emotionally detached from all her children.
As a result of hismother’s neglectfulparenting, Ellisindicatedthathe assumed
some of the responsibilities for looking after his younger brother and sister
included getting them up and dressed for school each morning. During the
Depression, all the Ellis children took on part-time jobs to help the family cope
economically. These responsibilities he discharged efﬁciently without being
disturbed about them.
Of some signiﬁcance was Ellis’ poor health during his childhood. He suffered
from severe headaches and was also hospitalized with tonsillitis, which led to
severe strep throat requiring emergency surgery. He had eight hospitalizations
between the ages of ﬁve and seven. He suffered from nephritis (inﬂammation of
the kidney) and was hospitalized for almost a year. During this year, his mother
and father visited him infrequently. He reported that he successfully coped with
feelings of rejection, loneliness, and separation using a variety of coping
techniques including rational thinking (e.g., “I don’t like this. I wish my parents
would visit me more and that I would have other visitors too. How frustrating –
but it won’t kill me.”).
I would really have to start working myself up to be miserable. I’d have to
work hard at it, to practice again, disturbing myself. These days, I almost
automatically go after self-disturbances and quickly eliminate them. Not
squelch, suppress or repress them – I really mean really eliminate. And
because I have so little time and energy to expend at making myself
miserable, I derive considerable pleasure, enjoyment, and sometimes
sheer bliss out of my life. What more can one ask?22
Albert Ellis’ (Generally) Pleasurable and Happy
Personal Life
Instead of making myself incensed, I used REBT to make myself very
displeased with his behavior, but not angry at him by telling myself,
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness

“Too bad that he has lied, cheated, and procrastinated, but that rotten
behavior doesn’t make him a bad person.”22
EllisputREBTandprinciplesofrationallivingtogoodeffectthroughouthislife.
Using REBT, he managed to cope with his own issues of dating, mating,
separating, work, and dealing with life’s frustrations including other people’s
unprincipled, irrational behavior. He admits to battling problems with anger
throughout his life when people acted stupidly, immorally and in response to
“horrible” world conditions. He literally forced himself to practice what he
preached inREBTbylearningtoacceptthesinnerbutnotthesinsandtherebyto
refuse to feel enraged.
His evolving philosophy of rational happiness helped him to overcome
shyness and become assertive in his search for pleasure and satisfaction in
his relationships with others. To begin, Ellis helped himself overcome most of
his extreme feelings of desperation and possessiveness he brought to his
relationships, as can be seen below when he talks about his ﬁrst wife, Karyl.
Suddenly, I saw the way out of my dilemma. It was not my strong desire for
her that gave me so much trouble when it was not thoroughly fulﬁlled. No,
it was my dire need for her love. I foolishly believed that she absolutely had
to return my feelings in kind; and that and only that would solve our
problem. Well, that was horseshit! I saw that I could, if I wished, keep my
powerful desire, urge and love for Karyl – and I could simultaneously give
up my need, demand and insistence that she feel exactly the same way I did.
That was an astonishing thought, I could love without needing!21
For someone predominantly motivated to work and be creative, Albert Ellis
had full and, in several instances, long-standing and pleasurable love relation-
ships. He was married three times and had two partners in living together
arrangements (in his thirties with Gertrude and with Janet Wolfe for over 30
years beginning in his ﬁfties). When he was 90 years of age, he married for the
third time Debbie Joffee. Over this period of time, REBT helped him deal with
dating,mating,andtocopewithhisdivorces.Hehelpedridhimselfofanysexual
hang-upshehadbyunshamefullyacceptinghimselfwhenengagedinavarietyof
adventuresome, pleasure-seeking behavior (e.g., frotteurism) that did not harm
the welfare and wellbeing of different partners.
While Ellis admits to having been born and reared with a strong propensity to
make himself anxious and with relatively normal neurotic tendencies to depress
himself when things were going badly (e.g., breaking up with Gertrude), he was
able to use REBT to overcome feelings of anxiety and depression as well as his
anger.
Overtheyears,heusedREBTtohandle amyriad ofproblemsthatstoodinthe
way of his happiness including coping with parental neglect, his parents’
divorce, failing in his love affairs, failing at writing (numerous manuscripts
rejected by publishers), censorship of his work (his ﬁrst PhD thesis at Colombia

University; books banned in various US states) and poor health (e.g., diabetes,
poor eyesight, hearing impairment, hospitalizations).
I think I can say that I am one of the relatively few people in the United
States, and, perhaps in the entire world, who has not had a seriously
miserable day since I created REBT in 1955. I ﬁnd it almost impossible to
feel intensely depressed, hostile, or upset for more than literally a few
minutes at a time.21
Albert Ellis’ Professional Life was Self-actualized
Ellis earned a master’s degree in clinical psychology from Columbia University
in 1943 and a doctorate of philosophy from the same university in 1947. He
actively practiced clinical psychology and psychotherapy from 1943 and held
several important psychological positions including Chief Psychologist of the
New Jersey State Diagnostic Center, Chief Psychologist of the New Jersey State
Department of Institutions and Agencies and was a psychological consultant
to several organizations including the Veterans Administration and the New
York City Department of Education. He was the founder and Executive
Director of the Albert Ellis Institute (formerly the Institute of Rational-
Emotive Therapy) in New York City, a non-proﬁt educational foundation
that trains psychotherapists, runs an active psychological clinic, conducts self-
help workshops, and disseminates books, audiovisual, and other materials
on REBT.
Albert Ellis is one of the leading ﬁgures in modern psychology and is
comparable to Sigmund Freud and B.F. Skinner in his tremendous ability to
make friends and gain supporters and likewise arouse opponents and detractors.
He was ranked as one of the “most inﬂuential” psychologists by both the
AmericanandCanadianpsychologistsandcounselors’professionalassociations.
Albert Ellis has written or edited 75 books and monographs that have sold
millions of copies. Some of his best-known books include How to Live With a
Neurotic, Sex Without Guilt, The Encyclopaedia of Sexual Behavior, The Art and
Science of Love, Sex and the Single Man, Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy,
Overcoming Procrastination, A New Guide to Rational Living, and Anger: How to
Live with and Without It.
He has also published hundreds of articles in popular magazines including
Coronet, Cosmopolitan, Forum, Mademoiselle, Pageant, Parade, Penthouse,
Playboy, Psychology Today, The Realist, and The Independent. A signiﬁcant
amountofhiswritingshasbeentranslatedintomorethantwentylanguageswith
several of his books selling widely in many countries.
In addition to his publications, audio and video cassettes have also brought
REBT messages to the general public and some of these have also been best-
sellers including “How to Stubbornly Refuse to Be Ashamed of Anything,”
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
6

“Twenty-one Ways to Stop Worry,” “A Garland of Rational Songs,” and
“Twenty-two Ways to Brighten Up Your Love Life.”
Ellis has also had many special articles written on him published in many
leading newspapers and magazines including the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, Chicago Tribune, Philadelphia Inquirer, Baltimore Sun, Toronto Globe, St.
Louis Post-Despatch, People Magazine, and Psychology Today.
ThemainreasonsforEllis’signiﬁcant publicandprofessionalreputationover
a half century are his professional and scientiﬁc achievements in the ﬁelds of
psychology, psychotherapy, and philosophy. In 1985, Ellis was honored by the
American Psychological Association with its major award for Distinguished
Professional Contributions to Knowledge. Over the years he received special
awards
as
a
Distinguished

and

including the American Academy of Psychotherapists, Society for the Scientiﬁc
Study of Sex, American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and
Therapists, the Academy of Psychologists in Marital and Family Therapy,
the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy, the American
Psychopathological Association and the American Counseling Association.
One of the recognitions Ellis is most proud of is the Humanist of the Year
Award bestowed upon him in the early 1970s by the American Humanist
Association.
Ellis’ scientiﬁcstanding canbeseen inthe over 500 articles he has published in
psychological, psychiatric, and sociological journals. He is one of the most cited
authors in modern psychology.
Aside from his writing, Ellis popularized REBT over the years through his
appearances on hundreds of radio and talk shows, including Good Morning
America, The Today Show, The Dick Cavett Show, Phil Donahue, Merv Grifﬁn,
Mike Wallace, David Susskind and on ABC, NBC, and CBS News. Ellis was a
prominent public speaker and charismatic leader who gave over two thousand
lectures throughout the United States and overseas.
In his late eighties, Ellis continued to be one of the world’s most active
individual and group psychotherapists. During the ﬁnal three decades of his life
he saw over six thousand clients and regularly conducted more than eighty
individual sessions and a half-dozen or so group therapy sessions each week at
the Albert Ellis Institute which is located in New York City (Manhattan) at 45
East 65th Street. He actively supervised the training of several hundred
therapists a year and was one of the main teachers and supervisors of the
Albert Ellis Institute’s training programs that are still regularly held in New
York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and other leading American and
European cities. Ellis is famous for his Friday Night Workshop Therapy
demonstrations conducted at his Institute where, for 40 years, he has publicly
worked with over two thousand volunteers. He also gave many live demonstra-
tions of REBT at his other professional and public workshops over the years.
Over the past six decades, both the theory and practice of REBT including his
consideration of rational living has evolved and been reﬁned largely through
Albert Ellis and the Pursuit of Happiness
7

Ellis’ work. For a good many years, Ellis was alone in writing major treatises on
REBT but in recent years a good many books for the professional have been
published. REBT has reached the stage today where it provides a clear under-
standing andidentiﬁcationoftheself-defeatingaspectsofourthinkingaswellas
speciﬁc techniques for modifying our thinking, feeling, and behavior, so that we
are more readily able to achieve our goals in life.
Ellis Speaks Common Sense
One of the appealing qualities of REBT is that its basic assumptions make good
intuitive sense and, in fact, many people (including ancient philosophers as well
as past and contemporary well-known psychologists) have independently
ﬁgured out and created aspects of REBT.
A lot of people use the basics of REBT because they realize, after they
learn a little about it, that they independently discovered parts of it
themselves. That’s one thing about REBT I like in particular. I’ve been
promoting it ever since I invented it in 1955. And I realized when I
invented it that I derived it from philosophy. I’ve always been interested
in philosophy. After creating REBT, I went back and reread some
philosophy, including Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. Then I went
around the country talking to people, mainly professionals in the
beginning. I’d go out to the midwest, to the west, or north to
Canada and fairly frequently psychologists would come up to me and
say, “You know, Dr. Ellis, I really like this stuff and the reason I like it is
I’ve being doing something like it for years.” They hadn’t even read
philosophy but they ﬁgured it out in their own lives or with their clients.
They saw that it’s not the things that happen to us that upset us, it’s our
view of these events, which is what Epictetus said 2,000 years ago. On
their own, they had been practicing a form of REBT. Then I did some
more reading and found that Paul Dubois wrote two books on persua-
sive therapy in 1907. He was a Swiss psychiatrist who was unusually
rational. Aaron T. Beck, who apparently didn’t know about my earlier
writing, started publishing similar cognitive and rational material in
1963. Then I saw a few years later, when I kept reading the literature, that
if you read Freud, Jung, Reich, Perls, and especially Adler, that they all to
some extent used rational persuasion. But only Adler acknowledged this
while the others rarely did. I started realizing that if their clients
improved, it was because these analytic and experiential therapists would
throw in a lot of cognitive therapy and not acknowledge doing so. If
clients got better they’d say it was because they talked about their
goddamned mothers.
It really wasn’t because they talked about their mothers, because even
when they did so their therapists would say “Well, your mother did you
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
8

in, and she said you were a shit. But why do you now believe her?” They
pointed out “Why do you have to stay attached to your mother?” Now
that’s rational, but these therapists refused to give credit to the rational
methods they used.
So everybody who is reasonably sane – philosophers, psychologists,
therapists, etc. – do use considerable REBT. But they don’t acknowledge
it and barely recognize what they’re doing. (Ellis public lecture)
The Dual Nature of the Human Psyche
Recognize that you were born and raised with very strong tendencies to be
self-actualizing as well as self-defeating. You are able to think straight, to
be realistic and logical, and to ﬁgure out better solutions for yourself and
others. But you are also prone to go for short-range rather than long-range
gain. See yourself as a “normal” individual who has some destructive
behaviors but who can lead a happy existence in spite of them.17
One of the most unique insights of Ellis is the duality of human psychological
functioning. He theorized that all human beings have dual biological tendencies
that operate in opposition to one another and that explain much of the way the
mind operates including how people think, feel and act. There is the self-
defeating tendency he called irrationality as well as the self-enhancing tendency
he referred to as rationality (Ellis 1962, 1973, 1988, 1994, 1999, 2004). It is the
rational side of people’s psychological functioning that guides them in their
pursuit of happiness and self-fulﬁllment.
Theirrationaldimensionofpsychologicalfunctioningischaracterizedbyhigh
negative emotionality (e.g., anxiety, depression, anger, self-pity, guilt) and self-
defeating behavior (e.g., aggression, avoidance, procrastination, substance
abuse). The cognitive aspects of irrationality are dogmatic, rigid, unscientiﬁc
irrational beliefs and associated irrational thinking that Ellis referred to as
absolutizing or musterbation (e.g., Ellis 1962, 1994). Generally, when people
think irrationally about adverse situations and events and, as a consequence,
experienceextremeanger,anxiety,anddepression,theyexpresstheirpreferences,
desires, and wishes as demands, commands, shoulds, needs, oughts, and musts
(e.g., “because I prefer success, approval and/or comfort, I must be successful,
loved and/or comfortable”; “I must have what I want”). Ellis said there is a
biologicaltendencyofallhumanstogreater orlesserextentstothinkillogicallyas
seenintheirabsolutizing.Thinkinginabsolutesisgenerallyillogicalasitdoesnot
logically follow (non-sequitur) that because someone prefers or desires a set of
conditions to exist, they must (or must not) exist. Ellis also proposed additional
irrational thinking processes that derive from absolutizing including awfulizing
(blowing the badness of events out of proportion), I can’t-stand-it-itis (low
frustration tolerance) and global rating of self, others and the world.
Albert Ellis and the Pursuit of Happiness

Emotional misery, unhappiness, and avoiding important tasks of daily living
obstruct the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, according to Ellis, the
irrational side of the human psyche is often a stronger, more dominating
inﬂuence than the rational side.
It’s very interesting that leading psychologists, such as Carl Rogers and Abe
Maslow, point out correctly that we all have inborn self-fulﬁlling tenden-
cies:tendenciestoreason,toactualize,andtochangeourselves.Buttheyare
most reluctant to admit that we also have self-defeating tendencies.18
REBT assumes, then, that all humans are born with two basic tendencies,
which operate side by side throughout the life span and which appear to work in
opposite ways to each other. The ﬁrst is the self-actualization tendency that
involves the gradual unfolding of people’s innate potential as they achieve
greater self-acceptance and learn more about themselves and their possibilities.
The second tendency is irrationality and involves people’s tendency to think in
overly subjective,absolutistic, rigid, unclear,inaccurate,and self-defeatingways
about themselves, other people, and the world.
Ellis has always tried to help people to reduce their disturbances and increase
their happiness and fulﬁllment by helping them to use their rational faculties to
minimize their emotional miseries and to engage in the actions that bring them
pleasure, satisfaction, and fulﬁllment. Given the biological nature of irrational-
ity, Ellis has written about the impossibility of anyone attaining perfect mental
health.
Nature–Nurture
You always bring yourself and your innate tendencies to your environ-
ment. Many environmentalists and psychologists are too prejudiced to
acknowledge that you have an innate tendency to be gullible and suggest-
ible and to take your environment too seriously. If not, why did you listen
to your parents? Even if we say that you were impressionable because you
were young and couldn’t think for yourself, why did you continue to
believe crazy early teachings? Let’s face it, Barnum was right and you were
a sucker to begin with. Even if you were lucky enough to be raised without
parents, you’d invent your disturbing beliefs: that you need love and
achievement; that others must treat you fairly and kindly; and that life has
to be easy. These nutty ideas stem from profound innate tendencies which
your parents help exacerbate, but which they don’t create – except
biologically, with the wrong genes. (Ellis public lecture)
Whether irrationality is inherited biologically or whether it results from speciﬁc
early learning experiences that have been conditioned in people’s minds
through years of self-indoctrination is still to be proven.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
10

Ellis, who spent over sixty years studying the characteristics of people’s
thinking, concluded that irrationality is largely an imperfection of our mental
apparatus, an intermediate stage, perhaps, in the evolution of our logical
reasoning capacities. He argued persuasively that although the environment
in which people are raised can inﬂuence the way they think, people bring with
them, even from day one, ways of interpreting what they experience in that
environment.
Ellis also raised the question of how the same home environment can
produce children who differ so greatly in characteristics. Some children who
are born into very loving families turn out the “wrong way” in spite of home
support. One child may take a parent’s constructive comments to heart whereas
his or her sibling experiences the same comments as water off a duck’s back.
Similarly, some children born into harsh and rejecting families develop into
very happy and fulﬁlled people because of some rational “instinct” which
enables them to maintain some personal distance from the unpleasant aspects
of their home environment. Ellis reasons that the only way these differences in
children can occur is if children are born with thinking tendencies
that predisposes them to interpret their environment in certain rational or
irrational ways.
Ellis also argues that the biological tendency for irrationality explains why
people so frequently think, feel, and act in ways that they know prevent them
from achieving their basic goals in life and the fulﬁllment of their potential. If
their irrational thinking was exclusively learned from the environment (parent,
teachers, media) then by rights, especially given its self-defeating nature, this
thinking should be relatively easy, given sufﬁcient practice, to unlearn.
However, as any of us can observe from our own experience in trying to think
and act rationally and break unwanted habits such as smoking, excessive
drinking, or procrastination, there seems to be some force or urge that prevents
us from readily changing. The strength of our irrationality in the face of its self-
defeatingnatureispartoftheevidence Ellisusestohypothesize abiological basis
to irrationality.
Why are you crazy enough to believe your nutty, screwed-up father, who
tells you you’ve got to do well in everything that you do? You probably
have that tendency yourself and therefore you’re prone to agree with your
perfectionistic father. (Ellis public lecture)
The Purpose and Goals of Life
What people choose to do in life is naturally enough associated with the overall
goals and purposes they have for living. Ellis proposes the following goals and
purposes as those that most human beings in western societies would accept for
themselves.
Albert Ellis and the Pursuit of Happiness
11

Ellis proposed that the most general and far-reaching goal people have and
share in common is to live a long and happy life. According to Ellis, the
attainment of this goal is facilitated when three conditions (or sub-goals) exist:
(1) People are achieving to the best of their ability in their chosen ﬁeld of work
endeavor that they ﬁnd interesting and absorbing; (2) People are involved in
satisfying and loving relationships with signiﬁcant others (partner, family,
friends, social group); and (3) People experience a minimum of needless
pain and emotional misery as well as a maximum of comfort and pleasure.
Ellis recognizes that there are many different life strategies or personal
philosophies that determine how people go about realizing these goals and
purposes. Which one works best is an open question. That is, it is impossible to
say in any ﬁnal, absolute sense, which approach will be most beneﬁcial for an
individual.
Ellis’ theory on the pursuit of happiness is not entirely objective and value
free. Once the goals of long life, happiness, success, comfort, and love are chosen
and Ellis sees these general purposes as matters of choice rather than as absolute
givens – then Ellis proposes “best” ways for people to think, feel, and behave
including principles of rational living (see Chapter 4). Whether these ways of
thinking, feeling, and behaving work for most of the people most of the time can
be determined.
Happiness
Strive for the long-range pleasure of tomorrow as well as the short-range
satisfactions of today.10
Ellis’ guide to rational living encourages people to experiment with their life-
style and make choices based on personal knowledge and discovery that would
bring them higher levels of excitement, passion, pleasure, and zest in the short-
term as well as pleasure, satisfaction and fulﬁllment in the long-term.
Creative, intensely absorbing activity, proves one of the mainstays of
happy, human living.15
Ellis has said that while some people may experience signiﬁcant pleasure and
enjoyment of passive involvements such as watching television and reading the
paper, most people tend to experience the highest levels of happiness both in the
short-term and long-term when they actively participate in creative and vitally
absorbing activities.
Overcoming human inertia to experiment and discover individual pursuits
and partners that bring pleasure and satisfaction in the short- and long-term
and,then,maintainingandextendingtheseinvolvements,isacardinal principle
underpinning Ellis’ view on the successful pursuit of personal happiness.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
12

In recent years, scientists studying happiness have distinguished between
eudaemonichappiness(ﬁndingpurposeorgoodnessinlife;livinglifetoitsfullest
potential) and hedonic happiness(pleasureseeking;avoidance of pain).Hedonic
happinessisclosein meaningto“subjective well-being”andconsistsofthethree
components of: (1) frequent positive emotions, (2) infrequent negative emo-
tions, and (3) high life satisfaction.
Ellis would say that the exercise of rationality through the application of
principles of rational living helps people to attain the three aspects of
subjective well-being. People are likely to experience higher degrees of life
satisfaction through deployment of rational principles in daily living includ-
ing people creatively experimenting and discovering what brings them
pleasure, what activities they enjoy, and which pursuits bring them satisfac-
tion and fulﬁllment. As a means of reducing negative affect, people learn how
to use the REBT scientiﬁc method for cognitively restructuring irrational to
rational beliefs. He has also said that rationality helps people to self-manage
and direct the process of self-actualization frequently resulting in eudaemonic
happiness.
In the short-term, Ellis considered happiness to be synonymous with the
feelings of enjoyment and pleasure. In his early days, he, perhaps, was most
known for his pioneering work in sex and helping liberate people from
conventional attitudes towards sexual experience. He provided people advice
not only in therapy but also in his many self-help books (e.g., The Encyclopaedia
of Sexual Behavior, Sex without Guilt, The Art and Science of Love) on sexual
gratiﬁcation including different ways to become sexually excited and to achieve
orgasm. Consider the following topics he wrote about: “Kinds of Sexual
Outlets,” “Physical and Psychological Methods for Arousing a Sex Partner,”
and “Sexual Intercourse: Main Positions.”
While this material today may seem tame to some, in the 1960s in the United
States it caused quite a stir – to the point where some of Ellis’ books were banned
inseveralUSstates.Butmoreimportantly,hiswordsbyblowingawaytheclouds
of ignorance, helped transform the sexual lives and fulﬁllment of literally
hundreds of thousands of people.
Ellis did not restrict his ideas on how to increase one’s short-term happiness
tothe pleasuresof the body. He encouragedpeople toexperience lifetoits fullest
in diverse areas of their potential interest to see what they would ﬁnd stimulat-
ing, exciting and, yes, pleasurable.
In his book with Irving Becker published in 1961, A Guide to Personal
Happiness, Ellis provides areas of potential enjoyable activities and pursuits.
These include aesthetic appreciation, exercising, fantasizing, food activities
(cooking, reading cookbooks), games (anagrams, cards), handicraft activities
(basket-making, crocheting, embroidering), humorous activities (cartooning,
joke telling, practical jokes), martial arts (judo, karate), mechanical activities
(carpentry, ﬁxing appliances), outdoor activities (backpacking, bicycling, bird
watching, camping, picnicking), performing arts (acting, ballet, debating),
reading (browsing, reading ﬁction, poetry), relaxing activities (bathing,

13

massaging, meditating), socializing (dinner parties, conversations), sports
(playing basketball, ping-pong, jogging, gym work), traveling (foreign local
trips),writingactivities(letters,shortstories,poems)andvolunteeringactivities
(for charitable groups, hospitals and not-for-proﬁt organizations).
Ellis was equally if not more interested in helping people achieve satisfaction
and fulﬁllment in the long-term. For Ellis, long-term happiness is a by-product
of people achieving their goals and purposes in life, namely: (1) using one’s
strengthsofcharacterandpersonality traits, including rationalitytoachieveand
excel at work (employment) and in other endeavors (hobbies); (2) relying on
one’s social competences and rationality to experience loving relationships that
endure with one or more signiﬁcant others including partner/spouse, family
and close friends; and (3) through the use of personal coping resources,
including rational thought, experiencing minimum periods of heightened,
negative emotionality and stress as a consequence of environmental adversity
of one form or another (e.g., lack of achievement, loss of loved one, frustrating
circumstances including deprivation and over-stimulation).
While Ellis would say that sustained levels of accomplishment at work
and other avocations including satisfying loving relationships that provide
individuals opportunities for emotional health (minimum emotional dis-
tress) are possible without large doses of rationality, he is a strong believer
that by developing one’s capacity for rationality, and applying a rational
mindset to daily living, self-actualization and long-term happiness would be
maximized.
Self-actualization
Increased happiness and freedom from disturbance can be achieved
because all humans are born with constructive and creative tendencies
and are also born with the ability to sharpen and increase their self-
fulﬁlling tendencies.9
Ellis says that biologically, all humans are born with a drive to develop their
innate potentialities. The drive which Ellis and other humanistic psychologists
refers to as the self-actualizing instinct or tendency results in high levels of
happiness and satisfaction when the individual discovers areas of living where
they can express their unique talents and aptitudes and achieve fulﬁllment.
One of the main goals of people’s actualizing themselves can be for them
to seek for more spontaneous ways of living. And one main by-product of
letting themselves spontaneously (and risktakingly) try new pursuits will
often be to discover new enjoyments and then tomake reaching them their
planned future goals. Experimentation is partly goal-seeking; and goal-
seeking partly is spontaneously experimenting with new endeavours.18
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
14

Ellis has indicated that to actualize themselves more fully, people had better
choose to work at achieving more growth, development, and happiness. That is,
to become more fully functioning (self-actualized), people should consciously
choose the goal or purpose of becoming more fully functioning.
Ellis strongly endorses a self-actualizing, action-oriented philosophy and
posits important ways self-actualization can be achieved. One of the main ways
to be self-actualizing (as will be discussed below) is to seek more spontaneous
ways of living to discover new enjoyments and then to make re-achieving them a
future goal.Theseenjoymentsincludebecomingvitallyabsorbedinintrinsically
interesting pursuits and activities both at work and in other areas of life.
Normally, self-actualization involves the pursuit of excellence and enjoyment –
whichever people choose to desire and emphasize.
To make themselves more fully functioning, people had better ask
themselves: “What do I choose as my life purpose?” “What do I really
like and dislike?” “How can I experiment and discover what I truly prefer,
and prefer not to do?” “Which of my likes (e.g. smoking) and dislikes (e.g.
exercising) will probably be self-harming as well as enjoyable?” By acting
on this information, people can push themselves to greater self-
actualization.14
Ellis does not believe in a transcendental or mystical self to self-actualize
that achieves higher, miraculous states of consciousness. Rather, continuous
experimentation and discovering of what one enjoys doing and discovering
ways of achieving success at work and in relationships leads a person to
develop their unique human, biological potential and results in satisfaction
and fulﬁllment.
General self-actualization involves the pursuit of excellence or enjoyment in
whatever ways an individual chooses to desire and emphasize. Healthy, enjoy-
able and maximally enjoyable pursuits differ from culture to culture, individual
to individual.
So push your way into self-fulﬁllment. If you will, take care to realize
exactly what is truly actualizing for you. The best watchwords seem to be:
experimenting, risk-taking and adventuring. By all means try to make
yourself emotionally healthier, happier, and more fulﬁlled. These goals
overlap considerably. But evaluate your chosen goals carefully, and be
ready to retreat when you obtain doubtful or harmful results.17
Ellis’ ﬁnal word on self-actualization is that “musterbation and self-fulﬁll-
ment is not very self-fulﬁlling.” Attempting to be fully or perfectly self-actualized
can be self-sabotaging. Don’t push self-actualization too hard. Don’t take goals
to extremes.To try frantically to get whatyou wantyou may neglect others, to be
hated by them, and to harm the social group.
Albert Ellis and the Pursuit of Happiness

You don’t easily achieve self-actualization when you are disturbed . . .
Achieving emotional health and self-actualization are goals that overlap
but are not quite the same. . . . But even if you are hardly ever miserable,
you may still be far from happy and self-actualizing. So, REBT helps you,
ﬁrst, to be less disturbed and, second, to discover what you really enjoy in
life. It then helps you to get more of that and to discover what you really
dislike and helps you to get less of that.15
Ellis Abandons Self-esteem
Your self-esteem is a ﬁction. Ego is a ﬁction. You’d better not have self-
esteem. It’s the greatest sickness known to humans because it really means
“I give myself a good rating because I perform welland amapproved.” Self-
denigration is worse, but self-esteem is still a measure, a rating of an entire
person – and therefore false. It depends on your doing the right thing, and
when you do the wrong thing, back to shithood you go. (Ellis public
lecture)
Contradictory as it may sound, Ellis argues that people’s self-esteem is a major
obstacle to the attainment of happiness. Here’s how he explains it.
The human condition impels you to foolishly rate yourself. Almost
everyone does that and I don’t think they do it from upbringing. I think
they do it because that’s what they naturally do.
Why do you think people rate themselves? What’s their goal? Why do
they measure their speaking, loving, tennis playing, and test-taking, and
use this measure to rate their being, their essence? The main reason you
rate yourself is to be grandiose – to get into heaven – to be holier than thou,
better than others, superhuman. You want to prove that you are the only
one to sit on the right side of God. Your sought-after pay-off is nobility. “I
am going to be the noblest Roman of them all. I’m going to do exactly the
right thing and be deiﬁed. You shits are allowed to fail and be disapproved.
But not ME!”
Inferiority is just inferiority. Someone may be taller than you or a better
player than you and then you’d be inferior with regard to that trait or
ability. But feelings of inferiority mean you’re putting yourself down for
some inferiority characteristic. Feelings of inferiority or worthlessness
usually stem from the two main irrational beliefs: “I must do well or
perfectly well and I must win your approval! Else I am worthless!”
Shouldhood equals shithood. Instead of trying to prove yourself, you’d
better try to be yourself and enjoy yourself! (Ellis public lecture)
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
16

Ellis nominates unconditional self-acceptance to replace self-esteem. Here, he
counsels people to call on their rationality to accept themselves as fallible people
who will from time-to-time make mistakes and be disapproved of or rejected by
others. He also encourages people to work hard at self-improvement.
Healthy (and happy) people are usually glad to be alive and accept
themselves because they are alive and have some capacity to enjoy
themselves. They refuse to measure their intrinsic worth by their extrinsic
achievement or by what others think of them. They frankly choose to
accept themselves unconditionally; and they try to completely avoid
rating themselves – their totality or their being. They attempt to enjoy
rather than prove themselves.16
Finding Happiness: No Apologies Needed
Ellis says that anyone who tries to give you a prescription by which you can
always feel happy, speaks foolishly or knavishly. Happiness, or a positive feeling
of pleasure, joy, or elation, tends to be a by-product of what people do, and
people cannot easily gain it by prescription. What you as a unique human
individual do and how much pleasure you get from doing it largely depends on
your personal preferences, which others cannot very well predict. How much
pleasureyou getfromgoingon awalkor sleeping withyour spouse isindividual.
As people are biologically, socially, and culturally different from all other
human beings, Ellis indicates that happiness-advisors, coaches and psycholo-
gists had better not be too presumptive and try to tell people what they can most
enjoy and how to go about achieving pinnacles of pleasure. In most ways, this is
for the individual, and no one but the individual, to discover.For almost six
decades, Ellis has advocated that you have the right, as a unique person, to
choose to seek self-actualization.
If you look for an absorbing interest, try to ﬁnd persons or activities in
which you can honestly absorb yourself for your own sake. . . . You have a
right as a human with your own personal tastes, to devote yourself
“selﬁshly” to an avocation – such as coin collecting or restoring antique
cars – that has little “social” value.18
As will become evident throughout this book, there is a journey that people
can take that can help them to become happier and more fulﬁlled. In some ways
the journey is already chartered and in other ways the journey requires self-
discovery.
Ellismaintainedthatthere aresome commonalitiesinthereasonswhypeople
experience emotional barriers to happiness in the form of anger, anxiety, and
depression. Most people experience these blockers to some extent and to greater

or lesser degrees. Insofar as this is the case, everyone can beneﬁt from taking the
time (journey) to a gain greater understanding of what Ellis considers to be the
primary cause of poor emotional health and to learn a set of techniques for
becoming less unhappy and achieving emotional health. This journey is well
demarcated with people from all backgrounds beneﬁtting. For Ellis, the root
cause of emotional distress is neither people’s unconscious conﬂicts with
parents nor past nor present negative interactions with difﬁcult people and
environmentalhardship.Rather,Ellisexplainsemotionaldistressintermsofthe
way people perceive and interpret their relationships with their parents or with
the environment. As will be revealed in the following chapter, according to Ellis,
it is people’s innate tendency towards absolutistic thinking (e.g., “Because
I prefer you to treat me considerately, you must be so at all times.” “Because I
prefer success and approval, I should be successful and approved of in all
important activities.”) that he considers to be the core feature of irrationality
and the central cause of emotional unhappiness. Thinking in terms of what you
prefer rather than must have increases the probability of achieving your goals.
The range of techniques for eliminating irrationality is reviewed in Chapter 3.
However, Ellis is quite clear in his assertion that reduced emotional unhap-
piness and increased emotional health is necessary, but not sufﬁcient for us to
achieve happiness and fulﬁllment. For Ellis, there is another journey that needs
to be taken. Here, the speciﬁc direction is less well charted. Because of the wide
range of differences amongst people in terms of their interests, desires and
pleasures,thepursuitofhappinessneedstobemoreexperimental,including the
need to take risks. The journey towards happiness can be made more efﬁcient if
the captain of the ship (you) are employing your capacity for rationality to its
fullest. As will be described in Chapter 4, there are several principles of
rationality that Ellis offer to help people to think, feel and act in ways that
help them discover more ways to enjoy life and have a ball.
Some say life’s satisfactions come naturally, spontaneously, if you stop
pushing the river and merely take things as they come, unplanfully,
effortlessly. How did the great sages who said this arrive at this marvelous
secret of human felicity? By substantial thought and effort!!15
A ﬁnal and very important point that Albert Ellis makes about happiness is
that, for many people, happy is not achieved through inertia and inactivity.
Happiness does not fall in your lap because you are deserving. Rather, it is
generally an outcome of work and practice in discovering those things you do
well and enjoy doing (and those that you do not).

Why We Get Unhappy
One of the ﬁrst expounders of REBT was Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher,
who said 2,000 years ago in very plain Roman (actually he was originally
Greek, but he was captured by the Romans and wrote in Roman), “It’s
never the things that happen to us which upset us. It’s our view of these
things.” Unhappiness actually seems to consist of at least two distinct
elements: (1) A feeling of sadness, sorrow, irritation, annoyance or regret
at your not getting what you want or at your getting what you do not want;
and (2) A second and quite different feeling of anxiety, depression, shame
or rage because (a) you see yourself as deprived or balked and (b) foolishly
convince yourself that you should not, must not, suffer frustration and
that things remain horrible and awful because you have suffered. (Ellis
public lecture)
What is Unhappiness?
You create both appropriate and inappropriate feelings when your goals
and desires are thwarted.17
Ellis discusses two forms of unhappiness that you can experience when con-
fronted with adversity and conditions that frustrate you from achieving your
goals; what he has sometimes referred to as healthy and unhealthy unhappiness.
Ellis counsels the importance of being able to be aware and to distinguish
between these self-induced emotional reactions.

Ellisconsidersthestrongfeelingsofsadness,irritation,andconcernashealthy
forms of unhappiness because they help people to express their displeasure
at undesirable happenings and work at modifying them. However, Ellis views
strong feelings of anxiety, depression and anger as almost always harmful
because they are painful to experience and because of their disruptive effects on
people’s thinking about the undesirable happening and on their behavior.
One of the major misunderstandings people have about REBT is that its goal
is to do completely away with all human emotions and that it will lead people to
becoming highly logical, objective, and mechanical.
Ellis views some form of negative emotions as healthy and appropriate and
that positive emotions are essential and pleasurable qualities of human experi-
enceaswellasextremelyimportantformotivation.REBTstrivesforappropriate
kinds of negative emotions, rather than excessive emotion, or no emotion at all.
Emotions are good. Emotions aren’t irrational. Many psychotherapists
think that emotions are irrational but they don’t think straight. Emotions
are either appropriate or inappropriate. When you feel sorry and annoyed
and regretful and disappointed when something has gone wrong in your
life or you have been dealt with unjustly, it’s very sane. That’s very
appropriate. You’d better feel that way. Even to feel very sorry may be ﬁne.
You’d better not feel overjoyed and you’d better not feel indifferent when
you do badly, because they won’t help you, those feelings. Appropriate
feeling means appropriate to your desires to survive and be happy.
Inappropriate negative feelings are deﬁned in REBT as those emotions,
such as feelings of depression, anxiety, despair, and worthlessness that
tend to make obnoxious conditions and frustrations worse, rather than to
help overcome them. Appropriate positive emotions result when partic-
ular goals or ideas are realized and when human preferences are satisﬁed.
They include love, happiness, pleasure, and curiosity, all of which tend to
increase human longevity and satisfaction. Positive inappropriate feelings
such as grandiosity are seen as those that temporarily tend to make people
feel good or feel superior to others, but sooner or later lead to unfortunate
results and greater frustrations, such as ill-judged risk-taking. (Ellis public
lecture)
So, for example, being very concerned about a forthcoming presentation is
an appropriate, healthy albeit negative emotion whereas extreme anxiety or
panic is an inappropriate and unhealthy negative emotion. Strong irritation
towards your mate’s ongoing selﬁsh behavior would be a healthy and appro-
priate negative emotion because it would motivate taking positive steps to
change your mate’s behavior; whereas, anger and rage are seen as unhealthy and
inappropriatenegativeemotionsbecauseoftheireffectonyourbehaviorsuchas
aggression and hostility. Such behavior can often provoke an escalation of
conﬂict. Sadness over the loss of someone you have been dating over a period of

time is a healthy and appropriate negative emotion and would not prevent you
fromseekingnewcompanionship;whereas,gettingandstayingdepressedabout
beingrejectedisunhealthy,negative,andnotappropriateasdepressionnotonly
feels especially bad but your behavior when depressed such as withdrawal from
social encounters can sabotage your goals of ﬁnding a loving relationship.
Thinking Makes It So
Ellis’ REBT theory accepts the importance of emotions and behaviors but
particularly emphasizes the role of thinking in human problems. It has a long
philosophic history as it was partially stressed by ancient thinkers, such as
Confucius and Gautama Buddha, and it was especially noted, in startling clear
form, by the ancient Stoic philosophers such as Zeno of Citium Chrysippus,
Panaetius of Rhodes, Cicero, Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. In less
ancient times, Shakespeare captured the REBT viewpoint in Hamlet: “There’s
nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.”
REBT has as its basic assumption that the main causes of both healthy and
unhealthy negative and positive emotions are your irrational beliefs and
thoughts about events in your life. Said another way, your feelings and behaviors
are largely consequences of your rational and irrational beliefs about some event.
Let’s for the moment consider 100 married couples, all similar in important
characteristics such as number of years married, degree of marital satisfaction,
employment situation, money in the bank, in-laws, etc. Now, consider how
these 100 husbands might react to the situation of each of them having an
argument with their wife and their wife screaming at them: “If you don’t start to
pull your weight around this house and give me a hand with the chores, we’re
through!” The question Ellis invites you to consider is whether all 100 husbands
would feel the same in response to the same event. Most people would agree that
the100husbandswouldreactdifferently.Somewouldfeeldevastatedoranxious
about the prospect of being left and might try to be more conscientious.
Others might feel extremely angry about being yelled at and of perhaps, being
unfairly accused and try even less. A few masochists might actually be happy.
Now, argues Ellis, if people’s emotions are caused by events, then all of the 100
husbands would experience exactly the same emotion. As they patently feel very
different about their wife’s comment, then something else beside the event is
apparently exerting a strong inﬂuence over their different feelings. And as you’ll
see in the transcript that follows, Ellis concludes that it is people’s different
beliefs, attitudes, and thoughts about the event that determines their feelings.
Ellis makes the case that unhealthy happiness as experienced in anxiety,
depression, and anger almost always stems from irrational commands that
unpleasant events absolutely must not exist, that you should always perform
successfully, that people must always love and approve of you, or that people
should always treat you fairly and considerately.
Why We Get Unhappy
21

While Ellis strongly emphasizes the role of thinking as largely causing and
creating emotion and behavior, he does acknowledge that all three forms of
humanexperiencesareallcloselyrelatedandnoneofthemtendstoexistwithout
the other two.
Probably, no such thing as “pure” or “absolute” thought, feeling or action
exists. Thoughts or evaluations (“I see this as a good chess move and I like
it”) are almost invariably accompanied by and interact with feelings
(happiness or elation at considering or having made this “good” move)
and are also accompanied by and interact with actions (making a
particular chess move). Similarly, feelings (pleasure at making and
thinking about this “good” move) lead to thoughts (“What a good player
I am for making it”) and to actions (readying oneself to follow the move
with other “good” moves). And actions (making the chess move) lead to
thoughts (“That’s a great move! I’m glad I made it!”) and to feelings
(pleasure or elation). (Ellis public lecture)
Ellis recognizes that some emotions can be signiﬁcantly contributed to or
“caused” by outside events or physiological factors although such emotional
reactionsarenormallyaccompaniedbycontributingthoughtsandbeliefs.Thus,
if people are caught in an earthquake or if they experience powerful hormonal
change and they therefore become upset, their outside events and physiological
processesprobablystronglyinﬂuencethemtocreateirrationalthoughts,suchas
“This earthquake shouldn’t have occurred! Isn’t it awful! I can’t stand it!” or,
“It’s unfair that my period makes me feel so lousy. Life shouldn’t be so unfair.
I can’t stand it!” These thoughts, in turn, add to or help create feelings of
depression in the ﬁrst instance and anger in the second.
Irrational Thinking
I think that practically the whole human race is out of its goddamned
mind and could use therapy. All of them, not equally so, are all crazy.
Males and females are biologically prone to think crookedly. They don’t
get it from their mothers. They think crookedly because they are easily
prone to do so. They have difﬁculty behaving straightly. All humans are
somewhat nutty because they refuse pigheadedly to accept reality and,
therefore, make themselves depressed, anxious, and enraged. Because they
won’t accept the reality that things should be exactly the way they are right
now because that’s the way they are. Now I’m not saying it’s good that
they’re that way, it’s bad, often quite crummy. So it’s crummy. But that’s
the way it is . . . And we have tons of evidence showing the enormous
irrationality of most humans. Do you know what that evidence is? Most
people often do all kinds of asinine things like overeat, smoke, overdrink,
use cocaine, and procrastinate. (Ellis public lecture)
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
22

While you may take exception to Ellis’ notion that practically everyone has
emotional problems, you will come to understand in this book that he views
disturbance as existing any time you think, feel, and act in ways which actually
prevent rather than help you achieve what you want for yourself in life; for
example, wasting time, eating or drinking too much, losing your temper, or
worrying excessively about failure or disapproval. Ellis would say that at these
times you act crazily because not only are you being inefﬁcient, but also
because you are sabotaging your own basic goals in life – especially if your
goals include long life, a minimum of emotional upset and self-defeating
behavior, the development of your unique potential, and happiness. So Ellis
uses the word “craziness” to cover a multitude of acts you commit which harm
yourself and others.
The core of all emotional difﬁculties – be they feelings of rage, depression,
anxiety,guilt, or extreme jealousy –isaperson’s irrational belief system.Asyou’ll
see, your irrational belief system consists of a range of different erroneous
assumptions, unrealistic expectations, demands, and evaluations that people
bring to situations. The unique and self-defeating aspect of irrational beliefs is
their strong“absolutistic”quality orwhatEllis callsvariously“demandingness,”
“shoulding” or “musturbation.”
The REBT theory of absolutistic thinking can be partially traced to the work
of the anti-Freudian psychoanalyst, Karen Horney, who noted in 1945 that
inner conﬂicts stem from a “tyranny of the shoulds.” In essence, people upset
themselves by their own unrealistic expectations and ideal standards which they
hold but which thy can never reach because of their own inherent fallibilities as
well as the unreasonableness of the standards themselves. This is how Ellis
explains the role of “demandingness” to his clients. Helen is a thirty-three-year-
old schoolteacher who is seeking relief from her feelings of inadequacy and
anxiety.
ELLIS:
Let me give you a model which I frequently give to my clients the
ﬁrst session and if you understand the model – which I’m sure you
will – you’ll see how humans upset themselves. You leave here soon
and imagine that you don’t know how much money you have in
your purse or pocket. Imagine that you’re totally ignorant. You
could have a dollar or you could have ﬁfty thousand. You just don’t
know and you’re only saying one single thing to yourself: “I wish, I
prefer to have minimum of ten dollars. Not a hundred, not two
hundred, just ten. I wish. I’d like, I prefer to have a minimum of
ten.” That’s all that you’re saying to yourself. Then you look in your
pocket and you ﬁnd nine instead of ten. Now, how would you feel
if you preferred ten and had nine? What would your feeling be?
HELEN:
Well, I’d just as soon have nine and that’s it.
ELLIS:
So you wouldn’t feel very upset?
HELEN:
No.
Why We Get Unhappy
23

ELLIS:
You’d feel slightly disappointed.
HELEN:
Yes, but not upset.
ELLIS:
Not upset at all. Right, now the second time – forget about the ﬁrst
time – this time you’re going out, this time you’re devoutly saying to
yourself and really believing “I absolutely must have a minimum
guarantee of ten dollars at all times, a guaranteed ten. I have to, I
must, I’ve got to!” And you believe that. Then again you look in your
purse or pocket and again you ﬁnd nine. Now how would you feel if
you must have ten and you only have nine?
HELEN:
Very frustrated, angry, and depressed.
ELLIS:
Yes, you’d be off the wall and quite disturbed because of your must.
Finally, here is the end of the model. The third time you go out
imagine that you’re saying the same stupid, devout thing to yourself
as the second time: “I absolutely must have a minimum guarantee of
ten dollars at all times, I must, I must, I must!” Then you look in your
purse or pocket and ﬁnd eleven. Now how would you feel?
HELEN:
Really excited and happy.
ELLIS:
Right,reallygrateful.“Ineedaminimumoften,Inowhavemorethan
ten. Great!” But a minute later, with the eleven dollars still in your
purse – you haven’t lost it – something would occur to you, to panic
you. Why would you panic? You’ve still got the eleven and you’re
overjoyed about it. Why would you then panic?
HELEN:
Maybe because I’ll lose some.
ELLIS:
That’s right. “I now have a minimum of ten, more than ten. I’ve got
eleven. But I must have a guarantee of ten at all time! Suppose I spend
two, suppose I lose two, suppose I get robbed. All of which can
happen!” You see there are no guarantees.
Now this model shows that anybody in the whole universe – a
thousand years ago, today, a thousand years from now, black or
white, young or old, male or female, rich or poor, good family or
rottenfamily,thesethingsdon’tmatter,anyonewhotakesadesirefor
anything, I used money to make it simple but it could be love,
schooling, or success – and makes it into a must, a guarantee, ﬁrst is
miserable whenshedoesn’thavewhatshethinks shemustandsecond
ispanickedwhenshedoeshaveit.Becauseshecouldalwaysloseit.Do
you see that this is true?
HELEN:
Yes, you’re right. I now see it.
For the remainder of the session, Ellis discussed with Helen her dire need for
approval and her demand to be perfect.
Another way of stating this is to say that all humans have desires and
preferences for certain things which they wish to obtain to achieve their goals
in life. Some people wish to achieve mightily or be strongly approved of by
signiﬁcant people in their lives. Others strongly prefer that people act fairly,
kindly,andconsideratelytowardsthem.Stillothersmayhavestrongpreferences
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
24

that life be comfortable, fun, and easy. Many persons make trouble for
themselves by converting or generalizing their wishes into absolute commands,
demands, shoulds, oughts, or musts. The irrational and illogical aspect of this
type of thinking involves them saying to themselves “Because I want something
(achievement, love, fairness, comfort), I must have it.”
You’re sneaking in, “because it’s preferable, I have to get what I want.” And
when I ask you “Why do you have to?” You reply, lightly, “I don’t have to.”
But underneath, to yourself, you still strongly say, “But I really should get
what I want!”
And that’s the human condition. Humans continually do that. If they
want a thing lightly, they say “Oh well, if I don’t get it, I don’t get it.” But if
they want it strongly and it’s quite important, they sneak in, “therefore I
must have it!” And that’s a non sequitur, it doesn’t follow. As long as you
asininely stick to absolutistic shoulds, oughts, and musts, you’re cooked for
the rest of your life. You’re depressed when you don’t get what you must
and still panicked (about next time) when you do! (Ellis public lecture)
When people take a preference and make it into an absolute should or must
whatthey really mean isthattheymusthavewhatthey preferor want 100percent
of the time and under all conditions. And this will get them into emotional hot
water because for the most part, nothing in life comes with a guarantee.
Absolutes are not realizable in reality. For example, suppose you say to
yourself, “I must always achieve in my work.” What you mean is that not only is
itpreferableforyoutoachieve(forinallprobabilityyouwillbehappierifyouare
achieving), but you also mean, “No matter what, at all times, I must achieve. It’s
awful to make mistakes. I can’t stand not achieving. I must be a real idiot, fool,
hopeless, when I don’t achieve perfectly!” And when you don’t achieve at a
certain point in time (as you inevitably won’t), you will be plagued with
excessive anxiety, self-downing, or frustration which will not only make you
unhappier in life, but also frequently interfere with your future attempts to
overcome your personal imperfections and do better at work.
Not only has Ellis discovered that people’s beliefs are at the root of their
emotional problems, but he has also been able to identify two different types of
beliefs: irrational beliefs which cause emotional distress and maladaptive
behavior, and rational beliefs which help us to maintain emotional control
and behave appropriately.
Irrational Beliefs that Create Unhappiness
In his book with Robert Harper, A New Guide to Rational Living, Ellis
enumerates 10 irrational beliefs and faulty assumptions people hold that create
emotional unhappiness. He contrasts these with rational beliefs and
Why We Get Unhappy
25

“empirically based” assumptions that help people in learning how to reﬂect and
think about themselves, others and circumstances in their lives. Here’s Ellis’ list.
As you read through the irrational beliefs, you can pay particular attention to
those you endorse and their likely consequences.
1
Irrational belief: I must have the love or approval from all people I ﬁnd
signiﬁcant.
Consequences: social anxiety,stress, dependent behavior, social avoidance.
Rational belief: While it is desirable for me to be approved of and loved,
I do not need it to survive. It is most desirable to concentrate on self-
acceptance and on loving instead of being loved.
2
Irrational belief: I must be thoroughly competent, adequate, and
achieving.
Consequences: performance anxiety and fear of failure, stress, perfection-
ism, task avoidance, compulsive behavior.
Rational belief: It is more advisable to accept myself as an imperfect
creature with human limitations and fallibilities. It is often better to do
than to do well.
3
Irrational belief: When people act obnoxiously and unfairly, I should
blame and damn them and see them as bad, wicked, or rotten individuals.
Consequences: extreme anger, hostility along with negative consequences
suffered for your aggressive behavior.
Rational belief: People often behave unfairly, stupidly and inconsiderately
and it would be better if they were helped to change their ways rather than
to be severely damned and punished. It is not legitimate to rate their total
worth on the basis of their individual acts.
4
Irrational belief: Things are awful, terrible, and catastrophic when I get
seriously frustrated, treated unfairly, or rejected.
Consequences: extreme and inappropriate negative emotions such as rage
and depression.
Rational belief: While it is undesirable to fail to get what I want, it is seldom
awful or intolerable.
5
Irrational belief: Emotional misery comes from external pressures and I
have little ability to control or change my feelings.
Consequences: blaming others, anger, helplessness, external locus of
control, arguments, and hostile interpersonal behavior.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
26

Rational belief: Because I mainly create my own emotional upsets, I can
change them by thinking more rationally.
6
Irrational belief: If something seems dangerous or fearsome, I must
preoccupy myself with and make myself anxious about it.
Consequences: fear, panic, avoidant behavior.
Rational belief: Worrying will not magically make things disappear. I will
do my best to deal with potentially distressful events and when this proves
impossible, I will accept the inevitable.
7
Irrational belief: It is easier to avoid facing many life difﬁculties and
self-responsibilities rather than to undertake more rewarding forms
of self-discipline.
Consequences: procrastination, lack of follow through, failing to achieve
goals.
Rational belief: In the long run, the easy and undisciplined way is less
rewarding than the longer-range approach to pleasure and enjoyment.
8
Irrational belief: My past remains all-important and because something
once strongly inﬂuenced my life, it has to keep determining my feelings and
behavior today.
Consequences: powerlessness, external locus of control, helplessness.
Rational belief: Continual rethinking of my old assumptions and rework-
ing of my past habits can help minimize most of the pernicious inﬂuences
from my childhood and adolescence.
9
Irrational belief: People and things should turn out better than they do and
I must view things as horrible and awful if I do not ﬁnd good solutions to
life’s grim realities.
Consequences: excessive frustration and anger, self- and other pity.
Rational belief: Whether I like it or not, reality exists and I’d better accept
its existence before I set about changing it.
10
Irrational belief: I can achieve maximum happiness by inertia and inaction
or by passively and uncommittedly “enjoying myself.”
Consequences: laziness, lack of satisfaction with life.
Rational belief: I will tend to be happiest if I get involved in long-term,
challenging work which requires the taking of risks and forces me to act
against my own inertia.
There are literally hundreds and hundreds of irrational beliefs which cause
emotional distress, many of which will be examined throughout this book.
Why We Get Unhappy
27

More recently, Ellis arrived at the insight that it was possible to describe three
general irrational beliefs that could account for most of all our irrational
thinking. These three irrational beliefs along with Ellis’ explanation as to
why they are irrational are as follows. Also provided are three, alternative
rational beliefs that Ellis labels as: USA, UOA and UAL.
Irrational belief no. 1
I must do well and win approval or else I am an inadequate, rotten person.
You set expectations for yourself and, if you do not live up to them, you see
yourself as inferior in your own eyes and in the eyes of others. Hence, you
feel that the only measure of your self-worth is the degree to which you can
perform in a certain manner. You feel that other people will condemn and
reject you if you do not do as you should, as you must. Naturally, as
humans we sometimes have a tendency either to over-evaluate our own
potential or to set goals for ourselves which people whom we respect or
admire have either achieved themselves or would like to see us achieve. In
many instances, these speciﬁc goals go beyond the realm of our capacity. It
seems rational and understandable that you may feel disappointed if you
do not reach certain achievements. Yet, I can see no real reason for you to
make yourself depressed, anxious, or angry at the realization that such
goals remain, at least presently, beyond your reach.
Rational alternative
USA (Unconditional Self-Acceptance): Accepting your self, essence,
totality whether or not you act (and perform) well and whether or not
you are approved by signiﬁcant others. Under all conditions!20
Irrational belief no. 2
Others must treat me considerately and kindly in precisely the way I want them to
treat me; if they don’t, society and the universe should severely blame, damn and
punish them for their inconsiderateness.
Often humans like to feel or delude themselves into believing that they are
the center of the universe and that all other people should, must cater to
their needs and whims. Naturally, when two or more persons interact, a
distinct possibility exists that this attitude will prevail in each of them. If
so, conﬂicts can easily arise since each person has his or her own interest as
the primary concern. Although I grant that you can appropriately extend
considerations to other people as well as yourself, this ideal attitude
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
28

unfortunately does not always arise. You may therefore wisely prepare to
cope with a world of people who may often treat you harshly and unfairly
and, in dealing with such circumstances, to seek alternatives to anger such
as those offered by the Rational-Emotive Behavior Therapy formula.
Rational alternative
UOA (Unconditional Other-Acceptance): Accepting, respecting, honor-
ing, and loving (your partner) and others even with their shortcomings
and failings. Strongly seeing and feeling the Christian idea of accepting the
sinner but not the sin. Despite all!20
Irrational belief no. 3
Conditions under which I live must be arranged so that I get practically everything
I want comfortably, quickly, and easily and get virtually nothing that I don’t want.
This may well seem the most irrational ideal of the three. We all recognize
the irrationality of demanding that the conditions of our environment
co-operate with our individual desires. Yet in my experience many people
actually do upset themselves frequently and unnecessarily when these
same forces refuse to “comply.”
Rational alternative
ULA (Unconditional Life Acceptance or High Frustration Tolerance):
Accepting life with its hassles, problems and difﬁculties, and creating
enjoymentinitforyourselfandothers.Notalways,butfairlyconsistently.20
Let me summarize what Ellis is saying about the difference between rational
and irrational beliefs. A rational belief is true (consistent with reality in kind
and degree and supported by evidence), not absolutistic (stated as a desire, hope,
want, wish, or preference), generally results in appropriate emotion (irritation not
anger,sadnessnotdepression,concernnotpanic),andhelpsyouobtainyourgoals.
An irrational belief is not true (does not follow from reality, is not supported
by evidence, and may be an overgeneralization), is a command (expressed as
a demand versus a wish), leads to disturbed emotions (extremes of anger, anxiety,
depression, guilt, jealousy), and does not help you attain your goals.
How can you give up that goddamn must, that’s the problem! You have
gratuitous problems of living that you are creating because of your
inordinate demands that you have to do well. Masturbation is good
and delicious. Musturbation is bad and pernicious. (Ellis public lecture)

The Strength of Irrational Convictions
Ellis contends that when people are emotionally upset, they tend to forcefully,
vividly, and vigorouslyholdon totheir main irrationalbeliefs. Sometimes this is
because people mistakenly believe that whatever they think about themselves
other people, or the world, must be true, because they are thinking it. That is,
they have not learned the difference between assumptions and facts.
People who are emotionally over-aroused frequently have mistaken assump-
tions that are creating most of their “upsetedness”. Some strongly opinionated
and inﬂexible people have a hard time accepting that what they believe may,
indeed,befalse.Additionally,evenwhen theyhaveinsight intowhattheirbeliefs
are, they may still strongly believe them and refuse to give them up.
In the following discussion from one of his therapy sessions, Ellis highlights
these issues with a woman who has extreme social anxiety on public transpor-
tation because she is afraid that when she gets motion sickness she will throw up.
ELLIS:
But let’s assume the worst and that you never get rid of your vomiting
and that it occurs from time to time out of the blue on trains, and that
people stare at you. Let’s suppose that happens. You throw up or they
just notice how green around the gills you are and stare at you. Now
what’s the horror of that?
JANE:
I know it’s not terrible. I know I shouldn’t care, but I do.
ELLIS:
No, don’t say you shouldn’t care. You had better care because anybody
who has any bad physical symptom would be foolish to say “I don’t
care.” But you’d better not care too much!
JANE:
I know I shouldn’t think they’re disapproving of me. They don’t care
about me, they don’t know me, they couldn’t care less. All they care
about is getting out of the way so I don’t vomit on them. It gives them
something to talk about on the train. But do you know intellectually I
can’t seem to convince myself.
ELLIS:
Now why can’t you convince yourself that that’s not shameful? Why
can’t you convince yourself, at least gradually, that even if you shit in
your pants on the train that that’s a pain in the ass, but that’s all it is?
JANE:
I don’t know. I think I know that social approval is very important to
me, OK? Approval is a very important thing. If I can go back and ﬁgure
out why I have that –
ELLIS:
No, no. We’d better get to the reason now – and not waste time
discovering how you ﬁrst got this way. Do you know why social
approval is so important to you now? The false reason is that you had
early experiences that made you need societal approval. That’s horse-
shit. Your tendency to think you must have people’s approval is largely
innate and doesn’t just stem from your past. You’re taking a standard,
wishing that other people would approve of you, which is perfectly
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
30

OK, and you’re escalating it to “I must have their approval.” That’s
your innate tendency and that’s not part of your culture. Your culture
may go along with and enhance your must; but you would tend to
create it about almost any important standard in any culture.
JANE:
OK, presuming that I’m predisposed, presuming that I’m born into it
more than I learned it.
ELLIS:
Right. Therefore, you’d better try harder to change it, by going over it
very, very vigorously a thousand times until you nearly convince
yourself, “Yes, if I vomit on them they probably won’t like me and I
don’t like that. But, tough shit! I will always have handicaps, as bright
as I am, as attractive as I am, as nice as I am. And I will always have
handicaps and there will always be people who won’t like me. And if I
have thishandicap therewilleven bemorewhowon’tlikeme –though
fortunatelymostofthemarestrangers.BecauseinthesubwayI’llnever
meet them again. But there will be people in my own life who if they
ﬁnd out I’m nauseous and can’t do certain things will put me down,
willlikemeless.Tough!Now,howcanIdealwiththishandicap?”Let’s
assumetheworst:Thatyou’llneverloseyourtendencytofeelnauseous
andtovomit.Youcanthentellyourself,“Icanﬁndpeoplewhowilllike
me, like my husband, my parents, my friends, despite the fact that I’m
handicapped. I can ﬁnd people who know exactly what my failings are,
just as I know their failings and accept them. That’s what I will do –
have a happy life but not as happy as I would otherwise have if I didn’t
have this handicap.” Now you see what you can tell yourself and you
had better go over it a thousand times!
JANE:
But just saying it to myself doesn’t seem to make a difference.
ELLIS:
No, just saying it isn’t the thing. That’s parroting. You had better
convince yourself of rational beliefs.
JANE:
But how do I convince myself?
ELLIS:
By proving to yourself that your rational views are true and effective.
Howdoyouconvinceyourselfthattheworldisroundwheneverytime
you look at it it’s ﬂat? Every time you look it’s ﬂat, and you never really
see it as round. Maybe you’ve seen pictures taken from a rocket. But
when you grew up you never saw the world as round.
JANE:
No.
ELLIS:
How do you convince yourself it’s round when you go out and always
see it ﬂat? How do you convince yourself that it’s round?
JANE:
Cause people told me and I believed them.
ELLIS:
Yes, butyoudomore thanthat. Youcheckit.There’sagroupofpeople

you could listen to them. But, there is objective evidence that it’s not
ﬂat.
JANE:
Yeah, they taught me in school. They showed you pictures of the globe
and all that kind of stuff, and so you looked at it. And then they taught
you evidence about it.
Why We Get Unhappy
31

ELLIS:
But even withoutthatyou could haveﬁgured itout.Becauseyou know
that people go around the world. You’ve never heard of a single person
who has fallen off. You see, you check your belief with the data.
JANE:
But data is different. There’s something clear-cut in that case that you
can check against. But this is not as clear-cut, in regard to people
disliking me for my handicap.
ELLIS:
No, this is clear-cut. Because what you’re worried about is not the fact
that you have this handicap but that the results would be horrible if
people observed it and despised you. Now the data is against that
hypothesis. Let’s suppose everybody in the universe knew you were
nauseous and they knew you might vomit at times. Some of them
would stay away from you especially some anxious people who might
say “I might get nauseous too! I may get nauseous too!” But what
would really happen, in terms of practical disadvantage?
JANE:
Well if it happened on a train, it would just be a very unpleasant
situation, if that happened every time I had to go on a train.
ELLIS:
What’ssounpleasant?You’dbeinpain.Andyoumightvomit,sowhat
happens then? You’re in pain and you vomit onthe train. So? But what
would really happen? You’re not really pushing it through to the end.
JANE:
Well, in my fantasy, every time I go on the train and vomit everyone
would keep staring at me.
ELLIS:
Well let’s suppose that now. And they would, if you start vomiting on
the train. Some of them will get up and move to another car because
they can’t take it, or look away because they would be embarrassed. If
the train has 100 people, ninety or so will be staring at you. Then what
will happen? You see you’re not pushing it through, you’re stopping.
JANE:
Nothing will happen.
ELLIS:
You won’t fall off; you realize you’re not going to fall off the train!
JANE:
Nothing will happen, I just won’t like it.
ELLIS:
That’s what you don’t believe. You see that’s the real evidence. But you
don’t believe it.
JANE:
Nothing action-wise will happen. Only people’s feelings will happen.
They’ll feel annoyed, or something like that.
ELLIS:
No. Actually, two different things will happen. Some people will be
exceptionally nice to you – in fact, maybe half of them. They’ll say
“Please get away from her, give her room”; help you; give you Kleenex,
etc., while the other half will run away or show disgust or something
like that.
JANE:
I know, yeah.
ELLIS:
Halfthepeopleonthattrainwon’tlikeyou.Buttheyarestrangers.Will
they even remember you? Some will remember you, at most a whole
day! They’re not going to do anything, but only think about you.
JANE:
I know that intellectually, but it still bothers me.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
32

ELLIS:
Intellectually, means lightly. You know it lightly. Now what do you
know stronger.
JANE:
In that situation?
ELLIS:
Yeah. Intellectually or lightly, you tell yourself, “Shit, I don’t know
them, I’ll never see them again.” But what’s your stronger belief about
what they’re thinking, because they’re not really going to do anything.
JANE:
About them?
ELLIS:
They’re revolted, disgusted, displeased. Let’s assume they are. What is
your interpretation of that?
JANE:
That I’m revolting.
ELLIS:
That’s right; that it’s horrible and I’m revolting. Now once in a while
you say lightly “Oh shit, so they think I’m revolting. So what?” That’s a
belief. But your majority belief, for 80 to 90 percent of the time, is: “It’s
horrible that theythinkthat way. Itmeanssomething rotten aboutme. I
can’t stand it! It’s awful!” That’s your real belief. Now, unfortunately,
you’re deluding yourself when you ask yourself thequestionI’m asking
you, and you answer “I know nothing will happen and they won’t do
anything. It doesn’t matter.” That’s a lie, because that’s your minority
belief.
JANE:
Well, as I say I understand it intellectually, but it’s not my reaction.
ELLIS:
Give up that word “intellectual” because all beliefs are intellectual.
Whoever made that up, “intellectual insight,” was wrong. People
won’t operationally deﬁne the term. Every single belief you have is
intellectual. You believe lightly and occasionally, “It doesn’t matter
thatmuch”butstrongly,mostofthetime,youbelieve,“Itdoesmattera
lot! It really does!”
JANE:
Yes.
ELLIS:
That is what you really believe. Now you’d better strongly and
vigorously, most of the time, give up and change that belief.
JANE:
But I can’t ﬁgure out how to do it.
ELLIS:
By proving to yourself the truth. That’s the irony. The truth is that
nothing will happen. They’ll just think badly of you in their heads.
JANE:
I just go around with that in my mind continually?
ELLIS:
That’s right. It’s really the same thing you prove to yourself about the
earth, and has been proven many thousands of times; that no one falls
off the edge of the earth. You remind yourself, because they don’t fall
off andthey do travel around itthat theearth doesrevolve. We do have
day and night – and you keep showing yourself that. You don’t just say
to yourself, “Well, they told me the earth was round, therefore it’s
round.”
JANE:
But how can I give up my anxiety if I never throw up, and if I never get
people to look at me?
ELLIS:
Oh, you can imagine in your head that people are seeing you throw up
and you can use rational-emotive imagery to make yourself feel sorry
Why We Get Unhappy
33

instead of horriﬁed about that. You can also do similar things, which
will make people look at you. Some of our shame-attacking exercises
involve doing things that you would consider shameful, where people
would really look askance at you. One of our shame-attacking
exercises consists of stopping people on the street and saying “I
just got out of the loony bin, what day is it?”
JANE:
(laughter) Do people do that?
ELLIS:
Yeah. And incidentally, you know what happens when most of the
time they do it? They sit down in a cafeteria and say “You know I’m
very depressed, I just got out of the mental hospital.” They get into
interesting conversations. People often reply to them, “Oh, I’ve got a
sister who just got out of Rockland State Hospital.” That’s what
happens. And if we can get you to do some of these things, but ﬁrst
really go over it vigorously and think it through, “Yes, some of them
will think about me, some will hate me, some of them will be revolted.
A few of my friends will quit me. A few of them won’t be able to take it
when they know I’m this way. Tough shit! So it’s a handicap. A
handicap is not a horror.” That’s what you’re convincing yourself that
it is awful to be handicapped. And you do it over and over again and
you never really give it up. You think you give it up when you
occasionally say lightly “Well yes, I guess it isn’t so bad.” But then
you don’t really accept that so you’d better go right back to it. You’d
better face the fact what you truly believe consistently, not lightly, but
strongly, is thatitishorrible to berejected forvomiting. Sogoover this
many times until you get to the point where if you vomited every day it
would only be a pain in the ass. Only an inconvenience. That’s all
anything is in life.
JANE:
I have a presentation today and I’m really nervous about it.
ELLIS:
What I would do if I were as nervous as you for the presentation is tell
the audience right at the beginning, “Look, I have a problem and if
anything happens, if I feel nervous any time, it’s because of this
problem, so just bear with me.” That will get rid of most of your
nervousness. Tell them that would be one of the best things to do.
REBT stresses intellectual insight, but it also shows you the difference
between intellectual and emotional insight. It teaches people how not only
to achieve a different understanding of their problem, but also how you can feel
and act differently. As indicated above, when people only have intellectual
insight, they usually believe something lightly and occasionally. But when they
have emotional insight, they usually believe something strongly and persis-
tently, and therefore, because of this they are able to feel better and behave more
appropriately. Ellis stresses that it is only through constant work and practice
both now and in the future, to think, feel, and act against their irrational beliefs
that people are likely to surrender them and make and keep themselves less
disturbed.

People Upset Themselves About Being Upset
Ellis has found that one way in which people create their own emotional
unhappiness is when they make themselves upset about the fact that they are
upset. For example, a daughter who initially is angry with her mother (internal
emotional reaction as an activating event) becomes guilty and depressed
(secondary emotional consequences) because she believes “I should never be
angry with my mother; what a horrible person I am.” A young man sits home
alone on a Friday night (activating event) and feels depressed (emotional
consequence) because he thinks “I’m hopeless because no one has called me
up.” He causes additional emotional agony for himself by becoming depressed
about his depression: “I shouldn’t be depressed! It’s horrible to be depressed!
I’m really hopeless for being so depressed.”
Another common example is an anxious person who becomes more anxious
about their anxiety by believing “I must not be anxious! It’s awful to be anxious”
(Ellis refers to this secondary anxiety as a form of discomfort anxiety). REBT
assumes that these secondary emotional upsets often exist with individuals
who have strong initial or primary emotions about some event and who have
had strong feelings for a sustained period of time.
Ascan beseen inthe followingtranscript ofpart of atherapysession,Ellisuses
REBT to deal with secondary emotional reactions ﬁrst before it goes on to deal
withprimaryemotionalproblems.Intheexamplethatfollows,Frank,a36-year-
old, married, father of two, discusses his anxieties about riding the bus.
ELLIS:
The ﬁrst question I’m going to ask you is when you’re riding on a bus
and you see your hands sweating and you notice that you’re nervous,
how do you feel about your nervousness?
FRANK:
I feel kind of nervous about the fact that I’m nervous.
ELLIS:
That’s right, you see. So that’s going to be one of the main things that
perpetuates it. So ﬁrst I’m going to try to get you over your
nervousness about your nervousness, then we’ll go back to your
original nervousness. Let’s suppose you’re sitting on abus and you’re
nervous and you see it and you get nervous about that, “A” activating
event now is you notice your nervousness and “C” consequence is
you’renervousaboutyournervousness.Whatareyoutellingyourself
at “B” your belief system, about being nervous that’s making you
nervous about your nervousness? Now seeif you can ﬁgure that out.I
already know the answer but see if you can ﬁgure it out.
FRANK:
I just feel that I am nervous but I shouldn’t be nervous.
ELLIS:
That’s right. “I see that I’m nervous asI shouldn’t be; andisn’t it awful
that I’m more nervous than I should be!” Why shouldn’t you be
nervous when you’re nervous?
FRANK:
Well, it’s not that I shouldn’t be nervous but it’s that I’m uncom-
fortable because I am nervous.
Why We Get Unhappy
35

ELLIS:
Yes, but if you were only saying “Oh shit, I’m uncomfortable and I
don’t like this discomfort and therefore I’ll work on my
nervousness,” you wouldn’t be nervous about it. You see, when
you’re anxious about your anxiety, nervous about your nervousness,
you are putting in a should. Do you see that that’s there at that time?
And do you see that that’s illegitimate, that “I shouldn’t be nervous, I
shouldn’t be nervous”? Do you see that that’s illegitimate?
FRANK:
Well I could change it to “I would rather not be nervous.”
ELLIS:
Yes, you could but you’re not saying that. You’re saying “I’d rather
not and therefore I shouldn’t be!” Now does it follow that you
shouldn’t be nervous? Does that follow that because “nervousness
is doing me in, sitting here on the bus, I shouldn’t be nervous”? Does
that follow?
FRANK:
I don’t quite know how to answer that.
ELLIS:
Well you do know. Think about it. Suppose a friend of yours – your
own age and station – was nervous on the bus, and he’s saying “I
shouldn’t be nervous, I shouldn’t be nervous,” and making himself
more nervous. Does it follow that he must not be nervous when he’s
nervous?
FRANK:
No.
ELLIS:
Why doesn’t it follow?
FRANK:
There’s no law says he can’t be nervous.
ELLIS:
That’s right! If there were a law that said “Thou must not be nervous”
and the universe was that way, he couldn’t be nervous, you see. So it
can’t follow. Now what could you change that “I shouldn’t be
nervous” to? You could tell yourself something sensible that would
get rid of your nervousness about the nervousness. Do you know
what that would be?
FRANK:
I could tell myself I should be relaxed.
ELLIS:
Now you’ve still got the should: “I should be relaxed. I should be
relaxed,Ishouldberelaxed.”Thenyou’dbeunrelaxed.Yousee,now?
What else could you say? Try again.
FRANK:
I could say I should think about something else.
ELLIS:
Not should. You see as long as you put in that should you’re always
dead. “I should think of something else! Oh, my god, what if I don’t
think of something else! I’ll kill myself if I don’t think of something
else!” You see? It’s always the same. Why not say “I’d better think of
something else,” but even that’s inelegant. Do you know why it’s
inelegant to think of something else? You’ll be calmer if you think of
something else but why is that inelegant?
FRANK:
It’s not solving my original problem.
ELLIS:
Well it’s not solving your should. You’re just sidetracking yourself
from it and later on you’ll go right back to “I shouldn’t be nervous, I
shouldn’t be nervous!” So temporarily you could think of all kinds of
things. You could relax, do Jacobson’s relaxation technique, you
could meditate right on the bus. You could use lots of distracting
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
36

techniques, think of something pleasant. They all will work but they
don’t get rid of your anxiety-producing philosophy. To change the
philosophy, “I shouldn’t be nervous,” ask yourself “Why shouldn’t I
be nervous?” And answer, “There’s no goddamn reason! It’s unfor-
tunate that I’m nervous. So it’s unfortunate. Well, it’s not the end of
the world. Too damned bad!” You see? Now let’s return to your
original nervousness. At “A” you’re sitting in the bus and you’re with
people in the bus. If you were the only person in the bus would you
then be nervous, do you think?
FRANK:
No.
ELLIS:
No. So you’re with people and they’re looking at you; or maybe
they aren’t. They may be minding their own business. They may
be nervous about you looking at them. We don’t know what
they’re doing but let’s assume they’re looking at you. Then at “C”
you’re nervous. Because what are you telling yourself about their
looking at you or observing you? What are you saying at “B” to
yourself?
FRANK:
I’m probably saying to myself that I look funny to them.
ELLIS:
“And if I look funny to them?” And that’s possible, assuming they’re
not deaf, dumb, and blind. That means what?
FRANK:
It doesn’t really mean anything.
ELLIS:
Well, but what are you saying to yourself when you’re nervous?
You’reright,thesearestrangers,youmayneverseethemagain.Andif
they say “Oh shit, he’s a funny looking guy” how many years do you
think they will remember you?
FRANK:
(laughter) Well, if I was really funny . . .
ELLIS:
Yes but let’s suppose you’re really funny. Even then what are they
going to do, dream about you for the rest of their lives?
FRANK:
(laughter)
ELLIS:
You see that’s a little unlikely. But let’s suppose they’re saying “He’s a
really funny looking guy.” Now that isn’t making you anxious. What
are you saying about that that is making you anxious? What do you
think you’re saying to yourself? Let’s assume one of them is even
whispering to the one next to her: “Oh, he’s a funny looking guy.”
Now what are you saying to make you anxious?
FRANK:
I’m probably just feeling that they’re thinking that I’m funny
looking.
ELLIS:
And if they’re thinking it, what are you saying to yourself? Let’s
suppose they’re thinking it. You’re a mind reader and you see them
thinking it. Now what are you saying about that? You could say “So
they think I’m funny looking.” In our shame-attacking exercise we
deliberately get people to do “shameful” acts. One guy put a leather
band around his head and a big feather in it and went around all
week with his face painted like an Indian. And people did think he
was funny but he didn’t feel ashamed. And you know why he didn’t
Why We Get Unhappy
37

feel ashamed, because people were really looking at him. What do
you think he was telling himself to not feel ashamed?
FRANK:
He was telling himself that he was acting out of the ordinary so that
people would look at him.
ELLIS:
Hewassaying“TheyarelookingatmeandtheythinkI’mfunny.”But
what was he saying in addition to that that made him not feel
ashamed? What do you think he was concluding?
FRANK:
It wasn’t bothering him.
ELLIS:
“Too bad. Let em look. I don’t know these people. They’re not going
to kill me or jail me or anything like that. Let em look! That’s the way
they think, that I look funny, and as a matter of fact I do.” But you’re
saying “They’re looking at me” and then what are you saying to make
yourself anxious . . . “If they’re really thinking I’m funny,” what?
What’s your conclusion?
FRANK:
That’s the part I never get to.
ELLIS:
Well, isn’t the answer, “They’re right, I am funny looking”? Aren’t
you agreeing with them when you feel nervous? Not right now, but
when you feel nervous, aren’t you agreeing with them, “I think
they’re right. I do look funny.” Aren’t you agreeing?
FRANK:
I guess so.
ELLIS:
And what are you saying if you do look funny? What are you saying
about yourself? “That makes me what if I look funny and they think
I’m funny?”
FRANK:
That makes me nervous.
ELLIS:
No, that doesn’t make you nervous. You do it to yourself. Aren’t you
saying“Andthatmakesmeafunnypersonorasillypersonwhenthey
think I am” – something like that? Aren’t you putting yourself down
when you’re nervous?
FRANK:
Yes, I’m feeling that I’m an inferior person.
ELLIS:
That’s right. Now how do you become inferior as a person if they
think you look funny? How does that make you an inferior person?
Let’s suppose they do. They look at you and they say “Oh shit, he
looksfunny.”Nowhowdoesthatmakeyouaninferiorperson?How?
Prove it to me, I’m a scientist. I want evidence that you are an inferior
person if they think you look funny. Some of the people in the bus
really think you look funny. How does that make you inferior?
FRANK:
I don’t know.
ELLIS:
Well, think. Suppose you had a friend and he’s sitting in the bus with
you and they’re looking athim and they think he’saninferior person.
Is he really because they don’t like his looks?
FRANK:
No.
ELLIS:
Why isn’t he? Why is he not, because you’re right, he isn’t. But what
makes him not an inferior person when they don’t like his looks?
FRANK:
It’s not your looks that determine whether you’re inferior.
ELLIS:
Right.Hehasathousandtraitsandoneofthemishislooksandevenif
everyone in the world agreed that he was inferior in looks, that
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
38

wouldn’t make him an inferior person. It would make him a person
who people agree is inferior in looks. So even if they were thinking
this – which I don’t think they are, incidentally, because I don’t think
they’re bothering to look at you that closely or they think that you
look badly. But if they were, you’d better accept the fact that, “At
worst I’mapersonwholooksinferior tocertainpeople butthatnever
makes one no good.”
Cathy, a 33-year-old professional woman, married, gets anxious about her
anxiety and depressed about her depression. In the following session, Ellis
encourages her to accept herself with her secondary feelings of anxiety and
depression, and, at the same time, rather than accepting these feelings simply
because they exist, work hard to overcome the irrational ideas which create the
feelings.
CATHY:
I think also the kind of background I’ve had really encouraged me to
believe that when something went awry, situational problems, they
were my fault.
ELLIS:
Yes, but that again is an anti-empirical view that is not in itself
upsetting. Because, you see, you could say wrongly “If something
went awry it must be my fault.” Because people may have taught you
that and you may have agreed with it but when you feel upset you’re
adding “And I shouldn’t have a fault.” You see,if you said “Yes it’smy
fault, so tough shit, so I have a fault,” you wouldn’t be upset. Your
belief is that “I must not have that fault. I must not be responsible for
that failing because if I am then I’m not the noble person that I must
be.” So if we could only help you see that it’s unfortunate that you
have a fault but there’s no reason why you must not, then you
wouldn’t feel anxious. Now, when you are anxious, how do you feel
about your anxiety?
CATHY:
When I’m really anxious I think I’m a nut for being a nut. That’s one
of my problems.
ELLIS:
That’s right. Because when you’re anxious, what are you telling
yourself? “I am anxious,” that’s an observation. What’s “B”? What’s
your belief about being anxious?
CATHY:
When I get really scared and, you know, my heart and stomach and
everything show.I’m reallyscared. I think tomyself “ObviouslyI’m a
shit because if I weren’t a shit I’d be more successful.” The trouble,
when it really gets to that level, depression – you know, the depres-
sion is depressing – I get –
ELLIS:
No, it’s not. Wait a minute! Depression is not depressing. What are
you telling yourself about being depressed?
CATHY:
I shouldn’t be depressed! Look at what I’ve got, I should look at the
good things. But sometimes, when I’m feeling low I don’t feel like
raising myself up, actually, sometimes when I’m feeling low I think
“OK, so I feel low, so what?”
Why We Get Unhappy

ELLIS:
All right. But you have two different views there. One is “I feel
depressed, so that’s too bad. But even though I’m depressed right
now, it’s OK. Or I’m OK with my depression. That’s not so bad.” At
other times, you’re saying “I shouldn’t be depressed, I must not be
depressed.” Then how are you going to feel?
CATHY:
Depressed and immobilized.
ELLIS:
That’s right – depressed about your depression. Two, three, four
times as depressed. Now the point is to ﬁrst work on that
secondary symptom, depression about your depression. That is
what we do ﬁrst in RET.
CATHY:
Right.
ELLIS:
When you’re depressed about your depression then you can ask
yourself, “Why must I not be depressed?” What is the answer to that?
Why must you not be depressed?
CATHY:
Because I am, I mean, I am depressed.
ELLIS:
Yes, “there is no reason why I must not be depressed because I am.
Too bad! Tough shit, so I’m depressed!” But after saying that to
yourself and accepting yourself with your depression, you go back to
the original depression. Something went wrong at “A” – you didn’t
sell enough stuff or place enough people, or something like that. And
at “B” again you’re saying “I should have done better, I should have
done better,” and at “E” you’re depressed. And what can you do
about that “I should have done better?”
CATHY:
I don’t know, I guess it’s just accept the fact that I didn’t do better.
ELLIS:
Yes, accept it without liking it. “It’s too fucking bad! So I didn’t do
better. Tough!” Don’t tell yourself, “It’s good that I didn’t do better.”
Or “I don’t care that I didn’t do better.”
CATHY:
I do care. I wouldn’t say that.
ELLIS:
Yes,“It’stoobadIdidn’tdobetter.LetmeseewhatIdidbadlyifIdid.

ELLIS:

get rid of your anxiety about your anxiety: “Isn’t it terrible that I’m
anxious, suppose they see that I’m anxious!” You can change that
too! “Well, that’s too bad that I’m anxious. That is wrong, that is self-
defeating, but that’s all that it is. I can live with it.” Then back to the
original anxiety, which is, again: “I must be perfect! I must win their
approval!” There is no reason why you have to be perfect or win their
approval, even though it’s desirable.

Refusing to Become Desperately
Unhappy
If you stayed with wishes, you could stubbornly refuse to become
needlessly anxious, depressed, enraged or self-pitying about virtually
anything that happened. You would still have the problems of ﬁnding
positive pleasures and joys to make yourself truly happy; but you would be
one of the rare people on early who was practically never self-ﬂagellatingly
miserable.17
Ellis argues that as a general rule, a prerequisite insight for people wishing to
reduce their unhappiness is recognizing the fallacy of the commonly held idea
that“Emotional miserycomes from external pressuresand youhavelittle ability
to control or change your feelings.” Ellis’ worldview on the origins of emotional
upset has remained consistent over 60 years; namely, people mainly create their
own emotional upsets and can change them by thinking more rationally.
The Development of REBT
The earliest beginnings of REBT can be traced to Ellis’ personal life in the 1920s
and 1930s where he began to cope with his own severe problems, including
shyness about meeting females and public speaking anxiety. Over these and
subsequent years Ellis spent a great deal of time reading books and articles by
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness: The Legacy of Albert Ellis
 Michael E. Bernard

leading philosophers (Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Baruch Spinoza, John
Dewey, Bertrand Russell, A.J. Ayer, Hans Reichenbach, Karl Popper) and
psychologists (Alfred Adler, E. Coue, A. Herzberg, W. Johnson, Karen
Horney) as he became increasingly interested in the philosophy of happiness.
Ellis was trained in classical psychoanalysis and psychoanalytically oriented
psychotherapy by a training analyst of the Karen Horney Institute in New York
in the late 1940s and commenced work in sex, love, marriage, and family
problems in the 1940s.
The early 1950s was a period when Ellis became increasingly disenchanted
with the main type of therapy available at that time – and the one he was trained
in – psychoanalysis. From his own practice he began to see that he could help
people get better sooner by being more active and directive in his methods.
Speciﬁcally,hebegantointerprettheproblemsofpeopleintermsofirrational
thinking and the faulty ways people conceptualized and evaluated their world
rather than in terms of intra-psychic conﬂicts unresolved complexes, and other
early childhood inﬂuences characteristic of the psychoanalytic theory of mal-
adjustment. In fact, Ellis vainly tried to reformulate psychoanalysis in scientiﬁc
terms but abandoned his attempts in 1953, concluding it was inefﬁcient, non-
effective, and frequently does more harm than good.
I developed REBT after believing wrongly in psychoanalytic philosophies,
mainly Freudian, but I found out they didn’t work. Freud wasa genius, but
sobiased that hehad little understanding really of what emotional illness is
and where it comes from. Following him, most psychiatrists and psychol-
ogists have even less understanding of the main causes and core of
disturbance.
Psychoanalysis is in many ways really nauseating. It’s nauseating
because when people read it a hundred years from now they’re going
to vomit that professionals gave it any credence because it’s often a
paranoid system, which invents early “causes” for neurosis. Freudian
answers are almost all false or misleading. They contain utter horseshit.
Freudians start with devout theories that they can force into the
Procrustean bed of their theories. Like paranoids, they always ﬁnd these
roots. They provide so many contradictory possibilities that they can
never fail to “substantiate” their conjectures. Freud used the term
“science” continually, but as Karl Popper and other philosophers have
indicated Freudianism is an anti-scientiﬁc cult.
Freud said that your mother made you crazy because she raised you
badly and therefore you are depressed and anxious. That’s utter crap. Your
mother and father gave you standards but you largely created your
irrational musts about these standards. Upbringing and environment
contribute to but do not directly cause your emotional problems. You
bother yourself about your environment, about your father and mother
and brothers and sisters. (Ellis public lecture)
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
42

Ellis rejects Freud’s theory concerning the role of early childhood experiences
in later adjustment and is equally rejecting of the need to spend a substantial
amount of time in therapy analyzing these experiences. According to Ellis,
people act for better or worse because of their current, and fairly conscious,
thinking and attitudes about their world and not because of their repressed
feelings concerning their parents.
Ellis actively disputes the belief promulgated by psychoanalytic theorists that
“It is the past and all its bad experiences which continually ruin the present and
which can never really be overcome.” He forcefully argues, instead, that people
can overcome the effects of past experience by reassessing their perceptions of
the past, and re-evaluating their interpretations of its inﬂuence.
The solution to the problem of emotional unhappiness lies in helping people
to recognize, understand, and to work hard and practice changing their
irrational thinking which causes them to become overly upset about their
own imperfections, other peoples’ behavior, and general conditions which
exist in their lives.
But I’m not joking when I say you can get rid of any emotional hang-up,
any real upsetness, any depression, anxiety, despair, suicidalness, hostility,
or real low frustration tolerance, gooﬁng, feelings of inadequacy, and
actual avoiding of things, in no more than 5 to 10 minutes if you work at it.
And I’m going to show you how to work at it and then you will or won’t
work at it – and of course if you don’t then you’re really acting crazily –
and that’s your problem that you won’t work at getting better. But if you’re
pretty crazy then you’re in very good company, because the human race as
a whole is really out of its goddamn head. Now all of you, of course, know
this about others – about your mother and father and sister and brothers
and friends and wives and husbands. You know how nutty they are. Now
the problem is to get you to admit this about yourself and then to do
something about it – which you very quickly can if you use REBT. And if
you use it enough times and really work at it, it becomes easier and
habitual. Eventually, you automatically don’t upset yourself about prac-
tically anything in the entire universe, no matter how obnoxious it is. You
feel very sorry and displeased about it – but not panicked nor depressed.
(Ellis public lecture)
Until the early 1960s, Ellis called his unique form of therapyRational Therapy
because he wanted to emphasize its philosophic and thinking aspects. Rational
Therapy was then re-named Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) to emphasize the
interconnectedness between rationality and emotional functioning. Finally, in
the 1970s, his therapy was renamed, again, by Ellis into Rational Emotive
Behavior Therapy (REBT). He wished to emphasize not only its use of
behavioral methods to help challenge and change irrational beliefs, but also,
to alert people to Ellis’ long-standing conviction that his form of therapy not
Refusing to Become Desperately Unhappy
43

only was directed at helping people feel better, but also to get better with an
emphasis on positive changes in behavior.
Rational Therapy and Rational Emotive therapy profoundly shook the
therapeutic community. For not only did Ellis reject notions of the unconscious
and the importance of analyzing early childhood experiences – the foundations
of psychoanalytically oriented therapy – but his form of therapy was also unlike
classical psychoanalysis and Rogerian client-centered therapy by being highly
confronting. Rather than relying on genuineness, on modeling unconditional
positive regard, on empathy, and on other indirect and inactive methods of
change, rational-emotive practitioners were ready to point out and help correct
the irrational assumptions, ideas, and beliefs which were seen to be at the core of
a problem.
People welcomed rational therapists’ active involvement and, in particular,
beingprovidedwithaframeworkwhichwaseasytounderstandinashortperiod
of time and which gave the major onus and responsibility for change to them
rather than their counselor or therapist.
I experimented with other techniques which were non-Freudian and kept
the ones that seemed to work best and which happened to be more
philosophic than psychodynamic. They seemed to work. Had they not
worked then, even though I might have liked them, I wouldn’t have kept
them. You could say I have a gene for efﬁciency. My goal in about
everything that I do is to be efﬁcient. You have only one life and it has a
limited length of time. Time is of the essence, therefore, I try not to do
inefﬁcient things. Of course I do, for I’m not infallible. But my belief is that
the goal of psychotherapy is not only to help people but to help them as
quickly, effectively, intelligently, and elegantly as possible. Therefore, I
wouldn’t tolerate the Freudian practice, which is very inefﬁcient. (Ellis
public lecture)
Albert Ellis’ therapy of REBT is best known for its ABC model of irrational
thinking and emotional problems, alternatively denoted by the initials, ABC-
DE. The essential aspects of this model are illustrated in the accompanying
diagram “Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy’s A-B-C Theory of Emotional
Disturbance” (in Bernard and Wolfe’s The REBT Resource Book for Practitioners
(2000).
The ABCs of REBT
Using Ellis’ easy to remember ABC alphabetical system, according to Ellis,
people’s feelings and behaviors are consequences (Cs) of their beliefs (Bs) about
some activating or adverse event (A). Although activating events (As) often
seem to directly cause or contribute to emotional and behavioral consequences
(Cs), this is rarely the case, since between an activating or adverse event (A) and
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
44

Refusing to Become Desperately Unhappy
45

emotional and behavioral consequences (C) are their beliefs about the event.
Ellis holds that people largely bring their beliefs to situations and subjectively
and idiosyncratically view or experience events in light of their beliefs, expecta-
tions, and evaluations. They rarely experience events in their lives without ﬁrst
thinking about and evaluating the event. They also rarely experience feelings
without some activating event in mind.
In the following transcript of a public lecture, Ellis indicates the important
role of thinking and beliefs in people’s emotional problems.
As usual, I’m going to teach you the ABCs of REBT. And it is as simple as
ABC. Unfortunately, simple doesn’t mean easy, because all of you know
exactly how to diet and how not to smoke but that doesn’t mean you all
diet and don’t smoke. It’s simple to know what to do but not necessarily to
do it.But unfortunately, most ofyou don’t know how tocure yourselves of
your emotional problems and you’re not only natural goofers but you
don’t know how not to goof so you have a double problem there. But I’m
going to show you how to get rid of these problems. Then getting rid of
them is your effort, fortunately, not mine! We’ll see how many of you
accept the challenge. The following diagram depicts my ABC model.
In the ABCs of REBT, we usually start with “C.” “C” is a consequence – an
emotional consequence such as rage, depression, or anxiety, which we
frequently call an emotional disturbance, a symptom. It can also be a
psychosomaticreaction, likehigh blood pressure orulcers.“C” canalso stand
forabehavioralconsequence–somethingyoudoordon’tdo,suchasinactivity,
running away from certain things, a compulsion, or lack of discipline.
Now let’s assume that at “C” you’re enraged, you’re really furious. At “A,”
the activating event or activating experience, somebody has done you in:
somebody has promised you everything and given you much less.
Andconsequentlyyoufeelenraged.Andlet’ssupposethattheinjusticeactually

practicallyeverybodyexceptRational-EmotiveBehaviortherapists(whoarea

causes“C”: “He or shedid mein, acted unfairlyandunjustly at A, and I now

disturbedbecausetheyaregoingtotellyouit’sgoodtobeenraged.They’llget
youtopoundapillow,toassumethatthepillowisthepersonwhoharmedyou
and to beat it (representing him) over the head.
Beating the pillow,you may ﬁnally exhaust yourself so much thatyou can’t
be enraged any more. You may not feel angry anymore at that moment.
However, as many psychological experiments show, every time you beat the
pillow you may well become angrier, and ﬁnally go out and literally kick your
opponent in the teeth. That frequently occurs, since while you are beating the
pillow you can easily repeat to yourself, “That bastard should not have done
what he did! He deserves to die!”
Anyway, if you came to see me for therapy I would help you rationally to
tell yourself “Well, I know I’m enraged and I know I’m responsible for my
disordered feeling. I’m not going to cop out and blame him for my feeling.
And I’m not going to blame my sacred mother, who 20 years ago looked at
me cross-eyed and did me in, so that now I’m presumably transferring my
rage from her to him. I’m going to assume full responsibility and admit, I
did it with my little hatchet, I caused my own rage. Now what can I do to get
rid of it?”
So I say to you “Well look at B – your Belief System.” Andyousay,“Well
all right, let’s look at B. Shall we fart around for the next ﬁve years like that
analyst I went to, to ﬁnd out what B is about?” And I say, “No, I know it.”
And you say “Well, how do you do it? You didn’t ask me any questions
about my early childhood. You got very little about A out of me. And
you’renotgoingaroundgettingmetotalkaboutmyfeelings,mychildhood.
You got very little about A out of me. And you’re not going around getting
me to talk about my feelings, my feelings, my feelings. Now, how do you
know B?” And I reply, “I’m efﬁcient. I’ve got a good therapy system. If you
went to an analyst, she’d know B too, but she’d be wrong. She’d tell you
that B is your Oedipus complex, and that you’re really afraid of getting
your penis cut off. And that’s why you’re enraged at your opponent. Or
some horseshit like that. So she’d know right away, but take about ﬁve years
to let you in on it. But don’t forget: she’s got to make a living, the poor
analyst. And if I were a supportive, Rogerian therapist, I’d be nice to you,
nice to you, nice to you. And you’d sort of vaguely ﬁnd out, maybe, what B
is – that you don’t have unconditional positive regard for yourself. But you
wouldn’tbeveryclearaboutitordiscoverhowtofullyacceptyourself.Being
peculiar, I know what B is and I’m going to tell you. I’m going to tellyou so
that in a few minutes you can go home and work on it.”

So I’ll show you right away what “B” is. (Ellis public lecture)
A central element to the ABCs of REBT is the discovery by people of the
irrational beliefs that create their emotional miseries as well as the rational beliefs
that make them sane. A fundamental assumption of Ellis is that when people
seriously upset themselves, they almost always accept or invent strong abso-
lutistic, musturbating irrational beliefs. Insofar as this is the case, Ellis directs
his questioning about people’s beliefs, about adverse events with a focus on
pinpointing their absolutes, shoulds, oughts and musts. Ellis advises: “Cherchez le
should (Look for the should). Cherchez le must (Look for the must).” REBT
methods also are directed at identifying as “Bs” those patterns of thinking that
involve people awfulizing about adversity, have I-can’t-stand-it-itis about frus-
trating and adverse conditions in the world including people’s behavior and their
tendency to engage in global rating of themselves, others, and the world.
In the transcript of a therapy session that follows, Ellis illustrates the rational
and irrational beliefs associated with being angry with someone who has done
the wrong thing.
If you ﬁgured it out you can easily see that “B” consists of two major
beliefs. First, you have a rational, sensible, empirically founded belief; and,
second, an irrational, nutty belief. Now the rational one is obvious and
almost everyone will have this belief when somebody treats them unfairly,
obnoxiously, badly, as you feel you have been treated. They’ll say to
themselves (and maybe to others as well), “Isn’t that a pain in the ass! I
don’t like his behavior. I wish hewouldn’t treat me that way. Now what the
devil can I do to get him to stop it?” Now that’s a fairly rational belief.
Someone, we’re assuming, has behaved obnoxiously. You do value
aliveness, and you do value happiness. And freedom from needless
pain. So to say to yourself, “He did me in and I don’t like it. I wish it
weren’t so. How annoying!” is very sane. If you stuck to those sane beliefs,
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
48

which you often won’t because you’re basically human and somewhat
nutty, as all humans are, you would then feel sorry, regretful, frustrated,
annoyed, and irritated.
And if it were very important that you be dealt with justly – let’s suppose
it was a matter of losing your job and you unfairly lost it – you would be
very sorry, very disappointed, very irritated, very annoyed. And that’s
good, even though those are negative emotions, because they force you
back to the activating event, “A,” to try to change it – to try to get more
justice; to try to change the behavior of this individual or to avoid him in
the future. If you’re not emotional, you’re not motivated to do very much.
Butweknowthatthistimeyouactuallyfeelenraged.You’refurious,you’re
homicidal.Youmaywellgoaroundforthenext40yearshatingthisguy’sguts
andplottingandschemingtodohimin.Soweknowthatthat’syourfeeling–
anger, resentment, and fury, rage. Okay, where did that feeling come from?
It almost always comes from a nutty should, an absolute, an ought, a must.
And the four things, the four irrational forms of this belief which you are
usuallysayingtoyourselfandyoumightbesayingthemtoothers,butmainly
to yourself, about his obnoxious, unfair unjust behavior are:
1
“He absolutely shouldn’t have acted that way!”
2
“It’s awful that he acted that way, unjustly, as he should not.”
3
“I can’t stand his horrible behavior – which he must not exhibit.”
4
“Because he did what he should not, must not have done, he is a louse,
he is a turd! I hope he drops dead!”
Well, those are all very crazy beliefs.
Obviously if you say something like that to yourself you’ll immedi-
ately feel enraged and very upset. If you have those beliefs about him and
his behavior you’ll feel furious at him, and you caused your rage by those
beliefs. Every one of your irrational beliefs is magic, is nonsense is against
reality, is unveriﬁable. Why? Well, think about them and you’ll see. But if
you hesitate to think about them I’ll urge you to. “A” – the activating
event – he treated you unfairly. “B” – your irrational beliefs – “He should
not have done that to me.” “It’s awful.” “I can’t stand it.” “He’s a louse
for acting lousily.” Then, “C” your feelings of anger and hostility. (Ellis
public lecture)
In the following case study, Ellis helps his clients to zero in on the irrational
belief of demandingness that are central to Mary’s depression.
ELLIS:
OK Mary, what problem would you like to start with?
MARY:
I compare myself to people constantly.
ELLIS:
Give us a recent example where you were comparing yourself with
other people.
MARY:
If I’m in a classroom and I see somebody knows more than I do, I feel
bad.
Refusing to Become Desperately Unhappy

ELLIS:
So you putyourself down. Now atpoint “A” in REBT, somebody does
better than you in class and at point “C” you put yourself down, you
feelanxiousordepressed.OK,nowwhatdoyouthink“B”is?There’sa
“B” that you’re telling yourself, which I already have guessed. Let’s see
if you can ﬁgure it out.
MARY:
I believe that I’m not meeting my own requirement standards. I feel
that I wish I could do better.
ELLIS:
All right. But that’s the rational view and that wouldn’t get you into
trouble.“IknowwhatmystandardsareandI’mnotmeetingthemand
I wish I would do better.” That’s very rational because we don’t want
you to give up that wish, there’s no reason you should not want to do
better. If you stayed only with that statement “I wish I would do better
but I’m not, I’m not achieving my standards,” you wouldn’t be self-
downing. Do you know why you wouldn’t?
MARY:
No.
ELLIS:
Because you would be downing your behavior, you’re not coming up
to your standards. But you would have to add something else to down
you. For you wouldn’t feel so rotten if you said “I wish that I would do
better but I’m not.” For the implied end of your sentence would be
“And someday maybe I will do better and even if I never do better,
that’s unfortunate, that’s too bad.” A wish will never get you into
serious emotional trouble. Do you see that that’s so? Now you’ve got
something stronger than a wish, you have a demand or a command in
there that leads to your self-downing. What do you think that is?
MARY:
Well, that I feel frustrated that I’m not doing better. So sometimes I’m
negative about getting better at a time later in the future.
ELLIS:
That’s right. “I must do better right now because if I don’t do better
right now I’ll probably never do better. And that would be terrible and
what a worm I would be!” Right?
MARY:
Right.
ELLIS:
Let’sdispute that.Whymustyoudobetter?Not“whyisitpreferable to
do better,” but why must you do better?
MARY:
Because it would make me feel better.
ELLIS:
That’s circular thinking. Do you realize why that’s circular thinking?
MARY:
No.
ELLIS:
Well anything will make you feel better when you say “I must have it”
and you have it. Suppose Hitler said “I must kill another six million
Jews and Gypsies” and he did. He would feel ﬁne because he had
achieved what he told himself he must do. Right? But does he really
have to kill another six million Jews and Gypsies?
MARY:
No.
ELLIS:
So the fact that you feel better just means that you achieved your must.
But I’m still asking the question which you haven’t answered. Even
though you’d feel better if you did it why must you do it and why must
you feel better?

MARY:
I don’t have to but I want to.
ELLIS:
Ah,“Idon’t haveto butIwantto –and Ireallyshould.” Yousee,you’re
sneaking that in and that’s what you do much of the time. But if you
really stopped with “I don’t have to and I only want to,” would you be
upset when you didn’t do well and when other people did better?
MARY:
No.
ELLIS:
No. You’re saying “I don’t have to,” but you’re unconsciously adding,
“I should! And if they do better than I do, as I should have done, then
there’ssomethingwrongwith me.”So theﬁrstthing you’dbetterdois
go over that hundreds of times. “I never have to do better, I only want
to. And if I don’t do as I want to do, to do better, too bad!” Then you’ll
feel sorry, disappointed, regretful, and frustrated which is OK.
Because if you lost your frustration and you lost your disappointment
at not doing well, you wouldn’t have any incentive to do better. We’re
not trying to get rid of your feelings, just your anxiety, and your
damnationofyourself,whichcomesfromyourmusts.Nowletmejust
get to the other beliefs, which go with your musts. Let’s suppose you
never did better, you were always below your standards – and you
never do better, you try but you never do better. Why would that be
awful if that occurred? If you were always below your standards, why
would that be terrible?
MARY:
It wouldbeterrible because I’mexpectingtodobetterandI’dfeelvery
bad about myself, I’d feel mediocre if I didn’t.
ELLIS:
Yousee, you gavetherightanswer. It wouldbe terriblebecause ofyour
nuttyexpectations.ButIwantmoreevidencethanthat.You’remaking
a statement “It is terrible when I don’t do well enough” and I want
evidence of the terribleness, not for the undesirability. What makes it
terrible other than your statement that “I must do well?” Is there
anything else that makes it terrible?
MARY:
Feeling bad.
ELLIS:
Well,thatmakesitbad.That’sright.Youwillfeelbadifyou dopoorly,
belowyourstandard.Butwhatmakesthatbadnessterrible?Itisbad,so
let’s not deny it. But why is it terrible in addition to being bad?
MARY:
I don’t know. What you say is very logical but it just doesn’t feel that
way.
ELLIS:
Well, it doesn’t feel that way because what you think is illogical. Let’s
suppose there’s a woman you know, your age, your education, your
social station and background and that she doesn’t do as well as she
could, she achieves below her own standards. Do you really think it’s
awful, terrible, and horrible when she does badly?
MARY:
Oh, no.
ELLIS:
Oh, no! Now why is that? Why do you think that is? You’re willing to
accept her, you wouldn’t damn her, but you’re not willing to accept
you and you condemn you. What’s the difference between you and
her?

MARY:
Well, I don’t care as much for her as I care about myself.
ELLIS:
Unfortunately you don’t care much about yourself! You see, you’re
linking your self with your behavior. Now if you really cared about
yourselfyou’ddropthatlink.You’resayingtoyourself,“Yes,letherbeas
bad as she is, she doesn’t have to be better. But I must be special.” Why
must you be special?
MARY:
I don’t know.
ELLIS:
Well, I think she doesn’t have to be special. Suppose she said to me “I
have to be special and Mary can go and fail as much as she wants.”
Would she be right that she has to be special?
MARY:
No.
ELLIS:
That’s right. Why is that wrong that she has to be special?
MARY:
Because we don’t have to be special, I know that.
ELLIS:
That’s right. And when we think we have to be special and we don’t do
well how do we feel?
MARY:
Bad.
ELLIS:
When we don’t achieve well, we naturally feel badly. We feel sorry, we
feel dreadful. But it’s this specialness that makes people upset – their
demanding, “I have to do well and I have to be special above others in
order to accept myself.” Isn’t that crazy? You refuse to accept yourself
unless you do well and are special. And how will that help you do
better? When you have that attitude, you get down and feel anxious.
Will that make you do better in class?
MARY:
No.
ELLIS:
Will it make you do worse?
MARY:
Sometimes.
ELLIS:
That’s right. Very often! Because you’ll be so anxious, “Oh, my God! I
must do better! I must be special! I must be special.” How will you have
time and energy to study and listen when you worry like that? You see,

One of the unique and powerful REBT methods for helping people to reduce
or remove their emotional upsets is to show them how to actively challenge or
dispute (D) their irrational beliefs and to help change them to new effective (E)
rational beliefs which will enable them to think more rationally, behave more
constructively and to live a happier and more fulﬁlled life.
Disputing Methods and New Rational Effects
Disputation is a rather formidable sounding word but it simply refers to
different methods which demonstrate to people the irrationality of their
thinking and which helps them acquire a more rational, non-absolutistic
view of yourself, others, and the world.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
52

It is frequently difﬁcult for people to detect their own or another’s irration-
ality. There are a number of reasons for this. First, they are not used to thinking
about their own beliefs. Second, much of their thinking is automatic; they do it
without much effort or insight and, therefore, they are often unaware of the fact
that they are thinking at all. Third, while it is relatively easier for people to
become aware of the rational ways in which they view life, some of their
irrational beliefs are often subconscious. That is, they exist but are hidden away
from immediate consciousness. It may well be that people push their irrational
beliefs partially out of their awareness because the messages they contain are
threatening and emotionally upsetting (e.g., “I’m hopeless because my mother
ignored me”). Alternatively, some irrational beliefs appear to be holdovers from
childhooddayswhen bynaturepeople thoughtirrationallyortooktooseriously
the irrational messages to which they were subjected and which they have never
since re-examined for logic or rationality.
REBT provides methods for people to use with and without the support of
a counselor or therapist that helps them to examine their own beliefs in order
to ensure that their belief system is based on sound thinking and accurate
knowledge and is working in their best interests.
The three main REBT methods of disputing irrationality are now presented.
Disputing methods that focus on changing thinking
The main disputation method for changing irrational thinking involves helping
people examine their own thinking when they are extremely and inappropri-
ately upset (depressed rather than sad, highly anxious and panicked rather than
concerned, very angry and raging rather than annoyed and irritated).
Sometimes called philosophical disputation or cognitive disputation, this
method can be divided into three parts: (1) detecting irrational beliefs and
seeing how they are illogical, unrealistic and unscientiﬁc; (2) debating irrational
beliefs and showing yourself how and why they do not hold water; and (3)
discriminating irrational from rational beliefs and changing the former so that
you get healthier results. This type of disputation is similar to the scientiﬁc
methods employed in experimental investigations. A hypothesis (belief) is
formulated and the scientist gathers data that will be the evidence to accept
or reject the hypothesis.
There are three questions that Ellis routinely uses with his clients (and people
can independently employ with themselves) to determine whether a particular
way of thinking (self-talk) is irrational or rational.
Is what I am thinking sensible and logical (e.g., “Does it follow that because I like
to be liked, I need to be liked?”)?
Is what I am thinking true (“Where is the evidence?”)?
Is what I am thinking helping me to achieve my goals?
Refusing to Become Desperately Unhappy
53

Here’s how Ellis illustrates philosophical disputing to someone who is very
angry with another’s behavior.
Now I’ll show you how at “D,” disputing, you can recognize and start to
change your irrational thinking. You are telling yourself:
1
“He shouldn’t have done that!” In other words, you are now saying
that “Because he could have done better, treated me more fairly, and it would
have been preferable had he done so. Therefore he absolutely must not have
treated me unfairly!” Well that doesn’t make sense. No matter how
preferable it is for him to treat you fairly and no matter how capable he
is of doingso thereisno lawof theuniverse thathe has to do so. And howcan
you say again “He must not have done it” when he did? It just doesn’t make
any sense, but that’s what you believe. Nutty! Why must he not act
obnoxiously? Why shouldn’t a fallible human act fucked up and fallibly?
If he acts obnoxiously he has to act obnoxiously, especially after he has done
so. And you’re whining and crying, “He shouldn’t have done what he
indubitably did!” Those poor Martians will tear their hair and run back to
Mars when they hear us Earthians spout this nonsense. “He shouldn’t have
done what he indubitably did!” Of course, if he did it he did it! So he behaves
badly – tough! So your must not and should not is drivel.
2
Why is it awful that he acted that way? Prove it, where is the
evidence? “D” is a question which you very rarely ask about your
awfulizing but which you often ask about physics, chemistry, and experi-
mental psychology. You neglect to question your own crazy hypothesis
about yourself. You question the law of gravity. Prove the law of gravity.
Or “where is the evidence that the earth is really round instead of ﬂat?”
And you come up with evidence and you either support or give up the
hypothesis. So you say at “D” – “Where is the evidence that it’s awful that
he treated me unfairly?” Answer: there isn’t any real evidence for awful-
ness, horror, terribleness. Because awful doesn’t mean obnoxious. When
you say “It’s awful” you mean not only that it’s very obnoxious – which it
well may be. You also mean that it’s totally obnoxious that he treated you
unfairly. Yes, 100 percent. And by awful you mean that it’s more than 100
percent obnoxious – it’s 101 percent or 110 percent obnoxious. Any
Martian could tell you, assuming that they are not as crazy as we, that these
are magical hypotheses – they have no evidence behind them, they can’t be
veriﬁed. And all your devout beliefs in them – and you often devoutly
believe in them – are utter hogwash because you can’t support them.
Let’s look at these awfulizing assumptions. “It’s 100 percent obnoxious.
It’s totally obnoxious that he treated me unjustly.” Well, obviously, it isn’t
100 percent, it’s probably 60 or 70 percent, because 100 percent obnoxious
means that he’d have to boil you in oil slowly. And 100 percent obnoxious
means the worst thing he could do to you. Well, how could he do that?
That’s a little unlikely. And suppose he boils you in oil slowly. Even that’s
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
54

not 100 percent. He could make the oil hotter! He could boil you more
slowly! So you’d never get up to 100 percent.
And then you’re claiming, by awfulizing, “It’s 101 percent or 110
percent obnoxious.” Well how the hell could it even be 101 percent?
Obnoxious can only go from 12 to 99.9 percent. It can’t reach 101. And
every time you claim awfulness about anything you really believe it’s more
than obnoxious. That can’t be, no matter how devoutly you say it, and
even if 100 out of 100 people agree with you, it’s still hogwash.
3
Prove that “I can’t stand him treating me this badly.” You can, of
course, stand it because you can stand anything that occurs to you until
you die. A few things, like him shooting you, you can’t stand and still live.
But you can live when he treats you unfairly though you won’t feel very
pleasant about it. “I can’t stand it!” also means “since he has treated me
unfairly, I can’t stand it and enjoy life at all.” But how true is that? Very
little! So where isthe evidence for “I can’t stand it?” Answer, there isn’t any.
4
“Because he did what he shouldn’t do he is a worm, he is a turd, he is
a louse for acting that way!” There are good reasons why your deduction,
“He is a turd!” is nutty. Because a turd, a rat, a louse, a no-goodnik doesn’t
mean somebody who often or usually acts badly, it means someone whose
essence is turdhood. That’s what it means. Think about it. Don’t accept
my interpretation – think about it. And if his essence were turdness, if he
had a core, an essence, a substance of turdness, then he would always and
under all conditions have to act turdily. Well that’s a little implausible,
because as I say to people all the time, even Hitler and Stalin occasionally
did a good deed. Hitler was kind to his mother, his dog, and his woman
friend. So if he or Stalin were real turds, how could they do any good
deeds? Besides, the essence of lousehood, slobhood, rottenness, which
you’re attributing to him, means that he is damnable, that the universe
spies on him, observes him acting turdily and proclaims: “Ah, we have
passed a special law that he doesn’t deserve any goodness at all in life
because he acted like a turd.” That’s highly implausible! That the universe
gives a shit for him is itself implausible. And that it really spies on him and
punishes him, and puts him into hell because he acted badly is most
implausible and most sadistic on the part of the universe. Because he is, of
course, a fallible human like the rest of us. And you are imagining that the
universe is obsessed with zapping him for his fallibility. Very unlikely,
most implausible! But that’s what you believe when you view him as a
rotten louse. Now in REBT we encourage your disputing of your irrational
beliefs steadily: “Why is it awful that he treated me badly?” “Prove that I
can’t stand it.” “Where is the validity, the proof, the evidence, that he
shouldn’t act that way?” “In what manner is he a turd for acting turdily?”
And we want you to think these questions through and see that evidence
for absolutistic shoulds, awfulizing, I can’t-stand-its, and human worm-
hood does not exist.
Refusing to Become Desperately Unhappy
55

Now if you ask these questions and really think about the answers don’t
merely take it on faith – if you really think it through you’ll end up
with “E.”
“E” is a new rational effect, a new effective philosophy. “E” is a strong
and generalized new rational belief: “What he did to me and what
anybody might do to me by acting unfairly and unjustly is certainly not
good, certainly deplorable, certainly something I don’t want. So it’s
something I don’t want. But there’s no reason why I can’t stand it, put
up with it, even have some happiness in spite of it. Now what the hell am
I going to do to either change him to treat me fairly, to get away from
him, or live with this unfairness?” That’s a new effective rational
philosophy that you can end up with at point “E.” (Ellis public lecture)
Ellis has devised the “REBT Self-Help Report Form,” which can be used to
help you actively dispute your irrational beliefs and arrive at a new effective
rational philosophy. This form has been ﬁlled in as shown here in connection
with the irrational beliefs (iBs) you might have if you observed that another
person was treating you unfairly by not being on time for an engagement (A,
your activating event) and if you felt very angry (C, your emotional conse-
quence) about this event.
Disputing methods that focus on changing feelings
People who demonstrate changes in their thinking from irrational to rational,
sometimes do not immediately experience changes in their feelings and
behavior. These people have the dilemma of getting their gut to accept what
the brain knows to be true.
REBT provides a number of methods that speed up the emotional change
process. The rationale for these methods is that many emotional reactions have
become so habitually experienced that they are strongly under the inﬂuence of
outside events. While we know that emotions stem largely from thinking, these
emotional change methods are designed to make people more aware of their
subconscious irrational thinking as well as to help re-establish self-control of
their feelings and behavior.
Rational-emotive imagery (REI) is a widely employed emotional change
method. The use of imagery involves people imagining themselves as
vividly as possible in a problematic situation. To employ positive imagery, you
imagine yourself in a bad situation but make yourself feel better and behave more
adaptively. You can do this by thinking rationally in the bad situation you are
imagining. To use negative imagery, you picture yourselves in the situation and
make yourself ﬁrst feel very upset (for example, depressed or enraged) and then
you imagine yourself in the same bad situation but this time feeling more
appropriately negative (for example, displeased or irritated). You can do this
largely through rethinking your view about the bad event.

In the following dialogue, Ellis uses rational-emotive imagery with a woman
whogetsextremelyangrywithherboyfriendforavarietyofhisbehaviors.Dorishas
publically volunteered to appear in front of a large audience to demonstrate REI,
and, hopefully learn to deal with her anger. Ellis knows almost nothing about her
background and history. Prior to using the imagery procedure with her, Ellis had
disputed with Doris her irrational demands concerning her boyfriend’s behavior
and her tendency to blame and condemn him.

doesn’t do it. And he has no good reason for not doing it. Can you
vividly imagine that happening?
DORIS:
Mmm.
ELLIS:
And how do you honestly feel in your gut as you imagine it?
DORIS:
I’m angry.
ELLIS:
All right make yourself as angry as you can. Really get yourself feeling
very angry . . . All right, he’s still doing it, don’t change that picture.
He’s still acting abominably, badly. Now make yourself feel only
disappointed, not angry, as you imagine that. Tell me when you feel
disappointed, but not angry.
DORIS:
Okay.
ELLIS:
Open your eyes. How did you change your feelings from anger to
disappointment?
DORIS:
Well, I just talked to myself.
ELLIS:
Yeah, and said what?
DORIS:
“If I get angry it’s going to get worse. I can feel disappointed by
showing myself that this is only one incident, he doesn’t always act
that way. So I can just try to have a cooler head and communicate
rather than scream.”
ELLIS:
That was very good. Now, what I want you to do for the next thirty
days is to make yourself as angry as you can. Then, change it to
disappointment the way you just did, which was good, or by using
other ways, other rational beliefs, which will occur to you.
DORIS:
Am I supposed to get myself angry every day and then get myself to
where I get disappointed?
ELLIS:
Right, for the next thirty days, not forever.
DORIS:
So it’s just in my relationship with him?
ELLIS:
No, it could be anything else. If you want to imagine something else
where you normally get angry – at your mother or father or friends or
anything else – that’s okay too. Make yourself very angry and then
work on accepting them as they are; not liking their behavior but
feeling sorry, disappointed, but not damning them.
REI can be used to overcome a variety of common emotional problems people
experience. Let us see how Ellis provides it for a woman who is very frustrated and
anxious about not ﬁnishing her university degree. Ellis spent most of this public
demonstration disputing with Sandy her irrational beliefs that led her to procrasti-
nate. Inparticular, heshowed Sandy that her feelings ofanxiety were being causedby
her tendency to put herself down for procrastinating. To facilitate strong emotional
insight, Ellis employs rational-emotive imagery.
ELLIS:
Close your eyes and imagine that you’re still procrastinating
despite all my noble help and all the other noble help that the
members of this audience are soon going to give you. You’re still
procrastinating. Six months go by and a year goes by, and a year
Refusing to Become Desperately Unhappy
59

and a half goes by and you’re still procrastinating. Can you
imagine that happening?
SANDY:
Mmm.
ELLIS:
And how do you feel in your gut as you imagine that?
SANDY:
I’ll tell you, Sunday morning when my stomach turns over and it
wakes me up.
ELLIS:
Yeah, and how do you feel? Your stomach is turning over, right?
SANDY:
A physical feeling.
ELLIS:
And would we call that – if we gave it words – anxiety or frustration?
SANDY:
Very gross anxiety.
ELLIS:
All right, now let yourself feel very physical, very anxious. You’re
feeling anxious, really anxious?
SANDY:
Yes, I am.
ELLIS:
Now change your feeling only to one of disappointment. Make
yourself feel only disappointed at what you’re doing and not anxious
– which is really self-downing – about your procrastinating. Tell me
whenyouonlyfeeldisappointedorsorry,andnotanxious,whichyou
can make yourself do. Can you now do that?
SANDY:
Mmm.
ELLIS:
All right, open your eyes. How did you do that? What did you do?
SANDY:
It was a very cognitive process. I literally talked myself into . . .
ELLIS:
Into doing what? What did you do?
SANDY:
Inappropriately or not, by rationalizing.
ELLIS:
You mean by reasoning?
SANDY:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Saying what?
SANDY:
Iwasfeelingandsaying“IfIdon’tdoit,it’snotwhatIwanttohappen
soIprocrastinated. Andyouknow,it’s okay,theworldisnotgoingto
blow up, I’m not going to disappear.”
ELLIS:
That’s very good. That will work. That’s right. That will make you
sorry and disappointed and not down on yourself, not anxious.
Another popular REBT emotional change method used to get people to
give up their basic nutty ideas, beliefs, assumptions, and hypotheses, and to
really
believe
fairly
consistently
saner
hypotheses
and
premises
about
the universe are shame-attacking and risk-taking exercises. These exercises are
employed with people who are easily embarrassed or ashamed. They are afraid to
engage in self-enhancing activities that often entail risks (test taking, giving a
speech, making a date) because they view failure or rejection as a sign of their
worthlessness, and as being personally unbearable. Shame attacking and risk-
taking exercises which Ellis gives to people to do during the week involve doing
something “shameful,” “ridiculous,” or “risky” then doing them without shame
on anxiety, and with a view of them as being adventuresome and challenging.
Some of the activities Ellis has prescribed for people with shameful feelings
include walking a banana down the street on a red leash on a bright summer’s
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
60

day, wearing outlandish clothes, and walking into a drug store and loudly
ordering a gross of condoms. Risk taking exercises involve people purposefully
failing at some activity. These exercises lessen anxieties and provide people with
concrete evidence to dispute their irrational beliefs concerning failure, disap-
proval, and rejection.
Ellis has indicated that strong emotions largely consist of, or are at least
derived from, the quite vehement and dramatic things we say to ourselves. To
combat the effects of these self-statements, Ellis has proposed the use of
passionate self-statements as another emotional change technique. By making
people repeat, in a highly vigorous, passionate, and emotional manner, sets of
rational self-statements to themselves and others (e.g., “I can stand this!” “This
is a hassle, not a horror.”), they begin to believe in them and feel better.
Disputing methods that focus on changing behavior
REBT has always strongly encouraged people to force themselves to do things
that they ﬁnd hard or unpleasant to do. Between therapy sessions, Ellis
prescribes behavioral homework assignments in order to provide people
with new evidence about themselves, others, and the world in order that
they may refute their irrational beliefs. Shame attacking and risk-taking
exercises are also examples of behavioral disputation methods. Other examples
of behavioral change methods involve asking people to practice postponing
gratiﬁcations if they believe they cannot stand waiting for events; to seek out
rejection if they believe they cannot stand it; to do without things they believe
they need, and to do things poorly if they believe their self-worth is based on
doing well.
Assertion training is sometimes used by Ellis to help people overcome social
shyness.
We might give you assertion training. What happens in non-assertiveness
is that you are very displeased about your lover’s behavior hut you’re
scared shitless of telling him of your displeasure because he might not love
you and you idiotically think that you need – not desire – his love and that
you may become a turd without it. So you shut your trap and go along for
the ride. And he even may feel great for acting unjustly to you. And
sometimes you goad yourself into anger in order to assert yourself. But we
wouldgive you skilled assertion training so that you couldtell him, though
not always (for he might be your boss and you might have to shut your
mouth) tell him how you feel and how you’d like him to change, and have
an interchange with him and risk his disapproval – which we would show
you is really not that risky. We would give you tasks to assert yourself with
people like him or less threatening people ﬁrst, and then ﬁnally with him.

Operant conditioning is another behavioral change procedure Ellis employs
with people in order to motivate them to think, feel, and act in self-enhancing
ways. Ellis teaches people to reward themselves when they change old negative
habits, and penalize themselves when they don’t. Self-reward and self-penalty is
also used to motivate people to employ thinking, feeling, and behavior change
methods during the week.
In the following illustration, Ellis suggests operant conditioning to help a 32-
year-old male, Art, who wants to start exercising and getting ﬁt but who ﬁnds it
impossible to get out of bed in the morning.
ELLIS:
Now you had better work on getting rid of this notion that you
shouldn’t have to go through pain to get gain. Because as long as you
have that idea you’re not going to do any exercise. Then secondly you
can, if you want to, break the exercise down into reasonable segments.
What minimum could you do a day?
ART:
The minimum is that I could get up and walk. That would be the
minimum, it is the easiest thing to do.
ELLIS:
But would that be okay in the long run? If you walked for every single
day, for how long would you walk?
ART:
I think if I got to that point I would go ahead and do something else.
ELLIS:
Allright,butlet’ssetaminimumofwalking.Whatminimumofwalking

ART:

ELLIS:

you enjoy doing practically every day? What thing do you like that you
can allow yourself to do contingent on that 20 minutes a day of

ART:

minute walk. Okay?
ART:
Okay.
ELLIS:
Now, what is something you don’t like that you could force yourself to
do in case you don’t walk the twenty minutes? What do you abhor
doing and therefore normally avoid?
ART:
Vacuuming.
ELLIS:
If you don’t do the twenty minutes a day by bedtime, you stay up and
do an hour of vacuuming.
ART:
I’ve a very small apartment.
ELLIS:
Oh, but your neighbor’s will love you. They have all kinds of large
apartments. So you could just tell them that you’re going to be
available to vacuum their apartments. If you don’t do the twenty
minutes a day you’re going to be the most popular one in the
apartment house!

Operant conditioning can be used to combat irrational thinking.
Every time you do the anti-awfulizing, ask yourself “Why is it awful he acts
this way?” and “How can he be a bastard for a bastardly act?” you can give
yourself some reinforcement. Usually something that you really like to do
in your life, that you can contract to do every time you anti-awfulize. And
when you revel in your anger and don’t do anything to undo it,
philosophically and otherwise, you can give yourself a penalty. (Ellis
public lecture)
As mentioned earlier, Ellis views thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as closely
connected. And while he places the greater emphasis on the cause and effects of
irrational thinking, it is really people’s feelings, and in particular their behavior,
which determines how effective they are in achieving their long-term values of
survival, happiness, and the development of their unique potential. Ellis, therefore,
stresses the importance of creating changes in your feelings and behavior. The
methods just described are designed to produce changes in the three basic modes of
human experience. Ellis has found that if people change their self-defeating patterns
of feeling and behaving, they will learn to think more rationally about the world,
others, and most importantly, themselves.
The Elegant Solution
Ellis not only helps people overcome a speciﬁc problem they are experiencing,
butalsostrivesforaprofoundphilosophicchangesothattheycanrationallyand
constructively face present and future problems. And it is when people make
changes to their core philosophy – especially to their absolutistic irrational
beliefs – and become determined to utilize principles of rational living that they
move forward in their pursuit of happiness. This is what Ellis hypothesizes.
Ellis continued to devise increasingly efﬁcient methods in order to achieve an
enduring, stable, generalized and “elegant” solution to people’s problems. “And
ﬁnally we try to help you to give up the three major musts and stop being a
profound musturbater, because musturbation is the essence of human distur-
bance. The three musts are:
1
“I must do greatly, gloriously, grandly, outstandingly, be a genius like
Leonardo de Vinci, or else it’s awful, I can’t stand it, I’m no good and
I’ll never do anything well.” This leads to feelings of depression,
anxiety, despair, and worthlessness.
2
“Othersmusttreatmenoblyandkindlyandconsideratelyandputme
in the center of their attention. And isn’t it horrible if they don’t –
those lousy bastards!” This idea creates feeling of anger, rage,
resentment, fury, and warlikeness.

“Conditions must be easy and nice and give me everything I want on
a silver platter without my doing a goddamned thing to get it! And
isn’t it horrible that the damned world doesn’t give me everything
with ease and no effort.” This leads to low frustration tolerance,
gooﬁng and avoidance, and to addiction.
Now if you see those musts, if every time you feel upset, or act self-
defeatingly, or really do yourself in, you see that you’re believing one or two or
three of them and if you ﬁght and dispute them, challenge and question them,
you ﬁnally become saner. And if you do dispute your absolutistic musts a few
thousand times you become much saner ready to have a real ball in life. (Ellis
public lecture)
Fun and Humor
The following quotes are excerpted from various public lectures of Albert Ellis.
If neurotics take themselves, others, and the world conditions too
solemnly, why not poke the blokes with jolly jokes? Or split their shit
with wit?
Ellis uses humor in many different ways with the aim to attack directly and
forcefully people’s crazy, irrational ideas. He never, however, criticizes or pokes
fun at people, for one of the basic tenets of REBT consists of unconditionally
accepting people with their mistakes and idiocies.
My therapeutic brand of humor consists of practically every kind of
drollery ever invented – such as taking things to extremes, reducing ideas
to absurdity, paradoxical intention, puns, witticisms, irony, whimsy,
evocative language, slang, deliberate use of sprightly obscenity, and
various kinds of jocularity.
Part of Ellis’ humorous style is his unexpected use of obscenity. It is
interesting to witness how positively people react to Ellis’ use of obscenities.
Obscenities appear to give people hard-hitting insight into their irrationalities,
emotional satisfaction and relief from gloom and inertia, and may constitute
a type of anti-anxiety, diverting relaxant. While Ellis’ idiosyncratic wit
and humor are well represented throughout this book, here are a few speciﬁc
“Ellis-isms.”
On Men and Sex
Sex encourages us to practically worship women who are no goddamn
good for us.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
64

On Men and Love
Most people are bottomless pits. They are babies. The main diagnosis of
what most humans are is FBs – fucking babies. Because they will not accept
the reality that nobody truly gives that much of a shit for them all their
lives. People just don’t because they’re mainly interested in their own
navel. Practically all of them. So they don’t care for each other that much.
But they think they need others to care devoutly for them.
On Anger (Ellis talking to a person who gets angry when she can’t get what she
wants.)
People who are very angry are acting crazily, almost totally out of their
fucking minds. Anybody who is enraged at anything, even Hitler, is
thinking badly. If you can understand that, you can change your entire
existence. Oh, I see. “The universe must be run so that I always get what I
want. I should run the fucking universe!” Well, lots of luck on that one!
Maybe you’ll be the ﬁrst to achieve it.
On Children
The same thing goes for children. If children didn’t agree with their blasted
parents they would never think they’re shits. They’re nutty. They agree.
On Not Having Children (Ellis talking to a person worried about losing his
potency and not being able to have children.)
And that would be luck. Look at all the money you’d save. You’d never
have children on dope.
On Procrastination (Ellis talking to astudentwhoishavingdifﬁcultycompleting
her thesis.)
So you’re saying it’s more than it’s boring and hard. But there’s another
idea sneaking in there. Now what do you think that is? Because it’s boring
and hard, what? “I shouldn’t have to do that unfucking thesis!” But fucking is
a good thing so I try not to use it derogatively. So it’s an unfucking thesis. I
invented the term unfucking almost thirty years ago and I haven’t
convinced the American public to use it yet. Lennie Bruce took it from
me and used it in some of his comedy routines. He would end his
monologue by saying, “Dr. Albert Ellis, a well-known psychologist, says
we usually should say unfucking rather than fucking when we speak
negatively. So let me say to you, as I depart, unfuck you!” It’s obviously
an unfucking thesis – it can’t be a fucking thesis because then you’d like to
do it – we couldn’t keep you away from doing that thesis!
Refusing to Become Desperately Unhappy

On Exaggeration
There are no horrors except in our heads. We make hassles into horrors.
On Put Downs
Among New York intellectuals, there’s one thing they put others down for
. . . stupidity, that’s the real intellectual downer.
How does crummy behavior make anybody a damned crumb?
On the Acceptance of Reality
Life, whether you like it or not, generally gets spelled hassle. You rarely get
gain without pain.
Ellis has also composed a number of rational humorous songs that he often
employs with clients and in his RET talks and workshops. A number of them
appear in his book and his audiocassette, A Garland of Rational Songs (New
York: Albert Ellis Institute). Here are lyrics from one of his more popular
rational humorous songs.
I Wish I Were Not Crazy (To the tune of Dixie, composed by Dan Emmett)12
Oh, I wish I were really put together –
smooth and ﬁne as patent leather!
Oh, how great to be rated innately sedate!
But I’m afraid that I was fated
To be rather aberrated –
Oh, how sad, to be mad as my Mom and my Dad!
Oh, I wish I were not crazy! .Hooray! Hooray!
I wish my mind were less inclined
To be the kind that’s hazy!
I could agree to really be less crazy,
But I, alas, am just too goddamned lazy!

The Philosophy of Happiness:
Principles of Rational Living
How can you make yourself happy? Increased happiness and freedom
from disturbance can be achieved because all humans are born with
constructive and creative tendencies and are also born with the ability to
sharpen and increase their self-fulﬁlling tendencies.17
All people are born with a potential to lead fulﬁlling and happy lives. This
potential is what Ellis and others, including Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers,
call self-actualization, the innate biological process all humans possess to grow
and become fully functioning. With self-actualization, people possessthe innate
desire to utilize their unique aptitudes and constructive, creative problem
solving tendencies that orient them towards doing things that bring them
enjoyment and fulﬁllment.
However, the self-actualizing potential can be blocked by emotional difﬁ-
culties as well as inertia – the tendency to sit around and do nothing rather than
actively participating in diverse activities to discover those that do (and do not)
bring enjoyment and happiness.
Due to biological make-up and early childhood experiences, the self-actual-
izing process operates in different people at various strengths depending on
their life circumstances, emotional health, and willpower to overcome inertia.
Ellis argues that rationality is a potent force to help people achieve their goals
of long life and happiness. He has outlined a number of principles and practices

and more fulﬁlled lives.
In light of his many years of professional practice as well as his extensive
reading on the philosophy and psychology of human happiness, Ellis has
enumerated a set of principles of rational living that when people put into
practice on a regular basis, can have impressive effects on their self-actualization
and resultant personal happiness. These rational principles are as follows:
Rational Principle 1
Self-interest
Rational Principle 2
Social Interest
Rational Principle 3
Self-direction
Rational Principle 4
Self-acceptance
Rational Principle 5
Tolerance of Others
Rational Principle 6
Short-term and Long-term Hedonism
Rational Principle 7
Commitment to Creative, Absorbing
Activities and Pursuits
Rational Principle 8
Risk-taking and Experimenting
Rational Principle 9
High Frustration Tolerance and Willpower
Rational Principle 10
Problem Solving
Rational Principle 11
Scientiﬁc Thinking and Flexibility
Each of these 11 principles will be presented and discussed. As you read each
description, you can consider the extent to which you accept and practice the
principle and the extent to which it may need to be strengthened.
In order to be happy (and less disturbable), you will want to practice as
often as possible rational beliefs. Can you really do this? Yes, if you are
truly determined to make yourself less upsetable and happier, this requires
willpower.19
The ﬁnal section of this chapter will integrate the 11 principles as a rational
mindset for personal happiness.
Rational Principle 1: Self-interest
While taking care to avoid needlessly and gratuitously hurting others,
consistently try to remain you. On the one hand, devote yourself self-
interestedly to those pursuits likely to bring you the greatest satisfaction in
your relatively brief span of life; and, on the other hand, absorb yourself in
people and things outside yourself because you truly enjoy them. You have
a right to personal happiness and you have a right if necessary (and it
usually is), to get it.15
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
68

Over the years, Ellis grappled with what might seem to be an inherent moral or
ethical conﬂict between the self-interest he deems necessary for driving people’s
search for personal happiness and social interest that involves working towards
the betterment and welfare of others and general society.
According to Ellis, sensible and emotionally healthy people tend to be ﬁrst or
primarily interested in themselves and to put their own interests at least a little
above the interests of others. They sacriﬁce to some degree for those for whom
they care – but not overwhelmingly or completely.
As a realist, Ellis places self-interest a small step in front of social interest.
He believes that the attainment of happiness is more likely to be achieved
from individuals becoming absorbed in pursuits that bring them pleasure in
the short- and long-term and not from deﬁning the purpose of their lives as
serving the needs of others. He exhorts people to explore life in order to
experience the enjoyments and satisfactions that accompany the involvement
in activities that may have little to do with meeting the needs of others
(e.g., stamp collecting).
The more you go after what you want in life and are determined to get
something good for yourself (and possibly for others), the more you have
something special and unique to offer others – particularly those who
share love with you. Your very self-interested activity gives them some-
thing to sink their teeth into.15
Ellis believes that even when people are involved in stable and rewarding
relationships, the pursuit by the individuals of their own self-actualization
through experimenting and discovering activities and pursuits that interest
them and not their partners can strengthen the relationship.
There are disadvantages to striving for personal happiness that Ellis discusses.
Other people may conclude that people who put their own interests ﬁrst for
some of the time are cold and heartless – even if they’re not.
Satisfying yourself also takes time and trouble: for planning and scheming
about what you really want and how you can go about getting it; for being
assertive and resisting the demands of others; for experimenting with
things that you later discover you truly don’t want; for consciously, albeit
efﬁciently, striving for the long-range pleasure of tomorrow as well as the
short-range satisfactions of today. You rarely get something for nothing,
and self-interest has its hassles and limitations. But it’s usually worth it!15
To inject greater self-interest into a philosophy of happiness that is greatly
skewed towards making others happy and serving their interests, you can not
onlystateforcefully tooneself thatyouhavearight topursue yourown interests,
but you can also begin to consider those activities and pursuits that are open to
you and formulate a plan of action for greater participation.
The Philosophy of Happiness: Principles of Rational Living

Rational Principle 2: Social Interest
Strive for personal happiness in a social world. Individual and social living
inextricably merge, so that the summit of your individuality and freedom
involves real concern for others. Be yourself while helping others.15
Today, Ellis’ philosophy of personal happiness includes both self-interest and
social interest. According to Ellis, emotional health and self-actualization had
better always include people being concerned about the present and future
welfare of others.
While Ellis stresses the inalienable right of all humans to their own personal
happiness, Ellis espouses a doctrine that could be called rational morality
consisting of two basic rules: (1) be kind to yourself, and (2) do not harm
others.First,heencourageshisclientsandnon-clientsaliketofollowthroughon
their natural and self-actualizing desires and to pursue individual and personal
freedom without feeling guilty. Second, he encourages people to be ethically
responsible in their pursuitof happiness sothat their individual actions donot –
especially in a pre-meditated way – hurt others or interfere with their rights to
being treated with respect nor harm society.
Ellis accepts that social interest and involvements abet personal happiness.
Someofthemostfulﬁllingaspectsofpeople’slivesarewhentheymakeconcerted
efforts to become involved in helping other people realize their potential.
Ellis has indicated that social interest is usually rational and self-helping
because most people choose to live and enjoy themselves in a social group or
community. And if they do not act morally, protect the rights of others, and abet
social survival, it is unlikely that they will create the kind of enjoyable relation-
ships and to live in a group and community in which they themselves can live
comfortably and happily.
In fact, Ellis recognizes that maximally, fully functioning people are deeply
ethical, trustworthy and socialized. Endorsing the ﬁndings of the general
semanticist Hayakawa, Ellis acknowledges that fully functioning people tend
to be considerate and fair to others, to avoid needlessly hurting others, engage in
collaborative and cooperative endeavors, and at times are altruistic and enjoy a
fair degree of interpersonal and group relationships.
To strengthen social-interest, you can remind yourself that for most people,
great satisfaction is experienced when they volunteer their time and interest in
helpinganotherorservingacausenotasameansofprovingthemselves,butsolely
for the purpose of helping others. You can then go about identifying a person or a
cause and the kind of effort and time commitment you are prepared to make.
Rational Principle 3: Self-direction
If you don’t search for personal happiness, no one else is going to do it for
you.15
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
70

Ellis is clear on this point. It’s a risky business for people to hope and expect
other people (family, partner) and the organization they work for to look after
their happiness. Ellis notes that others are not infrequently self-concerned and
engage in self-interested and sometimes unfair and inconsiderate behavior that
can thwart the happiness of others. As a result, he’s all for people thinking about
how best to be happy and to realize that there is no law of the universe that says
that anyone deserves to be happy. People have to go after it.
Planning your personal happiness is an enormous, challenging task that
pits you against some of the most powerful forces in the universe. For, as
Voltaire sagely noted, this is not the best of all possible worlds. Life is ﬁlled
with a constant series of muddles and puddles. It is not, as we teach
horrible and awful; but it is frequently a royal pain in the ass. And if you
actively seek happiness, you mean that you will fully accept the challenge
of this difﬁcult existence and will be utterly determined to make it less
difﬁcult for you personally and, in fact, damned exciting and enjoyable.15
Ellis indicates in his no-nonsense style that if people’s basic philosophy is one
of running their own lives as well as they can and being happy in spite of
innumerable troubles experienced by everyone from time-to-time, they then
have an excellent chance of being spirited and joyful even in this, oftentimes,
crummy world. What is more, people also have a much better chance of being
able to make some signiﬁcant contribution towards improving that world.
Only by working at planning, plotting, scheming, and steadily acting at it
are you likely to become more fully and self-actualized.5
To become more self-directed, you make the decision to actively plan for
those experiences and pursuits that you forecast will bring you greater short-
and long-term pleasure and happiness. You also examine your current and
anticipated future life style and make decisions about those activities you are
engaged in that bring you displeasure and see – sometimes through negotiation
with signiﬁcant others – if they can be shared or eliminated.
Rational Principle 4: Self-acceptance
My newer theory of personality says you don’t have value at all, you don’t
have such a thing as intrinsic worth. Some other theories say, “You are a
good person because you are alive.” Now we would say, “You are not a
good or a bad person, you are just a person who does good and bad things.”
That is clearly deﬁnable. You don’t have a self. It’s hard for people to
understand that and to only rate their deeds and traits and not their self or
essence; because the strong tendency to rate yourself is part of the human
condition.
The Philosophy of Happiness: Principles of Rational Living
71

People choose to believe that there is some God who likes them – which
theycanneverreally prove –andthat,therefore,theyaregood.Evenifthere
was such a God, how could they prove that He or She liked them? They
actually choose to believe this and, therefore, choose to think “I’m okay.”
They think that something out there is making them worthwhile, and they
won’t un-hypocritically admit, “It is my choice of something to believe in
that is making me okay.” So you have a choice, every human has a choice.
You can choose to accept or reject yourself. (Ellis public lecture)
Self-acceptance is a rational belief that liberates people to grow. By eliminating
the rating of self, people eliminate their anxiety and feelings of inadequacy and
are free to make mistakes and risk rejection from others in their quest for
discovering what they truly enjoy doing.
As illustrated in Chapter 1, Ellis advances the argument that much emotional
misery that blocks human happiness is based on people rating themselves as
good or bad, depending on how well they achieve or whether they are being
approved of by signiﬁcant others. This kind of global rating of self-worth is self-
defeating because people spend their lives seeking and demanding assurances
from others and from their work that they are worthwhile, rather than pursuing
enjoyment.
Ellis stresses that human beings are not rateable as there is no universally
accepted standard for judging the worth of people. People rate themselves (and
others) using arbitrary deﬁnitions of good and bad. Ellis rejects any notion of
universalistic good or bad and adopts the position that while it is beneﬁcial for
people to measure their own traits and behaviors, it is not possible to use their
performances as a basis for globally rating themselves.
Suppose I said to a Martian, I’m talking to this intelligent Earthian and
he’s devoutly believing, “One of my important behaviors stinks and,
therefore, I am a stinker.” Let’s suppose the Martian is intelligent,
perceptive, and rational. What would he think about this earthling?
Probably, “How can he be so nutty? His behavior stinks, but he has
millions of behaviors and they all are different and all tend to change. How
can he therefore rate his self, his totality?” The Martian would be right.
Suppose we had a basket of fruit. It has apples and pears and oranges.
And some of the apples and pears and oranges are good and some are bad.
Now what’s the rating of the basket? Is it a good basket or a bad basket? Or is
it a basket with good and bad fruit?
Suppose you go out of here and you see a child almost get run over by an
automobile and you run under the car and save the child and you almost
get killed yourself. That’s a good deed.
Does that make you a good person? You might think so but you would
be wrong because the next moment you might murder your mother. (Ellis
public lecture)
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
72

Ellis consistently discusses the importance of people enjoying themselves
rather than proving themselves.
To become more self-accepting, begin by taking stock of your wide variety
of good-positive and bad-negative characteristics and behaviors many of
which change over time. Rather than arbitrarily settling on any subset as
the one that you will use to judge your value and worth as a person such as
successful performance at work or in one’s relationships, you eliminate as
much as possible the rating of your total self-worth based on these
characteristics.
Rational Principle 5: Tolerance of Others
Emotionally sound people are prone to take an unbigoted (or, at least, less
bigoted) view of the inﬁnitely varied people, ideas, and things in the world
around them.22
Ellis has written in The Road to Tolerance that much personal and social evil
stems from several related philosophies (cultural, religious, political and
individual) characterized by intolerance, bigotry, absolutism, rigidity and
fanaticism. He indicates that these extreme attitudes play an important part
in emotional misery and, as such, block human happiness. Ellis’ hope is that in
teaching people around the world to be tolerant and open-minded much less
harm and much greater good is likely to result.
There is little question that people who are tolerant of others display high
levels of social intelligence. This is displayed in two ways. First, they are aware of
the many and varied positive characteristics in people who come from diverse
cultures and different backgrounds. This awareness includes looking beyond
speciﬁc disagreeable behaviors of individuals and groups and being open-
mindedinconsideringtheirstrengths.Second,peoplewhoaretolerantofothers
also display what Ellis calls unconditional other-acceptance.
Unconditional other-acceptance means that you do not tolerate the anti-
social and sabotaging actions of other people and you try to help them
change. But you always accept them, their personhood, and you never
damn their total selves. You tolerate their humanity while disagreeing with
some of their actions.22
The judgment of people’s worth on the basis of their behavior is really at the
core of most bigotry including racism, sexism, and ageism. Rage, hostility, and
aggression stem from intolerance.
Ellis discusses that all human beings are fallible, mistake-makers who from
time-to-time act in ignorant and self-serving, selﬁsh ways.
The Philosophy of Happiness: Principles of Rational Living
73

Do not expect too much of other people for they almost always have their
own serious problems and are preoccupied mainly with them. Even when
they say they cherish you, they are rarely that much on your side. (Ellis
public lecture)
Ellis argues that it makes no logicalsense to judge the overall value or worth of
people. Such a judgment would be based on an arbitrary selection of traits and
behaviors upon which to make such a determination. On any one day a person
may harmfully yell at a loved one but help an older person across the street. How
will the worth of that person be judged?
Instead, Ellis endorses the Christian position of accepting all sinners but not
their sins. He says that people can then choose to, in a non-disturbed way,
disengage themselves from people whose behavior they ﬁnd immoral and
harmful or ﬁrmly try to induce them and even penalize them to change their
behavior.
In his explication of tolerance, Ellis also helps people refute the notion that
because the world is so full of human suffering including cruel violence and
terrorismthatitisatotallydespicableplaceandpeoplecannotcontinuetolivein
it and be at all happy. To develop tolerance of others further, make a
determination to view other people in terms of the ways in which they are
similar and different from you. When you meet with or read about individuals
or groups whose behavior or customary ways of doing things is disagreeable or
unacceptable to you, take the time to ﬁnd out more about their positive traits
and refrain from making overall judgments of them as people.
Rational Principle 6: Short-term and
Long-term Hedonism
Well-adjusted people tend to seek both the pleasures of the moment and
thoseofthefuture,anddonotoftencourtfuturepainforpresentgain.They
are hedonistic, that is, happiness-seeking and pain avoidant, but they
assume they will probably live for quite a few years and that they had better
think of both today and tomorrow, and not be obsessed with immediate
gratiﬁcation.16
While Ellis has been criticized for being crassly hedonistic (seeking pleasure
and freedom from pain) and that teaching people to enjoy themselves at the
expense of their deeper, or more rewarding commitments (to others), this
view is false.
Despite helping people to alleviate emotional distress and to pursue activities
that bring immediate gratiﬁcation and short-term pleasure, one of the main
principles of rational living espoused by Ellis is the Stoic principle of long-range
rather than short-term hedonism.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
74

My philosophy of happiness is honestly hedonistic . . . it endorses the
principle of long-range rather than short-range hedonism: Minimize your
needless pain and maximize your pleasures of today – and of tomorrow.
(Ellis public lecture)
As Ellis notes, the short-term hedonistic philosophy of “Drink, eat and be
merry, for tomorrow you may die” has its distinct limitations. It is unrealistic
because most of the time you don’t die and are much more likely to live and
rue the consequences of too much eating, drinking, and partying. As a conse-
quence, the reality principle of present pleasures for future gain is often a much
more sensible path to pursue than the pleasure principle of striving mainly for
present gains.
Ellis discouraged his clients and non-clients from doing things the easy way
but rather counseled them to do things the more rewarding way that oftentimes
require the delay of gratiﬁcation which, in the short-run, is often more difﬁcult.
To inculcate hedonism as part of your philosophy of happiness, search for
activities that bring you enjoyment without feeling guilty or ashamed. You
may need to assert yourself more fully in this search. At the same time, give up
all forms of procrastination and make the sacriﬁces in the short-term of
immediate pleasure and make the effort in doing things that are unpleasant
and frustrating that are necessary to bring you pleasantness and fulﬁllment in
the long-term.
Rational Principle 7: Commitment to Creative,
Absorbing Activities and Pursuits
Attempt to make yourself vitally absorbed in some persons or things
outside yourself. Attachment to things, objects, projects, and causes has its
great rewards, and may well enhance your life. Ideally, you can love both
persons and things. But if you impel yourself, especially for a period of
time, into a vitally absorbing interest, you may greatly enjoy yourself. In
many respects, then, it would appear that action, particularly when it takes
the form of creative, intensely absorbing activity, proves one of the
mainstays of happy, human living. If you (consciously or unconsciously)
believe otherwise and live by a philosophy of inertia and inaction, you will
sabotage your own potential satisfaction.19
Without question, one of the most important insights Ellis offers on
happiness is the importance of becoming involved in creative and vitally
absorbing pursuits and activities that offer immediate pleasure and enjoy-
ment in their doing and, when pursued over time at work, in relationships
and vocationally, result in satisfaction and fulﬁllment. Ellis indicates three
main forms of vital absorption: (1) loving or feeling absorbed in other people,
The Philosophy of Happiness: Principles of Rational Living
75

(2) creating or getting absorbed in things, and (3) philosophizing or getting
absorbed in ideas.
Activity then, isthe meansby which wedevelop our self-actualizing potential.
Not all activity though, for Ellis is quite insistent that passive absorption in
activities results in lower degrees of pleasure and satisfaction than action-
oriented doing activities.
As you are biologically, socially and culturally different from all other
human beings, we had better not be too presumptive and try to tell you
what you can most enjoy and how to go about achieving pinnacles of
pleasure. In most ways, this is for you, and no one but you, to discover.
You don’t have to discover an absorbing ﬁeld spontaneously. You may
have to look around for something vital, push yourself experimentally
into a chosen ﬁeld, and persist at it for a while before you really become
absorbed in it.10
Ellisprovidesguidelinesforpeopletodiscoverthingstodothatarepersonally
absorbing and that bring them pleasure.
In his book with Irving Becker, A Guide to Personal Happiness, the kinds of
actions people can take to bring about fuller living include:
1
You can attempt to get vitally absorbed in some persons or things outside
yourself. Ideally, you can love both persons and things (and ideas).
2
Try to ﬁnd some persons or things in which you can honestly get absorbed for
their own sake and not for “ego-raising” reasons. You have a perfect right as a
human, to devote yourself selﬁshly to the most attractive person in town or to an
avocation, such as coin collecting, which has relatively little social value.
3
In devoting yourself to any ﬁeld of endeavor, try to choose a challenging, long-
range project or area rather than something simple or short-ranged.
4
Don’t expect vital absorptions to develop quickly. You may at ﬁrst have to push
yourself,experimentallyandforcefully,intoacertainﬁeldofendeavor,andmake
yourself stick at it for a reasonable period of time before you really begin to get
absorbed in and fascinated by it.

Think about varying your interests and having some minor side project going,
even if you get absorbed in some major endeavor. Humans dote on variety as
well as sustained goals; and you can go stale if you only concentrate on one
pursuit.
6
You can combat inertia and inaction by tracking down your own anxieties and
hostilities that lie at their source.
7
It takes more than self-talk. In the ﬁnal analysis, you often would better literally
force yourself, propel yourself, push yourself into action.
8
You can deliberately adopt a different role for a period of time and force yourself
to live up to this assumed role . . . for a week, act as one of the most outgoing and
assertive individuals you may know.15
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness

Ellis discusses ways for ferreting out vital pleasures that may well apply to the
individual. Uncovering people’s idiosyncratic likes and dislikes largely involves
them asking themselves – and as honestly as possible answering – several key
questions.
1
“What might I like?” Ask this question on a regular basis. Ellis provides a
list of some of the major areas in which people often ﬁnd highly satisfying
pursuits. He encourages people to ﬁnd out more about those they ﬁnd
interesting. He encourages people to experiment with those they think
they might enjoy.
2
“What things would I ﬁnd zestful?” The challenge here is for people to
discover what they uniquely like and dislike. The individual is never
obligated to enjoy those things that a majority of people seem to enjoy.
“You, just because you are you, are fully entitled to your odd or peculiar
values and disvalues. Remember that!”
3
“What do other people enjoy?” One of the best ways to discover what an
individual really wants to do is to learn as much as they can about other
people’s gratiﬁcations, to think about how they might work for them, to try
some of them on for size, and then to see how pleasing they really are. People
would rarely love music, art, science, or anything else unless they had some
real information about these interests.
4
“What will I probably like later?” Many pleasures of today not only pall
tomorrow but also produce distinct disadvantages – e.g., smoking, drinking
alcohol, or running when you have problems with your feet. Other enjoy-
ments–e.g.,becomingadeptatballetorbasketball–mayserveyourinterests
for a while but be impractical in your later life. So people can look for
enjoyments that will bring them pleasure today – but that will also probably
provide a long-range involvement.
5
“WhatwouldprobablybemoreenjoyablethansomeofthethingsInowdo?”
People’s range of possible pleasures is so wide and their available time to
pursue them so limited that choosing almost anything to throw themselves
into often provides them with relatively limited gain.
6
“What are the costs of some of my pleasures?” Joining a country club may be
a ﬁne interest but can it be really afforded? Playing golf is a great sport but do
people really have time for it? All pleasures have obvious or hidden costs of
time, energy, and money. So people had better ask themselves not only “Do I
enjoy this pastime?” but also “Is it worth it?”
7
“How can I experiment with possible pleasures?” People can learn about
what they like and dislike through experimentation – by trial and error. If
they are wise, they will inform themselves about many possible pleasures
and then experiment with at least several that they think they may
personally enjoy.
8
“How long shall I persist in my pleasure-hunting experiments?” People had
better try a would-be possible pleasure a reasonable number of times before
they decide that they don’t, and never will, like it.
The Philosophy of Happiness: Principles of Rational Living
77

9
“Need I ever feel ashamed or guilty about my enjoyments?” When people are
feeling ashamed or guilty, they are telling themselves, (a) “My acts are bad or
wrong,” and (b) “I am a really rotten person for committing these rotten
acts.” The second belief is irrational. A person can make themself feel like a
person who is acting irresponsibly (to others and/or yourself) and who had
better change his/her poor behavior. But that person had better not see
themself as a putrid, undeserving human.
An important note on the importance of identifying vitally absorbing
interests: the psychologist Csikszentmihalhyi discusses “ﬂow experience” ac-
tivities in which people become so intensively or ﬂowingly involved that they
derive unusual fun or joy. These activities are similar to what Ellis calls a “vital
absorbing interest” often adding to their enjoyment.
To become more involved in creative and absorbing pursuits requires self-
reﬂection.Whataresomeofyourhiddenawaytalentsandintereststhatyoumay
only be dimly aware of that could be developed and applied at work and in other
avocations? Ask friends and family to gain additional insights. Then, formulate
an action plan that frequently requires you ﬁnding the time in a full life where
you think nothing more is possible.
Rational Principle 8: Responsible Risk-taking and
Experimenting
Emotionally healthy people tend to take a fair amount of risk and try to do
what they want to do, even when there is a good chance they may fail. They
tend to be adventurous but not foolhardy. Discover, through thinking,
experimenting, and risk-taking, what you personally want todo (and want
not to do),with the one life you have and how to do (and not todo) exactly
that.5
In his classic text, Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy, Ellis writes that self-
actualization and long-term hedonism are assisted when people experiment
with many tasks and projects to discover what they really want and don’t want.
In order to achieve maximum involvement in life including heightened,
deepened, and new enjoyments, Ellis counsels that people keep risking new
defeats and failures.
What this principle encourages is for people to try a wide range of activities
at work and beyond and to willingly engage in new projects where they are
unsure if they have the skill-set to be successful; especially, the ﬁrst time
around the track.
Ellis encourages people to design risk-taking activities, where they believe
there is a high likelihood of failure to help them combat their fear of failure and
performance anxiety by providing evidence that failure is not the end of the
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
78

world and they can stand to fail. Risk-taking activities also help people to extend
their usual, dailyexperiencesandby moving outof their comfort zones, increase
the opportunity and likelihood they will ﬁnd new experiences of interest, which
bring pleasure.
Ellis calls for responsible risk-taking where the risk associated with potential
failure is not one with a high probability of dire consequences if one does fail
such as being ﬁred from a job for incompetence. For example, if you do not feel
up to assuming a management or leadership role on a project or you tend to
dodge assignments that involve public speaking, you deliberately volunteer for
managementand/orpublicspeakingopportunitieswhentheyariseeventhough
you know you might not be successful at ﬁrst. Through such experimentation,
you learn more about what you are interested in (and good at) and you gain the
opportunity to redesign your life when you discover new, absorbing, and
creative pursuits.
Healthy men and women tend to acknowledge and accept the idea that we
seem to live in a world of probability and chance, whereas absolute
certainties do not, and probably never will, exist. They realize that it is
often fascinating and exciting, and deﬁnitely not horrible, to live in this
kind of probabilistic world. They enjoy a great deal of order but do not
demand to know exactly what the future will bring or what will happen to
them.16
Ellis has written about the acceptance of uncertainty as an important insight
that enables people to take risks without knowing of having any certainty in
advance of the outcome.
To become more of a risk-taker requires you to move out of your comfort
zone when searching for pleasurable and fulﬁlling activities. Risk-taking re-
quiresarippingupofthatpartofyourmindsetthatsays:“Icouldneverdothat,”
“That’s not me,” and “I don’t know enough to put my hand up to do that.”
Deliberately push yourself to experiment on doing things that are not typically
you but which seem to have some appeal.
Rational Principle 9: High Frustration Tolerance and
Willpower
Millions of people believe the idea that you can achieve maximum human
happiness by inertia and inaction or by passivity and uncommittedly
“enjoying” yourself.10
Ellis consistently points out that hard work, effort and persistence are essential
ingredients of a rational philosophy of happiness because:
The Philosophy of Happiness: Principles of Rational Living
79

1
Humans rarely feel particularly happy or alive when inert, except for short
periods of time between their exertions. They get bored and listless when
constantly at rest.
2
Most intelligent and perceptive people seem to require vitally absorbing
activity to stay maximally alive and happy. Highly intelligent adults rarely
remain enthusiastic and gratiﬁed for any length of time unless they have some
rather complex, absorbing, and challenging occupations or avocations.
3
To some degree, human contentment seems almost synonymous with
absorption in outside people and events – goal orientation.
4
Living essentially means doing, acting, loving, creating, and thinking. You
negate it by prolonged gooﬁng, loathing, or lazing.
5
When people ﬁght against initial inertia and propel themselves into activity,
they come to enjoy these actions (and sometimes their results) far more than
they would enjoy prolonged inactivity.
Ellis differentiates having the will and having willpower to work on
becoming happier. Will means having or making a choice or decision.
You choose to do (or not to do) something or you make a decision to do
(or not to do) something. The will to change (to be less upset about someone’s
behavior; to try out new, potentially rewarding activities) only means you
decide to change – and then you may or may not work very hard at doing so.
However, willpower is different and harder than merely expressing your will
to change for with willpower you not only have the power to make the decision
but you follow it up in practice.
Push yourself to achieve a goal, be determined to carry it through, gain
knowledge of how to do so, take suitable actions to back up your
determination and knowledge, force yourself to persist at that action
no matter how hard it is, and go through this process again if you fall back
to having “weak willpower.”19
In his book, How to Make Yourself Happy, Ellis provides the following steps
that people need to take in exercising their willpower:
1
Be determined to do something.
2
Gain knowledge of what to do and what not to do to carry out your will.
3
Put belief into action to make yourself do it.
4
Persist with action even when you ﬁnd it difﬁcult to carry out.
5
When you fail to act and fall back, go through the process again and again.
To internalize greater high-frustration tolerance and to exhibit willpower
requires you to accept the principle of “no gain, no pain.” This often means
forcefully instructing yourself that you can stand doing things and putting up
withpeoplethatyoudon’t like.Italsomeansdedicating yourselftoseeingthings
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
80

through that you set off to do rather than putting them off until another day
when you have more time or you are in the mood.
Rational Principle 10: Problem Solving
Recognize there are almost always alternate solutions to your problems
and that you can always ﬁnd other enjoyments when some of your main
ones are thwarted. Whenever you are in trouble, keep looking for
solutions to your problems and possible pleasures you can still arrange.
To be happy, you have to realize that hard work is a permanent ongoing
process – a way of life. As a human, you have to get organized, and then,
stay organized, which calls for ongoing problem solving.20
Albert Ellis has always been a master at solving problems, be they his own or
those of his clients. There is little question that he views the ability to solve
problems as an aspect of rationality that serves well our desire to be happy.
Ellisis realisticconcerning life.Whenpeople create goalstoachieveinareasof
work, relationships and comforts, these goals create and bring with them many
practical problems to solve. How shall you get a good education? What shall you
do to ﬁnd a suitable mate? Which profession should you choose and how shall
you succeed at it? What recreations do you ﬁnd enjoyable and worthy of your
time and effort?
Ellisprovidesveryimportantinformationabouttheproblem-solvingprocess
by identifying two types of problems people experience when confronted with
obstacles that block their goals.
Practical problems are those that people experience with reality. Common
examples are sub-standard work performance (e.g., failing a test; not achieving
monthly performance goals) and interpersonal difﬁculties and challenges with
family, friends and at work (e.g., partner giving you a hard time, colleague not
following through on a commitment, manager treating you disrespectfully,
ending of a relationship, meeting someone new).
Emotional problems are generally those extreme emotional reactions inside
you (e.g., panic, depression, self-hatred, rage) about a reality problem with
something or someone. Ellis says that once you recognize your reality problem,
you can try to solve it – or you can foolishly choose to make yourself extremely
upset about it.
Ellis encourages people to do their best to solve their practical problems and
provides many methods that are widely employed in business, industry,
management, and education. The following list contains examples of some
of the methods he suggests (from How to Make Yourself Happy and Remarkably
Less Disturbed).
.
Avoid taking on to many problems that have deadlines and that require
quick solutions.
The Philosophy of Happiness: Principles of Rational Living
81

.
Try a number of possible answers both in your head and sometimes in
practice, even when at ﬁrst blush, only one of them really seems suitable.
.
Evaluate the pros and cons for each of your answers you consider and rank
them for their possible good results.
.
Try to rehearse some of your possible strategies and behaviors before you
actually try them out.
.
You can also achieve high frustration tolerance, that is, convince yourself
that life would be better if you solved your problems quite well, but it’s not
awful if you don’t. You can still stand it. And you can also arrange to have a
reasonably happy life when some of your important problems remain
unsolved.
According to Ellis, people who are operating rationally seek to as quickly as
possible become aware of and solve both their practical problems and
emotional problems they have about practical problems. So, Jane is rational
when she recognizes that her partner is giving her a hard time and considers
how to improve or whether to end the relationship (practical problem
solving) and while initially furious and depressed, makes herself only sad
and irritated with him (emotional problem solving) in order to best deal with
her partner.
As you attempt to solve your practical life problems, look carefully to
discover whether you have any emotional problems – such as feelings of
anxiety or depression – about these practical issues. If so, actively seek out
and actively dispute your dogmatic, musterbatory thinking that leads to
emotional difﬁculties. When working to reduce your neurotic feelings, go
back to your practical difﬁculties and use effective self-management and
problem-solving methods to tackle them.17
In terms of practical problem solving, Ellis encourages people to explore the
full range of alternatives to the problem creatively, with a particular eye on how
people can still enjoy themselves in spite of their practical problems.
For Jane, rationality means exploring different things she can say and do with
her partner, who is giving her a hard time, to get him to stop (e.g., assertion,
giving I-messages) as well as searching for those activities and experiences in-
and outside the relationship that bring her happiness despite her partner’s
difﬁcult behavior.
For Ellis, emotional problem solving also means ongoing use of his ABC-DE
model (see Chapter 3) including the disputing and changing of irrational self-
talk that leads to inappropriate, negative emotionality that makes problem
solving and decision making about whatever is that much more difﬁcult.
One of Ellis’ favorite rational sayings that help people cope and move in spite
of adversity and frustration is the Serenity Prayer he has modiﬁed to:
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
82

Grant me the courage to change those things that I can, the serenity to
accept those that I can’t, and the wisdom to know the difference.
An important aspect of this principle of rational living, then, is systematically
framing problems to be solved and preferring not requiring the solving of the
problem.
Ellis reminds everyone in our 24/7 world where we often carry multiple
responsibilities, that we need to solve the time management problem of ﬁnding
enough time to enjoy ourselves. There are different types of opportunities to be
happy that Ellis says we had better take advantage of through careful time
managementplanningincluding: (1)creativethings todoonyour ownwhen no
one else is around, (2) spending time with family and friends, (3) spending
quality time with friends, (4) sharing intimate moments and engaging in
mutually pleasurable activities, and (5) recreating through time spent on
hobbies, sport, and other fun activities.
Incorporating the principle of problem solving in your life involves you
becoming aware of and accepting problems as they inevitably present them-
selves without blaming others, yourself, or the world for their existence. You
commit yourself to dealing with the practical problem as efﬁciently as possible
and you refuse to upset yourself too much about the problem. You explore
different alternative solutions about what to do and say (and what not to do and
say),andconsiderthepositiveandnegativeconsequencesofpotentialsolutions.
You select one that seems the most advantageous and simple to implement, and
you work out the steps to take to implement the solution. During this
contemplative stage, you are alert to your levels of emotional involvement in
the problems and using scientiﬁc thinking that includes disputing irrational
self-talk as well as other coping skills, you stay cool, calm, and collected. After a
time, you make a judgment about whether the problem has been solved or
whether alternative courses of action need to be considered.
Rational Principle 11: Scientiﬁc Thinking and Flexibility
Self-actualized individuals tend to be more objective, rational, and
scientiﬁc than people who are frequently unhappy. They are able to
feel deeply and act concertedly, but they tend to regulate their emotions
and actions by reﬂecting on them and evaluating their consequences in
terms of the extent to which they lead to the attainment of their short-term
and long-term goals.5
In constructing his view of the rational mind, Ellis was enamored by the work of
the psychologist George Kelly who pointed out that people are born as natural
scientists. That is, as scientists they, for example, make predictions about what
The Philosophy of Happiness: Principles of Rational Living
83

will happen if they bring an umbrella if the forecast calls for a 50 percent chance
of rain, they observe the results of their decisions and check them to conﬁrm their
predictions.
Ellis agrees that the scientiﬁc method of setting up plausible hypotheses and
then experimenting and checking to uphold or disprove them is probably the
best (but not the only) method for discovering “truth” and understanding
“reality.” Furthermore, Ellis asserts that science is not only the use of logic and
facts to falsify a theory, science is also continually revising and changing theories
and trying to replace them with more valid ideas.
Science is ﬂexible rather than rigid, open-minded rather than dogmatic. Ellis
calls on people’s inherent capacity for scientiﬁc thinking in determining how to
go about living their lives, including the use of experimentation and self-
questioning, to reject and conﬁrm ways to think, feel, and behave.
As revealed in Chapter 3, Ellis uniquely holds that anti-scientiﬁc, irrational
thinking is a main cause of unhappiness and that if people are scientiﬁc and
ﬂexible about their desires, preferences and values, they can refuse to become
desperately unhappy. They will think: “I strongly prefer to have a great career
and loving partner,” but will not dogmatically and unscientiﬁcally insist “I must
have a great career and lover,” and when they do not, conclude “I am a totally
worthless and rotten person because I have not achieved and am not loved the
way I should be.”
And as revealed in the case transcripts that appear throughout this book, Ellis
shows people through the ABC-DEs,how to use the scientiﬁcmethodto dispute
irrational beliefs (“Where is the evidence?” “Where is it written in the universe
that you must be loved and approved of all the time?”) in order to start thinking
rationally again.
If you believe that you can beneﬁt from thinking more scientiﬁcally, persist at
using the scientiﬁc method of questioning and challenging your irrational
beliefs (e.g., “I must be successful,” “I need people to approve of me,” “This is
terrible,” “I can’t stand your behavior,” “I am a louse”) until you begin to give
them up, increase your effectiveness by solving problems, and enjoy yourself
more. You can also be more scientiﬁc by generating hypotheses about activities
and pursuits that may allow for you to become more involved and creatively
absorbed and, then, collecting evidence to determine what suits you (and what
does not).
The Rational Mindset of a Happy and Fulﬁlled Person
When Ellis speaks of rationality as a means to help people achieve their goals, he
istalkingabout theneedtoincorporaterationalprinciplesoflivingintopeople’s
overall philosophy of living that they internalize and employ on a 24/7 basis.
So, as a personal philosophy of happiness, Ellis’ rational mindset sounds to
me something like this.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
84

.
I have a right to be happy and to search for pursuits and experiences that are
pleasurable to me in the short-term and fulﬁlling in the long-term. There is
no point in waiting around for happiness to ﬁnd me.
.
While I have a right to take this journey, I will take responsibility for
ensuring that I do not cause needless harm to others in my social and family
group. In fact, by committing myself to the welfare of others, I frequently
will live a more satisfying life.
.
Now, as I am a fallible human being, when confronted by my imperfections
or people’s negative judgments of me and my behavior, I will as often as
possible choose not to put myself down but instead accept myself.
.
I will also choose not to rate people who do the wrong thing or whose
customs or behavior I dislike, and I will make a concerted effort to learn
more about them as people.
.
I know that I will be happier and more fulﬁlled when I take risks and
experiment to become involved in creative and absorbing activities. While I
will seek out short-term pleasures, I will not sacriﬁce long-term gains of
sustained commitments by becoming overly focused on immediate short-
term gratiﬁcation.
.
When I am confronted with inevitable misfortune and life’s frustrations, I
will use scientiﬁc thinking to manage my emotional responses so that I do
not rigidly obsess and demand that things be different than they are – while
trying hard to make the changes that I can, the serenity to accept those things
I cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference.
.
I will work at becoming a successful problem solver of life’s practical
problems and when problems do not go away, ﬁguring out ways that I
can still be happy. I also understand that I need to work hard at thinking
rationally about my life’s difﬁculties so that I do not become desperately
unhappy and I need to rely on my willpower to overcome inertia that can
impede my discovering those pursuits that bring me happiness.
Finally, Ellis proposes non-absolutism in people’s search for happiness.
Powerful wishes, desires, goals, purposes, and emotional attachments add
to your life and make the world go round. Passive and detached humans
may be sensible and free from much pain, but pretty damned blah. The
trick is to want to strive like all get-out, but not tothink that you absolutely
need what you want.15
He argues for a non-utopian view of the world where people accept the fact
that utopias are probably unachievable and that people are never likely to get
everything they want and to avoid all pain. For Ellis, emotionally healthy people
refuse to strive unrealistically for total joy, happiness, or perfection, or for the
total lack of anxiety, depression, and hostility.

Love
You are born and reared with a strong tendency to love and want to be
loved . . . it is part of our nature to love others.19
After a half century of both clinical and personal experience, Ellis continued to
offer many valuable insights into the nature of love, how it can be obstructed,
and its possibilities for fulﬁllment.
Ellis had been engaged in research on the subject of love since 1945, when his
ﬁrst PhD thesis proposal on the love emotions of college girls was rejected by
Columbia University because the topic was clearly related to sex. (Ellis ended up
conducting the research anyway, apart from his PhD, and published his results
in 1949 and 1950.) As a psychotherapist he dealt with problems of love almost
every day for over 60 years and through REBT has developed a unique theory
about love and its problems.
Ellis’ deﬁnition of love, which he initially articulated in his book, The
American Sexual Tragedy written in 1954, is a view he still subscribed to in
his later years:
Any kind of more or less intense emotional attraction to or involvement
with another. It includes many types and degrees of affection such as
conjugal love, paternal love, familial love, religious love, love of human-
ity, love of animals, love of things, self-love, sexual love, and obsessive-
compulsive love.1

Ellisviewedloveasnormallyagratifyingandhealthyemotionthatnotonlyhelps
to insure the survival of the human race, but also, on a personal level brings
vitality and happiness to human life.
Love Slobbism
Ellis’ views on love (and sex) have almost always been seen by some as
controversial. According to Ellis, most people mistakenly believe that they
need love to be happy, fulﬁlled, and worthwhile.
Ellis argued that while it is desirable to “love” and be loved by another
person, humans do not need love to survive. That is, people can still be happy
even when they are not in a loving relationship, for instance, when people are
single or when their relationship has terminated through separation, divorce,
or death. Rather than deﬁning their existence solely in terms of the absence of
what they “need,” Ellis showed people that they don’t need what they desire
and can, through participation in social, recreational, and work activities, be
happy and enjoy life. People who believe they must have love to survive will
tend to overly upset themselves when they are without it. It is the case that Ellis
accepted that without love and given his views concerning people’s strong
tendency to love and want to be loved, the lives of most people without a
signiﬁcant loving relationship would be less satisfying and fulﬁlling.
“Love Slobs,” the name Ellis has coined for people who believe they need love
also, frequently, deﬁne their self-worth in terms of whether someone else loves
them. “If I’m loved, I’m okay; if I’m not, I’m inferior, hopeless, and worthless.”
The attachment of rating one’s self to someone else’s love and approval is
psychologically ill advised and reckless, given the frequent uncertainty and
volatility of most loving relationships.
In the section which follows, Victoria, a 30-year-old unmarried woman who
had experienced periods of depression for a number of years, is shown by Ellis
how her need for love is not only causing her to be depressed, but also makes it
doubly hard for her to ﬁnd a suitable partner.
ELLIS:
What are you depressed about?
VICTORIA:
I guess because I feel lonely.
ELLIS:
Andyou’resaying,“Imustnotbelonely?”Areyouonyourownnow?
VICTORIA:
Yes.
ELLIS:
You won’t get depressed merely from being alone. You depress
yourself by saying, “It must not be this way. I need someone to love
and to love me!”
VICTORIA:
Uh-huh.
ELLIS:
Nobody gets depressed from not having what they want. They
depress themselves by demanding that they get what they want.
You see the difference?
VICTORIA:
Uh-huh.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
88

ELLIS:
Depression and all emotional disturbance comes from whining,
from demanding, from needing – never from just desiring. When
you desire something and you don’t get it, you can, and had better,
say “Tough shit!” When you think you need, must have something
andyoudon’tgetit,thenyou whineandscreamandmakeyourself
anxious and depressed because you ask why are you alone? What
makes you alone?
VICTORIA:
It’s one of the contradictions I’ve always had. I feel that I’m a very
social person, but in the very, very inside I feel isolated. Very few
people are capable of understanding who I am.
ELLIS:
Again I hear you saying, “And they must!” Let’s suppose very few
understand who you are. So you can keep looking, looking until
you ﬁnd one. There’s no reason anyone must understand who you
are, is there?
VICTORIA:
Yeah, yeah I guess so.
ELLIS:
Guess what?
VICTORIA:
I guess that nobody must.
ELLIS:
Now if you really believe that, you’ll immediately make yourself
undepressed. Give up all musts, all necessities, and immediately
you’ll be undepressed. Because that’s where depression comes
from – from your needing, not wanting love. You’re apparently
tellingyourself,“Iwantpeopletounderstandmeandtobewithme
and to know who I am,” which is good, because then you will push
yourself to look for them. And in New York you’d soon ﬁnd them
because there are eight million people here and among so many
there would be a number who would really understand you. But
then you’re irrationally telling yourself, “And I need what I want!
Isn’t it awful that I am not getting what I need!” Then you make
yourself depressed. It’s not because you want, you desire that
would make you keep looking. Let’s suppose you’re the kind of
person whom very few people will understand and know who you
are – let’s just suppose that. Still, you’ve got millions to choose
from, Now, why don’t you ﬁnd a few? What stops you?
VICTORIA:

ELLIS:
Well, when you’re depressed you won’t do anything. But your

VICTORIA:
I need somebody to love me.
ELLIS:
If you believe that, you make things almost hopeless. You’ll
probably be miserable for the rest of your life. If you demand
any necessities or guarantees whatsoever, you’ll tend to create
hopelessness. Do you know why?
VICTORIA:
Why?
ELLIS:
Becausetheuniverse isimpartial and doesn’t giveadamnaboutyou

of probability. Now if you tell yourself, “I want, very much, love but
if I don’t get it tough shit, so I don’t!”, then you’ll not make yourself
depressed and you’d probably ﬁnd love. That’s the irony.As soon as
yousay“Ineedit,Ineedit,Ineedit!” you’recooked.Nobodygivesa
damn whatyouneed!The universe isuncaring,totally uncaring. Do
you face that fact? It provides potential love, but just doesn’t care.
And it shouldn’t care. Because it’s just objective and indifferent. So
whenyouinsist,“Ineed!” youmean,“IneedaguaranteethatI’lllove
and somebody will love me!” Well, your need will make you
obsessed; and you will hinder your ﬁnding love, because who wants
someone who is so needy? Who needs a needy person?
VICTORIA:
Right.
ELLIS:
Suppose you met a man who is very needy, very dependent, very
depressed, because he greatly needs someone. Would you really
want him?
VICTORIA:
No.
ELLIS:
Let’s be honest now. Because you’d say to yourself “Too bad! He’s
too weak, too dependent. He needs me instead of he wants me.”
VICTORIA:
I demand so much from myself.
ELLIS:
That’s right but why do you do that? That’s right, must is another
name fordemand. Why doyoudo that? It’s crazy. You’reonly going
togetintotrouble.You’regoingtobemiserable.Whydoyoudothat?
VICTORIA:
I don’t know.
ELLIS:
Because you’re human! All humans are partly out of their minds and
often act crazily. All of them! No exceptions. They’re all, frequently,
musturbators – all demanders, all whiners, all screamers! They often
refuse to accept reality and accept the fact that there are no absolute
musts. There are no, as far as we know, no guaranteeing gods or fairy
godmothers–nomusts,noabsolutesofanykindintheuniverse.Zero.
VICTORIA:
Yeah, but conditions make a lot of musts.
ELLIS:
No they don’t. You can always ignore the condition.
VICTORIA:
I mean –
ELLIS:
Yeah? How do conditions make you say must?
VICTORIA:
For example, when you are very much a part of society and you
want to prove something.
ELLIS:
Why do you have to prove anything? Society tells you to prove that
youarecompetentandlovable,and,itmaybepreferableattimesto
do so. Why do you have to follow society? Where is it written that
you must follow its rules?
VICTORIA:
I don’t know.
ELLIS:
The answer is, You don’t have to do so! Society is often nutty.
Society tells us nutty things like, “You have to be married.” But is it
necessary to agree with society?
VICTORIA:
I have very often thought about that.
ELLIS:
But actually society doesn’t give you your musts. It gives you many
standards and desires. It says, “It’s better to be married or to be

rich.” Itdoesn’tsayyou havetobe.Youaddthemust.Yourmother
tells you, “You’d better do your homework dear.” Your father tells
you, “You’d better get a good job.” But they don’t really say you
havetodothesethings.Whentheydo,theydon’tmeanit.Theyare
speaking loosely. But you take desires and you escalate them into
musts. That’s the human condition – to escalate “It would be
betters”into absolutemusts. Somepeopledothisalittle,some doit
a lot. It’s an innate tendency to think that necessitating way. To
think crookedly much of the time!
VICTORIA:
So it’s wrong to say that I need.
ELLIS:
Need means necessity, that’s what it truly means. My whole ﬁeld,
called psychology, is inaccurate, because psychologists abuse the
wordneed. There really are nonecessities inlife. It’s verydesirableto
be loved – sometimes! It may also be a pain in the ass. But let’s
suppose it’s highly desirable. Why do you need to feel loved? Why
mustyouhaveit?Becauseit’sdesirable?That’swhateverytwo-year-
old thinks: “I want this lollypop very much. Therefore, I have to
have it!” Does the two-year-old really need the lollypop?
VICTORIA:
No, I guess not. So what do I have to do?
ELLIS:
Giveupthosefuckingmusts!Ripthemupamilliontimesuntilyou
no longer believe in any absolutes, any necessity. Work your ass off
to get what you want, but don’t deﬁne it as a necessity. The more
you want something, the more you’d better work for it. Do your
best to get it. If you want love, you plough through scores of
potential partners, discard most of them, and be discarded by
many that you prefer. Until you ﬁnd one whom you love who also
loves you. It works. It’s actually very interesting, looking and
working for what you want. Don’t tell yourself “I must have it, I
musthaveit!”Becausethenyou’llsitonyourass,notgoafterit,not
do very much. But what you desire, adds to life. So you go after
what youwantbut don’tthink youhave togetit.It’sonlydesirable,
it’s never necessary. That’s quite a difference! Humans won’t face
that difference. They say, “Because I want it very much, therefore,
ergo,Imusthaveit!”That’shorseshit.IftheMartianseverhearyou
saying that, they’ll die laughing.
VICTORIA:
That’s what usually happens when you want something really
badly. You don’t get it.
ELLIS:
Because you say, “I need it!” You don’t get it because you want it
too badly, desperately.
VICTORIA:
But what I see is that when you want something, okay, you make it
a goal.
ELLIS:
That’s ﬁne.
VICTORIA:
But then, somehow, it’s changed to a must. I don’t know how it
happens.
ELLIS:
It happens because you often think crazily. All humans do. That’s

unique reasons for nutty thinking but they’re almost always
wrong. It happens because you’re human.
VICTORIA:
We create on our own all those ideas. We create them.
ELLIS:
Yeah, none of them exists in their own right. And gods and devils
don’t make us have self-defeating musts.
VICTORIA:
Yes, but unfortunately we have been conditioned to a society
where competition drives us to accept musts.
ELLIS:
Competition says, “It’svery desirable tomakemoney,be beautiful,
or have an education.” It never really says you must. It says “It’s
very desirable,” and it is usually desirable. But not necessary!
VICTORIA:
But it leads a person deﬁnitely to make up musts.
ELLIS:
It helps you to create them. Because society consists of individuals
and individuals often think crazily. So your teachers have musts
and your parents have musts. So society encourages you to believe
in musts instead of teaching you to give them up, which if it were
wise it would do. But it doesn’t make you think in absolutes. And
some people do it much less. They’re raised in the same society but
they ﬁgure out, after a while, that “There’s no reason why I must be
loved, must have a million dollars, must be perfectly beautiful!” It
would be nice but it is not necessary. But most people, even if you
taught them that it’s not necessary to get what they want, would
still insist that it is.
Take a little child, who says, “I must have that lollypop.” And you
say “But there is no lollypop, dear, the store is closed. You don’t need
it, you can still be happy without it.” And what does the child reply,
“OhnoIcan’t,Ineedit!Imusthaveit!”Mostchildrenthinkthatway.
They’reprettynutty!Andmanychildrennevergrowup.Theyremain
two years old forever. So they continue to anger and depress
themselves. For children often make themselves depressed if we
don’t get them that lollypop. It doesn’t matter if the stores are closed
and there are no lollypops. They’ll still create anger and depression
because they naturally think screwily. You can tell them a million
times,“Youdon’tneedthelollypop,dear” andtheyreply,“ButIdo!”
SoIagreewithyouthatsocietyhelpsyouthinkcrookedlybutitdoesn’t
make you do so. You have your own self-upsetting tendencies.
Romantic Love
Ellis has written a great deal about the pleasure and pain of what has variously
been called romantic love, passionate love, intense in-lovedness, and super-
romanticlove.Ontheplusside,thereisplentyofevidencetoshowthatromantic
lovers experience extremely pleasurable and satisfying feelings and sometimes
are motivated by them to great heights of creative, artistic self-expression.
According to Ellis, someone romantically in love tends to idealize his or her
beloved, desire sexual exclusivity, experience feelings of attachment, believes that
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
92

love is eternal, want to procreate, be quite self-sacriﬁcing for his or her loved one,
and to value the love relationship as the one most important thing in the world.
The problem with romantic love is that devotees tend to subscribe to a number
ofirrationalbeliefsormythswhichcaninterferewiththeirachievingalong-lasting
loving and happy relationship and that can lead, when they don’t have it, to
emotional misery – including anxiety, depression, hostility and self-pity.
Romantic myths of our culture
1
You can passionately love one, and only one, person at a time.
2
True romantic love lasts forever.
3
Deep feelings of romantic love insure a stable and compatible
marriage.
4
Sex without romantic love is unethical and unsatisfying. Sex and
love always go together.
5
Romantic love can easily be made to develop and grow in marital
relationships.
6
Romantic love is far superior to conjugal love, friendship love,
nonsexual love, and other kinds of love, and you hardly exist if you
do not experience it intensely.
7
If you lose the person you love romantically, you must feel deeply
grieved or depressed for a long period of time and cannot legiti-
mately fall in love again until this long mourning period is over.
8
It is necessary to perceive returned love all the time to know
someone loves you.

4
If I do not experience intense romantic love, I cannot be satisﬁed
with other kinds of love feelings and will have, atmost, only a mildly
happy existence.
5
My partner must love me completely and passionately at all times or
else he or she doesn’t really love me. 16
An extreme form of super-romantic love called limerence creates all sorts of
problems if you are afﬂicted with it. The signs and symptoms of limerence,
including obsessive thinking about loved ones, an over-focusing on their
positive qualities and a denial of any negative ones; a dire need that your loved
one loves you as much as you love him or her; up and down moods depending
Love
93

on the amount of love reciprocated; and extreme anxiety feelings when love is
not returned in kind.
According to Ellis, limerence normally involves you absolutistically holding
some of the following irrational beliefs:
1
“I must have my beloved’s reciprocation or else I am an undeserv-
ing, inadequate person.”
2
“It is horrible to lose my beloved, I can’t stand it.”
3
“If my beloved does not care for me or if he or she dies, life has no
value and I might as well be dead.”
4
“My beloved is the only one in the world for me, and his or her love
alone can make me and my life worthwhile.”16
Ellis’ unorthodox views on love are revealed in the way he disputes the
irrationalbeliefsthatyoumayholdaboutlove.Headoptsanon-absoluteviewof
loving relationships and stresses that there are no right or wrong ways, good
ways or bad ways, to conduct loving relationships. The decision to love one
person or many, to be sexually exclusive or active will depend upon a number of
factors – including what “works” best for the individual and whether another
person’s emotional well-being is being compromised. In disputing the irra-
tionalities and myths which underlie super-romantic love and limerence, Ellis
presents evidence to show how it is possible to love two or more people
simultaneously, that romantic love usually fades, that deep feelings of love
not only do not insure a static and compatible relationship, but often interfere
with it, and that romantic love is not always superior to other kinds of love.
REBT activity disputes your absolute demands for romantic love. It shows that
no matter how much you prefer romantic involvements you do not have to
achieve them, and that when you do not succeed in the early stages of romance,
youarehighlyinconvenientandverysadanddeplorable,butisneitherawfulnor
terrible. You can still be a happy individual.
To help overcome obsessive-compulsive disturbances about love, Ellis
teaches you to use rational self-statements (thoughts you can repeat to yourself)
such as: “I would like to be loved as much as I love but I don’t need it to be
happy”; “It would be undesirable to lose my lover, but it wouldn’t be the end of
the world. I could stand it”; “My lover is not the only one I could care for and I
could have a worthwhile existence even if he or she did not love me.”
ThefollowingexchangebetweenEllisandStanwhohasadireneedforwomen
to love him romantically and completely illustrate how Ellis rejected society’s
convention concerning the “rightfulness” of the “marriage is forever” concept
and, instead, shows Stan how to conduct himself so that he is happy even if not
following mainstream customs. Stan is entertaining the possibility of breaking
up with a woman he has dated intimately for months.
STAN:
When I’m with a woman, why do I have to feel connected?
ELLIS:
Because you’re deﬁning a relationship as something that has to last
forever. Why does it?
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
94

STAN:
Because I say to myself. “If she leaves me, or I leave her which is even
worse – two things. One, I’m a shit because she needed me and she’ll
die without me. Two, I won’t be able to live, I’ll never be happy again!
I’ll be miserable! I wouldn’t know how to function in life.”
ELLIS:
But where’d you get that crazy notion? You’ve disproved it several
times. Your own marriage didn’t last forever.
STAN:
Right.
ELLIS:
You’ve been able to get involved again. Now, what’s the damned
horror of a relationship not lasting?
STAN:
The only horror is the feeling, with this woman, that even though I
loved before, I can’t bear losing her. And that’s horrible!
ELLIS:
Thatfeelingcomesfromanidea.Youdon’tgetafeelingwithoutanidea.
If you deﬁne something as horrible you get a feeling. So it’s always a
thought.
STAN:
I won’t be able to live on my own –
ELLIS:
Where is the evidence you are not able to live on your own?
STAN:
There isn’t any.
ELLIS:
That’s right! Now why don’t you really convince yourself that you
don’t like living on your own, but can deﬁnitely stand it. You might
like getting involved more than living on your own but you can live
alone and still be happy. You can be a happy human being, if for the
rest of your life, even if you had to live by myself. And you’re saying
you can’t.
STAN:
I do say that if I have to live by myself for the rest of my life, it’s true I
could be happy. I can be very happy, but I would be a failure at living,
I’d be a failure at life.
ELLIS:
How would you be a failure? Let’s suppose you’re the kind who
can’t ever make it permanently with a woman and you either have
short affairs or you live alone. Now how does that make you a
failure?
STAN:
I’m a failure because it’s natural for healthy and decent human beings
to be able to form long-term relationships.
ELLIS:
Statistically normal. Now why must you be a normal statistic?
STAN:
Because it’s also a moral thing, too.
ELLIS:
What’s the immorality of loving for a while and then breaking up?
STAN:
Human beings are naturally monogamous and should stay together
forever.
ELLIS:
Why the hell should they? They are naturally monogynous. Monogyny
means one at a time. But they are not monogamous which means once
in a lifetime. If they were monogamous, nobody would allow divorce.
Even Catholics now go along with divorce. So they’re not monoga-
mous, they’re monogymous. Let’s suppose you have several successful
relationships or you just live alone. Why must you be a goddamn
statistic? Why do you have to be what’s “natural” or what’s statistically
“normal?”
STAN:
Because there’s something wrong with me if I’m not.
Love
95

ELLIS:
There’s something different about you. Not wrong, different. You’re
different from the average. Now, why is that wrong? You’re fairly
bright aren’t you?
STAN:
Mmm-hmm.
ELLIS:
Isn’t that different?
STAN:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Is that terrible?
STAN:
No.
ELLIS:
Is that unfair to others that you’re bright and they’re stupid?
STAN:
No.
ELLIS:
Yes it is. It is unfair.
STAN:
I didn’t do anything.
ELLIS:
I know. But you were born fairly bright and many others weren’t.
Suppose you were born with a million dollars that would be unfair to
others. But is it horrible that that unfairness exists, that you’re bright
and others are less bright or even stupid?
STAN:
No.
ELLIS:
Then why is it horrible that you’re non-monogamous or if you live
alone?
STAN:
Because I’m a failure.
ELLIS:
You’re different. How does different equal a failure? You’re different,
we’re assuming. Not that different, because there are millions like you.
Themajorityof peoplestay married,mated, for20ormore years.They
maynotbemarriedtoohappily,buttheystay.Let’ssupposeyoudon’t.
Now how the devil does that make you bad?
STAN:
It occurs to me that I don’t have the right to choose this way of living
for myself.
ELLIS:
Why? Where is the evidence that you don’t?
STAN:
Because it goes against everything I was ever taught. It goes against
what my mother would want, what my father would want, what my
brother and sister would want, what the Catholic Church wants, what
society wants, what God wants.
ELLIS:
SupposeyouweretaughttovoteforaconservativeRepublican,doyou
have to?
STAN:
No. I could unlearn that quick.
ELLIS:
All right. Then why can’t you unlearn that what God and society
presumably want is not what you want, or have to want? Tough shit!
You’re different. You’re not a good Catholic now, you got a divorce.
STAN:
Righto, I’m an atheist now.
ELLIS:
Well, you’re not really an atheist.
STAN:
Well, I’ve got an answer to that. Because I don’t believe in God but I do
believe in religious practices.
ELLIS:
Butyoubelieveinabsolutes:thatthere’sanabsolutelawoftheuniverse
thatcommandsthatamanshouldstaymatedtoawoman.Andatheists
presumably do not believe in absolutes.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
96

STAN:
That’s what I feel. And I feel that I’m a failure because I didn’t make it
in marriage. And I have no right to have a good life again and love
anyone else.
ELLIS:
But the belief that there’s an absolute law is a theological idea. And
the term “a failure” really means a complete sinner, a louse, a devil.
No human is a failure. People fail much of the time but they’re not
total, global failures. It’s a theological notion that if they fail they are
shits and only deserve to keep failing. And a shit is really a devil. You
still believe in the devil even though you don’t believe in God. You’d
really better give up that horseshit!
STAN:
And the only possible way to make up for my sin of divorce is to marry
someone else and stay married forever. And I still don’t want to do
that. So I don’t go near anybody.
ELLIS:
With that nutty belief, you’ll be extremely upset in case a relationship
doesn’t work out. Suppose you marry again but don’t stay married
forever. Then you’re a double shit! The reason people invent an all-
powerful god is because they think in absolutes. An illustration I often
give people is: “Suppose you believe right now there is a red devil, an
invisible red devil, standing behind you; and he is going to jab you up
the ass with a pitchfork every time you make a mistake. How would
you feel?”
STAN:
Nervous.
ELLIS:
You’d be off the wall! But you’ve invented a red devil. None exists. But
you’ve invented a red devil who is going to jab you with a pitchfork for
every error. And the red devil is you. There is no red devil. You see?
You’ve re-invented it, in special instances. In this area, you’ve in-
vented, “I must love and love forever and never hurt a woman and
never be unfaithful in any way. Else I’m a no-goodnik!”
STAN:
Right.
ELLIS:
But that’snotyou. You’renot ano-goodnik! Youareahumanwhocan
love; and most of the time you love for a while and then it goes. But
that’s the norm, you know. People who stay married are not madly in
love with their mates. And many of them love other people more than
their mates but they just remain married.
STAN:
There’s something about the notion that love can’t last forever, that’s
upsetting to me.
ELLIS:
Well, did I tell you about the book of Henry T. Fink. He wrote a book
called Romantic Love and Personal Beauty. Two volumes. He combed
all the literature, ﬁction and nonﬁction, drama, poems, etcetera, up to
that date. He did a very good job. And he found out that when you live
together with your mate, in-lovedness never lasts more than three
years. If you don’t live together, if you live apart, or see each other
sporadically or have other non-domestic arrangements, romantic love
can last longer. It doesn’t usually, but it can.
STAN:
Mine lasted one month, seven days, a week.
Love
97

ELLIS:
Well that’s the point. I’ve been in love with one woman for only two
weeks. I’ve been passionately in love with another one for four years
but I didn’t live with her.
STAN:
Doesn’t that scare you about life?
ELLIS:
No, why should it scare me? Why do I have to frighten myself? As a
matter of fact I’m delighted because I know that I could fall in love
again.
STAN:
Right. And another thing, unless I have the undivided attention of the
woman I’m involved with I think I’m a shit. And I don’t deserve to be
happy or to enjoy myself.
ELLIS:
Right. That’s what you think!
STAN:
That’s exactly it.
ELLIS:
Thoseareconditionsyousetupforenjoyingyourselfandbeinghappy.
STAN:
And I think the corollary is if I enjoy myself despite the fact she doesn’t
show me love and attention, then I’m a callous, horrible, and insensi-
tive person and I don’t deserve a loving relationship.
ELLIS:
But suppose there were a runner and he said, “I have to win every race
that I ever run or else I’m shit.” What would you think of that notion?
You’d say right away that he’s crazy. Even if he says, “I have to be the
best runner in the world!” He’s still nutty. If he says, “I have to win
every race all the time as long as I live,” he’s really disturbed! How
could he possibly do that? That’s what would happen. Practically
everybody who has that idea would give up running.
STAN:
That’s what I’m tempted to do, give up the race with women.
ELLIS:
And with your nutty, grandiose notion that a woman must love you
100 percent of the time, forever and ever, you might as well go join a
monastery. It’s crazy!
STAN:
It is. But then I think, “What have you got? Thirty, thirty-ﬁve years of
living, left. This is it. Nobody is going to remember you. The only
smart thing to do in life is to have a good time. Anything else that
doesn’t include that is crazy.”
ELLIS:
That’s what you lightly believe. But you strongly believe “I have to
ascend to heaven and be special in the eyes of this woman I care for
right now. She must think greatly and nobly of me all the time! If she
thinks anything else, it’s terrible! And if she looks at another man I’m a
total shit.” Then you get insensately jealous. You think that you
absolutely have to control her, you have to have 100 percent control
over her. Well, lots of luck!
Jealousy and Possessiveness
Jealousyis anall toofamiliarand, frequently,destructive human emotion which
can interfere with your happiness and love relationship. Ellis distinguishes
between two types of jealousy: rational and irrational. According to Ellis, when
peoplearerationallyjealous,theydesireyourloverelationshiptocontinue,tobe

98

exclusive, and you are concerned about your lover being involved with someone
else (paying too much attention to, having sex with) that could threaten you
with thelossof therelationship.Oneimportantpoint Ellismakesisthatjealousy
is rational and non-self-defeating (and normal) if people feel concerned,
frustrated, and disappointed if their loved one is involved with another.
Irrationaljealousy,whichisaformofextremeupsetanddisturbance,involves
people demanding that their loved one exclusively loves them and includes
horror at the idea of them becoming emotionally or sexually intimate with
another and, perhaps, leaving that person. Feelings of anxiety, hostility, or
depression, which stem from irrational jealousy and from obsessive rumination
about losing a loved one, are destructive to people’s emotional well-being and
often to the relationship itself.
As you would predict, Ellis locates the main cause of irrational jealousy in the
irrational thinking and beliefs of the jealous party, and not in the actions of his or
her beloved. Some of the main irrational beliefs of extremely jealous people are: “I
must have a guarantee that you strongly love only me, and will continue to do so
indeﬁnitely.”“IfyoudonotlovemeasIloveyou,theremustbesomethingradically
wrong with me, and I hardly deserve your affection!” “Because I love you entirely
and keep being devoted to you, you have to always return my love, will cause me
greatsufferingifyoudon’t,andarethenarotten,damnableperson!”“UnlessIhave
the absolute certainty that you adore me and always will, my life will be too
disorganized and unpleasant, and it hardly seems worthwhile going on with it.”
REBT shows people how to recognize and change their irrational beliefs in
order to arrive at some rational and realistic views toward the person they love,
including, “I would like very much for you to care for me as I care for you, but
there is no reason you have to do so. I can still be happy, though not nearly as
happy, if you don’t.” “You may well be the best love partner I am likely to ﬁnd
during my lifetime and I therefore highly value your love and companionship.
But if I somehow lose you, I can deﬁnitely love others and achieve a satisfying
loving relationship with someone.” “Although I love you dearly and am quite
willing to devote myself to you, my love does not oblige you to love me in return
or to restrict yourself for me. You have a perfect right to your own feelings and
behaviors regarding me and, since I cannot make you change them, I will try to
accept this as best I can and still keep loving you.” “If you lie to me or otherwise
contradict the feelings of love you say you have for me and betray our
relationship I shall consider your behavior unloving and untrustworthy but
I shall not damn you as a person acting in this undesirable manner.” Changes in
therationalthinkingofajealouspersonresultsinasigniﬁcantdiminution ofnot
only jealousy but the related feelings of hostility, anxiety, and self-pity.
In addition to getting people to give up their irrational beliefs underlying
jealousy, REBT provides several other methods which also help overcome
morbid jealous feelings including: (1) making a list of the advantages of having
possibly open relationships, such as the alleviation of monotony and boredom.
A greater variety of sex and love experiences, more satisfaction when the two
mates are apart and the compensation for the sex and love deprivation of one
mate who may have higher libidinous drives than the other; (2) Showing jealous

lovers how to set a speciﬁc time limit to allow themselves to indulge in jealous
thoughts; (3) Showing people how to use rational-emotive imagery – see how to
feel less jealous.
Inthesession whichfollows,Ellisdiscussesacouple’sconcernsaboutjealousy
and going out with other partners. In particular, Ellis shows Hank how his
jealousy can be diminished through rationally thinking that he can stand it if
Wendy goes out with another and that he need not put himself down as inferior
if he loses Wendy to another.
ELLIS:
What do both of you want to discuss most?
WENDY:
I feel we need to talk about each of us going out with other people.
ELLIS:
All right. So you both want to go out with other people? Is that right?
WENDY:
Yes.
HANK:
I suppose in a way we both do.
ELLIS:
Are you jealous if she goes out?
HANK:
Yes, I guess I have some difﬁculties in dealing with that.
ELLIS:
Because you’re afraid of what?
HANK:
I guess, of her falling in love with someone else.
ELLIS:
All right. Let’s suppose the worst that she does. That would be a pain
in the ass, but why would it be so awful?
HANK:
I guess I feel I would be losing a lot if I lost her.
ELLIS:
That would be really painful. But would it mean you’re a shit?
HANK:
Would it what?
ELLIS:
Would it mean you’re a shit?
HANK:
Yeah, I would feel that way. That there was competition with
whoever it was, and I would feel I lost.
ELLIS:
He would be preferred in some respects to you by her. How would
that make him a better human?
HANK:
Well, he’d have Wendy. I wouldn’t.
ELLIS:
So it would make him more fortunate; he would have the good
fortune to have her. How would that make him a better human?
HANK:
I guess not a better human, but I would be very envious of him.
ELLIS:
But, again, it would be quite unfortunate. He would have her. But
why would you have to put yourself down?
HANK:
Uh-huh. Well, I guess I would think that I could have done
something to avoid that.
ELLIS:
Maybe there was something you could have done. So you made a
mistake. Now why aren’t you allowed to make errors? That’s why
you feel inadequate. You have little conﬁdence because you’re
demanding that you never make mistakes.
HANK:
That’s very true. Yeah, I don’t like myself a lot of the time because of
that.
ELLIS:
As long as you demand that you not make errors, you’re going to be
in trouble. So your problem is to try to make fewer errors and try to
win her or any other person you favor. But if you don’t, it’s not the
end of the world!And you’re nota shit! As you may know, insecurity

or insensate jealousy stems mainly from self-downing: “I’m a shit
if I lose her!” It also stems from low frustration tolerance: “I can’t
bear it if I lose her!” That would be most unfortunate, as we said
before, but you could bear it.
HANK:
Uh-huh.WhenI’mjealous,Ithinkofsomeonebeingbetterthanme.
ELLIS:
It makes them preferred to you, maybe. But Wendy actually might
have poor taste! She might take some schnook and prefer the
schnook to you. Does that mean anything about you?
HANK:
I don’t look at it that way.
ELLIS:
I know but why do you look at it negatively when it doesn’t
necessarily mean that she disfavors you?
HANK:
Yeah,I knowwhat you’re saying.I alwaysberate myself. Ithink thatI
could have done this or that better. And I put myself down.
ELLIS:
You see, that proves what I said before. You’re trying to measure up
to some ideal standard and saying, “I’m a shit when I don’t!” You’re
not goingtobeideal. Noneofusis;andyou’re sayingthatyou haveto
be. Well, that’s not going to work!
HANK:
Right, I should be more accepting or something?
ELLIS:

let’s suppose you were nasty to Wendy and therefore she left you for
someotherguy–let’sjustsupposethat.Well,you’dbetternotignore
the fact that you did wrong. You’d better say, “That was bad,” but
never “I am a bad person.”
HANK:
Okay, that means the thing I do is bad, but it doesn’t mean I’m bad.
ELLIS:
Right! You are not your behavior. You don’t equal any behavior. You
don’t equal anything you ever do because you’re an ongoing process.
You’resaying“IammybehaviorwhenIscrewup.”Nowthat’suntrue.
HANK:
I do get upset by judging myself by what I do.
ELLIS:
Yeah, right. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to accomplish
more. You’d better, if you lost Wendy, try to win her back. Or try to
get somebody equivalent. Don’t try to prove yourself but to enjoy
yourself. The object of being with Wendy is love to enjoy her, not to
prove how good you are. As soon as you get insensately jealous, you
really slip over to trying to prove yourself. You never have to prove
yourself. Wendy, what bothers you most?
WENDY:
I think this whole thing about going out with other people. We have
been going together for over two years. During that time, he was
going out with others.
ELLIS:
He was going out and you weren’t? Is that what you’re saying?
WENDY:
Well, he started dating someone else where he went to school, and
they got more involved with each other. And I found that extremely
difﬁcult to deal with. I think I’m still feeling very angry about it all.
ELLIS:
Because you’re saying “That sonofabitch shouldn’t have done that?”
WENDY:
Yes.
ELLIS:
But he should have. Do you know why he should have?
WENDY:
Why?

And when you’re angry you’re really putting him down aren’t you?
WENDY:
I guess I feel that way.
ELLIS:
Yeah, but that’s wrong, not wrong to be annoyed because of what he
does. Actually, you can give him an ultimatum and say, “Look, dear,
you do that and I’m not going to go with you.” But you seem to be
hanging on to your anger. And is that why you want to go out with
others now, because of your anger?
WENDY:
Ithinkthat’salotofit.BeforeHankdecidedtodateothersIhadbeen
feeling, I had this feeling, of wanting to have asexual experience with
another. But I think that when he was going out with this other
person, I was feelingvery unhappy about it and thoughtI had to take
care of myself. And if it meant enjoying other people, I would do
that. And it sort of pushed me to start.
ELLIS:
Yeah. So it’s okay to take care of yourself but not to think that you
havetogetbackathim.Ifyoureallywanttogetmoreexperiencesand
he’s getting more too, there is no reason why you shouldn’t do that.
But try to do it for the right reason – not to do him in, not because
he’s a bastard, but because you really want to do it.
HANK:
I guess I see difﬁculty in maintaining a relationship through each of
us having sex with another.
ELLIS:
Difﬁculty, if she had other sex – ?
HANK:
And I had other sex.
ELLIS:
Why would it be so difﬁcult? Why couldn’t you tentatively try it.
HANK:
It’s interesting. It might not be so hard. But I have the fear of the two
of us drawing away from each other because of seeing other people.
ELLIS:
It could happen. But you’ll never know if itwill happen,until you try
it.You’llneverknowwithcertainty.Youmayneverknowhowmuch
you care for each other until you have some comparisons. If you
both go with other people it may have one advantage. It does have
disadvantages, but one advantage is that you may ﬁnd out what you
really mean to each other.
HANK:
Uh-huh.
ELLIS:
Theveryworstthatcouldhappen,again,wouldbethatyoubreakup,
and that would hardly be the end of the world. You both are
obviously young and attractive and you’ll have little problem in
ﬁnding other people. It might be good if you broke up because you
found someone better, because it might mean you’re not really born
for each other. You see, you don’t know. There is no evidence that
going with others will break you up. But if it did, so be it. If so, you’d
better always see the bottom line: It’s never the end of the world.

Whatever happens, happens. Face it and feel sad and sorrowful but
not down, not like a worm, awful!
HANK:
I’d really hate losing contact with her.
ELLIS:
But you haven’t lost her yet and there’s no evidence that you will. If
you did, then you could make an effort later to track her down and
see if she’s still available.
HANK:
But I’d feel hopeless, that I shouldn’t have lost her.
ELLIS:

the doubt, that uncertainty, that you may have been wrong. But
there is no certainty. You’d better accept that.

ELLIS:
How could you know? You put down on your form that you’re

You’d better explore that!
Keeping Love Alive
Given Ellis’concernwithboth thealleviation ofhumanmiseryandabetting self-
actualization and happiness, he devised a number of methods for creating and
enhancing feelings of love and keeping these feelings alive once they have
developed and are reviewed in a chapter (“Love and Its Problems”) of a book we
co-edited Clinical Applications of Rational Emotive Therapy.
1
Let your expectations be optimistic but do not let them run riot. Assume
that you can steadily and continuously but not always and ecstatically
love.
2
Although you may spontaneously love or fall violently in love, realize that the
continuation of your passions frequently requires unspontaneous work.
3
Ask yourself, “What do I ﬁnd and can I continue to ﬁnd lovable about my
partner? What are this partner’s good traits that I can focus on? What are the
things I can enjoy with him or her? What loving thoughts can I have and what
caring things can I do for my beloved?”
4
Practice loving feelings. Remember and imagine situations that make you feel
affectionate, caring, tender, ardent, and desirous.
5
Deliberately act in loving ways to your beloved. Send ﬂowers, buy gifts, write
poems, say loving words, tell others how much you care. No matter how
difﬁcult you ﬁnd saying “I love you,” say it! Again and again!
Love
103

6
Plan and carry out mutually enjoyable pursuits with your beloved such as
reading aloud together, engaging in sports, attending movies and plays,
visiting friends, having sex, and camping out.
7
Ifyoumainlydesireyourbelovedtothink,act,orfeeldifferently,trytoexpress
your desire preferentially and unhostilely and mainly encourage him or her to
fulﬁll it. If you cannot arrange this kind of fulﬁllment, work at accepting your
frustration and refrain from making too much of it.
8
Consideration is not the same as loving but it certainly helps. If you go out of
your way to discover what your beloved likes and to abet these preferences,
and if you especially go out of your way to discover what your beloved dislikes
orhatesandtoavoiddoingthosethings,youwillgoalongwaytowardkeeping
his or her love for you alive.
9
Do not be compulsively honest about everything! Silence is often golden,
especially when your partner keeps doing irritating things that you will put up
with.Butifheorshedoes somethingthatisagainstyour basicgoalsandvalues
and that can be changed – then speak up.
10
Franklyacknowledgeyourownandyourpartner’ssexdesiresandproclivities,
recognizing that sex does not equal intercourse but includes many non-coital
enjoyments, and in collaboration with your mate arrange for you both to
achieve regular sex satisfaction.
11
Bewithand sharewithyour partner toa considerabledegree,but try toarrange
that you both also maintain appreciable individuality and personal identity.
12
Make consistent efforts to communicate well with your beloved. Actively
listen to your partner making sure you understand each other’s views before
disagreeing with them.11
One of Ellis’ most profound insights into how to love and be loved by another
person is for you to be committed, ﬁrst, to accepting, loving, and caring for
yourself.Onceyoulearnhowtoacceptyourselfwithallyour blemishes,thenitis
more possible to accept and love another with all of theirs.
Most of all, perhaps, Ellis counsels people to keep a good sense of humor and
to reduce their overly absurd, serious, and exaggerated ideas about their loved
ones’ obviously frustrating behavior to absurdity. The following excerpt from
one of Ellis’ humorous songs was designed to combat love slobbism.
Love Me, Love Me, Only Me! (To the tune of Yankee Doodle)12
Love me, love me, only me, Or I’ll die without you!
Make your love a guarantee, so I can never doubt you!
Love me, love me totally; really, really try, dear;
But if you demand love, too, I’ll hate you till I die, dear;
Love me, love me all the time, thoroughly and wholly;
Life turns into slushy slime less you love me solely!
Love me with great tenderness, with no ifs or buts, dear!
For if you love me somewhat less I’ll hate your goddamned guts, dear!

Relationships
Youwill be more self-actualizing (and happy) if you makeyourself distinctly
“attached” (involved) and “non-attached” (not desperately involved).5
Ellis employs REBT to help couples to enjoy themselves more and not be
disturbed about money and realities of work by showing them how to accept the
“grim realities” of work and income, while not being too pessimistic and not
cavalierly running away from them. Thus, if couples still believe in the great
myths of rugged individualism and a chicken in every pot, they can be shown
that today’s world often mandates both partners working, sharing responsibili-
ties of child rearing and paying bills. There is less time for being intimate and
leisurely (practical problems).
Overtheyears,Ellishasprovidedinvaluableinsightsintoproblemsassociated
with the three different stages of relationships: dating, mating, and separating.
Encountering Suitable Partners
Shyness is just a high class name for shithood. (Ellis public lecture)
There are literally millions of single males and females who rarely or never enjoy
enduring intimacy. The upsets experienced by people searching for long-term,
high-level partners are, perhaps, the next common of all human problems.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness: The Legacy of Albert Ellis
 Michael E. Bernard
Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Ellis has identiﬁed three main obstacles to encountering suitable love
partners: social anxiety (unassertiveness, fear of rejection), hostility (anger),
and procrastination (low frustration tolerance).
Let’s look at each of these blocks – leaving the most common one, anxiety,
until last – and see how Ellis has come to analyze them in terms of the irrational
beliefs you hold about yourself, others, and the world.
Procrastination
Some people who have a long history of searching for the right mate ﬁnd
themselves becoming increasingly frustrated and begin to decrease their efforts
or procrastinate in making attempts to ﬁnd a partner. They stop going out, do
not ask friends for “leads” on potential partners, and, even when they are
out, do not assert themselves in situations which might result in meeting new
people.
Thisgroup differsfrom another largegroup ofsingle people whoeventhough
they have been frustrated in their search for a loving relationship, enthusiasti-
cally continue to pursue their goal of achieving long-term intimacy.
According to Ellis, if people have become frustrated and inactive, they are
acting in self-defeating ways (they’re less likely to ﬁnd a loved one by sitting at
home) because they tend to irrationally believe that (1) “It is awful that it is so
hard to ﬁnd someone”; (2) “I can’t stand it when dating is so difﬁcult”; (3) “My
world is rotten for making dating so hard for me and for putting real blocks in
my way”; and (4) “Conditions in my life should be arranged so that I meet
potential lovers fairly easily.”
If people subscribe to these ideas, they are upsetting themselves unnecessarily
about the difﬁculties of ﬁnding a suitable partner and, unless they become less
frustrated, will continue to procrastinate and be alone.
Ellis shows would-be lovers how their frustration is leading them to procras-
tinate and actively disputes with them their irrational beliefs about the difﬁcul-
ties of dating. It teaches people how to challenge and dispute these frustration-
creating ideas by asking themselves to provide evidence to support their
irrational assumptions and conclusions. Speciﬁcally, it shows that there is no
evidence that dating should be easy and, in fact, the evidence suggests that it is
one of life’s most difﬁcult enterprises.
Once people give up their demand that dating must be easy and accept that it
isn’t – although it certainly would be preferable if it were – they will no longer be
as frustrated when they encounter difﬁculties.
Ellis gets peopleto ask themselves,“Where is the evidence that it isawful and I
can’t stand it when things are not going my way and I don’t seem to be getting
anywhere?” He shows them that it is only a hassle, disappointing and irritating,
but not a horror, and certainly is something they can stand. REBT also helps
people to stop blaming and condemning their lives and the world for making
things so hard and shows them that just because their dating has not lead to
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
106

success in the past, it does not mean that the whole dating scene is rotten, nor
does it mean they won’t be successful in the future.
There is plenty of evidence that people vary agreat deal in howmanyattempts
and relationships it takes for them to ﬁnd someone who they can happily and
satisfactorilylivewith.Thelikelihoodofﬁndingasuitablepartnerincreaseswith
effort, and reduces to near zero if you do not. Ellis’ counsel in this matter could
be summed up by saying that rather than whining about how hard it is to date,
“do” rather than “stew”! And do, do, do, until you achieve what you want.
Hostility
Anger is not only one of the greatest causes of relationship breakdowns, it also is
adeﬁnite impediment to successfuldating. Ellis strongly believes that because of
its potentially destructive effects on the person to whom it is directed, anger in
relationships is self-defeating.
Inthedatingarena,angerorrageusuallyrearsitsuglyheadwhenapersonyou
are dating seemingly treats you in an unfair, inconsiderate, irresponsible, and
unloving way. For example, someone you are dating criticizes you unfairly,
cancels a date at the last moment, goes out with another person, or worst of all –
especially if you are attracted to the person – elects to stop dating you. Now, it is
quite rational to become irritated towards the person at these times. However,
getting furious towards partners for their unfairness and hostile towards all
males or females because of your date’s behavior is deﬁnitely self-defeating.
If the person you’re dating has a number of appealing qualities, which attract
you, but you get so angry that either you or your date elects to discontinue
dating, then you are the loser. If because of one or more unsuccessful dating
relationships in the past where you ended up being treated unfairly you become
suspicious and hostile towards subsequent dates, you are also doing yourself in.
The rational approach to unfairness and inconsideration in dating is one that
accepts unfairness and inconsideration as an undesirable though often
“normal” part of all relationships because of the nature of human beings.
That is, human beings because they are fallible, mistake-makers will sometimes
act in unfair, selﬁsh ways. To remain rational under these set of inevitable
irrational circumstances, you had better accept this fact without demanding,
“The partners I select must at all times under all conditions be fair, considerate,
and loving to me and they are rotten people if they aren’t!”
Now, Ellis does not say that fairness, consideration, and care are unimportant
qualities to value and look for. On the contrary, these qualities do matter. But
when a date acts contrary to these values, Armageddon is not at hand, and he or
she is not totally hopeless and deserving of being roasted in hell because of not
living up to your expectations. You may make a rational choice not to continue
dating someone who acts unfairly too often. However, you had better make this
decisionintermsoftheoverallcharacteristicsandbehaviorofpartnersandwhat
they offer and not just in terms of their “unacceptable” behavior. To sum up:
Relationships
107

“While it is certainly preferable that people treat me well, there is no law of the
universe that says they must, and I’d better work hard at accepting them even
when I strongly dislike their behavior.”
Social anxiety
Ellis identiﬁes anxiety as the main block to encountering suitable love partners.
Cutting away all the peripheral reasons for shyness, unassertiveness and
difﬁculties in social situations, Ellis has found at the core of people’s shyness
is an over-preoccupation with what others may think of them. This over-
preoccupation leads to great anxiety and discomfort, which makes it almost
impossible for people to participate in social situations and if and when they do
they are so uptight that they function poorly. This over-preoccupation with
other people’s judgments isanotherwayof stating thatmanypeople haveagreat
fear of rejection.
As these people anticipate approaching a social situation, like a party or
talking to someone they know a little or not at all, or asking someone out on a
date, their thoughts are dominated by, “What will they think of me?” “What if
they won’t want to talk to me, that would really prove I’m hopeless!” “What if I
make a fool of myself?” “What if they tell me that they’re not interested, that
would make me inferior!” “What if I’m not witty or don’t have anything to say?”
As you might expect, these thoughts lead to such intense anxiety that many ﬁnd
it much more pleasant and easy to avoid rather than face social situations.
You might wonder why people are so concerned about how other people will
react to them and think about them. According to Ellis, people literally create
their own anxiety because they profoundly hold the irrational belief that “I must
win the approval of all the highly desirable people I meet, and I’m pretty
worthless if I don’t.”
Ellis helps people to reduce their social anxiety by getting them to imagine the
worst scenario possible. He invites socially anxious people to imagine them-
selves approaching someone they desire to meet and go out with and being
rejected.Atthispointheshowspeoplethatitishardlyhorribleorawfuliftheyare
rejected (only unfortunate), that they can stand being rejected even though they
do not like it, and that their worth as a person does not decrease when they are
rebuffed.Themorerationalattitudetowardswinningtheapprovalofothersand
being rejected in dating situations is thatwhileit is desirableto be liked by others
because one is generally happier when one is, it does not follow that one is
hopeless, unlovable, and doomed to unhappiness when one is rejected.
While Ellis’ main approach to social anxiety is in helping people to identify
and rip up their irrational beliefs about rejection and replace them with more
rational ones, he also employs other thinking, feeling, and behavioral methods
discussed in Chapter 3 to help people change their thoughts about rejection, to
decrease their feelings of shyness and anxiety, and to risk refusal by actively
pursuing social contacts.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness

Some of the more popular and effective methods and techniques which Ellis
has developed or helped popularize include:
1
Getting you to make a list of all the advantages of taking risks and
getting probably many rejections while doing so, and all the dis-
advantages of comfortably refusing to take such risks and waiting for
another to approach you.
2
Helping to locate information about the best places to meet people
(museums, concert intermissions, libraries, art galleries) and getting
you to agree to encounter potential partners at least few times a week
until you are able to tolerate rejection.
3
Saying to yourself vigorously and forcefully rational statements,
such as “I can stand rejection even though I don’t like it!”
“Rejection doesn’t mean I’m a reject!” “It’s better to have tried
and lost than never to have tried at all!”
4
Showing how to use rational-emotive imagery by imagining yourself
failing miserably at encountering others and only feeling regretful,
frustrated and annoyed, and not depressed.
5
Doing shame-attacking exercises which involve deliberately doing
something you consider foolish or shameful, such as wearing out-
landish clothes or saying something stupid, and showing you how to
feel unashamed and accepting when you do so.
6
Recommending reading matter on RET, assertiveness, communica-
tion and other subjects related to dating, such as Ellis’ The Intelligent
Woman’s Guide to Dating and Mating and Sex and the Liberated Man.
In the following session, Ellis disputes with Barry his irrationalities underly-
ing his shyness.
ELLIS:
And do you go with women now?
BARRY:
I go with women, but it’s hard for me to open up. I mean, ask for a
date.
ELLIS:
Because you’re afraid of rejection?
BARRY:
I really don’t know what it is.
ELLIS:
What else would it be?
BARRY:
I think that’s a good possibility.
ELLIS:
That’s what almost everybody else is afraid of.
BARRY:
Yeah, I’m scared of being turned down.
ELLIS:
Because if you were turned down, what would that mean to you?
What would you tell yourself about being turned down?
BARRY:
It’s very hard for me to talk to a woman.
ELLIS:
Because if I do what?
BARRY:
Well if I was turned down I would feel maybe there’s something
wrong with me.
ELLIS:
But how would that prove that there was? We all get turned down.
Relationships
109

BARRY:
Right.
ELLIS:
All right, why don’t the rest of us think there’s something wrong with
us?
BARRY:
I don’t know they just –
ELLIS:
Well, because we say “Tough shit, so I got turned down!” You see,
you’re taking possible rejection too seriously. You see what I mean?
You’re not saying –
BARRY:
I mean, when I get turned down, it’s like a kick in the ass. I mean, it
really hurts, I mean, I go home and cry, you know it’s –
ELLIS:
Because what are you telling yourself?
BARRY:
I guess I tell myself something’s wrong with me. I don’t look right or I
didn’t come out speaking right.
ELLIS:
Correct. Butwhyisthatsoterrible.Let’ssupposeyoufuckupandyou
don’t speak right, why is that so terrible? What happens, does the
earth stop spinning?
BARRY:
No, but –
ELLIS:
Yeah?
BARRY:
You know, like if I come on nice to a person, I feel, “At least, give me a
reason. Just don’t say ‘No’.”
ELLIS:
But suppose you come on badly, as lots of us do.
BARRY:
I don’t, I treat a woman like a gentleman would.
ELLIS:
Yeah, but suppose you fuck it up with her and she doesn’t like you.
Why is that so awful?
BARRY:
I don’t know.
ELLIS:
Do you think your father was ever turned down by women?
BARRY:
Yeah, I guess –
ELLIS:
Did he survive? How come? How come he’s still alive and kicking?
BARRY:
Yeah, but it’s so hard for me to ask for a date.
ELLIS:
Because you’re saying, “I’m a shit if she turns me down!” That’s what
you’re telling yourself. You see, that’s where shyness comes from.
You’re putting yourselfdown. You’resaying,“I havetodowellorelse
I’mashit!”Insteadof,“I’dliketodowellbutifIdon’t,Idon’t!Fuckit!
Too damn bad! So I’ll try somebody else.” You’re shaking your head
afﬁrmatively. But the problem is to help you to really believe that.
You’re anxious most of the time, aren’t you?
BARRY:
Yes.
ELLIS:
You’re not saying, “I’d like them to accept me, but if I don’t get them
to, tough shit, too bad!” You’re saying, “I got tohave them accept me.
I’ve got to! They must accept me or else I’m a shit!”
BARRY:
Everyone has to say yes to me.
ELLIS:
That’s right, and you’re going to be shy and unassertive with that
view. That’s where your shyness comes from. Now let’s help you to
changeyourmustintoapreference,“IwishIhadwonthatwoman,but
if I don’t get her approval, I don’t! Too fucking bad, so I don’t!” Then
you’ll get rid of your shyness. You’re scared shitless of going out there
in the world and asking for what you want and doing what you want,
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness

and if you fail, you fail! We all fail. Your father’s failed, I’ve failed lots
of times. But we get by, we say, “Shit, so we’ve failed! Too bad! Now
what do we do next time to try to succeed?” See?
BARRY:
Yes.
ELLIS:
So look at your philosophy of must. “I must succeed, I must get
people’s approval, I must do well!” That’s going to block you; and if
youseethatandchangeit,thenyou’llgooutthereandtalktowomen,
go for new jobs, and try almost anything else you want to do in life.
And when you fail, you fail. You know how many times Edison tried
for the electric bulb. Do you know how many times he tried new
ﬁlaments? Seven hundred and ninety-nine times.
BARRY:
Really?
ELLIS:
Yeah, till he ﬁnally found it. And he failed to invent the movie, which
he vainly tried for and failed with many other inventions too.
BARRY:
But he pursued it.
ELLIS:
Yes, he persisted.
BARRY:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
Edison said, “Genius is nine-tenth perspiration and one-tenth in-
spiration!”Sohepursued,yousee.Hedidn’tgiveashit,nottoomuch
of a whit when he failed. Now if we can get you to pursue what you go
after and you fail, and fail, and fail, you’ll then get accepted. You can
try enough women until you get accepted. But not if you say, “I’ve got
to! I must! I have to succeed!” Then you’re cooked – you’ll cook
yourself. So if you takerisks and do things, you’ll get along well in life.
But if you fail, too bad, tough shit, so you fail! The earth doesn’t open
up and swallow you. You fail many times, but you’re still alive. Just
like your father, who failed more times than you, probably, and he’s
still there. And I’m sure your mother and your brother also often fall
on their faces, don’t they? They’re not perfect.
BARRY:
Nobody’s perfect.
ELLIS:
But you have to be perfect! Lots of luck! I’m afraid that you’re not
going to make it. So if we get you over that nutty idea that you have to
do perfectly well at all times with women, with jobs, with anything,
you’lldobetter.Youcansay,“I’dliketodowell”–forwe’renottrying
to change your goals or your values. “I’d like to, but if I don’t, I don’t,
tough! So I’ll try again!” If at once you don’t succeed, try, try again.
You see?
BARRY:
Right.
Mating
To be happy, you have to realize that hard work is a permanent ongoing
process – a way of life. As a human, you have to get organized, and then,
stay organized, which calls for ongoing problem solving. Here are three
steps to take.
Relationships
111

Step 1: couples have to organize themselves; otherwise, they cannot
cope
Step 2: work at staying organized; requires ongoing problem solving;
doing the work or staying organized (cleaning, shopping, ironing)
Step 3: work on enjoyment: discover and experience . . . enjoy the work

Since 1961, when he wrote A Guide to Successful Marriage (with Robert Harper),
Ellis and REBT have offered a unique and illuminating view of marriage and its
problems. Over the years, many of the books written on the subject have focused
on the elements of a “good” relationship. Ellis, however, has always maintained
that it is quite difﬁcult to specify the characteristics of a good relationship and,
therefore, has chosen to deﬁne a good relationship as one that provides both
partners with long-term pleasure and satisfaction and a minimum of pain.
Accordingly, he hypothesizes, people are attracted to a relationship that holds
the greatest promise of continued pleasure over the long run.
REBT theory suggests what is satisfying in a relationship (sex, companion-
ship, intellectual stimulation) is very much an individual matter. Moreover,
what one person or couple ﬁnds satisfying or dislikes is also subject to change
over time. As such, REBT adopts a very ﬂexible view of marriage. It proposes no
universal prescriptions, nor rules for what people must or must not do in
relationships; only individualized preferences!
Relationship dissatisfaction versus relationship disturbance
If REBT is not merely a guide to people in speciﬁc ways to achieve a good
relationship, then what does it do? To indicate the important contribution Ellis
makes to mating, let’s take a look into how it conceptualizes relationship
problems. This is one of the most powerful distinctions of Ellis.
Relationshipdissatisfactionoccurswhenoneofthepartners(orboth)doesnot
provide what the other partner wants, or provides what the other partner does
not want. Relationship dissatisfaction is a very common condition in long-
standing relationships and often results from changes in one or both of the
partners over the years. Dissatisfaction does not mean that there is anything
seriously wrong with the relationship nor with your partner.
Let’s take the example of Mrs. Howard who early in her relationship with her
husband was quite happy to give up her job in order that she could take care of
her two children on a full-time basis and was willing to shoulder most of the
domestic responsibilities of cooking, cleaning, and shopping. As the years went
by and the children grew older, Mrs. Howard began to want more time for
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
112

herself during the week, so that she could set up a business of her own at home
which involved her designing creative displays for department and other retail
stores. When she made her wishes known to her husband and enlisted his
cooperation in sharing domestic responsibilities, Mr. Howard seemed willing
enough, but never actuallymanaged to do any of the work. In this scenario, both
spouses may experience a reduction in satisfaction with their relationship.
Along with the dissatisfaction, both parties will also experience some negative
emotions such as annoyance, irritation, or concern.
The dissatisfaction in the Howard relationship may be short-lived until a
solution is found; and if no solution is found, if the dissatisfaction lasts too long,
it may threaten the long-term survival of the relationship.
This scenario illustrates relationship dissatisfaction in that even though
neither of the partners is receiving what they want, they are not overly upsetting
themselves about their dissatisfaction.
A relationship disturbance, on the other hand, occurs when you or your partner
become intensely upset (anxious, enraged, depressed) about a problem in the
relationship and engage in self-defeating behavior that generally leads to an
escalation of your difﬁculties. In the case of the Howards, if Mr. Howard became
very upset because of his wife’s desire for more independence and for him to do
more of the housework, or if Mrs. Howard, because of her husband’s reluctance to
share in home duties became furious with him, then their emotional reaction
towards each other would represent a relationship disturbance.
Ellis proposes that when either or both partners become overly upset about a
problem which exists in the relationship, then it is most desirable that the
relationship disturbance be resolved (emotions calmed down) before the issue
which is causing the relationship dissatisfaction can be solved. Said in a simple
way, when either you or your partner are overly upset about some aspect of each
other’s behavior, you had better ﬁrst calm themselves down and make them-
selves appropriately sorry rather than inappropriately enraged in order to get
their partner or themselves to change.
Ellis’ contribution to mating is in helping partners (1) to understand that
extremeinappropriateemotionalreactionstoproblemsaregenerallyharmfulto
the relationship and can become sources of both dissatisfaction and distur-
bance; (2) to see how their irrational beliefs are causing them to overly upset
themselves about their partner’s behavior; and (3) to help both partners to gain
control over their emotions through thinking more rationally.
Anger-creating beliefs
There are three major irrationalities that lead people to becoming overly upset
about their partner’s behavior.
1 “My feelings are caused by outside events and, in particular, my mate’s
behavior and are, therefore, uncontrollable.” This erroneous idea is
frequently hurled about when couples are in conﬂict. “You make me
Relationships
113

so angry.” “When you go ahead and do that you make me feel so worried.”
“You make me so depressed when you . . .” In working with couples who
blame each other for their feelings, Ellis quickly steps in and disputes the
idea that upset partners can do little to change how they feel. He helps both
partners to accept emotional responsibility for their own feelings by
explaining how their own thinking and beliefs create their emotional
upsets, rather than the behavior of their partner.
A primary method for teaching couples emotional responsibility is by
correcting them whenever they say “He (or she) makes me so upset” by
getting them to state correctly, “I upset myself when he (or she) does . . .”
2 “For me to be a worthwhile person, my mate must love and approve of
me all the time.” This irrational equation of self-worth with love char-
acterizes super-romantic love and leads to the holder experiencing overly
intense feelings of anxiety and jealousy when his or her partner’s atten-
tions are directed towards another, depression when it is withheld for an
extended period, and, overwhelming depression in the case of separation
from one’s partner. As has already been elaborated, a more rational
approach to love is to desire it but not to deﬁne happiness or self-worth in
terms of its presence. A rational preference for love will enable one to enjoy
the satisfaction of having it, but will not result in panic should its existence
be threatened or denied.
3 “My mate must treat me considerately, and kindly, and fairly, and in
precisely the way I want them to treat me. When they don’t he (or she)
should be blamed, damned, and punished.”13
In appreciating Ellis’ approach to solving relationship disturbances, it is
important to recognize that Ellis and REBT are vehemently anti-anger.
According to Ellis, when one (or both) partner in a relationship becomes
extremely angry with the other for some unfair, inconsiderate, or unkind act,
the anger itself all too often reduces that person’s interpersonal problem-
solving efﬁciency and escalates the problem by provoking a negative reaction
in the other partner. Before Ellis discusses ways in which partners can resolve
their differences and communicate more effectively, he vigorously challenges
them to give up their anger, and, more particularly their anger-creating
irrational ideas.
The self-defeating and irrational aspects of anger in relationships are illus-
trated in the following excerpt from a therapy session with a couple who were
seeking help for their marriage and, in particular, their frequent ﬁghts.
I think you’re not talking to each other because either or both of you is
angry. If you just didn’t want to talk to each other, so you don’t talk. That’s
not a major problem. The problem is that you’re making yourself angry
with him and he’s making himself angry with you around and around
again, forever. Humans do this, they easily and crazily enrage themselves.
Now I hope I can help you to see what you’re telling yourselves to make
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
114

yourselves furious and to stop blaming it on the other by saying, “I’m
angry because he does that.” You’re not angry because he does that. You’re
angry because you have an asinine philosophy that people shouldn’t be the
way they indubitable are. That’s your idiocy. There’s no good excuse for
feelings of rage but there is good reason for feeling displeased and sorry, to
feel sorry instead of angry. You say, “I don’t like the way he acts and if he
continues to act this way who needs him? But I’m not going to demand, as
if I were Jehovah that he must not be the way he indubitably is, because
that’s how I enrage myself. My anger is a Jehovian command, and anybody
who is angry, including me when I’m angry, is acting nuttily!”
Unfulﬁlled expectations
At the center of many relationship disturbances are the unreal expectations,
which one or both partners have for the other partner. Ellis’ view of expectations
is that they represent what a person values in a relationship and as such, are
the basis or source of a person’s satisfaction with another. When expectations
are fulﬁlled, partners will tend to be happier and more fulﬁlled. The problem
withexpectations,however,ishowtheyareheldbyapersonandwhethertheyare
expressed as rational or irrational expectations. Let’s take a set of values such as
fairness, consideration, and kindness, which people generally desire for them-
selves in a relationship, and see how they can be expressed rationally and
irrationally.
Partners who hold rational expectations in a relationship will express their
expectations for fairness, consideration, and kindness as desires, wishes, or
preferences for the way they would want their partner to act and behave. And
when their partner acts otherwise, they would rationally or appropriately feel
somewhat upset (disappointed, displeased, sorrowful) and would probably
attempt to modify their partner’s action in a constructive way. However, when
people convert their rational preferences for consideration, fairness, and
kindness into absolute demands that their partners must relate in a certain
way all the time under all conditions, then they doom themselves to self-
defeating upsets. They boil up their own guts and act in aggressive, non-helpful
ways in trying to get the other partner to change.
Simply stated, if you tend to get repeatedly angry with your mate, it is because
you hold irrational expectations for your mate’s behavior. (Your anger is not
being caused by your mate’s behavior.) You’ll recognize whether you hold
irrational expectations if you ﬁnd yourself thinking “There he (or she) goes
again, that horrible creature! He (or she) absolutely shouldn’t act that way! It’s
too much for me to take!”
Another irrational expectation is demanding perfection of a relationship.
Some people because of the way their parents behaved towards each other and
toward them when they were children, or simply because of their own irrational
tendencies, demand perfection from their mate and from their relationship.
Relationships
115

Their irrationalexpectation is,“My mate andmy relationshipmust beperfect
at all times. When things are not perfect, my mate and relationship are no good
at all!”
These perfectionistic commands will tend to result in repeated episodes of
severe frustration and anger, which will often lead to relationship disturbance
and disruption. Ellis disputes perfectionism in any area of human endeavor by
getting people to accept the inherent imperfections of all human beings and to
acknowledge that people should behave imperfectly because that’s the way they
are – fallible!
I-can’t-stand-it-itis
As was discussed in Chapter 3, angry people tend to be very intolerant of other’s
imperfections and of difﬁcult life conditions.
Embracing a philosophy coined “I-can’t-stand-it-itis,” angry people take an
unfair,obnoxious,orfrustratingeventandconvincethemselvesthatbecausethe
event absolutely shouldn’t have happened to them and because the frustration
they experience is so awful, they literally cannot tolerate its existence.
This philosophy of low-frustration tolerance is frequently at the center of
relationship quarrels. One partner does something which is seen by the other as
inconsiderate, and the other thinks, “I can’t stand it!” which then results in a
huge boost to his or her anger temperature. In the transcript that follows, you’ll
see how a 28-year-old woman overly upsets herself about frustrating conditions
in her relationship.
BRENDA:
There was an incident where I was doing dishes and I started to feel
angry that I was doing these dishes, and the initial thought that
ﬂashedthroughmymindwasthatIdidn’twanttobedoingthat.But
Ialsodidn’twantto seethemsittingin thesink,soIdidthem.While
I was getting angry I realized that I was getting angry at Bill, who is
my mate, the man that I live with. I started rationalizing my anger
toward him because I had done a number of washes for him a few
days before and he had said that he would take me out to dinner to
thankmefordoinghislaundry.SobecauseIwastheredoingdishesI
decided to transfer my anger on to him – that he has the nerve to
leave these dishes in the sink so that I would have to do them, and
this was my thanks for doing the laundry. It just sort of all got
mushed around in my head, I guess, and I ended up feeling angry
and didn’t realize what I was doing.
ELLIS:
Did you stop being angry, or what?
BRENDA:
I think I just felt really ridiculous.
ELLIS:
I’m not clear. Did he really leave them in the sink or not?
BRENDA:
Well, they were his dishes and my dishes and I think I was just
annoyed at doing dishes.

ELLIS:

BRENDA:

ELLIS:
You don’t get upset without a should. You’re sneaking in a should
about the dishes and about him.
BRENDA:
Well, I felt I should not be doing the dishes –
ELLIS:
“I shouldn’t have to do the goddamn dishes!”
BRENDA:
And I shouldn’t especially have to do his dishes.
ELLIS:
And then “He shouldn’t have contributed to me having to do them!”
Youseeyourangerdidn’tcenteronthefactthatthedisheswereapain
intheassbutonyoursaying,“Thosepainsintheassshouldnotexist!”
And then you make yourself angry and that leads to your procrasti-
nation. You see you get angry at things that supposedly shouldn’t
exist, and then you won’t do them. This time you fortunately saw
throughitandmadeitseemridiculous–especiallywhenyouescalated
your anger by blaming him, who wasn’t that much at fault. But you’d
better look for your shoulds. You sneak them in.
BRENDA:
Another thing in that particular incident is that there are certain
things that I just don’t like doing, and I do have these shoulds about
them. You know, I feel like they shouldn’t have to exist, that I
shouldn’t have to do them.
ELLIS:
You can dispute your shoulds by asking yourself, “Why shouldn’t
they exist? Why shouldn’t I have to do them?” What’s the answer?
BRENDA:
Thereisnoreasonwhytheyshouldn’t.Ifyoueat,youhavedishes.IfI
didn’t want to eat, there wouldn’t be any dishes.
ELLIS:
It’s too damn bad they exist. I’m not saying it’s good they exist, it’s
a pain in the ass. But that’s what life is. And, as you’ve said, when
you eat you have dishes to clear. Or else you get paper plates! There
are alternatives. Normally, when you eat there are dishes. Tough
shit! If you really accept that, it will still be a hassle – we’re not
saying that dishes aren’t a hassle. You still won’t like it, but you’ll
just do it and get it over fast.
A rational approach to frustration in relationships encourages partners
to view both each other’s undesirable behaviors and the inevitable frustra-
tion as only undesirable, and not to escalate hassles, frustrations, or
discomforts into horrors. Ellis teaches partners to recognize that frustration
is inevitable in any relationship, because of the fallibility and imperfections
of humans. To demand that it should not exist and that it is intolerable to
bear will only make matters worse. Frustration, unfairness, unkindness, and
inconsideration are undesirable aspects of relationships, but that’s the way
relationships are.
Oncepeople acceptthe inevitabilityof frustrationin relationshipsandbelieve
they can put up with it even though they may dislike it, they are far better able to
do something without overly upsetting themselves.

Blame and condemnation
Aﬁnalmajorirrationalityunderlyingangerandhostilityinrelationshipscombines
blaming and condemning. Once again Ellis has collected evidence from years of
counseling couples which shows that when you blame or put your partner down
for having imperfections or being inconsiderate and deep down believe that your
partner is rotten and deserves to be punished, then anger and hostility will
characterize your relationship. In his work with couples, Ellis teaches the basic
rational idea of “other-acceptance.” This belief encourages people not to equate
their mate’s worth or value as a person with his or her behavior.
Rational acceptance involves accepting your partner even though you may
heartily object to aspects of your partner’s behavior.
In the following excerpt Ellis counsels a 36-year-old professional woman,
Marion, who has a great deal of anger towards her husband for ignoring her.
MARION:
I’d like to talk about my husband. I have a very hard time talking to
him directly. He’s a maths teacher but he’s very irrational, which
took me a long time to discover. He responds better to irrational
ways of dealing with things than directly.
ELLIS:
And you feel upset?
MARION:
For example, once this summer we were supposed to go away for a
weekend and he couldn’t go because he had to grade some papers. I
went the ﬁrst day and had a wonderful time. The second day, when
he came he ruined my weekend because he just ignored me. He was
very taken with other people who were there; and every time I’d
make some gesture or comment he’d say, “Why are you bothering
me and why are you telling me this?” And this is sort of a way that
he’s always acted. I’m never sure how he’s going to behave. He gets
very absorbed in other people and then I seem to fade into the
background.It’shardformebecauseIcouldnotevendiscussitwith
himandjustevenacknowledgingitupsetsme.SoIwoundupsortof
going off and crying and it ruined my day. It’s really stupid. I just
can’t cope with it. To me, it’s like he’s telling everybody there he
doesn’t care about me because he’s not kind to me. Sometimes he’s
very abrupt with me in front of other people.
ELLIS:
His main goal is just to do his own thing?
MARION:
Right.
ELLIS:
He doesn’t start off by being against you?
MARION:
I don’t think he does it deliberately. It’s not as if he sits there and
says, “I’m going to be mean to her.” I think it’s just that he’s very
self-indulgent. He does what he wants to do.
ELLIS:
That’s right. He’s somewhat autistic, he does only what he wants for
himself. And the question is, since you’re probably not going to
change him, if you want to live with him, how can you ignore that
and put up with it?
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
118

MARION:
Right.
ELLIS:
The answer is by not telling yourself that he shouldn’t be that way.
Because isn’t that what you’re telling yourself?
MARION:
I know.
ELLIS:
I want to discuss the general problem of autism. He’s going to do
several things the way that other people don’t do them. He’s going
to be less considerate, less concerned about you because he’s into
himself. That’s his nature. Isn’t that so?
MARION:
Yes.
ELLIS:
If you’re going to get upset about it, you’re just going to scream and
yell and hit him. It’s going to get worse. Then he may do things later
againstyou,onasecondarylevel.Onceyoudon’tlethimbehimself,
then he may deliberately do things to bother you. And if you ignore
his ways and are exceptionally nice to him, maybe he’ll change
somewhat. But what do you think the chances are? Let’s suppose
you ignored it completely and you were very nice to him. That is,
you weren’t negative, nasty or angry. Do you really think he would
change much?
MARION:
No.
ELLIS:
Right. Then the question is – the basic question is, once you’re not
upset, “Is it worth living with a husband who does a lot of this stuff?
How much does he have that I can enjoy and not enjoy? And is it
worth living with him?” That’s the problem. But not everybody is
that way. You always have the alternative of living by yourself.
MARION:
Yeah. Well, a lot of things come down to that. I guess I’m not going
to decide that right now.
ELLIS:
No. But the point is, ﬁrst stop upsetting yourself. Because while
you’re upset it won’t be worth living with him.
MARION:
But I don’t know how to handle it. Because, you know, I mean, it
never works with him. There’s something very peculiar about this.
And the funny thing is, he thinks I’m over emotional and I get too
excited. But I point out to him that he never pays attention or hears
me whenI saysomething to him ina civilized way.And now,whenI
lose my temper and over react, he says, “I don’t understand you,
you’re always over reacting.” And then it’s like he is justiﬁed to have
a kind of contempt for me for being oversensitive.
ELLIS:
There is a middle course. If you were not upset, then you could talk
to him very strongly and ﬁrmly.
MARION:
Well,thatisthethingthatI’mtryingtoachieve,becauseIcan’tseem
to do that. I get into these situations and then I always seem to wind
up the loser, even though I feel like he’s being unkind to me.
ELLIS:
Because you’re insisting he shouldn’t be the way he is. Then you’re
going to get upset and it’s not going to get you anywhere even if you
win. Because, suppose your loud voice prevails, you’re upset. And
your overemotionalism is going to knock you off.

119

MARION:
Well, there is no doubt of that. But the point is I don’t see, I can’t see
another way of dealing with it except frontally.
ELLIS:
First, we better deal with you and your upsetness. Then maybe there
is away ofdealing with him, suchasﬁrstly raising yourvoice. Ioften
tell a story of what happened to me years ago when I ordered some
slipcovers? Did I ever tell you about it?
Theywroteontheorderthedateofdeliveryandtheywereverylate.
They ﬁnally called me up and said “We have your slip covers come
over and get them.” I said, “What do you mean? It’s a Saturday, I’m
not going to come over, I’m with clients.” “Well, we have nobody to
deliver them. So forget it.” So I said “Look, you goddamn bastards,
you lousy bastards” and I deliberately yelled and screamed at them
andsaid,“Yougetthoseslipcoversoverhereimmediately,andImean

President and tell them to cut your balls off!” And I could hear the

Separating
Divorce, rationally viewed, is an essential component of democracy. There
preferably should be no interference with a person responsibly entering or
leaving a marriage.4
Over the past years, both societal norms and legal sanctions concerning
marriageanddivorceinmanywesternindustrialsocietieshavebeguntobecome
more liberal and accepting of divorce. The election of a divorcee, Ronald
Reagan, as President of the United States suggested that society no longer views
someone who gets a divorce as a horrible failure or sinner. Divorce is no longer
viewed as terrible.
Nonetheless, divorce and the other two forms of how love relationships end –
separation and death – often represent the severest form of stress people may
experience.
EllisandREBTovertheyearshaveanalyzedthenatureofdebilitatingformsof
emotional distress and grief, which often accompany the ending of a loving
relationship, and have shown how people can help emotionally disentangle
themselves from a relationship.
Issues in ending a relationship
Consistent with Ellis’ humanistic philosophy, the welfare and happiness of
partners in a marriage (and other types of living arrangements) are more
important than the institution of marriage itself. Ellis has always rejected the
notion that “marriages are made in heaven” and that they must last forever.
Hisview,whichhehasmaintainedconsistentlyovertheyears,isthatformany
different reasons, a particular marriage may not hold any good possibility of
bringing long-term pleasure, satisfaction, and happiness for either or both
partners.When oneorboth partnersarriveatthatdecision,Ellis wouldconsider
it appropriate for the relationship to terminate.
There is no simple way which Ellis and REBT help distressed couples to arrive
at a decision to stay together or not. This decision is seen as one made gradually
over time, not infrequently with the help of a marriage counselor. One objective
procedure, which Ellis refers to as the hedonic calculus, is for each partner to list
the positive and negative short-term and long-term consequences of staying
together as well as separating. A related procedure called referenting involves
having the partner who is contemplating impulsively ending the relationship to
focus on the disadvantages of leaving as well as the advantages of staying.
There are a number of reasons why couples contemplating separation may
decidetostaytogether.Firstandmostimportantly,bothpartnersmaybewilling
to work together to solve their problems. Second, both partners may agree that
the practical advantages of staying together (ﬁnancial security, nice home,
Relationships
121

children) are sufﬁcient for them to be willing to making sacriﬁces of their
emotional urges to leave. Third, the partner who is contemplating leaving sees
that the relationship provides enough sexual, romantic, and emotional satis-
faction to compensate for practical incompatibilities (e.g., different interests).
When a couple considers ending the relationship, Ellis helps one or both to
recognize problems that they may be overly upsetting themselves about and to
reducetheiranger,depression,oranxietiessothattheymaymorelevel-headedly
consider the costs and beneﬁts of the relationship.
Helping one or both partner to gain emotional control is an especially vital
task if one of them has been having an affair with a third person. REBT helps the
partner who seeks separation because the other mate is having an affair to see
that feelings of depression and anger commonly clouds the view of the
desirability of continuing the relationship. REBT also helps the partner who
is having the affair to avoid feeling very guilty, depressed, or angry at his or her
mate for the way they have reacted to the news of the affair.
Ellis’ approach is to encourage the partners to accept each other and
themselves without condemning each other for the affair. While adultery
canbeseenasdoingpossibleirreparableharm totherelationshipand, therefore,
can be considered wrong, adulterers are not totally rotten or blameworthy
because they may have done the wrong thing.
The issue of the welfare of any children, which a relationship may have borne,
is obviously one of the major considerations in deciding the disadvantages of
separation. REBT has no absolute guidelines for judging whether the disadvan-
tage to children of unhappy parents who live together outweigh the advantages
of them living with happily separated parents. Children and parents vary
considerably and the unique qualities of each family and its members had
better be taken into account before arriving at any decision as to the possible
adverse effect of separation or the emotional well-being of offspring.
In summary, if either partner is unwilling to work together to solve problems
and if either or both have level-headedly decided that the possibility of long-
term happiness and satisfaction is quite small, and if over an extended period of
examination and contemplation their opinions do not modify, then RET would
accept that there is usually sufﬁcient cause for terminating the relationship.
Problems in separation
There are two common problems people may experience after a separation.
Thesesametypesofproblemsexistforaspousewhosepartnerhasdied.Practical
problemsinvolvemanagingtheday-to-dayrunningofone’slifeanddealingwith
many new demands (ﬁnancial, living, childcare) involved in single living.
The skill with which these problems are resolved depends largely on the
extent of the emotional problems people continue to experience after the end
of a loving relationship. REBT is especially designed to help deal with these
emotional problems.

Ellis acknowledges grief as a normal aspect of coming to terms with not living
with someone who you may still profoundly love and care for. The grieving
process normally lasts between 6 and 18 months and during that period people
may experience periods of intense sadness and anger about their loss. If,
however, the period of grief is perpetuated long into the future and, as a
consequence, a person ﬁnds him/herself unable to accept the end of the
relationship, let go of the past (and of their expectations about what should
havebeen),andtorebuildanewlife,Elliswouldsaytheyareirrational,especially
if their goals in life are to be happy, fulﬁlled, and live with a minimum of
irrational misery. Again, REBT can be very helpful for anyone experiencing
intense emotional problems as a result of separation or loss.
A rational approach to the loss of love
There are a variety of different intense and dysfunctional emotional reactions,
which can result when one loses the love of a chosen partner either through
rejection or death. Two of the most common prolonged feelings are depression
and anger.
According to Ellis, people who experience feelings of self-pity, helplessness,
and hopelessness, tend to hold one or more of the following irrational beliefs.
1
“I must not be rejected by you, for if you do reject me there is something
radically wrong with me, and if that is so, I am quite an inadequate
person, most probably not worthy of winning any good person’s love in
the future.”
2
“I would, if I were truly attractive and competent, be able towin the love of
practically any person whom I really wanted; and since I have lost the love
of my beloved, I am unattractive and incompetent.”
3
“I need him (or her) right now to feel happy.”
4
“Because my relationship failed, I am a failure.”
5
“There will never be another like him (or her). And I must have someone
like that!”
6
“Other people will reject me because I have divorced. I will lose my family
and friends and I couldn’t stand that.”16
To help cope with intense feelings of depression, low self-esteem, and
inferiority which these irrational beliefs and thoughts create, Ellis shows how
to challenge these beliefs and to change them to more rational ones by
recognizing that: (1) while you might prefer your old relationship to have
continued you do not need it to feel happy again; (2) while your beloved may
have been a ﬁne partner, there are other partners with whom to have a good
relationship; (3) the person whose love was lost had his or her own reasons for

rejecting the relationship and these reasons may have little to do with the way
you acted; (4) while this relationship may have failed, the people in the
relationship are hardly failures; and (5) while it is possible that some people
will judge a divorcee harshly and, perhaps, be nasty and rejecting, it is certainly
possible to put up with this unpleasantness without having to like it.
An equally self-defeating emotional overreaction to the loss of a loved one is
anger and hostility. Some people are still so angry at the world and their ex-mate
for what has occurred in the past that any attempts on their part to form a new
relationship are blocked by their anger. According to Ellis, some of the irrational
ideas, which lead to people maintaining anger years after the termination of a
relationship, include:
1
“Ireally amanexcellent person, andyou donotappreciate andfavorme as
youshould!You’remeanandnastyforrejectingme,andIwillgetevenwith
you if it’s the last thing that I do!”
2
“After all I did for him (or her) all of these years, he or she owes me, I
deserve more from life!”
3
“He (or she) should have treated me fairer and better. He (or she) is a
horrible, no good person.”
4
“All men (women) are alike, totally untrustworthy, selﬁsh, and not worth
worrying about.”
5
“When someone whom I love and who loves me dies or is otherwise taken
away from me it is totally unfair and cruel. There is no one else in the world
who can make up for the kind of relationship I had with this person. I
cannot be happy at all and I might as well kill myself.”16
As usual, Ellis tries to help people abandon anger-creating ideas and does this
by showing that there are no guarantees in life for happy relationships even
though happiness is preferable; that one’s ex-mates may have acted wrongly but
that doesn’t mean that they are totally bad people who deserve to be punished;
that one cannot generalize from the qualities of one’s ex-mate to the qualities of
all men and women; and that rejected people’s prolonged anger will only help
sabotage their own goals of forming a new and lasting relationship or, at least,
living the rest of their lives as happily as possible.
In concluding this chapter on relationships, it bears mentioning that some
people have criticized Ellis and REBT for treating human problems superﬁcially
or oversimplifying them. His critics arrive at this conclusion largely because of
the way Ellis has successfully managed to boil down problems to their essential
ABCs. Many people believe that human beings must be more complex than
REBT suggests and that it is almost an affront to human dignity to understand
human problems in terms of irrationality. Other people have questioned the
overridingimportanceEllisplaces onthinkingandits inﬂuence overemotion.If
feelings are so inﬂuenced by thinking then it should be much easier than it is for
people to learn how to overcome emotional problems through changing their
thinking.

because REBT offers a theory of human problems, which is relatively easy to
apply to relationship issues, it doesn’t mean it is easy to use. In addition, he takes
a rather pragmatic view towards the value of REBT.
What Ellis is primarily concerned about is not whether REBT explains
everything about problems of dating, mating, and separating, but the extent
to which people’s relationships are enhanced by learning to stay rational in the
face of their own, and others’, irrational behavior.

Sex
My partners (sex) have ranged from eighteen years to seventy; have
included those who are single, married, widowed, and divorced; have
held jobs as secretaries, clerks, teachers, nurses, clinicians, and profes-
sionals; have come from various parts of this country and the rest of the
world; have been raised in a variety of religious faiths; have tended to be
physically attractive, but have also included some decidedly homely
women; and have ranged from the highly conservative and conventional
to exceptionally liberal and unconventional individuals. Most of them
have come from middle-class families, but some have come from lower-
class backgrounds. A minority of these partners have been seriously
emotionally disturbed; the great majority has been moderately disturbed;
and another minority has been unusually well-adjusted.18
As mentioned in Chapter 1, Elis is one of the USA’s most inﬂuential sexologists.
He began his own clinical and experimental studies in the area of sex–love
relations at Columbia University in the 1940s. He studied all available scientiﬁc
texts and research including the groundbreaking ﬁndings of Kinsey. He was a
clinician with over 55 years of experience in treating sexual problems and
disorders of women and men. He wrote extensively on the causes and cures of
sexual disorders of females.
While many of Ellis’ generalizations concerning female sexual behavior were
based on untypical and unrepresentative kinds of people (those with emotional
difﬁculties), he did rely on a separate body of evidence concerning female

sexuality. His own! Ellis had three wives, a couple of long-term paramours, one
woman whom he lived with for over 35 years, and many other short-term
relationships. And during these encounters, Ellis invited his bedmates to discuss
openly their sexual preferences and inhibitions.
In the early 1960s, Ellis wrote an article “The Facts of Female Sexuality as
Learned from My Personal Experiences.” The article had been censored for
being “too intimate” at a special conference on female orgasm sponsored by the
American Association for Marital and Family Therapy. In 1965, the article
ﬁnally appeared in his book, Suppressed: Seven Key Essays Publishers Dared Not
to Print.
In the article, Ellis, based on his own experiences, describes how different
women experience orgasms differently including individual preferences and
responsivitytovaginalpenetration andclitoralstimulation.Hesharedinstances
and examples of the wide range of sexual responsiveness that he found in a
sample of women and, as a result, offered some tentative generalizations about
female sexuality and orgasm capacity including:
1
Orgasm capacity seems largely, though but no means entirely inherited. It
does not seem to be mainly the result of early conditioning.
2
In most women of all ages, the clitoris is the main instigator of orgasm. He
hypothesizedthatthisisbecausewomenare“constructed”anatomicallyand
physiologically so that it is much easier for them to do so than to bring on
orgasm in other ways.
3
A large number of women are able to achieve full orgasm through penile–
vaginalcopulation,butmanyofthesewomendosowithdifﬁculty,takequite
a long time to obtain it, or do so only on occasion.
4
A minority of females who almost always achieve full orgasm through
clitoris-triggered orgasms are practically never able to climax during inter-
coursealone,nomatterhowlongcoitusisprolonged,orhoweffectivealover
her male partner may be.
Ellis indicates that the main psychological blocks to orgasm are rarely closely
related to childhood or adolescent experiences, but are more closely connected
with their current irrational thinking. He observed that some females are afraid
to let themselves go sexually when she is blocked usually because she is afraid to
do so with her present partner. The main physical block to orgasm is usually
the result of the male not knowing how to be a “good lover” and the females
neglecting to instruct him to give her precisely the kind of stimulation she
requires.
Ellis considered his own observations as not very startling with most of
them being conﬁrmed by other evidence such as gathered by Kinsey and
Masters and Johnson on their research. His advice to individuals and to
couples is to openly communicate and explore multiple avenues of genital
stimulation until one or more methods of bringing participants to climax are
discovered.

The Right to Sexual Enjoyment
Every human being, just because he exists, preferably should have the right
to as much (or as little), as varied (or as monotonous), as intense (or as
mild), as enduring (or as brief) sex enjoyments as he or she prefers – as
long as in the process of acquiring these preferred satisfactions, he or she
does not needlessly, forcefully, or unfairly interfere with the sexual (or
non-sexual) rights and satisfactions of others. This means, more speciﬁ-
cally, that in my estimation society had better not legislate nor invoke
social sanctions against sex acts performed by individuals who are
reasonably competent and well-educated adults; who use no force or
duress in the course of their sex relations; who do not, without the consent
of their partners, speciﬁcally injure these partners; and who participate in
their sex activities out of sight and sound of unwilling observers.2
During the 1950s and early 1960s, Ellis achieved great popularity (many would
say notoriety) for his forward and liberal views concerning sex. His frank and
open discussion of topics dealing with masturbation, pre-marital sex, and other
non-coital sexual pleasures raised the ire and anxiety of various sectors of the
American public. During this period, Ellis was subjected to extreme censorship
by the literary world, which refused to publish his articles, chapters, and books
on sex, for example, an article by Ellis entitled “New Light on Masturbation.”
Publishersforcedhimtodeleterelativelyprovocativeandcontroversial material
such as a chapter entitled “How to Satisfy a Nymphomaniac Sexually” from his
book (written with Edward Sagarin) Nymphomania: A Study of the Oversexed
Woman (published in 1964 by Gilbert Press).
Indeed, a county in Southern California banned a paperback edition of Ellis’
Sex Without Guilt (along with 99 other books including novels by Faulkner,
Steinbeck, and O’Hara). If you were not around at the time, you may be
surprised to learn that the New York radio and television media also censored
Ellis by refusing to “air” pre-recorded programs. Some shows went to the
extreme of requiring Ellis to tape his interviews a week to two weeks before the
program was scheduled in order to judge its “provocativeness and suitability.”
Ellis’ frankness about sex led to a form of literary and media sexual suppression
that at the time deﬁnitely curbed his public visibility.
Despitethepressuresofcensorshipduringthe1950s,Ellisdidmanagetoforce
his way into print. Some (but not all) of his books dealing with sex which with
persistence (and courage of the publishers) ﬁnally saw the light of day, include:

Ellis on Sexual Morality
Free love is better than puritanical love because it gave complete freedom
to any couple who agreed with each other to have polygamous sex . . . I
knew I could have free love with women for the rest of my life.21
Ellis’ views on sex stem from and, as such, are consistent with his humanistic-
ethical position which holds that the pursuit of both individual and social
happiness is one of the basic goals and values of humankind. According to
Ellis, happiness realistically consists of human satisfaction that is to be
achieved in the present and in the foreseeable future. Therefore, any action
(be it sexual or otherwise) which brings a person happiness and which does not
speciﬁcally, needlessly, or unfairly, harm the individuals involved can be
considered ethical and moral no matter what various laws, religious teachings,
or other authoritative persons may say about it. These general values or rules
of morality are applied by Ellis to sexual conduct. Sexual acts are immoral
when they are generally immoral, and are never unethical simply because they
are sexual.
For Ellis, sex itself can be fun and, therefore, had better not be enjoyed for the
sole purpose of bearing children. It is an activity which holds a great deal of
potential for bringing both the individual as well as couples pleasure and
satisfaction. Sex, according to Ellis, is very normal, natural, and desirable. Along
with domestic, occupational, leisure, artistic, and sporting activities, it repre-
sents a major focus of happiness-producing human activity.
Ellis has never insisted that all people must experience all forms of human
sexual behavior to be fulﬁlled and happy.
However, during the 1950s when many Americans were so very fearful of sex,
Ellisdidarguethecaseforsexuallatitudeandexperimentationandthatifpeople
could overcome a variety of their irrational and religious “hang-ups” about sex,
they would live more enjoyable and satisfying lives. In particular, he was
extremely instrumental in helping people to enjoy their sexuality by reducing
their shame- and guilt-producing sexual attitudes.
Guilt, which Ellis deﬁnes as a person putting him or herself down for
committing morally wrong actions has no place in human sexual relations.
According to Ellis, what people may consider wrong and, therefore, bad
(premarital sex, non-monogamous desires) can often be shown to be a matter
of personal and cultural taste, and therefore, had better not be deﬁned nor
dictated by absolute laws of the universe. Second, as will be shown shortly, Ellis
teaches people to accept themselves even when they may do (or contemplate
doing) the wrong thing – sexually or otherwise.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness

On sexual intercourse
Ellis has speciﬁed a number of attitudes and ideas in regard to sex, which he
considers as prerequisites if you want to have regular intercourse in a manner
that is mutually satisfying.
1
“There is nothing sacred about the act of intercourse.” Ellis has
always emphasized that intercourse is but one of a number of ways to
enjoy yourself sexually. Indeed, Ellis maintains that if couples view
intercourse as their only sexually appropriate means of satisfying each
other then, over time, their sexual desires and overall sense of satisfac-
tion will tend to diminish.
Ellis encourages couples to stimulate and satisfy each other sexually
in as many pleasurable ways as possible and also points out how a
partner does not have to be aroused to bring on the other partner’s sexual
release.
2
“Your sexual competence is not equivalent to your worthiness as a
person.” A second psychological rule of Ellis’ is that sex adequacy
should never be confused with your essential worth or value. If your
marital partner is not a good bedmate and you happen to enjoy
sex immensely, that is certainly bad luck, but this does not prove
that your mate is worthless or is a thoroughly poor spouse. One of
the attitudes which creates undue anxiety in people when having sex is
their own belief that they must perform well (or perfectly) in bed all the
timeanditisawfulwhentheydonot.“Ifyouconcentrateonhowwellyou
are doing at coitus; or how long you may last at it; or whether you are
going to have an orgasm; or anything else of this sort, you cannot help
detracting from your concentrating on the real problem at hand: which is
simply the act of intercourse and your enjoyment of it. The more you
worryaboutthedegreeofsuccessyouarehaving,thelessyouwillbeableto
focusonthecoitusitself. Inconsequence,itwillhardlybesatisfyingif you
lose your excitement or achieve a non-satisfying orgasm.”
3
“Be vitally interested in your partners’ enjoyment and success
for their own sake and because you love them.” It is important that your
partner(s) believes that you want them to achieve sexual release for their
own enjoyment rather than for your good. If your partner is overly
preoccupied with pleasing you and is afraid of asserting himself or
herself sexually, in the long term your overall level of sexual satisfaction
will be less than optimum.
4
“It is unnecessary for partners to achieve simultaneous
orgasm.” Whereas, simultaneous orgasm was once viewed by some
sexologists as the pinnacle of sexual fulﬁllment, Ellis argues that this is an
unrealistic goal for most couples to achieve because of the enormous
Sex
131

range of orgasmic capacity among different normal individuals. By de-
emphasizing simultaneous orgasm, Ellis endeavors to take away one of
the criteria which couples use to evaluate their sexual relationship.
Instead, Ellis advances a more realistic goal of mutual rather than
simultaneous orgasm, with each partner trying to satisfy the other in
some way. Even this goal, however, is not to be taken too strictly as many
partners do not desire sexual release at a given time but are very willing to
help their partners achieve sexual release.
5
“Communication is an integral part of good sex.” Ellis advo-
cates a no-nonsense, down-to-earth approach to communication be-
fore, during, and after intercourse. Partners are encouraged not only to
express their preferences for different types of sexual behavior and
stimulation, but also, when appropriate, to talk romantically and
affectionately to one another.
6
“Intercourse is not to be isolated from the rest of your re-
lationship.” Sex appears to collect troubles from other sources. If couples
experience signiﬁcant emotional stress in other areas of their life (ﬁnancial,
in-laws, children) and, in particular, if they are angry at each other their
sexual relationship is likely to suffer. Ellis was one of the ﬁrst sex therapists
to recognize the need to treat couples’ general marital problems at thesame
time as helping them improve their sexual relationship.
7
“Select a setting for intercourse which is preferred by you and
your partner.” While some individuals can enjoy intercourse under all
conditions and in most quarters, others are more sensitive and require
a proper setting for their maximum sexual enjoyment. Ellis advises where
one partner has strong prejudice in regard to having intercourse (for
example,amountoflightintheroomorintercourseposition),itisbetter,at
least initially, for the other partner to be understanding, uncritical, and to
go along with the practices, however outlandish or outdated they may
seem.3
Speciﬁc techniques for sexual arousal beyond intercourse can be found in
Ellis’ books and in other current-day sex manuals.
One of Ellis’ main contributions to the sexual intercourse area is to remove
both the sacredness out of sex and to rip up stereotypical notions about what sex
should and should not be.
On masturbation
Ever since Kinsey and his associates in the late 1940s and early 1950s found
that about 93 percent of their male and 62 percent of their female subjects
masturbate at some time during their lives, attitudes towards masturbation
have become enormously more liberal than they were at the turn of the
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
132

century, when masturbation was seen as a vice which in its extreme forms
lead to insanity. Since Kinsey’s reports, masturbation has come to be seen
as inevitable and non-damaging, as long as you do not do it compulsively,
nor as a replacement for irrationally feared sexual intercourse.2
In his book, Sex Without Guilt, Ellis came out strongly in favor of masturba-
tion in the 1950s. “It is difﬁcult to conceive of a more beneﬁcial, harmless,
tension-releasing human act than masturbation that is spontaneously per-
formed without (puritanically inculcated and actually groundless) fears and
anxieties.”
Consistent with his sexual morality, Ellis viewed genital self-stimulation as
a private act and hence not possibly immoral in the sense of its harming
another person. Masturbation was seen by Ellis as increasing your own sexual
pleasure and fulﬁllment and as a normal and natural sexual outlet both for
persons not involved in intimate relations but also for many involved with
another. In the latter case, Ellis saw masturbation as serving as an additional
source of sexual gratiﬁcation of each partner when the other partner was
uninterested or unwilling to provide sexual gratiﬁcation for the other or when
one mate desired it for other reasons. One would think that since masturba-
tion reduces the “need” for extramarital sex-relations, society would welcome
it as a safe, convenient, and family preserving sex activity. But, illogically,
society often has not wanted to hear this.
Ellis and REBT continue to see masturbation as abetting sexual pleasure and
as a natural way of developing a positive relationship with yourself and our
bodies. It plays an increasing role in helping women not only to achieve more
control over their own bodies and their sexual fulﬁllment, but also as a primary
means of tension release. Recent research suggests that women reach orgasm
more quickly through masturbation and that women who do masturbate have a
considerably better chance of reaching sexual climax with a partner than those
who do not.
On pre-marital sexual relations
For Ellis, the appropriate question to be asked concerning premarital affairs has
always been: “Many informed and intelligent individuals in our culture justiﬁ-
ably and guiltlessly have sex before marriage” (and not “Must a healthy young
person engage in pre-marital affairs?”). In his book Sex Without Guilt, Ellis
reviews the arguments for and against pre-marital sex relations.
Some of his rebuttals to the limitations and disadvantages to pre-marital sex
include:
1
The dangers of venereal disease. The infection rate among well-informed and
protected people can be kept low by using condoms and taking other
precautions.
Sex
133

2
Illegitimate pregnancy and abortion. Ellis argues for making contraception
available to “mature” teenagers.
3
Emotionalrisks.WhileEllisacceptsthatpeoplewhoengageinpre-maritalsex
are likely to be rejected, he argues that taking risks and being rejected and
feeling disappointed are part of the process of emotional growth and
development.
4
Exploitation of one’s sex partner. According to Ellis, exploitation doubtless
often occurs in pre-marital affairs not because of the affairs, but because of
the dishonesty of the people involved. The more open, honest, and frequent
premarital intercourse becomes, the less does it remain potentially
exploitive.
5
Sex without love. Ellis debunks the notion that pre-marital intercourse leads
to sex without love. Sex, no matter how it is indulged, normally creates and
enhances love. But Ellis also thinks that sex without love, though less
desirable, can be legitimate and good.
6
Lack of responsibility. Ellis declares that people have the right to obtain the
pleasures of sex without the responsibility of marriage.
7
Lackofhappinessinmarriage.Ellisbelievesthattheevidenceissuchthatthere
is either no relationship or a positive relationship between pre-marital sex
and happiness in marriage.
8
Promiscuity. According to Ellis, it is simply not true that if an individual has
pre-marital sex relations he or she will become promiscuous. The reasons
why one is indiscriminate in one’s choice of sex partners is because (a) one
has an unusually high sex drive; or (b) one has emotional problems. These
symptoms do not result from pre-marital sex and mayor may not be a cause
of such sex.2
During the 1950s, Ellis was one of the few experts on sex who was publicly
willing to voice his view of the beneﬁts to be derived from ante-nuptial sex
relations. Some of those which Ellis discussed include sexual and psychologi-
cal release, increased sexual competence, ego enhancement, adventure and
experience, improved marital selection, prophylaxis against sexual deviation,
decrease in pornography, sexual varietism, limiting prostitution, inhibiting
sex offenses, and fun.
Ellisanswersthequestionofwhetheryoungpeoplemayengageinpre-marital
affairs by concluding “from available evidence, it is difﬁcult to see why he or she
may not.”
When pre-marital intercourse exists between freely consenting partners
who are mature enough to know what they are doing, and when it is done
discreetly enough so as to prevent the partners from getting into legal or
other difﬁculties, it is obviously non-harmful and sane. And as long as the
fornicator does not lie to his sex partners, deliberately subject them to the
dangers of venereal disease, or use any degree of force or coercion to
induce them to have sex relations, he or she can hardly be immoral.3
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
134

Extra-marital sex
While you might expect Ellis to be an advocate of extra-marital sex, his position
towards its acceptability and desirability is tempered very much by the motiva-
tions and consequences of the act. That is, Ellis approves of extra-marital sex for
some people some of the time. His argument against its desirability is that
frequently extra-marital sex is conducted without the knowledge and consent of
the other partner. This kind of dishonesty breaches one of the main stanchions
of marriage’s mutual openness and unmitigated trust. And as dishonesty in a
relationship is frequently a cause of marital discord and dissolution, Ellis
counsels intending adulterers to weigh up the advantages of short-term sexual
adventures and pleasures with the long-term disadvantages (should their mate
ﬁnd out) of possible termination of the relationship. Stated another way, Ellis
sometimes favors extra-marital sex when it does not disrupt an otherwise
acceptable and desirable relationship.
Ellis has enumerated a number of unhealthy reasons for an individual
committing adultery, including: being hostile to his or her spouse, looking to
boost his or her ego, escaping home or work problems, escapism from sexual
inadequacy, or an inordinate need for thrills and excitement-seeking. However,
Ellis maintains that a quite healthy married person may also seek extra-curricular
affairsbecauseheorsheenjoyssexualvarietyandadventure,desiresmoregrowth-
fulﬁlling experiences outside of marriage, or is sexually deprived at home.
Adultery is therefore not in itself good or bad – but because of the
undisturbed or disturbed manner in which it is performed and whether it
results in undesirable consequences to the adulterer (such as break-up of
marriage). Ellis believes that many people who are quite marriage-oriented
and who love and sexually enjoy their mates will still continue – either
honestly or dishonestly – to have affairs. Whether they are hazardous and
foolish or valuable will depend upon people’s motivations, disturbances, and
consequences to the relationship.
Another undesirable consequence of an affair is excessive guilt on the part of
the adulterer. Guilt can be a major problem for not only can it be disruptive to
the life and livelihood of the adulterer, it can also force the adulterer in an
attempt to alleviate its painful effects, to reveal the existence of the affair to his or
her partner. Such revelations can frequently have undesirable effects on the
long-term status of the relationship.
In the transcript of a therapy session that follows, Ellis provides rational
guidance to a 48-year-old married man, Anthony, who is seeking help for his
depression and guilt concerning his long-standing affair with another woman.

ANTHONY:
That has been going on for about four years. We’ve been seeing
each for six but that was nothing like what it is today.
ELLIS:
And when did your wife have her accident?

She had the accident just over four years ago.

It was after the accident that you started with this other woman?

So her husband doesn’t know about this?
ANTHONY:
He does not know about this. As well, my wife does not know.
ELLIS:
You’re able to get together regularly both of you?
ANTHONY:
Yes, reasonably, yes.
ELLIS:
You have some difﬁculty?

ELLIS:
Do you want to divorce your wife?
ANTHONY:
I don’t think so. I said, by the way, what I’m saying here to the

ELLIS:
Why do you think you took up with this woman?
ANTHONY:
Because sexually and, with great respect, I say this – my wife has
never been great. My wife is the warmest person in the world. But
sexually there was never a turn-on.

This other woman is. Yes.
ELLIS:
How did you meet the other woman?
ANTHONY:
I saw her once and I knew a friend that knew her. I just said to
my friend was there a possible way that I could meet her. He
told me “No.” Then I saw her at the supermarket and then I just
said hello to her and she said hello to me and we started talking.
ELLIS:
So you met just by accident.
ANTHONY:
Yes, and since then we’ve been seeing each other fairly regularly.
ELLIS:
And she would like to divorce her husband and live with you?
ANTHONY:
Without a question of a doubt.
ELLIS:
And her sex life with her husband is not so hot?
ANTHONY:
It’s very good.
ELLIS:
It’s very good? So it’s not just a sexual thing with her?
ANTHONY:
It’s not just a sexual thing.
ELLIS:
But why are you guilty? What is there to be guilty about?
ANTHONY:
The guilt? The guilt is that I’m guilty to two people, I believe.
I’m guilty to my wife, who has done absolutely nothing to
create this thing, and I’m guilty to the young lady. And I’m
hoping that she would say to me, “Look, let’s break this thing.”
Because eventually I’m going to have to say that to her as
much as it’s going to hurt. I’m going to have to say it because
even if my wife caught me and threw me out of the house, I
wouldn’t go. I don’t know if I sound contradictory here.
ELLIS:
What do you mean you wouldn’t go?
ANTHONY:
I wouldn’t want to go. Let me put it that way. It wouldn’t be very
difﬁcult to convince her that I would like to stay.
ELLIS:
But she hasn’t caught you and there’s no reason to believe she will.
Now let’s suppose you could get away with it forever.
ANTHONY:
I would stay with the other woman.
ELLIS:
But would you be guilty?
ANTHONY:
Yes, I would.
ELLIS:
Why, why would you be guilty? Why should you?
ANTHONY:
Because that’s not my thing. Obviously during my navy life and
as a single man I’ve had plenty of women. But that’s not my
forte, just picking up women and going to bed with them. That’s
not my thing. I am not an overly sexual person. I can be, but I
don’t require, you know, sex “X” amount of times a week. It can
go by for two weeks and that would be okay. I would rather have
Sex

good conversation, a good dinner, that’s also possible. So I am
guilty.
ELLIS:
That’s no reason why you shouldn’t have a lover on the side –
especially when your wife is so lousy in bed. Now what’s wrong
with that? Why is that wrong?
ANTHONY:
That’saveryimportantstatementyoujustmade.Becausethisyoung
lady – she’s young, she’s forty – keeps saying “I’m your mistress and
I really don’t want to be your mistress but I am your mistress.”
ELLIS:
She is your mistress.
ANTHONY:
I try as much as I can to say, “No, you’re not. You’re someone I
love.”
ELLIS:
But you can love your mistress, innumerable people love their
mistresses.Amistressisn’taprostitute,it’squitedifferent.Amistress
is a woman that a man goes with steadily while he is married. In
France, for example, in Paris, they frequently accept that. In Latin
America, many men do that. A man often has a wife at home, living
with his children, and hehas sex with her regularly. But then, on the
side, he has a mistress to whom he regularly goes, and he might give
her money and he might not give her money, depending on if she’s
working or self-sufﬁcient. Now why is that wrong?
ANTHONY:
Maybe it’s my morality. Maybe it’s my upbringing.
ELLIS:
But why do you still devoutly believe your early morality?
ANTHONY:
I can’t ﬁght you on that.
ELLIS:
You see, you’re still believing it. We’re all raised with questionable
morality, religious rules and, when young, we are forced to go
along with it. But you’re still believing it. You’d better believe that
you havearight,inthe75yearsorso oflife you’regoingtohave,to
have a fucking ball. Now it would be nice if you had it with your
wife. That would be ideal. But anybody who has been married as
long as you have, 18 years, often doesn’t have good sex with his
wife. Many do in the beginning, but then it peters out and they get
used to each other.
ANTHONY:
I don’t even have to have sexwith my wifeat all.She’snot that type
of woman. She needs a bit of warmth, not necessarily sex, but a bit
of warmth.
ELLIS:
Right, lots of women are that way.
ANTHONY:
Really?
ELLIS:
Yeah, not most of them. But millions of wives only prefer to screw
two or three times a year. They are nice and warm but they’re not
sexy. Sex they can live without.
ANTHONY:
You know what is also a great concern?
ELLIS:
Yeah?
ANTHONY:
I don’t give a crap if I’m found out by her husband. That doesn’t
bother me at all, it doesn’t threaten me. I can take care of myself.
It bothers me if my own wife found me out.

ELLIS:
You mean she’d be hurt?
ANTHONY:
The drama, the hurt. She’s suffering enough or has suffered
enough.
ELLIS:
Yes, that would be painful for her. But not necessarily self-
denigrating. If she says, “Oh my god! What a shit I am because
my husband’s screwing around!” she would wrongly be putting
herself down. She’s not a shit. She’s just one of millions of women
who are not sexy and whose husbands screw around. As a matter
offactwhatwouldprobably happenifyoujustsaid,“Look,dear,if
you want to do anything about my adultery, go divorce me. That’s
tough but I’m going to continue?” She’d probably accept it and
just let you quietly do it – that’s probably what would happen, you
know. However, I’m not telling you to go tell her.
ANTHONY:
Of course not.
ELLIS:
If sheﬁnds out thechances are shewon’tgive that much ofa damn
because she’s not losing out on sex.
ANTHONY:
What about my young, I’ll call her mistress, who wants to marry
me?
ELLIS:
Your mistress knows you’re solidly married. She hopes you won’t
be but right now you are. So she’s taking her chances there’s
nothing wrong with that, as long as she recognizes the hazards in
which she’s choosing to involve herself.
ANTHONY:
Absolutely.
ELLIS:
If she were wise, what should she really do?
ANTHONY:
She’d kiss me off.
ELLIS:
Perhaps. Or she’d divorce her husband and go out and ﬁnd another
man who is fully available. But she probably won’t do that and
because she’s hung up on you she’ll almost certainly stay with you.
ANTHONY:
Also there’s a guilt if she’s found out. She’s been warned by her
“friends,” “You know, you’re putting your life on the line because
you’re married to this nut, and he’ll beat the shit out of you!”
ELLIS:
You mean her husband?
ANTHONY:
Yes. She knows that, she says, “I’m taking my chances.”
ELLIS:
He probably won’t beat the shit out of her or she’ll get him
arrested. That’s what she could do. She’s taking a risk, but you’re
not putting a gun to her head and saying she has to. She’s deciding
to do it, so let her take her chances. If she gets in trouble she can
come around and see me and I’ll tell her what to do about her
problems. But she doesn’t have to make herself upset.
ANTHONY:
I should have her come around and see you?
ELLIS:
Yes, if she gets disturbed about it. It doesn’t sound right now like
she’s very disturbed.
ANTHONY:
Not at all. No. She just wants to get married. She wants me to –
ELLIS:
She’d better face the fact that right now you’re not going to marry
her. Tough!
Sex
139

ANTHONY:
That’sexactlycorrect. Imean, Iwouldn’tsayitthatway,butIhave
said that there’s no way I would marry her.
ELLIS:
So she’d better tell herself, “I wish he’d marry me but he won’t.
He’s too tied to his goddamn wife. So he is!”
ANTHONY:
That makes a lot of sense.
ELLIS:
So there’s nothing for you to get guilty about. Because you
needlessly make yourself guilty by thinking, ﬁrst, “I did the wrong
thing” –which wehavetoprove because wecould contendthatyou
did the right thing, under your unusual conditions, in having an
affair. Then, to makeyourselfguilty, you’re telling yourself, second,
“I’m a shit!” But even if it were wrong for you to do this, you
wouldn’t be a shit. You’d be a human who is making an error. But
howareyoumaking an error? You’re adding to your lifearen’t you?
ANTHONY:
That is correct. I’m looking for a little happiness myself.
ELLIS:
So what the devil is your crime?
ANTHONY:
I don’t know. You’re right. The rationale is there.
ELLIS:
Yes.
ANTHONY:
Look, I take care of my children.
ELLIS:
Right. Now if we can get you to make yourself un-guilty, I think
your memory will be better. That’s one of the things you com-
plained about – poor memory.
ANTHONY:
You mean, you think I’m punishing my brain cells?
ELLIS:
In a way. Because you distract yourself so much with “Look what
I’mdoing,lookwhatI’mdoing!”thatyoudon’tremembercertain
things. You’re obviously worried, guilty, self-downing about your
affair when there’s no damned reason you have to be. The worst
that will happen to you is that your wife will get after you and that
won’tbetheendoftheworld.Ifshedoes.ButIdon’tthinkshewill.
She may even know this now and be keeping her mouth shut.
ANTHONY:
I would think that she knows right now.
ELLIS:
She probably keeps her mouth shut because she knows –
ANTHONY:
I’ve behaved very, very badly.
ELLIS:
Which side is her bread buttered on? She knows goddamned well
that if she divorced you she wouldn’t be as well off as she is now.
Isn’t that right?
ANTHONY:
I’m not sure that that’s correct either. Because, again, with my
guilt about divorcing her, other than my business she could have
every fucking thing that I have.
ELLIS:
Also she’d be alone.
ANTHONY:
Yes, that’s what she’s afraid of.
ELLIS:
She’d be horriﬁed.
ANTHONY:
Right. She mentions that on a constant basis.
ELLIS:
So she’s probably not going to divorce you even if she ﬁnds out
about your affair.
ANTHONY:
I think you might be right.

They say, “If he’s screwing around, let him screw around, as long

A Rational Approach to Sex Problems
As Alfred Adler pointed out many years ago, and as modern psychoana-
lytic theorists are increasingly accepting, most human problems are not
sex but ego difﬁculties. Troubled people instead of being truly concerned
with their own preferences and attempting to see how they can best get out
of life what they really want, such as love, sex, and work satisfaction, are
inordinately concerned with comparing themselves to others and with
thinking themselves worthless unless they conform to, andat least equal or
surpass, others’ standards and values. Consequently, they lose the proper
focus on their own tastes and desires and incompetently and unhappily
chase themselves around the tree of life instead of enjoying its fruits.
Mostpsychologicalsexproblemsarelinkedwithignoranceandirrationality.
When you are sexually disturbed, you may deﬁne sex in a needlessly
restrictive or limited way (deify penile–vaginal intercourse) and thereby
seriously interfere with your and your partner’s satisfactions. Or, instead
of desiring sexual pleasure, you may absolutistically demand it – demand
it quickly and easily, without effort, and command that you (and your
partner) perform it wonderfully well. If you are so afﬂicted, amidst your
sexual ignorance and expand your knowledge of what “good” sex really
can be. Give up your unrealistic and perfectionistic demands and look
for sexual pleasuring rather than erotic measuring. Get your ego out of
your head and your genitals and get your entire body and mind into sex.
You will see things – and feel things – much more enjoyably! (Ellis public
lecture)
Ellis sees sex problems as part of general emotional difﬁculties and as being
interactional as well as individual. Sex problems almost always have at bottom
the two main issues: (1) self-downing, and (2) low frustration tolerance
and anger.
Sex
141

As indicated, Ellis has treated both male and female sexual problems for over
60 years. The typical problems of male impotence and sexual inadequacy he has
treated include:
1
When men have little or no desire for sexual relations or have a distinct
dislike for them;
2
When they have little or no sensitivity or experience virtually no pleasure
when their sex organs are directly stimulated;
3
When they are speciﬁcally oversensitive or experience pain during sexual
contact;
4
When men obtain an adequate erection but are not able to achieve orgasm;
5
When they achieve an orgasm but receive little or no satisfaction or release
through achieving it;
6
When they have great difﬁculty achieving an erection or easily lose their
erection (by quick ejaculation or by its subsiding without ejaculation) once
they have attained it.
Of these various types of male sexual inadequacy, the last one named appears to
be the most prevalent one. On the female side, Ellis has examined over a
thousand women with sexual disorders, and has treated women who are not
easilystimulated, whoneverexperience orgasm,whohavepainordispleasurein
intercourse, and who have little or no satisfaction even when they do achieve a
climax.
Ellis adopts a psychological perspective concerning sex problems. It focuses on
people’semotionalproblemsaboutsex,aboutsexdifﬁculties,andaboutnonsexual
hassles as the major centers of “sex” disturbances. That is not to say that Ellis
considers all sex problems to be psychological. He accepts that there are many
organic and constitutional causes of sexual inadequacy (such as, inborn deﬁcits,
hormone deﬁciencies, lesions in the central nervous system, malnutrition). In
addition, Ellis recognizes that when couples experience relationship difﬁculties,
they can block their sexual performance. And in Ellis’ comprehensive approach to
sexual inadequacy, he often sends people for full medical check-ups, and he, of
course, treats their relationship disturbances. However, he largely concentrates on
how people upset themselves about potential and actual sexual inadequacies.
The ABCs of Sex Therapy
The way males and females feel about themselves and their sex partners is seen as
pivotal in helping overcome sexual inadequacy. Let’s take an example of male
sexual failure because of erectile difﬁculties or premature ejaculation. The way in
which a male interprets and evaluates his sexual performance (activating event)
will determine how upset he is and, in turn, his likelihood of future success in
thesexualarena.Arationalappraisaltofailinginsexwouldinvolveamalethinking,
“I would like to succeed in sex. I have just failed, how disappointing and
inconvenient. Now let me see what I can do to enjoy myself and to please my
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
142

lover.”Suchthoughts,whilegeneratingfeelingsofsorrow,regret,frustration,and
concern, would not create overwhelmingly negative and dysfunctional feelings.
However, many males tend to aggravate their sexual difﬁculties by
concluding, “How awful it is that I was impotent! I can’t stand having such
symptoms! Imustbesuccessfulinsex! Whataworm Iamforbeingsoimpotent!”
These irrational and exaggerated evaluations will lead not only to feelings of
shame and depression, but also, to such extreme anxiety about the next sexual
encounter (“I must succeed, I must succeed, I must succeed!”) that the
probability of future improvement, let alone satisfaction, is greatly diminished.
Oneofthekey aspectsof REBTsexualcounseling istoshowpeople thatifthey
gointo asexualencounter overly concerned about proving theirmasculinity (or
femininity) and self-worth, then they are almost doomed to experience sexual
difﬁculties.
Ellis emphasizes that if you are focused on proving rather than enjoying
yourself, your attention will be on non-sexual anxiety-producing thoughts and
your sexual arousal and performance will often diminish.
In helping people overcome disabling emotions concerning their sexual
difﬁculties, Ellis tries to persuade them to stop demanding success in sex and to
avoid “awfulizing” when they do experience sexual failure. In helping a male
with impotence to minimize inappropriate feelings,such as anxiety, depression,
and shame, Ellis invites him to ask himself four questions:
1
“What makes it awful if I display incompetence?”
2
“Why can’t I stand sex failure?”
3
“Where is the evidence that I must be totally successful in all aspects of sex
and be free from any problems”
4
“If I do behave impotently, how does that make me a rotten, inadequate
person?”3
Ellis then helps males (and females) to answer these questions by rationally
showing that:
1
“Nothing makes it awful if I display incompetence. It remains inconve-
nient and frustrating but that does not amount to awful or horrible.
Awfulness means 101 percent inconvenient, but that hardly exists. When
things turn out inconveniently, that’s unfortunate, but that’s the way it is,
tough! No matter how inconvenient or disadvantageous it proves for me
to be sexually inadequate, it will never prove more than that.”
2
“I can stand impotence, though I do not like it. I will hardly die if I remain
impotent.”
3
“There is no evidence that I must be successful and potent all the time. I
would ﬁnd it desirable, but that hardly means I must. I can still have sex
pleasure, distinctly satisfy my partner, and can have many kinds of non-
sexual joy, even if I stayed sexually impotent.”
Sex
143

4
“My impotence deﬁnitely doesn’t make me a rotten, inadequate person.
Having a poor trait never makes me bad. I can fully accept myself and keep
determined to lead as happy a life as I can lead, even though I have
important deﬁciencies, such as sexual inadequacy.”3
When you stop “awfulizing” about sexual problems, anxiety and shame
diminish. When you give up self-downing because of inadequate sexual
performance, feelings of depression change to sadness or displeasure. With a
decrease in disturbed and disabling emotions, some of the main causes of sexual
inadequacy are removed.
Irrationality and dysfunctional emotions are also at the core of many of the
sexualproblemsofwomen.InatypicalREBTanalysisofwomenseekinghelpfor
theirinabilitytoreachorgasm,Ellisprobesforintensebeliefsandfeelings,which
may be contributing to their lack of sexual release. Frequently “inorgasmic”
women irrationally believe they must have orgasm through sexual intercourse
for them to be sexually competent.
Assoonasawomanbelievesthatsheneedstoclimaxthroughintercourse,shewill
tend to become overly worried, depressed, or angry when she doesn’t. As a con-
sequence, when she is being sexually stimulated, anxiety- or depression-creating
thoughts about the probability of not reaching climax will frequently interfere with
her reaching a necessary level of arousal or a climactic response to arousal.
The other sexual attitude which Ellis zeroes in on which often prevents a
woman from achieving climax is the puritanical notion that the only type of
permissible sexual activity is penile–vaginal stimulation. Ellis disputes the
notion that women must only have sexual satisfaction from only one
prescribed type of sexual activity, such as intercourse. He educates them
to see that many women have much better sexual climax via direct clitoral
stimulation, instead of regular intercourse. He also points out that a woman’s
demanding to be satisﬁed through sexual intercourse only places undue
pressure on her as well as on her partner. This is especially so if a woman’s
sexual partner experiences temporary problems of inadequacy. If she de-
mands that he stimulate her through intercourse, the increased external
pressure she places on him is likely to prolong and exacerbate whatever
problem he may be experiencing.
It is difﬁcult in a short space to describe fully all the complex methods Ellis
employs in sex counseling. Referring back to Chapter 3, it will be recalled that
Ellis helps people change their thinking, feelings, and behavior. Many of these
methodsheﬁrstdeveloped whenhedealt withhumansexproblems,evenbefore
he originated REBT.
REBT sex methods for changing thinking, feelings, and behavior
It will come as no surprise that Ellis most heavily emphasizes the role of thinking
in human sexual problems and, as a consequence, has developed a variety of
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
144

methods to change people’s thinking about sex and sex problems. He disputes
with and challenges people to reformulate the sexual demands of both them-
selves and others into preferences, and get them to avoid exaggerating the
awfulness of sexual events, behaviors, problems, or situations.
More recently, Ellis has recognized the importance of forcefully attacking the
low frustration toleranceof many males and femaleswithsexual problems.Over
the years, he has found that many of his clients fail to carry out and work hard on
the therapeutic suggestion for self-improvement he provides in the sexual area
because they believe that “It is not only hard, but too hard to try new sexual
techniques.” “I shouldn’t have to work so hard to achieve my sexual and my
partner’s sexual satisfaction. Sex should be easy.” Ellis works together with these
clients to help them see that, “While it may be preferable if sex is easy and
comfortable, there isno lawthatsays thatit must be.Andwhileit mayinitially be
hard to change my sexual behavior and try new sexual techniques, it is never too
hard.”
REBT also helps to change people’s thinking (and emotions) by providing
them with a good amount of corrective information.
In accordance with REBT theory, this information serves largely to disabuse
people of a variety of sexual myths: for example, that they must have conven-
tional coitus to have successful and enjoyable sex, that all normal married
women desire sex incessantly and can easily be aroused and satisﬁed; that
spontaneous arousal must occur if partners are to have good sex; that loving
partners automatically and often feel aroused by their mates; that it is immoral
and unnatural to have adulterous desires; that foreplay, to seem proper, must
windup inpenile–vaginal intercourse; thatany knowledgeable person caneasily
turn on and give many orgasms to his or her partners.
In addition to disputing irrational beliefs and sexual myths, Ellis instructs his
clients on a whole variety of techniques that he and other sex therapists have
found effective in solving male and female sex problems.
Techniques for increasing female arousal and achieving orgasm
1
The woman who is not easily arousable can engage in sex relations at a
time best suited for excitability: for example, when she is relaxed, well
rested, not pressed for time, and away from troubling circumstances.
2
The woman’s partner can make overtures at a time when the mates have
been getting along excellently together and when there is a minimum of
strain and hostility between them.
3
Kindness, consideration, and love by the mate is likely to be more
effective than any rougher kind of treatment.
4

erogenous zones of the woman after these have been experimentally

Sex
145

5
Considerable direct genital stimulation before any vaginal penetration is
attempted is required by many females who are not easily aroused. In
many or most women, the vagina itself is not a particularly sensitive
organ, except for its ﬁrst inch or so (or introitus). But the clitoris, the
innerlips,andtheregionoftheurethraareusuallyquitesensitive,andare
to be adequately massaged or kissed for maximum arousal, and often for
orgasm.
6
Coitus itself, even though not too stimulating at ﬁrst, may lead to
arousal in some instances. Often, however, women ﬁnd coitus dis-
tinctly anti-arousing if it is engaged in before other forms of arousal are
utilized. As in all sexual regards, frank experimentation in this respect
is most desirable.
7
Periods of rest in between arousal attempts may sometimes be desirable.
A woman who is not easily aroused at her mate’s ﬁrst attempts may, ﬁve
or ten minutes later, be in a more receptive mood – especially if her mate
has been attentive and considerate during the interim.
8
The application of ointments or hand lotions to the woman’s external
genitals may sometimes be desirable.
9
If the woman is found to have special areas of sex sensation, such as the
clitoris or the upper wall of the vagina, her partner can exert steady,
consistent, rhythmic pressure on these areas until she approaches or
achieves climax.
10
In certain instances, special kinds of stroking – such as intermittent,
irregular ones or very forceful massage – of sensitive parts will be
desirable.
11
Verbal or attitudinal expressions by the woman’s partner such as
protestationsoflove–maysometimes helpbring awomantofulﬁllment.
12
Deep, forceful penile–vaginal penetration, which can best be obtained in
certain coital positions (such as the position where the two partners are
seated facing each other) may sometimes help bring a woman to climax.
13
Multiple physical contact is desirable in many instances. Thus, the male
may kiss or caress his mate’s breasts or caress her clitoris while they are
having coitus.
14
A variety of non-coital stimulations and coital positions is often desir-
able, since a relatively low-sexed woman may today become bored with
the same technique that yesterday was terribly exciting.
15
There is no law against a woman stimulating herself at the same time that
her mate is also endeavoring to help bring her to climax.3
While REBT’s most unique and best-known sex therapeutic procedures tend
to focus on how to change thinking, it also includes a number of methods for
changing feelings. Ellis teaches people how to change their feelings through
using fantasy and their imagination. For example, he instructs difﬁcult-to-
arouse clients in the use of “erotic” and “pornographic” images both before and
during sex to increase their arousal – and to do so without shame or guilt.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
146

(Before doing so, he disputes with them any puritanical notions they may have
about the wrongfulness of using even “bizarre” fantasy.) Ellis also prescribes
rational-emotive imagery (described in Chapter 3) to help clients, when
envisioning sexual failure, to feel only sorry, disappointed, and concerned,
and not depressed, ashamed, or panicked.
Another favored method for helping people change their feelings involves
them vigorously and passionately repeating to themselves rational statements
which will help them to more strongly feel better about themselves and sex (“No
matter how many times I fail sexually with my partner, I can still ﬁnd it highly
inconvenient but not awful!”).
Ellis states that humans rarely permanently change their irrational, self-
defeating sexual beliefs until they act against them. Consequently, Ellis
employs many techniques for helping people to change their sexual behavior.
One of the main methods he uses for changing behavior is called activity
homework assignments where, for example, sexually malfunctioning clients
agree to have more sex activities, instead of their common avoidance of such
acts, to have sex with a partner without at ﬁrst attempting any kind of penile–
vaginal intercourse (Masters and Johnson’s sensate focusing); to experiment
sexually with new partners if something interferes with satisfactory relations
with their present ones; to deliberately work on their hostility and avoidance
while remaining with an unsatisfactory partner instead of copping out and
running away from sex with that individual; and to practice using methods
for changing thinking and feeling until they achieve good results almost
automatically.
AverypopularmethodEllisemploysforchangingthebehaviorofsexuallyshy
people is called assertion training, which he introduced as an integral part of
REBT in his book The Intelligent Woman’s Guide to Manhunting. Ellis shows
how women can train themselves to overcome their passivity and can get
themselvestoactjustasassertivelyasmalesinsexaffairs.Speciﬁcally,womenare
taughthowtopickupmalesinpublicplaces(dances,singlesgatherings,bars),to
phone men rather than passively wanting for them to call, to make sexual

practices that they particularly enjoy, and to do other things they truly would
like to do.
In the therapy session that follows, Ellis discusses with Karl speciﬁc techni-
ques for overcoming his problems of fast ejaculation. You’ll see how Ellis zeroes
in on Karl’s anxiety and self-downing as contributing to his sexual difﬁculty.
ELLIS:
Right now, what’s bothering you?
KARL:
I have one problem. I ejaculate prematurely.
ELLIS:
Which means what? How quickly after intercourse do you come?
KARL:
Well sometimes almost simultaneously as I insert. Not always, but it
often happens that way.
ELLIS:
You mean usually, as soon as you enter, you ejaculate.
KARL:
Yeah.
Sex
147

ELLIS:
Right, and when you masturbate what happens?
KARL:
I don’t masturbate.
ELLIS:
When you’re by yourself and you masturbate?
KARL:
I don’t.
ELLIS:
Now, why don’t you?
KARL:
It’s never occurred to me.
ELLIS:
Well, you’re practically the only one in the world that it never
occurred to!
KARL:
Well, ever since I was a young boy probably, when I was 15 or 16 but
not in the last many years.
ELLIS:
What happened then, when you masturbated?
KARL:
You know, it’s a long time ago. I can’t remember.
ELLIS:
Well, did you come immediately?
KARL:
No, I don’t think so.
ELLIS:
You took a while?
KARL:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
And when did you ﬁrst have intercourse?
KARL:
When I was about 19.
ELLIS:
You masturbated up to that time, right and then you stopped it.
KARL:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Why did you stop it?
KARL:
Well, I didn’t feel any need for it.
ELLIS:
Well, especially if you had a sex problem, you normally would
masturbate.
KARL:
Perhaps, I was normal then, because it just never occurred to me.
ELLIS:
Well that’s very odd, to say the least. But, anyway, once you started
having sex, was it with your wife, or what?
KARL:
No, not with my wife to begin with. With others.
ELLIS:
Yeah. And what happened then?
KARL:
I think I’ve always tended to come too quickly or to come quickly.
ELLIS:
Because you were very aroused?
KARL:
Yes, yes, I think so. But also even if I wasn’t very aroused.
ELLIS:
Because as soon as you get it in, you get aroused?
KARL:
No, I would say I was aroused before I get it in. But then it just doesn’t
last too long.
ELLIS:
What do you mean?
KARL:
Well, just about as I insert it, I’m aroused then. And then it’s over
before I really get going properly.
ELLIS:
You still have sex with your wife, how often?
KARL:
About once a week, perhaps a little more.
ELLIS:
And how do you get aroused? Is it spontaneous or do you start having
sex.
KARL:
Well, we start having sex. Sometimes I’m aroused spontaneously.
ELLIS:
But most of the time you don’t, and how do you get aroused?
KARL:
By starting to make love. Foreplay.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
148

ELLIS:
You start to make love to her and she starts to make love to you?
KARL:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
And it isn’t too difﬁcult to get aroused?
KARL:
No.
ELLIS:
Right.
KARL:
Very easy.
ELLIS:
That’s no great problem?
KARL:
No.
ELLIS:
And then do you quickly have intercourse or do you wait a while until
she gets ready for it.
KARL:
I wait a while, normally.
ELLIS:
About how long?
KARL:
I suppose about 10 minutes.
ELLIS:
While you’re arousing her.
KARL:
Yes.
ELLIS:
But you’ve been aroused for those 10 minutes.
KARL:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
So, therefore, you are going to come quickly. Do you ever just have it
quickly, without arousing her?
KARL:
I do sometimes, yes.
ELLIS:
And then what happens, the same or does it take longer for you to
come?
KARL:
It takes a little longer, but I think it’s still all too quickly.
ELLIS:
Now,when youhave intercourse withher, howlongdoesittakeyou to
come approximately?
KARL:
How do you time that? Do you talk about it in seconds or –
ELLIS:
Well, is it seconds?
KARL:
I think it’s seconds. It’s seconds.
ELLIS:
It just takes a few seconds.
KARL:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
And what’s the longest it takes?
KARL:
Perhaps, 20 seconds.
ELLIS:
It never takes more than 20 seconds?
KARL:
If we have sex twice in the same, a second time.
ELLIS:
That’s what I was about to ask. When you have sex twice what
happens?
KARL:
Then it takes much longer, the second time.
ELLIS:
Ten minutes? What amount of time?
KARL:
No, no, no perhaps a minute, forty-ﬁve seconds. Perhaps, not a
minute.
ELLIS:
And your wife enjoys the intercourse.
KARL:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Does she ever come during it?
KARL:
Yes.
ELLIS:
She comes while you’re having intercourse?
Sex
149

KARL:
Yes.
ELLIS:
So she doesn’t have a problem getting an orgasm?
KARL:
No.
ELLIS:
Does she get more than one orgasm?
KARL:
Occasionally, yes; but not as a rule, I don’t think.
ELLIS:
If you have sex, and then you try to arouse her again?
KARL:
Yes, and then she gets aroused, you see.
ELLIS:
And if you have intercourse twice she gets two orgasms.
KARL:
Yes, not always.
ELLIS:
She could. Well, there’s nothing wrong with her. Does she complain
about the sex.
KARL:
No.
ELLIS:
She doesn’t complain?
KARL:
No.
ELLIS:
She’s not unhappy?
KARL:
No.
ELLIS:
Then, why do you want to last longer?
KARL:
Well, I just feel that she doesn’t get the full beneﬁt out of sex, nor do I.
Because I really only enjoy it the second time. Because the ﬁrst time it
seems to be over before I’ve started, and I don’t get the same thrill out
of it the ﬁrst time. And in the normal course of events we only have sex
once.
ELLIS:
And have you ever tried anything to stop, to retard ejaculation? Have
you tried any methods?
KARL:
No.
ELLIS:
You haven’t read any sex books?
KARL:
Well, I have but I haven’t read anything on that subject speciﬁcally. I
once asked my doctor and he said he’d give me a tranquillizer or
something. So I think he didn’t quite know what he was talking about
himself. So I just left it.
ELLIS:
Atranquillizer mighthelpbutIdoubt it.Somepeople takealcoholand
it does retard ejaculation to some degree, but then it has its disad-
vantages. Do you drink?
KARL:
No.I’m virtually a teetotaler. I havean odddrink ifwe gotoapartybut
I can go without drinks for weeks.
ELLIS:
So that’s not thebest way. Well, there are several ways that you can use.
First of all, what kind of contraception do you use?
KARL:
Nothing, my wife has had an operation, what do you call it, a
hysterectomy a couple of years ago.
ELLIS:
What did you use before that?
KARL:
She was on the pill at one stage, and I also used to use French letters
before.
ELLIS:
What happened with them? Did you come fast? Did you last longer
with condoms?
KARL:
Not really.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
150

ELLIS:
It didn’t matter? Because you can use a thick condom or even two
condoms. If you want, you can experiment with using a condom or
two, not for contraception, because you don’t need it. But you could
useittoretard orgasm.That’sonething. Theother thingyou canuseis
nupercainal solution. Did you ever try that. You can get it in a drug
store. You don’t need a prescription.
KARL:
Right.
ELLIS:
And it’s a deadening solution, it’s called nupercainal and usually it
comes in a tube. It may be sticky. You put it on your penis a half hour
beforesex,beforeyougotobed,andyoupowderitifit’ssticky;andit’ll
stay on your penis and sink in. Or you can get it sometimes in cans, a
spray can. You can spray it on. It sinks into your penis and it deadens
sensations, but it won’t stop you normally from getting an erection.
You can experiment with that if you want to. Sometimes it works very
well, sometimes it doesn’t. A main thing that people use, a main
technique they often use is thinking of unsexy things. Have you ever
tried that?
KARL:
No, I don’t think that I have consciously done that.
ELLIS:
What are you thinking of when you have sex?
KARL:
Sex.
ELLIS:
Yes, but that’s too exciting.
KARL:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
You see that’s one of your problems that you are easily arousable. You
always have been and you come quickly. Now, normally, that’s a good
thing. But it has its disadvantages because you won’t enjoy sex that
long. Therefore, what most people do is to think of something unsexy.
Once they get an erection, they enter their wives and they then think of
something unsexy – such as work or problem solving, you see. And
when that works they come much slower. So that’s another technique.
And still another technique is called the “stop–start” technique. That’s
a very simple one. You enter your wife with an erection, you go for a
few seconds and as you are about to come you stop, you interrupt your
movement and you stand, stay still. Then you start all over and you do
the same thing; and you train yourself to come slower. Now you can
use the stop–start technique to come slower. It almost always works if
you persist. Because you know when you’re about to come, and just
before you’re about to come you stop all motion. But be sure to tell
your wife that you’re going to do this so she’s ready and cooperative.
Now the main variation on the stop–start method is the “squeeze”
technique. This is more complicated and I would advise the stop–start
rather than the squeeze technique. But I’ll tell you what it is. It’s the
famous Masters and Johnson method. You’ve heard of Masters and
Johnson.
KARL:
Yes, I’ve read about some sort of squeeze technique.
ELLIS:
Do you know how to use it?
Sex
151

KARL:
No, I just read about it.
ELLIS:
What happens is, your wife takes some lubricant and puts it on her
hands so that her hands simulates the vagina. Because if she just holds
your penis, the texture of her hand is not exactly like a vagina. It’s not
lubricated.So,withcreamorlotion,shemassagesyourpenistillyou’re
about to come And as soon as you’re about to ejaculate, signal her and
then she squeezes your penis. That will stop your orgasm and partially
soften your erection. But then your wife goes right back to stimulating
you and giving you a full erection again. She does the same thing, and
she trains you with her hands instead of with her vagina to last longer.
Do you see?
KARL:
Yes, I do.
ELLIS:
Do you ever try letting your wife get on top, during intercourse?
KARL:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Does that make you last longer?
KARL:
I think so.
ELLIS:
It usually does, you see. Using the squeeze technique, once you are
partially trained to last longer, she can get on top of you and you have
intercourse.Andwhenyou’reabouttocome,eithershecanstop,ifyou
signal her; or she can get off and squeeze again and keep getting off and
on. That can be a pain in the ass but it may work. And that’s what the
Masters and Johnson technique is, if you want to go to the trouble to
use it. If you do, every time you are about to come, even in intercourse,
she can get off and go back to squeezing your penis. Then you start
over. But you can also just stay in her vagina, once you start inter-
course, and just stop and start, stop and start.
KARL:
And think about the Stock Exchange, or something else.
ELLIS:
That’s right, the Stock Exchange, chess problems, children, any
damned thing you want. But nothing sexy, because that won’t
work. And when you focus on the Stock Exchange or on chess you’re
not able to worry. You probably worry, as soon as you now enter her,
“Will I come, will I come, will I come?” Then you’ll come! But if you
strongly think of anything else, you can’t worry. It’s almost impossible
to worry if you use cognitive distraction. That’s the way the mind
works.Ironicallyoneofthebesttechniquesandaneasyoneis,onethat
few people use. And you probably could use it, if you want
to, experimentally. This consists of doubling, tripling, or quadrupling
the amount of sex you now have. You see, instead of having it once
a week, which may well be too little for anybody as sexy as you, try
havingittwiceaweek,orfourtimesaweek,orsixtimesaweek,oreight
times a week. If possible, try it twice a day. And if you can still get
erections, which you may be able to do, you’ll get slower and slower at
having orgasm. You’re probably having too little sex. Why did you hit
on once a week.
KARL:
Well, it’s not a formal once a week. It just seems to work out that way.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
152

ELLIS:
Because you’re not around that much? Suppose you were around for
several weeks in a row.
KARL:
If we go on a holiday or something like that, then it’s more often.
Perhaps three times a week.
ELLIS:
Three times, and what happens then do you come slower?
KARL:
I haven’t really observed, not dramatically so.
ELLIS:
Idon’tﬁndanythingwrongwithyouphysically,fromwhatyou’vetold
me. It’s probably you’re too highly sexed biologically. And then you
worry about it, “Will I come, will I come, will I come?” And if you use
themethodsIoutlinedandifyoufocusonnon-sexualthings,thenyou
won’t worry as much. How do you feel after you’ve come very quickly?
How do you personally feel?
KARL:
Well I don’t get the same sensation or haven’t felt the same as I would,
say, if I hadn’t come so quickly or as I would the second time.
ELLIS:
I mean in your emotions.
KARL:
Well I fell a little bit upset with myself.
ELLIS:
Well, but that’s the problem. When you say you’re upset with yourself
you’re probably putting yourself down, and saying, “I should last
longer!” Not “I’d like to,” but “I should! And isn’t it awful, and what a
shit I am when I don’t.”
KARL:
That’s exactly it!
ELLIS:
But do you see why that’s a crazy thought? Why is that crazy?
KARL:
Well, because you say there’s nothing wrong physiologically. That’s
the term you used. On the contrary, it’s probably that I’m over-sexed,
not under-sexed.
ELLIS:
That’s right. And also, even if there was something wrong with you
psychologically, there’s no reason you should, or ought to, or must be
successfulinsex.Becauseit’sonly preferable.You’retakingthesensible
sentence, “It would be nice if I lasted longer” and you’re foolishly
escalating it into, “I must! I have to! I should!” There are no absolute
shouldsintheuniverse. Theydon’texist. There’snothing thatmustbe.
“It is bad to come quickly it is a pain in the ass. But I am never a rotton
person for failing. There’s no reason why I have to succeed. It’s only
desirable, but it’s never necessary.” You see, we all tend to take the
sentence, “I’d like to succeed,” “I wish I did,” and we often change it
into “I’ve got to!” And then when we don’t do what we’ve “got to” we
say “It’s terrible!” But if we gave up our must, our must, our got to, we
wouldn’t put ourselves down for failing at sex or anything else. You’re
really saying, “I’ve got to last longer! I must last longer!” And that’ll
makeyouanxiousandyouwon’tlastverylong!Youcouldsay,instead,
“I’d like to last longer, but if I don’t I don’t! Fuck it, my wife’s getting
satisﬁed anyway!” Then you would lose most of your sexual anxiety.
But we frequently create our own anxiety, with some nutty must.
KARL:
Makes sense.
Sex
153

Today, REBT continues to provide the opportunity for people to under-
stand and overcome many of their sexual difﬁculties. Ellis stresses, however,
that change requires hard and continuous work on the part of the person (and
his or her partner). And where and when a sexual problem proves too
biologically rooted to be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed, Ellis helps people to accept
themselves and still enjoy themselves sexually.

Women
Some women threaten weak males. And men have their own problems.
They think they’re shits for not being good or strong enough. So you see,
no woman is worthless because of any reason including her not mating.
Because to be worthless, she’d have to be good at nothing. So if you’d go
through these things; one, there is no reason I have to be married,
although it’s desirable; two, it’s not terrible, it’s just a real pain in the
ass, a great inconvenience, maybe; three, I can bear the pain, the lack of
pleasure, from not mating; and four, I’m never a worthless individual,
then you’d start to overcome this problem. You’d still be alone and have
some difﬁculties in mating, but you’d be in much better shape to get more
of what you want. (Ellis therapy session)
Albert Ellis has always been sensitive to the desires and preferences of women.
In particular, REBT not only successfully treats the conventional problems of
women (depression, weight problems), it also is ideally suited to resolving the
conﬂictsofwomenwhich havearisenfromchanges intheirlegal,economic, and
political status over the past 40 years. It is becoming increasingly accepted that
many of the problems that are particular to women arise from female sex-role
socialization messages which women were exposed to during their early
childhood years. As you’ll see, these messages about the way females should
be are quite frequently irrational in nature (for example, “for me to be a
worthwhile person, I must have children and love and be loved by a man”).
Ellis has always been a champion of women’s (and men’s) rights. Consistent
with his humanistic stance, Ellis has designed REBT so that it can help both

women and men to realize their own individual potential and happiness rather
than to adjust to existing and, oftentimes, restrictive sex roles. Ellis actively
supports the notion that anyone irrespective of gender has the right to choose
whatever life style he or she believes will achieve their fulﬁllment and happiness.
In REBT, there are no separate standards for women and men.
It has been argued that the higher prevalence of certain psychological
problems (anxiety, guilt, low self-esteem) among women as compared with
men can be linked to the dependent, submissive role of women and, in
particular, their sense of powerlessness over their lives.
Other distinctive more recent psychological problems of women appear to
have arisen from changes brought about by the women’s movement. Women
are marrying later, having fewer or no children, single parenting more frequent-
ly, working more, and, in general, achieving more of an independent lifestyle
apart from the traditional feminine role of mother and housekeeper.
The striving for increased independence and non-traditional lifestyles have
brought increased conﬂicts and stress such as the consequences of not having
children, being happy and fulﬁlled without having a relationship with a man,
getting their mate to share in home responsibilities including a greater share of
the raising of children, breaking into positions of power in male-dominated
occupations, and achieving a sense of self-identity and acceptance in a relation-
ship with a man.
REBT appears to be an ideal therapy for women who are trying both to
overcome psychological problems associated with the sex-role stereotyping of
their early childhood years and for achieving happiness and a sense of self-
worth in their struggle for independence and autonomy. Whereas psycho-
analysis has traditionally viewed women’s striving for independence as “penis
envy,” Ellis sees the female quest for autonomy over their lives as a means for
them to achieve happiness and emotional well-being. In particular, REBT
combats absolute expectations about how women should or must behave;
teaches them not to deﬁne their self-worth (and rate themselves) in terms of
whether they have a man to love and who loves them, shows how, while it
might be desirable to be loved by a man, women do not need a man’s love to be
happy or survive; helps women to stop condemning themselves for their
irrational problems and their ineffective behavior; encourages autonomy
through client involvement in goal setting and assertiveness training; shows
women how to stop depressing or angering themselves about their frustrations
with a society that is not sex-fair and with people who act in sexist ways,
and also to determinedly for alterations to their world and society; helps
women understand that their feelings of helplessness they have are very normal.
They are not helpless people even though society has taught them to play a
helpless role.

literature on how to help women overcome emotional difﬁculties and live
happy and fulﬁlled lives whether or not they are married or have children. Janet

Director of the Institute for Rational Emotive Therapy was instrumental in the
development of educational and group counseling programs dedicated to
women’s issues.
Depression
Although the REBT approach to the treatment of depression is the same for
women as it is for men, in treating women, REBT is especially conscious of the
relationshipof feelings of depressionand the passive, dependentand submissive
role women have been largely socialized to play. Finding they have little control
over much of their lives, some women develop a sense of helplessness that
prevents them from trying to achieve things which would combat their sense of
impotence. As Ellis points out, women may continuously indoctrinate them-
selves with the irrational belief that “because I am not achieving and helpless to
achieve, therefore I am a failure, totally worthless.”
In helping depressed women change, Ellis focuses on women’s irrational
tendency (supported by their early learning history) to put themselves down.
In particular, he teaches some women not to equate their self-worth with their
sense of helplessness or non-achievement, to dispute that their lives are totally
awful, and to develop a greater capacity for tolerating the unfairness of their
world. Additionally, he helps women to use community and other resources
(vocational training, women’s business organizations, ﬁnancial aid services,
day-care centers).
In the session that follows, Marilyn, who has seen Ellis three previous times,
beginstoshowdeﬁniteimprovementinherdepression.Marilynisa42-year-old
social worker who is married with two teenage children.
ELLIS:
What’s been happening?
MARILYN:
I feel much better Dr. Ellis. Since the last session I really forced
myself to do things. I don’t know if I told you that for two or three
days I didn’t want to work. I would just lay on the sofa feeling sorry
for myself but I’m working now.
ELLIS:
Right.
MARILYN:
Well it was a little bit of an effort but you promised it would get
easier if I got started.
ELLIS:
That’s right, once you keep doing it becomes easier and easier.
MARILYN:
That’s true. With the depression I feel so low. I think everybody is
smarter and more intelligent and better than me.
ELLIS:
Yeah.
MARILYN:
And it gets to the extent that I don’t talk too much to people. Even
when the phone rings I hesitate to pick it up, I’m afraid I will say
something that doesn’t make sense. Do you understand?
ELLIS:
Right. But that’s nutty thinking. It makes you think that everybody
is better when they really aren’t and you withdraw. But that’s the
Women
157

wrong thing to do because then you’ll conﬁrm that nutty hypoth-
esis that everybody is better than you.
MARILYN:
So what do I do? I just force myself to talk to people?
ELLIS:
That’s right. Force yourself to socialize. And you’ll see you can do
justaswellasanybodyelse.Forceyourselftokeepparticipatingand
then you’ll distract yourself from your depression and, also, you’ll
get better and better. It will become easier going to work just as
you’ve said.
MARILYN:
Yes.
ELLIS:
You’ll see that you can control your emotional destiny. You are in
the saddle seat. You control it but if you withdraw and you give up,
you will think that it controls you. You control it.
MARILYN:
Yes, that’s the feeling that I have.
ELLIS:
You can run your own life.
MARILYN:
It’s annoying. I’m working with people and they ask “What’s
happened lately?” I’m not upset but as I told you before I try
not to talk too much. I mostly listen. When I say something I think
“Oh my god, why did I say it? I shouldn’t have said it!” I keep on
repeating and repeating it.
ELLIS:
Right.
MARILYN:
So I had better try this and not give in to it.
ELLIS:
Right, don’t give in to it.
MARILYN:
Dr. Ellis, do you believe that I have a long way to go till I get
completely well?
ELLIS:
It all depends on how hard you work. You have a long way to go in
the sense that you have to keep at it partly for the rest of your life to
keep thinking straight. If you fall back then you can go back into
depression again. But, on the other hand if you keep active the way
you are in the next few weeks you’ll be remarkably improved. But,
don’t think you can just rest on your laurels for the rest of your life
because people naturally think crookedly and they have to keep
reminding themselves to think straight andforcethemselves toact.
MARILYN:
What do you mean exactly by think straight?
ELLIS:
Straight means realizing nothing is terrible in the universe, things
are only a pain in the ass and there is no such thing as must, you
must do well, or you must be approved. Because that’s what causes
depression, your musts. Did you read my book?
MARILYN:
I’ve started it.
ELLIS:
Well that explains what straight thinking is. Give up those foolish
musts and stop telling yourself things are awful and don’t tell
yourself you can’t stand it. Never put yourself down. No matter
how poorly you behave, you’re not a worm, you’re not a louse,
you’re not a louse, you’re a human being who made an error. Now
that’s what thinking straight means.
MARILYN:
I wanted to hear it from you.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
158

ELLIS:
That’s what it means. But most people don’t think straight, they
think crookedly.
MARILYN:
That’s the problem I guess.
ELLIS:
That’s their problem, it causes their depression and their anxiety.
It’s poor thinking. And they can always change it because it’s their
thinking.
MARILYN:
How can I train myself to think straight constantly?
ELLIS:
By seeing that whenever you are feeling depressed or withdrawn or
anxious look immediately for the crooked thinking, look for the
must, look for the awfulizing, look for the I can’t stand it, look for
the self-downing, and ﬁnd it and give it up. Whenever you get those
feelings, you can dispute your irrational thinking. You immedi-
atelylookforwhatyou’retellingyourselfandchangeitbecauseyou
always can.
MARILYN:
So I have to be constantly alert.
ELLIS:
You don’t have to be constantly because the pressure will go away
for a while. If you really think straight you won’t be depressed. You
bettergetinvolvedinwhatyou’redoingandthenitwillbeokay.An
hourortwo lateritmaycomeback.Wheneveryou feelverybadlyit
means you’re thinking crookedly. It’s a signal that goes out.
MARILYN:
Yes, I realize this.
ELLIS:
Yeah. So you better do it many times but it won’t be constant. At
the beginning it’s more often but after a while you automatically
think straight most of the time.
MARILYN:
Yes, I understand you. It’s like forcing myself to do things that you
know are good for you.
ELLIS:
And if you fail you fail. You don’t have to put yourself down for
failing or doing poorly or being worse at certain things than other
people. You say “That’s too bad I’ll keep trying.”
MARILYN:
It’s self-conﬁdence I think that I’ve lost.
ELLIS:
It’s self-downing. You keep putting yourself down. Self-downing
means you’re putting yourself down. You’re saying “I’m acting
poorly” – which may be true – and then “I am no good, I’ll never be
able to act well again, I’m much worse than other people.” Now
that’s false. You’re just a human who temporarily acts poorly.
MARILYN:
The point is that at work I am okay. But still I have this feeling you
know that people are more intelligent, smarter, better than I am.
ELLIS:
Let’s suppose they were. In some ways there have to be people who
are better artists than you, who talk better than you, who read
better than you, who do arithmetic better. So what? If you say
“That’s too bad but that’s the way it is” then you’ll change your
thinking and you’ll see that most of the time you do just as well as
anybody else. But if you don’t, you don’t. As you grow older you’re
naturally notgoingto doaswellasyouusedtodo.Ican’t runasfast
as I used to, too bad. That’s the way life is.
Women
159

MARILYN:
Different things we expect, different things we try to ﬁght and it
doesn’t help too much.
ELLIS:
What things do you try to ﬁght?
MARILYN:
Well, I want to be as active as I used to be and it bothers me that it’s
such an effort to do things.
ELLIS:
That’s too bad. You better accept that fact that when you’re
depressed it’s an effort to do things. If you keep doing them they
become less ofan effort but if you start saying “Oh my god lookhow
great an effort it is, look how great an effort it is,” then you’ll remain
depressed. So it’s an effort. Too damn bad. That’s the way it is.
MARILYN:
I still have to do it.
ELLIS:
You still better do it. You don’t have to. You could lie in bed all day
but that will make it worse. When you’re sick you take medicine
and it tastes bad so that’s no reason not to take it, too bad, it just
tastes bad. Tough. You still take it. If you don’t take it you’ll be
worse. It’s one of the many things we have to put up with.
MARILYN:
Why does it seem such an effort to do simple things.
ELLIS:
Becauseyou’rerebellingagainstit.You’redemandingthatitbeeasy
and when you demand that a thing be easy it’s going to be a great
effort. If you’re swimming and you’re telling yourself “I must swim
easily, I must swim easily, it must not be an effort,” then it will take
an even greater effort to swim.
MARILYN:
I have to accept things the way they are?
ELLIS:
Yes, and then tryto make them better. Youalwaystry to make things

say “Isn’t this terrible, isn’t this awful” then they become worse. You
had better say to yourself “Tough shit so they’re bad.” You’d think
the same thing if you had a sore throat. You wouldn’t keep dwelling
on it “Oh, look how sore my throat is, isn’t it terrible my throat is so
sore.” It would only get worse. You would say to yourself “OK, so I
have a sore throat. I’ll keep reading or doing my work and going
about my business.” Most of the time you’ll forget about it.
MARILYN:
Yes, that makes sense. It isn’t good to dwell on things.
ELLIS:
That’s right. Don’t dwell on it. That’s what you do and it depresses
you. Dwell, dwell, dwell. And then it feels worse.
MARILYN:
It does. I think almost I’m going crazy, you know, because of the
dwelling, dwelling, again and again.
ELLIS:
You’re not going crazy you’re just in a rut and you’re insisting on
staying in the rut. If you say to yourself “Oh my god, I’m going
crazy” then you’ll feel worse, instead of “Isn’t that interesting I’m
thinking crazy thoughts I better give them up.”
MARILYN:
I’ll just have to learn a different attitude.
ELLIS:
That’s right.
MARILYN:
Keep on, keep on.
ELLIS:
Keep on going. If it’s bad you say “Too damn bad, so it’s bad. It’s a
pain in the ass, so it’s a pain in the ass! It’s not horrible. It’s not
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
160

awful. It’s just a pain in the ass.” It’s just like getting up in the
morning. Most people don’t like to get up but they force them-
selves up. Others say “just ﬁve minutes more, ﬁve minutes more,”
and they never get up. The discomfort goes away if you keep
pushing yourself.
MARILYN:
I saw it these few days because the more active I am the easier
everything is.
ELLIS:
That’s exactly right. The more effort you make the easier it
becomes. It’s not so hard. There’s a famous saying “If you want
something done give it to a busy person.” A busy person is in
motion and will get more things done.
MARILYN:
That’s true. That’s very true. When will I know that I’m out of this
depression?
ELLIS:
Whenyourarelyfeeldepressed.You’llhavethefeelingbutitwillgo
away more and more. In the last few days as you said right at the
beginning of the session, it is better. And it will keep getting better
and better. And it isn’t that you’ll never get depressed but you’ll
rarely get depressed. Every once in awhile you’ll feel it but not very
often. Then you’ll know that you’re out of it. Also you’ll enjoy
things more.
MARILYN:
Yes. Can a depression disappear one day or do I have constantly to
work on it?
ELLIS:
Normally, it doesn’t just disappear. It can get better. Your physical
condition can get better. You might think a little straighter, but
you’dreallybetterworkonit.Youcan’trelyonitjustdisappearing.
MARILYN:
I see.
ELLIS:
It can improve. Your physical condition can change for no known
reason. We don’t know why. You could wake up one morning and
besomewhatbetterbutthenunlessyouworkonityou’lltendtofall
back or it will only be better for a while. If you really change your
thinking then it only rarely will return. It requires a great deal of
thought, a different kind of philosophy, but there are obviously
people like myself who just about never get depressed.
MARILYN:
A lot of people have common sense.
ELLIS:
A lot of people have common sense like you, but they don’t use it.
They justgive up.People can withdrawfrom heroinif they wantto.
It’s painful. But there are many heroin addicts whom just throw-
away theheroinand go throughthree daysof discomfort. Butmost
of them refuse to do that.
MARILYN:
Because it’s so painful
ELLIS:
Because it’s painful and they all say “I can’t, I can’t,” instead of “It’s
very painful but it’s more painful if I keep taking the heroin” which
is true. In the long run it’s much more painful. People convince
themselves of all kinds of nonsense, but they can think differently.
MARILYN:
I hope I will be able to think straight like you say because I really
want to.
Women
161

ELLIS:
You just told me that in the past few days you did much better.
MARILYN:
Yes, it was a big improvement.
ELLIS:
Right, now the next thing is you keep that up until after a while the
straight thinking becomes automatic. If you do it enough it
becomes automatic and only once in a while you will fall back.
You can do it!
Weight
Being overweight as a woman not only represents a health risk, it also,
frequently, can produce psychological problems. This is because many women
in western society view their self-worth in terms of their body size. This view is
reinforced in countless ways by society where thin women are viewed as sexy,
desirable, and feminine, whereas, overweight women are viewed as undesirable,
unfeminine, and unlovable.
And because of society’s and many women’s preoccupation with their
physical self-image, it is, perhaps, not surprising to learn that many women
who enroll in weight reduction programs are of normal weight. Society with its
continuous bombardment of sex-role messages concerning women and their
ideal weighthas encouraged women to be obsessed with food and, no doubt, has
contributed tothe highincidence of anorexia nervosa (excessive food avoidance
and thinness) in adolescent girls.
REBT addresses women’s overweight problems by helping them recognize
and dispute their irrational beliefs concerning their body size including, “If my
body doesn’t look like a model’s, then I’m fat and disgusting. It is horrible to be
fat”; “I should be able to lose weight on my own, and if I don’t, I’m a lazy,
worthless person”; “I cannot possibly have a sex–love relationship, self-accep-
tance, or life enjoyment until I’m thin.” REBT challenges the assumptions that
many women hold that being moderately overweight is unhealthy, that con-
trolling one’s weight is easy, and that women are unattractive and undesirable
when moderately overweight.
The core rational for coping with weight problems is acceptance of oneself
unconditionally no matter what one’s body size. REBT helps convince over-
weight women that they can enjoy life and be happy as a fat person, that they can
stand being overweight, and that they are not hopeless for being overweight.
Dating and Mating
As has already been shown in earlier chapters, REBT specializes in helping
women (and men) who have love and relationship problems. REBT is especially
sensitive to any of the irrational beliefs of women that might lead women to
upset themselves excessively about any aspect of dating and mating.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
162

Many of the irrational beliefs of women concerning dating and mating stem
from sex-role stereotyped cultural messages about the way women should be.
One of the primary irrational beliefs which, oftentimes, can create unhealthy
stress, anxiety, and depression in women is, “I must be married.”
In the session that follows, Ellis discusses with Rhonda how, while it may be
preferable to be married, she does not need to be married to be a worthwhile
or happy person.
ELLIS:
OK Rhonda, what problem do you want to start with?
RHONDA:
Well I ﬁnd that when I go out with men who are my friends, if I
speak withthem I’musually verynatural and relaxed. And I ﬁndthey
often like me a lot, and call me, and sometimes propose marriage.
ELLIS:
That’s a problem?
RHONDA:
Yes, that’s a big problem! But I’ve been lucky so far.
ELLIS:
You avoid it?
RHONDA:
Right.
ELLIS:
Congratulations, Rhonda!
RHONDA:
Now with men I do feel romantic about and maybe I would consider
marriage with, I somehow scare them off. I’m not as relaxed and
natural as I am with men I have no romantic feelings for.
ELLIS:
So your main problem is to stop this anxiety. You’re afraid of the
good men. Right? The ones you like? So at “A,” the activating event
you meet a man that you feel some chemistry for. And at “C,” the
consequence, you feel afraid and you act worse than you normally
would. Is that right?
RHONDA:
Uh-huh.
ELLIS:
Well that’s very typical of most of the dating and mating problems
in the world. Now, what do you think you’re telling yourself at “B”
to make yourself scared, to make yourself frightened and
ineffectual?
RHONDA:
I must be at my very best and put my best foot forward.
ELLIS:
That’s right, you came right out with the “must.” Most people
would give me the wrong answer and say “I’d like to be at my best”
or “I’d like to win him” and that’s not true because if they’d only
stop with that they’d be concerned and that would be good, but
they wouldn’t be scared. You’re saying “I must be at my best.”
Alright, nowwe go to “D,” disputing. Whymust you be at your best
with this candidate who we’ll just assume is a good one? Why must
you be at your best with him?
RHONDA:
So that he will like me and continue to take me out.
ELLIS:
Alright, that’s why it’s preferable. It would be preferable, it would
be nice, it would be lovely if I were at my best because maybe that
will make him like me and take me out. It might not,incidentally. If
you’re at your best he might say “She’s too good for a stiff like me,”
so he might run away screaming. Is that right?
Women
163

RHONDA:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Let’sjustassumethatifyouwereatyourbestifwouldhelpyouwith
him. Let’s just assume. But why must you preferably be at your best
and preferably with him? Why must you?
RHONDA:
Because I would like the relationship to continue and grow.
ELLIS:
But again you went right back to the preference “Because I would
like it, therefore I must.” Does that follow?
RHONDA:
OK, how about “Because I must marry.”
ELLIS:
Alright, why must you go through the misery of marriage? Why must
you be delightfully married for the next eighty years? Why must you?
RHONDA:
There’s really nothing that says I must.
ELLIS:
Except me.
RHONDA:
Except me.
ELLIS:
Yes, you see. But do you see that there’s never a reason for a must? It
might be preferable for you to marry – and let’s just assume it is –
but why must you do what’s preferable.
RHONDA:
I suppose there’s no objective reason.
ELLIS:
I suppose there’s no reason, but there really is. I have to. Now
you’d better see that even when you just said to me “I guess
there’s no objective reason,” you really believe devoutly that
there is and, probably, that it would be terrible if you didn’t do
what you want, to marry. Now let’s assume you never marry, why
would that be terrible? If you never did. If you were unmated,
why would that be terrible?
RHONDA:
I think it would be a dimension missing in my life.
ELLIS:
That’s why it would be bad. Now let’s assume in your case it would
be preferable to marry. Now why is it awful, horrible, terrible if you
don’t do what’s preferable?
RHONDA:
I don’t know, I can’t give you a good reason.
ELLIS:
Well,youcouldgivemeareasonwhyit’snotawful,terrible.Doyou
know why it’s not horrible or terrible to not get this so-called
desirable thing called marriage?
RHONDA:
Because I’m an adequate person on my own as it is without
marriage.
ELLIS:
Right. And could you lead an enjoyable life without marriage?
RHONDA:
Sure.
ELLIS:
Maybe not as enjoyable. And it certainly wouldn’t kill you. A lot of
people survive; in nunneries and everywhere else. They survive not
getting married.
RHONDA:
Uh-huh.
ELLIS:
Well, the reason speciﬁcally, is because terrible really means totally
bad, oreven more than bad.Because it’ssodesirable –andwe’ll just
assumethatitis–gettingmated,thatit’s101percentbadnotgetting
that desirable thing. Now is that correct?
RHONDA:
No.
ELLIS:
How could it be more than bad?
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
164

RHONDA:
It can’t be.
ELLIS:
And it’s very unlikely it’ll get up to 99 percent. Because there are
worse things we could think of than not getting married, such as
getting married.
RHONDA:
(laughs)
ELLIS:
Or being tortured, starving to death, having a crummy job for 80
years. So there are worse things. Nothing is really terrible. Many
things are very bad – and we’re assuming this is in that category –
but terrible means totally bad, or more than bad. So whatever
happened to you wouldn’t be terrible. I could be very bad – it’s
possible not marrying might be for you – but it’s not terrible. And
then people usually say, “I can’t stand not being married.” Are you
saying something like that? When you’re upset?
RHONDA:
I can’t bear my discomfort of not ﬁtting in?
ELLIS:
Okay, why can’t you bear it? Let’s suppose until you die, you’re
unmated. Why can’t you bear it?
RHONDA:
It’s the loneliness.
ELLIS:
That’s the discomfort. Why can’t you bear the discomfort of
loneliness, of being alone?
RHONDA:
Because I’ve known very good relationships where they have good
companionship. I would prefer to have it rather than being alone.
ELLIS:
Alright, if you would stick to preferring to be married, rather than
needing to be married, you wouldn’t be so upset. You’d say to
yourself “I don’t like being alone, but I can bear it.” Once you say
you can bear loneliness, then you’ll be less likely to have to bear it,
because you’d be out more, taking more risks.
RHONDA:
Uh-huh.
ELLIS:
You’d better convince yourself you can bear it. And the other thing
people think is “If I never marry or am mated, as I must do, then
there would be something rotten about me. I would be an unde-
serving, unlovable rotten person.” Are you saying that to yourself?
RHONDA:
Yeah, sometimes.
ELLIS:
Alright, let’s suppose you never married, you really tried and every
man ran away from you, screaming and vomiting. (laughter) How
would that make you an unlovable person?
RHONDA:
I’d feel I was not worthwhile.
ELLIS:
How would that make you unworthwhile? It certainly would make
you unmated. Or unhappy, sorry, sad, at the very least. How would
it make you unlovable or unworthwhile?
RHONDA:
I don’t know, I suppose I’d feel like a big reject.
ELLIS:
Well, you would be rejected by a lot of people, we’re assuming that.
But is a women who gets rejected by a lot of men, unworthwhile?
RHONDA:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Why would she be? Prove to me that she’d be unworthwhile. She’d
certainly would be rejected. And even rejectable. But how would
that prove she’s a worthless individual?
Women
165

RHONDA:
Well, she’s not.
ELLIS:
No, she’s not, you see. She has value to others and herself in many
other ways although not in this one. She might be good at teaching,
greatatbusiness,greatatbeingfriendly,greatinbed.Now,howcan
you say she’s unworthwhile as a human just because no man wants
to mate with her? How can you say that?
RHONDA:
No, I can’t. There are many women who do marry who may not
contribute as much to life as she does.
ELLIS:
That’sright.FlorenceNightingalenevermarried.Someofthegreatest
women in history never mated. Many of them never wanted to.
Many women have devoted themselves more to different causes,
women’s rights, than to marriage. And others were considered too
good by males to marry; the males were tooafraid. Isn’t that possible?
RHONDA:
Yeah, sure.
Work
Women who are employed outside the home can experience their work
differently and, oftentimes, more stressfully, than men. This is because whereas
men are raised from childhood with the expectation of getting a good job and
earning a good living, many women are brought up to have babies and raise a
family. And while times are slowly changing, society still today views women in
the workforce with some suspicion. If they are married and have children, they
(and not their husbands) are seen as being neglectful of their family. And if
women decide todevotethemselves totheirwork,toassumepositionsof power,
and not to have children or not get married, they are tagged as unfeminine at
best, “lesbians” at worst. Society still does not seem to be able to accommodate
to the notion that women can be very successful as mothers and, at the same
time, realize high career ambitions.
Unfortunately, society reinforces through its sex-role expectations of women
a number of irrational ideas that lead to a variety of different work problems for
women.
Women with low career aspirations endorse a number of irrational ideas
including: “If I’m good, someone will come along and take care of me”; “I must
not be too smart or assertive, lest I be seen as a castrating female”; “I must not
speak too afﬁrmatively of my abilities, lest I be thought unfeminine or
bragging”; “It’s OK to make commitments to other people, but not to myself.”
Another problem experienced by women in the workplace is not trying
hard enough for career advancement because of feelings of anxiety, depression,
and extreme frustration. This lack of on-the-job assertiveness and associated
self-defeating feelings can be traced in part to the irrational ideas women hold
such as “There’s no use in approaching my boss. Why bother he’s hopelessly
sexist”; “Things are unfair; they shouldn’t be. I can’t stand it”; “It’s too late to
change jobs, to get what I want, to be retained.”
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness

Women who attempt the dual career of mother and worker as well as those
women whowishtore-entertheworkforce canbeoverwhelmedbysociety’sand
their own irrational messages about themselves and work including “I must be
young and beautiful (or more skilled) to get this job; and it’s awful if I can’t get
it”; “I must be approved of by others (who criticize me for neglecting my kids),
and if not, I’m a failure, a bad person”; “I shouldn’t have to be starting at entry-
level; I should be beyond this stage already.”
REBT can help women overcome many of the emotional problems, general
stresses, and practical problems which arise from their efforts in seeking careers
which can provide them with the ﬁnancial and personal security no longer
guaranteed through marriage (consider the 40 percent divorce rate).
Some of Ellis’ suggestions for dealing with various work issues faced by
women include (from the extremely popular, The Intelligent Woman’s Guide to
Mating and Dating, Secaucus, NJ: Lyle Stuart, 1979).
1
Encouraging women to look for good role models; join professional
organizations; concentrate on the excitement (and not just the difﬁ-
culties) of “pioneering”; and develop a support network.
2
Advisingdual-careerwomen toadoptdifferentstandards(e.g.lessneat
house and kids, less time with mate) and to see that their kids may not
be ruined, but rather are proﬁting from their mother’s experience at
work and increased independence.
3
Having available a list of resources for helping women combat some of
the inequalities in the world of work (agencies dealing with sex
discrimination, non-stereotyped educational and vocational options,
professional women’s organizations).
4
Helping women to be aware of the reduced expectations they have of
themselves and brainstorming options other than their stated goal of
getting $15 a week raise on their secretarial job (e.g. asking if they have
thought of applying for managerial level positions).
5
Doing lots of assertiveness training to help change habits so that
women learn how to ask for and get things without being manipulative
or indirect.
6
Encouraging conﬁdence building including having women log self-
put-downs and replacing them with comments like “I did that really
well,” “I handled that criticism much better than I did last time.”
7
Encouraging women to develop skills they may have told themselves
they “can’t understand” (e.g., taking a ﬁnancial management course).
Over the years, Ellis has seen and helped numerous women who experience
large amounts of stress at work. Ellis’ approach is decidedly non-sexist. He
shows women how to cope with others’ opinions and, in particular, their
disapproval without putting themselves down. In a nutshell, Ellis gets women to
acceptthemselves fullyin spite of any achievement shortcomings ordisapproval
Women
167

they may receive. He teaches women how not to upset themselves too much
about unfairness and unequal treatment in comparison with men.
While recognizing that women may have additional or different hardships to
men in seeking advancement, Ellis encourages women to accept (not like) the
signiﬁcant frustrations they face and to work hard at overcoming them.
In the transcript which follows, Robin, a 36-year-old unmarried middle-
management executive, reveals how much RET has helped her in overcoming
her anxieties, periodic bouts of depression, and defensiveness at work.
ELLIS:
How are things with you?
ROBIN:
Everything is much, much better.
ELLIS:
Yes, you look alright.
ROBIN:
The anxiety thing has never come back. In fact, the manager hasn’t
really given me such a hard time any more.
ELLIS:
Right, probably because you’re taking it well.
ROBIN:
He told me yesterday that I seem happier. And I’m ﬁnding that when
I use these rational ideas they act like magic. I enjoy having meetings
now and I don’t see the same things as problems. I laugh and I’m
creative. It’s just incredible!
ELLIS:
It shows you what you were doing to make yourself anxious.
ROBIN:
And what I was doing to make myself anxious for so long.
ELLIS:
That’s right. And you’re very bright so you’re coming through in
spite of your anxiety. So, now you’ll come through much better
without it.
ROBIN:
Yes, even in meetings. It’s incredible how crippled I was, in a sense,
and still able to function. Now I just come up with ideas and I don’t
know where they come from, it’s terriﬁc.
ELLIS:
Right.
ROBIN:
This is interesting. A vice-president is coming to visit us and it’s a big
deal. And out of over 40 people they picked three people to interview
him and I’m one of them. They always do that. Now before I would
have thought “Aren’t I terriﬁc” and I would have gone on a high with
that.
ELLIS:
But you’d be on a low if it didn’t happen. You see, whenever you get
those highs, then you’re preparing yourself for a later anxious time.
ROBIN:
I would always look around for things to support me to say how great
I was.
ELLIS:
That’s like saying “Oh, I look great today, I’m a noble person,” but
then tomorrow when you look bleary eyed, you’re back to thinking
you’re a shit.
ROBIN:
I ﬁnd this is like a whole new way of life for me. I don’t know how
many years I’ve been doing this. I had one really interesting thing
happen and that was when they moved my ofﬁce. I was out of the
mainstream that was good. And in my work, there was all of a sudden
somehow less tension and excitement. And I almost began to sink
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
168

into depression. So what I said to myself was “It’s just sort of boring
and lonely today.” And it only lasted one night.
ELLIS:
That’s right.
ROBIN:
Anditworked.Itworkedforthatnightandthenextdayatworkitwas
busier but I was afraid maybe now because I was out of a tension
situation that I’d go back into depression.
ELLIS:
But, again, it was only boring and inconvenient and if you got in a
depression it would only be boring and inconvenient. Nothing is the
end of the world, you see.
ROBIN:
I tell you that is the greatest philosophy I’ve ever come across. I just
seemtoenjoy everything.Ithinkinonebookyouwrotehownottobe
unhappy; that’s really cute, you’re not always in the dumps. A couple
of things I’d like to talk about today. Sometimes people come in to
talk with me and some of them make me feel uncomfortable.
ELLIS:
Because they do what? What do they do before you start feeling
uncomfortable?
ROBIN:
I guess they don’t do anything. I feel that there’s an expectation or,
I don’t know what it is.
ELLIS:
Yes, you do. You’re viewing it in some way. That they’re asking
something of you. What’s your view?
ROBIN:
Well, sometimes they’re uncomfortable and that makes me
uncomfortable.
ELLIS:
Ah! That’s the answer to that. At “A,” they’re uncomfortable. Now at
“C” you’re uncomfortable. What’s “B?” What are you telling yourself
about their discomfort to make you uncomfortable?
ROBIN:
I guess I’m saying because they’re uncomfortable. I should be
uncomfortable.
ELLIS:
Let’sgobackalittle.Areyousaying“Ineedthemtobeuncomfortable,
as I shouldn’t.”
ROBIN:
Ah!
ELLIS:
Ah!
ROBIN:
So? Because I’m the boss, right?
ELLIS:
There must be something about ME that makes them uncomfortable
and so I shouldn’t have that thing. Isn’t that it?
ROBIN:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Now did you make them uncomfortable?
ROBIN:
I didn’t, I didn’t do anything. I am just in a position.
ELLIS:
And even if you did something the previous time to them, you were
critical or something like that, did that make them uncomfortable or
did they make themselves uncomfortable about that?
ROBIN:
They made themselves uncomfortable.
ELLIS:
That’s right, you see. You could have been a pain in the ass, you
could have been overly critical, nasty, mean, etc., that’s possible.
And then they make themselves uncomfortable. But, now let’s
suppose the worst, that you really did act badly toward them
Women
169

previously to this current time. That would have been wrong
behavior on your part and you better acknowledge that “I’m doing
something that they make themselves uncomfortable about. Maybe
I’d better stop that.” But still, there is no reason why you shouldn’t
have done that wrong behavior. It’s just undesirable. But you should
do undesirable behavior. Do you know why you should?
ROBIN:
You mean in relation to them?
ELLIS:
Yes, let’s suppose previous to this time you acted very badly to them
and you’re saying to yourself “Oh shit, I acted badly I shouldn’t have
acted that way.”
ROBIN:
What do you mean, badly?
ELLIS:
You were overly critical or something like that. Youshould have acted
that way. Do you know why you should have?
ROBIN:
No.
ELLIS:
Because you did. It’s very simple. Anything you do, you do, you must
have, should have, done. There is no other possibility.
ROBIN:
And if it happened, that’s the way I behaved.
ELLIS:
You were wrong in acting that way, but you should have been wrong.
Were you wrong? You’re saying “I shouldn’t have been wrong.” But
you should have been. How could you be right when you were wrong?
You see?
ROBIN:
I’m ﬁnding that I’ve been doing this all the time, ﬁghting things that
exist and there’s nothing you can do about it. I think that’s what
you’re saying is that we wind up with the same kind of turmoil.
ELLIS:
Well, there is nothing you can do about that past behavior but you
couldnowstopfeelinguncomfortable,stopputtingyourselfdown,and
then say “OK, maybe I’d better treat them more gently or whatever.”
You could try to do something about it. Now maybe you can’t because
they might become scared only because you’re called The Boss.
ROBIN:
Right.
ELLIS:
Or because you are a woman. You see you have two factors. One,
you’re the boss, and, two, you’re a woman. Well, you’re not going to
change beingtheboss andyou’re not goingtochangebeing awoman.
Therefore, you might never be able to make them more comfortable.
ROBIN:
Some of them used to be just a little bit too close and I told them I was
angry about it and we were going to have to move.
ELLIS:
That’s another thing. A good thing you pointed out. Another reason
they’re uncomfortable with you is that you’re somewhat removed
from them. You’re acting in a capable, efﬁcient manner, rather than
being one of them. Now, it’s true you could act differently and be like
them but then that might not be good for other reasons. See what I
mean?
ROBIN:
I may lose some control, yes.
ELLIS:
It’s like the army, which has had a rule for many years, and they still
have it as far as I know, that ofﬁcers do not fraternize with people
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
170

under them because they ﬁnd that if they fraternize, then when they
come to shoot somebody they don’t do it. You see?
ROBIN:
Mmm.
ELLIS:
It’s a disadvantage and an advantage for the ofﬁcers not to fraternize.
The disadvantage is that the non-commissioned people are scared of
the ofﬁcers but the advantage is they follow their orders. They act
presumably, more efﬁciently.
ROBIN:
Yes, that’s the wayI think, you know, that I had betternot be too close
with them.
ELLIS:
But, that may be wise.
ROBIN:
I think for me it is.
ELLIS:
And, maybe, for them. They’ll act more efﬁciently but they’ll also,
maybe, be somewhat scared. You may just have to live with it.
ROBIN:
I’ll have to make myself more comfortable with them.
ELLIS:
That’s right. You think to yourself, “OK, they’re scared and I’m going
to accept the fact that they’re going to be uncomfortable.”
ROBIN:
I ﬁnd that as I get more into this and I’m more myself I’m more
relaxed. I’ve never laughed this much thislast week as I have for years.
Then in turn they laugh.
ELLIS:
That’s right
ROBIN:
We get some of that going but there’s still always that distance and
maybe that is supposed to be there. Maybe that will never go away.
ELLIS:
That’s right and maybe if it did it might be unwise.
ROBIN:
In fact because I’m looking differently at meetings as I was telling
you, rather than being on the defensive about things and maybe
getting my boss angry at me, I see things so clearly that he even
laughed abouthow I had somebody up against the ropesand he kept
kidding me about it all day. He said “Well, you found the opening,
you really had the guy and I had to rescue him.” So he’s really seeing
me differently but it’s really because I’m able to internalize a lot of
this philosophy.
ELLIS:
That’s right. You’re using it, internalizing it, acting on it, and it gets
more and more automatic.
ROBIN:
It’s wonderful. It’s like a whole new way of life for me. You’re saying it
gets more automatic.
ELLIS:
It gets more automatic. Lots of times you will be automatically
thinking “OK, that’s their problem,” you see, and you won’t even
have to think about it.
ROBIN:
I told you I used to put my foot down all the time because I never got
married. I don’t even think about that. I mean I really can adjust and
enjoy, it’s wonderful. I can’t believe it. I’m so grateful and relieved.
Ellis promotes a concept of equality between the sexes. REBT helps women to
examine the, oftentimes, pernicious effects of sex-role stereotyping on their
mental health by helping women dispute what they (and society) think they

should be. Ellis offers women a means for helping them bring about the personal
changes that will help them develop their full potential as human beings.
Programs for Women
Ellis has always recognized that given the unique upbringing of women, women
may require therapeutic programs and psycho-educational materials that are
different from men (for example, he wrote, in 1979, the extremely popular The
Intelligent Woman’s Guide to Mating and Dating (Secaucus, NJ: Lyle Stuart)).
As a consequence, Ellis has actively encouraged the setting-up of a women’s
program within the Institute of Rational-Emotive Therapy. And over the past
decade, the Institute has developed one of the most innovative and exciting
programs for women in the United States.
Some of the group programs offered at the Albert Ellis Institute have included
women’s assertiveness, effectiveness, and sexuality groups, workshops dealing
with life-cycle change and career entry, weight and stress management work-
shops, workshops dealing with mother–daughter communication, and all-
women therapy groups.
The staff at the Institute not only offer a variety of programs for women, but
also travel across the United States conducting workshops for professionals in
sex-roleissuesintherapy,engageincollaborativeprojectswithvariouswomen’s
organizations (including the National Organization for Women).
Through experience, the Institute has found that women are more likely to
receive positive reinforcement for their departures from “feminine” behavior
and increased independence in all-women therapy groups. The key ingredients
in REBT women’s groups include consciousness raising through discussion
groups and feminist literature; goal setting to reduce dependency and to deﬁne
own life goals; REBT which helps women change an “I’m helpless” belief system
to one of optimism and self-acceptance; assertiveness training which helps
women take risks and cope with the possible negative consequences that
may occur as a result of their assertions; positive self-messages where women
are taught to focus on their positive traits; self-pleasuring assignments designed
to reinforce the idea that “I have a right to do nice things for myself”;
encouragement of female relationships where women are helped to appreciate
and value the love, caring, and nurturance which they can receive from female
friends; focus on environmental resources and societal change which involves
showing women how to use community resources and organizations (women’s
shelters, women’s professional organizations, non-sexist gynecologists), and
problem solving for dealing with problems, and achieving their goals.

Homosexuality
Humans are born with a pluri-sexual disposition and there is nothing
unusual about seeking satisfaction with males as well as with females. The
homosexual’s and the heterosexual’s abnormality is not that they want sex
relations with members of their own sex, but that they erroneously believe
that they must have such relations, and that they cannot enjoy other kinds
of sex.6
Ellis has vast experience in working with gay people who seek therapy for
emotional problems that may or may not be connected with their homosexuali-
ty.Healsohasseenmanygaypeoplewhowishtochangetheirsexualpreferences
into a heterosexual one. During the 1950s and through the mid-1960s, he
reviewed much of the scientiﬁc research and writing on homosexuality. His
book, Homosexuality, which was published in 1965, summarized his insights.
Irrationality and Homosexuality
Forty years ago, Ellis viewed a great deal of homosexual behavior as irrational.
He saw it as irrational because of the heavy societal penalties and personal costs
associated with its practice. Consistent with REBT principles which state that
people who engage in any behavior which has self-defeating consequences are
almostalways acting irrationally, Ellisviewed homosexual behavior –especially,
given people’s apparent choice of sexual preference – as frequently harmful to
the welfare and freedom of the homosexual person.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness: The Legacy of Albert Ellis
 Michael E. Bernard
Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

In his book, Ellis dismissed the evidence that people are born homosexual or
heterosexual. Instead, he argued that people are horn with an ambi-sexual
tendency which allows them to be raised to be heterosexuals in most instances,
butwhichissufﬁcientlyﬂexibletopermithomosexualitytodevelopundersome
conditions and circumstances.
Here’s how he summarizes his position in 1965 writing in his book
Homosexuality.
There are many environmental or psychological reasons why individuals
whom one would normally expect to be heterosexual or at best bisexual,
tend to become mainly or exclusively homosexual.6
Ellis has asserted that the environment in which children are raised can
inﬂuenceachild’slatersexualpreference.Someofthefactorsinthechild’shome
environment and experience which Ellis suggests may act to condition a child
towards homosexuality include: being raised to hate members of the opposite
sex, having unpleasant experiences with members of the opposite sex, being
raised exclusively by members of the opposite sex, having one’s ﬁrst satisfying
relation with a member of one’s own sex, ﬁnding it difﬁcult in competing for
heterosexual favors, and having early traumatizing heterosexual experiences.
However, according to Ellis, what is more important than speciﬁc environ-
mental conditions in “causing” homosexuality are children’s general psycho-
logical disposition towards experiencing emotional problems and their
psychological tendency to be inﬂuenced by speciﬁc environmental experiences.
Ellis argues for psychological conditionability in light of the relatively small
proportion of children who are exposed to conditions at home which are likely
to condition homosexuality (e.g. weak father, dominating mother) and who
actually become homosexual. Ellis believed that homosexual people who never
contemplateorattempttoexperienceheterosexualrelations(Ellisreferstothem
as “ﬁxed” or “conﬁrmed” homosexuals) allow themselves to be conditioned
mono-sexually even though they have the power to ﬁght their conditioning.
The other main reason why Ellis believes that some homosexual behavior is
irrational is that it can be motivated by irrational feelings and beliefs. For
example, Ellis asserts that some homosexuals he has seen are attracted to other
homosexuals because they ﬁnd it easier to have satisfying sex and to be accepted
and loved in the gay community and ﬁnd heterosexual contact “too difﬁcult”
and risky. Their anxiety about heterosexual contact arises from their irrational
beliefs that “I must be successful in dating for me to be worthwhile” and “I need
tobelovedandcouldn’tstandtoberejected.”Additionally,theirlowfrustration
tolerance which prevents them from putting in the hard and, often times,
unrewarded work in heterosexual contact, stems from the irrational ideas that
“Finding a love partner and having sex shouldn’t be this hard” and “I shouldn’t
have to do anything unpleasant nor hard in order to obtain satisfying love and
sexual relations.”
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
174

Another irrationality which, according to Ellis, can interfere with a gay
person’s desire to participate more heterosexually is an underlying feeling of
inadequacy and undeservingness because of their homosexual behavior. As will
be illustrated later in this chapter, many homosexual people who desire
heterosexual contact put themselves down because of their homosexuality.
Feelings of inadequacy reduce a person’s conﬁdence to take the necessary risks
associated with trying out new patterns of social and sexual behavior.
At the time Ellis wrote his book on homosexuality, he believed that any gay
person who from an early age only had sex with members of his or her sex, and
who rigidly refused to consider the possibility of having, at least, bisexual
relations had emotional problems. The obsessional nature of anyone’s ﬁxation
on members of his own or her own sex was seen by Ellis as an outcome of
psychological vulnerability to environmental conditions and associated feelings
of inadequacy, anxiety, and anger.
Ellis accepts that humans are basically bisexual and, as a consequence, views
people who are compulsively homosexual or heterosexual, and who under all
conditions (e.g., being in prison, on an island with same sex or opposite sex
people) refuse to entertain the idea that they can enjoy sex in more than one way
are irrational and somewhat disturbed in thinking. Ellis believes that anyone
who chooses his or her sexual objects in an absolutistic, obsessive-compulsive
manner is unhealthy.
And because in contemporary society, gay people can exist quite happily,
Ellis no longer considers homosexuality as being as irrational as it once was.
As you’ll see in the interview, Ellis’ position on homosexuality is that it’s
quite rational and healthy for people to be primarily homosexual in
orientation.
And Ellis also considers homophobic heterosexuals who are horriﬁed at
the thought of homosexuality and would not under any conditions try it, as
distinctly disturbed not because they like heterosexuality, but because they
will not consider any other possibility, and are rigid and bigoted against
homosexuals. In his 1976 book, Sex and the Liberated Man, Ellis writes:
I ﬁnd that as we – meaning heterosexual society – take more liberal
attitudes toward ﬁxed homosexuals and allow them to do what they want
with their sex lives, with a minimum of interference and persecution, the
happier and less disturbed they seem to feel and behave. Also, as gay
liberation has again pointed out, more homosexuals today seem to choose
their way of life on a preferential, rather than on a compulsive, rigidly
ﬁxed, basis; and as I have noted above, people who preferentially choose a
mode of sex behavior, even though it seems strange and different to the
majority of individuals in a given culture, may have little or no emotional
disturbance. They may merely behave peculiarly rather than aberrantly . . .
And more psychotherapists, most of them heterosexual, now treat
homosexual clients for all kinds of sexual and nonsexual problems
without considering their homophilism as one of these problems and
Homosexuality
175

without trying to convert them to heterosexuality . . . My philosophy
almost exactly follows, as it has for many years, that of Identity House, a
counseling center in New York speciﬁcally designed to serve the gay and
bisexual community. Its philosophy bases itself on “the ideal that one’s
sexual identity should be a freely chosen expression of that which is most
natural to and rewarding for each individual.” Well stated! . . .
Sexual sanity (like nonsexual sanity), then, largely consists of non-
compulsiveness, of personal experimentation, of open-mindedness, of
sticking to pathways that do not entail too many practical disadvan-
tages, and perhaps above all, of accepting yourself and utterly refusing
to down yourself even if you do the wrong thing and indubitably behave
self-defeatingly . . . Your acts, when you are rigid and compulsive, may
be foolish; but you are never a fool or “a louse or a worm or a rotten
person”! For you exist as an ongoing process, an individual who, at any
age, can change remarkably. And you (or anyone) cannot legitimately
rate the process of your “you-ness,” your living humanity. Remember
that!12
REBT Counseling
REBT is being used with those people who want help in: (1) overcoming
emotional problems which are frequently but not always associated with their
homosexuality, (2) becoming more heterosexual in orientation, and (3) ridding
themselves of their compulsive homosexual behavior and lifestyle.
The general approach Ellis adopts with clients who are gay is to help them
overcome any guilt and depression they may experience. He ﬁrst shows that
there is no need for them to be guilty about their homophilism since at the very
worst it is a self-defeating form of behavior (rather than a heinously immoral
act)andthereisnoreasonwhytheyhavetocondemn themselvesformakingany
mistake.
Once he has helped a gay client to engage in homosexual acts in a non-guilty
manner, he goes on to teach them in good REBT fashion that they had better
never condemn themselves for any error or wrongdoing they may perform.
In working with people who wish to become more heterosexual, he shows how
they can put up with any kind of rejection – particularly by females – and that
rejection hardly means they are worthless or reprehensible.
Ellis assumes that for a minority of gay people, the fear of failing is one of the
primary causes of their avoidance of female contact. For these people, Ellis is
very active and forceful in trying to help them establish heterosexual involve-
ments. He sets behavioral homework assignments where a client agrees to
engage in a variety of heterosexual behaviors from calling up a female for a date
in the early stages to having intercourse after some conﬁdence has been
established in heterosexual contacts.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
176

Ellis challenges a person to take the risks of social rejection and prove to
him or herself that even if they are not successful, it hardly proves they can’t
stand rejection, or that they are hopeless people because of it. Throughout
therapy sessions, Ellis continuously zeros in on people’s initial inability to
tolerate the frustration and discomfort that’s associated with the hard work of
establishing a satisfactory love and sex relationship with a female. He stresses
the importance of work and effort in the adaptation of a new sexual
orientation.
In the therapy session that follows, Ellis demonstrates the REBT method with
Roy, a 26-year-old client who is gay, works in a restaurant and is quite successful
and popular as the headwaiter and ﬁll-in bartender. He has read Ellis’ work and
approached Ellis to see if he could help him become more heterosexual.
ELLIS:
Make yourselfcomfortable. I’lltaketheﬁrstsheet ofthat form,theface

ROY:
It’s not totally ﬁnished.
ELLIS:
That’s okay. You’ll get it back. Now, which of my books referred you
here?
ROY:
The book that caught my attention was called Homosexuality.
ELLIS:
Okay. (reading from form) “I have a problem with homosexuality
which I have tried to get rid of for many years.” What’s your problem
with the homosexuality?
ROY:
Well, I don’t like being a homosexual.
ELLIS:
And when did you start being gay?
ROY:
When I was eighteen.
ELLIS:
And what happened to get you into it?
ROY:
WhenIwentoverseasattheendofhighschool.Imetsomeguysonthis
tour I was on and started having sex with them.
ELLIS:
And how was the sex?
ROY:
At the moment it was good. But then later on I would feel like it wasn’t
right.
ELLIS:
Did you put yourself down? Did you blame yourself?
ROY:
Yes. I did blame myself because I was brought up to believe that
homosexuality was not right.
ELLIS:
Okay. You had sex and enjoyed it when you were young but you didn’t
like yourself for having it. Right?
ROY:
Yes.AndnowIhavethesestrongdesires,feelingsinmymind,andIwill

person because after I ﬁnished screwing them, I would always feel that
it wasn’t right. I always feel that it would be nice at the time. But then
after it is over I feel that the desires would come again in my mind.
ELLIS:
And is the sex still okay.
ROY:

177

ELLIS:
And did you have any long relationships?
ROY:
Yes. I went with this guy for a couple of months.
ELLIS:
And why did it end?
ROY:
Because we just wanted to be friends and have sex, but it wasn’t love.
ELLIS:
But you were good friends. And did you go with any women during
this time? Did you date girls?
ROY:
No.
ELLIS:
Not at all? Because?
ROY:
The only girls I dated was when I was in school. I did date this girl
several years ago.
ELLIS:
How old were you?
ROY:
It must have been about 4 years ago.
ELLIS:
Yes. So you were about 22. How did you meet her?
ROY:
We worked in the same restaurant.
ELLIS:
How old was she?
ROY:
She was my age. She was attracted to me and I didn’t know she liked
me. But we got to know each other and became friends and we talked.
We shared personal things. We had personalities in common.
ELLIS:
Yeah.
ROY:
She used to tell me she didn’t believe I was gay. She used to say I had
strong feelings and cried because of the way my family was and not
because I was gay. I used to agree with her.
ELLIS:
Right.
ROY:
She wanted to get together and have a relationship. But while I liked
her, she wasn’t my type of woman.
ELLIS:
She wasn’t that attractive to you.
ROY:
No. She had beautiful eyes, but her body was a general type of body.
ELLIS:
Some women’s bodies turn you on?
ROY:
Yes.
ELLIS:
But not that one. So you didn’t have any sex with her.
ROY:
Well,wehadsexbutitwasterrible.Weusedtogotoherplaceandsleep

ELLIS:
Did you get an erection?
ROY:
Yes. Then one night we went out to have a couple of drinks and we
came over to her house. And then we started to massage each other
and relax and she turned me on. But she was the one who made the
ﬁrst move. I had an erection but I tried to avoid it every time. It was
like I felt ashamed.
ELLIS:
Why did you feel ashamed to have an erection with a woman?
ROY:
I don’t know.
ELLIS:
But you did have intercourse with her?
ROY:
Yes, we tried, but we never ﬁnished.
ELLIS:
Because, why didn’t you ﬁnish? You got an erection?
ROY:
I got an erection and she went down on me. And then when I tried to
penetrate her I freaked out.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
178

ELLIS:
Was she a virgin?
ROY:
No.
ELLIS:
So you couldn’t get it in.
ROY:
It was my ﬁrst time. I freaked out.
ELLIS:
And you never tried again.
ROY:
No.
ELLIS:
So you didn’t persist. And with any other women, did you ever have
sex?
ROY:
No. My last year at high school I had a girlfriend. I would get very
excited but at that time I was a member of the church and it wasn’t
allowed for us to have relations.
ELLIS:
Wasn’t that one of the reasons you didn’t go out with women, because
you were religious at that time?
ROY:
No, mainly at that time, I wanted to go out with girls but I just was
afraid.
ELLIS:
Afraid that you wouldn’t succeed.
ROY:
Right.
ELLIS:
With both of the women you were able to get aroused but never really
hadintercoursewith,youwereafraid.Didyouevergotoprostitutesor
anything like that?
ROY:
No.
ELLIS:
Right. But if you went with an attractive woman who liked you, you
could get aroused and could have sex with her. Now what stops you
from ﬁnding an attractive woman and having sex?
ROY:
I feel like I’m very insecure.
ELLIS:
You mean you’re going to fail. What do you mean by insecure?
ROY:
I work with women during the day. I work in a restaurant.
ELLIS:
And some of them are interested in you?
ROY:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Alright. Now why wouldn’t you go out with one of them and try to go
to bed with her? An attractive one. What stops you?
ROY:
I feel like I’m worthless.
ELLIS:
But why are you worthless? What makes you worthless?
ROY:
Because in my mind I think I’m a homosexual, worthless, and I don’t
deserve a woman.
ELLIS:
How does that follow?
ROY:
I don’t know.
ELLIS:
You see, even if we could prove you’re doing the wrong thing by being
with guys, it’s just an error you’re making. And that never makes you a
bad or undeserving person. Are you still going to school? And how are
you doing at school?
ROY:
Pretty good.
ELLIS:
And your job is okay?
ROY:
Yeah.
Homosexuality
179

ELLIS:
And what do you want to be when you ﬁnish school? Is there anything
you want to do in life?
ROY:
I would like to open my own business.
ELLIS:
Restaurant or what?
ROY:
Idon’treallyknow.Maybemyownrestaurantorbeamanagerforabig

ELLIS:
The point is we all do some good things and some bad things. But how
does it make us bad people when we do bad, stupid things. How does
that follow?
ROY:
It’s like, I feel insecure. I feel I’ll never succeed.
ELLIS:
But that’s putting yourself down. You’re saying “I’m a bad person, I’m
worthless.”Well,aslongasyousay“I’mworthless,I’mworthless”how
can you succeed? See, you’re not going to do that. Suppose you had a
friend of yours in your class. You meet a guy in school and he’s your
age, and he’s okay in school. He gets along with people but he’s gay.
Now do you think he’s worthless because he is gay?
ROY:
No. I don’t.
ELLIS:
Why are you then?
ROY:
I don’t feel like I’m worthless in society. I feel like I don’t deserve –.
ELLIS:
But what makes you undeserving? What do you have to do to be
deserving and to deserve a good life? What do you have to do?
ROY:
Well, like maybe if I was making good money and could take her to
a restaurant, a play, buy her things. I would feel more secure.
ELLIS:
So you’re saying “If I succeed that’s okay, but if I fail I’m a worm.” You
see that’s your problem. You’re putting yourself down. It’s nice to
succeed, it’s nice to do all those things you want to do. But it doesn’t
make you a good person. And it doesn’t make you a bad person when
you don’t succeed. It makes you a person who has not succeeded. And
you are jumping to: “My acts, my performances are not so good and
therefore, I am no good!” That doesn’t follow. Do you see that doesn’t
follow.Supposeyougooutofhere,whichIusuallyaskpeople,andyou
go out on the streets of New York and you see a child running under a
car and almost getting killed. You run under the car and save the child
even at the risk of your life. Now is that a good deed?
ROY:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
Does that make you a good person?
ROY:
Yes it does.
ELLIS:
How does it? How does doing one good deed make you good?
ROY:
It makes you a better person.
ELLIS:
No, it makes you a person who did a good deed. Because the next
minute you might kill some people. Nobody is a good or bad person.
Wearepeoplewhodogooddeedsandbaddeeds.Welegitimatelycan’t

Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
180

ELLIS:
What do you mean, good character?
ROY:
Yes, I like to help people, do things for people.
ELLIS:
Right, but what’s the “but?”
ROY:
The “but” is that I’m gay.
ELLIS:
Right. But we’re assuming that that’s a poor trait. Even if we could
prove that – which we really can’t – how does one poor trait make you
worthless? You see? Suppose you give up being gay and you start going
to bed with women and they like you and you succeed very well with
them. How does that make you a good person if you do that?
ROY:
Well, I can be with people.
ELLIS:
You can be with people now.
ROY:
Yes, but it’s not the same.
ELLIS:
Well, because you’re putting yourself down. That’s why it’s not the
same. Lots of gay people are much happier than you are. Now, how
come?
ROY:
Because they accept their homosexuality. I have never accepted my
homosexuality.
ELLIS:
Yes they accept themselves. Some of them don’t even like their
homosexuality, but they accept themselves with the homosexuality.
ROY:
What I ﬁnd is that I don’t accept my own homosexuality. I never did.
ELLIS:
No, you don’t have to. But, if you don’t stop putting yourself down,
then you probably won’t be able to change it. First, accept you with the
homosexuality, then you can do almost anything you like. But as long
as you say “I’m worthless,” “I’m no good,” “I’m insecure,” how is that
going to help you?
ROY:
I am working on that. I’m better than I was. I feel better than I felt a few
years ago.
ELLIS:
Because, what did you do to feel better?
ROY:
I stopped taking drugs and going to gay bars. I stopped all of that. I
don’t have any gay friends right now. Just a few gay people that I know.
ELLIS:
Yes. But you still seem to be saying, “I’m worthless and don’t deserve
a woman.” Now, there’s no reason you aren’t deserving of a woman.
And some women are obviously attracted to you, right? You’re a nice
looking guy. You can get plenty of women if you want them. But
only if you stop putting yourself down and risk it and risk it. You’re
afraid of failing. And if you go out with ten women, some of them
won’t like you at all, some you’ll succeed with, some you’ll fail with.
And you’re afraid to risk that. Now, if we can get you to go with
women, make passes at them, and not put yourself down when
someone rejects you, then you will start enjoying heterosexuality and
get along in life. But ﬁrst you’d better work on accepting you; that’s
what you’re not doing. And don’t accept yourself because you’ve got
off drugs or because you’ve stopped the gay life. Accept yourself
because you are alive, because you’re human. All humans can accept
Homosexuality
181

themselves, even when they’re screwing up. You see what I mean?
And you’re saying “Oh, no, I can only accept myself if I stop screwing
up.” But you’ll always screw up to some degree. Do you know why
you will?
ROY:
No.
ELLIS:
Because you’re a fallible human. All humans screw up much of the
time. That is their nature. They’re all fallible. None of them is perfect.
And you’re saying “I have to do the right thing to accept myself.”
Instead of “I’d like to do the right thing, but if I don’t I’m not going to
put myself down. I’m just going to work harder to do the right thing
next time. I’m not going to cop out.” You see, you’re copping out with
women.
ROY:
It’s like I want to go out with a woman but can’t.
ELLIS:
Because, what are you afraid of? Let’s be honest.
ROY:
Failure.
ELLIS:
That’s right. You’re saying, “If I fail, I am a failure, with a capital F.”
Instead of, “If I fail, good! I’ll learn by trial and error. I’ll practice,
practice, practice, and ﬁnally do better.”
ROY:
Right.
ELLIS:
Edison failed 799 times with the electric bulb. The 800th time he
succeeded. Now how many times have you tried?
ROY:
Not much.
ELLIS:
You see, you gave up. Edison would never have succeeded had he had
your philosophy. And he also failed with the movie. He didn’t invent
the movie. Pathe beat him to it. Then he took his own recording
machine, the “Ediphone,” and together with Pathe’s ﬁlm, he made
the ﬁrst talking picture. But it didn’t work very well and 20 years later
someone else had to re-invent it. So Edison didn’t succeed all the
time. But he didn’t put himself down the way you do. That’s why he
was able to keep persisting.
ROY:
I don’t want to put myself down.
ELLIS:
You do it because you have the philosophy “I must do well or else I’m
no good!” “I must succeed or I’m worthless.”
ROY:
When you grow up you’re taught to believe that. It’s very hard to get
away from that.
ELLIS:
It’s only hard because you don’t work at it. Now if we can get you to
work at it, work at it, work at it, it would become easier. It is hard in
the beginning. If we can get you to stop demanding that you have to do
well, and start accepting yourself, I can almost guarantee that you’ll
get over your fear of having sex with women if that’s what you want to
do. But if you try several women and you still distinctly prefer men,
that’s okay, too. As long as you don’t think “I’m no good for being
straight!” Once you fully accept yourself, you can choose to be straight
or gay, whichever you really prefer.

AIDS
One of the potential crises in the life of a gay person is the threat of the acquired
immune deﬁciency syndromes (AIDS).
Ellis’ view on AIDS is that one had better not become overly anxious by over-
estimating the likelihood of getting AIDS. He advocates “safe sex” and rather
than dwelling on the real sadness of the loss of friends and the scope of harm,
he encourages gay people to ﬁll their lives with as much fun and happiness as
possible.
In the brief therapy session which follows, Ellis discusses with Stan, a 42-year-
old gay person, his anxieties about AIDS and whether he might be using the
threat of AIDS as an excuse not to date women.
STAN:
Why would I want to get involved with a woman if I felt there was any
reason to be concerned about having AIDS?
ELLIS:
You mean if you had the virus? Then the thing to do honestly is to tell
her “Look, I have the virus and there is only one out of ten chances that
IwillgetAIDSandtheonlywayIwillhavesexwithyouiswhenyou are
very well protected, which means with rubbers and if you are quite
willing to do so.”
STAN:
But the thing is, I don’t want to know if I have AIDS.
ELLIS:
Well, it’s up to you to decide. If I were somebody like you I would want
to know.
STAN:
You would want to know.
ELLIS:
Iwouldalwayswanttoknow.EvenifIhadAIDSIwouldwanttoknow.
STAN:
So would I. If I had AIDS I would jump out the nearest window.
ELLIS:
Well, or enjoy yourself before it starts bothering you.
STAN:
Yeah, but the damnest thing is I don’t know. I don’t want to know
because sometimes I feel like my mind has a lot to do with my physical
being.
ELLIS:
You’re right, you see. But, unfortunately, if you don’t get the test, then
if you get anyone of those AIDS symptoms you will say right away to
yourself“IbetI’vegotAIDS,IbetI’vegotAIDS,”whenyouhaven’tgot
it. I saw a straight guy who went to bed a few weeks ago with a woman
who takes needles. He was married. So he was very worried because he
thought he was going to get AIDS from her. Now, even if she has it,
there is very little chance that he’s going to get it from her. Men
transmit it to women but women apparently rarely transmit it to men.
STAN:
Is that true?
ELLIS:
Yes, it has to be blood to blood because it goes through semen and
blood. If you have AIDS and your semen gets into a woman’s blood
stream you can give it to her. But she has no semen. Theoretically if she
has AIDS and your blood mixes with hers, which would be very
Homosexuality
183

difﬁcultto arrange, thenyoucould get it.Sothereisverylittleevidence
yet that women give it to men. Men are much more likely to give it to
women.
STAN:
So men give it to men only if a man screws another man.
ELLIS:
Yes, usually in anal intercourse.
STAN:
Can the guy who is screwing get AIDS if he has screwed another man?
ELLIS:
No, he wouldn’t normally get it, unless it’s blood to blood, but the guy
who’s being screwed could get it. Because the insertor’s semen could
enter his bloodstream. So if you insert, his semen can’t enter your
bloodstream. If quite unusually you both bleed – suppose your penis
tears and his anus tears, then maybe you can get AIDS. Maybe.
STAN:
But that’s hardly likely.
ELLIS:
Yes, that’s highly unlikely. This straight guy was really up the wall
because suppose he was afraid he would transmit AIDS to his wife.
She didn’t know he had the affair, it was just a one night stand. Then
he took the test and he found he was free from AIDS. He had no virus
or anything. We showed him, in one of my therapy groups, that there
was very little chance of having AIDS and he calmed down. But then
he took the test and now he knows he is perfectly free. So some
people want to take the test to see what their chances are. So you can
take it. You don’t have to, but if you don’t take it then you will worry
about it. And if you do even return positive there is still only one out
of ten chances you will ever get AIDS.
STAN:
Yeah, but if it returns positive and there is still only one of ten chances,
I think I would make my life very miserable for myself, because I
couldn’t bear it.
ELLIS:
Well, you don’t have to depress yourself. You could just say, “I’ve got
nineoutoftenchancesofnotgettingit,soIamgoingtobeashappyasI
can be. If I die, I die!”
STAN:
But that might be the way you would think.
ELLIS:
Well, you could think that way too.
STAN:
After twenty years of homosexual screwing, I don’t know if I could
think that way right now.
ELLIS:
So, therefore, if you don’t want to accept that philosophy, you don’t
have to accept it.
STAN:
Right, but I guess I’m just looking for excuses, that’s what. Maybe
I shouldn’t get involved with women.
ELLIS:
But if you do decide to get involved with women, so far we don’t seem
to have any real cases where screwing women vaginally clearly gave
themAIDS.Ifyouscrewedthemanallythentheymightgetit;butthere
is no clear evidence that vaginal screwing is going to lead to AIDS.
STAN:
Yes.
ELLIS:
So that would be very unlikely, and to make sure you could use a
rubber.
STAN:
Yes. I mean that’s one solution.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
184

ELLIS:
So the main thing again is, if we can get you to see that every time
you’re anxious you’re sneaking in a must. First, you can ﬁght it, by
asking yourself “Where’s the evidence that I must?” The answer is
always the same, “There is no reason why I must do well, must
impress others, must win their love”; second, you can take more risks
that would be your homework. Put in the ad in the personal column,
call women just to see what happens. You may later decide a
particular woman is not for you. So we’re not telling you to marry
her but to take the risks of dating her and possibly being rejected.
STAN:
Take risks? What do you consider risks?
ELLIS:
Risks. Calling a woman is a risk; going to bed with her is a bigger risk.
Suppose you get along with one and want to go to bed with her. That is
a bigger risk.
While Ellis’ views on homosexuality have been frequently misunderstood
and not accepted, he has encouraged for a very long time his fellow
professionals and the general public to accept gay people and not to
condemn or punish them for their acts. And with Ellis’ current view that
it is only one form of homosexuality, the obsessive-compulsive type, which
stems from irrational thinking, and, therefore, is potentially unhealthy, it
would seem that REBT holds a great deal of promise for helping people who
are gay to gain greater insight into and control of their emotions and
behavior. REBT gives people a choice of being less disturbed if they decide to
stay gay or become bisexual or straight. It deals with their real problems; their
self-defeating musts and demands, rather than with the mere direction of
their sexual choices.

Work
I started out as a typist and ﬁle clerk (who also ran errands and swept the
ﬂoor) and ended up as the personnel manager (and, unofﬁcially, as the vice
president). During this decade, I was probably one of the most efﬁcient
men in the business and perhaps the ﬁrm’s main contributor to its
outstanding success: since I did my work beautifully and devised book-
keeping, billing, ﬁling, mail order, and other systems which helped the ﬁrm
enormously and saved literally thousands of hours of time each year for the
president, who was then able to devote his efforts to building up sales.7
You might wonder what possible value Albert Ellis and REBT could have for
people who wish to perform better and to be happier at work. What insights
could one of the world’s most popular forms of counseling and therapy offer to
aid the solving of business problems? As you’ll see, plenty.
Ellis has always had an interest in business and, in particular, making money.
In fact, his ﬁrst university degree was a Bachelor’s in Business Administration
that he received from the City University of New York. Ellis felt that making
money would enable him to achieve sufﬁcient ﬁnancial independence so that
he could pursue his real interest, which was writing. For ten years, while he was
gathering material for some of his future books and while obtaining his
doctorate in clinical psychology, Ellis worked for a moderately large gift and
novelty wholesale house.
While not a businessman, he was the Executive Director of the Albert Ellis
Institute (formerly the Institute for Rational-Emotive Therapy), an operation

which employs many professionals and administrative personnel, serves thou-
sands of people and, in the process, takes in and spends hundreds of thousands
of dollars each year.
One of the main reasons Ellis’ views are good for business is his emphasis on
efﬁciency. REBT is directed at helping people overcome inefﬁcient ways of
handling their problems at work, the emotional hang-ups they have about these
problems (hostility, anxiety, depression), and how to reduce the inevitable and,
potentially, overwhelming amounts of job-related stress. REBT is particularly
suited to solving one of the main obstacles to success at work, namely,
procrastination.
Out of Ellis’ personal counseling experiences with countless business people
(including leaders of industry and government) have emerged a good many
rationalideas and principles. These can beapplied by allwho wantto work more
effectively and to overcome emotional stresses which otherwise might impede
their job success.
In the later part of the twentieth century, a brand of REBT emerged in its
application to the world of work. Rational Effectiveness Training was developed
by Ellis and colleagues (for example, Dominic DiMattia) and involved teaching
people without mental health problems how to use the ABC-DE model, how to
increase their personal productivity and manage stress at work.
Emotional Problems about Practical Problems at Work
The prelude to controlling organizational processes is exerting a large
degree of self-regulation.7
There continue to be many excellent books appearing on how to succeed at
work. The authors of these books have as their assumption that the main
obstacle to success at work can be overcome through helping you acquire
practical problem-solving skills such as time-management, goal setting, dealing
with difﬁcult people, using the phone effectively, on-the-job assertion, etc.
These practical skills are seen as the keys to unlocking your presumed unlimited
potential for achievement.
Ellis maintains that the experts in the area fail to take into account the
inherent limitations of all of us and, in particular, our irrational tendencies,
which predispose us to inefﬁciency and to being unable to carry through fully
the practical suggestions of the authorities in the ﬁeld. That is, it is not an
inconsiderate boss, difﬁcult customers, tedious or hard work, nor the unrea-
sonable demands of the job, which prevent you from working efﬁciently and
achieving goals. Rather, it is the reactions you have to these practical problems,
which prevents you from solving them. A basic assumption of REBT is that
when you are overly upset about any work problem it is very difﬁcult to do
anything constructive to solve it.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
188

Let’s take a concrete example to show how irrational thinking about events
and people at work can lead to extreme emotional consequences, which, in turn,
generate work behavior that is self-defeating.
Max Richards, 34 years of age, has worked for the Capricorn Insurance
Company for eight years and has a proven sales record. Each year including
the present one which has just ended, Max has qualiﬁed for the highly
competitive end of year free convention holiday which is awarded by
Capricorn to those sales representatives who sell a certain number of policies
each year and over a certain premium. The criterion for required sales and
premiums upon which the free holiday is awarded is reviewed each year by
Capricorn and for the present year was raised a signiﬁcant amount over the
previous year.
Capricorn assured its sales force that it would not make a similar jump in its
sales’ expectations for the following year. However, upon returning from
holidays Max along with the rest of the sales force was informed by the
company’s sales manager that as a result of its decision to go after a greater
share of the total insurance market, there will be for the forthcoming year an
even greater increase in the amount of sales required for the bonus holiday than
occurred for the previous year. The sales manager explained to Max privately
that while he disagreed with this decision, he publicly would have to back
Capricorn’s decision to the fullest without communicating any of his concerns
to upper level management.
Atthispoint,whichElliscallsthe“A,”theActivatingEvent,Maxappearstobe
treatedunfairlybyhiscompany,andinsomewayhissalesmanagerappearstobe
conspiring with the unfairness. Now at “E,” his Emotional Consequences,
Max could feel anything from irritation and displeasure to extreme anger and
rage. What are the behavioral consequences of these two different emotional
reactions? As you would predict, extreme anger could lead to Max engaging in a
variety of aggressive and negative actions towards his manager (whom he likes)
and his company (which he also likes), including stirring up trouble with his
fellow workers, bad mouthing company ofﬁcials, refusing to work for the
bonus, and, perhaps, either quitting or being ﬁred. This pattern of behavior
would be irrational because it would work against Max’s long-term goals of
being ﬁnancially well off and developing a reputation in the industry as a “super
agent.” And Max’s decision to stay with Capricorn had better be made by him in
a state other than rage.
Irritation and displeasure on the other hand are appropriate negative feelings
about the company’s actions. Why appropriate?
Well, it certainly would be surprising if Max were to feel sublimely happy
when his company acts in what appears to be its own rather than his interest.
With Max feeling only irritated and displeased, he is still in control of himself
in the situation and, therefore, apt to behave in ways which will not be self-
defeating.
Byrefusingtobecomeenraged,Maxisinafarbetterpositiontocommunicate
his legitimate feelings about Capricorn’s decision. This would have a much
Work
189

greater likelihood of inﬂuencing his company’s policy than if he acted
aggressively.
In addition, Max’s relative calm would enable him to weigh up objectively
the total range of plusses and minuses of the job before deciding to change
jobs.
For Max to stay in control emotionally, his rational thinking or Rational
Beliefs (Bs) about his company’s decision could be, “It is unfair that Capricorn
reversed its previous decision. I certainly wish it would be more consistent and
considerate. And it would have been better if my sales manager didn’t give in or
agree to all company decisions. This is a royal pain because I’ll really have to
work unbelievably hard this year to achieve my goals. While the decision is a bad
one, this is not the worst thing that could ever happen. I can hack it and make
next year’s sales level if I choose to.”
If he stayed rigorously only with these rational beliefs, he would feel
displeased, disappointed, and, perhaps, disillusioned with his job and the
sales manager. And as a result of these feelings, he might try to correct the
company’s decision or leave his job. But he would not be terribly upset,
unless he started to think irrationally, “Isn’t it awful that this happened to
me! It’s totally unfair that this occurred and things must not be so unfair.
And the sales manager, too. He should stand up for himself. What a hopeless
character he is! I can’t stand working any longer for such an inferior person
let alone this totally rotten company! I’m going to give Capricorn what it
deserves.”
And so, as Ellis points out, it would be Max’s irrational beliefs and not the
unpleasant activating event which would truly be making him upset and
enraged. And as Ellis has shown throughout this book, these irrational beliefs
are exaggerations of the facts of the situation. All companies, because they are
composed of humans who are fallible, will occasionally act unfairly. It’s in their
nature!
While few might argue that Capricorn acted fairly, there is no evidence that
Max can’t stand unfairness (although there is evidence that it will lead to
additional discomfort on his part if he is to reach the new standard). And as is
the case with any person who acts unfairly or incompetently, it would be an
overgeneralization for Max to conclude that becausehis sales manager acted in a
wrong way, that he is a hopeless, no-goodnik who deserves to be severely
punished for his acts.
REBT helps business people like Max solve the emotional problems they have
about work problems by helping them to recognize and dispute their irrational
thinking.
REBT’s blueprint for success
The essential ingredients of Ellis’ approach to improving job performance
are as follows: First, he helps clarify the value people place on achieving
signiﬁcant levels of job success. In particular, he shows them how to choose
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
190

and commit themselves to a long-term level of professional achievement while
not limiting themselves by excessive anxieties that may arise from fear of failure.
Second, Ellis encourages people to identify their short-term and long-term
professional goals (type of job, level of advancement, professional awards and
signiﬁcant contributions, professional skills and knowledge, ﬁnancial), which
will enable them to realize their chosen level of achievement. Third, Ellis helps
people to focus on their personal obstacles to achieving these goals, including
their hostility towards others, indecisiveness, self-downing, perfectionism, and
procrastination andtoseewhichofthesetheyhadbetterovercome.Fourth,Ellis
provides them with rational attitudes and alternatives in order to combat the
irrationalities, which are responsible for their problems. And, ﬁfth, Ellis helps
them to develop a daily action plan whereby they decide where, when, and how
they are going to engage in those actions, which will help them to achieve their
various goals.
While REBT also recognizes the importance of practical skills in facilitating
goal achievement (communication skills, time management, conﬂict resolu-
tion, etc.) and, frequently, teaches these skills if a person lacks them, it views
personal-emotional reactions as the main stumbling blocks to success.
Enhancing Decisiveness
To be a successful worker requires the ability to think through what is required
to achieve an objective or to solve a problem and then to act upon one’s analysis.
Ellis has described two main types of ineffective decision-making: indecisiveness
and over-impulsive decision-making.
According to Ellis, indecisiveness occurs in situations when you know a
decision had better be made for the good of yourself and your work, but you
vacillate or avoid the issue because you are afraid that you will make a bad
decision and fear other people’s reactions. A dire need for approval is at the core
of indecisiveness. This problem is created when you irrationally convince
yourself that you could not stand to be disapproved of and criticized by others.
And further, that such mistakes and disapproval would prove how hopeless you
really were. This is especially the case for tough decisions, the ones that entail
considerable risk or hardship.
The following exchange between Ellis and a woman who believes the world
is exploiting her shows the irrationalities underlying indecisiveness and how
REBT can be used to overcome them. Irene, aged 39, is one of two physiothera-
pists who have an extensive practice in Westchester, New York. She has the
major responsibility for the administration and business side of the operation as
well as seeing many patients during the week and on Saturday mornings. Irene is
married and mother of two boys. She decided to seek some help for chronic
indecisiveness.
A concern she raises with Ellis during the early part of this session is about
one of her part-time secretaries whom she believes was being dishonest in the
Work
191

reporting of the number of hours she was working. Additionally, she was
concerned about the quality of the work of this secretary. As will be seen, Irene
has had a great deal of difﬁculty being decisive and ﬁrm with her secretary and
her patients.
IRENE:
I’m going to tell her (the secretary) that I feel she is not happy in this
job and that I feel she doesn’t provide the kind of work that I need and
that I feel that it is more in her interests to ﬁnd something that she will
be happy with in the future. So anyway the upshot is that what’s
important to me is that this particular incident is repetitive and that
I’ve had other people take advantage of me and I’m kind of victimized
a lot I think by my employees. I’ve got a hard time exerting authority.
ELLIS:
Because you’re afraid of what? Let’s suppose you were more authori-
tative with them and not so friendly, what would you be afraid of?
IRENE:
IthinkultimatelyIwantthemtocareformeandcareforthewelfareof
my practice and to like me.
ELLIS:
That’s just the point. I think you’ve got two conﬂicting views. One,
you want them to care for the welfare of your practice because that’s
what you pay themfor. But thentwo, it soundslikeyou’re demanding
in yourhead that they likeyouand you puttheirlikingyou above your
making decisions that will add to the welfare of your practice.
IRENE:
Apparently, and that’s not businesslike and with this particular girl it
started on the wrong foot from the beginning. We became quite close,
it was almost as though we were sisters or mother and daughter or
something.
ELLIS:
Right.
IRENE:
She asked my advice about a lot of personal things. I know that
recently I’ve been feeling quite unenthusiastic about the prospect of
her continuing to work for me because it seems oppressive, there
doesn’t seem to me to be any future for me in it because I cannot grow
professionally and I am so bogged down in my own busy work.
Anyway, the upshot is that I see this pattern not only in my ofﬁce but
alsowithmyhusband,withmymother,andreally,whenIthinkabout
it, in my childhood I always seemed to have been dominated by
someone. And with this secretary I literally can see that she manip-
ulatesmeinmanyways.Iaskhertodosomethingandshemakesaface
and then I say “Well, what’s wrong?” I asked my husband about this
and does he think that I make myself a victim all the time. He said
“No,” he just thought that I really don’t think defensively and that he
feels I should run my practice like I drive. You have to drive
defensively and not give people too much rope. That really has
been true with regard to my employees and even with my patients.
Especially, in the beginning when I started practice and because my
marriage was unhappy, I tended to get too emotionally involved with
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
192

patients. And over the years I have toned that down and I’ve
controlled it more and literally I had to start doing it by wearing a
facemask. Somehow wearing a facemask kept me from speaking as
much and for me personally created distance because I would get so
emotionally involvedwithpatientsthatcertainlyIthinkIlostpatients
over that. I remember even being irritated when they would sort of
bring me back to what they came there for. I was so involved in some
sort of personal exchange.
ELLIS:
But again isn’t that neediness, needing their love, needing their
approval?
IRENE:
Well, that’s the thing, I realize that I don’t seem to get reinforcement
from myself. I constantly need to have approval from others, and
when I don’t get it I think that my day is ruined, or I’m no good. And
it’sstupid, you know, because so manygood thingscan happen inone
day and one bad thing can happen and all that I’ll focus on is that one
bad thing which shows I’m not liked or a failure.
ELLIS:
Right.
IRENE:
So that I’m beginning to understand what you teach is that one has
qualities but they don’t deﬁne what one is. I mean you can do a lousy
thing without being necessarily a lousy person.
ELLIS:
Right, you failed that day but that doesn’t make you a failure. Or you
didn’t get the approval of others but that doesn’t make you unlovable;
you’ve been wrongly concluding that.
IRENE:
I know. I think I am getting more comfortable with that idea. A few
times recently when I realized that I’m depressed or discouraged I tell
myself, “Well, this is just this event and this event does not deﬁne
you.” I’m getting more comfortable with that idea because before I
certainly could never separate the two.
ELLIS:
That’sgood.Nowit’simportanttokeepseparatingtheratingofyourself
from the rating of your acts and not liking your failings but accepting
you. And you need not like thefact thatcertain peoplereally don’tlove
you and take advantage of you. You don’t have to view yourself as
unlovable and rotten because of that. You have been leaning over
backward to get even your employees’ approval because you think, “I
need it,” instead of “I like it, but I’d like their doing a good job more.”
IRENE:
I guess that I’m uncomfortable with the idea of really demanding
excellence from my employees, because then they might leave me.
ELLIS:
And demand has two meanings. One, “They absolutely must do
well” – which is nutty because there’s no reason that they must. And,
two, a sensible demand or ultimatum, “If they don’t do well then I’ll
get rid of them because I hired them, I pay them to do reasonably
well, they’re not going to be perfect but I’ve a right as an employer to
get rid of people who don’t do well or to get them to change.” If you
decided to keep this woman then it would be better to train her to be
more honest and do things better. You have a choice. You do pay
Work
193

them for competence and then you’re irrationally saying but I have
no right to ask competence. Why don’t you have a right to ask
competence of them, so long as you don’t utterly demand it?
IRENE:
The thing is, I suppose I can’t understand it, it seems to me that it’s
obvious that if someone types a letter that they proof read it before
sending it out. I don’t see why I should be picking up somebody else’s
errors. And if I have to be repeatedly making that point then there’s
something very wrong and either they’re not paying attention to my
authority or there’s something wrong with them.
ELLIS:
Or they know that you’re not going to back up your authority. They
know that you’ll ﬁnally do the proof reading. So they can get away
with it. Millions of people try to get away with what they can.
IRENE:
But whyintheworlddothey?Whatisthepointofdoingsomethingin
a half-assed way?
ELLIS:
There’s a very simple answer to that, and that is called again low
frustration tolerance. If they did it in a full-assed way they’d have to
devote more time and energy to it and they don’t want to devote that
time and energy, they want to get away with murder. And many of
them do because of bosses like you. So why shouldn’t they try to get
away with murder?
IRENE:
Well that’s the thing. Here I’m 39 and I simply don’t see the world the
way it really is.
ELLIS:
Right.
IRENE:
I instantly look for the ideal.
ELLIS:
You’re a romantic. You’d better acknowledge it. I’m not saying that
everybody acts poorly. If you have ten employees, about two of them
will tum out to be very responsible and on the ball and you don’t even
have to supervise them. But seven or eight won’t. You’d better face
that. And either you’d better be prepared to let employees go until you
ﬁnd some good ones or else some to be better. Sometimes you can get
an employee who’s quite trainable. We ﬁnd here that when our
employees really start gooﬁng it often isn’t worth training them.
The best thing is, often, to get rid of them and replace them – until you
ﬁnd some good ones – who do exist, but they’re rare. I don’t think you
want to accept that reality. You’re saying the world shouldn’t be that
way, to have so many of these goofers. But it is that way. Now what are
you going to do to live more happily in this kind of a world?
IRENE:
Well obviously I have to tighten up the positions.
ELLIS:
Right. Supervise more.
IRENE:
And also be stricter in the beginning.
ELLIS:
Right. In the case ofthat woman, you probably let hergetaway with it.
Sometimes you can be very friendly with people and still supervise
them closely, but that’s difﬁcult. You mainly insisted on the friend-
ship with her and tried very little on the supervision.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
194

IRENE:
Do you think that I somehow avoid responsibility and avoid making
decisions? I don’t understand why I’m victimized as much as I am. I
think it’s because I don’t have a clear picture of who I am andwhat my
limitationsare.Isometimescan’ttellwhereIendandtheotherperson
begins.
ELLIS:
Let me repeat there are two reasons why you’re often, not always, a
victim. One, is you have a dire need for approval, rather than go after
what you want in life. Therefore, as you just said, you just don’t see
whereyouendandtheotherpersonbeginsbecauseyouthinkyouneed
his or her approval. And two, is your romantic notion, your idealistic
notion of theway people should be. And you get shocked when you see
the facts. But you’re not really looking at the facts. You’re looking at
the ideal and you’re letting that ideal obscure the reality.
Ellis helped Irene see the conﬂict she had between needing approval and
wanting her practice to run more efﬁciently. By making her more aware of her
approval seeking, and less concerned about what others might think of her, Ellis
was able to help rid Irene of the major obstacle preventing her from being more
efﬁcient and decisive. Disputing her belief that people should be able to do a job
conscientiously also helped Irene become less upset about their inefﬁciencies.
This also allowed her to get on with the hiring and/or training of someone who
had the work habits she desired.
Over-decisiveness can sometimes be a problem for people if they make
decisions too quickly and rashly. Without weighing up fully the long-term
consequences of making a decision to spend money, hire or ﬁre personnel, or to
commitoneselftoaparticularcourseofaction,yourimpulsivedecision-making
may end up sabotaging your own best interests. According to Ellis, irrational
beliefs are, frequently, at the core of over-decisiveness.
In his book Executive Leadership, Ellis discusses the situation where a very
successful salesman is disregarding the clear-cut instructions of his sales
manager to hand in detailed sales reports at the end of each week. Rather
than giving the salesman achance to correct his way, the sales manager ﬁres him.
Unfortunately for the sales manager, the president of his company who knows
how good the salesman is, takes a dim view of the sales manager’s action and
demands to know why he ﬁred such an exceptional man without giving him a
chance to reform his map. The sales manager provides the unsatisfactory reply
“I really don’t know. Maybe I was a bit hasty” and deep down knows he really
did the wrong thing by ﬁring him so quickly.
Ellis analyses the sales manager’s over-impulsiveness in terms of what he was
thinking and feeling when forced to decide what to do with a non-cooperative
employee.
If he had stuck to rational beliefs he would have thought to himself
“What a pain! Just as everything was going so well in sales, this joker has
to start disobeying my rules and acting as if he owned the ﬁrm. Now I
Work
195

have to decide whether to let him go or not. And he just happens to be my
best man. What bad luck!” These rational thoughts would only have
caused the sales manager to feel sorry, regretful, and annoyed. And if he
stopped his thinking right there, he probably would have given the
salesman several chances to change his ways before ﬁring him. However,
the sales manager pissed himself off because he irrationally thought to
himself, “How can he do this to me? I’ll be seen as a slob, weak, if I let him
get away with this. I’ll be the laughing stock of the whole ﬁrm. I can’t
stand what he’s done! He’s a real slimy skunk!”7
The sales manager arrived at these conclusions because deep down he held
theirrationalbeliefs(1)“MyemployeesmustalwaysdowhatIwantthemtodo”;
(2) “It’s awful when they don’t”; (3) “I can’t stand to be disobeyed and
embarrassed”; and (4) “People who disobey me are totally bad and worthless
and deserve to be punished!” The ensuing anger and low frustration tolerance are
responsible for the ill-considered, hasty decision.
Indeed, the salesman’s delinquent behavior is not the real issue here. Rather,
it’s the sales manager’s total condemnation of his subordinate, not merely his
acts, as well as the manager’s exaggeration of the signiﬁcance of the event itself
that are the problems.
You can see from this example that one of the major causes of over-
decisiveness is the thoughts and feelings you have about a problem and not
the situation itself. To overcome impulsiveness, ﬁrst rid yourself of the anger
and low frustration that you create about the situation. Through questioning
and challenging your irrational thoughts and reformulating them more ratio-
nally, you can remove the main obstacle to effective decision-making.
In the preceding example, the sales manager could ask himself, “Why can’t he
do that to me?” and answer, “He easily can! With no trouble at all! This is hardly
surprising, considering he is a human and is prone to gooﬁng like all humans.
Now I wonder what I can do to train this salesman to be less of a goofer?” Or the
manager could ask himself, “Is there any evidence that I can’t stand this
behavior?” and answer, “While this man is acting unpleasantly and unprofes-
sionallyandwhileIdon’tlikeit,Ihavecopedwithsuchbehaviorinthepast,Ican
so too now!”
This kind of persistent self-examination of those aspects of your irrational
thinking that lead to anger and low frustration tolerance will gradually enable
you to stop your compulsive tendency to make hasty, over-emotional decisions.
Poor Self-Esteem in the Workplace
The deleterious effects of the feelings of low self-esteem and depression are
similar in the work environment as they are in one’s personal life. When you feel
like a failure because of something that has transpired at work, it is very difﬁcult

to inject the energy necessary to overcome or deal with the presenting set of
conditions. And feelings of inferiority and inadequacy are experienced from
time to time by most of us – especially when we are confronted by our mistakes
and failures aswell aswithwhatweperceive asthe emotional reactions ofothers,
and, in particular, rejection. These feelings are endemic to the workplace.
Ellis considers the way you think about and evaluate your work performance
as often being more of a problem than the event itself. He argues forcefully that
because you are human you are bound to, from time to time, make mistakes and
perform in a sub-standard fashion. In addition, given the irrational, unpredict-
able nature of market forces as well as the people we work with, occasionally
events will conspire against you so that even when you are working optimally
you will fail to achieve what we want.
The rational approach to setbacks and misfortunes at work is for you to learn
asmuch asyou canabout thereasonforthe problemsothatyoucantakesteps,if
possible,torectifythesituation.Itisquiteproperandappropriate foryoutorate
yourperformanceandasaconsequence,feeldispleased,disappointed,andsadif
because of your own or another’s doing, something occurs which prevents you
from achieving your work goals.
Indeed,such feelings,thoughnegative,may wellprovide the incentivefor you
to continue to improve and do better the next time.
Ellis contends, however, that humans have a propensity, which is reinforced
in modern western society, to rate their self-worth in terms of their perfor-
mances,“Idowell,thereforeI’mgreat.Ifailatwork,thereforeI’mafailure.”The
irrational equating of self-worth with work performance is at the heart of not
only the fear of failure but also the fear of trying for outstanding performances.
In the latter case, you may avoid striving for the highest levels of achievement
because you view non-achievement or lesser achievement as a sign of your total
worthlessness and are afraid to take the risk. Ellis’ main objective is in helping
you detach your ego from your achievements.
He says that it is quite right to want to achieve and that it does matter if you
don’t.Butitisquiteself-defeatingandillogicaltorateyourself-worthintermsof
your good or bad achievements.
If you want to do something about feeling low and hopeless at work, and
especiallyif anxiety isaffectingyour concentration andeffort, trytoestablishthe
activating event. This may be a drop in the performance of your division in
comparison with other divisions of your company. Or you may not have
achieved a particular objective you set for yourself at work. Or at the very last
minute, a big prospective client of yours, who up until now was set to sign on the
dotted line, drops out.
If you, as a result of these or similar events, feel overly down and despondent
with yourself and if you ﬁnd yourself very uptight about dealing with similar
situations in the future, you are a self-downer. And it is your own irrational
thinking and negative attitudes which are causing your gut to feel bad, not the
unfortunate event itself. Rather than evaluating what has happened to you
rationally, you blow up the event out of all proportion. You catastrophize, “This
Work
197

is the worst thing that could happen!” and because you see it that way, you
experience low frustration tolerance (“I can’t stand this!”) and overgeneralize
(“I’ll never be able to succeed!”). You crown off your irrational thinking with
the harshest self-rating of them all: “Because I failed to achieve, as I must I am
hopeless and inferior!”
When you ﬁnd yourself in the emotional doldrums which results from this
thinking, you can help yourself out with rational thinking, “While this hap-
pening is unfortunate, it’s only 50 or 60 percent bad, it’s certainly not a
catastrophe. I can tolerate this situation even though I don’t like it. While I
may have performed poorly today, it doesn’t mean I can’t do better tomorrow.
There is much more to me than my work and it is impossible for me or others to
judge my worth in terms of what happens at work.”
In the following public demonstration of REBT, Steven a counselor who
works with alcoholics, volunteers to discuss his frequent feelings of inferiority
at work.
ELLIS:
What problem would you like to start with, Steven?
STEVEN:
Well, it has to do with my conﬁdence in counseling. I work for an
alcoholic rehabilitation center. It’s sort of a conﬂict between the
expectationsthatIplaceonmyselfandthoseIfeelothersplaceonme
too. I feel obliged to get success, even though I know in reality that
you can’t be successful all the time.
ELLIS:
Therefore, how do you feel when you’re not successful?
STEVEN:
Like a failure.
ELLIS:
All right. So at “A” you failed at something – and certainly with
your kind of clientele you will fail lots of times. And at “C” you feel
like a failure. Now what are you telling yourself at “B” that makes
you feel down?
STEVEN:
“I’m not competent, I lack skills. Other people are looking at me and
saying, He lacks skills or He’s not competent.”
ELLIS:
Well, but, how can you prove this? I want evidence that just because
you failed and someone says you’re not competent as a counselor
where is the evidence that you are a Failure, with a capital F?
STEVEN:
In the failures that I experience.
ELLIS:
But suppose, for example, you have a client who is psychotic, which
you often do. And suppose you are unable to reach that client – very
often you won’t be able to reach a psychotic client. Now how does
that prove that it was your doing, your failing?
STEVEN:
In such an extreme case, it doesn’t. But I’m talking about less
extreme cases. You know, someone who seems fairly well adjusted
but who wants to do something about his drinking.
I wouldn’t call him psychotic.
ELLIS:
Well some of them are, let’s face it! But let’s suppose it’s a normal
nutty man and he’s drinking a lot and you don’t succeed in getting

himtogiveitup.Doyouseewhatyourmustisonyourself,whenyou
say “I’m a failure?” What’s your must?
STEVEN:
Well, I must get him to stop drinking, must be successful.
ELLIS:
I must what? “I must get him to stop drinking?”
STEVEN:
Right.
ELLIS:
But isn’t your must a little stronger by saying, “I must get any non-
psychotic client to get better and stop drinking?” Well, what’s your
probability?
STEVEN:
Apparently not very good.
ELLIS:
That’s right! And as long as you’re saying “I must get any non-
psychotic client to stop drinking or being otherwise disturbed,”
you’re going to fail at times. Then “I am a failure” is a derivative of
your must. But if you gave up that must you would tell yourself, “I
havefailedthistimebutI’mnotatotalfailure.”Doyouseethatthat’s
so? Your self-downing stems from the must. Now, again, suppose
you had a friend your age and your background and he’s an alcohol
counselor at your center, too, and he fails at times. Must he succeed
each time with each client?
STEVEN:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
He must?
STEVEN:
Well, I would have the same standards for that person as I have for
myself.
ELLIS:
And if he didn’t succeed what would you think of him?
STEVEN:
Less than successful.
ELLIS:
Well he’s less than successful with that client but would you boycott
him? What would you do?
STEVEN:
My respect for him would be less.
ELLIS:
So you would put him down as a person. Is that right?
STEVEN:
I tend to do that, yes.
ELLIS:
All right. Now do you see why that’s wrong?
STEVEN:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Why?
STEVEN:
Well it’s not allowing for human error, for fallibility.
ELLIS:
And also let’s suppose we could prove that your friend was consis-
tently rotten at counseling. Doesn’t he have some other traits and
acts?
STEVEN:
Yeah, but he should change his job, he shouldn’t be counselor.
ELLIS:
Well, it might be wise if they could get better counselors than he –
which is a supposition. But if they really could and if he’s lousy,
consistently, at counseling, it would be okay for him to change his
job. But suppose he decides, “I have tenure and I decide to keep this
job.” Is he a louse for keeping that job and not doing as well as some
other counselor would do? Is he a louse?
STEVEN:
I would have trouble saying he’s not. I would say that part of him is.
I mean, I would still be able to see the other parts.
Work
199

ELLIS:
Youcouldsay,ifyouwantto,“He’sprettylousyatcounseling.”That
would be okay. “Much of the time he’s pretty lousy.” But it still
sounds like you’re putting him down rather than his behavior down.
And consistently, you are putting yourself down. So you’re getting
poetic justice! As long as you put people down, disrespect them,
despise them, for their crummy or inadequate behavior, you will be
in trouble. Isn’t that true?
STEVEN:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
How could you not put people down when they act poorly,
incompetently? How could you not damn them as humans?
STEVEN:
Be more accepting.
ELLIS:
And how could you be more accepting? What could you do to
become more accepting? That’s the right answer, but that’s a little
vague. What can you do to become more accepting?
STEVEN:
See the difﬁculty of their or my situation, see the realities that you
can’t be totally successful all the time.
ELLIS:
Very few can be!
STEVEN:
Be less judgmental of their being, not less judgmental of their actions.
Because you could be equally judgmental of their actions and say
theircounseling isnot good. That’s okay.You’re jumping fromrating
their counseling to rating them, you see. And acceptance doesn’t
mean accepting their actions as good, it often means accepting their
actionsas bad but nonethelessacceptingthem ashumanswhodobad
actions. You see? And you’re downing people as I said, consistently
castigating you and them. And that’s not going to work. But when
you do it to you, when you down yourself because you failed with
someone, how does that help you succeed with the next client?
STEVEN:
It doesn’t.
ELLIS:
Does it help you sabotage yourself with the next client?
STEVEN:
Yes, it puts more pressure on me.
ELLIS:
That’s right and if you say “I’m a rotten counselor” or “I’m a rotten
person” how can a shit be de-shitiﬁed? How is that possible?
STEVEN:
(laughter)
ELLIS:
You see you’re in an impossible bind and you’re going to get a self-
fulﬁlling prophecy. “A shitty counselor or a shitty person like me is
doomed to act shittily with the next and the next and the next client!”
That thought will help you keep doing poorly. Isn’t that so?
STEVEN:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
So you’re not going to be able very well to correct your shitty
counseling or to do better with the next client. Does putting yourself
down like that have an advantage? Self-rating does have an advan-
tage. Do you know what it is? What do you think the advantage of
downingyourselfis?Thereisoneadvantagethatyoumaynotseebut
which is probably implicit in your negative thinking. Do you know
what it is?
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness

STEVEN:
Always the expectation of success, it diminishes the feeling of
failure.
ELLIS:
Well, that’s true to some degree, but then you’re going to still say
“I should have been successful” and you’re going to knock yourself
down. So no, that’s not a great advantage. The advantage is nobility.
The reason we rate ourselves and down ourselves is because some
day, hopefully we’ll be perfect, up ourselves, and thereby get into
heaven on the golden chariot. But there isn’t very much chance of
that,isthere?Ifyouwereperfect,thatself-ratingwouldbegood.“Oh
boy, I’m going to rate myself and always do well and then I’ll feel
greatandnobleandkingofthegoddamnMay!”Thatwouldbeokay!
But, again, what are your chances?
STEVEN:
Nil.
ELLIS:
Isn’t that why people really rate themselves? Don’t they all aspire to
nobility, to perfectness, to heaven? Isn’t that the basic reason for
doing the self-rating?
STEVEN:
Well,yes.It’skindoflikebeingasuperheroandtryingtogettoheaven.
You can see from this session that Steven’s self-downing resulted from not
only the way he viewed his failure to live up to his own standards, but also
because of his need for the approval of his job performance by others. As is the
casewithmanyself-downers,theirirrationalneedsnotonlyforachievementbut
also for people’s approval causes them to upset themselves about their poor
performance because they failed and also because they cannot tolerate being
judgedpoorlybyothers.These“self-downers”are,however,thepoorestofmind
readers. Because of the approval that they crave so much, they are very likely to
over-estimate and misinterpret the extent to which others are putting them
down for their imperfections.
Perfectionism
Ellis disagrees with the popular sentiment that perfectionism is a good thing.
While he encourages the pursuit of excellence, and, in particular, taking risks to
achieve the fullest of people’s potential, he steadfastly maintains that if people
are perfectionistic, they are not only setting themselves up for a life ﬁlled with
unnecessary unhappiness, but also for a level of emotional stress which leads to
self-defeating work patterns and behavior such as poor concentration, poor
organization of ideas, poor public speaking and public performance presenta-
tions – or worse, to giving up completely.
The main disabling consequences of perfectionism are anxiety and depres-
sion, and the main core of perfectionism is irrational thinking. The philosophy
of perfectionists as expressed in their attitudes is quite similar to that of the
self-downers. Perfectionists believe “I must perform perfectly at all important
things I attempt in life.” The problem with this belief is threefold.
Work
201

First, perfectionists set an extremely high and often unreachable standard to
judge their performances (“perfection”).
Second, they apply this expectation to many areas of endeavor without
taking into account the difﬁculty of neither the task nor their innate
potential and acquired skills to perform this task perfectly.
Third, perfectionists take a quite rational preference for high levels of
performance in areas of their work life (and, often, personal life), and
illogically believe, “Because I would prefer to be totally successful, I must be.”
Where the activating event that leads to self-downing is generally something
that has already happened, such as making a mistake or failing at a job, the
anxiety and stress of a perfectionist rises in anticipation of future events, and, in
particular, of what might happen. As no doubt you will appreciate, a certain
amount of concern about the future can be healthy because it acts as a motivator
to get you to put in the extra effort necessary to perform at a high level.
Unfortunately, too much anxiety or panic interferes with planning and con-
certed effort. Ellis shows how perfectionists’ preoccupation with the possibility
of not succeeding and of what people will think of them actually predisposes
them to over-estimate the probability of some stressful or threatening event
happening (example, being asked to do something they haven’t had a chance to
prepare adequately for), underestimating the likelihood they will be able to
perform perfectly, and, to cap it all off, to put themselves down when they fail
to perform.
There are two main work patterns associated with perfectionism: the “giving
up” pattern and the “stress” pattern. “Giving up” is perhaps the more self-
defeating of the two and, also, the harder of the two to detect. Perfectionists who
“give up” do so because they believe that if they can’t perform perfectly, there’s
no point in trying at all. By not trying, perfectionists protect their “egos” by
never risking failure. Indeed, “giving up” perfectionists rationalize their lack of
effort by saying they really would have succeeded had they tried. If you want to
identify “giving up” perfectionists, look for people who are frittering away their
talent by not attempting new challenges, nor specializing in what they do best
and who remark, “I’m not really interested in getting to the top.” “Giving up” is
the best way for perfectionists to protect themselves from bad feelings. “Giving
up” perfectionists believe that they cannot stand pressure and anxiety and that
they must always be comfortable.
The “stress pattern” is characterized by perfectionists who desperately
demand success but who put so much pressure on themselves for ideal
performances that they worry themselves sick as they prepare to act and
then experience extreme anxiety while performing. Before having to hand in
a report, or make a public presentation, “stressed” perfectionists feel extreme
discomfort in anticipation of what they have to do because they are obsessed
with theirrationalthoughts,“What ifIdon’t perform perfectly,whatwillpeople
thinkofme?”Theirmentalpreparationandeffortisnotwhatitcouldbewithout
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
202

those distracting thoughts. Additionally, the “anticipatory” discomfort can be
so great that perfectionists have to resort to alcohol or drugs to take away the
pain of their anxiety. And at these times, when they have to make public
presentations these types of perfectionistsmay be souptight that they complete-
ly ﬂuff the performance.
Ellis’ approach to treating perfectionism involves a number of steps.
1
He encourages the perfectionist to acknowledge he or she is stressed or
anxious and not to deny it.
2
He shows the perfectionist that stress and anxiety are part of the human
condition. All of us experience it because we’re human.
3
Guiding perfectionists along REBT lines, Ellis teaches them to accept
responsibility for making themselves anxious and stressed and stop blaming
their parents or their environment.
4
Perfectionists are shown that although anxiety and stress is bad (because it is
uncomfortable), it is not terrible and it can be tolerated.
5
Ellisteachesperfectionistsself-acceptancebyshowingthemthatjustbecause
their anxiety and stress is bad, it doesn’t follow that they are bad.
6
Ellis disputes with perfectionists their demands for perfect performance and
encourages them to give up unrealistic standards as well as their demanding
that their standards are always achieved.
The following session will illustrate how Ellis attacks perfectionistic thinking.
Bill is a 29-year-old civil engineer who works for a well-known major
engineering ﬁrm in their research department. He has worked for this ﬁrm
for 18 months since receiving his doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. In that time Bill has demonstrated considerable promise by being
a co-investigator of a project that may revolutionize the garbage disposal
problems of one of the major urban cities in the United States. Over this
period, Bill had experienced an extraordinary amount of stress because of his
own job expectations and, as a consequence, in the 18 months since graduation
has put on almost 20 pounds, largely through excessive drinking. He had heard
from one of his friends that Albert Ellis was scientiﬁc in his approach to life,
people, and their problems: and seeing that his approach to his job and its
demands was not succeeding, he thought he would take the chance and consult
with, hopefully, someone to whom he could relate and who might help him
become more scientiﬁc and efﬁcient in his approach.
ELLIS:
Now, let’s discuss some of the main sources of your anxiety to see what
you could do to overcome them.
BILL:
OK, most recently, I was at an engineering seminar in Denver with 150
other people who were chosen on the basis of ability. The level of
conversation was very educated. That is, most of these people are
prominent in the ﬁeld. I am clearly one of the ﬁve percent of young
Work
203

people who are considered promising and are invited and really
expected to perform on a daily basis.
ELLIS:
Perform by doing what?
BILL:
Well, that is, demonstrate how bright you are and how informed you
are and ask penetrating questions and introduce yourself to all the
people that are considered important at the seminar. That made me
anxious because –
ELLIS:
Because I told myself what?
BILL:
Right, I mean, okay, I was afraid I was going to fall on my face.
ELLIS:
“As I must not!”
BILL:
Right.
ELLIS:
If you stick to “There’s a very good chance I’m going to fall on my face
in this very high level group and that would be highly undesirable,
thereforeI’lltrynottofallonmyface,”youwouldbeconcerned,which
is good. You’d be cautious, concerned, and vigilant; and that would
help you fall less on your face and to do better. So, we want you to be
concerned. But you were over-concerned, anxious, because you were
adding not only “It is desirable to impress these people,” which is
correct, we don’t want you to give that up, but “I have to, I’ve got to.”
Right?
BILL:
That’s right.
ELLIS:
Now why did you have to? Not why was it desirable, we’re assuming it
was, but why did you have to impress these people?
BILL:
It’s a self-imposed pressure; this is an opportunity, therefore, I must
take advantage of it.
ELLIS:
That would be nice, but why must you take advantage of it?
BILL:
Oh, I’m just afraid to fail. I’m afraid that if I don’t succeed at this that
I won’t be able to continue my career and ﬁnd a job.
ELLIS:
As I must.
BILL:
Right.ImeanIrealizethat,theseweredictumsthatIwasgivingmyself.
ELLIS:
That’s right.
BILL:
They’re not useful and were in fact confusing the issue because I was
spending time worrying about the impression I was making rather
than listening to the conversation.
ELLIS:
And also rather than trying to make the impression. You see, in trying
to make an impression your worry will interfere, because you’re
monitoring yourself with, “Am I making an impression, am I making
an impression?” Well, that won’t help you make an impression.
BILL:
I know.
ELLIS:
But the point is you’re just bolstering one must with another. You’re
saying “I must make an impression, because I must do well, because
I must have a guarantee that I’ll get good jobs, because I must get along
withpeople,becauseImustmakeanimpression.”Youseeyou’regoing
around and around deﬁning one mustinterms of another,andthereal
answer is, “There is no goddamned reason why I must!” There is never
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
204

a reason why you have to. There are many reasons why it would be
preferable. But it’s only preferable to make a good impression, to get
people to like you, to speak up, to listen well (which is part of making a
good impression), to ask good questions – these are all preferences and
you’re making them into absolutes.
BILL:
That’s right.
ELLIS:
And it’s the absolute that makes you anxious, not the situation. It’s
your absolutistic demand about the situation, “I must do well, I must
do well, I must do well!” And if we could help you to really, though it’s
hard,togiveupyourdemand,yourcommand,yourmust,andgoback
toyourpreference,thenyoustillwouldbeconcerned.Becausewewant
you to value doing well but not deify it, over-value it.
BILL:
Why am I doing these things?
ELLIS:
Why do you over-value?
BILL:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Because you’re human. Humans are partly out of their fucking minds.
Do you know any human who doesn’t sometimes take a strong desire
and make it into a necessity?
BILL:
No.
ELLIS:
Can you think of a single one that wouldn’t tend to do that?
BILL:
No.
ELLIS:
No; that’s their nature. Now some of it may have originally aided
survival – I’m not sure it did – but we could make that case
evolutionarily. But, actually, when you are in the jungle and tell
yourself, “I must kill that lion!” or “I must kill that fucking tiger!”
you become so tense, that you frequently freeze, you see. If you’d say,
“I’d better kill that lion!” then you probably would ﬁght better. If you
say, “Idon’t giveashit whetherIkillthat lion”thenyou’re notgoingto
survive. We don’t want you to think that way. That’s being un-
cautious, you see, unvigilant. Obviously, to survive you need vigilance
andconcernandahighdegreeofconcernwhenyouliveinadangerous
environment which, we assume, all humans lived in originally.
BILL:
Okay, but I can do the other. I mean I can fall into the “I don’t give
a fuck.”
ELLIS:
I know but, you see, that again is a natural human condition – to go
from one extreme to the other.
BILL:
Right.
ELLIS:
But do you see that behind your “I don’t give a fuck” is a similar
demand or must?
BILL:
Yes.
ELLIS:
You see your real philosophy is, “Since I give too much of a fuck and
that’s terrible to look at the bad results, I therefore will pretend that I
don’t give a fuck at all.” Now that’s a non sequitur. It doesn’t follow.
BILL:
Right.
Work
205

ELLIS:
We’re trying to get you to think, “I usually, practically always, give
much of a damn, but not too much.” That’s, incidentally, why it’s so
hard to keep the balance. Humans don’t normally keep that balance.
They go from one extreme to the other. They think in all or nothing
terms.
BILL:
Okay.
ELLIS:
And if you really want to help yourself get un-anxious, then you have a
few things to do. One, is to recognize anxiety when you feel it. Because
many people just immediately do something about it, they don’t even
recognizeit.Theysay“Who?Me?Anxious?”It’snotjustcalledanxiety.
It’s also called shame, humiliation, embarrassment, self-downing,
feelings of inferiority, inadequacy, shithood. It has many names,
but they’re really anxiety. They’re all basically the same. They all
have the same model: “I must do X well or perfectly well or else I’m a
shit, it’s awful, I’m no good!” Or “I must win your approval by doing
X, Y or Z.” These two are not exactly the same. In some cases you
can win people’s approval by doing badly – such as in adolescent
groups, where one thug wins the approval of the other thugs. These
youngsters feel well and win each other’s approval, but they’re really
notdoingwellandbyplaying hookythey alsolosetheapprovaloftheir
parents and teachers.
BILL:
I went through being a bad guy.
ELLIS:
Becauseyouﬁgured, “Ican’tbethatgoodagood guy,soImightaswell
be a bad guy.” And then you found a peer group that would accept you
because you’re bad. You can always ﬁnd an accepting peer group,
whether it’s very goody goody or very baddy baddy. But the main must
starts with, “I must do well and/or be approved by signiﬁcant others.”
And you think, “I must do well about signiﬁcant acts” because you
don’t give a shit about ping-pong or tiddlywinks or something like
that. Youpick important things, especially afewvery importantthings
like succeeding in school or, right now, succeeding in your work. You
tell yourself, “I must do well and win the approval of those people at
that seminar.” And part of your must is rational and sane: “It would be
highlypreferableifIdidwellandwontheirapproval.”Wedon’twantto
change that. That’s a value, and we’re not trying to change all your
values. We’re just trying to change your self-defeating value, “Because
it would be preferable to succeed ergo I have to!” That’s a magical
jump, a non sequitur. That belief makes you anxious. Now the ﬁrst
thing, as I said, is to acknowledge your anxiety, know that you’re
sweating or stewing or that your mouth is dry, or that you feel
butterﬂies in your gut. Know you’re anxious. And usually you will.
BILL:
I’d recognize that, yes.
ELLIS:
So you don’t need much practice at that. Then, two, acceptthe fact that
the anxiety is part of the human condition. Don’t think that you’re the
only one in that lousy camp.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
206

BILL:
That’s what I don’t want to do. I don’t want to accept it.
ELLIS:
Right, but you’d better!
BILL:
I know, but –
ELLIS:
You see, that’s the point: that you’d better accept the fact that anxiety
is part of the human condition and you’re a human and therefore
your anxiety is statistically normal. Now we’re not saying it’s good
and healthy, but it’s part of being human and there are virtually no
humans who don’t have it. If they didn’t have considerable concern,
which tends to overlap with anxiety, they probably wouldn’t survive.
In ancient times they wouldn’t kill that lion or run away from it. So
that’s the second thing to accept. The third step is harder, because
you’d better accept anxiety, as you already do, as a handicap, as a
pain in the ass, as a discomfort, because it is that. It is uncomfortable
and painful, and it does make you act inefﬁciently. Because, again,
you freeze before the lion, or you run crookedly, climb the tree badly
when ﬂeeing it, because you’re so horribly anxious. It helps you a
little, but it probably sabotages you more, because of the tense feeling
in your gut. And your problem is to admit, “Yes, this is a handicap.
This is bad; this is bad behavior, but this behavior doesn’t equal me. I
am all of my behavior, past, present, and future, therefore, I never
equal my behavior. Because I’m a process, a living process, and you
can’t rate an ongoing process.”
BILL:
I’m aware of that.
ELLIS:
You probably can’t even rate a process like evolution. You can rate the
products of evolution, but the process. How can you give a rating to a
process? It keeps going on and on. You can’t really measure it. But we
do! So you can tell yourself, “I’m a process, but my behavior is bad.”
That’s why you can’t rate a human, incidentally, because what is the
standard? What is the main trait by which to do the measuring? But
that’s the next step; to insist on rating all your important behaviors –
ping-pong and tiddlywinks you can forget about unless you want to be
a ping-pong champ. But don’t rate your self, your essence, your being.
Youcan’tevendeﬁnewhatyouressenceis!Butifyoucoulddeﬁneyour
totality, you would say “I exist and I’m alive and I have a totality,” but
youwouldnotratethis.Nowthisistricky,becausethethingyou’renot
rating, yourself, does the behavior. You see you are responsible. And if
you screwed up at the seminar, you did it! People could have screwed
you deliberately and ganged up on you but normally you do what you
do. If you steal, you steal. Nobody puts a gun to your head and makes
you steal. So the problem is to accept responsibility for those acts, like
screwing up at that seminar, to rate your performance. If you didn’t
rate your performance you wouldn’t improve it. But try not to down,
or rate, or elevate your self in any way. That’s very difﬁcult because
that’s, again, our biological tendency.
BILL:
But it’s such a ﬁne line, it’s so easy to cross.
Work
207

ELLIS:
Yes, it is! You see, you can’t win if you’re a real perfectionist. If you
were only a perfectionist in only one area then maybe you’d get by.
But even then you’re going to fall on your face by acting imperfectly.
And you get older and lose some of your abilities. So you see you can’t
be perfect! Instead, ﬁrst, say, “I’m anxious.” Second, “I created my
anxiety for the most part. It wasn’t my goddamn mother’s and
father’s fault! I made myself anxious.” Third, “that’s bad, that’s
deplorable that I created this panic. But I can always accept me,
myself, my being, the maker of this anxiety, with that bad trait. And if
I’m really elegant at using REBT, I’m never going to rate my me-ness,
myself, my being. I’m only going to rate my traits and acts, in order to
achieve my goals.” Now if we help you to do that – which is very
difﬁcult for humans to do no matter how bright they are – you can
gradually, not easily, minimize your anxiety. You can make it go
down and down. And, after a while, you automatically, when you do
poorly, think, “Shit, that was bad but I’m not bad!” And when you’re
about to go to a seminar or do something important, you tell yourself,
“Now I could fuck up” – because you could. There’s little question
about that. “Okay, so I could! But why will I be a shit if I do. It will be a
pain in the ass? It will be, but will the world come to an end? Will I
roast in hell forever?”
BILL:
It’s ironic that I realize that in a sense – that I will tell it to other people.
Ifmyco-workerfucksup,Iwillsay“Don’ttakeitpersonally.”Roughly
the same thing.
ELLIS:
Right, but if you fucked up . . .?
BILL:
I’m not allowed, you know.
ELLIS:
That’s why I say we are all really grandiose. The essence of disturbance,
philosophically, is our grandiosity.
BILL:
That’s right.
ELLIS:
We allow others to do what we would never allow ourselves to do.
BILL:
But it does seem one is always asked to prove oneself.
ELLIS:
You’re very bright but you just made an error. You’re really asked by
others to prove that your deeds are okay. But then you say, you
interpret, “They’re asking me to prove myself.” Well they don’t give a
shit for your immortal soul!
BILL:
(laughter).
ELLIS:
Most of the people who say, “I’m going to make you prove yourself on
this job” really mean “I’m going to see if you perform well.” If you
perform badly they’ll ﬁre you but they won’t roast you in hell. Some of
them may. I’m not saying that such people don’t exist. They really will
despise you, won’t talk to you again, and will think you’re a shit
because you fucked up one goddamn job. That is possible. But usually
it’s you. I contend that if we were pure scientists we wouldn’t be
emotionally disturbed. Unscientiﬁcally our hypotheses are “I must do
well. You must treat me fairly. The world must be easy!” Now those are
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
208

just hypotheses, but people take them as facts – and thereby upset
themselves.
BILL:
They’re givens, they’re the jumping off point. There is no question
of that.
ELLIS:
That’s right. And they fail to stick to the hypotheses, “It would be
preferable if I did well, if others treated me fairly, and if the world was
easy.” Those assumptions are okay, because you can empirically
validate them and discover if your preferences actually would lead
tobetter results.But absolute hypotheses like“Underallconditions, at
all times, I must be better than you, you must treat me fairly, and the
world must be easy!” – how are you going to validate that crap?
BILL:
The thing is it’s so hard to hear the “I must.”
ELLIS:
I know, it’s often implicit. But seek and ye shall ﬁnd!
Bill was helped by Ellis to not only recognize that his dysfunction was largely
self-generated from his perfectionistic thinking, but he was also provided with
evidence through his use of the scientiﬁc method of the unsoundness of his
personal philosophy. Moreover, Ellis’ basic humanistic philosophy of self-
acceptance provided Bill with a self-enhancing alternative to self-rating and
self-blaming.
Procrastination
Perhaps, the biggest obstacle to realizing your potential at work is what appears
to be the irrational human tendency to put off till tomorrow that that preferably
should bedonetoday.Thereislittlequestionthattopachieversinallprofessions
have the ability to put in sustained effort, especially on the hard or unpleasant
tasks that have to be done in order for them to reach their goals. REBT, perhaps,
more so than any other approach provides insights as to why you procrastinate
and, more importantly, how you can overcome the problem. Indeed, Ellis’ book
Overcoming Procrastination (co-author, William J. Knaus) has helped over
250,000 people do something about improving their efﬁciency at work or in
other areas of their life.
Why do people procrastinate? According to Ellis, the cause of procrastination
is their reaction to hard, unpleasant or boring events, rather than the events
themselves. Achievers in life react differently than non-achievers to paper work,
deadlines, repetitious work, long hours, “demeaning” activities, and the general
drudgery of work. The difference can be found in the rational ways achievers
evaluate having to perform these various activities.
In tackling procrastination, Ellis focuses on three different emotional reac-
tions. First, he looks for people’s tendency to put themselves down for their
procrastination. Chronic procrastinators often view themselves as total failures
because of their excuse making and gooﬁng. As Ellis counsels, however, what
are the chances a total failure can do anything successful to overcome any
Work
209

problems? So the ﬁrst step in modifying procrastination is for people to accept
themselves while hating and working hard to change their self-indulgent,
inefﬁcient behavior. Once people stop putting themselves down, they can
then work on the main cause of procrastination: low frustration tolerance
and the associated irrational attitudes, which underlie this condition.
Now most people, when thinking about having to do paper work, making
follow-up phone calls or writing reports, experience some degree of discom-
fort, tension, and frustration. What differentiates procrastinators from self-
disciplined workers is their relative inability to tolerate the discomfort they
experience in anticipation of performing the tasks and the enormous feelings
of frustration they experience about having to do the work. And their different
reactions to unpleasant boring, and hard work are reﬂected in their attitudes
and thinking. The self-disciplined worker rationally thinks: “While it’s hard to
do this work, it’s not too hard, and it’s harder if I don’t. While it may be unfair
to do these boring tasks and give up my free time, that’s the way it is. Life
wasn’t meant to be fair or easy. I know if I want to achieve tomorrow, I’d better
put in today.” This mental approach enables people to tolerate discomfort and
reduce frustration by not blowing the unpleasantness of the tasks out of
proportion and not demanding that they shouldn’t have to do them. The
procrastinator, unfortunately, brings to work a different set of attitudes and
assumptions.
SomeofthefaultyassumptionsandirrationalbeliefswhichEllishasidentiﬁed
as working against the procrastinator’s desire to work more efﬁciently and
which lead to the constant rationalization as to why the work hasn’t been done
are: “It’s easier to avoid facing many of life’s difﬁculties and self-responsibilities,
than to take on more rewarding forms of self-discipline,” “I don’t believe I can
discipline myself” (“It’s too hard”), “I shouldn’t have to do unpleasant things in
ordertogetpleasantresults,”“Ineedtobecomfortableallthetime,”and“Imust
have what I want (short-term pleasures) when I want it, and not what I don’t
want (discomfort).”
When faced with having to do unpleasant activities procrastinators,
through irrational self-talk, literally make the activities and their feelings
about them so horrible, that it is impossible for them to self-motivate: “This
work is not only hard and boring, but it is too hard. I can’t stand it! Life should
be easier, fun, and more exciting. This is really unfair. It’s awful, horrible, and
terrible!”
Low frustration tolerance is one of the most difﬁcult tendencies for you to
overcome. Ellis recognizes that in many instances it is not sufﬁcient simply
todispute theirrationalityofyourbeliefs.Indeed,itisnot uncommonforyouto
understand your irrationalities intellectually, but to be unable to feel or act any
differently.
So Ellis advises the use of thinking, feeling, and behavioral methods to
encourage change. He employs logical and scientiﬁc methods to try to modify
your attitudes as well as encouraging you to write down a list of all the
disadvantages of procrastinating and the advantages of getting it done.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
210

Emotionally he gets you to shout rational self-statements forcefully and
vigorously and also to use rational-emotive imagery (see Chapter 2) in order
to change how you feel about your work. Behaviorally, he gives homework
assignments which involve you specifying some minimal work behavior you
agree to perform and gets you to reward or punish yourself depending on the
degree you follow to your own prescriptions.
A ﬁnal problem that sometimes resides at the core of the procrastinators’
belief system is perfectionism. That is, even after you stop putting yourself down
because of your procrastination and signiﬁcantly changes your attitude towards
hard and unpleasant work and become more tolerant of frustration, you still
may not perform the work because of your demands for perfect performance at
these times, and your fear of receiving criticism and disapproval from others.
Is it any wonder, then, that procrastination is such an intractable condition?
A ﬁnal step to overcoming procrastination to be taken in cases of perfectionism
is to dispute with you the irrational demands for perfect performance and your
need for approval.
What follows is almost the complete transcript of a public demonstration
conducted by Ellis with a woman who volunteers for help for her procrastina-
tion.Theonlybackgroundinformationavailableisthatthewoman,Marsha,has
beentryingtomotivateherselftocompleteherdoctoraldissertationandhashad
little success:
ELLIS:
Okay, what problem do you want to start with?
MARSHA:
Well, it’s my dissertation. I can’t seem to motivate myself to get it
done.
ELLIS:
That’s a common problem, yes. And what’s the problem? Why
don’t these bastards give you your dissertation?
MARSHA:
(laughter) Well, because I’m just not doing it.
ELLIS:
You’renotdoingit.Howmanycenturieshaveyoubeenworkingon
your dissertation?
MARSHA:
(laughter) It just seems like many. Actually I started about four
years ago.
ELLIS:
Four years ago you started, and how far along are you on that lovely
dissertation?
MARSHA:
No place.
ELLIS:
So you’re noplaceonthedissertation –you meanyoudidn’t doany
of it, or what?
MARSHA:
Ohno,no,no.Idolotsofthings,Idocomputerruns,Iregisterevery
semester for exorbitant amounts of money – you know all those
things – but I don’t write the dissertation.
ELLIS:
Do you have a topic?
MARSHA:
Oh yes.
ELLIS:
Have you done anything on it, on the topic? Have you read
literature?
Work
211

MARSHA:
Oh yes.
ELLIS:
Oh you read the literature. And it’s a study?
MARSHA:
Experimental, yes.
ELLIS:
Did you do the study?
MARSHA:
No.
ELLIS:
Okay, so the one thing you better do before you write it up is
the study. Of course, you could write the study ﬁrst, but it would
be impractical to do it ﬁrst. And you know what to do because you
have the outline and it’s accepted. Now when you think of doing
something on the study, on the experiment, what do you tell
yourself to block yourself from doing it? I can guess right away,
but let’s see if you can ﬁgure it out. I think I already know.
MARSHA:
Icanthinkofjustanumberofthingsthatatthatmomentintimeare
so much more critically relevant than writing.
ELLIS:
Such as eating ice cream, looking at TV?
MARSHA:
No, no, even things that I can really justify.
ELLIS:
Yes, right. Supermarket shopping?
MARSHA:
No, no, no, my practice.
ELLIS:
But those we call rationalizations. “Instead of doing my study I’ll do
something else useful.”
MARSHA:
It would have to be useful.
ELLIS:
Okay, “Because if I stop the crap and did the study – ?” You’re
ignoring what you’re telling yourself about doing it. “If I just
ignored those extra things, did a few of them to stay alive, but
did the study right now for at least an hour or two a day what – ?”
What are you telling yourself about doing it? Forget about the
excuses for the moment. “If I did it right now, today, tomorrow – ?”
What?
MARSHA:
If I started doing something really constructive in terms of the
experiment?
ELLIS:
Yes.
MARSHA:
What would happen, the immediate result?
ELLIS:
You’re saying something blocks you from doing it, forces you to
make up excuses about the other very relevant things which aren’t
so goddamn relevant. “If I did that study today, if I worked on it,
what would be the minimum number of hours it would be wise to
work on it – minimum, per day?”
MARSHA:
It would be very minimal. I think it’s just a matter of, you know, if
I could just start off with an hour, 30 minutes.
ELLIS:
All right, let’s take an hour. “If I put my ass to the chair and did an
hour today, what?”
MARSHA:
I think that would break the block – whatever it is.
ELLIS:
I know. But what are you telling yourself not to do? You’re right,
that might lead you to work for ﬁve hours. In my book with Bill
Knaus on overcoming procrastination we have a technique where
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
212

you force yourself to do something even for 15 minutes minimum
and what do you know, you start doing it for 30, 60, etc. “But if I sat
my ass down and did this right now” you’re saying something about
it that’s blocking you, and I know what it is.What do you think itis?
MARSHA:
Tell me because I’m not really certain.
ELLIS:
Well you’re not saying it would be a rare delight.
MARSHA:
Well, to do it would be a rare delight.
ELLIS:
No, no, to have it done would be a rare delight.
MARSHA:
To have it done, yes. (laughter) I thought about that too.
ELLIS:
“If I sat down to do it, it would be,” what? It wouldn’t be a rare
delight.Whatareyoutellingyourselfitwouldbe?“IfIjustsatdown,
no shit, and did it,” it would be what?
MARSHA:
Okay, to just sit down and do it, and that would be the problem.
Getting myself to sit down is the problem. Once I’m sitting there
doing it that’s no problem.
ELLIS:
Well,allright,you’reokayonceyoustart“ButifIforcedmyselftosit
down and start it,” what? You’re saying something negative about
that. What is your belief about forcing yourself to sit down and
start?
MARSHA:
Maybe that’s the problem, because I’m not really certain, I really
don’t know.
ELLIS:
It’s something unpleasant. You do know, you see. You’re copping
out.
MARSHA:
Maybe I am because I’m seeing that starting it – to be starting is
ﬁnishing and that is very positive. It’s the not starting it that I’m
focusing on and why I’m not starting.
ELLIS:
Oh,Iseewhatyou’redoing.Yes,you’reright.Andthatwasmyerror
because I went back to the primary symptom instead of the
secondary one. Your primary symptom is called “C” procrastina-
tion,at“A”youdecidetodosomething,thenat“B”youtellyourself
something that makes you not do it. We’ll get back to that later. But
then you take “C” and you make it into a new “A”: “I am
procrastinating.” Now how do you feel about procrastinating?
How do you feel about it?
MARSHA:
I don’t feel very good about it because I’ve committed myself.
I’ve made promises to myself and others, but primarily to myself to
ﬁnish it.
ELLIS:
Yes. What do you mean by “not very good?” Let’s be a little more
concrete. Howdo you reallyfeel if forthe next50yearsyou don’tdo
this, you procrastinate for 50 years. What’s your feeling about the
procrastination?
MARSHA:
I guess I’d feel very disappointed, very disappointed in breaking a
promise I made to myself.
ELLIS:
So you would feel disappointed, that’s right. But is that your only
feeling? Let’s be honest.
Work
213

MARSHA:
No.
ELLIS:
What’s the other one that’s more important?
MARSHA:
That I’d failed a goal that I’d set for myself.
ELLIS:
And because I failed to do it, continued to procrastinate, that makes
me what?
MARSHA:
It makes me not quite – let’s see, it makes me feel very much like a
failure.
ELLIS:
Right, “and that makes me a failure.” Now as long as you say “I’m a
failure for procrastinating, I’m a failure for procrastinating, I’m a
failure for procrastinating,” you’ll be so hung up on your fail-
ureship that that will help you procrastinate, you see. That’s your
secondary symptom or symptom about your symptom. So if you
stop saying, “I’m a failure for procrastinating,” we then get back to
the procrastination itself, for solving the secondary symptom. The
primary one doesn’t solve it. But why are you not a failure for
procrastinating? Because you’re not. Now why are you not?
MARSHA:
Idon’tknowwhyI’mnotafailure forprocrastinating. Icanthinkof
reasons why I’m not a failure generally.
ELLIS:
Right. But even let’s suppose you procrastinate forever. Why are
you still not a failure for that, for procrastination? You sort of
implicitly just answered it, but not clearly enough.
MARSHA:
Because I succeed at other things.
ELLIS:
That’s right, so you’re never a failure. You’re failing at this
dissertation, but how does that make you a failure – with a capital
F? How does it?
MARSHA:
It doesn’t, and maybe that’s what’s keeping me from doing it.
Because I can sort of justify sometimes being successful here, even
though I’m failing there.
ELLIS:
Well that’s a rationalization, again. You’re saying, “because I’m
not a total, total, total failure therefore I’m allowed to
procrastinate.” We’ll get back to that. But you are also telling
yourself “At times, not all the time, I am a failure for procrasti-
nating. Look what a failure I am! I should be doing the thesis!” And
that’s going to help you procrastinate more. You had better face the
fact that you are a human who is procrastinating – who is failing
doing your thesis period. And that’s too goddamn bad! Unless you
accept this, you won’t get back to the original procrastination –
your secondary symptom is interfering with your primary one,
you see? You’re guilty about procrastinating and your guilt is
stopping you from working on the procrastinating because your
feelings of guilt are absorbing you. And you can obsess yourself
with the guilt – otherwise known as self-downing or self-depreca-
tion. It has lots of names. Usually we call it guilt or shame when it’s
about procrastination and if you would get yourself to say “Yes,
that is bad, my procrastination, because it won’t get me where
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
214

I want. But I am never under any condition a bad person. It is too
damn bad that I’m procrastinating but, I am not a failure,” then we
could get you to tackle the procrastination. Do you see that you’re
not going to get back to working at reducing your procrastination
while you’re absorbed in putting yourself down for engaging in it?
Do you see that that’s going on?
MARSHA:
I now can see it.
ELLIS:
So your ﬁrst step is to ﬁrst accept you with your crummy procrasti-
nation. We’re not exonerating your procrastination. We’re not
rationalizing and saying “Oh, but I’m doing these other good
things.” Horseshit! You’re screwing yourself. But you can still
accept you while screwing yourself. You see that you can do
that? That’s what you’d better work on. Now once you start
working on that –. Now we’ll just assume for the moment that
you take a while to work on it and give up your guilts. Let’s suppose
you’re no longer guilty. At “A” you decide to work an hour, we’ll
just say an hour to make it easy, on your thesis. And at “C” you put
off doing it because you are now saying what about the work? Not
about you, but about the work, that’s stopping you from just
unpleasantly doing it – and it will be unpleasant at the beginning.
Now what are you saying about that hassle that stops you from
unpleasantly putting your ass to the chair and working on the
thesis?
MARSHA:
That it’s boring and hard.
ELLIS:
Right. Getting started. It’s boring. It’s hard. But if you only stopped
at “It’s hard and boring,” you’d do it. Do you know why you’d do it
if you only said that to yourself? Because it’s more boring and harder
if you don’t do it. You see? So you’re saying more than it’s boring
and hard. There’s another idea you’re sneaking in there. Now what
do you think that is? “Because it’s boring and hard,” what? “I
shouldn’t have to do it!”
MARSHA:
Yes, that’s it.
ELLIS:
So you see, you’re saying “It shouldn’t be that boring, that hard. It’s
too hard! How awful that it’s that hard! Damn it, I won’t do it!” You
see? That is LFT, low frustration tolerance; and almost every person
who procrastinates about a thing like a thesis, has it. They have
generally one other thing that goes with it and that is as follows. “If I
did that thesis – no matter how hard it is” – and let’s suppose you
did it, what does it have to be? When you do it, what are you
demanding that it has to be?
MARSHA:
Perfect.
ELLIS:
Ahah! “I must do it perfectly like all other theses are perfectly done!”
Right? As long as you have that in your head –
MARSHA:
I know, it will never get done.
Work
215

ELLIS:
Right. So you see, you have two ideas and they’re both leading you
to procrastinate. One, “It’s too hard. It shouldn’t be that hard! How
awful!” Then, two, “I must do it perfectly well – a great, noble,
marvelous thesis. And if I don’t do a great, noble, dissertation, then
back to shithood go I”
MARSHA:
I don’t think it’s really that hard. It’s the boring part and it’s the
perfect part, because it’s easy really.
ELLIS:
That’s right, it is boring. But you’d better face the fact that it’s more
boring if you don’t do it. Do you know why it’s more boring if you
don’t do it? Because you’ll fart around with this boredom forever.
Isn’t it a bore saying, “I’ll do it, no I won’t. I’ll do it, no I won’t?”
MARSHA:
I know, my friends are already bored.
ELLIS:
That’s right and you’ll get bored with it. Whileif you did it, it would
be over, you see. In all these things whether it’s procrastinating on a
thesis, on a term paper, on being late for an appointment, or
whatever, it’s harder if you do procrastinate and you’re saying “It’s
harder if I do it, the thesis.” And that’s false.
MARSHA:
You’re right. It’s harder procrastinating, it’s much harder than
doing it and getting it over with.
ELLIS:
That’sright,butyou’dbetterreallygetconvinced.You’resayingthe
truth right now. But as soon as you start to do the thesis, you may
easily go back to saying, “Oh shit, look how boring it is!” And you’d
better write down a list of the pains of procrastination. Take a few
days to write down all the disadvantages of procrastinating and all
the advantages of getting the thesis out of the way. Then go over
those.
MARSHA:
No comparison. It’s more disadvantageous to procrastinate.
ELLIS:
Ah right. But you’d better sink those disadvantages in, because at
the time you’re about to work on the thesis you only focus on the
advantages ofnot doingitandthedisadvantagesofdoingit.Yousee
that’s your focus.
In this demonstration Ellis shows Marsha the three separate problems that
are demotivating her (self-downing, low frustration tolerance, and perfection-
ism) and, helps her achieve, probably for the ﬁrst time, real insight into her
problem.
These are some, but certainly not all, of the applications of REBT to business
problems. Other topics that Ellis deals with include improving on-the-job
discipline and communication skills, which involves showing people how to
defocus on the negative events and to be less vulnerable to disapproval and
criticism from others. Ellis tackles overcoming hostility towards co-workers
through teaching people to accept others in spite of their unfair and inefﬁcient
behavior. Whatever problems exist at work, Ellis shows how rational thinking
and emotional self-management skills can be employed to overcome them.

Children and Parents
I disagree with the hypothesis that children can best be helped to become
relatively un-neurotic adults by emphasizing their very early emotional
training and education, and particularly by stressing the proper breast
weaning, toilet training, and eating habits. There is no real evidence that
faulty bowel training traumatizes a child for the rest of his life, and there is
much evidence that this is not true. There is much more evidence that
good thinking and healthy living habits can more logically be taught to
most children when they are ﬁve years of age or older than when they are
considerably younger. For they then can be persuaded rather than merely
conditioned to think and act more rationally and can become problem-
solving rather than merely auto-suggestive individuals.7
Oneoftheareasofliving,whichcontains thegreatest potentialfor destructive
emotional tensions and reactions, is family life. It is very sad to witness the
fragmentation of families because of long-standing conﬂicts between parents
and children that remains unresolved. Because Ellis teaches people emotional
survival skills, it has over the years, been an extremely important resource for
familiesincrisis.REBThasasoneofitsbasicassumptionsthatwhenparentsand
children become (and stay) disturbed about the behavior of each other, it is
almost impossible for them to communicate and solve their problems

Since Ellis wrote How to Raise an Emotionally Healthy, Happy Child in 1966
(co-author with Sandra Moseley and Janet Wolfe), many parents have proﬁted
from Ellis’ unique ways of viewing the problems of parents and children as well

as REBT’s unique methods. More recently in 2006, Ellis and I have edited a
book for professionals: Rational Emotive Behavioral Approaches to Childhood
Disorders.
Ellis offers solutions to parents who are disturbed about problems of one or
more of their family members. He offers a variety of practical suggestions that
parents can use to help their children overcome emotional and behavioral
problems. In addition, Ellis helps “grown-ups” to get along better with their
parents.
Parenting Styles and Discipline
Parenting styles represent the guiding philosophy and major child-rearing
practices that parents rely on to bring up their children. Said another way,
parenting style is the way parents believe their child should preferably be
brought up. Parental child rearing ideas generally stem from how they were
brought up as well as other sources of information to which they may have been
exposed.
Ellis takes the position that a parents’ style of parenting – the principles and
procedurestheyuse andbelievein –canhelpthe parentbringuphealthy,happy,
conﬁdent, self-disciplined, and achieving children. Over the years, Ellis and his
REBT colleagues (as examples, Paul Hauck, Virginia Waters, Jay and Harriet
Barrish, Ray DiGiuseppe, Marie Joyce) have been able to identify different styles
of parenting that either lead to or prevent parents from achieving these goals for
their children.
Unkind and ﬁrm patterns of parenting involve such parental behavior as the
setting of rigid rules, never letting their child question parents’ authority,
focusing on the wrongdoing of their child, attacking the personality of their
child, using overstrictness, disciplining with anger, little praise, and no open
affection.Asaconsequenceofunkindandﬁrmparentalbehavior,childrenoften
regard themselves as worthless and inferior, and view everyone else as superior.
They experience feelings of anxiety, insecurity, and guilt, and may demonstrate
not only submissive behavior, but also, may avoid things they ﬁnd difﬁcult or
unpleasant. Parents who subscribe to an unkind and ﬁrm child-rearing philos-
ophy tend to hold a number of irrational beliefs and ideas about parenting and
children. As you’ll see, they are irrational because they are unrealistic, inaccu-
rate, and lead parents to become overly upset with their children.
According to Ellis, an irrational and overemotional parent is “dangerous”
for a child’s sense of self-worth and is generally an ineffective disciplinarian.
A parent who is impatient with his child is a poor model for the child to learn
from. The major irrational belief which underlies an overly strict and harsh style
of parenting is that “children must not question or disagree with their parents.”
While it is certainly desirable for children to obey their parents, it is only that,
desirable. Most if not all children, because of their nature, will go through
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
218

periods of disobedience; and, therefore, to demand 100 percent compliance will
almost guarantee that parents will overly upset themselves when the inevitable
occurs. Parents who hold this belief discipline with anger and, frequently,
condemn and put down their children for their misbehavior.
Children then easily upset themselves about their parents’ angry outbursts
and may either continue to misbehave in the future or feel unlovable and
worthless. Other irrationalities of strict and harsh parents are:
1
Getting angry is an effective way to modify my child’s behavior.
2
Anger helps get things done.
3
Since a child should do well, praise and reward are unnecessary and spoil the
child.
4
Doing bad must always be punished since punishment, blames, and guilt are
effective methods of discipline.
5
As a parent I should have the power to make my children do whatever I
want.
6
Children are naturally undisciplined and behave like beasts. Parents must
beat them into shape to make them civilized.
The kind and unﬁrm parenting style (sometimes called “permissive” parent-
ing) involves parents who, while showing love and affection to their children,
make few rules and set few limits. Parents who are not ﬁrm enough with their
children hold a number of erroneous ideas about what’s good for children,
including:
1
Children must not be frustrated.
2
All punishment is wrong.
3
Children absolutely should be free to express themselves.
Ellis contends that frustration is a natural life occurrence and rather than
avoiding frustration, people (including children) had better learn to live with
and overcome frustration. If parents overprotect their children from unpleas-
antness, failure, and frustration, these children will not be prepared to cope with
the frustrating aspects of daily living. Children of those parents may become
“goofers” who are emotionally oversensitive, have low frustration tolerance,
shirk responsibility, and underachieve in school and in later life.
People who are chronic rule breakers and who may be in trouble with the law
often have parents who are both unkind and unﬁrm. Such parents harshly
criticize their children for misbehavior and hardly ever praise them when they
are “good.” They believe their children are deliberately trying to misbehave and
they denounce, scold, and blame them for their misbehavior. Even though they
do not set limits and rules for their children to follow, they expect them to have
the wisdom to betheir own conscience.Thesechildren become angry and overly
frustrated for they are never able to please their parents. They act badly and test
the limits to try to get their parents to show they care.

Ellis has found that the “best” parenting style – the one which produces the
best results – is one characterized by kindness and ﬁrmness. Parents who raise
theirchildreninthisfashiontalkandreasonwiththeirchildaboutobjectionable
behavior, focus on the behavior and do not blame the child, set limits with clear
consequences for rule violations, employ penalties that are designed to teach a
rule rather than condemn the child, occasionally frustrate their child when
necessary, apply pressure to their child to teach self-discipline, rarely punish out
of anger, and frequently praise and show love to their child. Ellis has a great deal
to say about how to discipline a child effectively.
First, it is vital to have rules and desires for appropriate behavior that are
clearly communicated to the child. The child had better know the rewards (and
penalties) for following or breaking rules.
Second, the rules and their consequences are to be applied consistently so that
children have a way of predicting the behavior of their parents and of knowing
what the consequences of their behavior will be.
Third, parents had better calm themselves down ﬁrst when disciplining their
child before expecting their child to calm down. Some parents mistakenly
believe that their disturbances and low frustration tolerance are caused by their
child’s misbehavior and that, therefore, their child should calm down ﬁrst so
that the parent can feel better. These parents do not realize that when they make
themselves extremely upset, their effectiveness in alleviating the problems of
their child is greatly reduced. And fourth, when disciplining a child, parents
preferably should not expect their child’s love or approval at that time. Later on,
parents can remind their child they love him or her even though they disliked
their behavior.
The “kind and ﬁrm” pattern of parenting is an ideal which no parent can
achieveallthetime.Ellisteachesparentstoacceptthemselvesevenwhentheyare
unkind or not ﬁrm enough. Ellis is keen to have parents adopt a self-accepting
attitude so that not only can they remain calm in the face of their own mistakes,
but also communicate this attitude to their children.
Overcoming the Emotional Stresses of Parenting
Emotional stress and other emotional problems, which arise in connection with
being a parent, is undesirable for a number of reasons.
First, too much stress in bringing up children prevents parents from not only
fully enjoying their children, but also works against the parents’ long-term
personal goals of living a happy life with minimum pain and maximum
enjoyment.
Second, some children who are overly sensitive to what their parents do and
say and who are exposed to an emotionally overwrought parent are likely to
experience similar problems themselves. An example would be of a “fearful”
parent whose behavior in the presence of their children actually teaches them to
be fearful by communicating a set of beliefs their children are likely to learn (for
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
220

example, “The world is a dangerous place to live”; “If something is dangerous or
painful,itmustbeavoidedatalltimes”).The“angry”parentwhorantsandraves
about the world’sunfairnessand howhardlifeismayteach anumberofharmful
attitudes to a child such as “I must always have what I want, it is awful when I
don’t. Those people who frustrate me are bad and deserve to be punished!”
A third problem can occur when parents react to their child’s problem in an
overly distressed way. As will be shown shortly, parents’ emotions may interfere
with the effective use of child rearing techniques. Their over-reaction may be
reinforcing or creating serious problems, such as parents continuously blaming
their child for misbehavior. Additionally, children may think they have more of
a problem than they actually have when they witness their parents’ over-
upsetness.
The focus of REBT for parents who are overly stressed and upset about their
children is on teaching them “emotional responsibility”; that is, how to control
their emotions through rational thinking. There are a number of rational
insights that parents learn along the way to reducing stress. First, the under-
standing that parents’ stress, frustration, and other emotional over-reactions
(extreme anxiety, depression, and guilt) come from parents’ thoughts about
themselves and their children (and spouse), and therefore, cannot be blamed on
other people or the situation. Second, extreme stress and upset generally makes
matters worse. Third, it is possible to feel less stressed and upset (though not
wildly happy) about problems at home. Fourth, the means for modifying
emotions comes from an examination and change of parents’ irrational and
erroneous ideas about themselves and their family.
One of the main irrational parent beliefs which create undue stress and upset
can be described by the following statements “My child can upset me”; “I have
little ability to control my feelings at home when something upsets me”; “One
has to get upset when things go wrong”; “My children cause all my un-
happiness”; and “I have little ability to control the unhappiness I am experi-
encing.” Hopefully, you’ll see that these statements are misconceptions about
how much inﬂuence parents really do have to take control of their stress and
emotions. Presented below is a list of rational ideas which can help parents
overcometheirfeelingsofanger,depression,andguiltthatIhavesummarizedin
mybookTheREBTTherapist’sPocketCompanionforWorking withChildrenand
Adolescents (New York: Albert Ellis Institute).
Overcoming anger
1
My anger can be compared to my child’s temper tantrum.
2
When I get angry, it brings me down to the level of a four year old.
3
Anger does not help in the long-run, it is only temporarily effective at best.
4
No law of the universe says that what I wish to happen, must happen;
children are children – ignorant, mischievous.
5
Anger at my child can prevent me from achieving what I want.
Children and Parents
221

Overcoming depression
1
Never blame (damn) myself or others for anything.
2
I am probably better off than I think. Remember my blessings, never pity
myself.
3
My child’s hardships are usually not as bad as I make them out to be. Don’t
blow them out of proportion.
4
My performance as a parent does not determine my self-worth as a person.
5
The performance of my child does not determine the value of myself as a
parent.
Overcoming guilt
1
I am not the sole cause of my child’s problems.
2
I am not so strong to be able to prevent all bad things happening to my child.
3
My child can tolerate frustration.
4
My child’s misfortune is probably not as great as I think.
5
Even when I behave badly with my child, I am not a bad person.
Ellis illustrates in the following transcript of a therapy session how REBT can
be used to help reduce stress in a father who is angry at his teenage daughter’s
behavior.
ELLIS:
Okay Harry, what problem would you like to start with?
HARRY:
I think mine is probably anger.
ELLIS:
Right, at whom or what?
HARRY:
Probably my family, my teenage daughter.
ELLIS:
How old is she?
HARRY:
Thirteen.
ELLIS:
And what does she do when you’re angry at her?
HARRY:
Oh, she has a lot of undercurrent back talk.
ELLIS:
Yeah, so she gives you back talk at point “A” in RET; and then you’re
angry with “C.” Now what are you telling yourself to make yourself
angry at point “B”?
HARRY:
That she shouldn’t be back talking.
ELLIS:
Right. Now why should she not?
HARRY:
She should have more respect for me.
ELLIS:
Why should she?
HARRY:
Because I’m her parent.
ELLIS:
O-o-h, and I run the fucking universe! Right! (laughter)
HARRY:
(laughter) No, just my house.
ELLIS:
Well, but you’re saying, “She should not oppose my running the
house. She should obey me in the house!” Well why must she? Where
is it written that she has to do the right thing and obey you?
HARRY:
It’s not written any place.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
222

ELLIS:
Oh yes it is, it’s nuttily written in your head!
HARRY:
(laughter) I think she should.
ELLIS:
But I want evidence why she should.
HARRY:
Because I’m trying to teach her the right ways of the world.
ELLIS:
That’s why it would be preferable, maybe. Not according to her but
according to you, it would be preferable. Let’s even assume that
everybody in the world would say it’s preferable. Why must your
nutty daughter act preferably?
HARRY:
Because that’s the way I’d like her to act.
ELLIS:
O-o-h. Again, we’re right back to your running the universe!
HARRY:
How come that you’re not able to put a law through congress, “You
must act preferably dear!” And how come she doesn’t obey that law?
HARRY:
Idon’tlikeitwhenshedoesn’tobeyit.It’sjustthewayI’dliketoteach
her how to act so when she goes out she will have an idea of how to do
well.
ELLIS:
Right, but will your anger help teach her? Be honest, will it help her
get worse and rebel more?
HARRY:
Yes, it will.
ELLIS:
Now, therefore, what feeling could you replace it with that would be
better than anger? There is a feeling that you could cultivate instead.
HARRY:
I could let her know I’m disappointed in the way she is acting.
ELLIS:
That’s right. You could be sorry, disappointed – even tell her, “You
know I’m frustrated, dear, with your behavior.” What would you tell
yourself to make yourself feel sorry, disappointed, frustrated?
HARRY:
Well, ﬁrst of all, I have to ﬁnd out that I’m being hooked by her back
talking –
ELLIS:
You’re hooking yourself, making yourself angry.
HARRY:
At ﬁrst, I didn’t know that I’m being hooked.
ELLIS:
Yeah. Know that she’s doing it in order to get you going.
HARRY:
Right.
ELLIS:
Because she knows a sucker when she sees one!
HARRY:
(laughter)
ELLIS:
Right. So she’s using your suckerdom!
HARRY:
(laughter)
ELLIS:
To hook you, OK? So you see that, right? Then what would you do to
stop being a sucker?
HARRY:
I’m not sure what to do.
ELLIS:
Well you could say to yourself, “She’s hooking me because of my
nutty philosophy. And my nutty philosophy is, ‘That shit shouldn’t
be as shitty as she indubitably is!’”
HARRY:
Exactly.
ELLIS:
And then you can say to yourself, “But she should act shittily!” You
know why she should?
HARRY:
No, I don’t.
Children and Parents
223

ELLIS:
Because that’s the way she behaves! That’s her nature! Not all the
time, but some of the time. And some of the time, actually, she
deliberately does act that way, to get you going. Look how exciting it
is for her. She’s got a great game going there!
HARRY:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
Well,whyshouldn’tadolescents,teenagers,actthewaytheydo?Why
must they act the way that’s good?
HARRY:
I guess because I’m in the teaching role at this time.
ELLIS:
But why must they accept your teaching – and let’s assume your
teaching is good. Why must they?
HARRY:
They don’t have to accept it, just go along with it, while she is in the
house.
ELLIS:
O-o-h.
HARRY:
(laughter)
ELLIS:
“They’ll have to accept it! They can burn down the neighbor’s houses
but they’re not allowed to burn down my house!”
HARRY:
No, no. After they leave my house, they can burn down whose house
they please.
ELLIS:
Right. But why must they not burn down your house?
HARRY:
Because I’m trying to teach them that you don’t burn houses.
ELLIS:
I know but let’s suppose that fails. Why must you succeed in teaching
this rebellious teenager not to burn down the house?
HARRY:
It’s my responsibility to teach her.
ELLIS:
You’d better try. But why do you have to succeed? You see, you’d only
better try.
HARRY:
I don’t know that I’ll succeed or not, but I am trying.
ELLIS:
Yes, but you’re trying with hostility. That’s going to help you not
succeed. Now if we could only get you to see that there’s no reason
why she shouldn’t act that way. There’s many, many reasons why it
would be preferable. If you thought that way, you would still be
displeased and sorry. And then you could talk to her, and maybe
more effectively. You see you’re talking ineffectively because your
anger is getting in your way and she’s hearing that anger: “That
goddamn father of mine thinks I’m a shit, I’ll ﬁx his wagon!” Then
she’s going to deliberately do nasty things.
HARRY:
Exactly. That’s what happens.
ELLIS:
Do you see that you could feel disappointed without the anger? Do
you see that that’s possible?
HARRY:
Early on if I see it’s happening.
ELLIS:
No,youcanevendoitlater.Youstill,atanymoment,haveachoiceof
whetherto indulgeinyour anger,to remainangry,ortogiveitup.Do
you realize that you control your emotional destiny that she doesn’t?
HARRY:
Yes, I do.
ELLIS:
And, therefore, you could after you upset yourself still get yourself
un-angry. And then later, you can do it automatically, before you

224

anger yourself. As I told you before, you anger yourself with the idea,
“She shouldn’t be this way!” But you can give up your should and
replace it with, “I wish to hell she weren’t this way, but she is! Too
fucking bad!”
HARRY:
(laughter) She is that way right now.
ELLIS:
That’s right and in all probability will remain that way for quite a few
years.
HARRY:
Yeah.
ELLIS:
Two or three years at least.
HARRY:
Yes, exactly.
ELLIS:
And therefore if you really said, “She is that way. I wish she weren’t
but she is!” you would not get rid of all your feelings, but, instead,
you’d be left with appropriate ones. We don’t want you to say, “It’s
good behavior.” But you could accept her with her crummy behavior;
and then keep after her by saying, “You know, dear, that’s not the
right way to act, because you’re going to get in trouble. I’m not going
to allow it, I’m going to penalize you if you insist on the behavior.”
Haveyoutriedanyreinforcementsorpenaltieswithhertoencourage
her to act better?
HARRY:
Yes and no. I penalize her for not taking the trash out.
ELLIS:
And does that do any good?
HARRY:
Yes.
ELLIS:
All right. So you could use reinforcements – money, television, or
somethingelse–whensheactswell;andasetofpenalties,ifyouwantto
also do that – money, again, or whatever, when she acts poorly. She

HARRY:

ELLIS:
“One of these days, when she’s eighteen, I’ll throw her out of the
house if she continues this crummy behavior.” But un-angrily, you
see? We don’t want you to throw her out of the house on her head,
only on her ass.
HARRY:
(laughter) OK.
ELLIS:
Now do you think you could work on that?
HARRY:
But I still don’t have a technique for dealing with her even after I get
angry.
ELLIS:
By telling yourself, and you’d better go over this many, many times,
“She should act this way because she’s a typical teenager who
demands her way.” And, “She likes to upset me and that’s the
way she should be. I wish to hell she weren’t, but that’s the way
she is!”
HARRY:
OK, I realize that.
ELLIS:
But? But what? What do you also realize?
Children and Parents
225

HARRY:
That I want her to be –
ELLIS:
That she shouldn’t be that fucking way!
HARRY:
(laughter)
ELLIS:
As long as you have those two conﬂicting views, the stronger one will
win out; that she shouldn’t be that way. Now we want you to work on
having the stronger view: “She should be that way, she should badly,
wrongly, mistakenly. Because she is, right now, that way. And maybe
if I accept that, she later will act better. Maybe!” But you’re demand-
ing that right now that a thirteen year old acts like an eighteen year
old. And she’s not going to!
HARRY:
No, she’s not.
ELLIS:
You’re thinking, “She’s not, but she should!” But actually she’s not
and she should act badly, you see. Now, if you would really say to
yourself many, many times “She should act badly because she does!
Not because it’s good – too bad, tough shit!” that would be a good
technique. But you’d better go over that many times until you
convince yourself. And you sound, at this moment, much more
convincedthat“Sheshouldn’tandIhaveto,asherfather,changeher!”
How Parents Can Help Solve Problems of Their Children
Parents can be of immense help to children who experience the inevitable upsets
that occur as they grow up. They can provide comfort, security, and the love and
affectionthattellchildrenthatnotonlywillconditionsbeokay,butalsothatthey
are okay.
Parents are in an especially good position to educate their own children about
how to rationally and level-headedly deal with rejection, failure, unfairness, and
unpleasantness so that they do not overly upset themselves. For example,
parents can constantly remind children that mistake-making is a part of life
and that they need not despair if they do not succeed at everything they do. In
particular, parents can tell their children how valuable they are even when they
do not succeed, get into trouble, or experience rejection.
Ellis has discussed in his 1966 book on raising a happy child ways in which
parentscanhelptheirchildovercomespeciﬁcproblemsassociatedwithgrowing
up. What follows is a summary of the major suggestions Ellis provides parents
for helping their children overcome different emotional difﬁculties.
Overcoming childhood fears
1
If it is known that a child has a strong tendency to become
frightened by dogs, the dark, loud noises or anything else, a special
effort may be made to keep him or her out of the range of these
things.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
226

2
The easily upsetable child should preferably be kept away from
excessively fearful adults and older children.
3
If you, as a parent, happen to be imbued with a great many intense
fears, train yourself to overcome (or at least to suppress) as
thoroughly as possible these fears when you are with your child.
4
Children who are reasonably fearful of external events can fre-
quently be talked out of their fears (through repetition of rational
explanations) if those who raise them will reason with them in a
patient, kindly, and persistent manner.
5
Blaming children or making fun of them for fearfulness usually
won’t help but will tend to do them more harm than good. They
can clearly be shown that the fear is groundless and that other
children do not have it; but they have a perfect right to be wrong
and are not inferior because they cannot handle themselves in this
area.
6
Getting children to laugh through the use of humor at their own
andothers’fearsmaybeofvalueifitisdirectedattheirpanicrather
than at them.
7
It isfrequently possibleto helpthechild(throughdeconditioning)
to become pleasantly familiar with a feared object.
8
Calmness in dealing with children’s fears is one of the prime
requisites for helping them overcome these fears.
9
Don’t be deceived by children’s clever evasions of admitting their
fears. If children claim that they are not particularly afraid of other
children or animals but they simply dislike them, ask yourself
whether they are using “dislike” as a cover-up for their fears.
10
If a child’s parent has a fear, it is advisable that personal catastro-
phizing be eliminated.
Overcoming childhood anxieties and low self-esteem
1
Fully accept the fact that children have not had time to learn all the
strange rules of the adult world. Consequently, they are usually
fallible and must inevitably make innumerable mistakes that will
bother parents. Children will outlive their childishness only if they
are allowed to act it out, to learn by making mistakes, rather than
being warned of the dire consequences.
2
Learn to tolerate normal inefﬁciencies (child tying shoelaces) as
they will always exist, rather than getting angry. Displace the onus
of mistakes and failures onto the task rather than the child.
3
Do not expect that an emotionally labilechild will be problem free.
Once a child feels that others do not like him and that it is horrible
that they don’t, he or she frequently resorts to testing procedures,
deliberately acting badly to see whether his or her peers and elders
will accept him.
Children and Parents
227

4
Once you have ascertained that a child’s behavior is poor, try to
estimate what he or she is capable of doing and not doing, and
judge him or her accordingly.
5
If you honestly believe a child’s behavior is correctable, keep in
mind that change can be a very slow process; be tolerant and
patient.
6
Keep in mind that the main reason for people’s anxiety is their dire
need to be accepted, approved, or loved by all signiﬁcant people in
their lives. Show your children by example that you do not need
others’ love and that neither do they. Let them see that you are not
overly hurt by their ungracious, inconsiderate, and hostile
attitudes.
7
Avoid the sorts of family tensions that are characterized by scraps
between parents. Such ﬁghting denotes your own inability to
handle the troubles that come your way.
8
While children who are anxious about what others think of them
demandalotofpamperingandmollycoddling,itisalsoimportant
to be ﬁrm and show them that their behavior is self-defeating
(reinforce and punish accordingly).
9
Be wary of overly good behavior of youngsters. Try to discover if
they are terribly anxious about losing your and others’ approba-
tion; and, if so, get in a good counterattack on their anxiety-
creating attitude.
10
Children who are anxious tend to become upset and put them-
selves down, become embarrassed, panicky, and anxious about
being seen as anxious. Tell children that most people react to their
worry in some overexcited or withdrawing fashion and that it is
not terrible to reveal to others how afraid one is.
Overcoming children’s anger
1
First and foremost, be calm yourself. Make yourself displeased but
not enraged.
2
Remove, if you can, unnecessary frustrations from the child.
3
Make sure children are not over-tired.
4
Do not condemn or punish children for hostility when they are
unusually hostile.
5
Try to keep in mind that children’s hostility is an expression of
underlying attitudes and beliefs and that expressions of or symp-
toms of human behavior are themselves normal and even healthy.
Show them that anger arises from the sane belief, “I don’t like this
thing that is happening to me,” and the mistaken belief, “and
therefore I can’t stand it, and demand that it shouldn’t happen!”
6
At times it is wise to let children get anger out of their system.
7
Show children that they are not bad, but their ideas sometimes are.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
228

8
When there is not time to get to the very bottom of your children’s
anger, or when it is too late to start interpreting and arguing them
out of it, you can frequently use some kind of diversion as an
effective means of calming them down.
9
Try to be as fair as possible in your dealings with your children.
10
One of the main causes of children’s anger is jealousy or envy of
others. Teach the child that (a) deprivation and disadvantage is
inevitable, and (b) one can amount to something even without the
beneﬁts and advantages of others.7
Relating to Your Parents
Ellis squarely addresses the major problems that create strain between adults
and their parents. In assessing the cause of poor relationships with one’s
parents, Ellis zeros in on the emotions of “grown up” children to determine
how they may be upsetting themselves about their parents’ behavior. The main
emotional problems, which strain parent–child relationships and which, unfor-
tunately, seem to prosper in such relationships, are anger, depression, and guilt.
FromaREBTperspective,excessiveamountsofanyofthesefeelingscaninterfere
withhealthyrelationshipsbetweenchildrenandtheirparents.Toomuchangeron
the part of children may drive them away from their parents. Excessive guilt can
prevent them from acting in an assertive, constructive way. And depression,
which can arise when children believe they are not getting enough love, is
unhealthy, and can also lead, as you’ll see in a moment, to anger and hostility.
In analyzing the problem of depression and anger of “grown up” children,
Ellisstartswiththeassumptionthatthey,too,aredifferentintermsofhowmuch
love theythink theyneed(anddemand)from theirparentsandarealso different
in terms of how sensitive they are to the treatment (and amount of love) they
receive from their parents.
The following transcript reveals how Ellis disputes the demands for love and
approval of a sensitive and “needy” grown up child that because of non-
fulﬁllment, have led to depression and anger. Orv is a 28 year old, who is
discussing in a public demonstration session with Ellis the possibility of making
peace with his father.
ELLIS:
Okay, Orv, what problem would you like to start with?
ORV:
My problem is with my relationship with my dad.
ELLIS:
And what’s the bad thing about your relationship with your dad?
ORV:
Ithinktheessenceofthebadthingisthatwereallyarenotbonded,we
really never have been.
ELLIS:
And how do you feel about that lack of bond?
ORV:
Ifeelverysad,especiallynow,becausehecalledmethisweekandtold

expecting to die within the coming year. So that kind of reactivated
all of this. I’ve been using coping mechanisms, such as you’ve talked
about.
ELLIS:
Good. But are you guilty about what’s happening now, that he
probably wants more out of you and you’re not going along with his
desire? Do you feel guilt? Just sorrow, or guilt or both?
ORV:
I don’t feel very much guilt. I feel more sadness.
ELLIS:
But is it only sadness or is there some depression?
ORV:
There is not depression, there is anger. I’m mad at him for doing this.
I struggled for years to get where I wanted. I stopped doing that now
and it’s been kind of peaceful, not much communication.
ELLIS:
Right.
ORV:
Now that Poppa’s going to die, he’s reactivated all this.
ELLIS:
Yes. So if you were only sad and sorry I wouldn’t consider that an
emotional problem. If you were guilty I would, but let’s assume
you’re not. Let’s take your anger again. When you’re angry with
your father, you’re telling yourself “My father shouldn’t be doing” –
what?
ORV:
I think he’s asking me to gloss it over and tell him everything is OK. I
think he wants me to make it pleasant.
ELLIS:
And he shouldn’t be demanding that of you?
ORV:
No, he’s been more pleasant to me but I don’t want him to be asking
this.
ELLIS:
So he should leave you alone?
ORV:
Heeithershouldleavemealoneorheshouldgoallthewaywithitand
make our relationship truly good.
ELLIS:
All right. But let’s take the ﬁrst part. Why should he leave you alone?
ORV:
Because I’m still vulnerable even after all these years.
ELLIS:
True. But you’re saying, “He should make me un-vulnerable, or he
should leave me alone.”
ORV:
He should leave me alone in the non-vulnerability I have achieved.
ELLIS:
But why must he? Let’s suppose that would be nice, why must he?
ORV:
He mustn’t.
ELLIS:
“Oh, he mustn’t, but the fucker should?”
ORV:
(laughter) It’s only fair.
ELLIS:
Why should he be fair? Let’s assume he’s unfair. Why must he be fair?
ORV:
He believes in it.
ELLIS:
But why must he follow his own beliefs?
ORV:
He should. If he were a good father he would.
ELLIS:
Why must he be a good father?
ORV:
Because I need him to be.
ELLIS:
“And therefore I should run him?” Is that right?
ORV:
No.
ELLIS:
“He should be that way!”
ORV:
He should be that way.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
230

ELLIS:
Well, that would be lovely, but you’re demanding. Now why do you
need him to be a good father?
ORV:
Because in me, as I think in all of us, part of me wants to be loved,
cherished, accepted.
ELLIS:
Right.Wewant tobe.Butwhydoyouneedwhat youwant?It’savery,
very normal and human to want to be loved. But –
ORV:
But I need it.
ELLIS:
Ifyou believe thatyou’re goingto bea basketcase. It’syourbiological
tendency to want approval, love, and acceptance, especially from
your parents. But if you really think, “I must have it, I need it,
approval, from my father,” and then he doesn’t give it to you – we
know he doesn’t have to – then where is that going to leave you?
ORV:
I can live without it – in that sense I don’t need it.
ELLIS:
Ah, and can you be a happy human even if your father never gives you
anyrealloveandisapainintheassforever?Canyoustillbehappyasa
human?
ORV:
Yes, I can.
ELLIS:
Fine! Well, you see we just gave evidence that you don’t need his love.
ORV:
I can be happy but I’m aware of an emptiness and a lack when he
doesn’t love me.
ELLIS:
And why can’t you live with that emptiness and lack, if your father
won’t ﬁll it up?
ORV:
I can.
ELLIS:
Good! If you really go over that many times, “I can live with that
emptiness and lack I’ll never like it but I can gracefully lump it!” then
you’ll feel much better. And then you won’t need your father’s love.
Give up the necessity of your having it, and you’ll then feel less angry
with him, or un-angry.
ORV:
May I ask you a speciﬁc, strategic question?
ELLIS:
Sure.
ORV:
My way of dealing with this has been to minimize communication
and contact to what he has told me he is comfortable with. We just
talk about my work and the weather.
ELLIS:
Right.
ORV:
I can keep on doing this. The last communication I understood from
his was “I want more talk about your work and the weather because
that makes me feel pleasant.”
ELLIS:
Then I would advise you, for desensitization purposes, to talk to him
morerather thanlessand useyour talkingtohimasa meansofseeing,
“I do not need his approval – even though I want it.” We’re not trying
to change that at all, that value of wanting his affection. But you can
convince yourself, “I don’t need him to act differently, better, more
fatherly,eventhoughIwouldlikeit.”Therefore,invivo,whiletalking

yourself. You see? Now let’s give you a method of doing this with
rational-emotive imagery. Close your eyes and really picture him at
his worst, being contradictory, demanding things that he had better
not demand, and giving you a royal pain. Can you envision that
strongly?
ORV:
I can remember our last conversation.
ELLIS:
Fine. Now remember that vividly. That’s OK. And how do you feel
right now in your gut as you remember that?
ORV:
Manipulated and pissed.
ELLIS:
Good. Get in touch with your pissedness, because you probably
were manipulated by him and we don’t want you to change that
observation. Get in touch with your pissedness and make yourself feel
very,very pissed at him forthemanipulationandtell me when you feel
very, very pissed.
ORV:
OK, I feel it!
ELLIS:
Now,changeyourpissedness,yourangertoafeelingofrealsorriness.
Make yourself feel sorry and sad about the way your father is
behaving; but not pissed, not angry. Tell me when you only feel
sorry and sad but not angry.
ORV:
OK.
ELLIS:
Open your eyes. How did you do that? What did you do?
ORV:
Well, I was clenching my hands and I was digging my ﬁngernails into
my other hand.
ELLIS:
Yes.
ORV:
As I stopped doing that and as I let out a breath, I felt less anger and
just more acceptance of the way it is.
ELLIS:
All right, but how did you get to the acceptance? That ﬁrst part you
did will deﬁnitely get your anger away. Any kind of relaxation
technique will temporarily rid you of the anger. But how did you
get to the acceptance? What did you do to get to that, because that’s
what we want, your feeling of acceptance and sorriness.
ORV:
I remembered what I can say to myself.
ELLIS:
Yeah?
ORV:
“For 73 years he has been doing this. It is unlikely that at this last
couple of years he’s going to change. He’s not going to and I’d just
accept that he’s not going to.”
ELLIS:
Good. Your implicit philosophy will help you: “I’d better damn well
accept it because he is this way and he’s going to remain that way!”
That was very good. Will you, for the next 30 days (it only took you a
very few minutes) do this rational-emotive imagery every single day,
at leastonce a day, until you automatically startfeeling when you ﬁrst
start thinking about your father and his manipulation, accepting,
calm, and non-pissed off about it. Will you do that at least once a day
for the next 30 days, practice rational-emotive imagery until you
retrain your feelings?
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
232

ORV:
I can promise to practice working on this and getting that feeling of
acceptance. I can’t promise to ever try to like my father’s ways.
ELLIS:
You mean try to like the way he behaves?
ORV:
Right.
ELLIS:
No, we’re not trying to get you to do that. We want you to really
feel sorry and sad about his behavior, but not damning of him. So
we don’t want you to like it. In case you don’t do the rational-
emotive imagery, let’s give you reinforcement. What do you like to
do that you do almost every day in the week, something that you
enjoy?
ORV:
ThegreatestreinforcerisnotsomethingI’mgoingtosayinthisroom
in public so I’ll say another reinforcer!
ELLIS:
Yeah, right! We’ll leave out sex! What’s the other reinforcer?
ORV:
(laughter) Well, I have this new funny thing I like to do, which is to
hang upside down in the hall.
ELLIS:
Oh, that’s great! So you don’t do that for the next 30 days until after
you’ve done the rational-emotive imagery and changed your feeling
from pissedness to feeling sorry and sad. Now what do you hate to do
that you avoid doing?
ORV:
Urn, wash the toilet.
ELLIS:
That’s a very good one. If 12.00 midnight arrives during the next 30
days and you haven’t yet done the rational-emotive imagery and
changed your feeling then you stay up until1.00 a.m. washing the
toilet. If it gets too clean wash the neighbors’ toilets!
Another frequent emotion which can obstruct family harmony in its intense
form is guilt. Guilt comes from the irrational belief that “I must never do
anything to upset my parents and if I did, I would be a rotten person.” Ellis
argues that while it is generally undesirable to upset your parent, it is sometimes
inevitableinordertoachievesomethingyoureallywant,andyouarenotarotten
person for asserting yourself with your parent. Both you and your parent will
survive your frustrating behavior even though each of you may ﬁnd it tempo-
rarily unsettling. Too much guilt on the part of a child towards a parent can
inhibit a child from ever growing up, and can also lead both to resentment of the
parentsaswellasdepressioninthechildfornotbeingabletolivelifethewaythey
would wish.
In the following REBT session, Patricia, a 28-year-old single woman, dis-
cusses with Ellis her lack of assertion with her mother because of her guilt, her
feelings of depression because of her unassertiveness, and her anger with her
mother for asking too much of her.
ELLIS:
Patricia, what problem do you want to discuss?
PATRICIA:
Well, I’m kind of a wimp in my relationship with my mother and it
drives me crazy and it’s ruining all my friendships.
ELLIS:
What happens when you feel upset about your mother?
Children and Parents
233

PATRICIA:
Well, I want to do one thing and my mother won’t like it and so if I
goaheadanddoit,itwillmakehermad,andthenshewon’tlikeme
anymore. If I don’t do it then I get mad because I’m not doing what
Iwanttodo.Iusuallyendupdoingwhatshewantsmetodoandit’s
drivingmecrazy,becauseit’sruiningmylife,andthisistheonlylife
I have to live.
ELLIS:
So – you correct me if I’m wrong – you’re not as assertive as you’d
like to be. At “A” activating event, she asks you to do something
that you really don’t want to do and at “C” behavioral conse-
quences you unassertively do it, because you’re telling yourself
what at “B” your belief systems – that is driving you into lack of
assertion?
PATRICIA:
I tell myself that I can’t live without my mother’s love.
ELLIS:
Prove that. That’s a fascinating hypothesis: you can’t live without
your mother’s love. Where is the evidence that you can’t?
PATRICIA:
I know intellectually that I can live without my mother’s love but
my need for her love is still killing me.
ELLIS:
But intellectually means lightly. You see, whenever you say you
know a thing intellectually, you mean you know it lightly: “I know
lightly that I can live without my mother’s love but I know strongly
I really can’t!” You’d better acknowledge that you’re unassertive
because you think you need your mother’s love. Now how could
you give up that nutty notion, not that you like your mother’s love
– there’s nothing wrong with wanting it – but that you need it and
therefore you have to do things her way to win her love? How can
you give up that crazy notion?
PATRICIA:
I don’t know. I mean, I can recognize it intellectually but I really
don’t know. I want to tell my mother, I want to tell her, “Look
mother you’re driving me crazy!” Then she says, “Oh, you’re
messed up” orsheacts like a woundedbird orasthoughsomething
is wrong with me. I want her to realize that “Mother, I’m going to
do my thing; you do your thing.”
ELLIS:
That would be lovely if she realized it. But she’s not going to.
Suppose you have a woman friend approximately your age and
youreducationandshehasamothermuchlikeyours,nowdoesshe
need her mother’s approval? Does she?
PATRICIA:
NoIdon’tthinkshedoes.Atmyage,Icertainlyshouldnotneedmy
mother’s approval I should be an adult.
ELLIS:
Why doesn’t she need it. What is her evidence that she doesn’t need
her mother’s approval?
PATRICIA:
She’s not dead.
ELLIS:
She hasn’t dropped dead yet. What else? There’s a better reason
thanthat.Ifsheabsolutelyneededitshewoulddropdeadwithoutit.
OK. But why else doesn’t she need it?
PATRICIA:
I don’t know. She needs her own approval.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
234

ELLIS:
No, she won’t drop dead without her own approval. She doesn’t
need it because she could be a happy human without it. She
wouldn’t be as happy without her mother’s approval as with it,
for I assume she likes her mother’s approval. But couldn’t she live
an enjoyable life even if her mother didn’t approve of her?
PATRICIA:
Yes, yes I think she could. Because I think I can.
ELLIS:
How could you really live an enjoyable life if you didn’t do what
your mother wanted – you just ﬁrmly, not nastily, held your
ground and said, “No mother, you want me to ‘X,’ but I’m doing
‘Y.’” Now how could you still lead an enjoyable life?
PATRICIA:
By not saying to myself “Oh Patricia you’re such a bad daughter
because you haven’t done ‘X.’”
ELLIS:
That’s exactly right! You see, we’re now back to guilt. “If I didn’t
please my mother and she upset herself, which she well might, then
Iwouldbearottendaughter.”Nowwhyisthatfalsethatyouwould
be a rotten daughter?
PATRICIA:
Because I’m not a rotten daughter. I’m just doing what I want todo
with my life.
ELLIS:
And you’re a daughter who does some rotten things, according to
your mother. But do you only do rotten things to your mother?
PATRICIA:
I do rotten things all the time.
ELLIS:
But I mean you do some good things to your mother too, not only
rotten ones. Isn’t that right?
PATRICIA:
No, I do some good things. I’m really a pretty good kid, in fact, I’m
toogood.IwishIwereworse.IwishIcouldsay,“Forgetyou.Iwant
to do what I want to do.”
ELLIS:
But I just want to show you that you practically never would be a
rotten daughter because a rotten daughter would kill her mother,
spit in her face, and all kinds of things all the time; and you just do
some of them some of the time. Even if you were rotten at
daughtering and you were no good at being a daughter, would
you be a rotten person? Suppose you were just lousy at being a
daughter, much worse than other daughters, would that make you
a rotten person?
PATRICIA:
No.
ELLIS:
That’s right. Why wouldn’t it?
PATRICIA:
People I know, friends that I enjoy very much, are rotten children
but they’re good friends of mine.
ELLIS:
That’s right. You have good friends, people who are rotten at being
a daughter but are good at many other things. Some of the greatest
women in the world were probably rotten daughters. So you are
overgeneralizing. You’re saying “If I hurt mother by refusing to do
what she wants I’m no good as a person!” That’s crazy! Now when
you don’t go along with your mother and she feels hurt, who hurt
her?
Children and Parents
235

PATRICIA:
She did.
ELLIS:
That’s right. What did she do to hurt herself? What did she say to
herself?
PATRICIA:
She says, I don’t know exactly –
ELLIS:
She’s saying, “After all I did for her, my daughter, she should do
exactly what I want!” Is that correct? And she’s also believing, “If
my own daughter doesn’t treat me well, what does that make me as
a person?” So she’s probably putting herself down.
PATRICIA:
Well I know she plays the martyr role, the wounded bird all the
time. It just drives me crazy.
ELLIS:
Youdriveyoucrazy.Yourmothercan’tdriveyoucrazy,evenwitha
whip. I haven’t seen that done yet! What are you doing to drive
yourself crazy?
PATRICIA:
I’m saying that I’m a bad daughter because my mother is hurt.
ELLIS:
Instead of thinking “In my mother’s eyes, I’m acting badly.”
Because that is true and she is entitled to think that. Her frame
of reference is, “She’s a lousy daughter, and that makes me a lousy
mother.” But she also had better take the consequences of her
philosophy: “Because I raised this child, Patricia, she should do the
right thing and she should do my bidding!” Isn’t that what she’s
telling you?
PATRICIA:
Yes.
ELLIS:
So you could, ﬁrst, stop damning yourself when you are acting
badly in her eyes. Then second, you could force yourself to assert
yourself. Now what are some of the things you would like to do
with your mother that you don’t allow yourself to do? Give me an
example.
PATRICIA:
Because I haven’t done what I want to do with my life I want to
say to her, “Mother you did this, this, and I reacted to it this way.”
I want her to acknowledge the fact that I’m not the one who is
wrong,thatsheissometimeswrong.ButIguessIwon’tchangeher.
You know, I guess I shouldn’t want to change her because she’s
never going to change.
ELLIS:
You’d better want to change her, as long as you don’t need to
change her. And you could, if you want to experiment, say to her
exactly what you said before. “Now, look mother. I realize that all
these years I’ve been no angel. I’ve done a lot of wrong things. But
don’t you also realize that some of the things you’ve done might
not have been right?” Now we don’t know if she’ll acknowledge
that, but if you’re not hostile and you’re not upset, she might
acknowledge it.
PATRICIA:
Yes. I’d like her to acknowledge some things because they’re not all
my fault.
ELLIS:
Well that’s true. It’s not all your fault but even if it was, you don’t
have to feel guilty or self-downing. But let’s now suppose that you
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
236

continue feeling guilty. Why can’t you deal with the guilt? What
stops you from dealing with the guilt and getting rid of it – which
you could do with RET.
PATRICIA:
Well, you see, the way I deal with the guilt is to do more of what she
wants me to; and I get madder and angrier because I’m not doing
what I want to do. But I feel guilty if I don’t do her bidding and I
can’t get out of that syndrome, you know.
ELLIS:
Yes.That’sbecauseyou’vegottwonegativethingsthere.Firstofall,
you make yourself guilty: “I did the wrong thing, I hurt my mother
as I should not. Isn’t that awful! What a bad person I am!” So you
can work on that and change it to: “I’m a person who did rotten
things in my mother’s eyes but I’m entitled as a human to do that.”
But then you give in to her because of your guilt, and then you feel
guilty about you: “I shouldn’t have given in! What a wimp I am!”
Now let’s suppose you give in for the rest of your life because of
your guilt. How does that make you hopeless?
PATRICIA:
But I don’t want to give in.
ELLIS:
No, but let’s just suppose you stupidly kiss your mother’s arse for
the rest of your life. Now how does that make you no good?
PATRICIA:
If I do that I’m stupid because I’m not doing what I want to do with
my life.
ELLIS:
You’re acting stupidly. But how does that make you a stupid person
because you are acting stupidly?
PATRICIA:
I think that a person who acts stupidly is a stupid person.
ELLIS:
But why is that a wrong conclusion?
PATRICIA:
A person can act stupidly sometimes and act smart in other ways.
ELLIS:
Yes. Did Einstein act stupidly at times?
PATRICIA:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Was he a stupid person?
PATRICIA:
No.
ELLIS:
So you are at times acting stupidly. But you’d better say “I’m a
person who acts stupidly. I’m allowed to act stupidly. That’s my
nature. All humans act stupidly at times.” The most talented
humans act stupidly at times. “Too bad, how can I act less
stupidly?” And there’s an answer. Do you know what the answer
is?
PATRICIA:
Well, I want to be more assertive and I fall apart when she doesn’t
like what I do.
ELLIS:
We’rebacktoyourguilt“Imustdomymother’sbiddingorelseI’m
anogood,worthlessdaughter.AndifIdoherbiddingthenIwould
be a no good wimp! Therefore I won’t do it!” Then you blame
yourself for being unassertive. So you are in a box. There’s no way
out, because if you do your mother’s bidding you’re going to be
unassertive and a shit; and if you don’t do your mother’s bidding
Children and Parents
237

you’re going to be assertive and a shit! Now how can you win with
that philosophy?
PATRICIA:
Iwant to change my philosophy. I wanttobe assertive andthink, “I
don’t care what you feel or think!” I do though.
ELLIS:
No, no, no, that’s too strong. “I don’t care too much what you
think.”
PATRICIA:
OK, I’m not going to care so much that it’s going to ruin my
life. Because it has ruined my life in the past ﬁve years and I’m sick
and tired of it.
ELLIS:
That’s right. Now if you would really work on that, we could get
you to do several assertive things, one at a time, and force yourself
to uncomfortably do them until you become comfortable. Such as
what you said before, “Now, look mother, I’m not an angel, but I
think you may have done some wrong things too, and I would just
liketotellyouthis.AndifyouwanttofeelhurtwhileI’mtellingyou
that, that’s your prerogative. But you’d better read A New Guide to
Rational Living by Albert Ellis and Robert Harper and not feel
hurt!” So you could force yourself to say this, not feel guilty, and be
more assertive. We don’t want you to run roughshod over your
mother and not have any feelings at all – just give up feeling over-
concerned. Be concerned about your mother because you love her,
butnotover-concerned andnotwalkoneggs.Andnotputyourself
down if you ever do walk on the eggs.
PATRICIA:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Let me give you rational-emotive imagery. Close your eyes and
imaginethatyoucontinuetobenauseatinglyunassertive,justgivein
to your mother, kowtow, and don’t do what you want. Can you
vividly imagine that?
PATRICIA:
Yes.
ELLIS:
And how do you feel in your gut?
PATRICIA:
I think it’s disgusting.
ELLIS:
Make yourself feel really disgusted with yourself. Tell me when you
feel really disgusted.
PATRICIA:
I already feel really disgusted.
ELLIS:
All right. Now change that feeling and you’re still nauseatingly
unassertive, to only disappointment. Make yourself feel disap-
pointed about your behavior but not disgusted with you. Tell me
when you’re able to do that.
PATRICIA:
OK.
ELLIS:
How did you do it?
PATRICIA:
I did it by not saying, “Oh, Patricia, you’re such a shit for being so
unassertive.”
ELLIS:
And saying instead to yourself – what? How did you make yourself
feel disappointed? How did you feel un-nauseated with yourself?
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
238

PATRICIA:
I said, “My preference is that I probably would be happier if I were
more assertive so therefore I’d better be more assertive.”
ELLIS:
“And it’s too bad when I’m not?”
PATRICIA:
Too bad when I’m not assertive.
ELLIS:
Good!Now,willyoupracticethatforthenextthirtydays,untilyou
start automatically feeling disappointed when you’re not assertive.
Then get back to work on being assertive rather than feeling down.
Would you do that? And if you do that at the end of thirty days
you’re still at times unassertive, you’ll automatically tend to feel
disappointment, which is good. For we want you to feel disap-
pointment in your behavior but not disappointment in you. See?
REBT is also being increasingly used by mental health professionals (coun-
selors, psychologists, social workers) to help children and adolescents who
experience emotional and interpersonal problems. Children as young as six can
be taught rational concepts which they can use to help reduce their worries and
other bad feelings. For those professionals interested in how REBT can be used
with younger populations, the following two books may be of interest: Albert
Ellis and Michael E. Bernard’s Rational Emotive Behavioral Approaches to
Childhood Disorders (Springer) and Michael Bernard’s The REBT Therapist’s
Pocket Companion for Working with Children and Adolescents (Albert Ellis
Institute).

Death and Dying
But you had better face the real fear and “Yes, I could die, because any
damn thing I have, even pain, I could die from. There is little chance that I
will, but I could. And I am going to take care of myself as best I can and go
to the doctor when something seems wrong. But beyond that, I cannot do
anything more. Tough shit, if I die!” So you had better accept that fact if
you die, you die. Too bad. Really convince yourself that if you die, you die.
Too damned bad! Not awful not horrible! Highly unpleasant! (Ellis public
lecture)
Thereislittlequestionthatformanypeople,death,beittheirownorsomeone
close to them, is one of the most stressful events they are inevitably confronted
with. Thoughts of death bring forth a variety of human emotions that in their
most intense forms such as panic, anger, and depression can be very disruptive
to your life. Indeed, it is not uncommon for relatively healthy and young people
to be so obsessed with “the horror” of the inevitability of their own death that
they ﬁnd it extraordinarily difﬁcult to enjoy themselves in the present.
And further down towards the end of people’s life span, severe anxieties
about their impending death may prevent them from maintaining their self-
acceptance and morale in the face of death. It can prevent them from living
their last days with as much happiness and serenity as possible, and from
continuing to make rational choices about the remainder of their life.
Ellis offers some unique insights and guidance into how people can prepare
for their own death. His view concerning death is based on rational and
humanistic philosophy. His philosophical position is that it is not possible
to “make sense” out of one’s death and, therefore, it is sensible to accept that for
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness: The Legacy of Albert Ellis

all intents and purposes, we all die, and it is the end of life as we know it. His
therapy for people who experience extremely harmful emotional reactions
towards death helps to challenge their irrationalities surrounding death which
create for them needlessly intense emotional pain.
A Humanistic Conception of Death
Death, at the present time, is inevitable. The mere fact that we are born and
continue to live means that, like all forms of contemporary life, we will
deﬁnitely die. To be accorded the boon of life, we have to (until the
fountain of youth is someday – perhaps – discovered) suffer the fate of
dying. Some of us will die sooner, some later, but we all (yes, all) will die.
Youcanviewthefactthathumanshaveonlyexistedforacertainmillionsof
years, but the universe has existed for billions and billions before that and it
will, in all probability, exist for millions and millions of years after humans
no longer exist. And you, as a human, are most important to yourself. And
you’d better be, because in the universe you’re one out of billions and
billions,averysmall cog inthewheeloftheuniverse.And youaregrandiose
if you think that the universe revolves around you. (Ellis public lecture)
Consistent with humanistic philosophy is Ellis’ rejection of the concept of an
“afterlife.” He argues strongly that until there is objective evidence to support
the idea of life after death,people wouldbebetteroff concentratingon accepting
the eventuality that we all just die, exist no more, and had better live our one life
to the fullest. According to Ellis, the acknowledgement of the ﬁnality of death
without denying its inevitability enables one to concentrate on reasonable living
and on dying with dignity.
Ellis opposes a number of traditional views of death and dying, viewing them
as providing too many irresolvable and irrational questions about life and too
few certain answers about death. In western society, people continue to be
encouraged to ﬁnd answers as to why they die, when they’ll die, where they’ll go
when they die, and what place they have in the universe. While many religions
help to provide answers to these questions as well as help people to accept death
as normal, their general emphases are more on death, than life, on life after
death, and on living so that life after death in Heaven or elsewhere is guaranteed.
This focus on death can direct people away from living life to its fullest.
Additionally, Ellis considers the recent advance in science as having the
potential for dehumanizing the dying process. He agrees with the position that
as technology brings about the possibility of increasing control and mastery of
one’s life and death, it also increases the obsession with the lack of control we
presently have over our ﬁniteness. One of the irrational beliefs born from
current technology is that “I must have total control over all events in the
universe, and without having perfect control, not only is it impossible to be
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
242

happy, but also, I am helpless and hopeless.” Ellis sees the striving for control in
all areas of our life as making it difﬁcult to accept the lack of control over our
death.
The humanistic position argued by Ellis is that of accepting that we do not
need to have total control over our lives to be happy and worthwhile. It is quite
possible to live life to its fullest while accepting dying as perfectly natural,
normal, uncontrollable, and inevitable. He also believes that it is irrational to
obsess about questions of death and our place in the universe because of the
unavailability of ultimate answers. In addition, Ellis believes that people’s
search for existential answers tends to be obstructed by their psychological
“need” (which Ellis calls ego) to have a special place in the grand scheme of the
universe.
However, as Ellis notes, the universe does not care one way or another for our
“immortal souls.” Rather than desperately searching for how you belong to
some universal entity or process, it would be more productive to concentrate
on accepting yourself without demanding that your self, or self-deﬁnition, or
happiness can only be attained when your place in the universe is understood or
guaranteed.
Rational Living with Dying
Ellis maintains that when people become overly upset about their death, they
irrationally maintain a number of beliefs.
While it is very appropriate to feel extremely sad and concerned, for the death
of yourself or another, it is not necessary to feel overwhelmingly depressed and
anxious. Perhaps, the main irrationality about death is “Death and dying are
awful,horrible,andterrible,and,therefore,dyingshouldnotexist.”Asyou’llsee
inthetranscriptthatfollows,Ellisforciblychallengesaperson’sideathatdeathis
horrible by showing people that while death is bad because it terminates one’s
life, it is only the thoughts of horror that makes death so horrible.
Another set of beliefs which help create excessive anxiety about death stem
from a person’s grandiosity, which is the belief that because one is more special
than anyone else in the universe, conditions in life should be designed so that
one gets what one wants when one wants it, and never gets what one doesn’t
want. Grandiose beliefs about one’s elevated place in the universe include: (1) “I
shouldn’t have to die,” (2) “I must have a 100 percent guarantee that I won’t die
tomorrow,” (3) “I should be able to control things so I don’t die,” (4) “Death
should not be this way for me (or my loved one) and I will not let it happen
because it is so unfair and terribly sad, and makes me feel lonely and fearful,”
(5)“BecauseIhaveledsuchagoodlife,Ishouldnotsuffer.”Ellischallengesthese
notions by asking people to prove that they must have what they deserve (life),
that somehow the universe should single them out for special treatment, and
that death is anything more than normal, though unfortunate.
Death and Dying
243

Another irrational idea of people that tends to create unnecessary and intense
anxiety about death is “I must be perfectly safe and secure at all times and
especially free of any symptom suggestive of death.” If this idea remains
unchallenged, then it is more than likely that people as they grow older will
become overly vigilant about their physical condition and will tend to horrify
themselvesanytimetheyexperienceanynon-fatedphysicalproblem.Ellisshows
that while it is certainly preferable to be free from physical problems, to demand
a permanently problem-free life is unrealistic (physical problems are inevitable)
and will only cause needless emotional suffering.
The following therapy session conducted by Ellis is with a 55-year-old male,
Charles,whohasafearofdyingofcancer.Charles,anarchitect,hasbeenplagued
for as long as he can remember with the “horror” of death and, in particular, his
physical ailments.
ELLIS:
What’s happening with you?
CHARLES:
Well, I had a reasonably good week. I read something of yours that
really seems applicable.
ELLIS:
What was that?
CHARLES:
I’m not sure which one of the things, I think it was in an interview
where somebody said “Isn’t your philosophy so what?” And you
explained that “so what” is like a half-truth, there is still the
obligation of living well. I think I have got to a point where, for
good stretches of time, I feel “so what” about the possibility of my
growingdemise,butunderneaththatisthesensethat,yes,itisgoing
tohappenandthereisnothingIcandoaboutthat.IfeelsadandIfeel,
essentially, brain washed, which is not very wonderful. In other
words, I have done some work to accept the possibility but the
possibility of death is converted in my own thinking, to well,
a certainty of course. And therefore that just, you know, poisons
my ability to live very joyfully except when I work. I am having the
best time in my life designing modern homes that I have ever had,
and that just doesn’t seem to change with anything.
ELLIS:
Because you get distracted when you work and you just throw
yourself into working.
CHARLES:
Well, I think so. I mean, I don’t know what it is. I have never had
such an easy time working in my life.
ELLIS:
You probably decided not to procrastinate anymore.
CHARLES:
I don’t procrastinate with my work anymore.
ELLIS:
Yes.
CHARLES:
I don’t procrastinate when I work, I procrastinate in every other
part of my life, but I don’t when I work.
ELLIS:
Fine. That’s good. Now you see that you cannot only get rid of your
poor thoughts, your self-defeating prospects of death, but you don’t
have to have this “so what?” attitude. You can go and look for greater
enjoyment. Is that right?
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
244

CHARLES:
I know what I need to do, or I would like to do. I would like to live
like a normal person, as a person, who, if it happens (death) it
happens. But I want to get on with my life and get some kicks out of
it. I think, too, that I’ve found myself lingering over less physical
everyday terror that I’m obsessed about. The last time we talked of
the possibility of me going to work in a hospice. I walked out and
thought that was a really interesting idea but I can’t do that.
ELLIS:
Because?
CHARLES:
It is too terrifying.
ELLIS:
Well there, you see, you’re cementing the idea that it would be
terrifying. Every time you avoid a situation like that, you build up
the notion, “If I did it, it would be awful! It would be terrifying!” So
yournon-doingconﬁrmsyourphobia.Butitwouldbebetterifyou
really forced yourself to do some of these so-called terrible things
and if you die of them we’ll give you a great funeral. Flowers and
everything!
CHARLES:
(laughter) I’ve also gone through a period where I sat with a friend
of mine who was dying of cancer for six weeks. I mean that was
pretty miserable. It was probably too close.
ELLIS:
What do you mean, “too close”?
CHARLES:
Well, he was a really close friend of mine, so I couldn’t divorce
myself from the feeling of “This really is a guy I have shared a lot of
life with.” And I mean, the transference from myself to him was
automatic, whereas with somebody else I knew less intimately that
wouldn’t happen.
ELLIS:
True, but you better have the thought, “This person is very close to
me and therefore I deplore very much his being in this condition,
and I would deplore very much my being in it.” If you said that
you’d still be caring. But then you could still add, “If I am in that
condition, Iam. Itis unlikely I willbe, but if Iam, Icould live with it
or die with it.”
CHARLES:
Well it seems, I mean, the point that I come to, the place that makes
“so what?” possible, is that everybody is going to face it, including
little old me – that I have no special dispensation from anybody.
ELLIS:
Right. You don’t know what kind of death you’re going to have but
you do know you’re going to die.
CHARLES:
Right.
ELLIS:
And you had better accept that. And the thing you wouldn’t really,
really, really, like would be very great pain in dying; and then, as
we’ve said before, you always do have the choice of killing yourself.
CHARLES:
Sometimes I think that if I work in a hospice, I will bring it on.
ELLIS:
You’ll bring what on yourself?
CHARLES:
Death.
ELLIS:
Oh well, you see, but that is a superstition.
CHARLES:
I know it, I know it.
Death and Dying
245

ELLIS:
You know it, but you don’t know it that well. Now let’s dispute that
superstition. If you work in a hospice, how will that Grim Reaper
know it and single you out sooner? Well, what’s going to happen?
CHARLES:
Well, there’s no possibility.
ELLIS:
Well, you had better really believe that, you see, because you’re
making again, as we said last time, a magical connection.
CHARLES:
ThemagicalconnectionIthinkisthatthemoreIthinkaboutdeath,
the more I dwell on it, the more likely I am to bring it on myself,
which is how a lot of different people think about it.
ELLIS:
Well, but they are partly wrong, partly right. If you worry about
having anulceryou mightbring onanulcer. Butifyou worryabout
having cancer, there is no evidence that you are going to get cancer.
If you have cancer, and you don’t worry about, you really accept it,
you will lead a better life. But that doesn’t mean that you will live a
lotlongerwithit.Sodon’tthink,“IfIthinkaboutit,I’llbringiton.”
On the contrary, it is just the opposite, because let’s suppose your
hypothesis were true; that by thinking about death that you
brought it on faster – cancer or whatever. Well, your upsetting
thought would not be the thought about death. It would be the
thought about the horror of it. And by facing and getting rid of the
horror, you could then think about it as much but horribilize
yourself about it less. And the horror would be the thing to get rid
of. So by facing death, as by working in a hospice, you can give up
the horror. Then, after a while, you don’t even think about it that
much. You see it is your horror that makes your thought obsessive.
CHARLES:
Right. That’s true. The things that trigger off the horror are just
amazing to me. Like the smallest little things can trigger off the
horror.
ELLIS:
Right. Such as?
CHARLES:
Well, if I read for a long period of time and watch the tube, one of
my eyes gets a little more out of whack than the other, so I say
“That’s it, there it goes. There’s that spot in my eye. Ah, that’s the
end of me.”
ELLIS:
Yes.
CHARLES:
Yes, and I know it’s not the end, but I assume –
ELLIS:
You know it lightly.
CHARLES:
But I’m like the frog in the Goddamned laboratory when they
throw the switch.
ELLIS:
Well no, that is not quite true. Because you see, the frog in the
laboratory when they throw the switch, the switch hits the frog’s
nerve ending and there is no way it’s going to jump.
CHARLES:
Well, the thoughts hit the nerve ending.
ELLIS:
Well, but the thoughts are thoughts of horror. They are not
thoughts about cancer, about dying. They’re thoughts of horror.
Now those you control. You’re inventing, creating those thoughts
of horror, and if you would many times look those thoughts in the
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
246

eye and prove to yourself that it is not horrible to die – to have
cancer, or anything like that – if you could strongly believe that
your death is too bad, not “so what” and that you’re going to die
anyway, and “Even if though it would be bad for me to die sooner,
tough shit!” then, after a while, your horror would go away and
your obsessive thoughts will decrease.
CHARLES:
You know, one of the things that is interesting to me is where this
horror comes from. What is its origin?
ELLIS:
Do you think there are many people who don’t have it?
CHARLES:
No, I mean it is as common as two arms and two legs.
ELLIS:
Right. But let’s get to the original grandiose thought, because all
human disturbances are really grandiosity. Now what’s the
original grandiose thought that people have which create
horror about cancer, death, brain tumors, or whatever it is?
What do you think their demand is?
CHARLES:
The demand is that I should be safe forever and not be touched by
anything difﬁcult, ever in life.
ELLIS:
Right!And“evenifIacceptdeathitshouldbeeasyevenattheageof
98!”Nowdoyouseethat’swhereitcomesfrom–chutzpah,hubris?
“I have to have a guarantee that I will never really suffer anything
outstanding. I will have minor suffering but nothing major. And it
won’t lead at a young age to anything like death.” Now why
shouldn’t humans have death? That’s hubris!
CHARLES:
Normally, they should because all they know is their own ego
center, their own self-identity, and any passage beyond that is
impossible to deal with.
ELLIS:
You see, the universe doesn’t have a should in it. There are no
absolute shoulds or oughts, just is. The universe accepts what is; and
if there were a god, that god would presumably accept what is.
That’s it. So the moral is – do not deify, sacredize the importance of
death. Your dying is important to you, but not to the universe.
CHARLES:
I get upset if death is in close proximity.
ELLIS:
Because it reminds you of you.
CHARLES:
Yes, I know.
ELLIS:
Yes, and that’s what it usually means to people. I think that people
mainly cry at funerals not for the dear beloved who is dead and
won’t feel anything. But they know someday they’re going to die
and isn’t that awful!
CHARLES:
Yes.
ELLIS:
Hubris!
CHARLES:
Yes, that’s true. I mean, it’s the training of yourself though, toreally
see it. It’s so clear, it’s so crystal clear.
ELLIS:
It’s crystal clear but non-acceptable. Now the problem is to make
that clear thing very acceptable to you. Because you deny it, you
don’t want to hear about the reality of death.
Death and Dying
247

CHARLES:
Ikeeplooking forways outofit.Thesolutionsthat Iwant,thecures
that I want, are literally ways around it rather than through it.
ELLIS:
Right. Because basically you are saying “I won’t accept it, I should
runthefuckinguniverse!Itshouldnotgoonwithoutme.Therefore,
I must not die!”
CHARLES:
Right.
ELLIS:
Lots of luck! Once you give up your grandiosity then you’ll accept
thefactthatyou’regoingtodie,youdon’tknowwhen,butyouwill.
Too bad! Now how can you enjoy your living? Because, ironically,
when you’re horriﬁed about death you’re not going to enjoy living!
CHARLES:
That’s right, that’s right. And also I’m very superstitious, I’ve
always been superstitious, always looking for superstitious
crutches.
ELLIS:
Because, ask yourself what’s the goal of superstition? It has a goal.
Do you know what the goal is?
CHARLES:
I think it conﬁrms the fact that I’m especially annoyed and have to
avoid annoying things.
ELLIS:
And, in addition to that, to invent certainty, to invent absolute
control. “IfIfollow theruleofnotbreaking mirrors or knocking on
wood, then I will be certain of safety. I’ll create a set of rules,
superstitiousrules,thatIcancompletelyfollow,andthenI’llbesafe
forever.”
CHARLES:
That’s right.
ELLIS:
But let me just relate what happened to me as a kid. I was about
eight years of age and I went to public school that had little tiny
steps. Because they had kindergarten kids up to eighth graders in it,
sothebig kidscould taketwostepsata timeandthelittlekidscould
only take one step. Because I was taller than most of the students, I
could take two steps at a time even when I was only eight years of
age. So I created a superstitious rule that I had to take an equal
number of two steps and one step. Thus, if a ﬂoor had 30 small
steps, I would always take 10 single steps and 10 double steps, to
make up the thirty. I really kept to this for one year and then I
abandoned my personal superstition. You see, I invented that.
Nobody told me to follow that superstition; I knew about walking
under ladders and at ﬁrst avoided them. You see, we have a human
predispositiontofollowsuperstitions.Ontheotherhand,Irealized
at about nine or ten that some superstitions were obviously stupid.
For example, walking under a ladder when a ladder is against the
wall. Now what can happen to you? How can the ladder fall on you
and give you bad luck? So I deliberately walked under ladders when
they were against the wall. People said you’re going against the
superstition. I replied “But nothing can happen to me if I do.” So I
talked myself out of all superstitions. Because I realized that
superstitions like arbitrarily taking two steps every time you

take a single one needlessly restrict you. So why restrict yourself?
There are enough necessary restrictions that life puts on us, now
why add these gratuitous ones? The answer is because we get
certainty. But it is a false certainty that only exists in our heads.
CHARLES:
That seems to be the deepest need of man, certainty.
ELLIS:
Yes, perfect certainty, perfect safety – which does not exist. Now,
many times over, you’d better prove to yourself that there is no
certainty.
REBT can help people who are death-phobic to realize feasible life options by
disputing the horribleness of limiting circumstances. RET can teach people how
to die without undue whining and wailing by showing them how to confront
death as a normal dimension of the life process.

Rational Living in an Irrational World
You can live a decidedly self-fulﬁlling, creative and emotionally satisfying
life even in our highly unsatisfactory world. 10
One of Ellis’ favorite topics which he has over the years been invited to present
at his public lectures throughout the United States and abroad is “Rational
Living in an Irrational World.” In a transcript of one of these public talks, Ellis
begins with a detailed overview of the many irrationalities of our present
society.
Let me go back at least for a few minutes, for I’m not going to spend much
time – because I could spend a few hours or a few days – describing some of
the un-niceties or the irrationalities of the world. These have been in existence
for many centuries, most of them. Some of them are a lot worse today, some
are even a little better today, but they continually exist and I’m just going to go
through them very brieﬂy to show you what an irrational, what a quite
deplorable world in many ways exists.
And I’m not going to cite you the evidence on these because I’ve been
collecting it for many years, about 25 now, and so far I forget how many
volumes it would take to print it, at least ﬁve, maybe ten. I may never publish
it because it’s too voluminous and a few other people have published
something on it years ago. Many years ago Walter B. Pitkin wrote a book,
I think in 1929, called The History of Human Stupidity. It’s a very thick
volume. And since that time there have been several other books. A fellow by
the name of Paul Tabori in the late 1960s wrote one called The Art of Folly and
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness: The Legacy of Albert Ellis
 Michael E. Bernard
Published 2011 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

another one on stupidity, very well documented; and every once in a while
another one comes out with a somewhat similar title and certainly with
a similar subject matter. But let me just remind you – and I think this will just
be a reminder – of some of the irrationalities that exist in the world. These are
not necessarily in order but I’ll go through some of the more important ones
ﬁrst, because they actually interfere with human survival, let alone human
happiness, and then go through the others that we survive with but survive
miserably.
The ﬁrst one probably is war, and war is still very much with us but not
necessarily in the old form. Today, we have very few declared wars. At least,
countries were honest in the old days and they formally declared wars. Now
we tend to have undeclared ones. Just the other day in the New York Times,
opposite the editorial page, a writer pointed out – I thought quite accurately –
that today there really isn’t that much war in the old sense, especially a world
war. But it’s a matter of smaller kinds of sort of undeclared violence, which,
oddly enough, get sort of sanctioned and legalized, like guerrilla warfare.
You’d be surprised how many countries at the present time have a great deal
of guerrilla warfare. But we have the Irish ﬁghting the Irish and the Arabs
ﬁghting the Jews. And many other peoples! All over the world we have a great
deal of political violence even though technically we don’t have any major
wars going on.
We have political suppression, which is a form of violence. About 30 or
40 countries, including of course the Soviet Union and China, and several
mideast countries use all forms of political suppression, including torture,
murder, and assassination. In our own country we don’t have that kind of
suppression exactly yet. We don’t certainly have torturing of political victims
very often but of course we have other kinds of violence including, in my own
lovely city of New York, murder and rape that has increased in recent years.
Then the next thing on the list of course, we have political skulduggery. Now
we’ve had it for time immemorial and it surprised me somewhat that people
were so shocked by Watergate because Watergate is the human condition.
Yet, everybody started whining and wailing about Nixon and Watergate.
Well, people who didn’t know Nixon acted thuggishly were pretty obtuse to
begin with. I ﬁnd it very surprising that people wailed about it so much
because in the United States politicians are normally corrupt. There are few of
them who have never been. In the case of practically every reform movement
that ever got into power, you come around two, three, four, or ﬁve years later
and it’s abysmally corrupt.
The same thing, incidentally, goes for labor unions. They’re very pure and
honest when they’re young and impassioned. But as soon as they get into
power, get ensconced, then they often engage exactly in the same kind of
corruption, sell-out, and skulduggery that everybody else does. This as I said,
goes on all the time and it’s surprising that people are so startled by graft and
corruption. They’ve forgotten we had a Boss Tweed many years ago and had
innumerable other dishonest politicians.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
252

People have already forgotten about the Harding scandal, the great “teapot
dome” scandal. Signiﬁcantly, Republicans, again, were caught stealing, but
that may have been accidental. The Democrats apparently don’t get caught as
often!
Then, we have in our own day and age, of course, a great deal of pollution
and ecological neglect. Now we’ve had ecological neglect for centuries but now
we’re noticing it, that it gets dramatized. We still haven’t too much over-
population in the United States but in several other important countries, like
India, there is a terriﬁc population explosion, at the enormous expense of the
vast majority of the population in these countries.
We have addiction with us. Again, a few years ago everybody was whining
and wailing about the hippies and drug addiction in the United States. Well,
there’s virtually no community, civilized or uncivilized, which hasn’t had
enormous amounts of addiction.
They haven’t necessarily had heroin or cocaine, so they had morphine or
opium instead. Everything that human beings could possibly get addicted
to they normally do. Millions of people in the world, for example, who are
quite uncivilized and don’t read advertisements have been on beetle nut for
centuries. Cocaine came from South America where they’ve been chewing the
cocaine leaves for many years. Alcohol practically ruined the American
Indians and innumerable white pioneers. Alcohol right now causes more
psychological, physical, and other damage than probably any substance in the
United States, far more than does marijuana and heroin. Human beings are
addictable; that’s the kind of animal they normally are. If they aren’t addicted
to one thing it will be another. If it’s not ups it’s downs. If it’s not downs it’s
upsand if it’s not ups or downs, it’s middles! People inevitably ﬁndsomething
to get addicted to.
Child rearing has been the scandal of the human race since just about the
beginningoftime.WehaveaquaintnotionintheUnitedStates,butpractically
every other group that’s ever known has the same quaint notion, that just
because you beget a child biologically you know something about raising that

We’ve had, all over the world in virtually every time and clime, immense
amounts of asinine gambling. Almost all gambling is asinine and especially
Rational Living in an Irrational World
253

betting on races – where you obviously won’t win. If you go to Las Vegas or
Atlantic City, the cards and all the games are clearly stacked against you. It
would be almost a miracle if you kept on winning. But not thousands, not
hundreds of thousands, but millions upon millions of Americans are addicted
to gambling. I just came through Chicago and got a copy of the Chicago
Tribune and there on the front page is the big expose of the numbers racket in
Chicago, which I found, a little to my surprise, is the largest in the nation. I
thought New York was the biggest, but apparently Chicago, with a smaller
population, has a bigger numbers racket. But that again is what humans do,
they gamble all over the place.
I could say a few words on another big facet of society but maybe I’d better
not because it’s so gruesome, and that’s our educational system. Ours in
New York is a complete shambles. It does everything except educate – unless
you call poor education and I suppose it is. We’re training people to do the
wrong things – which is a form of education. Our educational system has
always been pretty bad in the United States even at best, but we had a
reasonably good one years ago in New York City. But now it’s a shambles
partly because of the racial ﬁghts and also lots of economic retrenchment. All
over the country, you get the same complaints about the educational system.
It’s not bad everywhere but it’s hardly good. And the thinking and the
behavior of the younger generation largely depends on it.
Then we have economics, “big aspect of life,” and that is organized both in
the Soviet Union and in the United States, as mostly everywhere else in the
world, very crummily. Just to quote you a little statistic, for example, in the
United States in this day and age we still spend more money on greeting cards
than on medical research. That’s a typical statistic and you can duplicate that
by the hundreds to show what we spend money on. We spend it on all sorts of
silly things and very, very important things get short shrift. And of course
economics in the United States is largely used for status seeking. It’s not used
for food, clothing, and shelter – that’s on the side – but most people are more
interested in getting money to buy the $200,000 house that they can’t afford
more to impress the neighbors than to live in a comfortable habitat. A very
comfortable house becomes a secondary thing, and we use real estate for
status reasons.
In the United States and all over the world we still have innumerable
asinine rituals of all kinds. And I’ll just mention two that have come into the
public notice recently because of two popular books. One is weddings. I don’t
know how many billions upon billions we spend asininely these days on
weddings that people can’t afford. The other is funerals. At least the wedding
has a little rationale because supposedly it’s a happy event. But we spend on
funerals billions upon billions of showy dollars, as if the dead person really
gives a shit.
We have things like fashion going on where they arbitrarily change the
modes every few years, so you are persuaded to throwaway a few hundred
dollars’ worth of clothing, which haven’t worn out at all. But you wouldn’t be

seen dead, of course, in last year’s fashions. With men, the horrible goof is to
wear last year’s width of tie. It would be a crime if they’re now having wide ties
and you had a narrow one, which you have had for thirty years and it still
wears very well. But you wouldn’t dare go out with that sort of thing around
your neck!
We believe in all kinds of magic especially, today, astrology. Unbelievably,
almost every large American newspaper has a daily astrology column. We
have lots of mediums in this country. We have this utter nonsense about Edgar
Casey and his talking to animals – pure ﬁction made up by and believed
devoutly by screwballs of the worst sort. And I will practically guarantee that
for the next two hundred years Edgar Casey’s disciples will be digging up
presumed scripts of his that tell about contemporary conditions. But these
devout believers will have written them themselves and palmed them off as
being Edgar Casey’s. People unscrupulously do this. Harry Houdini spent
practically his whole life unmasking mediums and now we’ve got an upsurge
of mediums again. There’s a famous story I like to tell sometimes – I’ll tell it
brieﬂy about Sir Oliver Lodge who was a Nobel Prize winner in Physics
around 1912, one of theﬁrst, and his son Raymond waskilled in World War 1.
About 1919 after the war he got hold of a famous medium in London and she
brought Raymond back and they had long conversations, Oliver Lodge and
Raymond. Raymond told them exactly what heaven was like and all kinds of
things he was doing there. And Sir Oliver Lodge was thrilled and then, I think
it was Houdini or some other magician, came along and unmasked her
completely, showed she was an arrant fake, had deﬁnite proof of her harlotry.
And Sir Oliver Lodge, Nobel Prize winner in Physics, refused to accept the
evidence. This is the way human beings operate.
We have self-defeating habit patterns, almost all of us. I would almost say
that the vast majority of humans have foolish habits, such as smoking, over-
eating, alcoholism, and serious procrastination. Most of the population in the
United States, I would say over 50 percent over the age of 40, deﬁnitely over-
eat. Wrong eating, which we’re beginning to learn a little about now is
pandemic. And, incidentally, typical of humans, as soon as they learnt that
certain foods are devitalized or harmful, they immediately go to the other
extreme and frantically subscribe to “health foods” of dubious value and
considerable harm. The evidence shows that utter devotion to “natural” foods
is probably just as crazy as devotion to white bread. White bread may be
a little better for many people than some of the “natural” foods and much
less expensive.
Then we have all kinds of suggestibility. I mentioned the fashions, which
stem from suggestibility; but we also have fads of all kinds in addition to
fashion.
We have advertising, which is nothing but pure suggestibility. Ads give
a clever name and presentation to a toothpaste that has exactly the same
important ingredients as every other toothpaste. But they put on a powerful
campaign and people start demanding that toothpaste.
Rational Living in an Irrational World
255

We have revivals these days of the old time religions. The modem religion is
bad enough it really is vague and unrealistic. I’m not going to spend my time
on religion because I could give you a full talk on its irrationalities. But the old
time religions, the fundamentalists, the creationists, the Holy Rollers, and the
Jesus freaks are really dogmatic and disturbed. Yet, they’re getting revived all
over the place as never they were before.
We have a whole slew of sex myths and stupidities of which I’ll mention
just a few. We are still bigoted against premarital sex relations when
obviously it’s one of the best training grounds for marital sex relations. If
you want experience get experience! Practice makes perfect in sex as in
anything else! But we oppose this and have enforced monogamy. Monogamy
is okay as a preference. We really don’t have monogamy, we have monogyny.
Monogamy means once for a lifetime. Hell, who marries once for a lifetime
these days? We have monogyny, which means one mate at a time or serial
polygamy. But the problem is that we force it on everybody. We don’t
espouse it as a matter of choice. It you like a one-to-one relationship and not
screwing around on the side, stick to that goal. But don’t force anybody else
to stick to it. But we’re not that sane. We do force everybody else. We still
have laws against bigamy and the poor Mormons are not even allowed to
have three or four wives any more. They have it extra-legally sometimes, but
they’re not allowed to be polygamous legally. So we have enforced
monogamy.
We still have sexism as the women’s liberation movement rightly points
out. We still have a double standard of sexual morality and also have
a nonsexual double standard. Women are still vastly discriminated against,
less than they were 20 or 30 years ago, but they still suffer enormous economic
and other discrimination. Then we have much sex censorship, as witness the
recent Supreme Court decision about obscenity, just when we were getting
a little enlightened sexually. Our highest judges have now miserably fallen on
their faces and set up the rule that any local community can declare anything
obscene when the local bigots vote it to be obscene. It’s a very crazy rule!
So these are some but not all of the major aspects or irrationality in the world
according to Ellis. The question that he poses is whether you have to be
miserable. Ellis takes the view that you do not have to be overly upset and
that if you look at the core of your own irrationality and minimize it, you can
even live in this crazy world and not be utterly delighted, but not be depressed,
anxious, or hostile to others.
According to Ellis nothing in the universe is in itself upsetting. As Ellis’ ABCs
of REBT remind us, what happens to you or in the world around you (activating
events) does not directly cause people to feel anything in particular (emotional
consequence). Rather, people’s beliefs about the activating event lead to their
upset. Whether they rationally or irrationally interpret what happens will
determine the type and intensity of the emotional upset and emotional stress
they experience.

Awfulizing is the human condition. All human beings, to my knowledge,
awfulize and they don’t do it because their nutty mothers taught them how
to do it. They do it because they were born as well as reared with a tendency to
take their mothers (and themselves) too seriously. Any sane person knows
that his mother is pretty crazy and is not to be taken very seriously but human
beings don’t. I ﬁgured out at the age of seven that my mother was off her
rocker and I never took her seriously and, therefore, I became the favorite son.
My poor brother and sister took her very seriously and fought with her all her
life. But the point is that humans are suggestible, gullible, conditionable by
their mothers, their fathers, and I happen to think, along with Eric Fromm
and some others, distinctly by their culture. They go to crummy romantic
movies and they see the daytime serials on television, and then they look at the
ads in between, and if they take some of that stuff with one iota of credibility,
they’re cooked. But it’s their tendency, it’s a human tendency, to believe
unrealistic standards. And then, when people perceive that the world is pretty
crummy in many respects, they awfulize about it.
Now let me be more speciﬁc. Let’s suppose you or I do perceive that the
world is execrable in many respects. We don’t merely say to ourselves, “Isn’t
that fascinating! Since I live in a crummy society, what can I do about it? Or if I
can’t do much about it, how can I live happily in spite of it?” That would be
sanity, but instead we make some crazy conclusions. We tell ourselves, ﬁrst of
all, “Because that front-page news is bad, as it very frequently is, it’s awful, it’s
horrible, it’s terrible. I can’t stand those wars, muggings, Watergate affairs, and
superstitions.”
Now, it’s not awful, terrible, and horrible. There are few things in the
universe that are awful and terrible and horrible, if we deﬁne our terms clearly.
The only things that exist in the universe are things that are obnoxious,
deplorable, a pain in the ass. Bad things exist, and they exist by virtue of a value
system that we bring to situations.
You normally start with the values and desires – especially “I want to live. I
want to live happily. I want to get along with members of my social group and
not end up in jailor be ostracized completely. I want to intimately relate to
a few people.”
Those are your values; and virtually all humans, no matter where they are
raised or what parents they had subscribe to somewhat similar values. These
desires and goals are probably biologically inﬂuenced. You probably don’t
have to have them but you generally tend to have them, being human.
Then as corollaries of these basic values, you rationally conclude that it’s
obnoxious, it’s a pain in the ass, it’s deplorable and sad, when you see all those
dreadful things in the newspapers and on TV. When you read them asbad and
uncomfortable because those irrationalities will probably cause you and your
loved ones to be less surviving and happy. Another atomic war or two and we
may well not survive at all! And with non-atomic wars, you’ll survive but not
be too happy. Also, if there’s enough corruption, scandal, pollution, popula-
tion explosions, etc. you won’t be very happy. So far, you’re here, you’re alive,
Rational Living in an Irrational World
257

but we don’t even know for how long. And if you do stay here with these
irrationalities for 75 or 80 years you won’t be that happy. So, therefore, you
conclude rationally, empirically, on the basis of your chosen values – to live,
to be happy – and on the basis of the evidence that you see, that life is
somewhat crummy, it’s often deplorable, sad, unfortunate, not so good.
And you feel, at point C, what I call an emotional consequence: you feel
sorry, regretful, frustrated, annoyed, and irritated. If you’re wise, you’ll use
those negative feelings as motivation to try to change your environment, to
try to make it a little less crummy than it now is. And if you don’t succeed,
which you probably won’t very much – I’ve tried for a number of years to
make the world less crummy and I haven’t succeeded that well. So probably
you won’t. Even then you can conclude “Well, I did my damnedest. I did my
best. It’s still unfortunate that conditions are often this way. But that’s the way
it is – unfortunate. Period.”
Now, when you awfulize you go beyond that and tell yourself, instead “It’s
horrible, awful and terrible!” You then mean several things, all of which are
clearly unprovable and which any self-respecting Martian with an IQ of 100
could easily see through. But you don’t recognize your own nonsense because
you’re human and human means nutty.
When you awfulize, you mean, ﬁrst “Things are all bad.” You look at wars,
corruption, and other difﬁculties and you conclude awfulizing, “It’s all bad,
it’s 100 percent bad.” Well, it’s not all bad. Even Hitler wasn’t all bad, he may
have been 99 percent bad but you could ﬁnd one percent goodness even in
Hitler. You can always ﬁnd something that’s not so bad in the universe. But
when you awfulize you magically jump from “It’s quite bad. It’s very bad, it’s
mainly bad,” to “It’s all bad,” which it practically never could be. It’s almost
impossible to be 100 percent bad – because things, including torture, could
even be worse.
The second thing you do when you awfulize, is to convince yourself “It’s
more than bad.” Because that’s what the word awful, terrible or horrible really
means, if you stop and think about it. Few psychotherapists have ever stopped
and thought about this. They’d rather feel than think! But I gave some
thought to it years ago and I realized what the word awful meant. It clearly
means (1) It’s bad, which is a veriﬁable value; (2) it’s all bad, which is not very
veriﬁable; and (3) it’s more than 100 percent bad, it’s at least 101 percent bad.
Now that’s horseshit, for how can anything be 101 percent bad. But that’s
what you often believe when something really dreadful happens. You deﬁne it
as awful, meaning more than 101 percent bad. And your deﬁnition is magical
and unprovable. Because even very bad things are still only probably 80 or
90 percent bad, and hardly 100 percent.
And then the next thing your awfulizing means is “Because it’s so bad, it
shouldn’t exist! Hitler, Watergate, pollution, fads, fashions, superstitions,
myths, dogma, absolutely must not exist!” Well that’s a nutty statement
because you suddenly make yourself Jehovah. Every time you use a dogmatic
should or a must, a command, rather than a strong preference or wish, you
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
258

think and act crazily – meaning humanly. Because you’re demanding, you’re
whining that whatever you really want has to exist and that things that you
abhor must not exist. Well, lots of luck!
You’re not going to make it! That’s what you do when you awfulize, you
command, you act in a godlike manner. And your awfulizing also includes
the belief, “Because it’s so deplorable, and unfortunate, I can’t stand this
badness.” Of course you can stand the badness! You’re going to stand it for
80 or 90 years like my poor nutty mother did, and make yourself anxious or
depressedabout it,but you very rarely dieof anxiety or depression. Itmight be
better if you did but you very rarely do! And when you tell yourself, “I can’t
stand these bad events,” you really mean “I can’t be happy at all when they
occur” – as, of course, you can be and frequently are.
And then you often have another nutty thought: “Because I contributed to
this unfortunate situation” – and you may have contributed to it, you may
have polluted your environment, have acted unethically yourself, etc. – you
tell yourself, “Because I contributed to this badness, and am responsible for
part of it, I am a louse, I am all bad, I am not OK, I am a crumb for acting
crummily!” That’s pure magic. But you are never a human crumb, louse,
bastard, shit, or devil. Yes that’s what you really are calling yourself, a wicked
devil. All humans, including you, are just humans who at times act badly. And
they invariably act badly because they’re fallible, fucked up, and human!
That’s why they act badly! You don’t need a special reason, you don’t even
need a mother to act badly. You’re talented! You’re born with a propensity to
act stupidly, foolishly, asininely, badly, and your mother and father and the
movies just help you act crazily.
They don’t make you do it. You could refuse to, if you really worked at it. So
you falsely say, “I am a louse for causing this badness.” Then, when you
awfulize, you very frequently tell yourself another foolish statement: “Well,
since I’m not alone in this and Hitler and Nixon and others do bad things, and
since my mother-in-law and my mate are often nasty to me, they are lice for
causing be badness that I do not want. The world shouldn’t be that crummy!
And anybody who contributes to the crumminess” – which is the entire
human race, of course – “is a rotten stinker!” That’s what you devoutly believe
and you upset yourself.
You think that conditions upset you. But you really choose to do so
yourself. Now if what I say so far is true – and naturally it’s true but don’t take
it on faith, go look at the evidence. I am a scientist, an empiricist. What I state
is not true because I say it is, but because there’s much factual evidence and
logic supports it. You can review these facts and logic and ﬁgure it out for
yourself.
If you choose to be logical and empirical, you reverse this process. You look
at that crummy, irrational world which still indubitably exists and you ﬁrst
say to yourself, “Well, it’s bad, obnoxious, it’s deplorable, it’s a pain in the ass,
but it’s not all bad. Everything is not bad. Many things are but everything isn’t.
And when things are bad they’re only bad, they’re never more than bad. They
Rational Living in an Irrational World
259

can’t be more than bad! And if they are bad they should be bad because
anything that exists should exist while it exists. There are no musts, should,
oughts, necessities that it be non-existent. Whatever is is, and even though I
don’t like what is, it exists and it’s very nutty of me to say it must not exist.
Now I don’t like undesirable things existing it would be better if it didn’t exist.
Therefore, I may choose to work my butt off to change if for the better. Again,
if I don’t succeed I don’t. Tough shit! That’s the way it is if I can’t do anything
about it.”
And you next convince yourself that you can stand the world’s badness.
You’ll never like it but you can gracefully lump it. You can convince yourself of
this by realizing that you are not responsible for all the badness of the world.
You are responsible for some of it because as I said you sometimes steal
postage stamps, let’s face it! And you sometimes do other reprehensible,
unethical, and immoral acts. You are human and fallible, so you’d better
admit what you do badly. But you’re not responsible for some of them, you
are not a louse, you are not a worm, you are not a turd for acting turdily! And
by the same token other people are not bad people, they are people who do
bad (as well as good) acts.
To say the same thing slightly differently, the way you live with and stop
whining about reality even when it’s crummy, and the way you live happily as
you may notice I do – in this execrable world is by acceptance. Now
acceptance doesn’t mean endorsement or saying that things are good. It
means accepting bad reality and accepting that limited change is likely in the
world right now. Get rid of the current political graft and there will be other
corruption. Let’s face it, no matter which thugs run things; Democrats or
Republicans there will be other thugs. If we keep working, we may well get
lesser thugs. But the change that comes about at any one time is limited.
However, you can help effect some changes. They’re hard to make. You have
to work your ass off to make them and to stop the whining that distracts from
effecting change. But you can make some changes. And when your reality is
crummy, you can be selective about it, you don’t have to give in to everything.
If you live in a city like New York, for example, you can move. You don’t have
to put up with the pollution or the muggings. You can’t move completely, for
you don’t want to become a hermit. As I said before, that’s a little impractical.
But you do have choices and you can select your reality to some degree.
And you’d better accept that your personal happiness is possible in an
unhappy world. Now you won’t be as happy in an unhappy world as in
a better one. I don’t think there’s much doubt about that, but you can still
choose to be pretty damned happy even in a poor environment. That’s
possible; and ﬁghting irrationality and trying to be happy in a nutty world has
great advantages in itself. It’s challenging! It’s interesting. It’s rewarding. It’s
self-helping. Your very determination that you use to play this kind of game,
“How can I be happy in Sodom and Gomorrah?” rather than to play some
other game which we call Chess, Checkers, or Go, your very determination to
work at it can keep you reasonably happy. Not maximally happy. You’re not
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
260

going to be maximally happy unless we have Utopia and I doubt whether
we’re going to have Utopia!
You can be pretty happy in the world if you accept the fact that “A” an
obnoxious activating experience doesn’t directly cause “C,” your conse-
quence of misery, depression, upsetness, shame, humiliation, self-downing,
horror, or hostility. Accept the fact you largely create your despair at“B,” your
belief system. Then you can always go back to “B” and create a rational belief,
“How unfortunate! How sad, how deplorable, how unpleasant, how annoy-
ing, how unpleasing this activating event is!” And you can rationally refuse
to magically lapse over into the irrational belief, “I can’t stand it! It is awful!” –
whine, whine, whine! Or: “What I don’t want must not exist!” – whine, whine,
whine! Or: “If you don’t do what I want you to do your behavior is not only
shitty but you are a total shit!” – whine, whine, whine!
Ellis concludes this lecture that everyone can avoid torturing themselves
about the world’s irrationalities by doing the hard work of disputing their
irrational thinking – and by reading his books! He commends you to this task.

On a Philosophy of Life as Therapy
BERNARD:
Al, do you see REBT as being useful for people who may not have a
speciﬁc problem but who are maybe looking for a new way of
approaching and thinking about their life in order to be happier?
ELLIS:
Yes,that’saverygoodpoint,Michael.Werarelygetthatkindofclient
because clients who will come to and pay for psychotherapy are those
who are in fairly serious trouble. They either have a presenting
symptom of some kind or have many symptoms, or mainly have
symptoms of deep, long disturbance. But every once in a while
somebody comes who mainly wants to better his or her life. I have a
man I am seeing right now who has a PhD in counseling and has
practiced counseling and psychotherapy for several years and teaches
workshops and writes on the subject, and he is not really disturbed.
But he knows that he tends to do some self-defeating things that
he would like not to do. He would like to live his life better (1) in his
professional life, and then (2) in his social life, especially in his
relations with females. So although we’ve never found anything very
disturbedin hislife,IshowhimhowtohelphimselfwithREBTtolive
afuller and more productive, happier kind of existence. And in REBT
we do this regularly, not so much for clients as with our lectures, our
cassettes, our books, our talks, our workshops, and our computer
programs. In these ways, REBT is applied to “normal” people to help
them improve their existence rather than to overcome some serious
disturbance.
BERNARD:
In that sense REBT can be seen as being larger than just a set of
therapeutic techniques. Indeed, it seems to represent a philosophy of
life that all people might be able to proﬁt from, irrespective of their
having a speciﬁc problem they want a solution for.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
264

ELLIS:
Right. It could be summarized as a sort of secular, humanistic
philosophy of life which zeros in on people’s absolutistic thinking
and helps them to strive strongly, determinedly, and passionately
for their preferences and give up the commands, demands, and the
muststhattheyputonthemselvesandothersandtheuniverse,andto
thereby lead a fuller, happier existence. In that sense REBT can be
applied to anyone who is able to understand it. People of normal IQ

their growth and development.
BERNARD:
REBTseemstobeverymuchbothanoptimisticandhumanisticform
of therapy.
ELLIS:
Yes, it’s optimistic in the sense that it believes that you can change
yourself with hard work, which is one of the main ideas of REBT. Its
three main insights which almost anybody can use are (1) You largely
upset yourselfand, therefore, you can change your self; (2) No matter
how long you’ve done this or what your history is, with your parents
or with your culture, you are still upsetting yourself today if you are
now disturbed. (3) There is no other way, normally, than work and
practice, to change. So these ideas could presumably be applied to
practically every human much of the time.
On Religion
BERNARD:
OK. Moving away from therapy for a moment, I wonder if you could
comment on why you believe people ﬁnd religion so important in
their lives and whether you hold any religious views such as those
embodied in your book on humanistic psychotherapy.
ELLIS:
Well,Ihaveanew essayonacaseagainstwhatIcalldevoutreligiosity.
Religion has two main aspects. One, it is strong philosophy and it
usually includes some ethical viewpoint. And all humans, all groups,
have some kind of philosophy and some kind of ethical viewpoint or
else they probably wouldn’t survive, they would be chaotic. It is
almost necessary for them to be philosophic, to have a worldview, to
haveasystemofethics,humanisticorsupernatural.Ithinkthatethics
stem from living in groups and had better be humanistic. But some
religions claim that we derive ethics from God or from some
supernatural entity. But in one sense a philosophy of life, or a general
“religion” is the human condition.
But religiosity to me means a devout belief in the supernatural,
in faith unfounded in fact, in dogma, in absolutistic thinking. It
contends that there is one God or something like that, and that he or
shetellsusexactlywhatyoushoulddo,andifyoudothatyouwillhave
agoodlifeandifyoudon’tyouwillbedamnedandyoumaywellroast
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
265

in hell for eternity. That kind of devoutness is the problem and as I
show in this essay, “The Case Against Religiosity,” it isn’t only related
to theism and to God but to political devoutness, political religiosity,
and socio-economic religiosity. Fascists, Nazis, sometimes commu-
nists, and nationalists are tyrannically against freedom and devoutly
defend their beliefs. Ayn Rand was an atheist but I thought she was a
devout atheist – and therefore a religionist.
I think that this kind of religiosity is innate in humans because they
naturally, biologically tend to invent it and accept it. In all times and
climes they jump from “I would like this very much” to “Therefore I
need it!” And “Therefore there must be some God who will give it to
me or some devil who won’t!” And this I consider devout thinking,
religiosity. Not just religion, because many religions, like Judaism,
Protestantism, or even Catholicism, have liberal aspects or liberal
groups, which don’t think in that devout manner. But some of the
politicalgroupsaremoredevoutthansomeofthetheisticorreligious
groups. So I think there is a natural human tendency for humans to
think this way; and REBT ﬁghts that absolutism, ﬁghts dogma, ﬁghts
fascism, ﬁghts tyranny, ﬁghts all kinds of putting humans into one
categoryandinsistingthatthat’stheRightWay.Andsincepeoplewill
keep re-inventing dogma, REBT may have to be around practically
forever to try to get them to not necessarily be non-religious in the
conventionalsense,butnon-devoutlyreligious,non-devotedtowhat
I call religiosity or dogmatic religion.
BERNARD:
Which is the unquestioned belief.
ELLIS:
Which is the absolutistic belief that I know the Right Way and that
my group or my God or my political sect is absolutely correct. And
now today incidentally if people want it, because we have some
groups who believe that this life on earth is completely unimportant
and that our after-life is the only important thing. And the only way
you are going to merit heavenly after-life and to be deiﬁed, is by
killing dissenters in this life. These religionists may deliberately wipe
us all out with nuclear weapons.
On Spirituality
BERNARD:
Have you done any recent thinking in the area of spirituality?
ELLIS:
Spirituality has two different meanings. One of them is crazy and the
other is quite sane. The crazy one is that there are spirits, gnomes,
fairies, gods, and central forces in the universe – spiritual forces – and
if you get in touch with them and kiss their asses properly, then you
get great physical and mental results. And the facts tend to show that
supernatural spirits in all probability don’t exist. There may be such
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
266

a thing but there probably isn’t. No evidence whatsoever has ever
been forthcoming. Many investigators, many of them biased, are
supposedlyshowingthatpeoplewhoarereligiousandpraygetbetter.
That’s most questionable. If you pray for yourself, you might get
better because you think you’ll get better. So devout belief in the most
implausible kind of spirits might sometimes help – especially if you
are the kind of person who refuses to use more scientiﬁc forms of
therapy.
Others, like Victor Frankl, are encouraging people to be
“spiritual” by getting involved, spiritually, with purposes, with larger
goals in life, with humanistic causes, and with community spirit.
That kind of spiritualism is what I have always endorsed. It’s kind of
an existential position. You choose your goal, value, or purpose to
which you devote yourself. This is what I call a vitally absorbing
interest. If you pick it and push for it, you will often lead a better life
than if you ﬁnd it in some kind of spirits out there, who supposedly
give it to you.
BERNARD:
So you have no belief in any form of life beyond our current
existence?
ELLIS:
Well, that has two answers. There may be life on other planets. But as
farasweknow,wehumanslivefor90yearsthesedaysorso,and,then,
are totally non-existent. Now our atoms exist, and our goals and
purposes may go on after our death, so, in a sense, we have mortality.
But personal immortality, as far as we know, is illusory. It is invented
by people all over the world. Just about all cultures tend to have it.
Because many people won’t face the fact that because you’re here,
you’re here, you’re here for a limited time, and you’re going
eventually to be dead as a duck. They won’t face that, so they invent
all kinds of afterlives, in which you are sometimes a piece of soap,
and sometimes you’re a god or goddess. But they all tend to hold that
you do on after your physical death and to our knowledge, no single
person has ever come back.
One kind of natural spiritual approach may be very helpful, while
another kind of supernatural spiritual approach may help some
people but has its dangers. It has distinct disadvantages, the biggest
one probably being that you never really rely on yourself. You usually
hold, “I need some other supernatural force, god, or spirit to help
me.”And itimplies you can’t helpyourself,when really you are doing
so by believing in some kind of outside force. How ironic!
BERNARD:
Is supernatural spirituality all part of people’s search for meaning
in life?
ELLIS:
As the existentialists show, the search for meaning is an innate
tendency to try to live a good life. But then there is the tendency
to invent supernatural meaning. You see, you’ve got two tendencies.
Everyone had betterhave ameaningor purposebecause he or shewill
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
267

most likely live better with one. But the human condition is to invent
something beyond human meaning. Superhuman meaning. So most
people invent it. That’s why it is so rife, especially when other things
are bad – when we have wars, terrorism, famine, etc. Then people
probably invent it more.
On Politics
BERNARD:
I would be interested in learning of some of your more current
political views and learnings.
ELLIS:
Well, I haven’t been active very much politically in recent years
because I’ve been too busy. I used to be very active many years ago,
I was apolitical activist and a revolutionary who believed in socialism
with a small “s,” communism with a small “c,” and thought that the
capitalist system was a pretty crummy system and had better be
replaced for efﬁciency purposes. But then I got disillusioned, perhaps
because I read what was happening in the Soviet Union where they
were even more inefﬁcient. But I especially got disillusioned with the
dictatorship of the proletariat, which is really the dictatorship over
the proletariat, and the lack of freedom in the Soviet Union and in
other communist countries – in China, wherever communism was
used against the freedom of the people, and in social democratic
states which were not really very socialistic. Socialist democracies are
more democratic than socialistic, and the real communistic states
tend to become fascistic and authoritarian, and that hardly is good.
So I’m more and more in favor of freedom. Freedom has its own
disadvantages,becausethereisnoperfectsystem.ButI’dmuchrather
have a free capitalist society than a socialistic or communistic society
with its tyranny, its authoritarianism, its bigotry, and its intolerance.
The Soviet Union has frequently been on the side of absolutism,
Stalin in particular. But Mao, too, in communist China, and other
communist dictators have not been very democratic or probabilistic
or preferential. They have been absolutistic. They devoutly believe
in what they do.
Sothe onepoliticalcause, whichI speak infavorof today, isagainst
nuclearwarfare.I’mnotsurewhetheritisadvisablecompletelytoban
all nuclear ﬁssion. I think that under certain conditions and certain
limitations it had better not be banned, because it can be useful if
peoplearewillingtolivewithitsdangers.Buttousenuclearﬁssionfor
bombs and other weapons, I am quite opposed to. So I give talks and
I write papers against nuclear warfare. As I have written in a number
of journals, I think the danger is that ultimately some really rabid
fanatical group of religious or political zealots are going to blow us
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
268

all up with atomic bombs. So I think it is most important that
we consider that possibility and do something about it because
otherwise we won’t be around here to develop psychotherapy or
anything else.
Psychotherapists presumably favor human survival and happi-
ness;andanythinglikenuclearwarfarewouldcertainlybethegreatest
destroyer of that survival and happiness.
On the Mental Health of People in the
Twenty-ﬁrst Century
BERNARD:
Are people today saner than they were 30 years ago?
ELLIS:
Well,thefewwhouseREBT,yes!Asfortherestofthepopulation,I’m
not at all convinced that they’re saner. We know a lot more about
emotionaldisturbancebutthenwegetupsetaboutthat.Forexample,
because people know something about the Freudian system, they
say “I should have had a great childhood!” or “My lousy parents
shouldn’t have treated me the way they did!” So they can make
themselves upset about that. Or, because they know what standards
of mental health are, they can say, “I should live up to those
standards!” “I should not be disturbed!” “I must understand myself
thoroughly!” Consequently people can even get crazier because they
know something about mental health. However, I don’t see any
evidence, which shows that the knowledge of mental health that we
have these days, which is probably better than it was 50 or 100 years
ago, has helped humans to be saner. And that would tend to bolster
my assumption that people are mainly disturbed because of their
innate tendencies to be so and not because of their environment or
because of their knowledge.
So I think that people on the whole are pretty much as disturbed as
theyusedtobeandthatwestillhavethisenormousproblemoftaking
the whole human race and raising it, ﬁrst of all, to be less absolutistic
and less emotionally disturbed; and then, when that has been done
(which of course it hasn’t been), taking adolescents and adults and
teaching them some of the principles of mental health. Naturally, by
mywayofthinking,thismeansteachingthemtheprinciplesofREBT.
BERNARD:
Soyouwouldsaythatpeopletodayareasirrationalastheywerethirty

ELLIS:
Yes, we certainly have many manifestations of irrationality all over
the world such as, for example, terrorism and cultism. And we have
millions upon millions of people literally starving because of lack of
contraception and the population explosion. So we certainly still are
very, very nutty as humans.
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
269

On the Future of the Human Race
BERNARD:
Do you have some views about the future of the human race?
ELLIS:
I said back in 1962 that I didn’t think that there was a good likelihood
of our generals and politicians blowing us up, because the Soviet
generals know what the American generals know, and they know if
they push their atomic buttons the American generals will push our
nuclear buttons and all of us may go out of existence. So I think
they’re relatively sane and that they are unlikely to start a nuclear war.
But some fanatical, sectarian, religious group or possibly a rabid
political group, who are sure that they have the Right Way, may well
start a nuclear holocaust. Especially, ﬁfty or more years from now,
when they have enough technological know-how, some small group
offanaticswhopiouslybelievethatthey’redoingagooddeedandwill
go to an after-life where they will be deiﬁed and sit on God’s right
hand side because they have knocked off anti-religionists, may well
manufacture atomic bombs in their bathtubs. They may then delib-
erately push atomic buttons and literally blow up the whole earth.
Now I don’t think this is going to occur soon because these fanatical
groups are not that powerful and they can’t get a sufﬁcient number of
bombs right now todo much harm.But eventually technology will be
such that they will possess world-shattering bombs or other weapons
and they may well blow us up and that’s a very serious possibility.
Unless REBT and other sane therapies somehow get people to give up
absolutistic, devout, dogmatic bigotry, I don’t know how we are
really going to stop future world destruction by fanatically disturbed
groups.
On the Future of REBT
BERNARD:
I was going to ask you about the future of REBT. Perhaps you might
justbrieﬂycommenton whatyousee asthefuture.Youhavesaidthat
low frustration tolerance is one area where we all had better work
much harder in coming up with more effective techniques to help
people overcome LFT. Is that one area that you see as something that
people who are practicing REBT could be working harder on?
ELLIS:
Yes, I think the future of REBT has two main aspects. One is to give it
away more to the public, George Miller, a well-known, psychologist,
said “let us give psychology away to the public.” Right! REBT had
better not merely remain an effective psychotherapy but also be a
psycho-educational process for helping people in business, and
through ourmassmedia.Itcan betaught in the schools,in textbooks,
in regular books, audio and videocassettes, and through computer
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
270

education. So I think the psycho-educational aspects of REBT are
more likely to be important in the future than the psychotherapeutic
aspects. It had better encourage public education and public accep-
tance of its principles and practices.
Naturally, I think that REBT therapeutic theory is quite good, not
perfect, but it will be added to and subtracted from over the years
until it is better. But therapy applications, I think, are mainly going to
beeducational.REBTandotherformsofself-changehadbetteradapt
better convincing and teaching methods.
REBT is already a teaching kind of therapy. We teach people that
theyupsetthemselves.Weteach themhowtostopdoingso.Weteach
them how to apply the scientiﬁc method to themselves and others
and how to stubbornly refuse to upset themselves about virtually
anything. So I think that the future of REBT and other therapies will
include much better and researched methods of teaching.
This particularly goes for overcoming low frustration tolerance.
There presumably are better methods of showing people that if they
mainly go for immediate gratiﬁcation today they will frequently
sabotage themselves tomorrow and that instead, they can strive for
both the gratiﬁcations of today and tomorrow, have long-range
instead of short-range hedonism. This can be taught in many ways. It
can be shown by a therapist, especially a rational-emotive behavior
therapist. But there are many kinds of educational devices including
cartoons, ﬁlms, and other media that they use in education, to teach
children, adolescents and adults how to surrender their low frustra-
tion tolerance, how to admit it and recognize its disadvantages and,
then how to give it up. So I think the future of REBT may well be with
developing better psycho-educational techniques.
On Rational Beliefs and the Degree of Self-acceptance
BERNARD:
Focusing on the nature of rational beliefs, does the degree of
endorsement in a rational belief such as self-acceptance vary across
people? And if this is the case, is there an optimum level of self-
acceptance?
ELLIS:
Well, a low level of self-acceptance is the universal condition.
Practically nobody in the human race really accepts themselves
just because they decide to do it, which is sort of philosophical.
They all accept themselves conditionally. So, I would say that it’s
innate and just about everybody has it.
BERNARD:
So self-downing is innate. And you are making a case that it’s
extremely common. Even people relatively free from signiﬁcant
psychological problems still have tendencies to self-down.
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
271

ELLIS:
Yes, I think it’s very, very hard to come to our philosophic position.
Even Carl Rogers didn’t see you could not rate yourself at all.
BERNARD:
If self-downing is innate, does self-acceptance have to be learned?
ELLIS:
Well, I think it not only has to be learned, but taught and ﬁgured out,
because a lot of people do not agree with it when you teach it to them.
BERNARD:
Let’s say you’re teaching self-acceptance to someone who never
learned it, been taught it, and hasn’t ﬁgured it out. And let’s say
you teach them the idea and they understand and they accept it.
ELLIS:
Right.
BERNARD:
But let’s say they still have a long ways to go before they can actually
put it into practice.
ELLIS:
Right, I just had a client last night on the phone. And he’s a very
seriously disturbed OCDer. He gets self-acceptance after I spend
20 minutes showing him examples of his non-self-acceptance for
the tenth time and he’s ﬁne with that. But then a few minutes later he
slips back into self-rating saying “Because I have some good friends
and I’m kind to my mother, I’m OK.”
BERNARD:
Do some people have a little bit of self-acceptance and some people
have a lot of self-acceptance?
ELLIS:
Oh yes. Let’s put it this way. Let’s take self-downing. People with
severe personality disorders abysmally blame themselves. Now, all
people blame themselves, practically. Almost 100 percent do. But
some do it abysmally; they believe they are utterly worthless.
BERNARD:
But take self-acceptance. The ideal of self-acceptance, the idea of it.
Some people have a little bit of it or believe it lightly. When you have
taught it to them, they have a little bit of it.
ELLIS:
Yes, but they fall back.
BERNARD:
And then, over time, they have more of it and more of it.
ELLIS:
If they keep practicing, it’s almost routine, but it’s hard.
BERNARD:
But that process from going from a little bit of self-acceptance to a lot
of self-acceptance is a process of growth.
ELLIS:
Yes, they’re going to have to practice.
BERNARD:
But is that part of the educational process that should take place in
therapy and in schools for that matter?
ELLIS:
Well, yes,but you better watch it, because Ithinkthatit’s self-practice
more than anything else. You don’t have a teacher standing over you
saying “Keep doing it, keep disputing, there you go again.” You get
the ideal and then you realize that you fall back and, then, you force
yourself up again.
On the Need to Strengthen Rational Beliefs
BERNARD:
In encouraging the development of rational beliefs, is there a distinct
process of encouraging or deepening the strength of conviction in
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
272

beliefs over and above disputing irrational beliefs and then teaching
rationalbeliefsdidactically.Forexample,let’sconsiderstrengthening
the rational belief “In order for me to be successful in the long-term,
I sometimes will have to do unpleasant things in the short-term.
Things don’t always have to be easy.” It might take some time to
strengthen this rational belief after one has successfully disputed the
irrational need for comfort.
ELLIS:
Yes, there is a process to help deepen the strength of conviction in
rational beliefs. So, we do it didactically and we show them that it is
useful and they better to do it – and some bright people will do that
but others won’t. However, it’s faith founded on fact. You see, a great
deal of faith is unfounded. Because the fact is, rational thinking will
do them some good.
BERNARD:
In REBT, we have risk-taking activities to deepen the strength of
conviction in non-perfectionism and the need for achievement. We
assign risk-taking activities as homework as a way of disputing the
irrational need for achievement. Now, in my REE program for
schools, You Can Do It! Education, to strengthen the rational belief
“It’s okay to make mistakes when learning something new,” we get
kids to behave conﬁdently. We review with them conﬁdent behavior
that may involve making mistakes. They, then, go ahead and engage
in that behavior.
ELLIS:
They learn by trial and error.
BERNARD:
The method we use in You Can Do It! Education when teaching a
rational belief is not one that follows on after we dispute an irrational
belief. Rather, we discuss with students the meaning of the rational
belief and ask them to practice behavior that requires them to apply
the rational belief or can be assisted by the use of the rational belief.
For example, we get them to practice staying engaged in school work
that they ﬁnd very frustrating by using rational self-talk surrounding
high frustration tolerance “To be successful, I sometimes have to do
things I do not feel like doing.” Once they accomplish the task
successfully, they gain reinforcement for the utility of the rational
belief.
ELLIS:
And again, we use both rather than either/or – disputing and explicit
teaching of the rational belief.
BERNARD:
Would you agree that a good way of strengthening the conviction
with which rational beliefs are held and in deepening their internali-
zation is by giving people behavioral activities?
ELLIS:
Yes and that’s why it’s always cognitive, emotional and behavioral.
You’re giving them an idea but you’re getting them to think of it
emotionally, forcefully and act on it.
BERNARD:
So, if we want to strengthen a young person’s self-acceptance, we
could give them homework to be conﬁdent in putting up their hand
in class to answer difﬁcult questions where they will likely make
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
273

mistakes sothat thatthey canwork through the experience using self-
accepting self-talk.
ELLIS:
A shame attacking exercise.
BERNARD:
But, because it’s building the up rational belief rather than tackling it
from shame and reducing shame, we can teach it in the context of
learningnewconﬁdentbehaviorwiththepositivebeneﬁtsthataccrue
from being conﬁdent.
ELLIS:
Right.
BERNARD:
Forexample,weteachyoungpeoplethattherearetworationalbeliefs
that will help them to be successful; one is HFT, the other, internal
locus of control “The harder I work, the more successful I’m going to
be.” Next, we discuss with them things in their lives where they could
put these two rational beliefs into practice. We ask: “Where in your
life could you be doing better if you were more persistent” and here
are two ways to think that will help you.
ELLIS:
And at the same time, you are strengthening rational beliefs, you are
also automatically disputing some of the irrational beliefs.
BERNARD:
But, some people might say that for years you said that if you
effectively dispute irrational beliefs that people will readily endorse
rational alternatives and that disputing of irrational beliefs should be
sufﬁcient to help people live satisfying and productive lives. Are you
saying now we need to do more than just dispute irrational beliefs?
Do we also need to spend time on, as we eliminate the negative,
developing the positive?
ELLIS:
Let me say it hasn’t been empirically observed but that the chances
are that it is much better to do both. If you do either, it will work but
with limitations than if you do both, there will be some, but fewer
limitations. Because the human being is a complex animal and
unconsciously, if you do one, you are also doing the other.
Consciously and unconsciously, but not well enough so our theory
would say it’s admissible to do both.
BERNARD:
Would you say that many of your clients have grown up in homes
and have had early experiences where they have never really learned
a rational way of thinking?
ELLIS:
Well, no, partly because they’re in a culture like ours with all our
proverbs, you have a lot of rationality and they were told many times,
“A stitch in time saves nine.” and things like that with laughter,
mottos, in fact. In our culture and in probably every culture, they
have a lot of rational, positive thinking. And the positive thinking
thoughts ﬁgured out over the centuries, along with irrational
thoughts, are communicated widely. In school, everybody learns a
good many rational beliefs.
BERNARD:
I wonder if they really do. I don’t think rational beliefs are really
taught. I think young people hear about them occasionally.
ELLIS:
Well, that may be true.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
274

BERNARD:
Because if they were effectively taught, then your clients would be
more persistent, more conﬁdent in the way that they live their
lives.
ELLIS:
Well, I would say that they will irrationally resist them.
BERNARD:
Yes.
ELLIS:
So we don’t know, but you’re probably right.
BERNARD:
So the test of that might be if they went through a curriculum where
rational beliefs were effectively and regularly taught over the years,
young people attend school.
ELLIS:
Yes.
BERNARD:
To see if in fact then they were less resistant and were developing
better habits. Perhaps, constant exposure to rational beliefs leads to
a neutralizing of the negative impact of irrational beliefs.
ELLIS:
Yes. Well, don’t forget my concept of “willpower.” It says that
willpower consists of: First, making the decision and deciding to
change. Second, determining to change, which is a stronger thing.
Third, preferably, looking for information on how to change. And
fourth, acting, keep acting on it. Without that, “will” has no “power.”
And I said that in several books clearly.
BERNARD:
Right. Changing tack a bit, do you think that people lack conﬁdence
because they have never been effectively taught how to be conﬁdent?
Or do you think that they lack conﬁdence because they have high
anxiety?
ELLIS:
Well, again it’s both and not either/or. They lack conﬁdence because
they tend to be self-esteeming having no self-acceptance and,
therefore, when they try something and fail, they immediately
say, “I’m no good” or something like that so that knocks off their
conﬁdence.
BERNARD:
Would it also be the case that they weren’t effectively taught
that “It is okay to make mistakes when learning something new”?
And that “It doesn’t matter that much what people think about
you”?
ELLIS:
Yes, yes.
BERNARD:
So they would go hand in hand?
ELLIS:
Yes, now a few people ﬁgured that out for right or wrong reasons.
BERNARD:
The rational?
ELLIS:
Yes.
BERNARD:
Or, they could be taught it in schools which they’re not. And if they
were taught it, not to worry what people think about you and that it’s
okay to make mistakes and don’t evaluate yourself in terms of your
behavior that would help people be more conﬁdent.
ELLIS:
Yes. It might also have other better consequences such as increasing
high frustration tolerance.
BERNARD:
Right.
ELLIS:
It always gets more complicated than it seems at ﬁrst blush.
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
275

On Self-downing
BERNARD:
If you look at self-downing, what proportionate of it do you think is
biological and what proportion do you think is social, cultural?
ELLIS:
Well, I think a lot of it isbiological. Do you know my analogy of being
raised by wolves on a desert island? Suppose you were raised by a wolf
on a desert island. They took you in at the age of two months and they
raised you. You’re now, you think, a wolf. But you’re handicapped.
Because when the wolves destroy an animal to eat, you get it last. You
can’t run as fast as the other wolves. But there’s another wolf, like
you, who is also handicapped. He’s lame. So you both get to the
carcass last. So you both conclude in wolf language, “I’m handi-
capped, I’m inadequate in running, in getting to the carcass. Isn’t
that bad!” But you, the human, say to yourself, “Therefore, I’m a
shot.” Does the wolf ever really ever put himself down? I say no. He
doesn’t generalize and make himself into a rotten wolf, as the human
often makes himself into a rotten person. He feels very sad, upset in
that sense. But I don’t think he’d say, “I’m a rotten wolf.” But you, a
human, would.
So I say that humans, for evolutionary reasons, learn (a) to out
others down – “We’ll just kill the bastards before they kill us” – and
(b) to pout themselves down. And maybe that’s helped them to
change their behavior, because to some degree if you beat yourself,
youchangeyourbehavior.Ithinkhumansinnatelydownthemselves.
Then it gets exacerbated by others saying, “You’re a bad boy. You’re
a bad girl.”
On Self-Actualizing
BERNARD:
Whatareyourthoughtsontheself-actualizinginstinctasagenerative
force for getting people to experience joy in their life? Do you see it as
a strong force, that if you help people overcome their self-downing
and other rating and develop high frustration tolerance, that it is a
dynamic quality that will lead people to experience the things that
lead to an enjoyable life? Is it quiet or is it strong? Does it need to be
cultivated, encouraged? What are your thoughts on the self-actual-
izing person?
ELLIS:
Well, I have a few ideas along that line, and although I don’t like the
ideaofafullyfunctioningindividualandIhavewritten severalpapers
on a better functioning individual, because fully functioning implies
utopianism. So, I think that humans can be shown what to do, to
enjoy themselves more, but not absolutely or fully or anything
like that.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
276

BERNARD:
Right. When you think of the self-actualizing tendency, do you see it
as a motivational life force that propels people into new areas, or how
does self-actualizing operate psychologically?
ELLIS:
Well, again, our goal is to help people accept themselves whether or
not they do better, but to try to do better and live happier lives.
BERNARD:
And you think people’s tendency to try and do better is a clear
indication of the self-actualizing instinct?
ELLIS:
Yes, I think it’s a good example of their innate constructivism. I think
that humans can deﬁnitely do their best to enjoy themselves more
without being utopian and saying “I have to,” or “I’ve got to be
perfectly self-actualizing,” or anything along that line.
BERNARD:
And that’s a distinctly human quality, isn’t it? We presume animals
don’t have the self-actualizing instinct.
ELLIS:
I doubt it.
BERNARD:
They want to survive and that’s what propels them presumably.
ELLIS:
Well, I think we can help humans survive better, be happier, and to
not be desperate in their goals of functioning better.
On Homosexuality
BERNARD:
Have your views on homosexuality changed over the years?
ELLIS:
They have in some ways, and not in others. They haven’t in the sense
that my views were always misunderstood. I always said that both
heterosexuals and homosexuals who thought that they could not
under any condition have enjoyable sex with members of the other
sex (if they were homosexual) or with the same sex (if they were
heterosexual) were compulsive and rigid and were ignoring the fact
that humans are basically bisexual and that they are quite capable of
enjoying both kinds of sexuality, homosexuality and heterosexuality,
bisexuality,ifyouwanttocallitthat.Istillthinkthatanyheterosexual
who under no condition could even think about or allow himself or
herselftohavehomosexualthoughtsorrelationshipsisdisturbedand
any homosexual who is equally rigid also has emotional problems.
Now in the old days there were probably more rigid homosexuals
than heterosexuals because many heterosexuals have always had
some homosexual relations while the homosexuals were more rigidly
stuck to one thing. Today, I don’t know if that is true. The homo-
sexuals have come out of the closet and they get along much better in
society. They are less persecuted, though they are still persecuted,
and, therefore, I think that they tend to have more preferential than
compulsive sex than they used to have.
Thethingthatishealthy aboutsexisthatyoucan entertain theidea
that you can enjoy it in more than one way, not just in one rigid
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
277

homosexual or heterosexual way, just in masturbation, just with
animals, or just in one other monolithic way. And I think the
homosexuals are much less rigid than they used to be. Also in the
old days gay people had an additional disturbance and that was that
they were being severely persecuted by society and they still were
foolishly sticking to their homosexuality when they could have made
greater efforts to become bisexual. Today they aren’t that persecuted,
so they have little trouble remaining homosexual in the big cities of
the world.
They aren’t pressed to become bisexual or pluri-sexual. So I think
they are less disturbed and I think that the whole business of calling
people deviants, as I’ve written in one of my fairly recent books,
Sex and the Sexually Liberated Man, is mistaken. It’s almost
impossible to deﬁne a truly deviant or an abnormal act, much
less a deviant person. And it’s not what you do homosexually or
heterosexually which is deviant, it’s the rigid way, the manner, in
which you do it. So if you do it in an absolutistic, compulsive,
obsessive manner, then whatever the sex is it could be called
abnormal or disturbed or we could better say unhealthy. But if
you do it in an open and non-compulsive manner, then even some
bizarre forms of sex may be called healthy. Now I’ve basically said
these things many years ago but I probably think more so along
these lines today.
BERNARD:
That would allow for gay people who would prefer to have sex with
the same sex even though they would entertain the possibility of
having it with the opposite sex that you could consider those people
to be fairly well adjusted and fairly rational in their outlook.
ELLIS:
Oh,yes.Anygaypersonwhoreallyexperimentsseveraltimes,atleast,
with heterosexuality and ﬁnds it dislikeable, un-preferable and,
therefore, practically all the time he or she sticks to gay sex acts,
wouldbehealthyor“normal.”It’swhenpeopledon’ttryalternate sex
modes at all or are utterly bigotedly convinced that they couldn’t
under any circumstances, enjoy them that they make themselves
compulsive and hence disturbed. The homophobics, that is hetero-
sexuals who are horriﬁed at the thought of homosexuality and would
never try it and would put themselves down if they did, they’re
distinctly disturbed not because they like heterosexuality, but be-
cause they won’t consider any other possibility and because they are
rigidly bigoted against homosexuals.
BERNARD:
So the rationality that characterizes homosexual preferences forhomo-
sexuals is similar to the heterosexual preference for heterosexuality.
ELLIS:
Yes, I said this originally in The American Sexual Tragedy back in
1954, before I even founded RET, and people felt horriﬁed, because
I said that any heterosexuals who under all conditions, when he was
conﬁned on a desert island only with males for 20 years, wouldn’t
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
278

consider and to some degree be able to have enjoyable homosexual
relations, would obviously be compulsive and rigid and therefore be
somewhat disturbed.
On Marriage
BERNARD:
Turning to another potentially volatile arena, I’m wondering if you
could comment on the institution of marriage and I’m wondering if
you feel that it will survive in the near future.
ELLIS:
Well, I endorse Westermark’s deﬁnition of marriage, which is not
necessarily legal marriage. For he deﬁnes marriage as a partnership
between a man and woman who live together and who usually have
children. They live together and share domesticity – not only
intimate sex and love relationships, but other socio-economic
relationships. And that seems to have been the norm throughout
human history.
There are some marriages which are not like that where they live
apart or where they have polygamy, polyandry, or one of the other
forms of group marriage; and there are social systems, such as the
ancient Chinese system, where the grand patriarch ran things and
the individual couple was relatively important. But I think that
marriage in the somewhat conventional sense, where a man and a
woman live together and share responsibilities as well as like each
other and respect each other, and where they usually rear children,
has been the norm and has some biological advantages and that is
why it remains so. It has child-rearing advantages, it has emotional
advantages, it has economic advantages, and therefore I don’t see it
dying out.
I think that for a minority of people monogamous marriage will be
modiﬁed and has often been modiﬁed. For example, a minority of
people can have polygamous relationships and two people who live
together can have open marriage where they allow each other to have
sex and love relationships outside the marital relationship with their
full knowledge and consent. Some people are able to do this. Not so
many so far, because they would have to be very rational and use
REBT in order to do it! Plural marriage is possible, but difﬁcult. For
the majority of people at the present time, liking what they like and
disliking what they dislike, I think that the usual kind of marriage
with a nuclear family is what most people like and therefore it’s not
dying out. It’s often modiﬁed in certain ways, but I don’t see
conventional marriage disappearing. If anything, it is being bolstered
because people can be more realistic and can use REBT to do away
with the hostilities frequently disrupting a marriage. With REBT,

279

they can also reduce their low frustration tolerance about the
restrictions of marriage.
So, if anything, marriage can now be better. I don’t see it dying out,
even though at times it is signiﬁcantly modiﬁed.
On Sex
BERNARD:
As an expert in the area of sexual counseling I wonder if you might be
able to make any observations of changes in people’s sexual pre-
occupations and problems over the past thirty years.
ELLIS:
Well, sex itself has become more preferred rather than obligatory.
More people in Western civilization are having sex before marriage,
women in particular. In the old days the men had it with prostitutes.
Today, both sexes are enjoying it more and doing more sex acts in
relationships – having a wider range of sexuality. So I think that sex is
now better than it was 50 or 100 years ago for many people much of the
time. Sex problems, like nonsexual emotional problems mainly stem
from musts. Freud thought that sex problems lead to general emotional
problems, while Karen Horney, Erich Fromm and other therapists
thought the reverse, that sex problems stem from general problems. I
tend to agree with the latter view. I think that people’s sex problems are
usually a function of their musts, their absolutistic thinking: “I must have
great sex all the time and isn’t it awful if I don’t!” And they bring on
anxiety: “My partner must love me, adore me, and satisfy me in any way I
want! And isn’t it horrible when he or she doesn’t!” So what we call
sexual disturbances are usually the result of absolutistic thinking and of
general disturbance; and I think that REBT can particularly help
overcome them.
For a while people get preoccupied with one thing or another and
therefore may go from sexual liberalism to sexual puritanism. Even
sexual liberals can get hung up on sex and get upset about it. That’s
people’s nature to go from one extreme to another. But I don’t know
that their sex problems are much different today than they used to be.
They always believed, and still do, “I must do well!” “You must
please me enormously!” and “Sex itself must be easy with no great
hassles!”
Most sex problems ﬂow from these musturbatory ideas. So even
though we have liberalized sex and gotten rid of some old time
standard musts, such as, “You must not have pre-marital sex!” We
still have the personal musts that people bring to sex, to love, and to
marriage; and we had therefore better keep working with REBT
to minimize these dogmatic commands on our partners and
ourselves.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
280

BERNARD:
It would seem that the higher proportion of divorces today might be
brought about by sexual problems more so than perhaps 20 or 25
years ago.
ELLIS:
Well, don’t forget that in the old days couples lived with sexual
deprivation, the women certainly did, and the men often thought,
“Well, my wife is no goddamned good in bed. She may be screwing
me and having children but she is no goddam good in bed, but I have
to stay with her.” So now they realize that they don’t have to stay,
that they’re not being socially despised for getting a divorce. And as
long as they can make reasonable economic agreements, and they can
often arrange that better today because the wife works as well as the
husband, divorce becomes more feasible. Consequently, when they
do have poor sex they more easily get a divorce. But don’t forget
when they have poor communication, poor social relations, or child
raising disagreements, they also more easily get a divorce today. So
the divorce rate soars not only because of sex problems.
On the Use of REBT in Diverse Cultures
BERNARD:
You’ve done a signiﬁcant amount of travelling to other countries in
the past few years. Given that REBT was born and bred in New York
how applicable have you found its basic principles to be in other
countries?
ELLIS:
Well, I would say that REBT goes over great with the majority of
educated people in these other countries. RET is applicable to
educated people, reasonably educated and bright people, all over
the world and therefore I ﬁnd that it does very well abroad. I recently
wasinKuwaitanddidathree-dayworkshoponstressfortheInstitute
for Banking Studies there. The participants were educated bankers,
and they easily took to the REBT even though most of them were
Muslims, and were certainly not raised in American culture. The
same thing goes when I go to Australia, or Germany, or to Bombay,
where I gave another three-day workshop a few years ago. The
Bombay people I talked to were certainly relatively educated and
bright and interested in REBT. So for people like that I think there’s
a sort of universal acceptance, no matter where I am in the United
States or in other countries.
On the Use of REBT with Men and Women
BERNARD:
From your own clinical experience I wonder if you could comment
on whether REBT is equally effective with men as with women.
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
281

ELLIS:
With our male and female clients at the Institute here in New York
and for those I have seen in workshops all over the country and all
over the world, I would say it seems to be equally applicable. I think
that women in the United States and in other parts of the world do
seem to be more motivated interpersonally to use REBT and men in
the past were more motivated to use it to become more efﬁcient
and less disturbed with their work. Now, in the United States at
least, the women who come to therapy frequently are just as
motivated to use REBT for work and professional reasons and
reasons as for interpersonal relations. But women do seem to
usually be more interested in effective relations with other humans
than men are and that may possibly be partly their biological
tendency. But it is also sociological and related to their social roles
and scripts.
BERNARD:
Are they equally receptive to the basic ideas?
ELLIS:
Yes, women and men both are receptive to the ideas that REBT can
help them and their partners be less hostile and more communicable
and can aid their achievement. Sometimes women distort REBT
and think, without knowing much about it, that it tries to get people
to be unemotional, that’s not so. REBT helps people, if it works, to be
appropriately emotional and often more involved, more passionate,
more able to relate to each other and it does away or tries to minimize
inappropriate feelings like despair and depression, rage, and self-
hating. And when women understand that that’s what it is and that
it’s not an anti-emotional form of therapy, then they are quite
receptive to it.
BERNARD:
So you would say basically you haven’t found signiﬁcant differences
between males and females in their understanding and acceptance
of REBT as well as the effectiveness of REBT in solving their
problems.
ELLIS:
Well, one difference in the United States is that women tend to
acknowledge that they are upset and are motivated to get help so will
frequently come to therapy more than men will. Men are still often
preoccupied with business and probably more defensive than
women.
Therefore, a wife will want to come to REBT marriage and family
counseling more than the husband will frequently want to come. Or
she will want to come to work out her own problems more than the
husband will, especially if he is successful in business. Being an
achiever, he may think that he’s healthy in all other aspects of life,
when he really isn’t. So I think that women, being on the whole less
defensive than men and therefore are more interested in helping
themselves emotionally, are often even more likely to beneﬁt from
REBT than are many males.

On Dispelling Myths about REBT
BERNARD:
Over the years there have been a number of misunderstandings
about REBT that have been perpetuated, such as REBT is only useful
for highly intelligent and verbal clients; that it ignores and tries to do
away with emotions; that it is too simple an approach for under-
standing and resolving psychological problems. Are there any con-
temporary myths about REBT that you would like to dispel?
ELLIS:
Well,there are probably many myths people promulgate, suchasthat
REBT only works with certain kinds of therapist personalities. The
therapist, supposedly, has to be like me. Actually there are REBTers
who are mild and didactic and don’t take my strong-hearted ap-
proach and don’t use my language. One of the myths is that REBT
requires people to use the kind of “so-called” obscene and other
language that I use, so that’s a myth. One myth that was promulgated
by some other cognitive behavior therapists is that REBT originally
was just cognitive and then it later added behavioral methods. No,
REBT may not have emphasized behavior techniques as much as it
does now because I deliberately at ﬁrst stressed its cognitive, philo-
sophic aspects. REBT is actually one of the original major multi-
modal therapies. It always uses cognitive, emotive, and behavioral
methods.
Also, of course, some people contend wrongly that REBT is always
argumentative and doesn’t really collaborate with the client and see
the client’s point of view, but talk the client into ideas and values,
which they may not have. They forget that RET, ﬁrst of all, teaches
clients new ways of thinking and that it can be done in a highly
didactic yet non-argumentative manner. When difﬁcult clients
(DCs) resist and when they have trouble seeing how they upset
themselves, then REBTers may argue vigorously with them and show
themhowtheyaremaintainingself-defeatingbeliefs.Oneofthemain
ways to help really resistant, bright clients is to show them strongly
and philosophically, that they are wrongly rating themselves and/
or others.
So we often do that, but that isn’t necessarily the essence of REBT.
We frequently dispute irrational beliefs more actively, more vigor-
ously, more of the time than other therapies. But REBT isn’t only
argumentative and it collaborates in most ways with clients and tries
to see things from their viewpoint instead of dreaming up a procrus-
tean bed to put them in – which I think some of the other therapies,
such as the Freudian therapies particularly do.
So there are these myths about REBT and some of them will
probably continue to exist. One recent myth has been that REBT
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
283

cannot be used with religious clients because I personally am an
atheist and I am against absolutistic and dogmatic religion. But
actually REBT is used by ministers, priests and rabbis; and they may
not use it exactly the way that I would use it, with my personal
emphasis against absolutism.
BERNARD:
Related to your discussion on your style of therapy and some
misconceptions that other people may have of it, many people’s
only exposure to your style and conduct of therapy has been through
the Gloria ﬁlm. I wonder if you can indicate any similarities and
differences in your therapeutic style since you made Gloria.
ELLIS:
WhatI didinGlorianeverwasmy therapeuticstyle.Thatwasamovie
literally done under lights and we had a very limited time, and I tried
to get too much into that limited time and that was a mistake. Gloria
was also supposed to bring up the same problems she did with the
others. But she didn’t do so, and we got sidetracked into discussing
methods of dating. So that we only partly did REBT and not in my
usualstyle.Mystylenormally ismuchmorerelaxedasshowninother
ﬁlms that I have made. The American Association for the Counseling
and Development has several ﬁlms of mine; and we have done
videotapes and tape recordings, which show what my style is. So
the way I talked to Gloria never was my typical or usual style. Also in
the Gloria ﬁlm I deliberately stuck mainly to RET cognitive methods
and I didn’t use many of our emotive and behavioral techniques,
which we usually employ in RET. So, again, the way RET is normally
done by me and by others is quite different in many respects than my
style in the Gloria ﬁlm.
On the Professional Acceptance of REBT
BERNARD:
Do you think people today accept REBT more readily than they did
in the early 1960s?
ELLIS:
Oh, I would say there is no question about that. For several reasons,
which are the most important. First, Aaron Beck came along in the
early1960sandstarted hisformof cognitive therapy,whichIthinkhe
partly independently discovered. He was a psychoanalyst, as I was,
and he left the fold and started cognitive therapy and introduced it to
psychiatrists. Then a good many psychologists started doing REBT
and his form of cognitive therapy.
As early as 1964 empirical studies of REBT started to be done,
because my hypotheses were stated in such a clear manner that they
could be empirically tested. So many studies of REBT were started.
REBT and closely related CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy) now
have well over two hundred outcome studies, which support
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
284

rational-emotive theories and practices. These outcome studies were
quoted widely in the professional literature so that RET became
popular.
My original twelve irrational ideas were put into many tests of
irrationality and they’ve been used with many different clinical and
non-clinical populations. More than 250 studies of these irrational
beliefs tests have appeared in literature and almost all these studies
have supported them as prognosticators or indicators of emotional
disturbance. Again, almost all the outcome studies of REBT and CBT
have shown that, when used with a control group, these therapies
produce better results, other therapies, or waiting list procedures.
So today RET, under various names (such as cognitive therapy,
cognitive behavior therapy, cognitive restructuring, rational behav-
ior therapy, and multi-modal therapy), is probably the most popular
form of therapy used by practicing therapists. Either they uncon-
sciously are using it or they are consciously doing so and sometimes
giving credit and sometimes not. REBT and CBT also have spread to
otherpartsoftheworldaregrowinginpopularityalmosteverywhere.
And, spread by books, cassettes, and other mass media, it has become
unusually popular.
On His Work Ethic
BERNARD:
You have celebrated another birthday and yet you continue to work
12–16 hours a day or more, seven days a week. What motivates you to
work so hard?
ELLIS:
Well, I believe – and this is just a hypothesis – that I follow the lines
that Anne Rowe, a well-known psychologist, discovered years ago.
She studied 25 psychologists, outstanding ones, and 25 outstanding
scientists from biological and chemical ﬁelds. She had them all
picked by other authorities, so that she wasn’t prejudiced in the
survey she did. They were 25 outstanding people in each of three
ﬁelds and she gave them long interviews, and several projective and
non-projective. She spent hours with each of them, saw them in their
own habitat, to discover why these ﬁve scientists were better, more
renowned than other people in their ﬁelds who also had PhDs and
who were just as bright and experienced. She ﬁnally concluded that
the one main reason why they were outstanding was they liked to do
what they were doing better than they liked anything else in life. They
really enjoyed psychology or biochemistry more than, say, sports,
novels, or TV.
So I think that I like to do most of the “work” I do more than I like
other things. I like talking to people and arguing them out of their
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
285

bullshit. If I go to a cocktail party. for example, and I meet a new
person and it so happens he or she ﬁnds out I’m a psychologist and
brings up a problem, I enjoy talking about it – for free! Some
psychologists do the opposite. In their social life they avoid all
psychologizing but I don’t. I really like to do psychotherapy. The
reason, I think, I like it is because I passionately abhor human
inefﬁciency – especially cognitive and behavioral inefﬁciency. So I
enjoy thinking about, theorizing about, working at, and eliminating
inefﬁciency.
I’m really an efﬁciency expert in many respects. I always was since
before I was a psychologist. I loved efﬁciency in business and in other
aspects of life. I truly like devising new efﬁcient techniques.
On the other hand, I do not particularly care for a lot of the things
that other people do. I really hate lying on a beach and being in the
sun all day – that would be a bore! I could read there, but I could
read more comfortably in bed, so why should I go to a goddamned
beach and lie on uncomfortable hot sand? So I like doing things
which other people also like. I like to play ping-pong, I like to have
sex, and I like other activities. But most people don’t like most
talking, theorizing, and inventing as much as I do. I ﬁnd it more
enjoyable doing my various forms of psychological and research
activities than I ﬁnd other things. In fact I get bored very easily with
chitchat, TV, and watching sports, but I don’t get bored with
my work.
I can havea dinner party with my own guests in my own home. But
after an hour or two the conversation usually comes around to the
same channels it went around in two years ago.
It’s not that I dislike New York City – it’s the best city in the world
for cultural events. But I don’t go to many of them because I would
rather do psychology-related activities than see those cultural
events. When I see them I enjoy them – particularly listening to
music. I enjoy all kinds of cultural events, I enjoy active involvement
more.
Also, my work in REBT has many aspects to it, I do therapy, I do
group therapy, I talk, I give workshops, I write, I read, I travel. So, it’s
not that I am always doing one thing. I might work 13 or 14 hours in
one day, mainly seeing clients but I’m usually doing other things as
well. I administer the Institute. I like administration a little – not as
much as other activities. I wouldn’t want to mainly administer any
organization, but I do enjoy planning, scheming, and strategizing to
some extent.
So I think it’s mainly because I enjoy my work more than I thrill to
other things that I spend so much time at it. Then of course, I have
a goal, a purpose. I’m working at various aspects of REBT because
Iwant tohelppeople,Iwanttodevelopmytheory,andI wanttopush
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
286

efﬁciency in human life. So I have a big, vital interest. And when you
have an interest – even the shit you have to do to abet it doesn’t bore
you that much. Because almost everything I do is done for my major
goals and purposes. When I do the bibliographies for my books for
example, I ﬁnd them a pain in the ass. But I quickly and un-
rebelliously do them, to ﬁnish the blasted book!
On His Morning Mindset
BERNARD:
So how is Albert Ellis generally feeling today? When you wake up in
the morning, are you typically up or down or neutral?
ELLIS:
Well, when I wake up for the ﬁrst few minutes I don’t practically feel
like rising and shining, nor feel deliriously happy. I feel a little tired
and a little groggy from the tiredness. But I never delay. I never use
that as an excuse not to get up. Because, I could say, “well, ﬁve
minutes more or ten minutes more,” which I used to do years ago,
when my alarm clock woke me up. But then I might take ﬁfteen
minutes more sleep and be late for whatever I had ﬁrst scheduled.
So I get up right away and within ﬁve minutes or so I’m okay and
feeling ﬁne. I feel a little tiredness from sleeping and then I get over
it right away. But I don’t wake up depressed and I’m rarely elated.
Certain mornings I’m more concerned about logistics of what I
have to do. But I’m in quite good shape after ﬁve minutes of getting
rid of my tiredness just by washing my face and dressing. So, by the
time I get down here, which is only ten minutes after I get up, I am
ready to go.
On Dealing with Physical Ailments
BERNARD:
And the mindset you have towards your own ailments?
ELLIS:
Well, they are a pain in the ass. But if I don’t do the things that make
the time and energy to control them, I’ll lose more time and energy,
die earlier, or get more dismal results. So I just accept that attending
tothem haddamnwellbetterbedone.AndIrarely avoid doingthem.
I regularly take care of my body.
On Satisfying Moments Over the Years
BERNARD:
What are the most satisfying moments you and REBT have had over
the years?
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
287

ELLIS:
In 1957, a highlight was the publication of my ﬁrst book on REBT,
How to Live with a Neurotic, which was for the public and was my
ﬁrst signiﬁcant book on REBT. Then, in 1961, two books, A Guide
to Rational Living and A Guide to Successful Marriage with the
collaboration of Robert Harper who was my very good friend and
the ﬁrst other therapist to use REBT. Then in 1962, of course, Reason
and Emotion in Psychotherapy was published. Around 1963, I started
to emphasize written homework more – not just activity homework
but written homework. I didn’t have a speciﬁc form, but just told
them to do their ABCs of REBT. In 1968, spurred by Chuck Stark and
MaxieMaultsby,Ipublishedourﬁrstprintedhomeworkform,which
we keep revising over the years.
Also in the 1960s, cognitive psychology began to make great
advances. I had known a little about it but I had never conceived
psychology as being that cognitive. But independently of my work,
many different people in social psychology and experimental psy-
chology started becoming cognitive. This was great, because they
were going along RET lines and hadn’t been inﬂuenced by me.
In 1963, again, Tim Beck wrote a ﬁne paper on thinking and
depression. I got in touch with him and found a kindred soul who, as
farasIcouldtell,hadindependentlyﬁguredoutmanyoftheelements
of REBT. Then I started getting professional recognition, and I
received the American Humanist of the Year Award in 1971, the
distinguished practitioner award of the APA’s division of psycho-
therapy in 1973, and the distinguished award of the American
Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists in 1975.
I had been a pioneer sextherapist and marriage counselor, sexologist,
for many years and the ﬁrst president of the Society for the Scientiﬁc
Study of Sex and recipient in 1971 of its award for distinguished
contributions to research in sex.
On His Recent Pleasurable Moments
BERNARD:
What are some of the pleasant moments you’ve experienced recently;
the things you take satisfaction from and you’ve said “I’ve enjoyed
that”?
ELLIS:
Well, I’mstill devoted toalarge degree tomusic,and Ilistento quite a
bit of it, especially on Sunday or Saturday night when I’m reading or
writing. The recordings today are better than they ever were. I can’t
hear them as well with my poor hearing, but they’re better. And a lot
more material isnow recorded. So,Iget to hear new things,and that’s
a great pleasure and it always has been.
Then, reading is most enjoyable. Science keeps learning, learning,
learning new things all the time. I read lots of journals and some
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
288

amount of books. And I enjoy it and wish I had more time for it
than I do.
I keep travelling and go to new places, like Taiwan, and it’s a
different kind of culture. It has its disadvantages, but it has advan-
tages and differences. I still like going around to different places,
talking to people, meeting new people. I don’t like actual travelling.
ButI always havethingsto do on the plane,or waiting for it, soI don’t
waste time. That’s good.
And I sort of like getting awards. I got the high award from the
American Psychopathological Award despite the fact that years ago,
they refused to make me a member of that Association, because I
wasn’t directly into psychopathology.
I don’t have that many close friends, because I haven’t had time for
them. But I certainly have people with whom I interact. I never have
time for all my enjoyments. So, I’m always restricted, by being very
busy – which I deﬁnitely enjoy. I get a great deal of pleasure in almost
everything I do, including working with my clients, where I spend so
much time. I still ﬁnd therapy interesting. I’m a problem-solver and
I like solving people’s problems.
So I lead not an ecstatic life, but an interesting one. And I’m very
rarely bored. Because when I’m bored, such as at cocktail parties
where there’s trivial chitchat, I stay away, leave fast, or stay and seek
out an interesting conversation. So I can get bored, but I manage my
life so that very little of it is boring.
On His Regrets
BERNARD:
Is there anything that you would like to do now that you haven’t been
asked to door haven’t had time to do,like parachuting out of a plane?
ELLIS:
IwouldstillliketoifIhadthetime,evenwithoutthemusicaltraining,
to write an opera, both the words and the music, Also, I would like to
form a society for neglected music. There is considerable neglected
music–classicalandsemi-classical–whichhasbeenlostintheshufﬂe
because it is not pushed.
If He Had to Do It All Over Again?
BERNARD:
If you were going to do it again, would you choose to be a
psychotherapist, a psychologist, or would you pick a different area?
ELLIS:
I would probably pick a different area, because the practice of
psychotherapy today is deﬁnitely restrictive, because of the
HMOs. And you have to keep making out reports, so there’s a lot
Albert Ellis Interviewed by Michael E. Bernard
289

of clerical work, which in the old days was much less. So that’s a pain
in the ass. And many psychologists have to keep scrounging for
clients, and will have to do other kinds of work. Therefore, if I really
had to start all over again, I would probably push myself into the
ﬁeld of music and really study it and compose all kinds of operas,
symphonies, musical comedies, etc.
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
290

A Rational
Approach to
Happiness
Michael E. Bernard PhD
What makes someone happy? Is it
good health? Is it having material
prosperity’ Is it sitting in an outdoor
cafe drinking coffee and watching
the sea of humanity walk by? Is it
listening to a Mozart sonata?
When I listen to people talk about
what makes them happy I am some-
what surprised. I recently talked to a
friend of mine who, despite having
made millions of dollars as a result of
being one of the earliest importers of
computers, still complained of being
unhappy a lot of the time. This is in
spite of having a healthy and loving
family.
Money may make it easier for you
to acquire the things that can help
make your life more enjoyable, but it
is certainly not the answer to the
question of what are the essential
ingredients to happiness.
While happiness is not the same
thing as the absence of emotional
misery, there is no doubt that if you
want to become happier it is a good
idea to do something about your
emotional bad habits. Eva, who is
angry and guilty about not being
able to live up to her mother’s nev-
er-ending demands, had better learn
to feel calmer and accept her mother
if she wants to begin to live a happier
life. Bill’s anxiety about rejection
prevents him from ﬁnding a love
relationship that will bring him hap-
piness and he, too, could do some-
thing
about
his
bad
emotional
habits. Stan’s anger at others’ behav-
ior at work prevents him from gain-
ing the support and getting the
promotion that would enable him
to be more successful and happy. In
Stan’s case, anger is interfering with
happiness and if he can learn to
control his anger he will be in a
better position to make himself
happier.
Fortunately, there is plenty of
good advice around that can help
us be less miserable and overcome
our emotional problems. There is an
abundance of self-help books and
psychological advice for helping us
become less stressed and to solve our
emotional problems. I do not believe
these books are enough, however, to
help us live happier lives. My own
experience in the ﬁeld of psychology
suggests there is very little guidance
around for helping people ﬁnd
happiness.

Some people think loo much
about not being happy and literally
tyrannize themselves into having
emotional problems about not being
happy. They think “I must be happy.
I need to be happy. I should be
happy!” And when they observe
themselves going through a period
in their liveswhen they arenot wildly
happy, they agonize and exaggerate
their emotional slate well beyond the
realms of rationality. Other people
may not spend enough time thinking
about whether they are happy and
what they can do to become happier.
Caught up in the day-to-day rou-
tines of life, they accept a low degree
of satisfaction because they do not
consider the possibility of anything
better for themselves.
The following approach, which I
have used both with myself and
others, can help guide you toward
becoming happier in life: happier
with yourself, with your relationships
withothers,andmorefulﬁlledinyour
work activities. The approach I’m
going to describe can be considered
a “rational” approach to personal
happiness. Why “rational?” Largely
because, as you’ll see shortly, it is
based on your making choices about
your actions that will bring you
happiness. These choices are based
on your objectively looking at the
short-term and long-term conse-
quences of your emotional and be-
havioral reactions to your world and
changing those actions you ﬁnd
unhelpful. This view accords a major
amount of responsibility to you for
making
yourself
happy,
without
blaming your upbringing or others
formakingyouunhappy.Further,the
approach places a great deal of faith
in the power of your mind to direct
youtowardacourseofactionthatwill
bring with it maximum happiness
This approach to happiness has its
origins in the writings of many phi-
losophers such as Epictetus, Marcus
Aurelius,
Baruch

Ellis.
Let me deﬁne happiness as a rela-
tive state of emotional well-being
which arises when you achieve goals
you set for yourself – which usually
include success and achievement
along with love and afﬁliation.
Said another way, you tend to be
happy when your perceived needs for
success and love are met.
As individuals, we vary as to those
areas and activities in our lives where
success and love are important:
home, work, friendship, and love
relationships, artistic/creative pur-
suits, sexual activities, and sporting
involvements. In addition, over our
life span, those things we choose to
be successful at may change, as does
the focus of our needs for love and
approval.
Happiness can also be seen as a
consequence of the unfolding and
development of your unique poten-
tial. It often accompanies your
growth process even if in the short-
run
you
are
feeling
miserable.
For example, a mother’s strain in
providing for the needs of a very
young child or more than one child
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
292

is stressful and yet, at the same time,
it can be very fulﬁlling. Similarly,
going through the agonies of a rela-
tionship breakdown to achieve per-
sonal independence also represents
happiness gained through the pain
of the unfolding of your potential.
Even
though
happiness
is
a
commonly accepted goal of human
beings,theuniverseprovidesnoguar-
antees for any of us that we will
be happy. This is because there is
no one who decides that because
you are living such a noble or difﬁcult
life you “deserve” to be happy.
There is no one “right” method
to become happier in your life.
There are many different ways.
Some people give themselves to
God and are. indeed, happier than
they have ever been. Some people
give up their way of life in this
western industrialized society and
go back to basics in a more primi-
tive, natural environment.
The basis of a “rational” approach
to happiness is that change must ﬁrst
take place within you. People fre-
quently demand and expect that
others must change ﬁrst or their
world must change ﬁrst, before
they can be happy. People often
blame the outside world for their
unhappiness and in so doing fail to
see their own ability to make them-
selves feel happier.
This is not to say that the outside
world has no inﬂuence over your
unhappiness. Of course it does.
However, the road to increased hap-
piness lies in your awareness that no
matter how onerous a life you are
experiencing–frequemlv through no
fault of your own–you can, by
changing yourself, become happier
and either continue to live in the
present
circumstances
or
make
some changes.
Barbara has been married to Frank
for 15 years and for most of that time
has not enjoyed the relationship.
Successfully employed as an account
executive in an advertising ﬁrm, she
dreads going home at night because
Frank still treats her like a little girl,
expects her to do all of the domestic
chores, and doesn’t respect her pro-
fessionally. Barbara’s unhappiness
stems from blaming Frank for being
so insensitive, from not being able to
change him, and from not being able
to ﬁnd the courage to leave him.
For Barbara to become happier,
she ﬁrst has to stop blaming Frank or
her circumstances. She can learn to
control her anger with Frank by be-
coming more tolerant and giving
him the right to be wrong. By reduc-
ing her anger toward him. she will be
in a much stronger position to mo-
tivate him tochange.Alternatively, if
she weighs the positives against the
negatives and decides to leave him,
she will need to acquire some ratio-
nal attitudes and skills to help her
tolerate the considerable short-term
discomforts of separating from a
man with whom she has lived for
so long.
A rational approach to happiness
embraces a scientiﬁc and objective
way of thinking whereby you are
able to inﬂuence your emotional
and behavioral actions by reﬂecting
upon them and evaluating the extent
to which they may help you attain
your
short-term
and
long-term
goals. If Stan took people’s actions
A Rational Approach to Happiness
293

less personally, he would be able to
see that his anger is doing him in at
work and he would be better able to
modify his self-defeating behavior.
Unfortunately, his subjective way
of looking at others at work and
blaming them for their imperfec-
tions prevents him from getting
ahead. Rational also means having
an accepting and tolerant point of
view. Accepting means acknowledg-
ing one’s own and others’ imperfec-
tions
and
differences
and
not
insisting that you or they shouldn’t
be the way you or they are. Eva, who
is angry with her mother, is not
accepting of her mother’s irrational
behavior, nor is she accepting of her
own fallibilities and the mistakes she
makes whenever she gets furious
with her mother. Tolerance means
putting up with life’s hardships and
discomforts without thinking that life
should not be that way. Bill makes his
goal of ﬁnding happiness with a love
mate much more difﬁcult by not
accepting the fact that it is often
hard and unpleasant to meet differ-
ent people, one of whom might be
the right person.
The following is a list of ten ratio-
nal attitudes and values that can help
you become happier in your life.
1
Don’t blame others for making
you unhappy. Take responsibi-
lity for making yourself happy.
In the case of Eva, she is living in
a situation that most of us would
consider
unreasonable.
Her
mother makes excessive and un-
remitting demands. If Eva tells
herself, “My mother makes me
so unhappy.” she will wait for
her mother to change before be-
coming happier. We know Eva’s
mother
will
probably
not
change. However, if Eva adopts
thepointofviewthatshecanstill
be happy in her life (though
not as happy) even with her
mother’s unfair demands, she
will be well on the road to im-
proved happiness.
2
Give yourself permission to
make yourself happy–even if,
as a result, others make them-
selves unhappy. This is not a
call for rampant selﬁsh-ness.
Rather it is a recognition that
you havearightto behappyand
that sometimes you will have to
do things like making time for
yourself (and. therefore, less
time for others) even though
others will upset themselves
and get angry and tell you that
you shouldn’t be that way.
3
Do things that bring you plea-
sure and enjoyment in the
short-term.
Sometimes
you
can be unhappy because either
you are making excessive sacri-
ﬁces to achieve what you want
in the long-term or are giving
too much of yourself away to
others in the short-term. While
hedonism and pleasure are not
the same as happiness, it has
been my experience that you
can become happier by doing
small and pleasurable things for
yourself now.
4
Do things for others and your
community without expecting
anything back in return. The
most unhappy people I know
calculate everything they put
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
294

into a relationship in terms of
what they are getting out of it.
The less their partner puts in.
the less they put in. Also, the
happiest people I know are
involved in doing some kind
of volunteer work for others.
While it’s hard to give uncon-
ditionally, especially when you
are feeling somewhat empty
inside, I suggest giving it a try.
5
In order to achieve long-term
gains, you often have to sacri-
ﬁce short-term pleasures and
put up with short-term dis-
comforts.Relationshipsaredif-
ﬁcult, no matter how good they
are.If youwanttostay inalong-
term relationship you have to
adopt a view that allows you to
accept–even though you do not
like–the frustrations of living
with another person. And if
you want to get out of a rela-
tionship because you consider
that you will not be happy in it
in the long run, you also have
to be prepared to tolerate the
extreme tension and anxiety of
breaking up. At work, it is most
important that you have an at-
tiude that helps you to do those
onerous and frustrating tasks
that will help you get what
you want in the long-term.
6
Accept the fallibility of others.
Those people I know who are
unhappy and angry with others
at home and work, such as Stan
and Eva, fail to accept the fact
that other people will act badly
and inconsiderately some of the
time and will make mistakes.
Rather than accepting this fact
and trying to do something
constructive about it, they en-
rage themselves by irrationally
believing that people shouldn’t
behave that way. Giving others
the right to be wrong saves you a
pain in the gut.
Diane, a 34-year-old home-
maker and mother of two
young children, is extremely
unhappy at home and is not
enjoying parenting. She con-
tinuously upsets herself about
her two toddlers’ raucous and
disobedient behavior by mis-
takenly believing that her chil-
dren make her unhappy. Diane
fails to acknowledge that her
own attitudes are partly re-
sponsible for making her feel
stressed. Not only does she
stress herself by blaming her
children, she also gets upset
because she thinks she is a total
failure because her kids from
time to time fail to obey her.
Diane can begin lo become a
happier parent by not putting
herself down for her children’s
frustrating behavior. She can
make herself happier by adopt-
ing the attitude that “1 am a
good parent even though my
children are not behaving well.
I would like to bemore effective,
but when I’m not, that’s too)
bad.”
7
Don’t take things personally.
This is at the very heart of un-
happiness. Unhappy people put
themselves down when they get
rejected by signiﬁcant people in
their lives or are not successful
at work.
A Rational Approach to Happiness

Kenneth is beginning 12th
grade with great dread. He
knows that it is an important
year and is miserable about the
prospects of not achieving well.
While Kenneth has achieved
very good results in the past,
both he and his parents antici-
pate that the year will be – as
usual – an unhappy and stress-
ful one for Ken and his family.
WhyisKennethsounhappy?
Because deep down he has a
very high need for approval
and fears that if his results
are not the very best, both his
parents and his friends will
think badly of him. He can
help himself become happier
by realizing that even if people
do think badly of him, he is a
worthwhile person. In Ken’s
case, it is true that his father
has
very
high
expectations
for him, and Kenneth could
become happier if his father
changed. However, even if his
father doesn’t change. Ken can
become
less
stressed
about
school by rationally telling him-
self. “I prefer to be approved of
byimportantpeople,butIdon’t
need to be. It’s not the end of the
world to be criticized – I can
stand it. And I am a valuable
person even when people think
badly of my behavior.”
Replaceyourtendencytoput
yourself down with a view of
yourself that includes both the
positives and the negatives, and
recognize that it is not sensible
to use any oneincident or even a
list of incidents in one or more
areas of your life as a measure of
your total self-worth.
8
Take some chances – both at
work and in your personal
relationships – even though
you might fail. Do you remem-
ber Bill, who stays at home
rather than risk rejection and
failure in dating? He would be
much happier if he were more
willing to take risks.
9
Itdoesn’tmattersomuchwhat
people think about you and
what you are doing. Happy
people realize that sometimes
they have to go against conven-
tion in order to accomplish
their goals and ﬁnd the right
person to love.
10
See uncertainty as a challenge;
don’t be afraid of it. In order to
get ahead in life, happy people
are prepared to gamble a bit
with their security and are will-
ing at times to put themselves in
challengingcircumstanceswhere
they do not have control over
what might happen.
Increased happiness is available
to everyone. Becoming aware of
your own attitudes that are letting
you down is a ﬁrst step in moving
yourself to a happier life. Once you
make some adjustment in the way
you think about yourself, you will
ﬁnd it easier to make the changes in
your actions that can bring you
happiness.
Workhardatﬁndingtherightsort
of person, who will love you in a way
that satisﬁes you and whose love you
can return. Commit yourself to
achieving excellence in some area
Rationality and the Pursuit of Happiness
296

of work and creative endeavor. And
ﬁnally, take some positive steps to-
day to begin to take better care of
yourself. Decide which activities will
bring you pleasure and enjoyment
and then do them.
Finding happiness is a lifelong en-
terprise with many ups and downs.
A rational approach to happiness

with actions, can help you achieve
your goals of becoming happier and
