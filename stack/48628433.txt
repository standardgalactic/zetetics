SUMMARY 
 
To increase the heat or mass transfer across an interface by increasing the interfacial 
area, gas dispersion through submerged orifices is an efficient and commonly used 
method in a wide range of process equipment. To date, numerous theoretical and 
experimental studies have been reported in the field of bubble formation at a 
submerged orifice and many models have been developed to clarify the effects of 
various factors on bubble formation. However, the effects of the boundaries around the 
bubble formation system were not taken into account in most of these studies. It has 
generally been assumed that the bubble column is very large compared with the orifice 
size and the wall effect could be neglected. In this study, the wall effect on bubble 
formation was investigated experimentally and theoretically. 
Since the flow field around the bubble is assumed to be irrotational and the viscosity of 
the liquid is negligible, a fundamental non-spherical model was developed by means of 
the boundary integral method to predict the bubble formation process. This model was 
validated through the comparison of the theoretical predictions with the experimental 
results from the literature reported.  
To study the wall effect experimentally, three sizes of bubble column with diameters, 
. .
I Dφ 30mm×470mm, 
. .
I Dφ 50mm×470mm and 
. .
I Dφ 100mm×470mm, were 
designed. High-speed video images and high sensitive dynamic pressure transducer 
were applied to visualize bubble formation process and record the instantaneous 
pressure fluctuation in the gas chamber respectively. Bubbling frequency was obtained 
from the time-pressure signals via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). It was observed that 
there are three distinct bubbling regimes, single bubbling, pairing and multiple

bubbling, and as the ratio of the column diameter to orifice diameter decreases, the 
bubbling regimes generally transition from single bubbling to pairing and eventually 
multiple bubbling, with a corresponding decrease in bubbling frequency. Pairing and 
multiple bubbling are more likely to occur with large chamber volumes and high gas 
flow rates.   
To study the wall effect theoretically, a specific system of images was introduced into 
the fundamental non-spherical model to satisfy the no-flux boundary condition on the 
impermeable column wall. Comparison of experimental results for bubbling frequency 
with the theoretical predictions shows that the agreement is good, i.e. the model 
successfully predicts the effect of the column wall on bubbling frequency. To 
thoroughly understand the underlying mechanism and take into account the 
bubble-bubble interaction as well as the bubble-wall interaction, a further spherical 
model was developed using potential flow theory. It was observed that this model can 
predict the bubble formation process very well and it also can predict the occurrence of 
pairing and multiple bubbling.

1.1 Background 
Operations involving mass or heat transfer across an interface are very common in the 
chemical industry. To obtain rapid transfer rate in equipment of finite size, a large 
interfacial area per unit volume is preferred in such operations. There are three 
common methods used to satisfy this requirement, which include film method, rupture 
of bulk fluid and gas dispersion through submerged orifices. Among them, gas 
dispersion through submerged orifices, which permits equipment of extremely simple 
design and leads to reasonably large interfacial areas, is the most efficient and most 
commonly used one in process equipment such as distillation columns, absorption 
towers, flotation cells, bubble columns, air-lift vessels, aerated stirred tanks, biological 
wastewater treatment systems and metallurgical smelters. Thus the formation of 
bubbles, the first stage in gas dispersion, becomes an important aspect to study the 
process of dispersion.  
Bubbles are formed by the flow of gas through orifices submerged in a liquid. In the 
design or operation of gas-liquid contacting equipment, it is essential to clarify the 
factors affecting bubble formation and to understand the underlying mechanisms, so 
that the coalescence and breakdown of bubbles are not serious. Although practical 
applications usually involve the simultaneous participation of many bubbles, most 
experimental and theoretical studies of bubble formation have been concerned with a 
single bubble. The reason is that the multiple bubbles studies are very complicated, and 
it has been generally difficult to draw definite conclusions from such studies. Thence

bubble formation at a single orifice, the simplest one, is usually studied by most of the 
researchers because it excludes mutual influence of bubbles formed in neighboring 
orifices. Although the effect of adjacent orifices is neglected, the study of bubble 
formation at a single orifice yields statistical information concerning the factors and 
also gives insight into the dynamics of the process. The understanding of the 
underlying mechanisms of this condition will contribute to studies on the mechanism 
with many orifices. 
Over the past decades, numerous theoretical and experimental studies have been 
reported in the field of bubble formation. However, for most of the previous studies, 
there are some assumptions that the size of the bubble column is greatly larger than the 
orifice. Thus, the whole domain for bubble formation under consideration is seen as an 
infinite system and the wall effect of the bubble column could be neglected. This is 
true when the column diameter is very large compared with the orifice diameter. 
However, it is observed that the bubble behavior is modified as the column becomes 
smaller. Although much work has been done up to date on bubble formation, there is 
no comprehensive model which includes the effects of boundary factors, such as 
orifice plate and wall of the bubble column. 
 
1.2 Objective of present study 
The principal objectives of the present study were to:  
1. Develop a fundamental non-spherical model to predict bubble formation at a 
submerged orifice with the boundary integral method.

2. Investigate the effect of the bubble column wall on bubble formation 
experimentally and theoretically. Based on the fundamental non-spherical model, 
the wall effect is investigated theoretically with an introduction of a specific image 
system.  
3. Develop a spherical model using potential flow theory, which takes into account 
the bubble-bubble and bubble-wall interactions in bubble formation. 
This study may lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of bubble 
formation in which the effects of the boundaries are considered. Also the contribution 
of the liquid circulation on the bubble formation is included in this study, which may 
be of practical importance to the design and operation of gas-liquid contacting process 
equipment. 
 
1.3 Organization 
To understand the underlying mechanism of bubble formation, it is necessary to review 
previous works studied by other researchers in this field. In Chapter 2, a detailed 
review of the theoretical and experimental research into bubble formation under 
various conditions will be presented. In addition, previous studies on bubble wake and 
wall effect on bubble formation will be discussed. 
Chapter 3 gives an introduction of the boundary integral method and develops a 
theoretical model for bubble formation at a single orifice with this method. In addition, 
a model for the wall effect on bubble formation is developed using this method with an 
introduction of a specific image system.

Experimental work of wall effect on bubble formation will be described in Chapter 4, 
in which the experimental apparatus, measurement techniques, and experimental 
conditions and procedures will be introduced. Results and discussion of modeling of 
bubble formation and wall effect on bubble formation will be described in Chapter 5. 
To obtain a comprehensive understanding about the bubble-bubble interaction as well 
as the bubble-wall interaction in bubble formation, a further spherical model is 
developed using potential flow theory in Chapter 6. The results and the comparison of 
the theoretical predictions and the experimental results will be also addressed. 
Conclusions and recommendations arising from this study are summarized in Chapter

2.1 Introduction 
Bubble formation at a single submerged orifice has been investigated experimentally 
and theoretically in the past decades. Although practical applications may involve 
bubble formation at multiple orifices and a single orifice is rarely used in the gas-liquid 
contacting equipment in industry, an understanding of the fundamental process of 
bubble formation at a single orifice is a necessary prior to the investigation of 
equipment with multiple orifices.  
This chapter first reviews the bubbling regimes at a submerged orifice in Section 2.2. 
Three main bubbling regimes, static, dynamic and jetting, are observed in order of 
increasing gas flow rate.  
The performance of bubble formation is affected by many factors which include 
equipment variables, operating conditions and properties of the gas and liquid phases. 
It is very important to understand the effects of each factor so that devices, such as 
sieve tray columns, could be reliably and efficiently designed and controlled. The 
detailed discussion of these factors will be presented in Section 2.3.  
Many theoretical models have been developed to describe bubble formation. These 
models will be discussed in Section 2.4. Literature pertinent to the bubble wake and 
the wall effect on bubble formation are presented in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 respectively. 
Finally, a brief summary is presented in Section 2.7.

2.2 Bubbling regimes 
On the basis of experimental results, most researchers agree that there are three clearly 
defined regimes of bubbling. Beginning with small gas flow rate, these are static, 
dynamic and jetting regimes. The transition between each regime is not precise and 
depends on liquid physical properties, orifice size and chamber volume. 
2.2.1 Static regime 
The static regime occurs under the condition where only bubble buoyancy and surface 
tension play significant roles and there is equality between these two forces throughout 
the bubble formation. The gas flow rate is normally very low (< 1 cm3/s) (Van 
Krevelen and Hoftijzer, 1950) and bubble remains a constant value at the detachment. 
The bubble volume is determined by orifice diameter and surface tension but is 
independent of gas flow rate as follows:

also called the “constant volume regime” which occurs when a dimensionless

2.2.2 Dynamic regime 
The dynamic regime is also called the “slowly increasing volume region” by some 
investigators. In this regime, the gas flow rate is much higher and both bubble volume 
and frequency increase with the increase of gas flow rate (
Re
100
N
>
).  
A more detailed discussion of bubble patterns in this regime has been reported by 
McCann and Prince (1971). Bubbling patterns were categorized into six modes as 
follows: 
I. 
Single bubbling: Bubbles grows successively and discretely and there is no 
significant interaction between any two bubbles. It takes place when chamber 
volumes are small and gas flow rates are low.  
II. 
Pairing: It occurs at low and moderate gas flow rates in the case of very large 
chamber volumes. The detachment of the bubble can cause an intermediate 
formation of an elongated gas tube due to the remaining pressure difference 
between chamber pressure and orifice pressure at the moment of the 
detachment. The gas tube then quickly elongates and joins with the bubble, 
connecting it momentarily with the orifice. After this tube breaks rapidly at the 
orifice, it moves into the preceding bubble. 
III. 
Double bubbling: It occurs only at high gas flow rate or low chamber volumes. 
The second bubble is sucked into the preceding one due to a wake force caused 
by it and then two bubbles merger together and rise as one. The phenomenon is 
similar with pairing except that the second bubble cannot be regarded as a tube 
since its size is almost the same as the preceding bubble.

IV. 
Double pairing: Similar in behavior to double bubbling except that each is a 
pair. 
V. 
Single bubbling with delayed release: The bubbling pattern is very similar to 
pairing except that there is no clear separation between the first bubble and the 
small gas tube. 
VI. 
Double bubbling with delayed release: The bubbling behavior is very similar to 
single bubbling with delayed release except that there is also double bubbling 
as a following sequence behind each single delayed release behavior. 
In particular, McCann and Prince (1971) compared the phenomena of pairing and 
double bubbling, as shown in Table 2.1.

2.2.3 Jetting regime  
With an increase of the gas flow rate, the bubbling regime loses its stability. Bubbling 
is characterized by the onset of rapid sequential formation of bursts. This regime is 
called the “jetting regime”. The phenomenon of jetting normally occurs at higher 
Reynolds number (

) (McNallan and King (1982)).

2.3 Physical factors affecting bubble formation 
Many factors have been investigated having influence on bubble formation at a single 
submerged orifice. In general, these factors are related to the physical construction of 
the bubbling system as well as the gas and liquid properties. These factors may be 
classified according to Kumar and Kuloor (1970), McCann and Prince (1971), and 
Tsuge and Hibino (1983) as: equipment variables (e.g., orifice diameter, chamber

10
volume, etc.), system variables (e.g., liquid properties, gas properties, etc.), and 
operating variables (e.g., gas flow rate, static system pressure, liquid depth, bulk liquid 
motion, etc.).  
2.3.1 Orifice diameter 
Orifice diameter effects depend on bubbling regimes as well as bubble formation 
conditions. In the static regime, the volume of the bubble is proportional to the orifice 
diameter as expected from Equation (2.1). In the dynamic regime, orifice diameter is 
unimportant for a constant flow condition (
0
→
c
V
), but at a constant pressure 
condition (
∞
→
c
V
) and intermediate condition, the flow through the orifice is 
proportional to the cross sectional area, making the orifice diameter a very important 
factor. Additionally, a larger orifice diameter also gives rise to a larger line tension 
force at the gas-liquid-solid interface, increasing resistance to bubble detachment and 
therefore resulting in a larger bubble volume (Mittoni, 1997). In the turbulent regime, 
bubble volume is independent of orifice diameter and depends on the stochastic 
breakup of the gas jet.  
2.3.2 Chamber volume 
Gas chamber volume has a significant effect on bubble formation. In terms of the 
chamber volume, bubble formation can be categorized into constant flow, constant 
pressure, and intermediate conditions. The two limits of chamber volume (
0
→
c
V
 
and 
∞
→
c
V
) define the special cases of constant flow and constant pressure 
conditions, respectively. 
Constant flow condition occurs in small gas chamber volume systems, corresponding 

Chapter 2                                               Literature review 
 
11
to large orifice pressure drop due to either high gas flow rate or large orifice resistance. 
The changes in the gas chamber or bubble pressure have a relatively small effect on the 
pressure drop. The gas flow rate tends toward a constant value. 
The occurrence of constant pressure arises for a large chamber volume and fixed 
chamber pressure (Kupferberg and Jameson, 1969; Park et al., 1977). Under such a 
condition, the pressure fluctuation due to the bubble formation and detachment is small. 
Therefore the chamber pressure remains virtually constant. 
A dimensionless capacitance number, 
c
N , first proposed by Hughes et al. (1955), is 
generally applied to describe chamber volume effects as follows:

where Vc is the gas chamber volume and co is the velocity of sound in the gas. Hughes 
et al. postulated that

2.3.3 Liquid properties 
Liquid physical properties which affect bubble formation include viscosity, density and 
surface tension.  
It is generally accepted that viscosity affects the bubble volume insignificantly at lower 
gas flow rates and lower liquid viscosities; while at large gas flow rates and high 
viscosities, the viscosity effects on bubble volume become significant due to the high 
drag force retarding upward acceleration of the bubble. Miyahara et al. (1983) 
investigated the effects of liquid viscosities on bubble formation both experimentally 
and numerically. The orifice diameters ranged from 1.0 and 3.0 mm and liquid 
viscosities ranged from 0.001 to 0.147
/
kg m s⋅. The two-stage bubble formation 
model developed in the investigation was in agreement with experimental observations. 
The results illustrated that larger viscosities caused larger bubble volumes because it 
decreased bubble rise velocity and allowed more gas to enter the bubble before 
detachment. Terasaka and Tsuge (1990) improved the non-spherical model proposed 
by Pinczewski (1981) by including a viscosity term in the motion of the bubble and 
modifying the equivalent radius definition. Agreement with experimental data from 
their own study as well as other researchers was close for liquid viscosities between 
0.001 and 1.1
/
kg m s⋅ under atmospheric conditions. 
Besides viscosity, liquid density is also a factor affecting bubble formation. In general, 
higher liquid density causes higher bubble buoyancy which forces the bubble to detach 

Chapter 2                                               Literature review 
 
13
with a smaller volume if surface tension remains constant. Davidson and Schüler 
(1960a) concluded that liquid density had insignificant effects on the bubble volume at 
high gas flow rates because the relative increase of the liquid inertia retarded the 
increase of the buoyancy. Meanwhile, a higher liquid density could increase the 
pressure gradient during bubble formation, resulting in increased gas flow rates into 
the bubble. McCann and Prince (1969) also suggested that the pressure at the orifice 
which depended on the liquid density determined the gas flow into the bubble. These 
evidences of the weak dependence on density might be due to the low chamber 
volumes used by many researchers, thereby restricting their studies to constant gas 
flow conditions. 
Surface tension is one of the most important factors determining the bubble size at 
vanishingly small flow rates, however, it assumes much less importance at higher flow 
rates. The significance of surface tension also decreases with the increase of the bubble 
diameter. Al-Hayes and Winterton (1981) described the growth of air bubbles in water, 
water with surfactants, and ethylene glycol on various surfaces exhibiting different 
contact angles. They concluded that for the surface active agents used there was little 
evidence that they produced a skin around the bubble that significantly impeded the 
mass transfer.     
2.3.4 Gas properties 
It is generally accepted that gas density, pressure and heat capacity can influence 
bubble formation. While molecular weight of gas is considered to have a weak 
negative impact on the bubble volume in the gas-liquid contacting system.  
Davidson and Schüler (1960a) found that bubble volume decreased 1.8% when 

Chapter 2                                               Literature review 
 
14
changing the gas from air to carbon dioxide for a gas flow rate of 17 ml/s under 
constant flow condition, owing to the difference of the gas momentum caused by 
different gas densities. 
LaNauze and Harris (1974) showed experimentally that gas density had a significant 
impact on the gas momentum and the capacity of the gas chamber by increasing the 
pressure in the gas phase of carbon dioxide up to 2.0 MPa. The experimental results 
showed to be in good agreement with the mathematical model proposed by LaNauze 
and Harris (1974). 
Tsuge and Hibino (1983) stated that the specific heat ratio of gas, γ , also affected 
bubble volume depending on the dimensionless capacitance number 
'
c
N . When 
'
c
N  
was small, bubble volumes were affected mainly by the specific heat ratio of the gas, 
but when 
'
c
N  was large, they were affected strongly by gas density. 
Wilkinson and Van Dierendonck (1994) found that an increase of gas density for large 
chamber volumes can lead to smaller bubble at formation due to an increase in gas 
momentum, an increase in pressure drop at the orifice and an increased rate of bubble 
necking. 
The viscosity of the gas is generally expected to have insignificant effects on bubble 
formation, but it has an appreciable effect in impeding the gas flow into the bubble. 
Fountain (1988) stated that the weak influence of gas viscosity determined pressure 
drop and supply conditions of the gas delivery system, and the effect was significant 
only when injecting through long thin tuyeres.

2.3.5 Gas flow rate 
Gas flow rate has a significant effect on bubble volume as well as bubble frequency. 
There exists a general agreement on the pattern of bubble volume variation when the 
flow rate is increased. In the static regime, as the flow rate is gradually increased from 
zero, the bubble volume which could be obtained with Equation (2.1) remains fairly 
independent of the flow rate, whereas the frequency increases. In the dynamics regime, 
with the increase of the flow rate, at first both the bubble volume and the frequency 
increase, but later on a stage is reached where the frequency remains essentially 
constant whereas the bubble volume continues to increase. Though these regions are 
observed for all the systems studied, the conditions under which one region ends and 
the other begin are not clear. Finally, with the increase of the gas flow rate, the bubble 
formation process loses its stability and is characterized as jetting regime. 
2.3.6 Static system pressure 
LaNauze and Harris (1974) investigated the effect of elevated system pressure on 
submerged gas injection. They found that the bubble size decreased significantly with 
the increase of the system pressure, especially at high gas flow rate. The relationship 
between bubble volume and gas flow rate became non-linear at higher system 
pressures. LaNauze and Harris (1974) also found that higher pressures affected the 
coalescence behavior between successive bubbles for a given gas flow rate. The 
increased gas momentum due to the higher system pressure led to a smaller bubble 
volume and hence reduced the time delay between individual bubbles. 
Wilkinson and Dierendonck (1990) stated that the influence of both pressure and gas 
molecular weight on bubble formation had same cause. The effect of pressure on the 

Chapter 2                                               Literature review 
 
16
bubble size could be explained by the decrease in bubble stability with increasing gas 
density. 
Tsuge et al. (1992) studied the effect of system pressure under the conditions of gas 
chamber volume 12.8 cm3, orifice diameter 1.18 mm, and gas chamber volume 368 
cm3, orifice diameter 1.48 mm, respectively. They found that bubble volume decreased 
with the increase of system pressure both experimentally and theoretically.   
2.3.7 Liquid depth 
Liquid depth is chosen as one of the variables in the studies of bubble formation. It is 
generally agreed that this variable does not influence the bubble volume at the tip. This 
fact has been verified when the liquid depth was greater than approximately two 
bubble diameters (Davidson and Amick, 1956; Hayes et al., 1959).  
However, Khurana and Kumar (1969) indicated that only under constant flow and 
constant pressure conditions, bubble volumes were not significantly influenced by the 
liquid depth. While for the intermediate condition, bubble volumes were observed to 
decrease exponentially with the increase of the liquid depth from 15 cm to 128 cm for 
orifice diameter 3 mm. Iliadis et al. (2000) investigated the influence of the liquid 
depth on bubble formation for various orifice diameter and gas chamber volume in the 
single bubbling region. They found that the bubble size increased with the increase of 
the liquid depth in the range of 10 to 150 cm with the conditions of orifice diameters 
from 1.15 to 4.35 mm and chamber volume from 150 to 7000 cm3.  
2.3.8 Bulk liquid motion 
There are two types of bulk liquid motion, namely erratic liquid oscillation and forced 

Chapter 2                                               Literature review 
 
17
liquid bulk flow. The former is induced by bubble formation and upward rising motion 
and it is very difficult to account for rigorously. The later is evoked by means of 
external force exerted on the liquid body and most of the investigations about the 
effect of liquid flow on bubble formation have been focused on it. 
Bubble formation in co-flowing or counter-flowing liquid under constant gas flow 
conditions has been investigated both experimentally and theoretically (Sada et al., 
1978; Takahashi et al., 1980; Fawkner et al., 1990 and Chen and Tan, 2002). All the 
investigations reported that the bubble volume decreased with increasing superficial 
liquid velocity. 
Bubble formation with cross-flowing liquid is another case usually met in many 
industrial gas-liquid operations. The liquid motion results in a drag force on the 
growing bubble, thereby causing earlier bubble detachment and producing smaller 
bubbles when compared with formation under stagnant or quiescent liquid conditions. 
Another advantage of cross-flowing liquid is that the detached bubbles tend to be 
swept away from the region of the orifice, thereby reducing the likelihood of 
coalescence. Theoretical models for bubble formation with cross-flowing liquid have 
been developed by Tsuge et al. (1981), Wace et al. (1987), Marshall et al. (1993), Kim 
et al. (1994), Tan et al. (2000) and Zhang and Tan (2003).  
2.4 Mathematic modeling 
Most theoretical studies of bubble formation have been concentrated on the single 
bubble formation in a quiescent liquid. The extensive theoretical study on this subject 
gives a fundamental understanding of the bubble formation process, growth and 
detachment size and detachment time throughout a wide range of conditions of gas

flow rate, chamber volume, orifice size, gas and liquid properties as well as system 
pressure. Some reviews on this area include the articles by Kumar and Kuloor (1970), 
Tsuge (1986), Tan and Harris (1986), and the monographs by Clift et al. (1978), Sadhal 
et al. (1997).  
In general, the existing models for bubble formation in a quiescent liquid can be 
classified into two broad categories, i.e., spherical models and non-spherical models.   
2.4.1 Spherical models 
Based on the analytical solution of force balance equations or equations of motion, 
many spherical models have been developed (Davidson and Schüler, 1960a, b; 
Khurana and Kumar, 1969; LaNauze and Harris, 1972; and Tsuge and Hibino, 1983). 
According to the definition of the bubble formation stages, these models could be 
classified into one-stage model, two-stage model and three-stage model.  
2.4.1.1 One-stage models 
Davidson and Schüler (1960a, b) proposed a series of one-stage models to describe 
bubble formation in both viscous and inviscid liquids for the two main bubbling 
regimes, i.e., constant flow and constant pressure regimes. The schematic diagram of 
the idealized one-stage model of Davidson and Schüler (1960a) is shown in Figure 2.2. 
It was assumed that the bubble detached when the vertical distance between the center 
of the bubble and the point of gas supply, s , was equivalent to the final bubble radius, 
a . Thus there was no distinction between the expansion and detachment stage. It was 
assumed that the velocity of the bubble center was determined by a force balance 
between the buoyancy force and the viscous drag while neglecting the inertia term. 
Although the predicted results agreed well with the experimental data, the models were 

Chapter 2                                               Literature review

limited to be used for very small gas flow rates.  
Swope (1971) applied Newton’s second law to slow bubble formation in viscous 
liquids with pressure fluctuation in the gas chamber. The gas flow rate into the bubble 
was determined by multiplying the average gas flow rate into the chamber with the 
ratio of the bubbling time to the sum of bubbling and non-bubbling times.

With a modification of Davidson and Schüler’s (1960a, b) model, LaNauze and Harris 
(1972) developed a one-stage model for bubble formation in the constant pressure 
regime. The proposed bubble formation sequence is illustrated in Figure 2.3. Initially, 
the bubble center is at a point source of gas, the center of the upper face of the orifice. 
Its upward motion is determined by a balance between the forces acting on the bubble 
and the inertia of the liquid surrounding it. Later, LaNauze and Harris (1974) extended 
their earlier model to allow for the rate of change of gas momentum issuing through 
the orifice and variable gas chamber pressure. They studied the effects of gas 
momentum on the bubble formation at elevated pressure.

2.4.1.2 Two-stage models 
Following the development of one-stage models, two-stage models, which took the 
bubble necking into account, were proposed by Ramakrishnan et al. (1969), 
Satyanarayan et al. (1969), Khurana and Kumar (1969), Ruff (1972), and Takahashi 
and Miyahara (1976,1979). The idealized two-stage bubble formation model by 
Ramakrishnan et al. (1969) is shown in Figure 2.4. 
In the model, bubble formation was assumed to consist of two stages: expansion stage 
and detachment stage. During the first stage, expansion stage, the spherical bubble 
expands while its base remains attached to the orifice. This stage is assumed to end 
when all the forces acting on the bubble are just balanced, so that the bubble begins to 
rise. In the second stage, detachment stage, the bubble continues to grow while lifting 
up from the plate, but is still connected to the orifice by a neck. This stage terminates 
when the neck breaks off and the bubble detaches. It is assumed that the bubble 
detaches when the length of the neck reaches an empirical value. This is similar to the 
detachment criterion of Davidson and Schüler (1960a, b).

The two-stage model for bubble formation at a plate orifice submerged in an inviscid 
liquid at high gas flow rates was proposed by Wraith (1971). In the model, the 
surrounding liquid was assumed to be inviscid and of infinite extent. The gas was 
incompressible and its density was neglected. Surface tension was neglected in the 
model. Figure 2.5 shows the two successive stages schematically during bubble growth. 
At the beginning of bubble expansion from a point source, the gas bubble surface was 
assumed to be a hemisphere, with its radius equal to the orifice radius. The bubble 
became spherical about the center of mass of a hemispherical envelope at the end of 
the first stage. In the second stage, the force balance equation for a spherical bubble 
growing at the orifice was assumed to be given by the Davidson and Schüler’s (1960a, 
b) model, and neglecting the viscous force.

2.4.1.3 Three-stage models 
Although the results predicted by the previous models agreed reasonably well with 
some experimental observations, there was criticism that the models were only 
applicable in a certain range of experimental conditions. With potential flow theory, 
three-stage models were developed by several authors (Kupferberg and Jameson, 1969; 
McCann and Prince, 1969; Tsuge and Hibino, 1983). 
The idealized three-stage bubble formation model proposed by Kupferberg and 
Jameson (1969) is illustrated in Figure 2.6. The three stages are the growth stage, 
elongation stage and waiting stage. The first two stages were similar to the two-stage 
model of Ramakrishnan et al. (1969). In the waiting stage, it was assumed that there 
was no outflow of gas from the chamber after the detachment of a bubble. Hence the 
pressure in the chamber increased and the next bubble began to form. During a part of 
waiting stage, weeping through the orifice might occur. Potential flow theory was 
employed in the model to calculate bubble and liquid motion.

Fig. 2.6 Three-stage model in a quiescent liquid by Kupferberg and Jameson (1969) 
Independently with Kupferberg and Jameson (1969), McCann and Prince (1969) 
derived a potential flow theory to describe the gas flow from the gas chamber into an 
expanding, rising spherical bubble forming at the orifice, by taking into account the 
wake behind preceding bubble. 
Tsuge and Hibino (1983) proposed another three-stage model with modified potential 
flow theory. For the ideal liquid, Kupferberg and Jameson (1969) and McCann and 
Prince (1969) derived the functional form of potential velocity φ  from the potential 
flow theory, but for a real liquid it was difficult to derive theoretically the concrete 
form of potential velocity φ . Hence Tsuge and Hibino (1983) proposed that φ  was 
expressed as the product of the inertial term for the ideal liquid and a factor which was 
a function of dimensionless liquid property.  
2.4.2 Non-spherical models 
The spherical models just described in the Section 2.4.1 have assumed the spherical 
shape of the bubble and have been forced to use an empirical or semi-empirical 
criterion to determine the instant of the detachment. Non-spherical models enable

continuous computation of instantaneous shape of the bubble during its formation 
using the equations of motion for the liquid and the thermodynamic relationships for 
the gas in the bubble and the gas chamber, there is no need for the empirical 
detachment criteria because the instant of detachment comes naturally at the time when 
the neck, which develops during formation, attains zero width. In addition, the bubble 
becomes increasingly non-spherical at higher gas flow rates and higher system 
pressures and it is not good to describe the bubble as spherical. To overcome these 
limitations, non-spherical models for bubble formation were developed by a number of 
researchers.  
2.4.2.1 Non-spherical model by Marmur and Rubin 
Marmur and Rubin (1976) proposed a non-spherical model which showed a significant 
forward leap over the previous spherical models. Their model assumed an inviscid 
liquid, with liquid inertia calculated through the “added mass” concept of inviscid flow 
theory. The growing bubble was a volume of revolution around the vertical axis. The 
gas-liquid interface was divided into a number of small elements and the position of 
each element at any time instant was determined by the time-dependent force balance. 
Each element was acted upon by the pressure difference between the gas and the liquid 
and by the surface tension force. For a static interface these forces were in equilibrium, 
but in dynamic formation the resultant of these forces was equal to the rate of change 
in the liquid momentum, assuming that the gas momentum was negligible. In order to 
avoid the extremely complicated solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for the 
motion of the liquid, the momentum of the liquid was determined by using the “added 
mass” concept and the velocity of the interface. The effect of the chamber volume on 
bubble formation was analyzed by applying thermodynamic equations for the gas in 

Chapter 2                                               Literature review 
 
25
the bubble and the chamber below the orifice plate. A finite difference procedure was 
subsequently used to solve the equations of motion for each element. 
In contrast with previous spherical models, this model was able to predict the 
instantaneous shape of the bubble during its formation. The bubble shapes predicted 
agreed well with video images taken by researchers such as Kupferberg and Jameson 
(1969). 
Although the results predicted by this model were in good agreement with 
experimental data, there were several shortcomings. Contributions due to gas 
momentum and liquid circulation around the bubble were neglected in this model. It 
had been shown that gas momentum had a significant effect on bubble growth at high 
system pressures (LaNauze and Harris, 1974). Hence this model was limited to low 
gas flow rates and atmospheric conditions. In addition, an empirical added mass 
coefficient of 0.85 was used to provide a good fit to the data. This was in contrast to 
the widely accepted value of 11/16, which was based on the hydrodynamics of a 
sphere moving perpendicularly to the wall in an inviscid fluid (Milne-Thomson, 1968). 
2.4.2.2 Non-spherical model by Pinczewski 
The model proposed by Pinczewski (1981) extended the description of bubble 
formation by including the effect of gas momentum. The contribution of gas 
momentum was introduced by assuming a pressure distribution due to spherical vortex 
motion of the gas within the bubble. An initial “expansion” stage was described by the 
modified Rayleigh equation of motion for a spherically expanding bubble:

where the four terms on the RHS of Equation (2.4) represented the inertia, surface 
tension, viscous forces, and the pressure distribution due to gas motion, respectively. 
The equation was assumed to be equally valid for any point on a non-spherical surface

R  were the principal radii of curvature. 
A static buoyancy force was used to determine the instant of “lift-off” and the 
commencement of a stage when “expansion” and “vertical translation” occurred 
simultaneously.  
Although this model was able to provide a more general description of bubble 
formation, which would be applicable to a wider range of gas flow rates and system 
pressures, there were several inadequacies. The spherical equation of motion and 
spherical gas stream function were applied to model bubble formation. In addition, the 
two-stage approach to bubble formation used in the model contained fundamental 
theoretical weaknesses. 
Terasaka and Tsuge (1990) adopted Pinczewski’s approach and proposed a modified 
theoretical model for bubble formation in viscous liquids. The schematic diagram of 
the non-spherical model by Terasaka and Tsuge (1990) is shown in Figure 2.7. In their 
model, the equivalent radius R was only used for surface tension, and R2, the distance 
from the bubble’s symmetrical axis to the element i throughout the point O, was used 
for inertial and viscous forces as the characteristic radius. The expansion of the

non-spherical model still contained the same inadequacies as presented in the original 
model by Pinczewski. 
Li et al. (2002) developed a non-spherical bubble formation model by revising that of 
Pinczewski (1981), which was used in Newtonian fluids, to take into account the fluid 
rheological properties. In their model, the influence of in-line interactions between 
bubbles due to the fluid memory effects of the viscoelastic characteristics was taken 
into account. Their model was able to compute the instantaneous growing shape of the 
bubble during its formation and determine the final size of detachment as well as the 
frequency of bubble formation. However, their model also contained the same 
disadvantage as presented in the original model by Pinczewski, in that the equivalent 
radius was used in two spherical equations of motion: the radial expansion and vertical 
ascension of the bubble interface. 
 
2.4.2.3 Non-spherical model by Zughbi et al. 
Zughbi et al. (1983) were one of the earliest researchers attempting the modeling of 
bubble formation by the rigorous numerical solution of liquid field around the bubble. 
A fundamental analysis of the motion of the liquid surrounding the bubble and its 
influence on bubble growth were presented. The model was based on a modified 
Marker and Cell method in which the liquid region bounded by the bubble surface, the 
orifice plate, the vessel walls and the free liquid surface was divided into a number of 
cells. The unsteady, incompressible and axisymmetric Navier-Stoke equations 
describing the liquid flow field around the growing bubble were solved for each cell 
using a staggered finite difference method. Massless marker particles, which moved

with the local velocity of the liquid, were distributed along the bubble surface. 
The model prediction was in agreement with the experimental data of Kupferberg and 
Jameson (1969). Besides having the obvious advantages associated with non-spherical 
models, the model was able to predict the effects of solid walls and free liquid surface 
on bubble formation. This was an improvement over previous non-spherical models. 
However, one shortcoming of this model was its high degree of numerical complexity. 
In addition, the model did not take into account the effect of gas momentum. Therefore, 
the model was more suitable for low gas flow rates and atmospheric pressure 
conditions. 
2.4.2.4 Non-spherical model by Hooper 
Independently from Zughbi et al. (1983), Hooper (1986) proposed another model 
based on the solution of the liquid flow field around the bubble surface. The boundary 
element method was adopted in the model. The surrounding liquid was assumed to be 
inviscid and the flow was irrotational. Therefore, the velocity potential φ  could be 
introduced and it satisfied Laplace’s Equation, i.e.  
0

∇φ
                                                          (2.8) 
The derivative of φ  normal to the bubble surface was obtained with the boundary 
element method and the tangential velocity of the bubble surface could be obtained 
with the cubic spline method along the bubble surface. Whence the velocities in the 
radial and axial direction could be calculated and together with thermodynamic 
equations for the gas, the instantaneous shape of the bubble during its formation could 
be predicted.

The model presented a comprehensive analysis of the role of the surrounding liquid in 
the detachment process of the bubble and was able to compute the bubble shapes and 
streamline patterns of the liquid at various stages of bubble growth. It was found that 
the expanding and rising bubble caused unsteady stagnation point flow to occur in the 
liquid. Thus an inward flowing region of liquid existed which caused the bubble to 
neck.  
However, in Hooper’s model, the surface tension term was neglected in order to avoid 
numerical instability during bubble formation.  
2.4.2.5 Non-spherical model by Tan and Harris 
An improved non-spherical model for bubble formation was developed by Tan and 
Harris (1986). The model was based on the interfacial element method, which ascribed 
a virtual mass to each surface element of the bubble, and did not require an arbitrary 
detachment criterion, nor did it use a static “lift-off’ criterion to distinguish between 
separate stages of bubble growth. The effect of gas momentum and liquid motion were 
taken into account in their model so that their model was applicable in bubbling 
systems under high system pressure and high gas flow rates. The model predictions 
agreed very well with the experimental data of Kupferberg and Jameson (1969), 
LaNauze and Harris (1972) and Tsuge and Hibino (1978). Several other workers have 
adopted the model proposed by Tan and Harris (1986) to extend its applicability (Liow 
and Gray, 1988; Wilkinson and van Dierendonck, 1994). 
2.5 Bubble wake and rise velocity after detachment 
The term "wake" is applied, in a broad sense, to the entire region of non-zero vorticity 
downstream of a body placed in an otherwise uniform fluid flow (Fan and Tsuchiya, 

Chapter 2                                               Literature review

1990). Liquid wake pressure behind a rising bubble plays a significant role in 
determining bubble interaction (Tsuchiya et al., 1996; Chen et al., 1999; Colella et al., 
1999; Li et al., 1999). The effect of a rising bubble on subsequent ones depends on the 
bubble size and the separation distance, as indicated by Marmur and Rubin (1976): 
when the bubble is small and the time interval between consecutive bubbles drops to 
almost zero, the ascending bubble tends to delay the detachment of the forming bubble; 
when the bubble which has been formed is large, it tends to detach the forming bubble 
earlier, due to the rotational motion which is induced by it in the liquid. Compared to 
other factors, bubble wake effects have received relatively less attention.   
2.5.1 Wake pressure  
For gas bubbles formed in low viscosity liquid media (such as water), potential flow 
theory is often employed to analyze the distinct pressure field behind the bubble when 
the liquid flow is assumed as irrotational motion.  
Jameson and Kupferberg (1967) discussed the wake pressure behind a spherical bubble 
and cylindrical bubble accelerating from rest. For a spherical bubble, the expression 
for wake pressure is

Using potential flow theory, McCann and Prince (1969) analyzed the wake pressure

The subscript DET  refers to conditions on detachment and the time T has its origin at 
detachment. It was pointed out that this pressure correction to the bubble motion is 
small at low flow rates, where the distance between successive bubbles is large. As the 
flow increases, the spacing between bubbles reduces and the effect becomes more 
marked. Under these circumstances double bubbling is possible. Calculations indicate 
that 
w
P  can cause up to 20 per cent increase in bubble volume (McCann, 1969).  
Wraith and Kakutani (1974) established the pressure field for an idealized growing 
spherical gas bubble rising in an inviscid liquid from a horizontal plate-orifice and 
from a free standing nozzle on the basis of potential flow. The pressure curve is similar 
to that obtained by Jameson and Kupferberg (1967). The authors argued that the 
maximum pressure behind the bubble was responsible for the collapse of the neck 
linking the bubble and the gas source.

Nilmani (1982) considered liquid viscosity as well as the distortion of the detached 
bubble and came up with an improved approach to predict bubble wake effect. Direct 
solution of the continuity and momentum equations is obtained by the finite difference 
method. He compared his numerical simulation results with Jameson and Kupferberg's 
(1967) potential flow prediction for a two-dimensional bubble (cylindrical bubble) and 
a three-dimensional bubble (spherical bubble).  The results are shown in Fig. 2.9 and 
Fig. 2.10. Although the curve is directly obtained from solution of the transport 
equations, the trend and magnitude is nevertheless similar to the prediction of potential 
flow theory.

Due to the inherent inability of potential flow theory to model the vorticity behind 
bubbles as experimentally observed, the above approaches are flawed.  
Fan and Tsuchiya (1990) discussed the pressure distributions around rising bubbles 
based on some experimental findings and presented a simple theoretical description of 
the pressure field for an idealized vortical flow. Fig. 2.11 shows the isobaric

the boundary. The wake pressure exhibits a parabola-like profile which has a minimum 
at the vortex center. 
There is clearly a conflict between the wake pressure profile measured experimentally 
and that predicted by potential flow theory, despite its popularity. An alternative 
approach is necessary in order to effectively model the actual wake pressure effects on 
bubble formation at a submerged orifice.  
2.5.2 Rise velocity  
2.5.2.1 Initial acceleration  
The initial motion of a bubble rising from a flat surface is important in the 
determination of wake pressure (Jameson and Kupferberg, 1967). McCann and Prince 
(1969) used 
g
U D

=

 to calculate the wake pressure. Walters and Davidson (1962, 
1963) gave a potential flow analysis of the initial motion of the two-dimensional and 
three-dimensional bubbles. They verified that a two-dimensional bubble had an initial 
acceleration of g, while a three-dimensional bubble had an initial acceleration of 2g. 
However, whether the value of upward acceleration is applicable throughout the entire 
rising process is questionable, since in practice, the terminal rise velocity of the bubble 
is attained shortly after released.  
2.5.2.2 Terminal rise velocity 
In a stationary fluid of infinite extent, a bubble moving freely under the influence of 
gravity exhibits a specific rate of ascent when the terminal condition is attained. Under 
this condition, the contribution of the periodic variation in the instantaneous velocity 
due to bubble oscillation to the terminal velocity, 
b
U , is usually either sufficiently

small or nullified by taking the average (Fan and Tsuchiya, 1990). All forces acting on 
the bubble, viz., the drag, gravitational and buoyant forces, are in equilibrium at the 
terminal condition. The drag force can be presented by the drag coefficient 
D
C . When 
the body is a gas bubble of negligible density, 
D
C  is commonly defined based on an 
equivalent projected area,

, as given by

 (Harmathy, 1960). 
In view of this definition, the behaviour of the terminal rise of the bubble is often 
described in terms of 
D
C .  
It can be assumed that interfacial tension forces are ignored and flow is considered 
only in the neighbourhood of the nose, where the external fluid is assumed to flow as 
an inviscid fluid over a complete sphere or spherical of which the fluid particle forms 
the cap. The surface pressure distribution in the continuous fluid may then be 
calculated using Bernoulli’s theorem. For a spherical cap, this gives (Clift, el al.,1978):

2.6 Bubble formation with wall effect 
As discussed above, bubble formation at a submerged orifice has been investigated 
experimentally and theoretically in the past decades. However, nearly all of the 
previous studies upon bubble formation have not taken into account the dimensions of 
the bubble column. It has generally been assumed that the bubble column diameter was 
very large compared with the orifice size and that the wall effect could be neglected.  
Collins (1967) carried out a study of the influence of containing walls on the velocity 
of spherical-cap bubbles. The work was extended by Bhaga and Weber (1981) who 

Chapter 2                                               Literature review 
 
40
also investigated the influence of wall proximity on wake size, external flow fields, 
bubble shape, and skirt behaviour. Coutanceau and Thizon (1981) investigated the wall 
effect on the bubble behaviour in highly viscous liquids experimentally and 
theoretically. Krishna et al. (1999) also investigated the effect of the column diameter 
on the rise velocity of a single spherical cap bubble by introducing a scale correction 
factor which is a function of the ratio of the bubble diameter to the column diameter. 
Generally, decreasing the diameter ratio 
/
cd
d , where 
cd  is column diameter and d 
is bubble diameter, it was found to cause bubble elongation, a decrease in terminal 
velocity, a marked reduction in the wake volume and the rate of fluid circulation within 
the wake, and a delay in the onset and waviness of skirts. 
Ruzicka et al. (2001) investigated the effect of bubble column dimensions on flow 
regime transition. Bubble columns of three different diameters (
0.14,0.29,0.40
cd =
m) 
were employed in the experiment. Their study showed that decreasing column size had 
an adverse effect on the homogeneous regime stability and promoted flow regime 
transition. 
2.7 Summary 
Bubble formation at a submerged orifice has been extensively studied in recent 
decades. As discussed above, the model can be classified into two categories, i.e., 
spherical and non-spherical models. However, the focus of previous investigation is on 
those factors, such as orifice diameter, chamber volume, liquid and gas properties, gas 
flow rate, system pressure, liquid depth and liquid motion, and clearly there is no much 
studies taking into account of the wall effect. As we know, wall effect is also a factor 
influencing bubbling formation. Therefore, taking into account of the wall effect is

necessary for further study of bubble formation. 
Hooper (1986) developed a non-spherical model with the boundary integral method. 
Boundary integral method was very important for solving boundary values problem in 
PDEs. In nature, only the boundary conditions around a domain were considered, and 
the dimension of the potential problem was reduced by one with the formulation, 
which simplified the calculation. However, the model developed by Hooper (1986) 
was incomplete because the surface tension effect was not taken into account and there 
were many mathematical inconsistencies in his model. Therefore, an improved model 
with the boundary integral model is developed in this study.  
Little work was done on bubble formation with the consideration of bubble-bubble 
interaction. Zhang and Tan (2000) investigated the wake effect on bubble formation 
quite successfully. Based on model developed by Zhang and Tan (2000), this study 
attempts to model bubbling regimes with the consideration of bubble-bubble 
interaction.

Chapter 3   Improved modeling of bubble formation with 
the boundary integral method 
 
 
In this chapter an improved model, based on the one proposed by Hooper (1986), is 
developed with the inclusion of the boundary integral method and the effect of the 
surface tension. The boundary integral method is introduced in Section 3.1. Then, the 
theory and the theoretical modeling of bubble formation at a single submerged orifice 
are described in Section 3.2 and 3.3, respectively. The improvements over Hooper’s 
(1986) model are presented in Section 3.4. In Section 3.5, this model is further 
developed in modeling the wall effect on bubble formation by the introduction of a 
specific system of images.  
 
3.1 Boundary integral method 
3.1.1 Introduction 
Engineers and physical scientists are nowadays well conversed with methods such as 
finite differences or finite elements. These techniques discretize the domain of the 
problem under consideration into a number of elements or cells. The governing 
equations of the problem are then approximated over the region by functions which 
fully or partially satisfy the boundary conditions. These methods, together with other 
techniques that are applied on the domain, will be called domain methods.  
The boundary integral method was initially applied to solve elastostatics problems. 

Chapter 3 Improved modeling of bubble formation with the boundary integral method 
 
43
Later, the method was extended to a wider area, including potential problems. The 
Boundary integral method is based on Green’s formula that enables us to reformulate 
the potential problem as the solution of a Fredholm integral equation. The integral 
equation involves the potential and its normal derivative on the boundary of the region. 
This formulation has the effect of reducing the dimension of the problem by one, 
which has the advantage of rendering the technique computationally efficient, yet 
rigorous. For axisymmetric potential problems, two-dimensional integrals are reduced 
further to one-dimensional integrals by integrating through the polar angle. In this case 
the Green’s functions involve complete elliptic integrals. 
An early application of the integral technique to axisymmetric potential problems was 
by Hess and Smith (1966); their formulation was developed using a source density 
distribution on the body surface (indirect formulation) and using a linear surface, 
constant source distribution. Later, Hess (1975) improved the solution by using a 
curved surface and a source density variation over the surface. More recent application 
of this method in potential problems can be found in Blake et al. (1986, 1987), Bonnet 
(1995) and Power (1995). 
3.1.2 Formulation 
For any sufficiently smooth function, φ , which satisfies Laplace’s equation in a 
domain, Ω, having piecewise smooth surface, S, Green’s integral formula can be 
written as (Brebbia, 1978; Jaswon and Symm, 1977):

3.1.4 Approximations of the surface shape, potential and its normal 
derivative 
To proceed with the computation, we need to choose a representation for the surface, 
and also for the potential and its normal derivative on the surface. To some extent, 
these choices can be independent, but as the movement of the surface is computed 
using the potential and its normal derivative, the two should be considered together. In 
the description that follows, a plane section through the axis of symmetry of the 
surface is taken, and the potential and its normal derivative will be called functions. 
3.1.4.1 Linear surface-constant functions. (L-C) 
The surface is replaced by a set of N  linear segments Sj, with the potential and its 
normal derivative constant on each segment. The boundary integral equation is 
replaced by its collocation form using the midpoint of each linear segment:

3.1.5 Numerical integration 
The evaluation of the elements of the matrices H and G are performed numerically. 
Normally Gauss Legendre Quadrature is adequate unless the collocation point pi is 
within the segment Sj or is one of its endpoints, in which case the integrand is singular 
and must be treated specially. To remove the singularity, the singular integrals are 
separated into two terms by subtracting the logarithmic term. The quadrature scheme 
incorporating the logarithm is used to complete the integration.

3.1.6 Diagonal element of the matrix H 
After evaluating the integrals and assembling, we find the following system of 
equations:  
H
G
φ
ψ
=
                                                        (3.55) 
where the diagonal elements of the matrix, H, include the 
( )
c p  coefficients. An 
additional device proved helpful in increasing the numerical accuracy of the 
computation is to replace the diagonal elements of the matrix H by 
4

=
−∑
                                                  (3.56) 
This property may be deduced from the fact that for the interior problem, the matrix 
Equation (2.55) with φ  constant at all points on the boundary (the Dirichlet problem) 
should yield 
(
)
n
φ
ψ
∂
= ∂
 zero at all points, while ψ  specified at all points on the 
boundary (the Neumann problem) yields a solution for φ  which contains an arbitrary 
additive constant. Thus for the interior problem,

                                                     (3.57) 
and consideration of the definition of H leads immediately to Equation (2.56) for the 
exterior problem.

3.2 Theory of bubble formation 
3.2.1 Physical system and basic assumptions 
The system under consideration is shown in Fig. 3.1. Gas is pumped into a chamber at 
a constant flow rate, Q , and bubbles out through a small orifice with radius, 
or , into a 
bath of liquid.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3.1 Schematic diagram of physical system 
The following basic assumptions are made: 
(i). 
The bubble remains symmetrical about its vertical axis during the growth and is 
a volume of revolution around its vertical axis. 
(ii). 
The depth of the liquid over the plate is high enough compared with the bubble 
diameter. 
(iii). 
The influence of the gas and liquid viscosities are negligible.

(iv). 
The growth of the bubble is not affected by the presence of other bubbles. 
(v). 
The gas is ideal and the process is adiabatic. 
(vi). 
There is no energy exchange or mass transfer across the gas-liquid interface. 
3.2.2 Equations of motion for the liquid 
The viscosity of the liquid is assumed negligible and the flow is assumed to be 
irrotational. Therefore, a velocity potential exists, u

, with Laplace’s Equation:

Then, Bernoulli equation is applied between the liquid side of the bubble surface and a 
point in the liquid, which is chosen at a large distance from the orifice on the plane

3.2.5 Curvature of bubble surface 
In the absence of liquid cross-flow across the orifice, the bubble can be assumed to be 
axisymmetric, and we use a number of two-dimensional (r, z) elements to represent it. 
According to the Young-Laplace Equation, the local curvature of a certain point on the 
surface is defined as

3.3 Numerical solution strategy 
3.3.1 Initial conditions 
We assume that initially the bubble surface is a hemisphere of radius equal to the 
orifice radius. Gas is pumped into the system at a volumetric flow rate, Q, and the

As the bubble is assumed to be axisymmetric, a cylindrical coordinate system is used. 
Two-dimensional integrals are reduced further to one dimension by integrating through 
the polar angle.  
In order to solve the problem of the two-dimensional bubble computationally, firstly 
the surface is represented by n points which divide the surface into (

 elements, 
each being the frustum of a cone. Then an isoparametric linear approximation is used 
for the surface shape, potential and its normal derivative. Thus on each segment,

approximating function

bubble because of axisymmetry. For the end point, C, it belongs not only to the bubble 
surface, but also to the rigid boundary of the plate. Since the interface cannot 
completely detach from the plate and there is no flow through the plate, C can only 
move along the plate so that the boundary condition

3.3.5 Non-dimensionalisation  
We use the initial velocity, Ui, as a reference velocity and the orifice radius, 
or , as the 
reference length. Time is rendered dimensionless with respect to the fundamental 
timescale, 
/
o
i
r
U . Thus, the initial condition is that the bubble is a hemisphere with 
unit dimensionless radius and unit dimensionless velocity.  
With respect to velocity potential, the initial conditions become

In developing the numerical solution of these equations, it is convenient to scale all 
terms to obtain dimensionless equations. We choose the Froude number, Fr, Weber 
number, We, Volume number, Vn, and Orifice number, On, to represent the physical 
and geometrical scales in our bubbling system, where:

time, an iterative trapezium rule, Euler’s Method, is used

 and  ,i z

 are radial velocity and axial velocity at 
thi  point of the bubble 
surface respectively. 
When one of the radial distances of the points (except the top point) on the bubble 
surface becomes zero, the detachment of the bubble happens and the computational 
procedure is ended.  
The procedure is summarized in the following steps: 
(i) 
Initialize all variables. 
(ii) 
Increment time by ∆t. 
(iii) 
The field Equation (3.58) is solved using the Boundary Integral Method. Using 
the Green’s formula approach the normal velocity is found directly by solving 
Equation (3.82) numerically. The tangential velocity is solved by cubic spline 
interpolation. 
(iv) 
Use the velocities found in (iii) to update the position of the surfaces. 
(v) 
Use the dynamic condition, Equation (3.86), to update the surface potentials. 
(vi) 
Go back to (ii) and repeat until detachment happens. 
3.4 Improvements over Hooper’s (1986) model 
The proposed model is generally based on Hooper’s (1986) approach to modeling 
bubble formation using the boundary integral method. However, we have made several 
significant improvements and developments in our model. 
Firstly, the selection of dimensionless numbers representing the physical and 

Chapter 3 Improved modeling of bubble formation with the boundary integral method 
 
74
dimensional parameters allows the natural and a priori formulation of the 
dimensionless equation of potential flow (Equation 3.86), instead of relying on the 
questionable iterative method to define length and time scales proposed by Hooper 
(1986). 
Secondly, Hooper (1986) does not explicitly account for the curvature of the bubble 
surface in relating Pl to Pb. Instead, it was merely stated that due to numerical 
instabilities, the surface tension number was always set to zero, thereby ignoring the 
effect of σ altogether and rendering Pl equal to Pb in all the solutions. 
Thirdly, the use of a realistic boundary condition (Equation 3.85) at the point where the 
bubble surface meets the orifice plate allows us to relate the bubble shape to the 
dynamic three-phase (i.e. gas-liquid-solid) contact angle, θc, instead of the arbitrary 
shape criterion introduced in Hooper’s (1986) work. 
3.5 Modeling the wall effect on bubble formation 
As discussed in Section 2.6, the effect of the bubble column wall on bubble formation 
has rarely been taken into account by most of the researchers. It has generally been 
assumed that the bubble column was very large compared with the orifice size and that 
the wall effect could be neglected. This assumption is generally valid when the 
container diameter is very large with respect to the bubble diameter. However, as the 
column to orifice diameter ratio is reduced, the bubble behavior is modified: the 
influence of liquid circulation becomes relatively greater and the bubble shape 
becomes longer and, in a limiting case, resembles slugs in vertical pipelines. With the 
consideration of the wall effect, the boundary integral model discussed above is further 
developed by the introduction of a system of images.  

Chapter 3 Improved modeling of bubble formation with the boundary integral method 
 
75
3.5.1 System of images 
To satisfy the no-flux boundary condition on the impermeable column wall where the 
normal velocity is zero, a specific image system is introduced to account for the wall 
effect as shown in Fig. 3.4. For this formulation, Green’s function in Equation (3.84) is 
further modified as:

3.5.2 Bubbling frequency 
One cycle of bubble formation consists of formation and waiting processes. Thus the 
bubble formation period of one cycle is equal to the sum of tf and tw, and the frequency 
of bubble formation, f, which corresponds to the number of bubbles formed per unit 
time, is the inverse number of the period as follows:

The formation time, tf, can be calculated with the model and the waiting time, tw, can 
be calculated from the fact that after bubble detachment, the pressure in the chamber 
will accumulate due to the continuous input of gas but no outflow of gas from the 
chamber. The chamber pressure expression during the waiting time is derived from 
Equation (3.65) under the condition

Chapter 4   Experimental 
 
This chapter gives detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and the procedures 
used for the investigation of the wall effect on bubble formation at a submerged orifice. 
Section 4.1 illustrates the apparatus used in the study, which includes bubble column, 
gas chamber, plate insert and gas supply system. Measurement techniques, consisting 
of dynamic pressure transducer and high-speed video camera, are introduced in 
Section 4.2. Finally, the experimental conditions and procedures are summarized in 
Section 4.3. 
4.1 Experimental apparatus 
Fig. 4.1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus. It consisted of a 
cylinder as the bubble column, a plate insert and a cylinder as the gas chamber. 
Purified air from the compressed gas cylinder was introduced into the gas chamber. 
Air flow rate was controlled by means of three gas flow meters with various ranges. A 
high-speed video camera was used to visually observe bubble formation and a pressure 
transducer was used to record pressure fluctuations in the gas chamber. 
4.1.1 Bubble columns and gas chamber 
The bubble column, designed conveniently for visual and photographical observations, 
was located above the plate insert and gas chamber. The cylindrical bubble column 
was made of 5 mm thickness Plexiglas®. To investigate the effect of column wall on 
bubble formation, three sizes of column,

and

I Dφ 100mm×470mm, were used. The column was open to atmosphere at the top 
and from which water was introduced into the column so that various liquid depths, H, 
could be achieved. A drain valve was designed near the bottom of the column to 
remove the liquid.

water entering the transducer or gas injection lines. The pressure transducer port and

degrees to each other. A drain valve was designed at the bottom of the gas chamber to 
remove the liquid. 
4.1.2 Plate insert 
An interchangeable plate insert allowed various sizes of orifice to be investigated. It 
comprised an orifice plug and a base flange as shown in Fig. 4.2 and Fig. 4.3 
respectively, both of which were made of Perspex.  
The orifice plug consisted of two parts, base and raised section. The base of the orifice 
plug, with diameter 81 mm and height 12 mm, had a central opening with diameter 28 
mm. The raised section, with diameter 30 mm and height 21 mm, was hollow with 
thickness 1mm for the around and top sides and had an orifice in the center of the 
topside. The size of the orifice plug remained constant throughout the experiment, 
however the orifice varied in diameter, 1.6 mm, 2.0 mm and 2.4 mm respectively. With 
the design, the point of injection occurred in a relatively quiescent region so that the 
influence of bulk liquid circulation effects on bubble formation could be reduced. 
Moreover, the raised section enabled bubble formation at the orifice to be clearly 
captured with a high-speed camera.  
The base flange, with diameter 270 mm and height 12 mm, had a central opening with 
diameter 81 mm onto which the orifice plug with specific orifice was inserted. After 
the orifice plug was inserted, the base flange was bolted between the upper bubble 
column and the lower gas chamber.  
In order to achieve an airtight seal, all gaps, such as between the column and the plate 
insert, and between the plate insert and the gas chamber, were sealed tightly by using 
O-rings.

4.1.3 Gas supply system 
The gas supply system consisted of a high-pressure gas cylinder, pressure regulator, 
rotameters and other ancillary apparatus. Purified air from the compressed gas cylinder 
was introduced into the gas chamber. Three rotameters (Tokyo Keiso, Japan), covering 
the range of flow rates 0.08-0.83 cm3/s, 0.5-5.0 cm3/s and 3.3-33 cm3/s respectively, 
were connected in parallel to control the air flowrate into the gas chamber. In order to 
ensure a smooth flow, the upstream pressure maintained at a value was higher than the 
chamber pressure. Therefore, the gas flow rates indicated by the rotameters should be 
converted to standard conditions as shown in Appendix B. The gas temperature was

between 20 and 25oC . 
4.2 Measurement techniques 
4.2.1 Dynamic pressure transducer 
Pressure fluctuations during bubble formation in the gas chamber were recorded by 
Microphone ICP® Pressure Sensor (Model 106B50, PCB PIEZOTRONICS). The 
series 
106B 
microphones 
feature 
high-sensitivity 
(output: 
72.9 
mv/KPa), 
acceleration-compensated quartz pressure elements coupled to built-in integrated 
circuit impedance converting amplifiers. It was designed to measure pressure 
perturbations in air or in fluids in severe conditions.  
The sketch of the pressure transducer is shown in Fig. 4.4. The pressure transducer was 
mounted flush to the chamber wall, and was powered by a signal conditioner (model 
482A06, single channel, PIEZOTRONICS). The analog output from the signal 
conditioner was fed into the computer through a 12-bit ADC (analog digital converter, 
PICO). The ADC-12 converter was connected to the printer port of computer. Its 
measurement range was between 0 and 5 Volt. Collected data was analyzed by a 
driving software installed in the computer. Bubbling frequencies were determined by 
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis of the pressure-time series data. Assuming that 
the size of the bubble is uniform, a single bubble volume was calculated by dividing 
gas flow rate by the obtained bubbling frequency. 
An important consideration in positioning the pressure tapping in the chamber was its 
placement relative to the gas injection port. In order to minimize the effects of the 
supply air blowing directly into the transducer, the pressure tapping was placed at 90

degrees to the injection port.

4.2.2 High-speed video camera 
High-speed images were recorded during the experiments in order to verify the link 
between pressure transducer fluctuations and actual physical dynamics of the system. 
The FASTCAM-PCI High-Speed Video Camera System (PHOTRONTM) was 
employed for this purpose (Fig. 4.5). It comprised of a FASTCAM-PCI camera head, a 
zoom lens and a control PCI board connecting with the computer. The key features of 
the system are 500 full frames recorded at 512 480
×
 resolutions and with a 
maximum recording rate of 10,000 frames per second. Motion analysis software, 
named MotionPlus, was installed in the computer to create image files. 
The camera was placed at the same vertical level as the injection orifice and with 1.0 m 
distances from the bubble column. Two 1000W fan-cooled halogen lamps angled 45 
degrees to the front side of the bubble column illuminated the experimental rig, with a 
white board reflector placed behind the bubble column to get balanced lighting during

picture recording. 
The shutter speed was used to freeze the motion so as to reduce motion blur. By 
controlling the camera shutter speed and exposure time, get a sharp image was 
obtained. The operation of the high speed camera equipment was straightforward and 
film loading, lens focusing and other adjustments of the equipment was verified prior 
to each run according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

4.3.1 Experimental conditions 
The physical properties of air and water are shown in Table 4.1. Table 4.2 lists the 
important parameters for bubble formation, including gas flow rate, orifice diameter, 
column size, liquid height and gas chamber volume, etc. The operating conditions were 
selected to ensure that the independent influence of parameters was being investigated 
as opposed to their combined influence. The primary objectives for the experimental 
work were obtaining the bubbling frequency and bubble volumes under a specified

4.3.2 Experimental procedures 
For each run of experiment, the procedures was as follows: 
1. Insert the orifice plug with specified diameter into the base flange. Choose one 
specific bubble column and attach the bubble column, plate insert and gas 
chamber together by tightening the bolts. Before locating the pressure transducer 
on the port and connecting the gas pipe with the gas chamber, introduce water into 
the gas chamber to achieve a specified gas chamber volume. 
2. Determine if there is leakage of air after tightening the bolts. Open the gas valve 
of the compressed air cylinder and regulate the outlet pressure (i.e. rotameter inlet 
pressure, 0.05 bar overpressure (gauge)). Then the air is fed into the gas chamber 
and fed into the bubble column through the orifice plate.  
3. Introduce the tap water into the bubble column through a rubber hose with a 
predominant gas flow rate. When the water liquid level in the bubble column is 
about to approach to the value to be set, change gas flow rate into a lower value so 
that the liquid surface fluctuation is reduced to get an accurate reading of the 
liquid. If the gas flow rate is too small, weeping is significant and results in an 
unstable liquid level. 
4. Adjust the gas flow rate after the desired liquid level is obtained and the 
experimental data is collected for the specified operating conditions. Care should 
be taken to ensure that the air pressure and gas flow rate are stable during the 
experimental run. 
5. Activate the high-speed video recorder to record bubble behavior. Pressure

fluctuation in the gas chamber is also recorded at the same time and bubble 
frequency and fluctuation amplitude are obtained. 
4.3.3 Reproducibility of experimental data 
In order to confirm the reliability of experimental data, most of the experiments were 
done in triplicate and three runs of experimental data were compared for each 
condition. The experiments were repeated after several days rather than immediately.

In this chapter, first the boundary integral model is validated for single bubbling in 
Section 5.1. Section 5.2 describes the wall effect on bubbling regimes and bubbling 
frequency, experimentally and theoretically. Finally, the discussion for this study is 
presented in Section 5.3. 
  
5.1 Validation of boundary integral model for single bubbling 
The boundary integral model is verified through the comparison of experimental data 
with theoretical predictions for single bubbling. 
For the air-water system of Kupferberg and Jameson (1969) with the following 
experimental conditions:  
Gas flow rate Q = 16.7 cm3/s 
Radius of the orifice ro = 0.16 cm 
Chamber volume Vc = 2250 cm3

5.1(c) compares the simulated bubble growth curve and chamber pressure fluctuation 
with the experimental data.

Fig. 5.3 shows a comparison of the bubble shape traced experimentally from the 
high-speed video images with that calculated by the present model with the following 
experimental conditions: 
Gas flow rate Q = 0.854 cm3/s 
Radius of the orifice ro = 0.12 cm 
Column diameter dc = 10 cm 
Chamber volume Vc = 430 cm3 
Height of the liquid H = 30 cm. 
The experimental bubble shapes are not easy to determine precisely because of 
distortion due to cylindrical column. From visual inspection, it is observed that the 
experimental bubble shapes agree approximately with the predicted bubble shapes by 
the present model shown in Fig. 5.3(b). 
Fig. 5.4 shows the variation of bubble volume at detachment with gas flow rate with 
orifice diameter as a parameter under the conditions of Vc = 430 cm3 and H = 30 cm. 
The bubble volumes calculated by the present model are compared with the results 
obtained experimentally, and a reasonable agreement is observed from the comparison. 
Surface tension is one of the contributing factors influencing the bubble volume. To 
verify the effect of surface tension, data has been collected for liquids of different 
surface tensions, water (σ = 72.7 dyn/cm) and petroleum ether (σ = 27.1 dyn/cm), 
using the same orifice (ro = 0.2 cm) by Davidson and Schüler (1960). Fig. 5.5 shows 
the variation of bubble volume at detachment with gas flow rate for different liquids 
(Davidson and Schüler, 1960, as reported by Ramakrishnan, et al., 1969) and the 
calculated results are compared with the experimental data. It can been seen that at 
lower gas flow rates, surface tension has little effect on the bubble volume, while at

higher flow rates, the lowering of surface tension produces smaller bubbles. It can be 
noted that our model predictions match the experimental trends closely.

5.2 Wall effect 
5.2.1 Wall effect on bubbling regimes 
The wall effect on bubble formation was investigated by carrying out experiments with 
different column sizes. Figure 5.6(a to c) shows the video sequences of bubble 
formation for various column diameters of 100 mm, 50 mm, and 30 mm respectively. 
The other parameters have been kept constant for these three sets of experiments as 
follows: gas flow rate 
0.854
Q =

430
c
V =
cm3, the orifice 
diameter 
2.4
o
d =
mm and the liquid height 
30
H =
cm.  
It was observed that for the largest column with diameter 
100
cd =
mm, only one 
single bubble was formed for each cycle and when the bubble detached, the process 
entered into the waiting period till the next cycle starts, i.e. this is clearly a case of 
single bubbling. When 
50
cd =
mm, it was found that when the first bubble detached, a 
smaller second bubble was formed immediately and the second bubble caught up to 
and coalesced with the first one. After the second bubble detached, the process entered 
into the waiting period till the next cycle started; we can classify this as pairing. When 
30
cd =
mm, it was found that when the first bubble detached, a smaller second bubble 
was formed immediately and when the second detached, a smaller third bubble was 
formed immediately and the second and third bubbles caught up to and coalesced with 
the first one. After the third bubble detached, the process entered into the waiting 
period till the next cycle started; this was a case of multiple bubbling. 
From the above observation, it is clear that the relative dimensions of the column and 
the orifice has a significant and profound effect on the bubbling regime.

It was observed from Fig. 5.7 (a) that for

the waiting period till the next cycle started. Compared with the case of single 
bubbling with chamber volume 
430
c
V =
cm3 (Fig. 5.6(a)), the larger chamber volume 
has clearly shifted the bubble formation into the pairing regime. For 
50
cd =
mm and 
30 mm, the bubble formation for 
1000
c
V =
cm3 was clearly within the multiple 
bubbling regime, i.e. three or more bubbles were formed in rapid succession during 
each bubbling cycle.  
The results show that with an increase of the chamber volume, the regime of the 
bubble formation will shift towards pairing and multiple bubbling. This observation is 
consistent with McCann and Prince’s (1971) conclusion that pairing and multiple 
bubbling were more likely to occur in the case of large chamber volumes.

A typical set of the chamber pressure signals and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 
analysis of the pressure signals for various column diameters of 100 mm, 50 mm, and 
30 mm are shown in Figures 5.8 and 5.9 respectively. The other parameters are kept 
constant for these three sizes of column as follows: gas flow rate

There are other factors affecting bubbling frequency, such as chamber volume and gas 
flow rate. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the wall effect on bubbling 
frequency with the consideration of those factors, a series of experiments were carried 
out by changing the experimental conditions of chamber volume and gas flow rate.  
The validity of our theoretical model was investigated by comparing simulated results 
of bubbling frequency with a wide range of experimental data for various column and 
orifice diameters, chamber volumes and gas flow rates.  
Fig. 5.10(a) shows the relationship between bubbling frequency and gas flow rate for 
three sizes of column with orifice diameter 
1.6

d =
mm and chamber volume

c
V =
cm3. The comparisons of experimental results with theoretical predictions are 
also shown in this figure. When orifice diameters are changed to 2.0 mm and 2.4 mm, 
the corresponding relationships are shown in Figs. 5.10(b) and 5.10(c) respectively. It 
is observed that bubbling frequency increases with an increase of the gas flow rate and 
also column diameter, whereas bubbling frequency decreases with increasing orifice 
diameter. Our theoretical model predicts these trends very well, and the agreement 
between simulated and experimental frequencies is good. 
The corresponding bubbling frequencies for 
1000
c
V =
cm3 are shown in Figs. 5.11(a), 
(b) and (c) for orifice diameters, 1.6 mm, 2.0 mm and 2.4 mm respectively. The 
experimental trends are similar to those in Fig. 5.10, and again there is good agreement 
between theoretical predictions and experimental data.

5.3 Discussion 
The theoretical model developed with the boundary integral method has been validated 
for single bubbling through the comparison of experimental results with theoretical 
predictions. The model predicts the instantaneous bubble shape, detachment time as 
well as the chamber and bubble pressure. In addition, the wall effect on bubble 
formation was investigated experimentally and theoretically. As the ratio of the column 
diameter to orifice diameter is decreased, the bubbling regimes generally transition 
from single bubbling to pairing and multiple bubbling, with a corresponding decrease 
in bubbling frequency. It is due to the fact that with the decrease of the ratio of column 
to orifice diameter, the liquid circulation increases which affects bubble formation, and 
the detachment happens earlier resulting in smaller bubble volume. Comparison of 
experimental results for bubbling frequency with the theoretical predictions shows that 
the agreement is good, i.e. the boundary integral model successfully predicts the effect 
of the column wall on bubbling frequency.  
However, this model does not take into account the bubble-bubble interaction caused 
by preceding detached bubble. Also this model has the limitation of not being able to 
predict the occurrence of pairing and multiple bubbling. Hence, to understand 
thoroughly the underlying mechanism and take into consideration of the wake effect 
caused by the preceding bubble as well as the bubble-wall interaction, a simplified 
model based on spherical bubble formation and potential flow theory is proposed in 
Chapter 6.

In this chapter, the development and the solution strategy for the theoretical modeling 
of bubble-wall and bubble-bubble interactions are described in Section 6.1 and Section 
6.2 respectively. Results and conclusions obtained from this study are presented in 
Section 6.3 and Section 6.4, respectively. 
 
6.1 Model development 
6.1.1 Physical system and basic assumptions 
The schematic diagram of the physical system is shown in Fig. 6.1 and the primary 
assumptions of the model are:  
(i). 
The bubble shape is a spheroidal segment during formation and deforms into a 
spherical-cap bubble after detachment.  
(ii). 
The depth of liquid above the plate is high enough compared with the bubble 
diameter so that it has no effect on bubble formation.  
(iii). 
The gas is an ideal and compressible gas following an adiabatic process.  
(iv). 
A detached and rising bubble is assumed to exert a wake pressure on the 
subsequent bubble forming at the orifice. However, a following bubble has no 
effect on velocity or shape of the preceding bubble.   
(v). 
There is no energy exchange or mass transfer across the gas-liquid interface.

(vi). 
At a particular instant, the orifice experiences either upward gas flow (referred 
to as bubbling) or no flow (referred to as waiting). At any instant, the orifice 
only shows one of the above phases.

6.1.2 Analysis of the gas chamber pressure 
The change of pressure in the gas chamber, 
cP , is obtained by assuming an adiabatic 
ideal gas and applying first law of thermodynamics to the gas chamber (Tan and Harris, 
1986):

6.1.3 Orifice equation  
Gas flow through the orifice is determined by its physical dimensions and the pressure 
difference between the gas chamber and the bubble. As the upward gas momentum has 
been neglected, the volumetric gas flow rate and the pressure drop across orifice can be 
related according to the following equation:

6.1.4 Liquid pressure analysis  
The viscosity of the liquid is assumed negligible and the flow is assumed to be 
irrotational. Therefore, the potential flow theory can be used to describe the process. 
Since the bubble is assumed to be spherical, a moving spherical coordinate system is 
used, with the origin located at the centre of the growing and translating bubble as 
shown in Fig. 6.2.

P  is the wake pressure imposed by the preceding bubble, which is discussed 
below. 
6.1.6 Wake pressure analysis  
The pressure field in the wake of a detached rising bubble will affect the growth of the 
next bubble. When the bubble detaches, a tongue of liquid moves upward into the rear 
of the bubble, so that the bubble immediately begins to deform towards a spherical-cap 
bubble and attains its terminal velocity (Clift et al., 1978). With Oseen’s modification 
to potential flow, the wake pressure, caused by the detached rising bubble with steady 
velocity at the orifice, can be written as follows (Mittoni, 1997; Zhang and Tan, 2000):

The value 11/16 is the added mass coefficient of a sphere in the vicinity of a plane wall 
(Milne-Thomson, 1968).  
6.1.8 Bubble detachment criteria  
With the growth and translation of the bubble, detachment will be possible if the liquid 
pressure at the orifice, 
or
P , becomes greater than the bubble pressure, 
bP , at the 
instant in time when 
a
s =
(i.e. the earliest time for detachment is when the bubble 
base is tangential to the orifice plate). If the orifice pressure, 
or
P , is also greater than 
the chamber pressure, 
cP , weeping is possible after bubble detachment. This situation 

Chapter 6       Theoretical modeling of bubble-wall and bubble-bubble interactions 
 
116
is known as "true single bubbling".  
However, the phenomenon of "pairing" or “multiple bubbling” will be possible if 
c
or
P
P
<
 when 
a
s =
. Immediately after the bubble has detached at the point of 
a
s =
, there is an instantaneous upward pressure drop across the orifice since 
c
or
P
P
>
. 
This pressure difference, 
or
c
P
P −
, will cause a smaller second bubble to grow very 
quickly. When 
a
s =
, the second detaches and it catches up to and coalesces with the 
preceding bubble due to the upward wake pressure. The process repeats till 
cP  is not 
larger than 
or
P  again. It is necessary at this stage to distinguish between “pairing” and 
“multiple bubbling”, although the two are very similar in appearance. One simple 
definition could be used to distinguish them as follows: only two bubbles are formed 
during one cycle of bubble formation for “pairing”, while more than two bubbles are 
formed during one cycle of bubble formation for “multiple bubbling”.   
The criteria for detachment can now be expressed as: the bubble detaches at 
a
s =
; 
“pairing” or “multiple bubbling” happens if 
c
or
P
P
<
 when the bubble has detached, a 
smaller second or third bubble is formed immediately after the preceding detachment; 
the bubble formation period is ended when 
cP  is not larger than 
or
P  and it enters 
into the waiting period of one cycle.  
6.1.9 Chamber pressure during waiting period  
After bubble detachment, the pressure in the chamber will accumulate due to the 
continuous input of gas but no outflow of gas from chamber. The chamber pressure 
expression during waiting time is derived from Equation (6.1) under the condition

where T  is the time from the instant of bubble detachment.  
6.1.10 Bubble frequency f 
One cycle of bubble formation consists of formation time and waiting time. The period 
between the starting point and the detachment point is defined as formation time, tf, 
which can be obtained from the model. The time between the detachment of the one 
cycle of bubble and the growing of the next cycle bubble is defined as the waiting time, 
tw, which can be obtained from Equation (6.17). Thus the bubble formation period 
equals to the sum of tf and tw. The frequency of bubble formation, f, which corresponds 
to the number of bubble formed per unit time, is the inverse number of the period as 
follows

The simulations were carried out for a chain of bubbles. The initial bubble was allowed 
to form in a quiescent liquid, i.e., it experienced no wake effect. Each subsequent 
bubble was then simulated as forming, detaching and rising under the influence of the 
wake pressure of its immediate predecessor. In most cases, straightforward 
convergence was attained at the third cycle of bubble formation, i.e., the second and 
the third cycle of bubble formation were virtually identical. The converged values of 
waiting time, and formation time then constitute one bubbling cycle. 
 
6.3 Results and discussion 
6.3.1 Theoretical simulation of bubbling regimes 
The chamber pressure fluctuations during one cycle of bubble formation, which were 
predicted by the present model, are shown in Figs. 6.3 (a) to 6.3 (c) for various column 
diameters of 100 mm, 50 mm and 30 mm respectively with the following conditions:

It was observed that for each bubbling cycle, the chamber pressures increased briefly 
at the beginning of bubble formation, as a result of gas flow rate entering the chamber 
being higher than the gas flow rate through the orifice, shown as the inset I in each 
figure. Fig. 6.3(a) shows that after the short duration of pressure increase, the gas 
chamber pressure decreased until the lowest point A, at which the bubble detached 
from the orifice. After the bubble detachment, the chamber pressure increased linearly 
until the chamber pressure was high enough to initiate the next cycle of bubbling, 
which belongs to the waiting period. This is clearly a single bubbling regime.  
Fig. 6.3(b) shows that with the bubble formation, the chamber decreased until point B, 
at which 
a
s =
 and the bubble detached at this point. Because of the higher chamber 
pressure than the orifice pressure at point A, a second bubble was formed immediately. 
After the first bubble detachment, there was also a short-term pressure increase as 
shown in inset II, after which the chamber pressure decreased again until the lowest

point A, and the second bubble detached from the orifice at this point. After that, it 
enters into the waiting period until the next bubbling cycle happens, and this is a 
regime of pairing. 
Fig. 6.3(c) shows that with the bubble formation, the chamber decreased until point B, 
at which 
a
s =
 and the bubble detached at this point. Because of the higher chamber 
pressure than the orifice pressure at point A, a second bubble was formed immediately. 
After the first bubble detachment, there was also a short-term pressure increase shown 
as the inset II, after which the chamber pressure decreased again until the point C 
where 
a
s =
, and the second bubble detached from the orifice at this point. Because 
the chamber pressure was still higher than the orifice pressure at point A, a third 
bubble was formed immediately. After the second bubble detachment, there was also a 
short-term pressure increase shown as the inset III, after which the chamber pressure 
decreased again until the point A, and the third bubble detached at this point. After that, 
it entered into the waiting period until the next bubbling cycle happens, and this is 
classified as multiple bubbling. 
Wake pressure induced by detached rising was taken into account in this model. Wake 
pressure behind the rising bubble plays a significant role in determining bubble-bubble 
interaction, and the rotational motion in the liquid induced by the wake tends to detach 
the forming bubble earlier resulting in the transition of the bubbling regimes. It can be 
noted from the observation that our model can simulate the occurrence of the different 
bubbling regimes.

6.3.2 Comparison of experimental results with theoretical predictions  
The validity of our theoretical model was investigated by comparing simulated results 
of bubbling frequency with a wide range of experimental data for various column and 
orifice diameters, chamber volumes and gas flow rates.  
Fig. 6.4(a) shows the relationship between bubbling frequency and gas flow rate for 
three sizes of column with orifice diameter, 
1.6
o
d =
mm, and chamber volume, 
430
c
V =
cm3. It is observed that with the increase of the gas flow rate, the bubbling 
frequency increases, which is consistent with the observation in Snabre and 
Magnifotcham (1998). The comparisons between experimental results with theoretical 
predictions are also shown in this figure. When orifice diameters were changed to 2.0 
mm and 2.4 mm, the corresponding relationships are shown in Figs. 6.4(b) and 6.4(c) 
respectively. The experimental trends are very clear: bubbling frequency increased 
with increasing column diameter and also with increasing gas flow rate, whereas 
bubbling frequency decreased with increasing orifice diameter. The simplified 
spherical growth model predicts these trends as well as the boundary integral model, 
and the agreement between simulated and experimental frequencies is very good. 
The corresponding bubbling frequencies for 
1000
c
V =
cm3 are shown in Figs. 6.5(a), 
(b) and (c) for orifice diameters, 1.6 mm, 2.0 mm and 2.4 mm, respectively. The 
experimental trends are similar to those in Fig. 6.4, and again there is good agreement 
between theoretical predictions and experimental data.

6.3.3 Bubbling regime map  
There are three bubbling regimes, single bubbling, pairing and multiple bubbling, 
which are determined by the ratio of the column diameter to the orifice diameter and 
gas flow rate. The experimental and theoretical regime maps are shown in Figs. 6.6(a) 
and (b) for chamber volume 
430
c
V =
cm3 and 1000 cm3 respectively with gas 
flowrate and diameter ratio (
/
c
o
d
d ) as the parameters. Fig. 6.6 shows boundaries 
between the three bubbling regimes described earlier, viz., single bubbling, pairing and 
multiple bubbling regimes. It was observed that with the decrease of diameter ratio or 
increase of the gas flow rate, the bubbling regimes generally transition from single 
bubbling to pairing and multiple bubbling, and the theoretical regime boundaries were 
in good agreement with the experimental regime boundaries. For the larger chamber 
volume, the theoretical boundaries between adjacent regimes are shifted upwards 
significantly, in accord with our experimental findings. This is consistent with 
McCann and Prince’s (1971) observation that pairing and doubling bubbling are more 
likely to occur in a large chamber volume. 
At very low gas flowrates, below ~0.25 cm3/s, the wall effect disappears, since single 
bubbling occurs for all values of 
/
c
o
d
d . The bubble frequency (and hence bubble 
volume) is also independent of 
/
c
o
d
d , as can be seen in Figs. 6.4 and 6.5. It appears 
that bubble-bubble interactions are negligible at low bubbling frequencies (less than ~1 
s-1).

6.4 Conclusions  
A spherical bubble formation model, which takes into account the wake effect as well 
as the wall effect, has been developed using potential flow theory. Our investigation 
demonstrates that the bubble-wall and bubble-bubble interactions can have profound 
influence on bubbling frequencies and bubbling regimes in bubble formation at a 
submerged orifice. These effects have been successfully modelled by potential flow 
and bubble wake pressure analysis. Also, the occurrence of bubbling regimes could be 
predicted with this model.

Chapter 7   Conclusions and recommendations 
 
The mechanics of bubble formation has been investigated in the present study. In this 
chapter, the conclusions obtained from this study and the recommendations for further 
study are presented.  
 
7.1 Conclusions 
7.1.1 Conclusions on bubble formation in a quiescent liquid 
This study attempted to study the mechanics of bubble formation in a quiescent liquid 
theoretically and an improved theoretical model was developed using the boundary 
integral method. The results, including the instantaneous shapes, detachment time, 
liquid circulation as well as the bubble and chamber pressure, obtained with this model 
were in substantial agreement with those data from reported experimental data. This 
shows that the model can predict the process of bubble formation very well. 
Improvements and contributions from this research are summarized as follows: 
1. The selection of dimensionless numbers representing the physical and dimensional 
parameters allows the natural and a priori formulation of the dimensionless 
equation of potential flow, instead of relying on the questionable iterative method 
to define length and time scales. 
2. The effect of the surface tension is included in the model. 
3. The use of a realistic boundary condition at the point where the bubble surface

130
meets the orifice plate allows us to relate the bubble shape to the dynamic 
three-phase (i.e. gas-liquid-solid) contact angle, instead of the arbitrary shape 
criterion. 
7.1.2 Conclusions on bubble formation with wall effect 
This research attempted to assess the wall effect on bubble formation both 
experimentally and theoretically.  
In the experiment, three different bubbling regimes were observed and analyzed by 
means of high-speed video camera and dynamic pressure transducer. The effects of the 
chamber volume, gas flow rate and orifice diameter were also studied. 
The following summarizes the conclusions obtained from the experimental results: 
1. There are three bubbling regimes, single bubbling, pairing and multiple bubbling, 
for bubble formation which are affected by the column diameter. 
2. With the decrease of the diameter ratio or increase of the gas flow rate, the 
bubbling regimes generally transition from single bubbling to pairing and multiple 
bubbling, with a corresponding decrease in bubbling frequency. 
3. Pairing and multiple bubbling are more likely to occur with large chamber volume 
and gas flow rate. For the larger chamber volume, the boundaries between adjacent 
regimes are shifted upwards significantly. 
4. Orifice diameter has an effect on bubble formation. With an increase of the orifice 
diameter, the bubble volume is increased with a corresponding decrease in 
bubbling frequency. 
To investigate the wall effect theoretically, a model was developed using the boundary 

Chapter 7                                 Conclusions and recommendations 
 
131
integral method with the introduction of a specific system of images. Comparison of 
experimental results for bubbling frequency with the theoretical predictions shows that 
the agreement is very good, i.e. the model successfully predicts the effect of the 
column wall on bubbling frequency.  
In addition, to take into consideration the interaction between the column wall and the 
growing bubble at the orifice, as well as the interaction between subsequent bubbles 
formed and detached from the orifice, a theoretical spherical model for bubble 
formation was developed using potential flow theory. Our investigation demonstrates 
that the bubble-wall and bubble-bubble interactions can have profound influence on 
bubbling frequencies and bubbling regimes in bubble formation at a submerged orifice. 
These effects have been successfully modelled by potential flow and bubble wake 
pressure analysis, and the occurrence of the bubbling regime can be predicted with the 
spherical model. Simulated results using the theoretical model agreed very well with 
experimental data. 
7.1.3 Contributions 
The contributions of this research are summarized as follows: 
1. The boundary integral method model initially developed by Hooper (1986) was 
improved significantly. 
2. The wall effect on bubbling frequency and bubbling regime was investigated 
extensively. 
3. For the non-spherical modeling, the boundary integral method and system of 
images were used to predict the bubbling frequency. The spherical model 
developed by Zhang and Tan (2000) was developed with the consideration of wall

132
effect on bubble formation, and the bubbling frequency and bubbling regime can 
be predicted with this improved model. 
 
7.2 Recommendations for further study 
In this section, recommendations for further study are given as follows: 
1. In the problems discussed so far, the gas is not soluble in liquid or it does not react 
with the liquid. However, bubble formation with chemical reaction has many 
applications in physical and chemical processes and it is such a case that we should 
address, especially in the environmental field in which pollution is a serious 
problem. Thus, it is essential to study bubble formation with mass transfer and 
chemical reaction both experimentally and theoretically. Several workers have 
studied mass transfer from the surface of a growing bubble at a gas distribution. 
Burman and Jameson (1976) proposed mass transfer equations during bubble 
formation. Stangle and Mahaling (1989) developed a spherical model to estimate 
the gas absorption rate during bubble formation. Terasaka et al. (1999) conducted 
experiments to measure the absorption rate from pure SO2 gas bubbles to water. A 
pseudo-spherical model for the SO2-water system was proposed. In their model, 
mass transfer from the gas-liquid interface during bubble growth was described by 
the penetration theory. They applied spherical equations of motion and spherical 
gas stream function to describe the bubble growth. Therefore, further study of 
bubble formation should be extended to these cases. 
2. What has been discussed so far is the mechanics of bubble formation under single 
orifice. However, bubble formation with multiple orifices is widely used and 
encountered in practice. Xie and Tan (2003) investigated the bubble formation at 

Chapter 7                                 Conclusions and recommendations 
 
133
multiple orifice and regimes of synchronous, alternative and unsteady bubbling 
were clearly identified in their work. A theoretical model for predicting 
synchronous bubbling frequency was also developed in Xie and Tan (2003). 
Therefore, extending the present model to describe the process of multiple-orifice 
bubble formation is recommended for future research. 
3. Liquid viscosity is one of the factors affecting bubble formation. Zhang and Tan 
(2005) developed a model for the prediction of bubble formation in viscous liquid. 
In Zhang and Tan (2005), the interfacial element method was applied to calculate 
to bubble shape and detachment, and drag force due to the viscous drag was 
incorporated in force balance to take into account of the viscosity effect. To 
investigate the bubble formation more thoroughly, further experimental and 
theoretical study of bubble formation should been carried out with the 
consideration of the effect of the liquid viscosity.

In most cases we will want to evaluate the integral on a more general interval, say 
[ , ]
a b . We will use the variable x  on this more general interval, and linearly map the 
[ , ]
a b
 interval for 
x  onto the [ 1, 1]
−+
 interval for t  using the linear 
transformation:

where 
it  is a designated evaluation point, 
iw  is the weight of that point in the sum 
and n  is the number of the points at which the function 
( )
f t  is evaluated. The 
values of 
it  and 
iw  are uniquely determined for any given value of n  and are 
tabulated in the literature. When n  is chosen as 8, the values of 
it  and 
iw  are listed 
in the Table A.2.

The flow meters used had the scale readings calibrated by the manufacturer for a 
standard condition of air density 1.293 kg/m3, temperature of 20 oC and pressure of 1 
atm (absolute). The formula given below for volumetric flow rate correction for 
different densities, temperature and pressure is:
