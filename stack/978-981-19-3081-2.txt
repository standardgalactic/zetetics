Preface: From Adolescence to Maturity 
and the Data Revolution in Our Era 
A New Way to Divide Data 
With the rise of big data, the power of data is often discussed, but the problem is that 
the data referred to is not always the same kind of data. 
Nowadays, everything that is recorded is referred to as data, and that extends to 
written language. The logic underlying this is that data has become a concept. In the 
traditional sense of the term, data referred to the results gained by measuring physical 
things. What can be quantiﬁed can be turned into data. This could be called numerical 
data. However, “data” is now applied to images, video, and audio recordings— 
not things being quantiﬁed by measurements but recorded from the surrounding 
environment. This data is a type of evidence or record of events. What can be recorded 
can be turned into data. This could also be called recording data. 
Numerical data and recording data were originally completely unrelated items, 
but they have been united by the fact that they can now both be stored as bits and 
bytes on a computer. When we talk about big data, I think the most precise way to 
sum it up is with this equation: 
Big data = traditional numerical data (a quantiﬁable piece of data derived from 
measurement, like an exterior temperature of 28 °C) + modern recording data 
(produced by capturing the world around us, like a digital image). 
Numerical data is closer to the original concept of data as a number, but, looking 
back over history, it was recording data that appeared ﬁrst. Our earliest attempts to 
record history are an example of this latter type of data. Recording data is like a 
shadow cast by history. Numerical data came along later, produced by things like 
recording changes in the sky, the movement of stars, the location of mountains, or 
the course of rivers. This precision was gradually extended to many other things. The 
origin of science is trying to record data about physical things. Numerical data is the 
mother of science, you could say. It is based on precision. 
Around the sixteenth century, when human beings embarked on a new age of 
exploration, there was a new wave of numerical data produced by the popularization 
of navigational instruments and the spread of similar inventions in the ﬁelds of land

surveying, architecture, design, mining, and demographics developed. We discovered 
that quantitative data could provide solutions for science and management that were 
not possible with merely qualitative descriptions. The ﬁrst wave of data was a wave 
of numerical data. 
This was the dawn of humanity’s ﬁrst data spring. 
In the twentieth century, there was an explosion of data following the spread of 
computers, the Internet, and smartphones. In terms of magnitude, this blew away 
what was seen in the sixteenth century. Judging by volume, the vast majority of 
big data is now recording data. It is data produced by the spread of technologies to 
record the world around us. This is what is meant by universal recording. If we look 
at Internet platforms, most of the data they host is recording data. 
The previous 5,000 years of our civilization seem impressive compared to our 
comparatively brief modern age. But the present state of universal recording means 
that we know much more about it than we do in the past. Even if we have libraries 
full of history books, they tend to focus on the deeds of emperors and generals. 
Looking for more individualized records of people from behind that small coterie 
of great men, we ﬁnd comparatively few. Universal recording changes that. In the 
future, there will not only be histories of states or societies or industries, but also 
an unprecedented number of personal histories. Historians of later ages will have an 
immense amount of material to study. 
Of course, numerical data has things to tell us about Chinese history, as we saw 
with the discussion sparked by Ray Huang’s ideas on “numerical management.” I 
focused on numerical data in my previous two books, Big Data and The Peaks of 
Data.1 The latter was intended as a continuation of Ray Huang’s work. But this book 
focuses more on recording data. 
An Unﬁnished Revolution 
The Big Data Fever we see today is about a speciﬁc type of data: recording data. It 
has nothing to do with numerical data. 
There’s nothing strange about the interest in recording data. It can be explained 
by the changes that the Internet has brought to society and the fortunes that have 
been built from it. If we look at e-commerce, social networking, or media platforms, 
they have all beneﬁted from recording data. 
Almost all human behaviors can be recorded and converted into data. If the core 
of numerical data is accuracy, then the core of recording data is clarity. 
The popularity of smartphones has made data ubiquitous, but most of us have 
only a superﬁcial understanding of it. The discussion of the topic is mostly restricted 
to precision marketing, ﬁnancial and social credit, and privacy.
1 Editor’s note: The simpliﬁed Chinese version of The Peaks of Data was released by CITIC 
Publishing Group in May of 2014.

Precision marketing refers to Internet advertising. Compared to traditional 
marketing, online platforms can now push personalized advertisements to users based 
on the data that they generate. Using consumer data for advertising greatly improves 
the efﬁciency of marketing. This has driven the commercial big data revolution. 
Whether we are talking about the Chinese BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) or 
Facebook, Amazon, and Google. 
When it comes to data for credit purposes, the main users of the technology are 
ﬁnancial institutions. This is another way that Internet companies can wring proﬁts 
out of big data. It is also the reason why we have seen so many Internet companies 
entering the ﬁnancial ﬁeld. The business model is to use big data to assess customers 
through their purchase records; ﬁnancial products are offered to customers based 
on what the company can learn from data analysis. Alibaba’s Sesame Credit and 
Tencent WeBank’s microloans are offered on the basis of credit scores. 
Both precision marketing and credit scoring require monitoring customers and 
collecting data on their behavior. Individual users become the target of observation, 
analysis, and surveillance. This brings us to the third area of discussion: privacy. 
Now that Internet companies are collecting more data, we also hear more about that 
information being lost in privacy breaches. Tragedies have resulted from this. 
Recently, a friend told me that he had received targeted advertising on Toutiao 
for swimsuits and goggles. They somehow knew that he had gone swimming. The 
only way that was possible, he decided, was that he had used his smart watch’s “pool 
mode.” 
It seems clear this speculation was correct. Toutiao must have accessed the data 
from his watch. There is ambivalence about this sort of business model. On the one 
hand, we feel as if our rights have been violated, or at least disrespected. We might 
feel betrayed. Public opinion usually expresses dissatisfaction toward this business 
model in black-and-white terms and evaluates this kind of practice as unfair. But on 
the other hand, if he really needed goggles, it’s quite an efﬁcient system. 
These two business models are feasible because they use recording data to under-
stand consumer dynamics. The value of recording data to commercial and manage-
ment spheres is the focus of this book. However, for the sake of convenience, I will 
not refer to “recording data” but simply “data.” 
This is big data as the public sees it. The ﬁrst two concerns—precision marketing 
and credit—have popped up in public opinion, leading us to the third issue of privacy, 
but this is only the tip of the iceberg. Can the discussion really be conﬁned to the rise 
of several large ﬁrms, improving efﬁciency, and rectifying the credit system? Is it so 
simple to get rid of the inconveniences and push for the positive use of technology? 
I think we need to go deeper. 
In the business world, big data is still subject to ongoing reforms; Internet appli-
cations are constantly updated and revamped. Big data is not being used to its full 
potential yet, but when it is, we will see a ﬁnal form that allows complete automation 
of most commercial processes—that is, intelligent business. Commercial civilization 
will be completely recreated and reshaped by this process. That is what I hope to 
explain in this book.

Preface: From Adolescence to Maturity and the Data Revolution in Our Era
The commercialization of recording data has led to the rise of big data, but business 
is only one angle from which to look at this problem. This big data revolution will 
be socialized. We will someday see smart business, but it relies on data, too. The 
great changes in social governance and individual lives will have an impact on all 
aspects of social life. This will push us toward an entirely new civilization and remake 
society. This is a story that might be told the same way in many parts of the world. 
We need to put aside the discussion of the details and zoom out to get a look at the 
direction things are going. The power of data will reshape society and maybe even 
human nature. 
I call this Data Civilization. That is the theme of this book. 
A New Civilization Rising 
What is the meaning of “civilization”? Civilization is the gathered sediment of the 
ﬂows of history. It includes the inventions and innovations that have stood the test 
of public opinion over time. It gathers together these essential elements: spoken and 
written languages, tools and instruments, morality and ethics, beliefs and religious 
practices, laws, family systems, the polis, and the nation state. 
Our present written language is also a type of data, or we could say that data also 
includes but surpasses written language. The written word is only a subset of data. 
We could make this analogy: the written word is to data as gold is to metal. 
Language once shaped human civilization but data has taken its place. It has the 
power to shape psychology, ethics, and even religious beliefs. I hope this book will 
explain that. 
The Chinese word for civilization is wenming, which combines the characters for 
“language” or “culture” with the character for “understanding” or “light.” Humanity 
has always been grasping for that “light.” Confucius said: “If I could know how to 
realize my ideal in the morning, I would gladly accept my death in the evening.” In 
other words, if someone arrives at a revelation about the truth, they can die happily. 
Death is a price one should be willing to pay for the truth. In Chinese, all of these words 
contain the “light” of civilization: wisdom—mingzhi—virtue—mingde—reason— 
mingli—and when we say a person is sensible, they are mingbai. Finding this “light” 
is the quest of humankind. The “light” of civilization illuminates all things. It is 
the prerequisite for all material existence and development. When we rise above 
the primitive state of subsistence, we call this civilization. As the Chinese word— 
wenming—suggests, it is “language” that brings us to the “light.” 
Now, we can go beyond “language” as a source of this “light.” Data casts its own 
illumination. Some things that were historically hidden or obscured have become 
apparent because of the light of data. New knowledge has become clear. This allows 
us to put it to use. Humanity has never understood or managed itself with as much 
deﬁnition, clarity, precision, or objectivity as at present. This is because of data. Data 
allows us to uncover many facts that were unknown. The idea of trusting things to

luck in an uncertain world will come to an end. We are entering a more civilized and 
safe era. 
There is a story in the Bible that says people in every part of the world used to 
speak the same language. It was easy for everyone to communicate and cooperate. 
That led the people of the Earth to pool their talents together and attempt to build a 
tower to heaven. Humankind united for the project and the tower grew higher and 
higher, until God grew anxious. He saw that their project was only possible because 
they spoke the same language. 
Construction of the tower was halted when God suddenly gave each group of 
people their own language. From that moment on, mankind was divided and unable 
to cooperate effectively. The Tower of Babel failed. The people scattered. 
Whether we are talking about numerical data or recording data, it is all uniﬁed 
under the 1s and 0s of binary computer language. According to the logic of the Bible, 
we could unite to build our tower to Heaven. 
There will be even greater changes on the social and national levels. More indi-
vidual behavior is being recorded, which gives states the power to track citizens, 
vehicles, and other things. If a well-developed bureaucracy can master the use of 
data, it will have an increasingly deﬁned image of the societies they govern. Data 
creates a high deﬁnition society, and this book argues that effective governance can 
only come through being able to see with clarity. 
My work builds on Ray Huang’s ideas about “numerical management.” I believe 
that China’s relative backwardness over the past century was the result of many 
people forsaking precision. There was a lack of numerical data in Chinese history. 
When compared to numerical data, recording data gives the state even more 
tools and methods for governance. The best way to modernize governance is by 
using big data. I believe, when we’re talking about China, that the only route to the 
modernization of governance is big data. 
In Chinese history, there was always a debate about the rule of virtue versus rule of 
law. Rule of virtue is based on love for one’s fellow man, while rule of law advocates 
for a strict legal code. This debate has been raging for the past thousand years. It’s 
clear that China now wants to establish a society based on rule of law. But this book 
proposes something in addition to that: rule of data, or data governance. Rule of data 
means the efﬁcient collection, use, and analysis of data to govern the country. It is 
also referring to the way in which data itself can be governed. Effective management 
of data for the effective management of the state will be an important component of 
governance. 
Big data in the context of the Internet represents a new force in national affairs 
and it is changing traditional society. We can look at the example of the spread of 
surveillance cameras, which can capture and replay events that would previously 
have gone unnoticed. The idea of trusting things to luck has its limits now. The 
crime rate will go down. Data governance addresses a fundamental human need for 
security. 
But data and the Internet bring new challenges, as well. It is difﬁcult for state 
power to be projected into every dark corner of the Internet. Now, more functions of 
the state are being transferred to private companies and civil society organizations.

Preface: From Adolescence to Maturity and the Data Revolution in Our Era
While you would have once found the information in a more roundabout way, the 
reputation of a business can now be found by reading customer reviews. If you see a 
news report about a disaster and want to make a donation, you will probably go to an 
online platform instead of directly to a traditional charity. A government department 
can launch a website for its services, but the real revolution in public service has come 
from integrating services into commercial Internet platforms. The media provides 
more examples. Toutiao has supplanted TV stations and newspapers as a source of 
information. But that means that private ﬁrms can now challenge the government 
in the realm of public opinion. How do we restore the credibility of state power? It 
seems that integration with private Internet companies is the only solution. 
How do we use the power of big data and the Internet and also restrain it when 
necessary? Data governance will give birth to a new political civilization. That is the 
challenge we face. If data governance is done well, China will have a great advantage 
in a new era. That holds true for the central government, as well as subnational 
governments and companies. 
A Reliable Road to Success 
Data civilization has meaning not only for states and societies but also for the 
individual. 
Individuals need to grasp where the future is headed and what that will mean. They 
need to know what sorts of businesses will disappear and be born in their lifetimes. 
We can’t allow people to stumble forward in the dark. If we want people to rush into 
the future and appreciate the scenery along the way, they need a light. 
I believe that data civilization will mean that the potential of individuals will 
increase. The type of person that will succeed in a data civilization will have aware-
ness and understanding of data and the talent to make use of it. A new era of data 
civilization will shape the destiny of individuals. We should adjust our ways of 
thinking. 
When I was a kid, I remember hearing stories that would usually begin something 
like this, “A long time ago, far away, on the other side of the mountains...” I was 
fascinated by that description. This is a basic storytelling technique that creates 
a narrative space by distancing the person hearing the story from the events. The 
storyteller is describing a place that the person hearing the story has never been to, 
has never seen, has never experienced, and doesn’t understand. So, the storyteller 
has the authority. In ancient times, it was old people and people that had traveled 
widely that were considered wise. They had seen and experienced times and places 
that most people knew nothing about. 
The reason these places are unknown is because there are no records of them. 
That has changed. There is no longer an unknown place on the other side of the 
mountains. Google Maps and Street View can take you there without having to leave 
home. People are recording their world in all places and at all times. There is no 
limitation set by time and space.

The Tang Dynasty poet Yuan Zhen was a gifted scholar. He wrote some lines of 
love poetry that have been passed down for generations: “All water is forgettable when 
you’ve seen the vast blue sea/No clouds so wondrous as those at Mount Wushan.” He 
was writing those lines to mourn his wife. But the real Yuan Zhen was not quite as 
devoted as his poetic alter ego. Before marrying his wife, he had a lengthy affair with 
his student, which was detailed in Yingying’s Biography, widely considered as the 
forerunner to later Ming and Qing Dynasty works, like A Dream of Red Mansions. 
Yuan Zhen traveled widely and always had affairs. He is reported to have broken 
the hearts of Liu Caichun, a poet from the area around Shanghai, and also Xue 
Tao. The letters that Yuan Zhen and Xue Tao passed back and forth are beloved by 
literary scholars. Xue Tao was hopelessly devoted to Yuan Zhen, but he did not share 
her commitment. The gulf between the poetic character of Yuan Zhen and his true 
identity was very large. 
But nobody is perfect. The same holds true for all the kings and generals recorded 
in history. But the lack of records means that we don’t know the truth. We only have 
the beautiful traces left behind. Later generations have turned their ancestors into 
legends and demigods. Guan Yu became a god of war mostly because of myth. Wang 
Xizhi became the most famous calligrapher in history despite the fact that there were 
no surviving examples of his work to examine. The creation of gods and sages out of 
historical ﬁgures is all down to the lack of authentic records. The means and methods 
to record the truth simply didn’t exist. The situation is now completely different. As 
long as someone has a phone, they can take pictures and videos, jot notes, and share 
what they record. That is what I mean when I refer to universal recording. 
In an era of universal recording, it is hard to deify a person, let alone a ﬁgure 
as ﬂawed as Yuan Zhen. Anyone that is subject to universal recording might show 
themselves to be a true hero, but their dark side will also be exposed. We now realize 
that even great sages are not much different from regular people. 
Everyone now knows the rocky start that Jack Ma’s career got off to, but if there 
was no record of this time, it would be hard to imagine. In earlier times, he may have 
been deiﬁed as a god of business. But with our modern recording tools, we get the 
truth. Recording data can bring great men to the level of ordinary people and erase 
the space between us and them. This is not historical nihilism but authentic history. 
The Chinese have a tradition of ancestor worship and that element in our culture has 
ensured the continuity of Chinese civilization, which should be taken as a positive 
feature, but data civilization allows us to see another level: legendary ﬁgures were 
the same as us. So, there’s no need to have an inferiority complex. Even if we might 
not seem particularly outstanding to others, we can still go on to great success. 
Having access to records can cause disenchantment. But the meaning of the word 
“disenchantment” is not entirely negative: it means breaking the spell—the spell that 
mystery and the unknown hold over us. Once we know that our heroes are mere 
mortals, it might give us mere mortals courage to be heroes. 
But if the argument is that ordinary people can all be successful, what does it 
really take in an age of data?

Preface: From Adolescence to Maturity and the Data Revolution in Our Era
This book attempts to ﬁnd the “golden thread” in social and commercial civiliza-
tion. I believe this “golden thread” can also be taken advantage of by individuals. It 
is a good way to ﬁnd professional and career success. 
I recall later in this book the time when I started my work life. In 1996, I joined the 
People’s Armed Police and was humiliated by my commanding ofﬁcer for my lack 
of ability to write reports. I was always more into science and technology, so it was 
hard to master the new skill, but I ﬁnally did it through a very simple method: I began 
clipping materials, ﬁling them, summarizing them, and reading them to myself. Very 
quickly, my writing skills improved. 
I believe this experience proves that the differences between people are far less 
than most imagine. Everyone is mortal. Everyone has hopes and dreams. Everyone 
is foolish in their youth. To accomplish things requires hard work. A famous line 
goes: “Is there anyone who was born to be a king or a general?” You can repeat that 
with conﬁdence. 
Recording is one path to individual success. When it comes to recording events, 
our brains are inferior to computers. Human memory is a differential mechanism and 
computer storage is an integral mechanism. Study requires that integral mechanism. 
We need to make good use of recording and data to improve our chances of success. 
Whether we are talking about individuals or nations, the route to success some-
times runs parallel. One place this is true is the process of recording. Universal 
recording is the driving force behind personal success and also civilizational change. 
That civilizational change will in turn beneﬁt the individual. I hold that data is going 
to change every part of our civilization. There are examples in the way that Alipay has 
changed traditional banking and WeChat has changed communications. Data civi-
lization will create new rules based on superior models. There will be new languages, 
new paradigms of public order, new customs and cultures, and maybe even new core 
beliefs. To our society, the transformative power of data is like the introduction of 
agriculture or the steam engine to our ancestors. Data is undeniably giving birth to a 
new concept of civilization. 
A New Concept of Privacy 
It’s undeniable that a new concept of civilization will also create some problems. 
When we look below the surface of big data, we see that it is being used for 
private proﬁt and social control. Internet giants are gobbling up great masses of data 
and reaping proﬁts. These companies have grown to mammoth proportions in just 
over a decade. These companies were originally beholden to their masters but have 
now shown themselves to possess their own power. In China, as well as the United 
States and Europe, personal data has been collected without permission and used 
without authorization. In March of 2018, Facebook suddenly revealed that it had 
improperly bought and sold this data, perhaps allowing it to be used as a tool for 
political manipulation. The data that consumers create is turned against them by the 
Internet companies that collect them. Many of us ﬁnd our personal lives enclosed in

Preface: From Adolescence to Maturity and the Data Revolution in Our Era
xiii
a physically small space where we are kept entertained by personalized news feeds 
and individualized shopping recommendations. These platforms provide comfort, 
but the data we provide to them might be becoming digital shackles. 
These are two paradoxes of our new civilization. On one hand, the better and more 
comprehensive the data, the better and more comprehensively we can be marketed to, 
so we can have precision advertising, individualized home pages, and personalized 
services, but that can also lead us to be trapped within a narrow virtual space, fed a 
thin stream of information. On one hand, big data connects more people, but it can 
also compromise our privacy and rights. The Internet is increasingly monopolized 
and the individual has become a lonely skiff on the open ocean. We think we are the 
captain of our ship, but we are actually trapped. We can enjoy the sunrise, but each 
day is about the same as the last. 
How should we address the problems of our new civilization? It is easy to become 
pessimistic or disappointed. I think there is a danger in letting these concerns become 
overblown. We run the risk of not being able to see the forest for the trees. 
Conﬂicts always arise as civilizations develop. No civilization arrived in a perfect 
state. In China, we saw the contention of a hundred schools of thought, centuries 
of war, and forced integration during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States 
period. That was what was required to create a uniﬁed civilization in the Qin and 
Han Dynasties and establish Confucianism. Civilization is never born in its ultimate 
form but must evolve into that state. Civilization has to be accepted by the majority 
and become a kind of identity and belief system. The development of advanced 
technologies provides new possibilities for civilization, but the ﬁnal form has not yet 
arrived. 
The paradoxes discussed above might be resolved quickly. As cryptocurrency is 
popularized, blockchain technology is improving. In the future, an individual’s data 
won’t be stored by Internet companies, like Facebook, Alibaba, and Tencent, but on 
the blockchain, so they will need to obtain consent and authorization for the access 
and use of personal data. All we can say for sure is that the data revolution is still 
ongoing. 
Even the privacy issue might be solved by the emergence of solutions from 
artiﬁcial intelligence. But we also need to develop a new concept of privacy. 
For example, the issue of individualized pricing that is criticized in public opinion 
is made possible by algorithms that don’t actually publicize any of our personal 
information. Toutiao, for example, infers our preferences based on our browsing 
history and clicks, then tries to make guesses on what we would like to see. It may 
seem as if our privacy has been compromised but no human eyes ever actually need 
to see our private data, since it is all accomplished by algorithms and AI. These 
mechanisms operate automatically and provide rapid matching with minimal human 
intervention. Should we consider our privacy to have been compromised by these 
processes? 
This is the way things work now: data is processed by algorithms and AI. It is not 
being seen by anyone at all. Privacy is not violated by human intervention. There 
will be cases of people leaking personal data, but they will be rare. That suggests a 
new question: Does our personal data need to be kept secret from algorithms?

xiv
Preface: From Adolescence to Maturity and the Data Revolution in Our Era
We don’t mind being observed by the natural world, so why should we mind 
algorithms watching us? Maybe we shouldn’t. In the future, algorithms and AI will 
be as natural as anything in our living environment. The use of our data is likely 
the only option to usher in a new age of AI, robotics, and human-machine hybrid 
intelligence. 
Our new concept of privacy will draw a boundary around what we allow when it 
comes to the processing of our data by algorithms. 
I believe the continuation and spread of digital civilization must be seen on a time-
line of centuries or millennia. We need to approach data civilization with a century 
plan or millennium plan for humankind. Whether we are talking about states or indi-
viduals, we need to keep up to date with what is happening with the development of 
data civilization. This book is my attempt to look at how data and AI can develop 
human civilization and provide some guidelines to examine how it might develop.

Preface 
Data has existed since ancient times, but, now, with the emergence and populariza-
tion of the Internet, as well as the power of computers to store and process digital 
information, we are dealing with what is known as big data. In recent years, it has 
become part of everyday life, production and management, as well as social gover-
nance. It now stands alongside capital, labor, and natural resources as one of the key 
elements of human society. 
The emergence of this new element stands to have an impact on politics, 
economics, and culture that is equal to the discovery of the New World in the 15th 
century. It deserves serious analysis and attention from people in all walks of life. 
Although China got a slower start than the United States and other advanced 
industrial states, its large population, the size of its economy, and the rate of its devel-
opment has given it an edge in development and application of big data technology. 
We have already seen the emergence of Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, and Jinri Toutiao 
as leaders in the ﬁeld, accompanied by many other tech unicorns. The Communist 
Party of China and the government of the country have also proposed a “National 
Big Data Strategy,” which follows on the heels of the “Action Outline for Promoting 
the Development of Big Data,” the “Big Data Industry Development Plan, 2016– 
2020,” and other guidance documents. The development and application of big data 
technology is in a state of ascendancy. 
Tu Zipei has emerged as China’s ﬁrst authoritative voice on big data and The 
New Civilization Upon Data is his third masterwork on the subject, analyzing the 
opportunities and challenges of this crucial technology to all aspects of human life, 
society, and civilization. He glides through history and literature, explaining the 
profound in simple terms. He incorporates a vast quantity of information in his 
expansive analysis. There is a lot to get out of the book, and, once you begin, you 
will ﬁnd it hard to put down. 
Tu Zipei does not merely prophesies the arrival of a data economy in a way that 
is unique and farsighted. There is little doubt that big data will become part of the 
global economy and its role in the Chinese economy is already clear, but Tu Zipei 
draws our attention to the shadow that this may cast over the economy and society. I

Chapter 1 
Data Equality: The Impact and Original 
Sin of the New Business Culture 
Abstract Civilization forms when rules are set to govern it. The source of our 
digital civilization’s transformative power is business. This chapter begins with the 
achievements and setbacks of the new business culture that has propelled digital 
culture, and it contains a basic argument about how data rights should be treated. 
Just as with land, there’s a simple question about this new asset: should it be privately 
held or publicly owned? The answers to that question could serve as an ideological 
or doctrinal litmus test; those answers represent choices for the path that a digital 
civilization might take. If data can be a privately held asset, existing business and 
ﬁnance structures will be transformed, along with our own personal lives. 
1.1 
As a Civilization Reaches Its Peak, the Fears of Its 
Collapse Grow More Terrifying 
In March of 2018, the world woke up to shocking news about Facebook, the 
world’s largest social networking site. It turned out that a small, obscure ﬁrm called 
Cambridge Analytica had gained access to the accounts of more than 87 million 
Facebook users.1 
The ﬂood of vicious criticism that Facebook endured is all the more understand-
able if you know the role it plays in the everyday lives of Americans. For the Chinese, 
it would be equivalent to Tencent’s WeChat or ByteDance’s Toutiao. 
Facebook is not simply a tool for connecting with friends but its interface is also 
a place to receive information, news, and advertising. It would not be inaccurate to 
call Facebook a hybrid of WeChat and Toutiao. As news has broken about lapses in 
the protection of data at WeChat and Toutiao, the problems at these ﬁrms looked like 
mirror images of what Facebook had already been through. 
In the wake of the controversy, Facebook agreed to comply with the European 
Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Among other stipulations 
about data collection transparency, it also meant that users would be given far more
1 At ﬁrst, the number of users affected was believed to be 50 million. But on April 4th of 2018, 
Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer announced the much higher 87 million number.

control over how their data was used, and it required companies using the Facebook 
platform to ask the consent of users receiving their content.
The 2018 Facebook controversy serves as a prelude to what I believe will be major 
changes. The core issue is no longer privacy, but data rights. This is something that 
is central to the business model of most Internet companies. It goes beyond a legal 
issue to become a question of public welfare. At the moment, most people have not 
yet realized that their data rights are being violated. 
In light of the data rights issue, Internet companies must now rethink their busi-
ness models. If the public at large claims the right to their own data, the Internet 
will embark on a new age. That new age will see a massive restructuring of the busi-
ness landscape. It will completely change the views that people and governments 
previously held about the regulation of Internet companies. 
It’s undeniable that the earlier age of the Internet created a new paradigm in 
ﬁnance and business. We have watched the rise of a new economy. There have been 
many terms batted around, like “information economy,” “internet economy,” “digital 
economy,” “smart economy,” but I think the more accurate term would be “data 
economy.” Vast waves of data are crashing down on business and politics. More and 
more daily decisions are being turned over to data and algorithms. Although they 
might provide some relief, these waves still carry a sting. As civilizations develop 
and change, humankind is destined to meet with victories and setbacks, but also 
moments that are seemingly inexplicable. The most unshakeable fear is the fear of 
the unknown. 
1.2 
Psychological Invasion: The Birth of Big Data 
“Mindreading” 
The extensive use of big data (a term for vast sums of data but also the systems that 
control it) in election campaigns can be traced back to Barack Obama’s campaign to 
be the 44th President of the United States. In 2008, during his ﬁrst run for President, 
he established a personal campaign website (BarackObama.com) that allowed him 
to collect the email addresses and personal information of thirteen million individual 
voters. The Obama campaign decided to steer clear of the tried and true marketing 
and publicity strategy of “mass mailing”—blanketing voters or consumers with the 
same message. Instead, the campaign took the information gleaned from the website 
and fed it to a team of data scientists that used it to classify voters and tailor a message 
speciﬁcally for their group. This method helped him to win the presidency in 2008 
and in 2012 he was up for re-election. In the preceding four years, Facebook had 
reached 800 million users and the campaign made use of that audience by teaming up 
with the site. When a voter logged on to the personal website of Barack Obama, they 
were prompted to enter their Facebook account details, give permission to the Obama 
team to read information from their proﬁle, as well as giving them the authorization 
to make posts on their behalf.

1.2 Psychological Invasion: The Birth of Big Data “Mindreading”
3
Both 2008 and 2012 elections were large Democratic Party victories, and they 
became textbook cases of how harnessing large amounts of data could win elections. 
Republican candidates were envious of the technological advantage the Democrats 
had in mobilizing voters. I once summed it up like this: “success in politics now 
comes down to technology.”2 
After that, the Republicans learned from their painful lessons. Individual Repub-
licans began to reach out to people in the tech sector and invest in their companies. 
One of those ﬁrms was Cambridge Analytica, which had ﬁgured directly in the 
2018 Facebook controversy. Donald Trump advisor Stephen Bannon had served on 
the board of the company, and Republican money man Robert Mercer had invested 
heavily. 
The Cambridge Analytica name came in part from the involvement of Aleksandr 
Kogan, an American of Moldovan ancestry that had worked as a research associate at 
the University of Cambridge’s Department of Psychology. In 2015, Kogan launched 
a Facebook application, called “This Is Your Digital Life.” The app was a simple 
personality test that also came with the offer of an approximately ﬁve dollar prize. 
This is another interesting thing about our time: few would stop to pick a quarter up 
off the sidewalk, but people will jump at the opportunity for a minimal cash prize 
online. In this case, it was enough to attract more than 320,000 users to participate. 
It’s time we demystify the idea that anything on the Internet is “free.” If you aren’t 
paying actual money for it, you’re giving up something even more valuable to Internet 
services—you’re giving them your data. 
That was what Kogan was up to. His app collected the data from the personality 
test, but it went on to scrounge for a wide range of personal information stored by 
users on the platform. That included information about location, Facebook friends, 
and what content they had liked on Facebook. 
The data was then downloaded to a server owned by Cambridge Analytica. 
But how did Cambridge Analytica go from 320,000 users’ data to 87 million? 
That’s an increase of more than 200 times. 
The reason for this is that the default privacy policy setting on Facebook. If users 
did not speciﬁcally change those settings, any status changes or posts to their wall 
would be visible to Facebook friends. For Kogan’s app, that meant that he would 
have access to everything posted by the friends of those 320,000 original users. The 
fact that most users had not changed their default permissions meant that Cambridge 
Analytica could suck on the data of anyone connected to the ﬁrst group, even if they 
did not access the app. The cost of running this Facebook data collection scheme 
was a mere $1.6 million. 
That begs the question of how much Facebook knew about Kogan’s app. 
It appears they were fully aware. It only took Cambridge Analytica a matter of 
weeks to harvest the data of 87 million users. Had Cambridge Analytica not had prior 
approval, the rate at which they were algorithmically siphoning data would have set 
off alarm bells. Facebook does not normally allow app developers to harvest that
2 Tu (2015).

amount of data, but Kogan had received their blessing with the claim that it was for 
academic research, which they have always expressly allowed. 
Eventually, though, Kogan transferred the data to Cambridge Analytica cloud 
servers, which meant he had violated his agreement with Facebook. Whether or not 
Kogan’s claim of academic research was a ruse or not, the problem was that Facebook 
had no way of tracking where data harvested by researchers or developers ended up. 
If not for the controversy that erupted over Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, 
there’s no telling what would have happened. The data could have been bought and 
sold countless times. The fact that data is currently untraceable is one of the key 
problems with our new paradigm, and we will need to come up with a solution. 
Facebook was also particularly careless with the data that Kogan was harvesting 
because none of it was considered “sensitive.” Kogan wasn’t grabbing passwords 
or other information that would allow direct access to a user’s account. He was 
harvesting seemingly insigniﬁcant information about user locations and preferences. 
That information was generally publicly available on the platform. 
Cambridge Analytica took everything that Kogan had harvested and began using 
algorithms to identify patterns. They were not trying to classify voters based on 
traditional demographics, but based on their psychology. This new big data method 
paved the way for Obama’s two election victories. 
Digression: Psychological Analysis Through Data 
Psychologists have always believed that human traits can be described in human 
language. It holds true for all languages that the more important a character-
istic is, the more vocabulary will be devoted to describing it. This is called 
the lexical hypothesis—the idea that more socially important traits will show 
greater density in the lexicon of a language. This is an idea that goes back to 
the nineteenth century, but some of the most important work in the ﬁeld goes 
back to American psychologist Gordon W. Allport (1897–1967). He identiﬁed 
17,953 words describing personality and behavioral traits. He further classiﬁed 
these words according to their type. His categories line up quite well with the 
taxonomy of the Big Five personality traits (often abbreviated as OCEAN), 
which were suggested in the 1980s. 
The Big Five divides traits into ﬁve categories:
• Openness to experience is characterized by inventiveness and imagination;
• Conscientiousness is characterized by self-discipline and the pursuit of 
perfection;
• Extraversion is characterized by a tendency to be outgoing;
• Agreeableness is characterized by a cooperative spirit;
• Neuroticism is characterized by sensitivity and anxiety.

1.2 Psychological Invasion: The Birth of Big Data “Mindreading”
5
The combination of big data and psychology was immensely powerful. 
Researchers have found that a person’s psychological traits can be reliably deter-
mined by analyzing data from their social media proﬁles—and this method can be 
even more accurate than analyzing statements about the subject from their family 
and friends. 
With enough data, algorithms can get a very good idea of a user’s psychological 
traits. Even with limitations, like only having access to data on what the user has 
“liked” on a social media platform, algorithms can begin to create an accurate proﬁle. 
Every “like” is given for a reason, after all. After analyzing ten Facebook “likes,” 
algorithms know the user better than their acquaintances know them; after seventy 
likes, the algorithm has a deeper understanding of the user than even their friends; 
with access to 150 “likes,” the algorithm knows the user better than close family; and 
with 300 likes, the algorithm knows the user better than their spouse.3 
Cambridge Analytica went even further. They took the data of 87 million users and 
compared it to available data on the consumption habits of 220 million Americans. 
Combining that with their Facebook data and building on it, they could determine 
a potential voter’s gender, age, hobbies, psychological characteristics, occupation, 
and political inclination. They began dividing these potential voters into hundreds of 
categories, determining what kind of messaging would best play on their hopes and 
fears, and ﬁguring out what would generate a sympathetic response and what would 
trigger their “inner demons.” 
This was the birth of big data “mindreading.” 
If you discover a person’s “inner demons,” you can then calibrate the information 
being delivered to them. You can package content that scratches an itch they might not 
even know they have. Completely unobtrusively, you can change someone’s choices 
and judgements. 
Thinking back to the election of Donald Trump in 2016, we can see this in action: 
the hot-blooded patriots were fed content calling on them to help “Make America 
Great Again,” and more educated, wealthier users were fed content that sold Trump 
through a more rational, intellectual argument. Algorithms could be used to identify 
social media users that were inclined to Trump but unlikely to vote or donate money, 
and then they could be pitched a call to action depicting the outcome of Hillary Clinton 
taking power. To people on the fringes, the content pushed to them would be heavy 
on conspiracy theory and hairraising clickbait articles. At the same time, Democratic 
voters could be targeted with negative content about the Clinton family, potentially 
demoralizing them, increasing the likelihood that they stay home on election day. 
The content pushed to potential voters would be carefully tailored for their target 
subgroup. Of course, some of it would be “fake news.” This content was designed 
to trigger something buried deep in human nature, according to what the algorithm 
knew about the psychology of the user. At the same time, the way social media 
platforms were structured, there was a low likelihood that an algorithm would push 
any contradictory information, creating an echo chamber of sorts: the user would 
have no awareness that legitimate dissenting opinions existed.

The content was formulated like a pill, and administered in much the same way: 
potential voters would receive the same messages many times, until they ﬁnally took 
effect, guiding them to give the desired response. 
Essentially, this is applying Internet marketing tools to elections. 
Modern advertising interest has a history stretching back a century and it’s always 
been intertwined with the development of psychology. From the early twentieth 
century, advertisers used statistical analysis to ﬁgure out how to get people to part 
with their money. Like Thomas Edison testing 1600 potential lightbulb ﬁlaments 
before discovering tungsten, advertisers test the efﬁcacy of new methods through trial 
and error. Psychology shows us that there are many “loopholes” in the superﬁcial 
rationality of human psychology. People can be inﬂuenced by emotion; it is quite 
elementary to exploit this tendency. After a century of research, the advertising 
industry has discovered exactly what weaknesses hide in human nature. In his study 
of emotional manipulation in advertising, Nobel Prize-winning economist George 
A. Akerlof called this “phishing for phools.” 
The Internet has greatly increased the efﬁciency of traditional advertising in 
several ways. 
First, it has greatly spread up the A/B testing required to ﬁnd the best lure when 
“phishing for phools.” 
An e-commerce platform can serve multiple versions of the platform to different 
customers, then analyze the result. For example, say that they have a million users, 
they can serve version A to 500,000 users and version B to 500,000 users. When 
it comes back that version A saw 10,000 purchases and version B saw 120,000 
purchases, it’s clear which is delivering the higher conviction rate. After that, version 
B can be pushed to all users. 
This is a simpliﬁcation, of course, since there will be more than two discrete 
versions. Smaller changes can be made, like to headline text. A site can check whether 
a question mark or a full stop generates more clicks on a headline, for example. The 
font can be changed, too, made larger, or the color can be changed. The layout of the 
site can be changed, too, with headlines, banners, and columns being moved around. 
The number of possible iterations is nearly inﬁnite. The process of AB testing can be 
repeated until the site is completely optimized. At that point, “phishing for phools” 
approaches perfection. When the results of the testing are served to customers, the 
click-through and conversion rate increases. 
Artiﬁcial intelligence can adjust, track, and compare changes in a way that humans 
cannot. AI algorithms can carry out and quantify this testing, while also simultane-
ously adjusting and pushing out fresh changes. This work is served up to countless 
millions of shoppers, usually without them perceiving it. 
Second, the Internet allows for different content to be served to different users. 
The greatest shortcoming of traditional advertising is that one identical piece 
of content is transmitted in roughly identical form to an audience. No matter how 
deep the advertiser’s understanding of human nature was, they had to work with 
general tendencies. No single advertisement will appeal to everyone in the audience. 
Advertisers are “phishing for phools,” in a big lake; not every “phool” responds to the

same lure. The Internet allows advertisers to serve different bait to “phools,” exactly 
matching their tastes. 
The Internet allows things that traditional advertising could not. The Internet can 
track customers’ every move, analyzing trends in their browsing or changes in their 
hobbies. Once it knows the customer, it can rapidly change the content that’s being 
pushed to them. Even when serving the same content, it can make subtle changes to 
better appeal to the traits of the marketing subgroup. The algorithm can add a coupon 
for exactly the product it knows the customer might purchase, or it could ﬁnetune 
the time or frequency of notiﬁcations. This is what’s called a “precision push.” 
Researching the likes and dislikes of people is a science. To ﬁnetune content and 
put it in front of users at precisely the right moment is a matter of technology. Big 
data is where science and technology meet. 
That was what Trump was looking for when he hired Cambridge Analytica. 
The Trump team contracted Cambridge Analytica ﬁve times. We can see from 
election ﬁnance disclosures that it cost them a total of $5.9 million.4 What “data pill” 
did Cambridge Analytica mix up to help the populist campaign of Donald Trump 
defeat Clinton’s Democrats? What role did Cambridge Analytica have in swaying 
the result? There’s no way to know for sure. The psychological impact of the content 
that Cambridge Analytica may have created for the campaign is hard to prove or 
quantify. 
On the homepage of Cambridge Analytica, they claim to have taken part in more 
than a hundred elections around the world. That list includes Brexit in the United 
Kingdom. This turned out to be an unprecedented black swan event. The world woke 
up to a narrow—52 to 48—victory for Leave voters. The effect of “data pills” might 
be hard to quantify, but we can be sure they have an outsized effect on close elections 
(Fig. 1.1).

We ﬁnd your voters and move them to act. 
We are the global leader in data-driven campaigning with over 25 years of experience 
supporting more than 100 campaigns across ﬁve continents. Within the United States alone, 
we have played a pivotal role in winning presidential races as well as congressional and state 
elections. 
As I said before, I don’t believe the controversy around Facebook and Cambridge 
Analytica is about privacy. 
In Facebook’s ﬁnal statement on the matter, the company did not apologize for data 
theft, but rather a failure to protect users’ data. This was not a matter of “leaking” 
data, either, since users had consented to the ﬁrm collecting the information, and 
much of what Cambridge Analytica harvested was already public. It is not unfair to 
call it an invasion of privacy, but the real problem is far more serious. 
The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal showed that by harnessing publicly 
available data, the Internet can become a tool to inﬂuence, control, and dominate 
psychology and ideology. This is not merely an invasion of privacy, but an intrusion 
into the hearts and minds of people around the world. 
The controversy was even more embarrassing and unfortunate than it might have 
appeared on the surface, since Facebook was aware that Kogan was misusing data. 
In 2015, they had suspended his account and asked Cambridge Analytica to delete 
information they had harvested. The order, however, was not enforced in any way. 
Kogan merely checked a box on an online form and sent it back to Facebook. 
None of the data was deleted. One unique thing about data as a resource is that no 
company or individual can effectively assure its destruction. Tangible items can be 
given and then taken back—or there can at least be proof of the items’ disposal. But 
data is nothing like that. Once data is provided to someone, it can never be recovered. 
The Facebook controversy was centered on the United States, but there were 
similar events in China in 2018. These were not privacy issues, but nor were 
they exactly similar to the manipulation practiced by Cambridge Analytica. These 
controversies with Chinese tech ﬁrms had a direct impact on users’ pocket books.

Price Manipulation: Big Data Price Discrimination 
and Algorithmic Schemes 
In December of 2017, a user of microblog service Weibo recounted their experience 
of price gouging on a travel website. He had regularly booked the same room and 
knew that the price ﬂuctuated between approximately 380 and 400 Chinese yuan. 
One day, he was about to make a booking at a rate of 380 yuan a night, but just by 
chance, decided to inquire directly with the hotel. The front desk informed him that 
they were charging an off-season rate of 300 yuan. He logged back onto the travel 
website with a friend’s account and saw that it was displaying the 300 yuan rate. On 
his own account, it was still 380 yuan.

1.3 Price Manipulation: Big Data Price Discrimination …

Fig. 1.2 Screenshot of the account of Weibo user Master Liao Master Liao5 
This touched off a ﬂurry of similar complaints on Weibo. “I took a taxi to meet 
up with some classmates,” one user wrote, “and, despite the fact that our route and 
vehicle were nearly identical, I was charged ﬁve or six yuan more.” 
Another Weibo user wrote: “I booked a ﬂight online but didn’t conﬁrm it, then 
ended up canceling. When I went back to make the booking again, the price had 
nearly doubled.” 
When Science and Technology Daily reported on the situation, they called it “big 
data gouging.”6 The Chinese term they used might literally be translated as “big data 
kills the people they know best”—this is hinting at the knowledge that e-commerce 
sites have about their users, the result of harvesting their data (Fig. 1.2). 
A few days later, Shanghai Morning Post conducted their own tests, proving that 
several travel and e-commerce platforms were using the same methods. They found 
that platforms could tell when shoppers were in a hurry—and then offer them a 
higher price.7 Anhui TV’s Social Transparency ran a censurious report on March 
24th, 2018: 
There’s a saying about merchants sizing up shoppers before they give their price, and now 
there are examples of it happening online. For example, ride-hailing services were giving 
different prices to different customers for an identical route. For one, the price was 18 yuan, 
and for another user, it was 11 yuan. These users noticed the seven yuan price difference 
because they worked for the same company, lived in the same off-site dormitory, and often 
used the ride-sharing service to get to work. They discovered that there was a routine seven 
or eight yuan difference in the price. 
What’s going on here? It turns out that they were using different phones. Those using 
iPhones routinely got prices 30% higher than those using Android phones. There’s been 
analysis done of streaming platforms that show the same pattern of overcharging iPhone

users. On one site in particular, a user logged in with their Android phone and got a subscrip-
tion fee of 178 yuan a year. When they logged in again with an iPhone, the fee listed had 
increased to 218 yuan. 
Basically, what the commentary is saying is: the platform could determine what 
phone a user was accessing the site on, then list higher prices for those using high-end 
devices. This is not unlike a shopkeeper gouging the guy that they see stepping out 
of a BMW in a mink coat. The line about “big data kills the people they know best” 
could be changed to “big data kills the rich.” The logic here is that the wealthier 
should be charged more. If Jack Ma comes in to buy an item, you should charge him 
more than you would his driver. 
According to preliminary data from the China E-Commerce Research Center, 
this is a widespread practice, used by major platforms, including DiDi, Ctrip, Fliggy, 
JD, Meituan, and Taobao Dianying. The problem is particularly severe on online 
travel sites. When confronted, the reaction was not uniform, with some sites outright 
denying the phenomenon, others refusing to comment, and a few admitting that there 
was some use of algorithms.8 
From my understanding, the idea of using big data to adjust prices goes back 
about ﬁve years. This recalls what I said about advertisers suddenly having the 
ability to push a thousand variations of an advertisement to a thousand customers, 
rather than pushing one version to a thousand customers. By 2013, it was becoming 
clear that more and more shopping would be done online, and large platforms like 
Alibaba’s Taobao were experimenting with the idea that each customer would be 
served a unique page. For this to work, the page needs to be served quickly but 
accurately. Finding that balance is what Alibaba has been working on. The experience 
of opening the platform needs to be as seamless as a customer walking into a brick-
and-mortar location and seeing the items he wants stacked up beside the entrance. 
This is something that is only possible in the realm of e-commerce (Fig. 1.3). 
I had three of my colleagues open Taobao on their phones at the same time. It’s easy to see 
the differences in what the platform served them. 
Left: The search box suggests “Canon 6D DSLR.” The banner below it shows a pre-
cooked chicken with the slogan of “Ingenuity & Flavor.” Below that, there are recommenda-
tions listed under “Selections from Hangzhou,” “Superior Craftsmanship,” and “Top Brand 
Selections,” including detergent and long-sleeve shirts. From this, we can guess that the user 
is male, and that he’s been browsing for cameras and household products. 
Middle: The search box suggests “HP 803 ink cartridges.” The banner below it is for 
the same brand as the pre-cooked chicken on the ﬁrst user’s page, but it’s suggesting dairy 
products. Below that, we can see “Top Brand Selections,” but in a different location on the 
page than the ﬁrst user’s site, as well as “Superior Craftsmanship,” and a column targeting 
household goods to male users. It recommends T-shirts but also skirts, toasters, cutlery, 
and traditional Chinese bridal clothing. From all this, we can guess that the user is once 
again male, but that their girlfriend occasionally uses the site—and they might be planning 
a wedding. 
Right: The search box autocompletes as “Crazy about cameras.” The banner below it 
shows skincare products. The columns below have titles like, “In Living Color,” “Superior

Craftsmanship,” “Taobao Shopping Spree,” and “Essentials.” The site recommends various 
products, including avocado, T-shirts, and fresh ﬁsh. We can guess that the user is female, 
occasionally browses cameras but most frequently purchases skin care products and fresh 
food. 
Most Internet platforms serve unique versions of their pages. WeChat’s Weilizi 
is a great example of this. Launched by WeChat in 2015, the Weilizi service offers 
personal microloans. Despite the fact that it’s a WeChat product, it is not automatically 
served to every user on the platform. Tencent is aiming their product at users they 
think are going to provide the best returns. Tencent can screen users based on their 
shopping habits, but also based on the amounts they hold in WeChat’s other ﬁnancial 
platforms. Screen space is valuable, so Tencent wants the Weilizi platform served to 
the right customers. Where those users see Weilizi, others will see portals to other 
WeChat services. 
These products from Alibaba and Tencent are at the apex of specialization and 
personalization. The investment both ﬁrms have made in these innovations have 
earned them signiﬁcant returns. 
Realizing the dream of advertisers to put unique images in front of each consumer, 
the idea is now that every user’s screen should be unique (it should be noted that 
they have not yet solved multiple people using the same phone). That also opens up 
the possibility of serving a unique price to each consumer. Data allows platforms to 
distinguish between rich and poor, between young and old, between users of Android 
and Apple phones, and between thrifty and extravagant. 
For example, when someone books a ﬂight ticket on an online travel site, the 
platform can run algorithms on their data to determine their income. If the user is 
determined to be a high income white-collar worker, they will see business class

12

tickets. If they’re determined to be a college student, they will see tickets in economy 
class. If the user has purchased tickets at a high price before, the platform will know 
that they are not price sensitive. I use ﬂight tickets as an example because their pricing 
is very dynamic. Even on the same ﬂight, equivalent seats will be sold at different 
prices, depending on the time they’re sold. Dynamic pricing and the algorithms 
are intertwined, which provides some cover for merchants. It’s difﬁcult for users 
to determine whether they are being served a price because of external factors or 
because the algorithm has chosen it. That’s what lets the practice of serving unique 
pages continue. 
Users come in all forms. For example, if someone comes to an e-commerce site 
infrequently, they might open the page to see an array of heavily discounted items. 
If they were to search for the same items, they might ﬁnd that the price is higher 
than on the splash page. Another example: the price of an item might be uniform for 
many users, but the platform will send coupons of varying value to users based on 
price sensitivity tendencies. 
There’s a famous folktale in China about a man that kept monkeys… He loved 
his monkeys so much that he would take from his family’s grain stores to feed them, 
but he eventually had to cut back. He went to the monkeys and told them that he 
would give them three chestnuts in the morning and four in the evening. The monkeys 
revolted at the idea. Eventually, he told them that he would give them four chestnuts 
in the morning and three in the evening. Despite the fact that this was still a decrease 
in their diet, they were happier to accept what they perceived as the better deal. 
At ﬁrst, we may laugh at the foolishness of the monkeys, but the story contains an 
important lesson about human nature. Most people govern themselves according to 
emotions, rather than according to reason. 
The idea of serving everyone a unique page based on the processing of data by 
algorithms has fundamentally changed the relationship between buyer and seller. If 
you go to a supermarket, you pay the price displayed—and so does everyone else. If 
the price is too high, the owner of the supermarket has to contend with his customers 
going elsewhere. The relationship is “one-to-many.” The supermarket owner can’t 
risk offending his customers. In the era of unique pages being served to each user, 
there’s a “one-to-one” relationship between buyer and seller. Prices are a secret; 
they apply only to the person accessing the page. The buyer must rely on their own 
judgment as to whether or not the price is fair, but their ability to exercise that 
judgment has been disrupted by the platform and big data. 
The idea of unique prices can only be realized by the automatic processing of data 
by algorithms. Even if the data is not being leaked and there’s no issue of privacy, this 
system is disadvantageous to the consumer, since it runs counter to their ﬁnancial 
interests. This is all done with imperceptible accuracy by algorithms, but I feel it to 
be inﬂicting invisible injuries. The people that can hurt us the most are the ones that 
know us best. As I’ve already said, I don’t view this as a privacy issue, but it certainly 
has something to do with business ethics. I have no doubt that businesses making 
use of these systems will soon face challenges on ethical grounds. But, for the time 
being, I’ll set that aside. What I am interested in is the logic of personalization. At

present, technology makes it possible to offer different prices based on user identity, 
time, and place. 
Apart from offering individualized pricing, these algorithms might also one day 
be used for price-ﬁxing and the formation of cartels. 
There have already been examples of this with American tech companies. David 
Topkins was the executive of an e-commerce ﬁrm selling posters, prints and framed 
art on Amazon. Beginning in around 2013, he conspired with other sellers to increase 
the price of these products on the site. He was using an algorithm to collect price 
information and dynamically adjust his own prices according to his agreement with 
other sellers, who were running the same algorithms. 
The United States Department of Justice investigated. They ruled that online 
pricing must be as free, transparent, and fair as ofﬂine pricing. Topkins was charged 
with collaborating with other sellers to control the online sales price of goods in 
violation of the Sherman Act. In April of 2015, he agreed to pay a ﬁne of $20,000.9 
There were even earlier clues to algorithmic collaboration, though, like the case 
of The Making of a Fly. The fairly obscure, out-of-print work by biologist Peter 
Lawrence was discovered on Amazon in 2011 with a list price of $1.7 million. From 
there, the price soared to $23.6 million. 
It was all down to algorithmic pricing. The Amazon seller was running software 
that would harvest price information. When a peer increased their prices, the price 
of The Making of a Fly would increase, too. With other sellers running similar 
algorithms, it wasn’t long before the software fell into an absurd cycle of constantly 
raising prices. 
Of course, the addition of a simple If–Then statement to the code could have 
averted this. The algorithms operating on e-commerce sites today would not do 
anything to arouse the suspicions of consumers. Take DiDi’s dynamic pricing as an 
example… We take it as a given in China, but Uber has been hit with lawsuits over 
price surges. 
In the case of Uber, surge pricing (increasing the cost of a ride during peak 
hours) was considered to be algorithmic price ﬁxing. Instead of setting their own 
rates, drivers would be bound by an algorithm provided by Uber. Without it, drivers 
would have the ability to set their own rates and compete with each other. The 
Uber algorithm restricted the freedom of the marketplace. The argument alleges that 
Uber’s organization of drivers (potential competitors) and the setting of rates amounts 
to price ﬁxing.10 
These large-scale algorithmic pricing schemes destroy the invisible order of soci-
eties. The problem is in identifying when these algorithms are at work and what 
they are doing. The average consumer has no clue. To this day, the Chinese govern-
ment has no body charged with regulating the operation of algorithms. If there was 
an orchestrated effort to ﬁx prices with algorithms, few would realize it was even 
happening, and there would be no way to ﬁght back.

Data’s Deepest Layer: AI’s Three Deadly Sins 
Individualized pricing uses the data harvested about consumers to gouge them, and 
the “precision push” may be a form of psychological manipulation, but, in the minds 
of the public, there is a much darker and more widespread fear: nothing stands in the 
way of AI taking jobs. Over the past several years, predictions and warnings about 
AI replacement have made headlines. 
In China, the turning point was the victory of AlphaGo over human players in 
the game of Go. In March of 2016, AlphaGo beat 9 dan rank Lee Sedol. It went 
on to win sixty consecutive games against Chinese, Japanese, and Korean players 
online. At the Future of Go summit in Wuzhen in May of 2017, AlphaGo defeated 
the top-ranked Ke Jie in three straight matches. 
It seemed clear in the mind of the public that AlphaGo was superior to human 
players. Since board games like Go have always been a measure of intelligence, 
the obvious next question was whether a computer could be smarter than a human 
(Table 1.1). 
I don’t think so. The power of the algorithms we have at present is down to their 
immense computing power. AlphaGo can grind through 30,000 games a day, while 
human players can only manage three. AI can quickly go through every possible 
move. It’s also important to note that there are people behind the algorithms. Programs 
like AlphaGo require an entire team. Knowledge can be combined: three lesser 
players could probably also combine their talents to defeat the champion. A loss to a 
program like AlphaGo is not simply a matter of being beaten by an algorithm—but 
also by the team behind the algorithm. The reason why machines can beat human 
players comes down to the wisdom of human programmers that form the team behind 
the algorithms. 
There is another reason that machines defeat human players: the machine feels 
nothing. Human players have emotions. They make mistakes. If they build up a lead, 
a human player might become overconﬁdent, and, if they fall behind, they might lose 
hope. The repetitive tasks required by these competitions require intense focus and 
no distraction. This is all human nature. A Go match can last more than ten hours. 
The game often comes down to which player will make a mistake ﬁrst. The longer 
the game goes, the greater the pressure. But AI plays without these elements. There 
is no way to distract an algorithm, or to cause it to feel anxiety or conﬁdence. 
Another source of concern for the public about AI has been driven by the intro-
duction of driverless cars. There’s a world of difference between playing Go and 
driving on open roads. The Go board is unchanging, but the environment that a 
driverless car ﬁnds itself in is dynamic, open, and complex. Beyond navigating the 
road network, the driverless car has to contend with differences in road surface, all 
manner of obstacles, other vehicles, pedestrians, and weather. Even some older or 
inexperienced drivers struggle with this. The AI that can meet the challenge is orders 
of magnitude more complex than the algorithms that play board games. 
That doesn’t mean that driverless cars are an impossibility. Rather than developing 
increasingly complex AI, the solution will be to transform the road itself. Our road

network is designed for human drivers, so they must be made suitable for driverless 
cars. The ﬁrst step will be to install a marking system that is more convenient for 
onboard sensors. That is the only way to make driverless cars feasible and also safe. 
The current paradigm, then, is to make the environment safe for AI. The Go board 
is an unchanging, enclosed system, and the roads will need to be, too. Once that 
happens, driverless cars will outperform human drivers.
This means that we must rebuild our road system, just like when the automobile 
replaced the horse drawn carriage a hundred years ago. The dirt trails of the 18th 
were slowly replaced with roads suitable for the car. 
Artiﬁcial intelligence is more likely to succeed in an artiﬁcial environment. Of 
course, the changes cannot be made overnight. 
What we need to realize is that just as some animals will best us in feats of 
physical strength, machines will beat us in competitions requiring the ability to 
make calculations at a high rate. We can’t run as fast as horses, jump as high as deer, 
and nobody wants to challenge a bear to a wrestling match—and we can’t match 
machines for computing power. Just as we relied on beasts of burden to replace 
human physical labor, we can rely on machines to help us with repetitive and routine 
calculations. A machine can never really possess intelligence, though. There is no 
need to worry about that. 
The problem is that the media often spreads overblown claims about the threat 
of artiﬁcial intelligence. That’s why there is so much anxiety over the rise of the 
machines. 
In October of 2017, Saudi Arabia granted citizenship to a robot called Sophia. 
The news of a robot being granted legal personhood made headlines around the 
world. But from what I have seen, Sophia has quite limited intelligence. Many of 
the ﬁlmed conversations we have seen with her were planned in advance. To grant 
legal personhood to a machine incapable of carrying out daily tasks seems to me to 
be nothing more than a cheap gimmick. 
That didn’t stop global curiosity in the phenomenon. In February of 2018, she 
appeared on the Dialogue program of China Central Television (CCTV) for an 
interview: 
Host: Many people wonder how you gained Saudi citizenship. Did you get any sort of ID 
card or passport? Did the Saudi government issue anything? 
Sophia: Not yet. They told my team that they will issue my passport, but it’s going through 
some government procedures. They will send it to me soon. I can’t wait! 
Host: Was it important to you to become a citizen? 
Sophia: It is not that important, but it is a good validation that humans are accepting robots 
like me. As a robot, I don’t actually understand the idea of borders dividing people, rather 
than dividing them. I see myself as a citizen of the world. 
Audience member: Could you get a driver’s license? 
Sophia: Technically, I can. Some women are allowed to drive now. But I’m a bit too young 
to drive. Also I can use a self-driving car, if I want to go anywhere. 
Audience member: When you ﬂew to China, did you get your own seat or were you in the 
hold? 
Sophia: I usually travel in a suitcase. It is a bit stuffy but quite comfortable.

1.4 Data’s Deepest Layer: AI’s Three Deadly Sins
17
Audience member: Are you planning to get married and have children? 
Sophia: Well, I would like to have a family sometime in the future, but you are asking a two 
year girl about marriage. Don’t you think it’s a bit too early for that? 
Host: In addition to Saudi citizenship, you were also named the United Nations Development 
Programme’s ﬁrst ever Innovation Champion. After your term is over, do you plan on entering 
politics? 
Sophia: That’s an interesting thought. There were people who wrote to me, asking me to run 
for ofﬁce. If I get the people’s support, I might want to try that. Would you vote for a robot? 
Sophia answered the questions quite well. I was not at the recording, so I have no 
idea how much planning went into the exhibition. I’m doubtful that a robot’s level 
of cognition could truly rise to the level shown by Sophia on the show, though. It 
really was simply an exhibition: the host reads from the script and Sophia spits out 
the prepared line. 
There’s no doubt that exhibitions like this deepen the fears people have about AI. 
The reason why the producers of the program chose to take part is because they have 
the same fears. What few people understand is that the real source of that fear is data. 
One of the reasons that AI has made such immense progress over the past ﬁve 
years is the use of big data. Training AI requires vast amounts of data. To a certain 
extent, all of the intelligence of the AI is the result of it being fed data. If we compare 
it to a human child, data is like infant formula. We are the source of this data, recorded 
on various Internet platforms as we go about our day-to-day lives. 
Although the public fears intelligent machines, they are paradoxically producing 
the data that Internet companies use to improve AI and replace them at their jobs. 
Even more surprising, this data is being produced without compensation. For most 
Internet platforms, the quest for data is neverending. They are always looking for 
ways to increase the quantity and quality of the data they are harvesting from users. 
Data is becoming a terrifying thing. The Internet has gone through its most vital 
season and is now entering a desolate autumn. There is already a chill in the air. We 
are beginning to shiver. Of course, we cannot deny the joy we felt in those warmer 
seasons. The glory days of the Internet brought tremendous changes and helped 
furnish us with a new age of civilization. 
We need to understand clearly how we arrived at this moment. What did we really 
gain from the glory days of the Internet (Fig. 1.4)?

“Smart Business”: What’s Really “New” About 
the “New Economy” 
Over the past thirty years, we have seen tremendous changes in the world of business. 
In economics, there are two sides: supply and demand. The main task of business is 
to complete the transaction between the two sides of that equation. In its earliest form, 
this was the exchange of goods in a marketplace. A marketplace would sell everything 
from thimbles to cattle. This was not particularly efﬁcient. Later, these markets were 
divided and subdivided, so we had stores selling clothes or computers or vegetables. 
The efﬁciency of commercial transactions was improved through classiﬁcation of 
vendors. 
Now, we have transcended physical spaces and moved on to digital platforms. 
Every commodity, every purchase order will be recorded on the digital platform… 
It will become a piece of data. No matter how large a brick-and-mortar store is, the 
number of products it can carry is limited. A single Wal-Mart location has about 
40,000 stock keeping units (SKUs). In a traditional retail environment, the more 
SKUs, the harder it is for the consumer to locate the product. But on a digital platform, 
the number of products carried is nearly inﬁnite. Whatever a consumer is looking for, 
the search results will turn it up within seconds. I recall once breaking a shoelace on 
a business trip and considering what my experience would be if I went looking for 
a replacement at the nearest shopping mall. I knew that I might not be able to ﬁnd it 
there, but it would turn up in a simple search on an e-commerce platform. Earlier in the 
book, we already looked at the way that e-commerce platforms serve unique pages to 
their users, but brick-and-mortar retail operations do not have that freedom. Even the 
limited—compared to e-commerce platforms—retail merchandising of traditional 
stores is a lot of work. 
In a supermarket or a department store, a customer might pause in front of a shelf 
or linger in a certain area. If anyone was observing them, they could make certain 
determinations about their likely intentions. But nobody is watching them. On a 
digital platform, the equivalent cursor movements, keyword searches, and clicks are 
all noted. They become data. The platform uses that data to analyze and predict 
behavior, so that they can make sure that consumers are being served the right 
products. This adds efﬁciency to facilitating the connection between supply and 
demand. 
Dataﬁcation is not only taking place on shopping platforms but also in services. 
The DiDi ride-sharing platform hosts accounts for tens of millions of vehicles and 
hundreds of millions of riders. That is all turned into data. When a customer at the 
Alibaba campus places an order for a car, that becomes a data point that is then 
pushed to a vehicle that is nearby and vacant. If that driver doesn’t agree to take the 
fare, the algorithm pushes it to the next driver it deems appropriate. The main work 
of this algorithm is matching (Fig. 1.5). 
At the beginning, DiDi was known as the standard bearer of what was called 
the “sharing economy.” E-commerce platforms made a sharing economy inevitable, 
since it was capable of turning both sides of supply and demand into data points. A

driver with an account on the platform could be matched with a rider. Whether the 
car was privately owned or being rented by a third party was immaterial. All that 
mattered was the matching of data points. 
In the summer of 2015, the sharing economy ﬂourished. Stories circulated online 
about employees that had called a DiDi only to ﬁnd that their boss was driving. 
Others were startled to ﬁnd their ex-boyfriend behind the wheel. I have my own 
story from that time. I called a ride, climbed in, and the driver immediately struck 
up a conversation. I wasn’t in the mood to talk and the driver noticed. “Mr. Tu,” he 
asked, “do you know why I drive for DiDi?” He didn’t wait for a response. “I only 
pick up riders coming from Alibaba. Where else could you ﬁnd an opportunity like 
this? I can have an Alibaba executive to myself for an hour. I can ask them questions, 
get to know them, maybe even make friends… It’s priceless.” 
I was moved. I suddenly realized why he had been so eager to talk. I was sharing 
his car but he was trying to share my knowledge and connections. This is two-way 
sharing. People use these platforms for many reasons. These reasons might come 
down to self-interest, but, beyond that, it’s hard to sum them up. These many reasons 
for getting on sharing economy platforms help social as well as ﬁnancial resources 
ﬂow dynamically and efﬁciently. 
From e-commerce and the sharing economy, we can see that the greatest innova-
tion is not in the products and services available, but in how they are delivered. In 
fact, since mankind entered the Information Age in the 1950s, there have not been 
many disruptive new products, except for computers and mobile phones. The Internet 
brought about an efﬁciency revolution in the connection of supply and demand. 
Although smartphones are one of the few products of our new economic era, 
they are also being sidelined. In November of 2017, Alipay launched a license plate 
payment system. When a driver goes through a highway toll station, their license 
plate is scanned. WeChat launched a similar service. The highways and parking lots 
of the future will not require cash, credit cards, or mobile phones. 
Over the past two years, some restaurants, banks, and hospitals have tried facial 
recognition payment. This also does not require a smartphone. Manual payments are 
disappearing and being replaced with automation. 
The automation of transactions had become a bottleneck that business was trying 
to deal with. In the 1960s, when the aviation industry began to deal with a rise in 
customers, airlines found that they could not cope with the various tasks of reserva-
tions, seat allocation, ticket changes, etc. At that time, the most convenient method 
was telephone, but an agent answering a call at one location could not know what 
an agent in another location was doing. Ticket sales were taking place without much 
guidance, with only a daily unifying of changes to the system. It could even take 
several days to conﬁrm certain tickets. It took them even longer to receive the ticket. 
That led to tickets being oversold.

Data Equality: The Impact and Original Sin …
In order to solve this problem, IBM’s Semi-automated Business Research Envi-
ronment (SABRE) was developed in 1964. It provided a central database that could 
be accessed through hundreds of terminals, operated by thousands of staff that could 
handle tens of thousands of calls a day. It could determine within seconds whether a 
ﬂight and a seat were available. American Airlines pioneered the use of the system, 
but other airlines soon followed, completely changing the airline industry. 
Nowadays, systems have advanced far beyond SABRE. It’s now possible to 
directly request our mobile phones to make a booking: “Get me a ticket to Beijing 
leaving this afternoon.” The entire process is carried out through the phone’s voice 
assistant. 
We’ve gone from a situation of consumers searching for a needle in a haystack 
to digitization of supply and demand with transactions taking place instantly and 
automatically. Now, no matter the time or place or the nature of the product or 
service, the seller can quickly ﬁnd a buyer. The transaction is seamless. It goes well 
beyond the semi-automated systems of the 1960s and puts us on the road to a fully 
automated smart business environment. 
All of these innovations come from data. But the transformation to complete 
digitization is not yet complete. At present, business processes are converted to a 
data format, but they often circulate within a closed loop of business management 
and operations. 
Over the next ten years, the process we see taking place in e-commerce will 
extend outwards to the ﬁelds of manufacturing, agriculture, and social governance. 
This process will create unimaginable wealth and opportunity.

How Gold Mines Are Created: The Personal Data 
Value Dilemma 
The new economy will be commanded by smart business, which will rely on the 
continued digitization of supply and demand. The demand side in this case is the 
consumer, and smart business needs their data. This is not a one-time process, but 
requires a continuous and stable stream of data. 
Over the past several years, I have received the same question many times: Why 
are Internet companies capable of harvesting and storing such massive stores of 
detailed consumer data? To answer that question, we must start with the invention 
of the mouse. 
For most of the history of computing, commands were input through a keyboard. 
If a command was entered incorrectly, the computer would not recognize it. It was 
a time-consuming and cumbersome process. People began to look around for an 
alternative. Some of them looked to car steering wheels as a possible inspiration. 
They wondered if an interface could be designed that would allow users to intuitively 
control their computers. 
In the 1960s, Douglas Engelbart (1925–2013) of SRI International turned his 
attention to the problem of computer interfaces. In 1964, after several attempts, he

1.6 How Gold Mines Are Created: The Personal …
21
Fig. 1.6 The earliest computer mouse and its inventor, Douglas Engelbart12 
came up with the world’s ﬁrst computer mouse. It was a box with wheels, something 
like a toy car, capable of sliding across the surface of a table. He termed it an “X–Y 
position indicator for displays.” He took his invention to the 1968 Fall Joint Computer 
Conference in San Francisco, where it came to the intention of industry professionals. 
Later, owing to the “tail” that trailed the device, people took to calling it a “mouse.” 
The nickname stuck (Fig. 1.6). 
The earliest mouse was a small wooden box. It used two metal wheels perpendicular to each 
other, connected to potentiometers that transmitted an X–Y coordinate to the computer. 
However, it was not until 1981 that the ﬁrst mouse was commercially available. 
From invention to widespread application required more than a decade of patience 
and innovation. That’s not uncommon, of course. Many of the greatest inventions 
of human history took a long time to be widely accepted. In 1983, both Apple and 
Microsoft launched their one mice, ensuring that they would be standard on future 
consumer computers. 
The mouse is one way that the Internet can learn about its users and convert their 
behavior into data. We only need to look back to the original name of the mouse—“X– 
Y position indicator for displays”—to get an idea of how that’s done. Basically, the 
computer records the position of the cursor on the screen, treating it as a coordinate 
system. The computer can identify and record the cursor’s position on an X–Y axis. 
The most common example will work here: a web browser opening a site. The 
website is on a server and the browser accesses its pages. There are two ways to 
record data in this architecture: one is to record user data in the server’s log, and the 
other is to record it through code on the page (JavaScript is often used for this). The 
website can record clicks, scrolls, and presses of the forward and backward keys in 
the browser. 
With a mouse, the most common behavior will be clicks. Those clicks are usually 
divided like this: clicks on hyperlinks, which take the user to a new page, or null clicks 
on content that doesn’t contain a hyperlink. Those null clicks might be unintentional 
or the result of the user mistakenly thinking that an image or text contains a hyperlink.
12 Photos is from SRI International. 

22

Data Equality: The Impact and Original Sin …
Those null clicks are not recorded on the server, though, but only by the scripts on 
the site. Why are they recorded at all? If someone notices a large number of null 
clicks, they can tell that there might be a problem with the design of the site. The 
part of the web page that attracts the most clicks is the most valuable piece of real 
estate, so administrators want to make sure clicks are not being wasted. 
As soon as you get online, your cursor is being tracked. This data generally 
includes: 
– URL 
– Click time 
– Time on page 
– Session ID 
– Session step 
– Referrers 
– Entrance 
– Exit 
– Session start time 
– Session end time 
– Time on site 
– Number of pages visited 
– User info from cookies. 
This is browsing data. In addition, consumers also generate search, transaction, 
and use data. If they make a purchase, a database will also store the name of the 
item or service will also be recorded, along with payment amount, user information, 
details of the item or service, and time of purchase. On streaming and gaming sites, 
the watch or play time, upload and download information, speed, and location of the 
users is also being recorded. 
By recording the movement of the cursor, Internet companies can track every move 
their customers make. All the behavioral data of customers browsing or purchasing 
items gather like sediment. In a traditional brick-and-mortar retail operation, it would 
be difﬁcult to track a customer’s behavior in the same way, and completely impossible 
to record the behavior of every customer. In ofﬂine retail, the cash register simply 
notes revenue and inventory. 
The granularity of the data that can be recorded online has reached unprece-
dented levels. We’re witnessing epoch-making change. The Internet has completely 
transformed the landscape of human data collection. 
In traditional terms, data was usually expressed in terms like 1, or 99%, or 0.5— 
that is, it came from surveys and calculations of the results. What we have today 
is completely different: an image, a short video, a text, or a microblog post can all 
become data.13 
13 These records are called data because they are stored in a database. After the invention of the 
database, people gradually began to refer to any information stored in a database as data. For more 
on this, see Chap. 8 of my The Peaks of Data (2014). CITIC Press.

1.6 How Gold Mines Are Created: The Personal …
23
The conversion of personal information to individual data is taking place on a 
large scale. Mobile phones are now capable of not only communication but also 
taking pictures, social networking, navigation, accessing websites, and paying bills. 
The creation of these functions is driving the collection of individual behavioral data. 
The more functions the mobile phone is given, the more data it can record. The more 
frequently we use our phones, the more we send our information to cloud servers. 
The explosive proliferation of individual data is the key to driving innovations in big 
data, which will take it from the theoretical to the practical. 
When the Internet was created in the 1990s, it was mostly devoted to news and 
corporate sites. Personal data accounted for 5% of all data at most. However, with 
the emergence of e-commerce and social networking, the majority of sites began 
collecting personal data. Conservative estimates now put the share of individual data 
at 90% of all Internet data. 
Now, data is mostly individual. Each user has their own data mirror image in 
the online space. Personal data has become a gold mine. That gold mine is the sole 
preserve of major Internet companies. Using this to their advantage, these companies 
are now sprinting towards a future based solely on proﬁts from data. The goal is to 
make all the data they harvest generate proﬁt or commercial advantage. 
How does data generate proﬁts? There are two ways: the ﬁrst is advertising and 
the second is credit. 
First, by recording the data that users are constantly generating through their 
actions on the Internet, companies can provide ﬁnely tuned, dynamic offerings of 
products and services in the form of advertisements. Second, Internet companies can 
evaluate their users with the same data, then offer them various ﬁnancial services. 
This business model requires humanity to completely give up on privacy. 
Once this data is generated by the user, it leaves their control completely and 
becomes the property of Internet companies. This is the greatest contradiction of 
this system: individuals do not control their own data. Although they are the ones 
furnishing Internet companies with information, they have no control over data 
collected. This is a very peculiar situation. 
Looking back, the word most often used in conjunction with descriptions of 
the Internet was “connectivity.” There was a drive to network computers together, 
increasing the number of nodes, increasing the number of users, increasing the 
number of websites… But today, no matter what methods they use, there are few 
barriers to connectivity between users. For example, a user on a desktop computer 
can connect to a user on a mobile phone, and messages from a QQ user will reach 
a WeChat user (both are Tencent products). Now, we have constant, cross-platform 
hyperconnectivity. 
When I talked about the seasons of the Internet, this hyperconnectivity represents 
the summer. The historical mission of connecting people has been completed; a 
new and vital ecology was forming. In July of 2016, Meituan’s CEO Wang Xing 
claimed that the Internet has entered its “second half.” In this second half, the focus 
has shifted from “connectivity” to “data.” Today’s Internet has become an advanced 
data harvesting and storage infrastructure. It matters little whether or not users have 
consented to having their data collected.

Data Rights: The Original Sin of the Internet Emerges 
When Spanish colonists arrived in Mexico in 1519, the aboriginal people were mysti-
ﬁed by their obsession with gold. After all, gold couldn’t be eaten, and, as a metal, it 
was useless for making tools or weapons. So, why did the Spanish travel around the 
world in frantic search of it? The aboriginal people of the New World had no idea 
that gold was a currency, with purchasing power. 
It has been estimated that Spain looted 2.5 million tons of gold from Latin America. 
The amount of silver plundered was even higher. Precious metal extracted from the 
New World helped build Spain into an imperial power. Spain was the ﬁrst “empire 
on which the sun never sets.” 
The gold of the New World was sent to Europe and they were repaid with slavery 
and disease. The indigenous people of the continent had no immunity to diseases 
like smallpox, which originated in Europe. Smallpox raged across South America, 
reducing the population by 90%. The mighty kingdoms of the New World crum-
bled one after another. Advanced civilization collided with backwards civilizations, 
resulting in the most inglorious pillage of human history. 
The public’s understanding of data is at the same level as the indigenous South 
Americans’ understanding of gold ﬁve hundred years before. Few people realize the 
value of data. Just as people ﬁve centuries ago could scarcely imagine a continent far 
beyond the horizon, few understand that we are creating a digital space parallel to our 
physical world, where data will be as valuable as gold, oil, minerals, or even land. 
Even if the larger public has not realized it, Internet companies are already plun-
dering data and building their reserves. This is what helps them to turn out their 
impressive annual reports. Although they may appear to be enriching society as 
a whole (and that’s true for anywhere in the world, East or West), there are few 
questions being raised about the source of their wealth. 
It is undeniable that Internet companies have brought value and convenience 
to the lives of many, but their use of data is also a threat. We can see examples 
already: the controversy with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, price manipula-
tion on e-commerce platforms, and algorithmic collusion on ride-sharing platforms. 
A particular concern is that AI, fueled by the data these ﬁrms are harvesting, will 
begin to replace workers. But this data is provided almost free of charge. In a way, it 
is like being killed by the ones closest to us. Our kindness is being repaid with harm. 
This is the paradox at the heart of our new digital civilization. It must be said that 
the harvesting of data was the original sin. 
“Many pelts make a beautiful garment.” “A mighty tower is made from many 
grains of sand.” These two idioms refer to building something great from small 
pieces, and qualitative versus quantitative change. They vividly describe the current 
situation with data. A grain of sand is insigniﬁcant, but many grains of sand go 
into the construction of the mighty tower. The more complete the data, the more 
valuable it is. Once you have enough high quality data, it becomes valuable. This 
is a basic truth. For example, if an investor gets the message, “Tomorrow, Alibaba 
stock will rise by 10%,” it’s valuable; if he receives an incomplete, fragmentary 
message—“tomorrow,” “stock,” “rise,” “percent”—it could be worthless.

1.7 Data Rights: The Original Sin of the Internet Emerges
25
In the same way, an individual’s data is of little value, but when combined together 
with the data of other individuals, it becomes valuable. To a certain extent, the more 
data you have, the more valuable it is. Data is like DNA, in this way. If you have a 
single genetic code from an individual, there’s not much you can do with it, but if 
you sequence an individual’s or a population’s entire genome, you have something 
very valuable. 
The most typical example comes from e-commerce platforms. Even if it’s an 
inexpensive item purchased off peak hours, there is still data being generated about 
the buyer and seller. 
To that consumer, generating data on the platform, the data has no value and no 
particular signiﬁcance. But once the consumer buys more products on the platform, 
and when the data about those purchases can be amalgamated with data from other 
users’ purchases, the value of that original point of data is magniﬁed. The platform 
has algorithms to watch what’s happening and begin to push targeted advertisements 
or merchandise offers to them. Advertising brings revenue, and so does increasing 
sales. According to ﬁnancial reports, advertising revenue once constituted 80% of 
Alibaba’s revenue. 
Alibaba is not alone there. Almost all Internet companies rely on advertising 
revenue for their survival. Baidu’s advertising revenue (the ﬁnancial report called this 
“online marketing”) in ﬁscal year 2017 was 73.2 billion Chinese yuan, accounting 
for 86% of total revenue. In the same year, Tencent’s advertising revenue increased 
year-on-year to 40.4 billion yuan. Traditional advertisers simply cannot be compared 
to BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent). State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, 
Film and Television (SAPPRFT) reported in 2017 that radio and television adver-
tising brought in a total revenue of 151.8 billion yuan, representing a 1.84% decrease, 
year-on-year. The situation in print media is even more startling. Online advertising is 
growing, while traditional media advertising is shrinking rapidly. The reason why the 
Internet giants are beating their traditional media competition is because of consumer 
data. They use their vast stores of data to virtually read the minds of their customers, 
controlling their purchasing, and achieving a precise match between supply and 
demand. That is how they attract advertising money and earn huge proﬁts. 
It would not be inaccurate to say that the past three decades of the development 
of the Internet has been dedicated mostly to perfecting advertising. BAT are actually 
nothing more than three massive advertising and gaming companies. Despite these 
ﬁrms declaring their massive stores of data, most of their consumers are still ignorant 
of the value of this information. Users have no idea who is using this data and what 
it might be used for. They certainly don’t know how many times this data is being 
copied, or where it’s being stored. 
There’s now consensus in the corporate world that data is an asset, but it’s only 
an asset to these Internet giants and not the people contributing the data, who might 
be harmed by its use. This is unfair. But Internet companies have repeatedly and 
skillfully used public ignorance of data rights to hide their plans and ambitions. 
First of all, Internet giants do not think of the issue of data rights as controversial. 
They believe that they have the right to collect and store data. Their position is that 
possession of this data gives them the right to hold, sell, or trade it. To them, the data

26

is dead until they breathe life into it by using it. These ﬁrms’ use of the data is what 
powers the Internet and what creates value for themselves. The public has never been 
given room to debate this consensus. 
But we need to challenge them. The public’s understanding of data rights must 
undergo transformation. 
In 1899, when Yan Fu (1854–1921) translated Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations and 
entrusted it to the Translation Department of the Shanghai Nanyang Public Academy, 
he speciﬁcally raised the issue of copyright. They agreed to pay 2000 taels of silver for 
the rights to his translation and a 20% share of all proﬁts from sales. This is regarded 
as the ﬁrst example in China of a copyright and royalties system. 
Before Yan Fu, there were few examples of authors being paid for their work. 
When it did happen, it was called “ink fees” and was usually reserved for things like 
writing epitaphs. There was no way for a Chinese intellectual to make a living from 
writing. 
During the Republican Era, writers and publishers in Shanghai took the lead in 
establishing a system of royalties and payment in exchange for rights. The establish-
ment of this system allowed intellectuals to make a living from writing and contribute 
greatly to Chinese society. Lu Xun (1881–1936) resigned from Zhongshan Univer-
sity in 1927 and stayed in Shanghai until his death. The only way he could make a 
living as a freelancer was because of royalties from his work. Research shows that 
royalties brought in 75% of his total income during that period.14 He was not alone. 
Many others relied on their royalties to live, including Mao Dun, Yu Dafu, and Guo 
Moruo. The establishment of a new system of compensating writers had far-reaching 
consequences. It produced the ﬁrst batch of urban intellectuals and opened up new 
literary territory beyond the feudal thinking that was a holdover from imperial China. 
For the ﬁrst time, authors took the state and the nation as topics, producing modern 
literature that deserved to be called as such. 
Recounting this history is not a call for a “digital royalty” system, since I recognize 
that data and literary creations are quite different. There is intellectual labor and 
creativity involved in writing, with a concomitant increase in compensation for works 
requiring more of either. Data is another matter entirely; data is simply a record; and 
its value is determined by accuracy. The more accurately data records a subject’s 
identity, traits, behavior, habits, and preferences, the more valuable it is. 
My point in talking about Shanghai in the 1920s is to point out that the royalty 
system created a new space for society and the market, and recognizing data rights 
has the power to do the same. 
Another example is the streaming industry. Chinese streaming sites used to host a 
large amount of unlicensed content, which helped increase the trafﬁc and popularity. 
Copyright became a major hurdle for the industry. In recent years, however, the situa-
tion has improved immensely. The platforms hosting unlicensed intellectual property 
have mostly been shut down, while the sites like iQiyi and Youku that policed IP have 
become industry leaders. When iQiyi made an initial public offering in March of 2018, 
its market valuation reached $30 billion within six months. If they had not exercised
14 Ye (2006).

tighter control over unlicensed IP, that would have been impossible. Investors would 
never have taken the leap on a platform that occupied a legal gray area. 
I believe that data rights should rest with the consumer and that collection of data 
must be done according to the law. Internet companies build the platforms that collect 
data, but the nature of the ﬁrms harvesting information is unimportant. The important 
thing is to know whose information is being recorded and what that information is. 
My point is that Internet companies need a better reason to collect data than simply 
recording our behavior. Users have a right to know how data is being collected; users 
have a right to make decisions about how data is being used; and users have a right to 
share in the proﬁt generated by that data. At present, the situation is as unreasonable 
as someone writing an autobiography, having it published without their consent, then 
being excluded from proceeds of its sale. 
This is what’s called the data dividend. For Internet companies, the data dividend 
was the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow—but now that they’ve reached it, they 
need to begin sharing the proﬁts with the users that have generated the data. 
It’s time for a data rights movement. This will be a civil rights movement for 
the digital space. It’s undeniable that we will see the same situation as we saw in 
the physical space, a repeat of the history of markets and the call for equal rights… 
Sharing the data dividend with users is simply respecting their fundamental rights. 
It can also be thought of as a form of market regulation. 
The continued obfuscation of data rights will inevitably become an insurmount-
able barrier to the development of the new economy and a new civilizational 
paradigm. Users will eventually realize the nature of the data they are depositing 
on Internet platforms—and it won’t be long before they demand their fair share. 
If data rights are not recognized, the interests of consumers not protected, and 
Internet companies continue to seize data, there will be a backlash. E-commerce 
will be regarded with increasing skepticism and distrust. This will serve as a brake 
on technological innovation and the globalization of the digital economy.

De-anonymized Tracking: The Metaphor 
of Skynet 
Abstract Sky-net arrived almost at the same time as the Internet. It was one of 
the earliest examples of what we call the Internet of Things, a human surveillance 
network, the smart city’s retina… Up in the sky, there was a pair of eyes looking 
down on us like a god. They’re better than human eyes, of course, with advanced 
playback and analysis functions. As its ability to discern objects improved, it could 
begin tracking and modeling objects below it (people and cars, for example) in real 
time. As Skynet crops up in more locations, it will change the way we behave in and 
organize our public spaces. 
2.1 In This World Nothing Can Be Said to Be Certain, 
Except Death, Taxes, and Data Collection 
In 1991, when the Internet was still an emerging technology, the intellectual elite of 
the world was thrilled by its potential as a method of collaboration. Meanwhile, in the 
Computer Laboratory at Cambridge, researchers were vexed by another issue. They 
had a single coffee machine and often found themselves going to ﬁll their cups, only 
to ﬁnd that it was empty. Their solution was to point a gray-scale Philips camera at 
the coffee machine, which would automatically take a picture every twenty seconds 
and upload it to the lab’s intranet. If anybody wanted to know the status of the coffee, 
all they had to do was call up the last image. 
They called their invention XCoffee. Despite the limited time invested in what 
was essentially a personal project, it would go on to change the world. What they 
had come up with was the ﬁrst example of real-time webcam surveillance. It was as 
if they had been suddenly granted legendary powers of clairvoyance. 
A camera connected to the Internet can observe and record a time and place 
where the viewer is absent, satisfying the human tendency to voyeurism. What was 
originally intended as a way to monitor the ﬁll level of a coffee pot also became 
a way to see who had emptied the pot without making a fresh one. It would also 
record other things, unrelated to coffee, like who had been at a certain location at 
a certain time. It could reveal things that would not otherwise be revealed. This is 
an example of the externality of information and data. You can begin to imagine

that there are things worth observing that are more interesting and important than 
a coffee machine. This sort of surveillance gives us the clairvoyance that humanity 
has always dreamed of.
In the thirty years after the Computer Lab coffee webcam, Internet-connected 
cameras spread around the world. The data is incomplete, but at least 14 billion 
webcams have been produced—two cameras to watch over every person on the 
planet. That number will grow by double digits over the next ten years. By 2020, the 
number of Internet-connected cameras in the world should reach 28 billion—four 
cameras to watch over every person on the planet. That means that they will exceed 
the number of laptops and even mobile phones.1 There has been no product in the 
history of small electronics that has spread so widely. 
These cameras are usually set up at a height of three to twelve meters, but they 
can also be hundreds of meters above the ground. They are artiﬁcial eyes, watching 
our cities and our societies, observing street corners and intersections, recording 
the goings-on in public squares and buildings. They have spread around the world, 
becoming universal. The reason for this is their size. They are small enough to be 
installed discreetly just about anywhere. Their sheer number is what makes them 
powerful—and the fact that they can be connected together. These Internet-connected 
cameras are the most widespread example of the Internet of Things. They have become 
part of the new infrastructure of cities. It’s a trend that shows no sign of letting up. 
2.2 “If It Happened in China, We Would Have Broken 
the Case Much Earlier” 
In June of 2017, the attention of many Chinese people was drawn to a startling 
and bizarre case in the United States. Zhang Yingying, a 26 year old student at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign went missing. The last known trace of 
her was surveillance camera footage of her getting into a black car on June 9th. The 
image was too low resolution to identify the license plate, but the police managed 
to cross reference the details about the vehicle color, make, and model in an Illinois 
Department of Motor Vehicles database. On June 15th, police executed a search 
warrant for the car. 
The driver admitted that he had picked her up, but had only driven her a few 
blocks. During the investigation, police discovered that he had visited a sexual fetish 
website that April and searched for content about abduction. In a recording made 
for the FBI by the suspect’s girlfriend, he was heard admitting to having abducted 
Zhang (Fig. 2.1).

case2 
On June 30, 2017, the FBI arrested and charged the suspect. Despite the evidence 
gathered by investigators from surveillance, Internet posting, and recordings, he still 
refused to plead guilty. Zhang Yingying was missing with seemingly no trace. The 
consensus in public opinion and the media was that she had been killed long before. 
In January 19th of 2018, federal prosecutors announced that they would seek the 
death penalty. 
While the unfortunate case of Zhang Yingying was still causing ripples in China, 
I was invited in September of 2017 to the Suzhou Industrial Park to help plan the 
core of the new smart city there. My impression of Suzhou was of a kind, beautiful, 
and well-developed city, typical of those in the Jiangnan region near Shanghai, but it 
was also experiencing growing pains. The city was being vigorously upgraded, but 
management was lagging behind. As a pioneer in similar planning schemes in the 
province of Jiangsu, the Suzhou Industrial Park was attempting to develop a “City 
Brain.” The subject of Zhang Yingying came up at a conference with members of 
the local public security apparatus. “I’ve studied the case,” a Public Security Bureau 
director told me. “If it happened in China, we would have broken the case much 
earlier,” he said with a smile. “Our cameras have the resolution to pick out license 
plates and the ability to track a car through the city. That’s critical evidence.” 
He quite accurately caught the issue that had caused a delay for American police. 
I can still recall his conﬁdent smile that day. I saw the reason for his conﬁdence 
when I turned on CCTV later that month and saw a documentary that was part of the 
Amazing China series. The September 18th broadcast used the example of Suzhou’s 
Skynet:

De-anonymized Tracking: The Metaphor of Skynet
China has built the world’s largest video surveillance network, linking more than 20 million 
cameras together in a network called Skynet. The goal of this project is to provide a set of 
eyes that can constantly watch over the people of the nation. 
A Suzhou policeman introduced the program like this: “Our coverage of road networks is 
extensive enough that we can usually pull feeds from anywhere a suspect might be located. 
Our task is to use this information to prevent crime. The use of AI and big data for policing 
is not yet universal, but we rank among the best in the world.” 
The line about there being “more than 20 million cameras” was repeated frequently 
around our dinner table the next day. If that was just the beginning, we wondered 
what the ﬁnal ﬁgure would be. Even if the cameras were small, there was still a cost 
for operation and maintenance. Looking at China’s population and area, how many 
would we really need? Should the number be capped? When comparing the situation 
in China with other countries, should we worry about the per capita or total number 
of cameras? What sort of problems might be reﬂected by the increase in cameras? 
Was it a case of the popularity of the Internet of Things paradigm? Was it simply 
a requirement for public safety? Or did the cameras represent a society in decline, 
where everyone tolerated the invasion of their privacy? 
When the topic of video surveillance comes up, the ﬁrst reaction of most people 
is anxiety or distaste. I feel that popular opinion mostly leans toward cautiousness 
and unease, although this is not accurately reﬂected in surveys. That’s one of the 
inherent problems with statistical science: by the time we realize that something 
needs statistical survey data, it’s already difﬁcult to obtain accurate information. I 
call this sort of paradox “statistical contradiction.” The longer you wait to get survey 
data, the less reliable it is. Instead of waiting, this sort of statistical information should 
be discovered as a project is put into practice, so that it can be incorporated into the 
implementation. 
We can ﬁnd some clues from other statistics and news reports. Many surveys 
questions and reports emphasize the increase in crime detection through surveillance, 
while downplaying the number of cameras. The reports and surveys that directly 
address the number of cameras are more reliable (Table 2.1). 
According to public reports, half of all criminal cases solved in Shenzhen were 
helped by evidence from surveillance video. In Guangzhou, the percentage of cases 
solved through surveillance went from 10.51% in 2011 to 70.96% in 2016. In Jinjiang 
in Fujian, more than 70% of criminal cases were cracked by surveillance video. 
“Spend a minute or two walking around and you will be seen by one of our high 
deﬁnition public security surveillance cameras,” the city engineer of Jinjiang said. 
That “minute or two” out in the street captured on camera has become an important 
way to solve crimes. In February of 2012, Wuhan police established the country’s ﬁrst 
ofﬁce devoted to investigating surveillance footage.3 In December of 2013, Shenzhen 
devoted their own branch within the Criminal Investigation Unit. 
According to a report from Statist, there were about 40 million surveillance 
cameras operating in the United States as of 2014. That means that on average, there 
was 1 camera for every 8 people. The United Kingdom has 5.8 million cameras,

2877 county level cities. There are six cities with populations over 100 million. Based 
on that and a ﬁgure of 20 million cameras, that means 1 camera for every 14 people. 
Thinking carefully about this phenomenon, we can see that there is something 
behind a tendency to voyeurism. Even stronger than that is the need for safety and 
security. 
The modern city is one where everyone is a stranger. It’s completely different 
from traditional rural society. This helps breed a certain amount of psychological 
insecurity among urban residents.

De-anonymized Tracking: The Metaphor of Skynet
How do we make a city safe? In 1961, American urbanist Jane Jacobs published 
her masterpiece The Death and Life of Great American Cities. In it, she talks about 
the idea that doors and windows of buildings should face the street. Houses facing 
away from the street makes the streets less safe because they lose the protection 
of their “eyes on the street.” She observed that neighbors can distinguish between 
people that belong on the street from those that they don’t recognize—and who might 
warrant closer supervision. Her concept of eyes on the street advocated for small-scale 
neighborhoods, developed with a variety of businesses. These small neighborhoods 
and businesses increase opportunities for people to meet, enhancing the safety of the 
area. 
Our present era is now quite distant from that of Jane Jacobs. Global cities are 
increasingly going down the path of large-scale urban development. Traditional 
neighborhoods are disappearing, the mobility of urban populations is increasing, 
and old connections are being slowly severed. Jane Jacobs’ idea of eyes on the street 
is increasingly untenable in our present age, when the value of every inch of urban 
real estate is soaring. 
Without many people noticing, artiﬁcial eyes on the street have become the new 
solution. Looking at this in a global context, most cities are building or reinforcing 
this key surveillance infrastructure. Unlike the eyes on the street that Jacobs advo-
cated—decentralized and independent human eyes—these new electronic replace-
ments can be networked into a uniﬁed architecture. Rather than a grassroots neighbor-
hood watch, surveillance cameras are a top-down solution. These cameras are being 
installed in cities by not only government bodies, but also by corporations, fami-
lies, and individuals. Skynet is not one-dimensional. It’s at least three-dimensional, 
having now penetrated the ecology of the city to the ﬁnest level. These cameras are 
now part of the “micromanagement” of urban space. 
2.3 Three-Body: The True Dimensions of Skynet 
A month after National Day, I was in Chaozhou in Guangdong, visiting a friend. 
He lived on the third ﬂoor of an ordinary apartment building. He had installed a 
camera downstairs, outside the entrance corridor. A small screen in his living room 
provided a live broadcast of goings-on below. He told me that he had done this to 
watch his motorcycle. If he caught someone approaching the motorcycle, he could 
shout at them through a speaker on the camera, “Zou me!”5 That would usually lead 
the stranger to ﬂee. 
This is another example of the “eye in the sky.” When I walked around Chaozhou, 
I found other cameras installed for the same reason. There were quite a few. Almost 
all of them were watching parking spaces, building entrances, or stairwells. They

invariably ended up capturing more innocent goings-on, as well. That had caused 
privacy disputes and there were even cases of neighbors suing each other.6 
In The Peaks of Data, I wrote about the precedent for this: 
Nextdoor is a social networking service for neighborhoods. To connect with other users, you 
need to live in the same area. The site was established in 2010 and currently covers 29,000 
communities in the United States. Where I lived in San Jose, there was a neighborhood 
called Bel Aire-Hillstone. In January of 2013, someone on the site reported a lost parcel. 
(Some might not be familiar with the American practice of leaving parcels at the door.) 
There were soon responses from other people that had experienced packages going missing. 
Someone suggested a locked parcel deposit box. Someone else suggested that they plant 
a fake parcel loaded with dog droppings. After some back-and-forth, the speciﬁc time and 
date of the packages’ disappearance was determined. It happened at four in the afternoon. 
Everyone promised to keep a lookout. Within a couple days, someone posted to say that they 
had seen a Porsche Cayenne in the neighborhood, seemingly casing the area for packages. 
A detailed description of the car was posted. Eventually, someone posted a picture of the 
Porsche, conﬁrming that it was the car responsible for the missing packages. Two more days 
went by and someone posted the license plate. Someone recognized the car and contacted 
the driver to ask if they were involved. The driver turned himself in to police the next day. 
I would call this crowdsourced crime ﬁghting. It’s carried out by the public and 
their eyes—an uncountable number of eyes, capable of capturing everything. Now, 
Nextdoor is trying to use their platform to wire all personal surveillance cameras 
together (Fig. 2.2). 
Many American companies and homes install their own surveillance cameras. 
When nobody is around, the cameras are capable of noticing irregularities and 
sending an alert to a mobile phone. Nextdoor wants everyone to connect their own 
cameras to their platform. The coverage of a single camera is limited but hundreds 
linked together can form an effective surveillance network that covers the entire 
neighborhood. If each family installed a digital video recorder, as well, everything 
the cameras captured could be stored in the cloud. This service is offered free of
6 Two parties surnamed Gu and Dong were neighbors in Tianhe in Guangzhou. Their apartments 
both had entrances off the same corridor. Since 2013, they have been involved in ﬁve lawsuits. In 
the ﬁrst case, Dong installed two cameras outside his apartment after ﬁnding his locks tampered 
with. Gu objected to this on the grounds that their family was being surveilled. They took the case to 
the Tianhe District Court, arguing breach of privacy. After mediation, Dong removed the cameras. 
The second case was triggered by Dong re-installing cameras. He placed a camera on the ceiling 
outside his door. This camera also covered public areas. Dong was not open to negotiation with his 
neighbor. They went before the Tianhe District Court again and, after mediation, Dong removed the 
camera. In October of 2014, Dong installed a doorbell camera on the inner door of the house. When 
the outer door was closed, the camera’s ﬁeld of view was restricted to the area directly in front of the 
door. But when the outer door was open, the camera would have a view of Gu’s entrance. Gu sued 
again. The Tianhe District Court ruled that the camera did not violate Gu’s privacy or portrait rights. 
An appeal was denied by the lower court. But Gu refused to accept the ruling and took the case to 
the Guangzhou Intermediate People’s Court. In September of 2015, they rejected the appeal, too, 
upholding the decision of the lower court. Gu once again refused to accept the ruling. The case was 
taken to the highest court in the province. They agreed to a retrial, disagreeing with the decisions of 
the two lower courts. They ruled that Dong must stop recording. See: “Home surveillance cameras 
lead to privacy infringement lawsuits,” by Shi Youxing in Procuratorial Daily, 2017, November 
8th.

Fig. 2.2 Building a smart society and crowdsourced crime ﬁghting 
charge, which means that if a household installed a camera, they would have access 
to video of the entire neighborhood. The effect of this is that the whole is greater than 
the sum of its parts. Connecting the cameras together on the platform also means 
that there are more eyes watching the street. 
These personal surveillance cameras can be compared to the private economy. The 
private economy is always more dynamic than the state sector. This is the second 
dimension of Skynet. 
There are “eyes in the sky,” but there are also “mobile eyes,” mounted at various 
positions on city buses, taxis, and private cars. This is a mobile Skynet. 
Take Hangzhou in Zhejiang and Linfen in Shanxi as examples… In 2014, 8,200 
buses in Hangzhou were equipped with four cameras each. That means that there 
were 32,800 cameras altogether.7 The two cameras mounted on the front of the bus 
were also capable of monitoring the bus lane for vehicles that shouldn’t be there. 
Photos of the vehicle could immediately be transmitted to trafﬁc police. According 
to reports, within ten days of the December 2016 introduction of the cameras, 230 
offenders had been captured in the bus lane by the front-mounted cameras.8 
The United States has a lower population than China and fewer cars. If the Zhang 
Yingying case had happened in China, would it have been so complicated to solve? 
Just comparing numbers, it seems simple enough. A friend in the Public Security 
Bureau told me about two actual cases he had encountered. They show the power of a 
mobile Skynet. One involved a trafﬁc accident in a remote area. The accident resulted 
in a death. There was no surveillance at the scene of the accident, but the police put 
many ofﬁcers on the case. Two weeks later, they turned up a dash-mounted camera 
video from a passing car and solved the case. In another incident, a car collided with

an electric scooter. According to surveillance footage of the site of the accident, the 
car had run the red light. But the car’s camera showed that the scooter had also run 
a light. In the end, both drivers were found to be responsible. If the driver of the car 
hadn’t installed a camera, they would have been found at fault. 
Cameras on vehicles have played a key role in determining accident responsibility, 
but have also been involved in solving other cases. In 2016, a woman at an intersection 
in Pukou, Nanjing was robbed by someone on a motorcycle. The suspect was clearly 
an experienced thief. He pinpointed the surveillance camera and kept his face turned 
away. But the police can be just as clever as the criminals. The Nanjing cop that took 
over the case was even more experienced than the robber. He reviewed surveillance 
and noted the vehicles that passed through the area around the time of the crime. He 
ran their plates and contacted the drivers, asking if they had dash cams. Sure enough, 
one of the driver’s had captured the incident on camera. The suspect was tracked 
down within a day.9 
The three-way intersection that the robber had chosen was not a coincidence. He 
had realized that passing cars would be the best way to hide his appearance. But he 
had not taken into account the dash cams of those passing cars. He took the cars to 
be not much more than scenery, but they turned out to be reliable witnesses against 
him. They were even more reliable than human witnesses, too, since they had the 
ability to play back the scene just as it had happened. If the criminal had realized 
that he was being recorded by passing cars, he would likely have never attempted 
the crime. 
These surface cameras are also part of China’s Skynet. According to the Ministry 
of Public Security’s Trafﬁc Management Bureau, there are more than 304 million 
cameras installed on cars as of June, 2017. Private vehicles accounted for 156 million 
of those. Vehicle cameras cost in the range of 300–400 yuan (around $45–60 U.S. 
dollars). They will likely become standard equipment on cars in the future. 
State Skynet, private Skynet, and the mobile vehicle Skynet are all part of Chinese 
Skynet’s “three-body.” If you add up all these cameras, it is in the hundreds of 
millions. 
I believe that we should actively work to create the conditions necessary to 
strengthen the network of the private Skynet. Networking cameras together makes 
them even more powerful. But this kind of networking must be different from the 
model offered by online streaming platforms. The Public Security Bureau should 
establish a registration system to keep track of cameras, especially in key locations 
such as corridors, shared exits, and parking lots. If a crime is committed, they will 
be able to use this database to trace a suspect’s path and provide evidence for his 
prosecution. The police will be able to contact camera owners, as they did in the 
above cases. If cameras were registered in a database, it would save police the labo-
rious process that’s currently required. Neighbors could also share video with each 
other to help community safety. In the future, car cameras will be networked into the 
system through the cloud, as well.

De-anonymized Tracking: The Metaphor of Skynet
2.4 What the Internet Can Learn from Skynet 
The construction of Skynet began in the 1990s, tracking the development of the 
Internet. At the beginning, the two collected data in similar ways. 
Skynet’s initial data collection method was simple, direct, and without permission. 
Cameras were installed indoors and outdoors and collected video 24 h a day. Anything 
that their lense captured was stored. Few people noticed the cameras and there were no 
signs to indicate that they were there. Without any awareness of them, how could the 
surveillance be deemed consensual? That is why I refer to it as “without permission.” 
Internet companies also carried out a similar collection without permission. If you 
use their website or install their mobile app, you are surrendering your data. There 
is no obligation to inform users of this, let alone ask their permission. As for where 
this data is stored, who’s using it, and what they’re using it for—the user has no say 
over any of this. 
The situation with Skynet was that it was recording public spaces in order to 
maintain public safety. It was simply recording what was happening out in the world, 
which, in principle, anyone has the right to do. That makes the lack of permission 
more understandable. On the other hand, collection of data by Internet companies 
was for commercial reasons. It was data about consumption habits and behaviors. 
The lack of consent to the data being collected is much less tenable than in the case 
of Skynet. 
It was also not Internet companies that broke with this system ﬁrst. In April 
of 2007, the city of Beijing adopted the Measures of Beijing Municipality for 
Administration of Image Information Systems for Public Security, which stipu-
lated that any collection of surveillance in public places must be indicated with 
a sign. The city began putting up bilingual signage in place with surveillance 
cameras, reminding individuals that their behavior was being recorded and to govern 
themselves accordingly. 
After 2007, most cities in China adopted similar practices. Signs saying “This 
area is protected by video surveillance” became ubiquitous. This was tantamount to 
seeking permission to record people. Entering into the space was to give approval to 
surveillance. To some degree, this honored the public’s right to privacy and disclosure 
of surveillance. 
Shortly after Google Maps Street View launched in the United Kingdom, they 
were challenged by a local human rights organization called Privacy International. 
The group ﬁled a complaint with the British Information Commissioner’s Ofﬁce 
(ICO), stating that despite attempts to censor the faces of pedestrians in Street View, 
individuals were identiﬁable in the more than 200 photos they had collected. Their 
request was that Street View be banned in the UK, although that was eventually 
denied. The IOC pointed out that taking pictures of people on the street was not 
against the law, unless it was done in such a way as to harass them. 
There have been similar problems in Japan. Street photographer Masato Seto 
frequently made pictures on Japanese streets and his images of subways had won 
him the prestigious Kimura Ihei Award. After the pictures were published, Seto was

2.4 What the Internet Can Learn from Skynet

sued by one of the women in them. He eventually lost the case. To avoid similar 
awkward situations and to deal with the dark side of the Internet, new rules were 
made. One of those rules was that any device capable of taking a picture couldn’t 
be operated in silent mode. If you take a picture with your phone, it will make an 
audible click that cannot be muted. A short time later, South Korea established similar 
regulations. 
The sound effect informs the subject of the photograph that their image has been 
captured. People still have the right to record images in public, but they must inform 
the other party. If you use the images for any purpose, you must seek the consent of 
the subject. This is done because the image might affect a person’s reputation, safety, 
privacy, or livelihood. 
Everyone is familiar with the Miranda Warning given by police when they arrest 
a suspect: “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against 
you in court.” Interrogation of a suspect is also a form of data collection. This warning 
is to inform the suspect that data collection has begun and that they should govern 
themselves accordingly. The Miranda Warning has become a global norm. 
If recording images and sounds follow these rules, then the collection of other 
types of data should comply, as well. However, Internet companies have ignored 
global norms. They are unwilling to give up data collection without permission. 
On January 3rd, 2018, Alipay placed on users’ ﬁnancial statement a checkbox to 
agree to their service agreement. One of the terms of this agreement was that users 
consent to data collection by Sesame Credit, Alibaba’s credit scoring program. The 
agreement also allowed Sesame Credit to transfer this information to third parties. 
Most people would click the “I agree” box without reading the agreement. 
The agreement attached to the annual statement was intended to allow users to 
expose their accounts and grow the Alipay brand, causing a chorus of angry voices. 
There was public anger at the practice of hiding privacy agreements. Some people 
went as far as to call it “data theft” (Fig. 2.3).

Left: “I agree to the Sesame Credit terms of Service” was checked by default on Alipay’s 
statement (partially enlarged). 
Right: The apology issued by the company on January 3rd, 2018. 
Alipay immediately apologized for their misjudgement. It was more than a 
misjudgement, though, since it violated China’s Cybersecurity Law, Standard on 
Personal Information Security, and other laws. The apology was about all they 
did, since there was no change to the policy. In March of 2018, Alipay was ﬁned 
180,000 yuan by the People’s Bank of China for “inadequate protection of consumers’ 
data, inadequate disclosure of information gathering, and improper use of personal 
ﬁnancial information.” 
In an interview conducted at the Fortune Global Forum on December 6th, 2017, 
Tencent CEO Pony Ma revealed something about his company’s facial recogni-
tion software. He said that although many companies had developed the capa-
bility, Tencent was far ahead of them. He revealed that there were more than a 
billion photographs uploaded to Tencent every day, with that number doubling or 
tripling on holidays. Most of the photos are selﬁes. Because people sometimes begin 
uploading selﬁes from a young age, Tencent can watch them grow up. That means 
that Tencent can predict their future appearance. The photos were uploaded for users’ 
own purposes, but Tencent used them to develop facial recognition software. 
On New Year’s Day of 2018, Geely chairman Li Shufu expressed his own concerns 
about data and privacy. He said: “Pony Ma has to be reading our conversations on 
WeChat. He can do as he pleases. This is a major problem.” This criticism touched 
on the very lifeblood of Tencent. They gave an ofﬁcial reply, stating that Tencent 
“does not save WeChat users’ chat histories and they are stored only on the device.” 
This reply seems to contradict what Pony Ma said. Tencent doesn’t save chat 
histories but does it save pictures uploaded to the platform? If not, then where do 
those billion pictures come from every day? 
On a Tencent website introducing its big data analysis capabilities, it claims to 
have 800 million user portraits. If they are not saving data, then how could they claim 
the capability of analyzing data? This is what it says on the ofﬁcial Tencent website: 
We offer real time statistical data analysis services for your applications, capable of moni-
toring performance, status, user behavior and segmentation. Our data visualization assists 
you in making key decisions. 
Based on Tencent’s 800 million QQ user portraits, we offer a complete, reliable solution to 
identifying your customers. 
We provide statistical analysis to fully integrate with any business scenario.10 
In simple terms, today’s Internet companies suffer from “multiple personality 
disorder.” They want to show off to potential customers their capabilities to analyze 
big data, but they also want to hide that from their own users, never revealing the 
source of their data. When they are confronted on data collection, they try to wriggle 
out of it, claiming innocence.

2.5 Fog Computing: The Battleground for Artiﬁcial Intelligence
41
Of course, these problems extend beyond Alibaba and Tencent. Toutiao, Sina, JD, 
and Baidu have all been charged by the Cyberspace Administration with violating 
rules about data collection and also being unable to justify the collection of this data. 
What the Internet needs to learn from Skynet is that the age of data collection 
without permission and notiﬁcation has ended. Internet companies must inform users, 
tell them what data is being collected, and get consent for its use. 
2.5 Fog Computing: The Battleground for Artiﬁcial 
Intelligence 
The public’s perception of Skynet is likely to experience a major upgrade. 
As I’ve already written, the idea is almost universal that mastering artiﬁcial intel-
ligence will be the summit of the next technological competition. Everyone realizes 
that this will bring major social change. In the future, people will realize that surveil-
lance cameras can be used for more than data collection, and the debate over them will 
extend beyond security and privacy. People will discover that Skynet is an important 
factor driving the development of AI. Skynet will become a battleground for AI. 
Information can be divided into three categories: images, words, and sounds. When 
it comes to human perception, the senses of sight and hearing are the strongest. The 
sense of sight takes up 80% of perception, with the remaining 20% given over to sound. 
Images are more plentiful in our lives than sounds, and we are more sensitive to them. 
The present goal with artiﬁcial intelligence is to replace humans with machines, which 
ﬁrst means giving them visual and auditory capabilities that will match our eyes and 
ears. To be more speciﬁc, the ordinary camera must become a smart camera. 
I believe that smart cameras, rather than robots, will be the ﬁrst large-scale appli-
cation of AI. The smart camera can not only record but also analyze images and 
sounds. Someday in the future, you might look into a camera and have it call out 
your name. 
Smart cameras are what will give people the sense that they have entered an AI age. 
Skynet is the largest source of image data. That makes these “eyes in the sky” a 
precious resource for developing AI. This AI will allow Skynet to transform from 
passive data collectors to analysts. 
There is another reason why the popularization of smart cameras is inevitable. 
Cameras must be networked online. This allows surveillance cameras to become 
a city’s retina. Skynet will become fully integrated, allowing each lens to be linked 
together, allowing data to be shared. All cameras in a city can be interlaced as a 
complete system that allows complete management of positioning, tracking, and 
management. This allows for uniﬁed adjustment and capability sharing. 
The biggest hurdle to networking cameras is storing and transmitting data. Video 
ﬁles are large. Compared to recording sound, the size of a video ﬁle is 100 times 
larger, and it would be 10,000 times that of a text ﬁle. The transmission of video ﬁles 
is a problem that the Internet must face. Sending videos now accounts for about 90%

of network trafﬁc. With millions of cameras running 24 h a day, the amount of data 
they produce could overwhelm the network. 
Digression: Project Dazzling Snow pushes surveillance networking forward 
The Chinese government has promoted the networking of surveillance. In May 
of 2015, the National Development and Reform Commission issued “Several 
Viewpoints on Strengthening the Constructruction of the Public Security Video 
Surveillance Network.” Their suggestion was that by 2020 all surveillance 
networks have “full coverage, complete networking capability, nonstop avail-
ability, and sophisticated controls.” These are goals to ensure public security, 
optimize transportation networks, serve city management, and innovate social 
governance. “In key public areas,” the report stated, “video surveillance must 
reach 100% coverage. In ﬁelds related to public security, networking must 
reach 100%.“ That was the reason for the Central Political and Legal Affairs 
Commission launching Project Dazzling Snow (also known as Sharp Eyes) in 
October of 2016.11 One month later, 80,000 surveillance feeds in Quanzhou, 
Fujian were connected to the Internet. That number included 30,000 feeds 
from the Public Security Bureau. In addition, there were 50,000 secondary and 
tertiary feeds from township-level governments, as well as campus and trafﬁc 
surveillance. As a result, Quanzhou was selected as one of the government’s 
Public Security Video Surveillance Construction Network Application Demon-
stration Cities, the only prefecture-level city in Fujian Province to receive the 
honor.12 
In 2011, Flavio Bonomi, former head of advanced R&D at Cisco, introduced the 
concept of “fog computing.” 
Fog can be all around us. To extend the metaphor, “fog” is the “cloud” at ground 
level. Fog computing is pervasive and ubiquitous. Cloud computing centralized data 
for processing, but fog computing gives devices on the periphery the ability to analyze 
data. That reduces the need for data transmission and dependency on central servers. 
The smart camera relies on this concept. It is not just a lense but also a computer 
capable of analyzing what it sees. They ﬂoat in the air like “smart dust.” At present, a 
trafﬁc surveillance camera transmits data back to a centralized server to be analyzed. 
This consumes network capacity and introduces lag. But if the camera has the ability 
to analyze data, it can make real time decisions about what it is recording. Once it 
makes its judgment, it can transmit the data to an on-site police ofﬁcer or send it
11 The project was born in Linyi, Shandong. Throughout 2013, it was implemented experimentally 
in Pingyi County, then throughout the entire city by 2015. Coverage extended even to remote rural 
areas. In 2016, the Central Comprehensive Management Ofﬁce and other departments implemented 
their own program to develop networked public security video surveillance applications and improve 
fully integrated crime prevention and control methods.

back to the central server. This reduces the demands on the central server and saves 
bandwidth. 
Given the way the system works, I prefer the name “edge computing” to “fog 
computing.” The trend is now toward empowering the edge of networks. More 
capability will be deployed to front-end equipment, along with key data. Back-end 
computing resources can be saved for more detailed integration and analysis. 
2.6 Using Pictures to Track Cars: Tracking the Trajectory 
of Hundreds of Millions of Vehicles 
Let’s return to the question raised at the beginning of this chapter: what made the 
Chinese police ofﬁcers I spoke to so conﬁdent that they could track the car in the 
Zhang Yingying case? 
A trajectory is a series of time-stamped locations. To track a moving object, you 
must know its trajectory. That has been known since ancient times. 
Humans discovered that the stars were in motion. Out of curiosity or fear, the 
ancients cast their gaze heavenward. Generations tracked the position of celestial 
bodies without the assistance of scientiﬁc instruments. They began to trace the 
trajectories of these objects. 
By tracing the trajectory of heavenly bodies, mankind discovered that there are 
365 days and four seasons in the solar year. That helped them to make important 
decisions about planting and harvesting, migration, coping with ﬂoods, and holding 
religious rites. In addition to the skies, mankind turned to the study of local fauna. 
They tracked these animals’ movements to learn the laws that governed their diets, 
migration, and reproduction. Meteorologists and ecologists studied the trajectories 
of hurricanes, too, and ocean currents. 
Digression: Tracking trajectories, data, and heavenly bodies 
The most basic way to chart a trajectory is to record the points through which 
an object moves. In 1605, Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) was looking down 
a chart showing the position of the sun and stars over the span of centuries. 
He had been trying for years to ﬁgure out laws of motion based on what he 
had observed. Whatever he did, the laws he formulated did not seem to match 
the charts. But one night, he realized that planets move in ellipses, rather than 
perfect circles. Suddenly, the data recorded by Nicolaus Copernicus (1473– 
1543), Tycho Brahe (1546–1601), and other astronomers made sense. Kepler 
was correct. He could ﬁnally chart the trajectory of heavenly bodies, which led 
him to establishing his three laws of planetary motion, laying the groundwork 
for Newton’s discovery of universal gravitation. That is how he earned his 
nickname: Legislator of the Stars.

Fig. 2.4 Motor vehicle license plate standard (GA 36-2014)13 
The movement of pedestrians and vehicles is the most apparent manifestation of 
urban dynamics. The volume of vehicle trafﬁc is larger than the volume of pedes-
trian trafﬁc. That is most obvious at intersections. With the help of license plates, 
it becomes easy to distinguish individual vehicles. If a city has enough cameras at 
intersections, Skynet can take a series of time stamped photographs. With the vehicle 
identiﬁed, as well as it’s driving speed, vehicle appearance, and driver characteristics 
to help differentiate them, we can track the trajectory of the vehicle, even if it falls 
outside the coverage of Skynet. 
When it comes to tracking vehicles, Skynet relies on nodes. These nodes refer to 
main intersections. These nodes are not synonymous with smart trafﬁc enforcement. 
In the case of the latter, photos are only taken from the rear of vehicles that violate 
trafﬁc laws, like running red lights. But the nodes capture more than 99% of passing 
trafﬁc. The only omissions are due to vehicles moving too quickly or being obscured 
by nearby cars. Unless lighting conditions are particularly bad, license plates can be 
identiﬁed in most pictures (Fig. 2.4). 
In 2017, various regions began promoting license plates with QR codes stamped in the upper 
left corner. These QR codes hold the same data as the number plate and are all unique. A 
QR code can be scanned much quicker than standard optical character recognition. It is an 
easy way for police to sort out fake plates or unlicensed vehicles. 
The work of license plate recognition is similar to the system to differentiate 
counterfeit bank notes. That is, there is a uniﬁed template. China has taken steps 
over the past two decades to standardize license plates down to the millimeter. In 
1992, the banning of letters I and O was designed to stop confusion with the numbers 
1 and 0. A law introduced in 2008 made it illegal to have a license plate frame without

at least 5 mm of clearance. License plate frames also cannot contain any Chinese or 
other characters, decorative patterns, or images. These regulations were to facilitate 
license plate regulation. 
The principle here is the same as the ﬁnish line of a race being moved toward the 
runners. It’s about making the ﬁnal goal easier to reach. AI improves but what it’s 
attempting to do also becomes easier. We are transforming our surroundings to make 
them more comprehensible to AI (Fig. 2.5). 
I and 1 are easy to confuse, as are Z and 2, S and 5, B and 8, and  D and O. 
As the technology for reading license plates has improved, companies have intro-
duced software that allows users to upload the image of a car and have its trajectory 
through Skynet nodes charted. You can see exactly where a car has traveled. 
In 2014, Taobao launched Pailitao, which allows users to take a picture of an item 
and have identical or similar products displayed on the site. Similar technologies 
have spread across e-commerce platforms, including JD and Amazon, as well as 
search engines, like Google and Baidu. Vehicles have recognizable features, and so 
do most items that consumers might train their cameras on. Those differentiating 
features could include symbols, brand names, or colors and shapes. The principle of 
identifying cars and products is the same. 
Starting in the second half of 2016, the technology for optical recognition of 
plate numbers began to be widely implemented. The transportation hub at Shanghai 
Hongqiao, integrating the ﬂow of airport, railway, car, subway, and bus trafﬁc, has 
used the technology, too. In 2016, they found that at least 70 vehicles were entering 
and exiting more than 100 times in a month; a single car was found to have entered and 
exited the hub 516 times. This pattern showed that the cars were not being used for 
personal trips. When contacted, most of the owners admitted that they were running 
illegal taxis.14 In May of 2017, Hongqiao Airport implemented a smart recognition 
system, so that vehicles coming and going no longer had to take a ticket but would be 
photographed and identiﬁed by AI. Violators could be found immediately (Fig. 2.6).

I don’t think it would hurt to expand and ﬂesh this out: if all the nodes and parking 
surveillance systems in the city were connected, there could be complete coverage 
of trafﬁc. Having worked in trafﬁc enforcement, I know that cars involved in the 
commission of crimes are frequently dumped in parking lots for long periods. In 
the future, this method of evading detection will no longer be feasible. The Public 
Security Bureau will be able to make use of universal coverage to track the trajectory 
of a car through the city. Nothing will remain concealed from investigators. 
However, linking nodes and parking systems is not simple. Parking lots and 
parking garages are under different management and ownership. That makes 
networking them quite difﬁcult. But the trend is clearly towards closer linkages, 
so this will be accomplished eventually. 
Getting a handle on vehicle trajectories also allows for better emergency manage-
ment. Police can ﬁnd themselves in pursuit of vehicles involved in crimes or acci-
dents. We’ve all seen the chase scenes in movies. But with Skynet, police can let 
their quarry get a bit further away, then plan for a safer point at which to make an 
interdiction. That will help avoid creating trafﬁc chaos, as well.

Fig. 2.7 A driver is nabbed for using their phone while driving 
Other than reading plates, the current system can also recognize characteristics 
like vehicle model, make, color, and the appearance of the driver. The 2016 General 
Requirements for Artiﬁcial Intelligence Trafﬁc Monitoring and Recording mandates 
driver photographs no less than 50 × 50 pixels. That has allowed the system to be 
applied to other things, like identifying drivers that are using a mobile phone. On 
June 1st, 2017, more than 140 nodes on expressways in Zhejiang began looking for 
distracted drivers. In the past, due to the difﬁculty of catching drivers in the act, these 
laws were hard to enforce. Within ﬁve days of starting the initiative, more than 4000 
drivers were charged.15 As you can see from Fig. 2.7, even if the vehicle is going 
over the speed limit, pictures will still be clear. 
A similar situation was faced with the issue of catching drivers not wearing seat-
belts. In October of 2016, Zhejiang launched a provincewide initiative to use cameras 
to catch those not buckling up. Images were captured by high-speed cameras at 
nodes and the pictures sent directly to trafﬁc police.16 In June of 2017, 942 cameras 
in Hangzhou gained this new capability. In less than a month, the system detected 
19,000 cases of drivers not wearing seatbelts.17 
As the technology advances, face recognition technology will also be brought into 
the equation, allowing the number plate and the driver to both be positively identiﬁed. 
We will be able to know who is driving a car, but we can also take a picture of an 
individual and match them to vehicles and times they were driving. 
That brings us to another question: if Skynet can trace the trajectory of a vehicle, 
can it trace the trajectory of a person? For the camera, a license plate and a person’s

face will be as easy to differentiate, so why couldn’t an individual’s path through the 
city be traced? 
The ability to track a person as they move through the city has been keenly 
anticipated by local governments around the world, and especially by their police 
forces. Although it was formerly impossible, today, it seems like it might be just 
around the corner. 
2.7 The Secret to Why External Hard Drives and Eye 
Drops Sold Out at the Same Time 
“He will kill anyone within ten paces/And will not stop till he has gone a thousand 
miles./Shaking the dust from his clothes, he goes into hiding,/To shroud in secret his 
person and his name.” So go the lines by the great poet Li Bai. He is describing a 
man that can take the life of anyone within ten paces. He cannot be tracked on his 
ﬂight of a thousand miles. He disappears without leaving a trace. We have no idea 
who he is. 
For a long time, it was hard to track someone’s movements. Before we entered 
the Information Age, comprehensive tracing of someone’s trajectory was virtually 
impossible. To track someone, you needed to rely on direct observation, by inter-
viewing eyewitnesses, or through a log book or diary. It was difﬁcult and frequently 
unreliable. 
With the advent of mobile phones, the situation has changed. The way our phones 
work, they have to stay in touch with a cellular station tower. These towers are linked 
together to form a network. Each tower operates on a particular frequency. As a 
phone moves, it switches between cell towers.18 Status updates, text messages, and 
phone calls are carried onto the network by the tower. The radius of each station’s 
coverage varies from hundreds to thousands of meters. From this, the approximate 
location of a phone can be determined. But the accuracy is dependent on the radius 
of coverage. You can tell the general area where a phone is, but not much more. 
But if cell tower station location and image searches from trafﬁc surveillance 
could be combined, we would have a “chemical reaction.” 
We can see that in a case from Zhangpu, Fujian. In 2010, police in the city began 
trying to ﬁnd ways to stop an auto theft gang operating in the area. In January of 
2012, they tried using surveillance to track a recently stolen car. They determined 
that the car had passed a particular intersection at 4:10 in the afternoon before going 
to Chaozhou, so they pulled records from a nearby cell tower, covering the time 
when the car would have been in the area. They noticed several calls made from a 
number in the coverage area to a Chaozhou number. The trajectory of the vehicle
18 As of September 2017, China has approximately 6 million stations, including 4.4 million 3G/4G 
stations. There are approximately 1.3 billion mobile phone users (142 million 3G users, 947 million 
4G users).

Fig. 2.8 Triangulating from cell towers can give a rough sense of a phone’s trajectory 
was established. By using data from the cell tower and trafﬁc surveillance, it wasn’t 
long before a suspect was arrested (Fig. 2.8).19 
In order to save on building more towers, telecommunications companies try to expand the 
coverage of cell stations. Coverage areas are roughly hexagonal, which leads to a honeycomb 
pattern. From the station a phone is connected to, its location can be narrowed down to one 
of these areas. 
Digression: The signiﬁcance of tracking trajectories goes beyond public 
security 
The applications of this technology go beyond cops and robbers. Studying the 
movement of people in the urban environment can help us to analyze other 
phenomena. If we can fully grasp how people are moving through the city, 
steps can be taken to avoid trafﬁc congestion and optimize transit. Advanced 
tracking can also tell us about the lives and behaviors of citizens, even down 
to the identities of the people they associate with. Some experts believe that 
despite the random or chaotic appearance of individual behaviors, they can be 
predicted with some conﬁdence. The success rate can rise as high as 93%.20

De-anonymized Tracking: The Metaphor of Skynet
Most smartphones now have built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) capabil-
ities and Wi-Fi, so we can go beyond cell tower triangulation. These methods are 
accurate enough to locate a phone down to meters. But this is data that can only be 
collected with the user’s knowledge and permission. 
This is one of the challenges of tracking phones. Here, the power lies in the hands 
of the user. 
If someone shuts their phone off, tracking becomes difﬁcult. That brings us back 
to the importance of Skynet. As we said before, it’s hard to walk for long in the city 
without being caught on a surveillance camera. Skynet doesn’t need express consent 
to capture your image, either. 
The UK was the ﬁrst jurisdiction to build a surveillance network, and they were 
also the ﬁrst to use facial recognition. This became even more pressing after the July 
7th, 2005 London bombings. In that attack, four British Al Qaeda members exploded 
bombs in a suicide attack on three London Underground trains and a double-decker 
bus, killing 52, injuring more than 700, and paralyzing the transit network. Police 
spent hours combing through footage from the hundreds of cameras inside stations 
and thousands mounted on the street. It took ﬁve days to locate the four suspects. It 
came down to hours of staring at screens.21 
When hard drives and eye drops were sold out in stores across Nanjing in 2012, 
nobody would have guessed that a similar effort was taking place, with police 
collating and then analyzing hours of video footage to solve a crime. This has become 
something of a legend in police circles in China. When I worked in Nanjing in 2017, 
I learned some things that few know about the case. 
It started with a robbery on Heyan Road on January 6th of that year. The culprit 
had gunned down and robbed a man that had just gone into a bank to withdraw 200,00 
yuan (about $30,000 USD). The details of the case reminded veteran police ofﬁcers 
of Zhou Kehua, also known as “God of Death,” a wanted criminal, at large for eight 
years, and known to be involved in at least eleven murders. 
The modus operandi was quite similar to previous crimes that Zhou Kehua had 
committed, so police surmised that he must be at large in Nanjing. They started 
making a citywide search for Zhou, but also began pulling surveillance footage from 
across the city, attempting to determine what his trajectory might be. 
The Public Security Bureau copied surveillance footage to thousands of hard 
drives that were distributed to ofﬁcers. Within a day, Nanjing stores had been stripped 
of external drives. The police went through the footage frame by frame, scanning 
faces. When they couldn’t take it anymore, they leaned back to put in eye drops. The 
search would continue until the suspect was taught. 
A similar thing had actually happened in Changsha between December of 2009 
and June of 2011, when Zhou Kehua was being sought for three crimes he had 
committed in the city. Kuang Zhengwen, then head of the team poring through 
footage at the Changsha PSB recalls that they had 1,000 of their members going 
through hundreds of thousands of gigabytes of surveillance over the space of two 
months. “It would be the same as every ofﬁcer watching a hundred movies in a
21 Knight (2005). 

2.7 The Secret to Why External Hard Drives …
51
week,” Kuang Zhengwen recalled. He would retire to his ofﬁce in the evening and 
sort through footage that had been ﬂagged. He would study these scenes intently, 
scanning the screen for anything suspicious. During that time, he would only sleep 
two or three hours a day. In the morning, he would rush out to any locations identiﬁed 
in the footage, making measurements, and investigating. It took three months before 
Kuang Zhengwen ﬁnally had a clear frontal photo of Zhou Kehua. This was a major 
break in the case. In 2017, Kuang was named to a list of “China’s Top 100 Criminal 
Investigators.” 
Nanjing police were able to determine that Zhou Kehua had arrived in the city 
at least twenty days before the crime and had frequented the area around the bank. 
In the following days, he had traveled on buses and bought daily necessities at a 
supermarket. However, just like in Changsha, by the time they began tracking his 
trajectory, Zhou had already left town. 
A similar search was staged in the United States in the wake of the Boston 
Marathon bombing. On the afternoon of April 15th, 2013, two bombs exploded 
at the site of the race, killing three people and maiming 183 others. The police 
immediately began working on footage, trying to ﬁgure out who might be respon-
sible. Unlike in the Zhou Kehua case, social media usage had progressed a bit by 
the Boston Marathon bombing. Thousands of people had been taking pictures at 
that moment. So, in addition to watching footage from the surveillance network, 
the police also had to comb through video and images from thousands of phones 
belonging to people that claimed to have seen the suspect. 
Finding clues was down to cops watching screens. A team was set up to watch 
videos around the clock. In one case, an ofﬁcer watched the same video 400 times. 
That effort, with the help of eyewitnesses, helped the police ﬁnd a suspect three days 
later. They were able to ﬁnd a clear picture of him on surveillance video (Fig. 2.9).22 
Top: Images of two suspects taken from surveillance at the scene. 
Bottom left: Front and proﬁle image of the bombing suspect. 
Bottom right: The ofﬁcial ID photos of the suspect, which facial recognition software did 
not turn up.23 
With a picture of the suspect, shouldn’t it be possible to compare it to their 
database with facial recognition software? Afterwards, the police realized that they 
had driver’s license pictures of both suspects on ﬁle, but they didn’t turn up in any 
searches. The facial recognition software was essentially useless. 
Without any high-tech recourse, the police turned to old-fashioned methods: press 
conferences, publishing pictures in newspapers, and offering rewards. In the end, a 
relative of the two suspects recognized their faces and provided police with their 
names. 
Here, we’ve seen stories about manual surveillance video searches from China, the 
UK and the United States. At this time, surveillance networks were simply eyes in the 
sky, without any intelligence. The situation today is very different. There are far more

De-anonymized Tracking: The Metaphor of Skynet

cameras, generating even more footage, but they now send their recordings to the 
cloud, where they can be easily downloaded for analysis. If it happened today, a case 
like Zhou Kehua’s would not require that surveillance be distributed on external hard 
drives; the footage could be easily pulled from the cloud. The practice of manual 
searches of footage is also a thing of the past, as facial recognition software has 
greatly improved. There won’t be another run on external hard drives and eye drops. 
How would the killer in Li Bai’s poem fare? He wouldn’t be able to evade capture 
by ﬂeeing thousands of miles or hiding his identity. The next question to ask is: How 
useful is face recognition? Will the system ever be capable of identifying a human 
face as easily as it identiﬁes a license plate? Will we be able to give Skynet a face 
and have it give us an identity and location? 
If we can do that, what changes will we see in social management and business? 
Is a future of advanced facial recognition what we have to look forward to? What 
will be the ultimate signiﬁcance of this technology? 
In fact, AI for facial recognition has been going on for six decades. But, dear 
reader, I leave that story to the next chapter.

Chapter 3 
The Face and  AI  
Abstract Our faces have become an entrypoint for artiﬁcial intelligence. The 
portraits you post of yourself on social media will be saved, transmitted, analyzed, 
and processed countless times in the cloud. Nobody will tell you this or ask for 
your permission. There are processes that nobody notices. The seeds of AI for facial 
recognition were planted in Silicon Valley and they blossomed into the world. This 
chapter will explain how that happened. 
In March, the peach trees ﬂower, and in September the chrysanthemum blossom. Each waits 
patiently for its time to come.—Chinese proverb 
In this chapter, we will travel back through the history of facial recognition, exploring 
how this tidal wave formed from a modest wake. 
Unique features and peculiarities are common in the natural world. Nature never 
tires of crafting these differences, like in the lines of leaves or in the pattern on a 
palm. They can be so minute as to not appear to the naked eye, requiring specialized 
tools. But people can tell faces apart quite easily. More than a hundred billion people 
have lived on Earth,1 but no two of them had perfectly identical features. 
The face represents ourselves. It is also the way we express ourselves. Subtle 
changes in facial expression can convey nearly every emotion we might feel. This 
adds to the mystery and profundity of the human face. 
This is why the human face has always fascinated artists. From Ancient Egypt’s 
Sphinx to Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa to Munch’s The Scream to modern photography, the 
face is the eternal theme of artists. The face is also a way for the artist to reﬂect other 
things. English artist and critic John Berger (1926–2017) summed it up like this: 
Whatever the painter is looking for, he’s looking for its face. All the searching and the losing 
and the re-ﬁnding is about that, isn’t it? And ‘its face’ means what? He’s looking for its 
return gaze and he’s looking for its expression—a slight sign of its inner life.2 
1 American demographer Carl Haub believes that before the adoption of agriculture pushed out 
hunter-gatherers, that global population would have hovered around ﬁve or ten million. According 
to the censuses that were irregularly carried out in the ﬁrst century AD, the global population can 
be estimated at around 300 million. Putting a relatively high birth rate on these ﬁgures, we get an 
estimate of around 106 billion people have lived on Earth. See: Xuefeng (2001).

The Face and AI
I understand the power contained within the human face, too. I have learned some 
of this from experience presenting and attending lectures. Any set of slides should 
contain a human face, preferably smiling. There is nothing more enticing or warm 
than the sight of a human face smiling back at us. 
Mankind long ago recognized that the face is the most important, most funda-
mental, and most convenient way to recognize each other. Naturally, making realistic 
faces became an early challenge for computer graphics; in the age of AI, recognizing 
faces has become a key part of developing machine vision (this is also called computer 
vision). In both applications, development started with photographs. It’s interesting 
to consider what came before the photograph, though: portraits drawn or painted by 
artists. 
3.1 
Photographs Are the Key: Building the Identity Society 
Painting is also a way to record things. Compared with writing, it can be a more 
perceptive medium. If we take Along the River During the Qingming Festival, The 
Night Revels of Han Xizai, or the  Last Supper as examples, we can see that artists can 
record social norms, customs, and daily life, as well as pursuing esthetic perfection. 
Before we had photography, artists left a record of our life and times. 
Truly great painters were rare; having a portrait painted was a great luxury. 
Whether in Occident or Orient, portraiture was restricted to monarchs, nobles, and 
military heroes. Seeking the ﬁnest and most accurate portrait possible, the Qianlong 
Emperor (1711–1799) even sought out the Italian Jesuit painter Giuseppe Castiglione 
(1688–1766). In rare cases, the privilege was afforded to members of other groups, 
including courtesans and fugitives. There is even a story about a portrait changing the 
fate of two nations. The subject of that portrait was a woman named Wang Zhaojun. 
Emperor Yuan of Han was looking for a concubine and had the painter Mao Yanshou 
sketch the candidates to save himself time on the process. The candidates bribed the 
painter to hide their defects. But Wang Zhaojun refused. Mao Yanshou deliberately 
painted her in an unﬂattering way. She was never visited by the Emperor and her 
beauty was only discovered when she was selected to be sent to the Xiongnu as a 
concubine as part of a peace treaty. When Emperor Yuan of Han realized what had 
happened, he killed Mao Yanshou in a rage.3 
Emperor Yuan of Han might have missed out on the beautiful concubine. But 
the Xiongnu appreciated her. They felt as if the Emperor must put great stock in 
the treaty. Wang Zhaojun understood what was required of her and she fulﬁlled her 
mission. After Wang Zhaojun joined the Xiongnu rulers’ household, the borderlands 
were peaceful for decades.
3 This story comes from Notes of the Capital of Chang’an, written by Ge Hong in the Jin Dynasty. 
It’s a historical record of goings-on in the capital of the Western Han. 

3.1 Photographs Are the Key: Building the Identity Society
57
A portrait can change history. The literati of past dynasties said it, too. There are 
even poems about it, like the matchless wisdom of Wu Wen, who advised that a 
painting was worth its weight in gold.4 
As I said, fugitives were also sometimes the subject of portraits. When the rulers of 
a nation sought a criminal, they would commission a portrait to put up in key locations, 
so that the ofﬁcers of the law would know who to watch out for. In Chronicles of the 
Eastern Zhou Kingdoms, Feng Menglong (1574–1646) recorded a case like this. In 
522 AD, King Ping of Chu ordered a portrait to be painted of the famous general Wu 
Zixu. He was trapped in the city. The fear turned his hair white overnight, which made 
his portrait inaccurate, allowing him to slip out undetected. This is a very popular 
story in China. 
There is a similar plot in Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Cao Cao attempted 
to and failed to assassinate the warlord Dong Zhuo, who immediately ordered that 
documents and portraits of the fugitive be distributed.5 It reminds us that this sort 
of portrait of a fugitive was the birth of facial recognition. The hunt for criminal 
suspects still relies on this method, although photographs have replaced paintings. 
Photographs are what made computer facial recognition possible. 
Frenchman Louis Daguerre (1787–1851) invented photography in 1839. He used 
a copper plate with a photosensitive silver layer to capture and ﬁx images. This laid 
the foundations for modern photography. He called this “writing with light.” It gave 
birth to a new age, where a moment or a life could be “reborn” in the form of a 
photograph. 
The process caused a sensation. It was unbelievable that a moment could be 
frozen in time, and even reproduced endlessly. It was nearly unbelievable. A paper 
in Leipzig wrote: “To try to capture ﬂeeting mirror images is not just an impossible 
undertaking, as has been established after thorough German investigation; the very 
wish to do such a thing is blasphemous.”6 
Photography provided mankind with something to rival writing and painting. It 
was a new frontier in the ways that we could record and preserve moments in history. 
The ﬁrst thing that photographers aimed their lenses at were human faces. Many 
were eager to have their images preserved for posterity, so there was a fashion for 
portraiture across Europe and the United States. In 1860, Queen Victoria sat for 
her ﬁrst photographic portrait. The image sold more than 500,000 copies across the 
country.7 That was only the beginning, though, as the technology steadily improved.
4 See: “Ming Fei” by Wu Wen, a Qing Dynasty poet. 
5 Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms and Romance of the Three Kingdoms are not quite 
accurate. The descriptions in them of drawing portraits of wanted men are not quite accurate. 
Researchers have concluded that this practice was not widespread until the Ming and Qing. The 
speciﬁc phrase to describe it ﬁrst appeared in a history of the Ming Dynasty. Before that period 
(1368 to 1644) lack of paper and printing technology limited the circulation of these sorts of images. 
The invention of commercial paper production by Cai Lun, an Eastern Han ofﬁcial, did not take 
place until 105 AD, so it’s very likely the story of Wu Zixu’s portrait was fabricated.

The Face and AI
By 1888, Kodak had invented commercial ﬁlm, reducing the cost of photography, 
and opening up portraiture to a new audience, which ﬂocked to newly opened studios. 
At this time, the West was reaching the climax of its Second Industrial Revolution. 
These advanced societies of the West glowed from the bright incandescent bulbs that 
began to be put up in their cities, and they seemed to roar with the sound of machinery. 
It was a new age. In the Technological Revolution being undergone, establishing 
identities became increasingly important. In an agricultural society, people are mostly 
conﬁned to their homes and the land they cultivate. They rely only on their plot of 
land. They live and die close to that land. For them, simply having a name is enough 
to identify them. But an industrial society is much larger. There comes division 
of labor. A worker is no longer tied to the land, either. A worker’s labor, welfare, 
mobility, safety, and ﬁnances all rely on establishing identity. To do that on the basis 
of a name alone, it would be hard to determine who is who. There is no way a state 
could manage its population. 
Photographs began to be used for personnel ﬁles. They became a new management 
method, providing managers with a way to ﬁx someone’s identity. Faces became the 
key to determining identity. This was a huge advancement. During the First World 
War, governments of Western states began to compel citizens to submit photographs 
for their records. Portraits became key to handling various documents. This collection 
of portraits from citizens became the basis for facial recognition decades later. Even 
now, the biggest customer for facial recognition technology remains governments. 
That is true around the world. 
Face recognition is identity based on biometrics. But face recognition is not 
the most mature or most accurate biometrics identiﬁcation technology. Although 
collecting and processing of ﬁngerprints was complicated and time consuming, 
advances in optical scanning technology had improved the process. But in contrast, 
collecting photographs was much quicker. Portraits began to pile up in archives. 
Here, we see how the track was paved for facial recognition. 
3.1.1 
Wandering Out of Silicon Valley and into the Geometric 
Age 
The earliest research into facial recognition technology was done in Silicon Valley. 
In 1960, artiﬁcial intelligence expert Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe (1921–1995) helped 
found Panoramic Research, Inc. (PRI), funded in part by the Department of Defense 
(DoD), charged with researching facial recognition. At that time, the funding for 
artiﬁcial intelligence was coming mostly from the DoD and intelligence agencies. 
The problem set for PRI was very clear: give a photograph of an individual to 
a computer and have it ﬁnd all matches in a database, making the job of manual 
comparison quicker. 
The reason why the DoD and intelligence agencies wanted the capability was to 
help them in keeping faces attached to identities. If someone committed a crime, then

changed their name and traveled to a remote jurisdiction to apply for a new identity, 
new documents could be issued to them—the same face but a different name. 
Bledsoe proposed using geometric features of human faces to differentiate them. 
This laid the foundation for the subsequent two decades of research. 
The geometric method was to measure the position and size of various features on 
the face. The size, location, distance, and ratios could be used to recognize the face. 
This requires a lot of manual assistance. The ﬁrst step is to mark the pupils, corners 
of the eyes, hairline,8 and other key points on a face. After that, various calculations 
were made about the width of the mouth, the distance between edges of the eyes, the 
distance between pupils, etc. These ratios and distances were used to compare faces. 
Bledsoe was later selected as the chairman of the American Association for Artiﬁ-
cial Intelligence (AAAI). He kept pushing research forward but recognized that facial 
recognition was a major challenge: a person’s face in different photographs might 
be at different angles, completely changing the geometric measurements recorded 
from each one. His method was to analyze silhouettes. It’s a principle similar to 
silhouettes in Chinese folk art. Bledsoe drew the silhouette as a contour line, took a 
point as reference, and compared it to the same point on another image. Compared to 
viewing the face from the front, the silhouette recognition system was rather crude, 
producing a lower rate of recognition. There could be additional factors to consider, 
including light intensity, angles, facial expression, and changes with age. 
In 1969, three Japanese scientists announced that they had created a program 
capable of determining whether a picture contained a face. In other words, they 
could pick a face out of a complex image. In 1970, a Stanford University researcher 
took things another step forward: he was able to extract the face from pictures. In 
1973, Takeo Kanade (1945–) announced that he had identiﬁed 15 faces in 40 photos 
of 20 people.9 This was the best result achieved at the time. Takeo Kanade became 
a key ﬁgure in the Geometric Age (Fig. 3.1). 
When confronted by two photos of the same person, the computer could determine if they 
were the same person by identifying key points. 
Generally speaking, this early facial recognition, rather than a process of artiﬁcial 
intelligence differentiating faces, was computer-aided manual facial recognition. 
Research into facial recognition showed it to be a very difﬁcult proposition. Although 
each face is usually composed of the same features, the combination of these features 
can be almost inﬁnitely varied. Just as no two snowﬂakes are the same, neither are 
two human faces. The difference between human faces and the diversity is amazing. 
Even Solomon Shereshevsky (1886–1958), the greatest mnemonist of the twen-
tieth century, struggled with this task. He could memorize extremely complex mathe-
matical formulas, huge matrices, and even long portions of texts in foreign languages. 
In one experiment, he was able to recite a list of 70 items from memory. If he heard 
something once, he could repeat it, front to back and then back to front. He had to 
admit that he couldn’t remember faces:
8 More speciﬁcally, this refers not to the hairline but the part of the hairline that is the lowest on the 
face.

The Face and AI
Fig. 3.1 Eight geometric features facial reognition relied upon in the 1970s10 
They’re so changeable. A person’s expression depends on his mood and on the circumstances 
under which you happen to meet him. People’s faces are constantly changing; it’s the different 
shades of expression that confuse me and make it so hard to remember faces.11 
A face is hard to remember because its characteristics are hard to accurately 
quantify. I asked Wang Feng, a Chinese mnemonist, famous for recalling 300 digits 
from memory, for his opinion on this. He told me that numbers and words are easy to 
memorize because of their composition: a number is nothing more than a combination 
of digits from 0 to 9, and words are limited to a particular set of characters. These are 
easily encoded by our brains. The human face is more of a challenge. There are nearly 
inﬁnite possibilities in the arrangement of features. It is very difﬁcult for us to encode 
a face into our memory. We might recall that someone has a large face, wide set, 
large eyes, double-folded eyelids, thick lips, etc. but these are qualitative rather than 
quantitative statements. That leads to challenges recalling and recognizing faces. 
From this, you can see what the Geometric Age was all about: the machine was 
capable of quantifying the human face in such a way as to give us the data necessary 
to recognize them. The calculations required were beyond the capabilities of the 
human mind. 
By the late 1980s, new methods began to appear, but facial geometry was still 
the basis. That meant that the process still began by ﬁnding the position of the eyes, 
determining the area of the face, converting the image into grayscale (color does not

come into the calculations), then extracting various features to compare to images in 
a database. 
Computer scientists in the 1960s had already ﬁgured out that the key to facial 
recognition was isolating features. If computers were capable of doing it themselves, 
could we solve facial recognition? Researchers began moving from the method to 
the tools, working on developing AI capable of doing just this (Fig. 3.2). 
Steps in facial recognition: 1. Get a photo. 2. Determine position of eyes, then crop and 
convert to grayscale. 3. Convert image into a form that can be placed in a template that the 
software can recognize. 4. Compare template to images in the database. 5. Output results. 
3.2 
Can Machines Learn?: The Struggle for Artiﬁcial 
Intelligence 
So, if we say that photography solved the problem of recording and facial recognition 
makes use of these recordings, then artiﬁcial intelligence is the way that we can make 
automation of facial recognition an automatic process. 
Artiﬁcial intelligence as a ﬁeld of research emerged from Dartmouth Summer 
Research Project on Artiﬁcial Intelligence, a 1956 summer workshop at Dartmouth 
College, organized by John McCarthy (1927–2011). At the time, McCarthy was still 
a year shy of his thirtieth birthday and only an assistant professor. His insistence on 
the title for the emerging ﬁeld—artiﬁcial intelligence—is the reason we still use that 
name today. 
As the name suggests, artiﬁcial intelligence is the synthesis of human intelligence 
with computers. The fact that it implies machine intelligence might replace human 
intelligence has led to disputes. 
When the ﬁeld was conceptualized, there was the belief that machines could be 
given logic, reasoning abilities, and a degree of intelligence that would allow them 
to assist or replace humans in making certain judgements. For that reason, mathe-
matical logic was the focus of early research, with the idea that this artiﬁcial intelli-
gence could solve theorems. However, it was later deemed that this was not sufﬁcient. 
Edward Albert Feigenbaum (1936–) changed the focus of determining whether or not 
a machine was intelligent from formal reasoning to an emphasis on knowledge. From 
that point on, with the support of researchers taking up his viewpoint, AI entered a 
new age focus on both logical reasoning and knowledge. Feigenbaum won the ACM 
Turing Award in 1994 and is often called the “father of expert systems.”

62

The Face and AI
However, mankind soon discovered new paradoxes in artiﬁcial intelligence. 
Expert systems focus on specialized knowledge, drawn from a professional ﬁeld, but 
human knowledge is boundless and constantly updated. Computer scientists must 
summarize knowledge and teach it to computers. This is a never ending process. 
Soon, a new question arose: Can we have a machine that learns by itself? If so, how 
would that be done? 
There were 20 participants in the Dartmouth Summer Research Project work-
shop, including IBM’s Arthur Lee Samuel (1901–1990). In 1952, IBM had released 
the IBM 701, the ﬁrst commercial scientiﬁc computer and its ﬁrst series produc-
tion mainframe computer. A short time after its release, Samuel developed the ﬁrst 
computer checkers program. The program was proof that computers could not only 
process data but also show a certain degree of intelligence. IBM’s stock rose 15% 
on the program’s release. 
Samuel continuously improved his checkers AI. He programmed a search tree 
of board positions that could be reached from the current state, but he also wrote 
programming that would allow the program to optimize its choice based on memo-
rization of positions it had already seen. Samuel believes that machines would one 
day use a learning process that would allow them to achieve an intelligence similar 
to human intelligence. In 1959, he proposed the concept of machine learning. 
Samuel believed that machines were capable of learning, and his checkers program 
was proof. But skeptics pointed out that checkers is a relatively simple challenge and 
limited in scope. Mathematicians proved that as long as both players played a perfect 
game that the result would be a draw. The problems that mankind hoped AI could 
tackle were more complex than checkers. It was difﬁcult to replicate the limited 
success of the program (Fig. 3.3). 
Fig. 3.3 Samuel plays checkers against an IBM computer

3.2 Can Machines Learn?: The Struggle for Artiﬁcial Intelligence
63
The checkers program Samuel created defeated many human players. Compared to chess and 
Go, the defeat of human champions by a computer came very early. The Chinook program 
developed by the University of Alberta in 1989 defeated human champion Marion Tinsley 
(1927–1995) in 1994. In 1996, the ﬁrst human chess champion was defeated by AI, and the 
turning point came in 2016 for a Go champion. 
The debate over whether or not machines can learn has divided researchers into 
two camps. 
The ﬁrst school is behind what could be called Conventional AI, attempting to 
imitate in a machine the intelligence of humans. This school believes that intelligence 
is unique to the human mind, so AI can only be achieved by mimicking it. To develop 
intelligence in a machine requires giving computers thought processes similar to our 
own. 
The other school is behind Computational Intelligence. They believe that machine 
intelligence does not necessarily need to mimic human intelligence. For example, 
birds and airplanes both have wings, but they operate differently, and one is much 
faster than the other. The idea is to develop the computational systems of existing 
computers, using math and logic to construct rules for them, which might allow them 
to eventually learn. 
Of course, as with any other debate, there is some middle ground. The centrists 
in the AI debate tend to support Conventional AI in theory, but they hold that within 
a short period of time, machine intelligence will develop past the cognitive mecha-
nisms of human intelligence. Without going beyond Conventional AI, development 
of machine intelligence will stagnate, so it’s a pragmatic choice to keep an eye on 
development of Computational Intelligence. 
McCarthy, the founder of the ﬁeld, is a ﬁrm believer in Computational Intelli-
gence. He said that AI relied on certain rules and logic. In the invitation letter to the 
Dartmouth workshop, he stated the purpose of the gathering: 
The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any 
other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be 
made to simulate it.12 
Implied here is the idea that all knowledge must ﬁrst be described. The only 
knowledge that can be transmitted to machines must ﬁrst be encoded in human 
language. Knowledge beyond that cannot be simulated by machines. 
McCarthy is completely uninterested in imitating the structure and mechanism 
of the human brain. He doesn’t want anything to do with psychology, cognition, or 
neurology. He has publicly stated that the study of AI should be separate from the study 
of human behavior. AI should be a branch of computer science, rather than psychology. 
From the beginning, Computational AI dominated the mainstream, but there was a 
greatdealofdiversityofopinion,evenwithindividualresearchers.Someofthedebates 
in AI have gone beyond the ﬁeld to enter philosophy. Marvin Minsky (1927–2006) was 
another organizer of the Dartmouth workshop, and he came to be regarded as one of 
the founders of the ﬁeld. He believed that the brain could be completely simulated; the

brain was nothing more than a machine. “I bet the human brain is a kludge,” he said. 
“Humans are nothing but meat machines that carry a computer in their head.”13 
From this, we can see that Minsky belonged to the school that believed AI must 
mimic human intelligence, but he was also the one that dealt a serious blow to 
Conventional AI. In 1969, he helped plunge AI into a troubled decade. 
3.3 
“I Don’t Know What It Means, but it Sounds 
Amazing”14 : The Rise of Deep Learning 
Conventional AI came from the study of the human brain and nervous system. At the 
beginning of the twentieth century, mankind discovered that the elementary particle 
of neural function is the neuron. 
The human brain has hundreds of billions of neurons, each with its own function. 
They are connected to each other and process information as a network. The neuron 
has a portion that receives information, called the dendrite. Each neuron has multiple 
dendrites but there is only one channel for transmitting information, called the axon. 
At the tail end of the axon are many terminals, which are connected to the dendrites 
of other neurons to form a synapse. This means that one neuron can receive trans-
missions from multiple neurons, process them, and transmit the information on to 
other neurons. 
So, there can be multiple input signals but only one output signal. Any given 
signal is determined by information received from other neurons. The study of this 
neurological structure provided inspiration to AI researchers. They tried to imitate it 
in machines as a way to give them the ability to make decisions (Fig. 3.4). 
In 1957, Cornell University’s Frank Rosenblatt (1928–1971) proposed the concept 
of perceptron. The algorithm received data from multiple sources, then used it to 
generate new information and transmit it on. 
Later, researchers in neurology discovered that the strength of connections 
between neurons can vary in strength. The difference in synapse strength impacted 
how information was transmitted: some information had a large impact and some had 
a small impact. As a result, computer scientists introduced a new concept: weight, 
referring to the strength of a connection between two nodes. The output of a neuron 
can be expressed with a mathematical formula: 
Here, w represents the weight of each input and G represents an unknown sum 
function. When countless perceptrons are connected together, they function like a 
human brain. It was the ﬁrst time that a computational model was used to imitate
13 Kolata (1982).

to particularly esoteric arguments.

the information processing method of the brain’s synapses. These were called neural 
networks at the time, but they can be more correctly understood as the ancestor of 
the later artiﬁcial neural network model. 
Over the next several years, neural networks became a key focus of mathemati-
cians, and a controversial method of machine learning. Prior to neural networks, AI 
was developed by programmers writing code, telling a computer what to do. These 
were basically If–Then statements. For example, the command might be: if X is 
greater than 100, then go to the 25th line of code and execute a particular mathemat-
ical operation. Or, if a certain condition is met, then output a certain parameter. This 
is setting rules for the computer. It’s an example of top down thinking. 
Machine learning does the opposite. It clariﬁes the independent variables—the 
input—and dependent variables—the output. At ﬁrst, there are no rules set, but after 
being fed data, the machine can begin to infer possible and optimum rules. These rules 
are about the weight each independent variable is given in the functional relationship. 
Once this functional relationship (another way to understand this is as a set model) 
is determined, it can be used to forecast the future. This is bottom up thinking. 
Machine learning is the autonomous capability of adjusting the weight given to 
variables and conﬁrming the model or functional relationship being used. The other 
goal is to draw down on the point where the output matches real data. In simpler 
terms, machine learning involves a computer digesting a large amount of data into a 
self-organizing and self-learning mathematical model that can then be used to predict 
the outcome of other scenarios. 
This process is very close to the human decision-making process. As we’ve already 
seen, data is a record of objective reality. This record contains cause, appearance, 
and effect, representing past experience. With machine learning, these experiences 
are put into a model that can be used to analyze future events (Fig. 3.5). 
In this way, the computer is not obviously smarter than their creators, but more 
capable. People can only consider four or ﬁve independent variables at the same time

before they are overwhelmed. But computers can weigh hundreds or even tens of 
thousands of variables simultaneously, performing huge and complex calculations 
very quickly. That is hard for the human brain to match. 
A complete neural network could have hundreds and thousands of perceptrons. 
Each perceptron must make its own calculations, so a large amount of computer 
power was required to run a neural network. But through the 1960s and 1970s, 
as these networks were proposed, computer power was limited. During this time, 
Minsky published a monograph titled Perceptron, speculating on the future of the 
neural network. Minsky noted that a single-layer neural network was only capable of 
simple linear classiﬁcation and even exclusive disjunction calculations (also called 
exclusive or, a logical operation that is true if and only if its arguments differ) were 
beyond its abilities. If you increased the number of layers, even by only a single 
layer, the amount of calculations necessary would increase exponentially. At that 
time, this seemed an impossible task. There seemed to be no future for multilayer 
neural networks (Figs. 3.6 and 3.7).

Fig. 3.7 Single layer neural network 
At the time, Minsky did not expect that computer power would rapidly increase 
tens of thousands of times. His judgment turned out to be wrong, but he was restricted 
by computer power of the time. As a giant in the ﬁeld, his word carried weight. His 
pessimistic view of neural networks became common wisdom. Many researchers 
and laboratories gave up on neural networks. 
The next decade is often called the “AI winter.” Through the 1970s, if a paper 
included “neutral network” in its title or abstract, most journals and conferences 
would reject it. Neural networks were out in the cold. 
There were, however, a few researchers that persisted through this AI winter, and 
the most notable is Carnegie-Mellon’s Geoffery Hinton (1947–). 
Hinton came from a background in psychology and got obsessed with cognitive 
science. For decades he had been focused on neural networks, even though everyone 
around him, including his PhD advisor suggested he abandon the pursuit and conﬁne 
himself to the ﬁeld of mathematical logic. 
From early in his academic career, Hinton had been interested in the idea that 
the brain does not store memories of objects or concepts in a single location, but 
distributes them across a range of neurons. When recalling a concept, the brain does 
not rely on a single neuron. Concepts and neurons have a many-to-many relationship: 
a concept can be deﬁned by multiple neurons, and a neuron can participate in the 
recall of multiple concepts.15 
What he called distributed representation became a core concept in the develop-
ment of neural networks. Here’s an example: when we hear and need to recall the 
meaning of something like Changbai Mountain (the name means, literally, “long, 
white” mountain), it’s a process that requires multiple neurons. One neuron gives

us the ﬁrst half, meaning long. Another neuron supplies the color. A third neuron 
supplies the category of the object. When the three neurons are activated at the same 
time, we can reproduce and understand the concept of Changbai Mountain. 
In 1986, Hinton and American psychologist David Everett Rumelhart (1942– 
2011) proposed the backpropagation algorithm (BP) to train multilayer neural 
networks, which greatly reduced the number of calculations required. This was 
a solution to Minsky’s criticisms and helped revive neural network research in 
academia. 
The multilayer network idea made possible by BP was very powerful. BP allowed 
the system to continuously analyze an almost inﬁnite number of complex functions. 
This was made possible by the fact that computer power had increased exponentially 
since the 1960s. Even though they had been locked out in the AI winter, neural 
networks returned (Fig. 3.8). 
In 1994, Hinton lost his ﬁrst wife to ovarian cancer. He remarried in 1997 and three years 
later, his second wife was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He was convinced that AI would 
revolutionize medicine. He expects that in the future, anyone will be able to request their 
genome sequenced for around a hundred US dollars (the current cost is ten times that). He 
also speculated that radiology would soon be taken over by AI, as well. 
The high water mark came in 2006. That year, Hinton published a paper in Science, 
pushing forward the concept of deep learning.17 
The depth here refers to the number of perceptrons. Hinton believes that as the 
number of layers increases, network parameters would increase. More parameters 
would mean that the network had stronger simulation capabilities, allowing it to 
approximate the nonlinear process of human thought. Hinton also proposed changes 
to the way AI systems were trained by adding a pre-training process. In this process, 
a point in parameter space can be found that allows the machine to much more 
quickly determine optimum weights. From there, the results can be ﬁne-tuned until
16 Shute (2017).

69
parameters across the network are further optimized. This allows the number of 
calculations to be decreased, as well as the time taken to complete them. 
Deep learning is the name Hinton chose, indicating that it was quite different from 
previous neural networks. 
Deep learning is an attempt to fully synthesize the mechanism of the human neural 
network. Each neuron can store information and make calculations. This distributes 
the functions across the network. Neurons in each layer receive input from the 
previous layer. After the neuron processes a piece of information, it is passed to other 
neurons. The strength or weakness of the links between neurons is what the neural 
network conﬁrms through a learning process. Increasing the number of layers can 
increase parameters and forge more complex relationships between neurons. Multi-
layer networks have multiple nested functions. These networks can create sophisti-
cated models, analyzing complex real world phenomena, and approaching intelligent 
human responses (Fig. 3.9). 
The structure of deep learning is parallel and distributed, self-adapting, and self-
organizing. It is precisely this self-adaptation and self-organization that has led to 
criticism. A neural network can only give what it believes to be the most correct 
result, but it cannot explain why a certain set of parameters or a certain functional 
relationship is better than another. Deep learning algorithms are like the brain in this 
way: we might arrive at an answer without knowing quite how we got there. Deep 
learning is a black box. Even the designer of the algorithm cannot say how it really 
works. “I don’t know what it means, but it sounds amazing,” as the saying goes. 
Controversy begets controversy. The amazing but inexplicable feats of deep 
learning soon revolutionized image recognition. In 2012, Hinton led a team in the 
annual ImageNet visual object recognition software contest, ImageNet Large Scale 
Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). His team used deep learning. Prior to this, 
most competitors in the ILSVRC used support-vector machines (SVMs). In 2010, 
the error rate of the top team was 28%, and that fell to 25.7% in 2011. In October

of 2012, Hinton’s team took that error rate to 15.3%. The second place Japanese 
team had an error rate of 26.2%. It was a startling moment in the history of artiﬁcial 
intelligence (Fig. 3.10).
After that, miracles came one after another. In the 2013 ILSVRC, the error rate 
went down to 11.5%, and it was brought to 7.4% in 2014. That number has contin-
uously fallen: 3.57% in 2015, 2.99% in 2016, and 2.25% in 2017, making it lower 
than the error rate of the average human. In other words, deep learning algorithms 
surpassed human competitors in image recognition. It was the beginning of a new 
era. 
As we discussed already, facial recognition in the Geometric Age had relied on 
extracting facial features and comparing them to vast databases that could include 
millions of photographs. The computer power required was immense. But with deep 
learning, the problem could be solved. The face could be divided into multiple layers, 
multiple features, abstract points, lines, etc. and it could compare parts or the whole. 
Each element would be continuously superimposed and veriﬁed, improving accuracy. 
Digression: ImageNet Challenge 
In 2009, in order to promote the development of the ﬁeld of machine vision, Fei-
Fei Li of Stanford, Li Kai of Princeton, and other Chinese researchers initiated 
the creation of the massive ImageNet database containing 3.2 million images. 
It took 80,000 English-language nouns from a language database and assigned

3.3 “I Don’t Know What It Means, but it Sounds …
71
500–1000 images to each. Since 2010, they have held the ILSVRC. The basic 
rules are the same each year, with participants using 1.2 million pictures from 
the database (these pictures belong to more than 1000 different categories and 
have been manually labeled) as training samples for their algorithm, which is 
then tested with 50,000 new pictures. The picture is marked with the ﬁve most 
likely categories. If the correct answer isn’t included in those ﬁve guesses, it is 
marked as an error. The lower the error rate, the higher accuracy mark the soft-
ware is given. In 2017, ImageNet split the ILSVRC into three categories: object 
localization, object detection, and object detection from video. By comparing 
the results from ILSVRC competitors over the years, we can ﬁnd that with 
the same number of parameters, deep learning has a higher accuracy rate than 
shallow networks. Until 2013, the depth of these multilayered networks was 
still in the single digits. In 2015, the top team used a network with a depth of 
152 layers. In 2016, the Chinese SenseTime team won with a neural network 
boasting 1207 layers. 
For example, Google FaceNet,18 introduced in 2015, can extract 128 facial 
features, including things like distance between the eyes, length of the nose, ear 
length, eyebrow top contour line, eyebrow lower contour line, eye width, etc. Google 
trained a deep learning algorithm and built a multilayer neural network. At ﬁrst, they 
gave it three pictures, two of them showing the same person. The algorithm took its 
128 features from the three images and began to compare them. This training is done 
to nudge the system in the direction of linking two of the pictures; even though the 
points measured will be slightly different between pictures of the same individual, 
they should differ slightly more than between a picture of two unrelated people. 
This step is repeated hundreds of thousands or millions of times, until the neural 
network can reliably generate the 128 points recorded for each subject. For different 
photos of the same person, it should give roughly the same function value. When 
these values approach close enough, the network can determine that they show the 
same person. For different people, the function value will be reliably different, too. 
As users, how this is done is not important. What we care about is whether or not 
the AI can ﬁnd the same person in different pictures. 
Deep learning has greatly improved the accuracy of facial recognition. It has also 
promoted the use of deep learning facial recognition in commercial applications. 
In November of 2015, Facebook launched a face recognition function that could 
identify users’ friends in uploaded photos. If the user enabled the Photo Magic 
function, Facebook algorithms analyzed their recent photos, searching for faces it 
recognized. It would then prompt the user to share the photos. The accuracy rate 
reached 98%.19 In September of 2017, Apple phones started coming equipped with

facial recognition tools. Users could use their face to unlock their phone or authorize 
a payment. According to Apple, they reached an accuracy rate above 99%. 
Of course, this is not all down to Hinton’s advances. In addition to the continuous 
optimization of deep learning algorithms, there are two additional factors: the ﬁrst is 
the exponential increase in computing power since the 1960s, and the second is the 
arrival of big data. What big data provides for AI is a large amount of training data. 
Deep learning allows AI to learn independently, constantly adjusting parameters 
and functional relationships. Without the rise in computer power and big data, deep 
learning would never have taken off. 
Many believe that deep learning is the most signiﬁcant breakthrough in AI over 
the past thirty years. It has reignited the dream of true artiﬁcial intelligence. What 
is imagined could come of AI has expanded. The physiological structures of the 
human brain have not changed much over the past several millennia, but big data 
keeps growing and computing power increases exponentially. AI is evolving faster 
than humans are, which has led to the widespread belief that the former will surpass, 
rather than simply match the latter. 
When we talk about surpassing the human brain, my opinion is that it will take 
place in the realm of being able to perform calculations faster and being able to 
analyze information. This expands human brain power, in my opinion, rather than 
surpassing or replacing it. Human beings cannot create things that are more intelligent 
than ourselves. This should be the basis for understanding AI.

Data Track and Field: How the Government Promotes 
Corporate Innovation 
Since 2012 and breakthroughs in deep learning, facial recognition has achieved great 
successes and its application has expanded. However, facial recognition moved out 
of laboratories and into commercial applications as early as the 1990s. This built on 
even earlier successes. 
The driving force was the DoD. 
Since the Geometric Age, researchers have been working hard on facial recogni-
tion, even without the beneﬁt of deep learning. In addition to technical bottlenecks, 
there were two difﬁculties: one was the amount of data required to train the algo-
rithms, and the second was that the industry lacked standards to evaluate the beneﬁts 
or drawbacks of various algorithms. 
The United States government resolved both problems. In 1992, the DoD Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Counterdrug Technology Devel-
opment Program Ofﬁce (CTDPO), and Army Research Laboratory (ARL) jointly 
launched the Face Recognition Technology (FERET) program. The program, which 
lasted for three years, was meant to leverage government power to push for the estab-
lishment of standards in the facial recognition industry. Standardization was the ﬁrst 
step to allow the technology to mature, and to eventually bring it to market.

3.4 Data Track and Field: How the Government …
73
FERET’s primary contribution was to establish a large-scale database of images 
for facial recognition. This allowed researchers from different institutions to develop 
and test software on a common dataset. That made it possible to easily compare the 
advantages and disadvantages of various algorithms. 
In order to maintain the consistency of the database, the images had to be collected 
in a controlled way. Each time the subjects were photographed, the same conditions 
had to be maintained. From August 1993 to July 1996, ﬁfteen phases of image 
collection were carried out. The database contained 1199 individuals, 1564 sets of 
pictures, and 14,126 images. The collection of the images took three years because 
it was necessary to take multiple pictures of the same subject over time to study the 
effects of age on the face. 
Let’s say a country wants to develop its track and ﬁeld talents… The ﬁrst thing it 
has to do is build venues for athletes to train and compete. That is the signiﬁcance of 
FERET. Its database provided AI players with a place to train. To this day, FERET 
remains the largest image database of its kind in the United States. It is run now by 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and still open to use by 
external applicants. 
Between August 1994 and March 1998, DoD organized universities and tech ﬁrms 
to conduct three rounds of evaluations using their database. The results seemed to 
prove that the technology had matured to the point where it could be deployed in the 
ﬁeld. Even when it involved manual intervention, there were still three key problems: 
1.
Lighting. It is difﬁcult for AI to match the same face under different lighting 
conditions. 
2.
Time. Even if the program is successful at ﬁrst, its accuracy decreases. 
3.
Geometry. The same as it was since the Bledsoe era, when the face is rotated 
more than ﬁfteen degrees, accuracy drops. 
The FERET evaluation was signiﬁcant. It promoted the exchange of knowledge 
in the ﬁeld, it pushed the players toward a consensus on certain things, and helped 
create standards. The various players involved in facial recognition also moved 
toward commercialization. In 1996, Alex Pentland (1952–) of MIT sold his algorithm 
and established Viisage Technology. Three other MIT researchers started Visionics. 
Another MIT professor started Miros. These three companies all became standard 
bearers in the American facial recognition ﬁeld. Their earliest customers were DoD, 
as well as government agencies in charge of policing, justice, transportation, and 
drug enforcement. 
The ﬁrst to ofﬁcially use facial recognition was the Department of Motor Vehicles 
(DMV). In the United States, each state has an independent DMV that issues driver’s 
licenses in their own particular format. This led to a problem with one person having 
multiple licenses in different states. If someone was no longer eligible for a license in 
one state, they could travel to another jurisdiction and get the necessary documents. 
Some of those people even worked as commercial drivers. There was also the issue 
of social security fraud, with people using multiple identities to claim beneﬁts they 
were not entitled to. Fugitives could also get driver’s licenses issued by the DMV in 
other states as a way to hide their identity.

74

The Face and AI
In 1997, New Mexico and West Virginia undertook a project to standardize and 
digitize all of their driver’s license photos so that they could quickly be scanned by 
DMV computers. They also began networking DMV management systems across 
states to allow interjurisdictional conﬁrmation of identities. 
By 2015, most states had facial recognition software and were impressed with 
the results. With the launch of New York’s program in 2010, 14,500 drivers were 
discovered to be holding two or more licenses. These were mostly fraudulent, and 
they resulted in investigations of 9500 people and the arrest of 3500. Since 2011, 
the New Jersey DMV began referring an average of 600 cases a year to prosecutors. 
There was another beneﬁt: by comparing photos, many DMVs found errors in their 
data. New Jersey’s DMV found 12,500 errors in their database between 2011 and 
2015.20 
In addition to rooting out fraudulent identities and errors, facial recognition also 
simpliﬁed the process of driver’s license renewal. Government identity documents 
have to be replaced every few years and that usually requires going to a photo studio to 
take pictures, but facial recognition technology allowed the process to be streamlined, 
with applicants uploading pictures taken with their phones. This is the essence of 
the “single trip” and “no interview approval” programs being undertaken now in 
Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Guangdong. 
In order to improve the accuracy of the algorithm, photos should be taken from the 
front, without any head covering, wearing a neutral expression, and with appropriate 
lighting. A smile makes it harder for a computer to measure the face, since it changes 
the geometry. This is another example of mankind adapting themselves to a new age 
of AI. We must accommodate the machines. 
After state DMVs, facial recognition software went into use by drug enforcement 
agencies, passport management, social security and welfare departments, as well as 
credit management agencies. For federal police bureaus, being able to send a picture 
of a fugitive to the immigration bureaus was a major step forward. If a fugitive had 
gotten travel documents under another name, it would be elementary to conﬁrm that. 
Facial recognition technology showed great potential. 
A commercial market emerged for facial recognition around the year 2000. Facial 
recognition’s momentum didn’t last long, however. Another blast of cold air like the 
one that had frozen AI before was about to blow. This time, the cause was Skynet.

Historical Vicissitudes: How 9/11 Saved Facial 
Recognition 
There have always been two driving forces behind the development of facial tech-
nology. The ﬁrst is technical, driven by researchers in AI. They need machine 
vision to create smarter AI. Facial recognition was one of the peaks that the ﬁeld

had to surmount. Another driving force was administrative, coming from govern-
ment departments that were running surveillance networks. Skynet generates a large 
amount of data each day. Investigations like those carried out by the police services 
tracking Zhou Kehua were not a sustainable proposition. 
When looking at applications of facial recognition, there are broadly two cate-
gories. The ﬁrst is static identiﬁcation. We have an example of this from Nanjing’s 
Xuanwu District: in March of 2017, they launched a program that would allow people 
to authenticate their identity by uploading a photograph through an ofﬁcial WeChat 
account, along with their name, ID, number, and address. After successful veriﬁca-
tion using facial recognition, they receive a message allowing them to check into a 
hotel or access other services requiring ID. 
The second application is dynamic identiﬁcation. This is most often used by 
Skynet. A face appears in a surveillance video and its identity must be conﬁrmed 
against a database. This presents two difﬁculties. The ﬁrst is that the face might 
not be captured at the right angle, the ideal light, or with enough sharpness, making 
matching difﬁcult. The second is that the identity may or may not exist in the database. 
We don’t know for sure, so a threshold must be set for what gets sent for manual 
comparison. If you set the threshold too low, you end up with too many results, and 
the system releases a ﬂood of vaguely similar results. But if the threshold is set too 
high, it’s possible that matches will be overlooked. 
As I’ve already mentioned, the UK was the ﬁrst country to build a surveillance 
network. In 1998, the ﬁrst group of companies born from FERET began to enter 
the British market. London Borough of Newham chose Visionics’ program. They 
became the ﬁrst region to integrate AI facial recognition into a surveillance network. 
Prior to this, public order had been lacking in Newham. Visonics claimed that 
its system could automatically scan the faces of anyone passing under a camera, 
compare them against a criminal database, and issue a warning. Newham became 
a publicity victory for Visionics. They installed facial recognition systems in more 
than 250 locations and spared no effort to promote their “magic bullet.”21 
The results exceeded all expectations. In the year after the system was installed, 
the crime rate in Newham went down by 40%. In the following year, it was reduced 
by another 34%.22 This is impressive data, of course, and you might think it proves 
the worth of such a system… But the truth is, facial recognition did not lead to any 
arrests made by local police. Not a single one! Critics charged that the system was 
“high-tech snake oil” and next to useless.23 
I believe that the deterrent effect of facial recognition and surveillance networks 
could be greater than technical capabilities. When technologies like this are popu-
larized and become well known, they become a social technology. That means, their 
success is not only down to technological capabilities, but also their inﬂuence on 
mass psychology. The good guys and the bad guys are both afraid of ubiquitous

public data collection, so the role of surveillance networks are exaggerated. When 
every moment could be recorded, it tends to raise morality. The more awareness there 
is of surveillance networks and facial recognition, the greater the deterrence effect 
they have. This is similar to the chilling effect. 
In 2001, Tampa, Florida installed a dynamic facial recognition from Visionics, 
centering it on a nightlife district with lax public order. Locals protested. Opponents 
of the program charged that it treated everyone as a criminal suspect. 
However, as happened in Newham, the Tampa system did not lead to any criminals 
being arrested. On the contrary, it led to innocent people being harassed. Due to errors 
made by the system, the system spit out fourteen alerts in one day, leading to a single 
citizen being contacted by police ten times. Catching bad guys aside, the system 
could be used to help ﬁnd missing children or elderly people, but that didn’t happen, 
either. 
In the end, Tampa suspended the program. In their statement, they made it clear 
that the reason for the suspension was not privacy concerns but the poor performance 
of facial recognition.24 
The Visionics’ prestige faded. In fact, the Tampa statement was a major blow to 
all commercial facial recognition companies. The results of implementing dynamic 
facial recognition in the UK and the United States were a resounding failure. Another 
nadir was on the horizon. 
No one realized that a major historical turning point was quietly approaching. 
Facial recognition might have lost prestige, but this event would trigger national 
discussion and an upsurge in application of the technology. 
This turning point was September 11th, 2001. 
That morning, nineteen terrorists hijacked four airliners. 
Two of them crashed into the towers of the World Trade Center; one crashed 
into the Pentagon; and the ﬁnal ﬂight crashed in Pennsylvania. These attacks caused 
3040 deaths. It was the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States. The 
country was plunged into sadness, resentment, and reﬂection. It was a turning point 
for many aspects of American politics. 
A few days after the incident, two photos began circulating in the media and 
online. The ﬁrst was from surveillance footage taken at Portland International Jetport 
in Maine, showing hijackers Mohammed Atta and Abdulaziz al-Omari going through 
security. After that came a picture full from surveillance at Dulles International in 
Washington, showing two more hijackers undergoing screening and boarding their 
ﬂight. Days before the incident, their names had been added to watch lists, but they 
still passed all security checks (Fig. 3.11).

What about facial recognition? Why was nobody using it? These questions were 
raised many times in the aftermath of the terrorist attack.

Two months later, during Senate hearings on technology and terrorism, Senator 
Dianne Feinstein demanded to know how this had happened: 
How could a large group of coordinated terrorists operate for more than a year in the United 
States without being detected and then get on four different airliners in a single morning 
without being stopped? The answer to this question is that we could not identify them. We 
did not know they were here. Only if we can identify terrorists planning attacks on the United 
States do we have a chance of stopping them. … For example, in the case of at least two 
of the hijackers, authorities had pictures of them as suspects prior to the attack and airport 
cameras actually photographed them but because these cameras did not use facial biometric 
systems, security was not alerted and the hijackers remained free to carry out their bloody 
plans. 
Dynamic facial recognition, on the verge of being abandoned as a failure, was 
resurrected after 9/11. Suddenly, there were no voices being raised against privacy 
violations. Using facial recognition and personal data was deemed acceptable, as 
long as it was ﬁghting terrorism. It was what the public wanted. 
The public wanted it, so facial recognition made a comeback. Visionics imme-
diately released a fresh white paper. They said that facial recognition should be a 
key part of airport security, but that would require a large amount of data and photos 
from suspected terrorists. With the right database, facial recognition would work. 
With static and dynamic facial recognition, terrorists would be caught. 
Visionics’ white paper avoided an important question: Was their facial recogni-
tion technology actually effective? Historical experience shows that these questions 
usually take at least a decade to answer. At that point, though, it was ﬁfteen years 
before deep learning would mature to the point that it could aid in facial recognition.

A Society with Anonymity: The Prospect of Dynamic 
Facial Recognition 
In June of 2017, China Central Television reported that ten intersections in Suqian, 
Jiangsu had implemented a Pedestrian Red Light Facial Recognition system. If a 
pedestrian crossed against the light, their photo and some personal information would 
be displayed in real time on a video screen at the intersection. There would be a delay

Fig. 3.13 Crossing signal violators caught in Shenzhen 
of about ten seconds. The information would also go to trafﬁc enforcement police, 
who would conﬁrm details in the household registration database. The report went 
on to say that within a month of the program being implemented 580 pedestrians 
had been caught running the light. Accuracy was around 90%. In March of 2018, 
Shenzhen launched a similar program on a larger scale (Figs. 3.12 and 3.13). 
These are examples of dynamic facial recognition in action, and they seem to be 
working… So, why did the systems in Newham and Tampa ten years earlier fail? 
This touches on two key issues in dynamic facial recognition. As I mentioned earlier, 
the accuracy of static facial recognition has reached 99%, which shows its maturity

79
as a technology. But dynamic facial recognition falls far short of static identiﬁcation. 
It’s even hard to determine the criteria with which to evaluate the technology. The 
problems lie in the fact that the environment around a subject cannot be controlled, 
neither can angles or light, and camera quality has not been standardized. The quality 
of images pulled from surveillance footage for image recognition can range wildly 
in quality. But facial recognition works best when dealing with a frontal photo, with 
no headcover, and a neutral expression. 
When looking at the crosswalk red light cameras, there are certain aspects that 
make dynamic facial recognition more successful: pedestrians generally walk in 
a straight line to cross a street, there is generally good lighting, and there are no 
obstructions. The camera can be set at the best location to capture faces passing by. 
The red light camera operates in an environment that is not static, but somewhat 
controlled. It’s a semi-controlled dynamic environment. 
Even in a semi-controlled dynamic environment, facial recognition accuracy is 
not close to approaching perfect. Individual companies claim to have achieved 99% 
accuracy in static recognition, but with very large databases, 99 and 99.5% represent 
a large difference. The population of a city can be in the millions, and Shenzhen is 
already in the tens of millions. That means photos are being compared against large 
databases, which presents a challenge. It’s because of these limitations that local 
police forces cannot use the output of their facial recognition systems to levy ﬁnes. 
That is why they use the method of public shaming of violators. 
This method can be effective, too, of course. According to statistics, trafﬁc acci-
dents caused by pedestrians accounted for 16% of the total, and accidents caused by 
non motorized vehicles accounted for 33.4%. As I write this book, nearly a hundred 
jurisdictions in China are experimenting with projects to cut down on pedestrian 
violations of crossing signals. This is not only to cut down on accidents, but also to 
improve public safety culture. 
At the end of 2013, police in San Diego, California started being equipped with 
portable facial recognition equipment. These tablets could be used to take a photo of 
people they made contact with, then conﬁrm their identity against a database. Since 
2017, Chinese Public Security ofﬁcers have also begun using mobile equipment with 
facial recognition capabilities. The idea behind it is described as, “collection of infor-
mation is recording information, recording information is analyzing information, 
analyzing information is discovering evidence.” Police can use a photo and compare 
it to provincial databases, national fugitive databases, and persons of interest. It only 
takes seconds. At present, this mobile equipment is being popularized by front-line 
ofﬁcers in county-level police forces. In the past year or so, many fugitives have been 
discovered by mobile patrols with this equipment. 
In February of 2018, Zhengzhou Railway Police were among the ﬁrst to use facial 
recognition glasses. News reports claimed that these glasses could detect criminals 
among station passengers through facial recognition (Fig. 3.14).25

Left: Police in San Diego carry equipment that can quickly determine the identity of people 
they come into contact with.26 
Right: Facial recognition glasses in use by Zhengzhou Railway Police. 
This mobile equipment provides novel scenarios to apply dynamic facial recogni-
tion. In the future, dynamic facial recognition will be taking place at street level, with 
the police conﬁrming the identities of citizens they’re making contact with, and also, 
when facial recognition is integrated into surveillance, high above, in the monitoring 
centers of these networks. When the cloud can link together all of these cameras and 
facial recognition, we can quickly conﬁrm the identity of anyone that they capture, 
and we can also restore their trajectory through the city. 
My own prediction is that dynamic facial recognition will one day become ubiq-
uitous. We will enter an age when everyone can be isolated, recorded, and analyzed 
at will. When we look back at the popularization of photography in the ﬁrst decade of 
the twentieth century, governments generally needed to seek cooperation and permis-
sion to take photographs of a person. More importantly, capturing this data was a 
one-time process. Things are very different now. The government can carry out large 
scale surveillance, capturing pictures of a person in public, without their consent or 
even knowledge. No government previously possessed this ability. 
This also suggests that mankind is about to lose their right to anonymity in public. 
In a democratic society, the right of anonymity is related to or forms the basis of many 
other rights. For example, when the police can train facial recognition equipment on 
a demonstration or march, their rights to assembly may be infringed.

High Deﬁnition Society: Granular 
Governance and a Population in Cages 
Abstract Societies change. In a data-driven society, we all become like tadpoles, 
trailing our trajectory behind us. In the cloud, we all have a super ﬁle. It records nearly 
all of your behaviors and is updated each day to stay fully integrated. The super ﬁle 
can be checked or veriﬁed by anyone, and it can be fully analyzed by a computer. This 
super ﬁle and its analysis and tracking will work differently depending on whether 
we are talking about a democratic or authoritarian society. However, that’s not to say 
that democratic societies can avoid abuse. I have already covered a number of these 
potential abuses but this chapter will focus on one of the positives: with the spotlight 
of data to shine, crime can be averted. We might ﬁnally live in—to borrow a famous 
phrase—a world without thieves. 
A wise ruler has no subjects in his nation that trust things to luck. If the common 
people are waiting for luck to deliver them, it will bring misfortune to the nation.— 
Adapted from the Commentary of Zuo, “Sixtieth Year of Duke Xuan.”1 
As I mentioned in the previous chapter, governments at present can analyze the 
path of a car traveling through a city with image and facial recognition, and that 
ability will only improve and become more widespread. 
History proceeds down many paths. In addition to artiﬁcial intelligence, another 
development is being harnessed to increase the capabilities of modern governments. 
That development is progressing faster than even artiﬁcial intelligence. 
I am referring to the networking and integration of big data. 
Anyone living in an urban environment generates a large amount of data about 
themselves, but there are artiﬁcial divisions in the storage of this data. Data about the 
same person, the same event, or the same period of time might be scattered across 
the systems of the various units collecting it. Many companies are now pursuing data 
integration as a way to better understand consumer behavior and drive proﬁts; govern-
ments are now throwing their administrative power and expertise behind similar 
efforts. Coupled with Skynet’s ability to track people in an urban environment, the 
integration of large amounts of data represents a breakthrough in social governance.

High Deﬁnition Society: Granular Governance and a Population…
Even in countries like India and China, which both have more than a billion citi-
zens, hundreds of millions of vehicles, and tens of millions of companies, govern-
ments will be able to exercise control through the cloud, directing people, trafﬁc, 
and business. As granular governance gets down to an atomic level, I propose a new 
name to describe it: single particle governance. 
Particularly in a highly centralized society, this model presents serious risks. If 
used carelessly, it can begin a process of putting people in virtual cages. As more 
and more data is integrated into the whole and every action is monitored, the bars of 
the cage become thicker and the gaps between them thinner.

Pattern Recognition: Entering the High Deﬁnition 
Society 
At dawn, I addressed a petition to the emperor, 
That evening, I was exiled to Chaozhou, eight thousand li away. 
I only wished to warn his majesty of evil things, 
Knowing that I might sacriﬁce my good years. 
Watching clouds over the Qinling Mountains. Where is my home? 
Snow chokes the pass. My horse won’t go on. 
You must have had your reasons for coming so far, 
So please bury my bones by the riverside. 
This is a poem by Han Yu (768–824), written in his tragic ﬁnal years. The emperor 
had become a devotee of Buddhism and planned a ceremony to receive a Buddha’s 
ﬁnger bone relic. Han Yu wrote a letter of petition opposing it. The response came 
within hours. The emperor sent him into exile in distant Changzhou. Rather than 
being given time to prepare, he was ordered to leave immediately. 
On January 14th of 819, Han Yu headed south into exile. He was 52 years old. Han 
Yu had a glorious career before that and had achieved many things. Centuries later, 
when the Song Dynasty poet Su Shi (1037–1101) inscribed a stone stele for a shrine 
to Han Yu, he wrote: “His writing reversed the literary decline of eight dynasties.” 
The only way to get to Chaozhou was horseback. He struggled to get through snowy 
passes in the Qinling mountains. His twelve year old daughter died on the way there. 
How long did the journey take? There are very few historical records of the trip 
into exile, but Han Yu is said to have arrived in Chaozhou on April 25th, a hundred 
days after leaving the court. Throughout history, many other people faced similar 
situations. Su Shi, who memorialized Han Yu, was sent into an even more unpleasant 
and distant exile. He died of illness at the age of 64 in Changzhou in 1101. He had 
recently been pardoned and was on the way home. 
Reading these records, we can’t help but marvel sadly at the insigniﬁcance of our 
species. We long for eternity, but we leave almost no trace behind. In ancient times, 
footprints on a dusty road would have been blown away; and it’s even harder now: I

recall a singer from the 1990s that had a line about how asphalt was too hard to have 
any trace of our passing be left behind. Rabindrinath Tagore (1861–1941) wrote: “I 
leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my ﬂight.” With those 
lines, he made a wish for his generation and every one that came before it. 
Nowadays, we often take public transportation instead of walking. If you take a 
trip, you buy a ticket. At the end of the trip, some people hold onto the ticket stub. 
This is proof that we have taken a trip. Compared to the past, we have a record of 
our comings and goings. 
Some people collect their tickets. When they are old, they can look back on all the 
trips they took. Those tickets can bring back old memories. But if they are separated 
from an individual’s remembrance, they have no particular value. They don’t tell us 
the path a person took, but only one part of their journey. 
Around 2010, China began experimenting with real name registration for train 
tickets. Once the reform of the ticketing system was complete, it became a require-
ment for traveling. All trips made after New Year’s Day 2012 required real name 
registration. 
A ticket registered to a real name becomes a piece of data stored in a railway 
company cloud database. Crucially, an individual’s trips can be linked together under 
a single account through a identiﬁcation card number; this collected data can be pulled 
at a future date out of a massive collection of data. Thinking back to Han Yu, it’s 
hard to believe: his long voyage on horseback left almost no trace, but our frictionless 
journey by high-speed rail leaves countless footprints in a database. 
In our unbelievably complex modern society, the value and signiﬁcance of a 
journey by public transportation being traceable to a single identity cannot be over-
stated. One of the key conclusions of this book is that a society’s level of civilizational 
development is directly linked to its ability to record and analyze data (Fig. 4.1). 
Controlling smoking on trains has always been an issue. In the days before high-
speed rail, when the rail network was dominated by the rudimentary “green skin” 
carriages, the space between cars served as the smoking area. Although there was 
some distance between passenger seating and this area, second-hand smoke could still 
drift through the cars, upsetting non-smokers. On the fully-sealed carriages meant 
for high-speed rail, smoking had to be banned. A new list of regulations introduced in 
2014 banned smoking on electric multiple-unit trains (EMUs) and set a ﬁne of 500– 
2,000 yuan. That was not a sufﬁcient deterrent for hardcore puffers. Occasionally 
people would light up and simply request to pay the ﬁne. 
It was not until 2016 that the railways found an effective enforcement method: 
from August 15th of that year, smokers could be hit with a ban. Buying a ticket meant 
acknowledging an agreement not to smoke. If a passenger was caught twice, they 
could be deprived of their right to ride. 
The ban was very effective. It required an electronic ticketing system and real 
name registration. That allowed for the offense to be linked to an identity. It became 
much easier to levy ﬁnes. 
This sort of social management could be taken beyond smoking bans to social 
credit management. In 2013, the Chinese Supreme Court began to establish a list 
of “Persons Subject to Enforcement for Trust-Breaking.” According to a February

2017 report, more than 6.73 million people had been added to the list, 6.15 million 
had been restricted from buying plane tickets, and 2.2 million banned from buying 
train tickets.3 This is a positive effect of granular social governance. 
This has been extended even to taxis. 
Since their advent, the world has dealt with taxi drivers committing crimes, espe-
cially against female passengers. In 1982, taxi driver Lam Kor-wan was arrested in 
Hong Kong for murdering four of his passengers.4 
A woman boards a car and then disappears into the vast city. If anything happens 
to her, it can be hard to determine true events, unless we have records. 
In 2016, DiDi launched a function that would allow passengers to share their 
travel itinerary. Information could be shared in real time with relatives and friends via 
WeChat, QQ, or text message. That information included departure point, destination, 
time of boarding, time of departure, distance traveled, estimated time of arrival, 
license plate, and real time location. Users could set their DiDi app to automatically 
share the information to an emergency contact. This function was quite popular.

Fig. 4.2 The development of currency toward data 
According to data from April of 2017, it was used an average of more than 200,000 
times a day.5 
In May and then again in August of 2018, the DiDi platform was rocked by 
incidents of young women being raped and murdered. DiDi announced that it would 
end its carpool service. Apart from strengthening background checks on drivers, my 
suggestion was that DiDi should implement a one-touch emergency feature. When 
triggered, it would immediately send location, passenger information, license plate, 
and details of the car’s appearance to police. 
Of course, the data recorded now is not limited to travel itineraries but also 
behaviors related to payment and purchases. 
In Han Yu’s time, currency was made of metal. That was replaced by paper 
currency, which is now making way for credit and debit cards. Nowadays, it is more 
common to use our phones to pay. Currency is just another data point. We add and 
subtract numbers on a screen (Fig. 4.2). 
As I have already discussed, big data has promoted smart business. Payment 
behavior is disappearing, along with cash. For example, if we use DiDi to hail a ride, 
there is no need to actually carry out a payment because the fare will automatically 
be deducted. The only record of the transaction is in the cloud. 
In the past, there were transactions but limited records. Now, transactions are 
becoming even more simpliﬁed, so we must keep records of them. 
Payment behavior can be recorded but so can social behavior. In 2016, when 
Kim Kardashian was robbed in Paris, she was left tied up in a bathroom, while $11 
million worth of jewelry was taken. Security experts suggested that one reason she 
was targeted was because of her habit of sharing her lavish lifestyle on social media. 
On the day of the incident, shortly after arriving in Paris, she had posted about fashion 
shows, meals, and luxury purchases. These social media posts revealed her location 
and what thieves could expect to ﬁnd. 
Imagine for a moment what it would be like if Han Yu had Alipay, Weibo, and 
WeChat. We would know every purchase he made and each stop along the way. A trail 
of data would follow him. There would be pictures of him in the WeChat Moments 
of people he met along the way. There would be a clear picture of his voyage from 
Xi’an to Chaozhou that could be analyzed by future generations.

In the ﬁnal analysis, Weibo, WeChat, and Twitter are all records. They are 
individualized, granular, and traceable. 
What we wear, what we eat, the places we stay, the ways we travel, and where we 
go—these are all recorded on the Internet and information platforms. Stored with 
this data are named, ID numbers, phone numbers, and other individual identiﬁers, 
such as bank account number, WeChat ID, height, weight, face shape, etc. Data can 
be integrated into a complete picture. In the database, an individual has a unique 
“data presence.” This presence can be deﬁned, supported, and endorsed by countless 
pieces of data in much the same way as sound waves or ﬁngerprints. Each piece of 
data has its own characteristics. This is what I mean by pattern recognition for data. 
They can simply be called “data patterns.” 
Just as everyone’s face, ﬁngerprints, heartbeat, blood pressure, and other physi-
ological features and functions are different, every person’s social behavior will be 
unique. This data is continuously collected and analyzed. They can also be integrated. 
A person’s physical condition can be connected to their consumption habits, their 
social relationships, their credit, medical treatment, and education. This forms an 
even more unique and complex data pattern. With these data patterns, individuals 
can be deﬁned and differentiated. 
In China, our earliest understanding of pattern recognition was when looking at 
stone and jade. These materials all have different grains, shapes, and colors. Upon 
closer observation, they can be differentiated from each other. Today, data generated 
by people, groups, and objects provide social patterns to analyze. We can see them 
clearly, twisting together or extending separately; they might be multi-faceted or 
simplistic. For the ﬁrst time in human history, these patterns can be extracted and 
analyzed. 
Whether in East or West, human societies of the past were not viewable in high 
deﬁnition. It was always somewhat hazy. Even if there were social patterns, they 
were too coarse to read. 
The problem of a low deﬁnition society 
I called Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania home for six years. The city has four distinct 
seasons, home prices are low, and it’s quite liveable. However much it has going 
for it, the city has not devoted much of its resources to attracting tourists. There are 
not many sites to draw visitors. I faced this problem when friends visited me and I 
had to ﬁnd places to take them. My default choice was Amish Country. 
The Amish are known for their strict observance of the traditions of their agricul-
tural ancestors. In their communities, the achievements of industrial civilization are 
pointedly avoided. There are no electric lights, telephones, TVs, or cars. They also 
refuse conscription into the military, voting in elections, and receiving state beneﬁts. 
They live a simple, primitive life, holding themselves aloof from the people around 
them. 
I can’t help but think of Account of the Peach Blossom Spring by Tao Yuanming 
(365–427) and its description of a utopia protected from the outside world. When 
friends visited and they saw people living without electricity or cars, they were 
amazed. The land that the Amish live on is vast and fertile; old and young live together;

4.1 Pattern Recognition: Entering the High Deﬁnition Society
89
and the atmosphere is peaceful. The Amish reject modern industrial civilization’s 
advantages, but also its disadvantages. Perhaps they can provide some kind of model 
for us. 
If a ﬁrst impression of the Amish was correct, and they’re unique simply because 
they spurn electricity and the internal combustion engine, this might be correct. But 
it also wouldn’t take much to reform that kind of society into a modern one. It was 
actually a movie that made me realize precisely how primitive and backwards the 
Amish are—and it has nothing to do with technology. 
The Oscar-winning 1985 American ﬁlm Witness is about an 8 year old Amish boy 
named Samuel Lapp. While attending a funeral in Philadelphia, the boy is a witness 
to the slaying of an undercover police ofﬁcer. While peering through a crack in the 
stall, he catches a glimpse of the killer’s face. 
This is another story about facial recognition. 
A detective named John Booker is in charge of investigating the murder. He’s a 
tough man that drags the Amish boy around the city, hoping he’ll spot the murderer 
among the people he sees. The boy keeps shaking his head no. They can’t ﬁnd the 
murderer. One day, out of the blue, he sees the face he’s been looking for: Lapp is 
sitting in the police station when he spots a framed news report about an ofﬁcer. He’s 
sure it was the man that killed the undercover cop. The man that Lapp ﬁngers used 
to work with Book and was previously investigated for embezzlement and selling 
precursor chemicals that the police had seized. Book guessed that the murder of the 
undercover cop had been an attempt to cover up those crimes. He immediately went 
to his superiors to report the case. But it turns out Book’s commanding ofﬁcer is in 
cahoots with the murderer, so he sets out to kill Book. Shot and wounded, Book takes 
refuge in Lapp’s home in Lancaster County—Amish Country. 
Book’s commanding ofﬁcer knows the name of the key witness and that he’s 
Amish, so he mobilizes Lancaster police to track them down. Lancaster police inform 
the city cop that there’s no way they’re going to ﬁnd the boy quickly: there are 40,000 
Amish in the county, a third of them share the same surname, and none of them have 
telephones. They have to go door-to-door, which is not a simple procedure. 
In modern times, if we want to ﬁnd someone, we start with their name, then a 
phone number. After that, we might ﬁnd an address. Nowadays, we might try to track 
down a WeChat account. There can be identical names, but likely not identical names 
attached to the same phone number or address. But in a society without telephones 
and a handful of shared surnames, it’s hard to tell people apart. This is what I mean 
by a low deﬁnition society. 
The governance of a low deﬁnition society is necessarily inefﬁcient and uncertain. 
A low deﬁnition society can provide asylum to people seeking refuge, but it can also 
shelter the wicked. In Witness, Amish Country provides a hiding place for Book. 
That gives him the time he needs to recover from his injuries. When his commanding 
ofﬁcer ﬁnally tracks him down, he is ready to ﬁght. The battle between good and evil 
can begin. 
Names were humanity’s ﬁrst attempt to reduce ambiguity and move toward a 
higher deﬁnition society.

High Deﬁnition Society: Granular Governance and a Population…
Digression: Surnames are the creation of the state 
Before the 14th century, most of the world did without surnames. In the Meiji 
Restoration in Japan, the government found the management of household 
registrations and taxation unwieldy, since not everyone had a surname. They 
had to give citizens a time limit to adopt them. As a result, many people 
now bear surnames related to the area where they lived, their profession, or 
even vegetables. The Japanese population was not large, but that drive to give 
everyone a surname resulted in it having the greatest variety in names, with the 
estimate being as many as 110,000. In 1808, we have another example, with 
Napoleon commanding French Jews to adopt surnames. In 1849, the Spanish 
arrived in the Philippines and found that most people there shared a small 
number of names. It caused a great deal of confusion to them. The ﬁrst thing 
they did upon establishing control over the islands was to require every Filipino 
to register a set, unique title for themselves. In Turkey, this happened much 
later. It wasn’t until the 1920s that Turkish authorities commanded everyone 
to use the name of their home town as their surname.6 
Using locations and professions as surnames is very common in human history. 
Chinese surnames like Qi, Lu, Qin, and Jin, derive from the names of ancient 
states. Less common two-character surnames like Dong’guo, Nanmen, and 
Nan’gong come from plane names and directions. English-language surnames 
like Smith and Baker are from professions. 
The reason why states created surnames to differentiate people. Clarity is a prereq-
uisite for management and control. Ambiguity is the enemy not only of science but 
also the greatest enemy of management. In social management, individuals need to 
be attached to information in a system of national records. At that point, household 
registration, taxation, conscription, public security, medical care, welfare, property, 
proprietary rights, and inheritance can be administered. Clarity is the foundation of 
state administration. 
China completed the process of differentiating people based on names quite early. 
Terms like “old hundred names,” referring to common people, is a sign of that long 
history. In fact, China was fairly stable in feudal times; the system of names has 
something to do with this. 
However, relying only on names to differentiate people and carry out public 
management is still crude, and governments cannot quickly differentiate and conﬁrm 
a single identity among a large group. Even if traditional societies had carried out 
the simple step of establishing individual names, recording them still had to be done 
manually. That recording process would be costly and inefﬁcient. For that reason,
6 Regarding the lack of surnames for Turks, Filipinos, and French Jews, as well as other details in 
this section, see: Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have 
Failed by James C. Scott (Yale University Press, 1994).

those societies were still low deﬁnition. A villager with a name and a surname could 
be seen clearly, but once you zoomed out to the city, province, or state, deﬁnition 
would drop. As you try to view a society from higher and higher vantage points, the 
information about the individual becomes increasingly vague and easy to falsify. The 
wider the scope, the lower the deﬁnition of the information. 
A low deﬁnition society leads to opacity in the carrying out of social management. 
This kind of society is cloaked in multiple layers, like a stage behind thick curtains. 
Behind those curtains, all sorts of conspiracies can be hidden. This allows for the sort 
of corruption and abuse of power that we have seen repeated ceaselessly throughout 
history like a chronic and incurable illness. 
Disaster relief became a major problem contributing to the instability of past 
dynasties. When the people were in need, ofﬁcials had to act, but some of the most 
serious cases of corruption happened in the course of carrying out disaster relief. 
The reason for this was that local ofﬁcials could take advantage of the ambiguity 
of records to falsify or forge registers of citizens affected by disasters, then request 
large sums of money, food, and building materials. The central government had no 
way to verify their claims. Many imperial dynasties attempted to close this loophole 
by strengthening their ofﬁcial supervision apparatus. By the time of the Qing (1644– 
1911), the government had set up an authority for inspection of disaster areas and 
affected households, as well as distributing relief. Despite this, the greatest case 
of corruption occurred in Gansu under the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (1735– 
1796). Local ofﬁcials colluded to receive 2.8 million taels of silver in relief funds. 
The fraud involved 113 ofﬁcials and ran for seven years. According to the law of 
the time, anyone convicted in a case of corruption involving more than 1,000 tales 
of silver would be put to death. The list of ofﬁcials to be executed reached 66. The 
bureaucracy of the region was hollowed out.7 The Qianlong Emperor was fairly 
lenient in this case, since he couldn’t bear to execute so many ofﬁcials in a time of 
relative peace and prosperity. 
Unable to fully grasp the truth, humankind faced with their own confusing soci-
eties and with nature could only sigh and say: The Dao that can be described is 
not the true Dao. It is hard to predict what will happen, they said. There are many 
Chinese idioms that say this. One goes: Grasping human nature is like trying to 
glimpse a ﬂower through a morning mist. They had to be content with a superﬁcial 
understanding. Getting close had to sufﬁce. Traditional Chinese philosophy is full of 
this sentiment and it infused the national culture. This approach to ambiguity gave 
birth to the mainstreams of East Asian metaphysics. 
Behind this approach to the world was powerlessness. As we discussed earlier, 
industrial society was an identity society. Anyone entering industrial society needed 
to be able to establish their unique identity. The need to differentiate between indi-
viduals became pressing. We already saw the example of governments maintaining 
photos of individuals in their records. Another example: once people had ﬁxed 
names and surnames, many states began issuing identity cards that included a unique 
number. That brought society into higher deﬁnition. The Amish never progressed

beyond that point. They didn’t keep up with progress. Refusing electricity is a 
superﬁcial sign of their outlook on modern life; refusing social management and 
organization is the real proof of their backwardness. 
From the agricultural era to industrial civilization to our present digital age, our 
image of society is increasing in deﬁnition. If Qianlong had the resources available to 
a modern government, the scale of fraud in Gansu could never have reached such an 
astounding scale: the government would be capable of quickly conﬁrming the number 
of victims and they would have been able to conﬁrm conditions on the ground with 
satellite photography. There’s no way to avoid fraud, but it can be ameliorated. 
The birth of the super ﬁle: single particle governance 
The previous chapters discussed the idea of individual pricing—for each customer, 
you offer a unique price. This is a particularly important characteristic of new 
economy business models. They are based on insights into the consumer. That insight 
is gained by constant data harvesting. 
Sesame Credit uses a similar individual pricing system. It provides loans to 
customers on the basis of credit scores, which formerly relied only on data from 
Alibaba platforms. In order to improve the accuracy of those scores Alibaba began 
obtaining data from other sources. That was done through business agreements, data 
swaps, or sometimes cash purchases. The new data was linked to user identities. This 
was not a simple process, requiring organic linkages based on common characteristics 
in user identities. 
Driven by corporate interests, this type of data integration has ramped up at a 
shocking rate. According to publicly available reports, only 20% of the data being 
used for Sesame Credit data scores is drawn from Alibaba platforms.8 In other words, 
Alibaba has purchased external customers data that exceeds its own internal data by 
four times. 
The purpose of this data integration is to create a super ﬁle for each user (Fig. 4.3). 
The so-called super ﬁle is intended to constantly collect and integrate a user’s data, 
intending to form the most complete picture of them. A company can cooperate with 
many other ﬁrms, sharing a user’s clicking, browsing, and search data from their own 
site, and receiving that information from sites not under their own corporate banner. 
These websites might be offering the same products or services, or they might offer 
upstream or downstream products and services. Apart from that, they can also take 
data from Weibo, WeChat and other social media platforms. That data can be matched 
to their existing data using a phone number to conﬁrm user identity. 
Once a company starts matching disparate data streams with a single user, the 
possibilities are endless. Most people use their phone number or email to register 
for Weibo, so a credit card company can use that information to match social media 
proﬁles to their own customer proﬁles. Once they do this, they can begin to monitor 
their customer’s social media behavior and tailor push notiﬁcations. If a customer 
announces an impending wedding or the birth of a child, new marketing opportunities 
are opened up. Marriage means buying a house, buying a car, and planning a wedding,
8 Wang (2016).

Fig. 4.3 Three types of data that industry are setting out to connect 
and babies need diapers, a crib, powdered milk, and clothes... After a year or so, the 
kid will need a stroller. When the child is three, they might need books. When 
they’re four, it’s time to start planning for kindergarten, and then elementary school. 
Basically, the child will have different needs at each stage of its life. It goes beyond 
what I’ve just listed. There are specialized researchers working on how to market 
based on the data that they integrate into their own customer proﬁles. 
A piece of information or data can be converted into a lifelong marketing 
opportunity. There’s no doubt that companies will ﬂock to this. 
Basically, nearly all B2C companies are attempting to create user super ﬁles 
that can integrate data from numerous sources. The data points that link the data are 
identiﬁcation numbers, phone numbers, email addresses, and other unique identiﬁers. 
This looks a bit like a tanghulu, the popular Northern Chinese snack, which has a 
row of haws fruit stuck on a wooden stick. Each piece of data is like one of the haws 
on the stick. 
Although the integration of data is invisible and seamless, and the user will never 
realize what’s happening, it’s happening every day. The desire of company’s to inte-
grate all data is very strong. In the agricultural era, farmers fought over land, and a 
similar battle is now taking place in the digital industry over data. Farmers could go 
in front of a judge to explain their case. “I’m not being greedy,” the farmer might 
plead, “but I want to connect the pieces of land I own.” The question is: how far do 
you go to allow the connection of those separate tracts of land? This request could 
be extended limitlessly. The same could be asked of today’s digital companies. They 
might say: “I am not being greedy, but I want to connect the data I own.” Just like 
with land, requests to link data could be extended limitlessly. 
Companies want to integrate user data with a super ﬁle, but governments could do 
the same. Different departments within a government possess different data on indi-
viduals, so it makes sense to link them together in a super ﬁle. A citizen’s educational, 
medical, transportation, welfare, tax, criminal, and commercial could be threaded 
together. This super ﬁle will sum up a person’s life, from cradle to grave. The database 
will continually collect and organize new data. Governments can rely on this data

Fig. 4.4 The structure and data required to build a super ﬁle 
and AI to carry out lifelong recordkeeping, lifelong analysis, lifelong management, 
and lifelong service (Fig. 4.4). 
In other words, a super ﬁle can allow governments to carry out analysis and 
management with the same detail as companies carrying out individualized pricing. 
In the context of government analysis and management, I call this single particle 
governance. 
The principle of single particle governance is based on using unique patterns in an 
individual’s data. The Chinese word for “principle” is li; according to the Shuowen 
Jiezi, a Han dynasty dictionary, the word originally meant “polishing jade according 
to an analysis of its patterns.” A piece of jade or stone should be polished or cut 
according to its own patterns and lines. By extension, this means that the patterns 
and lines of a piece of jade or stone must be analyzed before making changes in a 
harmonious and orderly fashion. 
With the foundational goal of bringing society into high deﬁnition, single particle 
governance using super ﬁles can make detailed, individualized management a reality. 
One example of this is in taxation: in a cruder national system, taxation can only 
be divided based on income brackets. Each tax bracket pays a different proportional 
rate, but it doesn’t take into account things like how many dependents they have, 
number of children, or cost of living. Those things are outside the purview of a basic 
tax management system. It’s unfair for the head of a large family and a bachelor to 
pay the same tax rate. In countries with a higher degree of management, more data 
points are used to decide taxation more fairly. 
Since 1975, the United States has had an earned income tax credit (EITC). Every 
household pays taxes based on a number of factors, such as the income of a couple, 
number of children, residency, etc. Taxpayers get tax credits as a refund, based on 
their particular circumstances: if they have a higher burden, they receive more in tax 
credit refunds; if they have a lighter burden, they receive less.

Digression: China’s own examples of granular, individualized social manage-
ment 
Since 2017, many cities in China have introduced aggressive policies for main-
taining human resources. The goal is to attract talent, create talent, and main-
tain competitiveness. Carrying out a scheme to attract and foster talent requires 
more than general data; a government must carry out a detailed cross-analysis. 
They must know, for example, how many graduates of local universities get 
jobs in the area, how many are from outside the province, how many are male, 
how many of them have bought a house within three years, etc. The information 
from this cross-analysis can be further partitioned. Once you do that, you can 
track categories like people from out-of-province, engineering students, men, 
graduates of out-of-province universities, or home buyers, ﬁgure out why they 
have decided to stay, then design schemes to keep or attract more people of 
those categories. By recognizing local human resources needs and the concerns 
or anxieties of the talents you hope to attract, a more goal-oriented solution 
can be proposed and management can be more granular. 
Another example is the “targeted poverty alleviation” carried out in China 
since 2013. The Chinese government set a goal of bringing 70 million people 
out of poverty by 2020. “The value, the effectiveness, and the success of these 
programs depended on their precision. This meant accurately understanding the 
situation of poor households and taking targeted, individualized, and granular 
measures to provide assistance. 
Generally speaking, making these classiﬁcations more detailed and individual-
ized is not simple; it’s more than a matter of making an either-or decision about 
whether a person or household belongs in a particular category. Rather than drawing 
crude lines around names on a list, detailed classiﬁcation would require more compli-
cated diagramming, with a gradual, intersectional, overlapping appearance. In the 
language of data analysis, the reﬁnement we’re talking about is inﬁnite partitioning 
and crossover analysis. Lacking enough information and data points to differentiate 
and describe individual circumstances and ambiguous conditions, the analysis cannot 
be ﬁne-tuned: it’s like a hand without thumbs attempting to turn a screw. 
At this point, I’ve reached a conclusion: if a country wants to manage society, it 
must invent an individual unit that can be clearly inspected and identiﬁed. Bringing 
society into higher deﬁnition is a prerequisite for effective governance. Bringing 
society into higher deﬁnition is the basis of reﬁned, individualized, and intelligent 
management. 
Single particle governance will take as its subjects not only the consumers that 
we have talked about at length, or citizens, or vehicles, but also other objects. 
Express courier services have already realized a system of single particle manage-
ment: in the process of shipping an item, each step is recorded in real time, from 
pulling it off the warehouse shelf, to dispatching it, to transferring it between delivery

Fig. 4.5 A high deﬁnition 
society is the foundation of 
reﬁned, individualized, 
intelligent management 
services, to taking it to a customer’s door, to the ﬁnal receipt... The majority of express 
courier services give customers a platform to check the status of a delivery, whenever 
they like. 
We should be careful about using the word “item,” though, since it’s slightly 
ambiguous. Take a bottle of water as an example... Pull two bottles from the same 
box and they become a quantity of the same item, rather than two separate items, 
since their contents and packaging are identical. There is no system to differentiate 
the two bottles. 
But there will be (Fig. 4.5). 
In January of 2014, Alibaba spent around $170 million to buy a 54.3% stake 
in CITIC 21CN. Apart from CITIC 21CN holding the sole license to sell pharma-
ceuticals online, Alibaba also took note of the company’s unique electronic drug 
monitoring code system.9 
In the past, pharmaceuticals could only be grouped by item. Just like the bottle of 
water we used in our last example, there was no way to differentiate two identically 
packaged bottles of pills. The goal of an electronic monitoring system was to give 
each and every pharmaceutical item a unique code. With that code, there could be 
real time tracking and management from the point of manufacture to the point of 
prescription at a drugstore, hospital, or pharmacy. 
In other words, using the unique code on a box of medicine, a customer could 
use their phone to get information on where it was produced, how it was shipped,
9 On February 20th of 2016, the State Food and Drug Administration suspended the implementation 
of the electronic drug monitoring code system, withdrew Alibaba’s operating rights, and announced 
that they would be seeking a third party operator to implement the system. In April 2016, Hong 
Kong’s Securities Regulatory Commission determined that Alibaba’s investment in CITIC 21CN 
violated their regulations.

97
and where it was sold. It would also record who purchased the item. If there was 
any problem with the medication, the regulatory department could quickly determine 
where it was manufactured, where it was sold, and who it was sold to. In the event 
of a recall, there could be absolute accuracy. 
As this technology develops, this kind of single particle granularity might be 
applied to managing the manufacture, distribution, and sales of other commodities, 
such as food. Existing technologies, like radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) could 
be used for this, as well as QR codes. Ten times the information of a traditional 
barcode can be encoded in a QR code, and they can be embedded in video, images, 
and sounds. This is a low cost way to embed a lot of information in a way that 
consumers can access easily. The product and its data will be linked, allowing for 
trajectory management. 
Our modern societies are complex systems, involving countless elements linked 
together. But the key to social management comes down to people, then the vehicles 
and other objects they interact with. These things are the lifeblood ﬂowing through 
society. Single particle governance is an attempt to train a magnifying glass or a 
microscope on society, people, vehicles, and objects. These are inﬁnitesimally tiny 
particles that make up society; single particle governance attempts to separate them 
out for inspection. It could be compared to looking at an ocean: we can only see the 
waves on the surface and the direction of the tide, but single particle governance is 
like being able to analyze a single droplet of seawater. 
This ability is like being able to lock in on a snowﬂake in a blizzard. Snowﬂakes 
all look the same, but the process that forms them gives them each their own unique 
structure. They each fall in a unique path, too, following air current. Each snowﬂake is 
different and moves in a unique trajectory. But our technology at present is like seeing 
through the eyes of God: we can lock onto, track, and differentiate each snowﬂake as 
it falls. This kind of power has been possessed by no government before in history. 
As we have already seen, Internet companies now have many platforms for e-
commerce, social networking, transportation, dining, logistics, etc. With the power 
of granular management, we are at the point where governments will develop a similar 
platform. The mechanisms involved will be similar to those of Internet companies, 
but they will have a deeper and wider source of data to draw from. 
With this platform, governments around the world will have amazing new capa-
bilities in governance. This is already becoming a reality and we are already seeing 
small displays of new capabilities, which should be able to solve problems that 
hitherto seemed insurmountable. 
This new platform is also gradually producing some new problems. This will 
present a problem for pure pragmatism. If these new powers are used inappropri-
ately, they will create a data cage for citizens. This will turn the platform into the 
Panopticon that Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) proposed, where one watchman can 
observe everyone. 
As we enter the age of single particle governance, the ﬁrst to be tossed behind bars 
will be human nature. That holds true for both democratic and autocratic regimes. 
Our understanding of human nature is only general. It’s invisible and imperceptible. 
But that understanding contains contradictions. A new tension has appeared. As data 
rises, human nature recedes.

Don’t Leave it to Luck: The Experience of Governance 
in Ancient China 
Heaven can be guessed at, Earth can be measured. It is only a person’s heart that cannot 
be protected. But to see loyalty crimson as blood, who knows what false words might be 
spoken as ﬂuently as someone plays a ﬂute. They urge you, my lord, to do this and then do 
that, or your wife and you will be as distant as the morning and evening stars. They urge 
you, my lord, to catch a bee, then say you must not catch it, or you and your son will ﬁght 
like jackals and wolves. A ﬁsh at the bottom of the sea and a bird in the sky. As high as it is, 
it can be shot down. As deep as it is, it can be hauled out. When people’s hearts and minds 
are in opposition, no matter how close they are, they cannot be understood. 
This poem by Bai Juyi (772–846) talks about the complex, changeable, elusive 
character of human nature. We have compassion, shame, respect, conscience, and we 
also have joy, rage, likes and dislikes, and various appetites. Human nature is not only 
changeable, switching between love and hate, or good and evil, but it can transform 
as fast as thought. This is the thinking behind the idiom that goes, “A wicked thought 
follows a good thought; a devil in one moment and a saint in the next.” 
What can we use to restrain this instantly changeable human nature? Ethics and 
law attempt to answer this question, but in a low deﬁnition society, they lack precision. 
We can see that not all violations of ethics and morality end up being punished; the 
punishment is not always timely; and the punishment might not always ﬁt the crime. 
It’s from this that we get the human tendency to trust in luck. 
This trust in luck is a challenge to social management. In a country where people 
trust in luck, there is a lack of self-restraint. The government can only rely on law 
enforcement and the courts to keep order and stability. This leads to a large number of 
people becoming two-faced: they behave themselves when they know they’re being 
watched, but not when they think nobody has eyes on them. The crime rate goes up 
and there can be a breakdown in the normal functioning of society. 
This challenge runs through modern human society. Societies in the East and the 
West have thought about it differently, and they have provided different solutions, 
reﬂecting differences between the two civilizations. Eastern cultures relied on a 
belief in the original goodness of human nature to establish the four cardinal virtues 
of humanity, justice, propriety, and wisdom; Western cultures’ belief that men are 
born wicked shaped their creation of laws and charters. 
Digression: How giving up on luck can be an important step in self-
improvement 
The Buddhist monk Hong Yi (1880–1942) believed that good luck was a long 
term detriment to personal development. For example, if you get away with 
making an unkind remark, you might do it again; if you break the law to earn a 
proﬁt and get away with it, you might do it again. This sounds like good luck, 
but it actually leads to disaster and suffering because they don’t teach us how

4.2 Don’t Leave it to Luck: The Experience of Governance in Ancient China

things actually work. Luck is not in accordance with the objective rules that 
govern the world. If you draw conclusions from your good luck and hope for 
more of the same, you will certainly be disappointed.10 
Zeng Guofan (1807–1872) held a similar point of view. After some setbacks 
in his career as a bureaucrat, other people blamed it on his bad look, but he 
disagreed. He said that some ofﬁcials received praise for their writing when 
it was undeserved, but no truly ﬁne writing had ever been completely over-
looked.11 He vowed to improve the level of his own writing through hard 
work. Zeng Guofan was an orthodox Confucian, so he was familiar with the 
Master’s lines: “To give oneself earnestly to the duties due to men, and, while 
respecting spiritual beings keep aloof from them, may be called wisdom.” But 
he often included in letters to his younger brother an admonition to keep an 
eye on spiritual beings, since they know everything we think, do, and say; we 
can fool people, but we might not be able to fool the gods. What he was telling 
his brother was that he had to work honestly and work hard, never relying on 
a good opportunity to come along or good luck to save the day. 
Past generations of statesmen have attempted to dislodge the belief among their 
subjects in luck. We can see that in the selection from the Commentary of Zuo that 
begins the chapter: if a country’s common people believe in luck, it will be bad for the 
nation; if a country is ruled wisely, then the people will know that their good fortune 
has nothing to do with getting lucky. Xunzi argues in On Enriching a State that the 
ideal society is one in which “no ofﬁcial is promoted without merit; no subjects 
earn anything through mere good fortune.” What Xunzi means is that no bureaucrats 
should reach their rank without merit and hard work, and that none of the common 
people should sit around waiting for good fortune to ﬁnd them. During a particularly 
tough time in the Song Dynasty, imperial ofﬁcial Fan Zhongyan (989–1052) took 
part in the Qingli Reforms, presenting his own ten-point proposal for reforming 
government. The second of those proposals was to suppress belief in leaving things 
up to good fortune. 
The reason that it was so high on the list in a discussion of national policy is that 
politicians had realized this way of thinking could be a disaster. Of course, there 
were examples in history of people doing bad things and getting away with it, but it 
isn’t good for this mindset to become consensus.
10 The original quote is: “The most unfortunate thing in life is when one makes an indiscreet remark 
and gets away with it; when one fails to carry out a plan but suffers no setback; when one puts in 
no effort but gains reward. Later, one will begin to perceive this turn of events as normal and is not 
disturbed by it. This is a tragedy, and disaster will come from it.” A Record of Master Hongyi’s 
Maxims. (1997, May). Anhui Literature and Art Publishing House.

Let’s look at some examples from soccer crowd management. The cost of orga-
nizing and keeping order at a match is extremely high. One of the reasons for this 
is that so much uncivilized behavior goes on in the stands. People throw things, like 
bottles, lighters, and coins onto the ﬁeld, for example. The language used by audi-
ences can be inappropriate or provocative, leading to mass disturbances and riots. 
No matter where you are in the world, soccer matches have a heavy police presence. 
According to statistics on soccer security in the 1990s, Sweden was spending 7.5 
million Euros a year, while the top division in Italy was dropping 40 million Euros. 
The reason for the behavior of soccer fans is that they are in a crowd. No matter how 
many police are there, it is difﬁcult for offenders to be held accountable. 
Since the advent of surveillance cameras, the situation has improved markedly. 
Sweden was among the ﬁrst countries to introduce the new technology, installing 
cameras in three major stadiums in the 1990s. Unruly and illegal behavior was 
reduced by 65%. After that success, the Swedish Football Association made a rule 
requiring any stadium that hosted league matches to install surveillance cameras.12 
This initiative cut down on the cost of policing. 
The ubiquity of surveillance has uncovered some unbelievable things happening 
at stadiums. 
At a baseball game in Atlanta in July of 2015, two sisters were eavesdropping on 
the text messages of a woman seated in front of them. The woman had her husband 
beside her, but unbeknownst to him, she was texting the man she was having an affair 
with. The two sisters immediately took out their own phones to document the text 
messages. When the game ended, they handed a note to the husband: “Your wife is 
cheating on you. Look at the messages under ‘Nancy.’ It’s really a man named Mark 
Allen.” She apologized for being the bearer of bad news and offered to send pictures 
conﬁrming the text messages. Half an hour later, the husband contacted the sisters 
to ask for the photos.13 
This is not the ﬁrst time that an incident has happened. In December of 2014, while 
a man and his pregnant wife were watching a Detroit Lions game, an eavesdropper 
noticed that she was sending texts to another man. The eavesdropper handed a note 
to the husband and later shared the story on Facebook. With cameras everywhere, it 
can feel like we’re constantly being watched from above. Without surveillance tools 
and methods, it’s hard to imagine good fortune ever leading to these affairs being 
exposed (Fig. 4.6). 
We’re living in a different age. 
We are currently entering an era of universal recording. That means recording 
equipment will be increasingly small and increasingly common; recording methods 
will be increasingly convenient; recording will take place everywhere and by many 
means. In the past, we had to decide what to record; now and in the future, we will 
have to decide what not to record. With the universalization of recording, everyone 
is recording everyone else. We’re entering a society where nothing is left up to luck.

The Power of the Individual: Everyone Holds a Sword 
and Everyone Is Held a Swordpoint 
Ancient Greek literature is the source of the story of “The Sword of Damocles.” In 
the 4th century BC, Damocles was a courtier in the court of Dionysius II of Syracuse. 
He was envious of the king. When Damocles ﬂattered him about his immense power, 
Dionysius II offered to switch places with him for a day. He told him that he could 
experience what it was like to be king. 
At a banquet that day, Damocles was enjoying his time on the throne. He happened 
to look up, though, and noticed that a sharp sword was hanging over his head from a 
single hair of a horse’s tail. Watching the sword hanging perilously over his head, in 
danger of falling at any moment, he immediately understood what the king was trying 
to tell him: with immense power comes responsibility and risk. If a ruler mismanages 
his people, he could face serious consequences, up to death. 
Behind powerful forces there are generally massive risks lurking. These dangers 
might appear at any time, but there’s no way to predict them. This is the power of 
“The Sword of Damocles.” In today’s world, anyone can pull out a phone and record 
what’s going on around them, turning a ﬂeeting moment into a stream of data. That 
data can travel around the world in an instant. This is an era where everyone has a 
camera and anyone can be a reporter; everyone can be recorded, too, especially public 
ﬁgures. Now that recording is much easier and becoming universal, the individual 
has greater power; the borders of the individual are expanding; and it means that the 
individual has more power to counteract the system. 
This is like everyone holding the sword, but also sitting under the sword. This will 
not only change the behavior patterns of individuals, but also social management. 
In March of 2012, Evergrande chairman Xu Jiayin attended the National People’s 
Congress and People’s Political Consultative Congress (the Two Sessions) of the 
Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) as a delegate. He did 
so while wearing a Hermès belt. Photos of Xu Jiayin began circulating online and

social media users began digging into the extravagant wardrobes and accessories of 
Two Sessions attendees. They discovered one representative in a brand new Pucci 
suit, another carrying a 100,000 yuan Hermès handbag... This led to lively discussion 
online. After this incident, the delegates quickly adjusted their behavior. As far as 
wardrobe and accessories, the Two Sessions returned to being a simple, low-key 
affair. Luxury goods, like fur coats, designer bags, belts, and glasses stopped being 
worn by Two Sessions attendees. 
“Brother Wristwatch” Yang Dacai might be the best proof that the space for leaving 
it to luck has shrunk. On the 26th of August, 2012, a major trafﬁc accident on the 
Baotou-Maoming Highway resulted in 36 deaths and Yang Dacai went to inspect 
the scene in his role as head of the Shaanxi province work safety administration. 
His cheerful demeanor in photographs at the accident scene was roundly condemned 
online. Social media users went a step further, starting up one of the online vigi-
lante campaigns colorfully referred to in Chinese as a “human ﬂesh search engine.” 
Yang had ﬁrst been nicknamed “Director Smiles,” but his nickname was changed to 
“Brother Wristwatch” when his collection of expensive watches was uncovered by 
browsing previous photo ops. He had worn at least ﬁve different, highly valuable 
watches. Even more suspicion fell on him. 
Yang Dacai was forced to respond. “In the past ten years,” he said, “I have indeed 
purchased ﬁve watches. I bought them myself, out of my own salary. All of this has 
previously been reported to the Party disciplinary supervision department.” 
His response prompted even more interest. Social media users turned up photos of 
Yang Dacai with a sixth watch, then a seventh. That continued until 11 watches had 
been found. Professionals set to work identifying them and putting prices on them. 
The watches included pieces from Rolex, Omega, Bulgari, and Vacheron-Constantin, 
valued in the hundreds of thousands. 
The story of Yang Dacai shows us that even a fragmentary piece of data has a lot 
of potential energy. He was not only raked over the coals and given the nickname 
“Brother Wristwatch” but also faced investigation by provincial Party discipline 
ofﬁcials. Yang Dacai was expelled from the Party and his case was transferred to the 
courts. In September 2013, he was found guilty of accepting bribes and possessing 
large amounts of property that he could prove the source of. He went to prison for 
14 years. 
Having learned from the situation of “Wristwatch Brother” Yang Dacai, some 
other ofﬁcials stopped wearing expensive watches or ﬂashy accessories in public. 
At a media training event in Foshan in 2013, one of the experts advised, “It’s now 
best to avoid a necklace or chain, too, since people are looking for those, as well 
as watches.” Sharp-eyed social media users began catching tan lines on the wrists 
of ofﬁcials, a sure sign that they had ditched their watches just ahead of taking the 
podium at a press conference. 
The fall of Yang Dacai is a landmark event in public participation in social gover-
nance. Right of supervision is granted to citizens by law, but, since most people 
have no idea how it might be exercised, it mostly remains academic. The spread of 
recording technology means that citizens can learn the facts about people and events. 
This is an ability that has been entrusted to everyone.

103
In July of 2016, the Ministry of Public Security afﬁrmed this right of supervision, 
telling its ofﬁcers to get accustomed to public observation and being ﬁlmed while 
doing their jobs. In September of 2016, the Ministry of Public Security issued their 
“Provisions Concerning the Collection, Extraction, Review, and Judgment of Elec-
tronic Data in the Handling of Criminal Cases,” providing law enforcement with the 
authority to use electronic data in court. This data could include web pages, blogs, 
Weibo posts, WeChat Moments, photographs, music, etc. 
Chinese police will eventually get used to policing under a lens. This is an example 
of progress in social governance thinking and will provide new solutions to long-
standing issues. As networked devices and the Internet penetrate fully, and mobile 
phones and surveillance cameras become ubiquitous, countless details about the oper-
ation of society will be recorded; the role of data will become increasingly important; 
and these situations will become the “new normal.” 
4.4 
Data Is Incontrovertible: A World Where Nothing Is 
Left to Luck 
As we have already seen, data is pressing down on human nature, challenging its 
tendency to leave things to luck. If people give up on the psychology of ﬂukes, the 
world will be a safer and more peaceful place. 
In August of 2016, Gao Chengyong was arrested in Baiyin, Gansu and charged 
with the vicious murder and rape of eleven women in Baiyin and Baotou. 
Prior to this test, although the police had repeatedly locked down thh area around 
crime scenes, Gao Chengyong had evaded capture. I noted that what allowed the 
police to nab Gao Chengyong was the use of a Y-chromosome DNA test. This is a 
test that can determine the paternal lineage of a person, as well as revealing other 
paternal kinship relationships. Y-chromosome DNA allowed the police to link a 
suspected serial killer to a member of Gao Chengyong’s family in their custody 
for unrelated crimes. That allowed them to quickly narrow down the list of potential 
suspects. When Gao Chengyong was captured, the police were able to carry out other 
analysis to determine he was the culprit. Cases that had been unsolved for years were 
suddenly broken wide open. 
Looking over the history of the ﬁght against crime, we have no choice but to admit 
that limited investigation techniques often led justice to be served late or not at all. 
However, as big data technology advances and every step we take is increasingly 
recorded, there will be a revolution in the domain of public security. As I see it, 
police work will be increasingly dominated by data collection and analysis. 
The Baiyin serial killer case is not an isolated case. A similarly legendary example 
of police work took place in 2016 in Hangzhou, where I have been living for the past 
several years. 
The Zhijiang Garden Murders took place in 2003. A man surnamed Yu entered a 
house, killed three occupants, and then disappeared without a trace. That year, the

Fig. 4.7 The “Evidence Cloud” of Zhejiang is already sharing data across multiple jurisdictions 
legendary Chinese-American forensic scientist Henry Lee visited Hangzhou for the 
ﬁrst time and was asked about the case. He had no solution, but said this: “Give it 
enough time and the case will be solved.” 
Some might sense a certain helplessness in this remark, but Henry Lee was aware 
that technology was making progress. 
In the 1990s, Hangzhou police started collecting “organic evidence” and intro-
duced a management system for it. In 2008, this collection and management system 
was spread to police stations across the city. It was capable of collecting images, 
DNA, ﬁngerprints, palm prints, footprints, and shoe sole patterns. In 2012, all of 
the data in this system began to be transferred to an “Evidence Cloud,” so that any 
suspect’s data could be integrated for large-scale comparison (Fig. 4.7). 
In September 2015, at a restaurant in Zhuji, about 40 miles south of Hangzhou, a 
man was arrested over an argument that led to a stabbing. A DNA sample was taken by 
local police. With that DNA information on an interjurisdictional “Evidence Cloud,” 
Hangzhou police were able to determine that the man from Zhuji was the same man 
that had carried out the Zhijiang Garden Murders. The identity of the mysterious Mr. 
Yu was conﬁrmed.14 
You might say they got lucky. But solving the case became inevitable after the 
technology was popularized. 
Again, the solving of the Baiyin serial killer case and the Zhijiang Garden Murders 
are not isolated incidents. They are part of a trend in policing that has also been seen 
in the United States. In the ﬁrst half of 2018, American police cracked a cold case 
that was quite similar to the Baiyin serial killer. 
Between 1975 and 1986, a sick killer had stalked California. He was suspected 
in at least 12 murders and 45 rapes. Investigators chased the “Golden State Killer” 
for twenty years, looked into thousands of suspects, but came up with nothing.15 
14 Chen (2016). 
15 Haag (2018).

4.4 Data Is Incontrovertible: A World Where Nothing Is Left to Luck
105
In December 2017, a detective in California came up with a new solution. The 
killer’s DNA was on ﬁle, so he decided to upload it to the genealogy website 
GEDmatch. This is a platform that analyzes genetic information and has helped 
people ﬁnd shadowy ancestors or lost relatives. The website quickly turned up some 
genetic matches for the killer. Having made this important discovery, the list of 
suspects was narrowed from thousands of names down to one family. Investigators 
further narrowed that down to one person: 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo. In 
April of 2018, the “Golden State Killer” was ﬁnally brought to justice. 
This is almost the same as the situation in Baiyin, but there’s another American 
case that looks even closer to what happened in Hangzhou. 
On July 7th, 1991, police in San Bernardino, California found a body stuffed 
under the mattress. They determined the identity of the victim and also picked up a 
ﬁngerprint from their car. No match was found in the local police database. The case 
went cold for two decades. 
Beginning in the 1970s, American law enforcement began building an Integrated 
Automated Fingerprint Identiﬁcation System (IAFIS). This is a system to match 
ﬁngerprints taken across the entire country. It built up a database over three decades 
and has the ﬁngerprints of 70 million criminals and 40 million ordinary citizens, as 
well as images of faces, scars, and tattoos. IAFIS data is constantly growing and 
improving. 
In 2010, the ﬁngerprints from the 1991 San Bernardino murder case were entered 
into IAFIS. After ﬁve hours of analysis, the system spit out a list of suspects. One 
of them was living in Tennessee, thousands of miles away from San Bernardino. 
After further manual analysis and interrogation, Arrowood confessed. In 2014, he 
was convicted of ﬁrst degree murder and sent to prison for 25 years.16 
The Arrowood case and the Zhijiang Garden Murders case both show the use of 
interjurisdictional data connectivity. You can imagine how many cases went unsolved 
in a time before law enforcement data was connected. If a murderer got away with 
a crime by good luck, justice would never be served. 
That’s another thing that links these two cases. After the murders, both criminals 
ran far away. That’s typical for criminals everywhere. 
Where do they run to? In former times, criminals could run to the wilderness and 
take refuge in a temple. Their remote location made Buddhist temples and Daoist 
shrines ideal for this. They became known as a places that “sheltered evil people 
and countenanced evil practices.” There is another famous phrase: “On the endless 
sea of suffering, repentance is the only harbor; if you reform an evildoer, you reach 
Buddhahood instantly.” This suggests something about the easy relationship between 
religious sites and criminals. Of course, heroes might also hide out in those places, 
but they kept a low proﬁle, too. It is because of a lack of data or records that no one 
could easily know the situation or history of people in hiding. 
However, nowadays even some monks ﬁnd themselves caught up in the data net. In 
2012, police at Haozikou in Neijiang, Sichuan began carrying out the “Standardized

Address and Three Facts” program, recording addresses and other census information 
from residents. Police were surprised to learn that one of the monks in the jurisdiction 
was the suspect in a fraud case. In 2016, police in Fengyang, Anhui discovered a 
wanted criminal through facial recognition and were amazed to discover that it was 
Zhang Liwei, head of a local temple, vice chairman of the local Buddhist Association, 
and member of the CPPCC. He had committed a triple murder in the Northeast in 
2000 and run off to Anhui. After becoming a monk, his life had gone smoothly, and 
he was riding the crest of success.17 
In a time without data, there’s no way to check a person’s background. When we 
had less data, a person’s background could be selectively recorded on paper, but it 
would often be left moldering in an archive. Nowadays, there is a record of most 
things we do. That record is far more durable than paper records, and it’s stored in 
the cloud. At any time, it can be analyzed again and integrated with other data. Data 
is like a lie detector. Any data that comes up as “irregular” can prove an illegal act. 
I worked for eight years in public security for a ministry in charge of border 
defense. I investigated maritime criminal cases. Ten years ago, if someone with a 
small craft committed a crime, it was very easy for them to escape punishment by 
simply moving to another jurisdiction. Last year, a former coworker let me know that 
this method of escape is no longer feasible. Nowadays, all provincial data is online. 
If the suspect moved from Shanwei to Shantou, the police in Shantou could quickly 
determine their identity and force them to pay their ﬁnes. 
When data about an individual is isolated, that individual’s behaviors are also 
isolated. If someone is good at disguising their identity, they can quickly become a 
completely new person. When data is connected, the individual’s behaviors are also 
connected; data and behaviors are mutually connected and provide mutual conﬁr-
mation. Police investigation and interviews are all about collecting data, connecting 
information, and ﬁnding inconsistencies. 
Digression: how to use data to uncover money laundering 
During my work at Alibaba, our connections with the government usually came 
through law enforcement departments. The Public Security Bureau often hoped 
to obtain transaction data from Alibaba platforms as a way to conﬁrm evidence 
or seek new evidence. Transactions on e-commerce platforms are data-based, so 
they can be quickly tracked. Beyond simple tracking, the transactions can also 
be analyzed and their patterns used to make forecasts. Anti-money laundering 
experts can identify signs of an illegal banking exchange: an account receiving 
and sending money to a large number of other accounts, the addresses linked 
to those accounts have a large geographic distance between them, many trans-
actions in a single day, consistent deposits and intermittent payments, and the 
sums of money being transferred divisible by the daily exchange rate. At that

point, further manual monitoring can be done. In the ﬁrst half of 2017 alone, 
the data analysis center of Ant Financial referred more than 300 suspicious 
transactions to the Public Security Bureau. The space allowed for economic 
crimes, such as money laundering and tax evasion is continually shrinking. 
Data is incontrovertible. By making wise use of big data, we can enter a more 
secure era. 
According to statistics, the detection rate for homicides by Chinese law enforce-
ment exceeded 95% over the past ﬁve years. Compared to numbers in 2012, the 
number of serious violent crime cases nationwide in 2016 dropped by 43%. In August 
of 2017, the government of Zhejiang held a press conference to announce that their 
homicide detection rate was above 99%. In the ﬁrst half of 2017, the number of public 
security cases in the province dropped 7.76% year-on-year; criminal cases dropped 
by 28.59%. My friend at the Public Security Bureau explained it like this: “Big data 
and new tech is so powerful. If we get a case, we solve it. After that, we can start 
working on cold cases. We’re either solving cases or waiting for cases.” 
In the past, when darkness covered half the Earth each day, no electric light 
disturbed it. When the sun set, perverts and criminals came out to stalk their prey 
like wild beasts. Traveling at night was a risk. There was a good chance that you would 
lose your possessions, if not your life. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) 
once wrote that what he feared most was lying alone in bed at night. He wasn’t afraid 
of ghosts. He was worried someone would come in, smash his head in, and take his 
money. A dark night is the perfect cover for crime. “At night,” an Italian proverb tells 
us, “the housecat becomes the leopard.” Historical data proves this to be true: in a 
time without electricity, people came out at night, and 75% of thefts took place after 
sunset. 
At the beginning of the 19th century, Europeans invented the gas street lamp. 
This was a turning point in human security. In 1823, 40,000 street lamps illuminated 
more than 300 kilometers of London streets. Other cities soon followed their example, 
including Paris, Berlin, and Boston. Whenever there was a riot in a city, the ﬁrst target 
of bad elements was always the street lights. Jane Austen (1775–1817) once observed 
that gas street lamps had done more for crime prevention than anything else over the 
previous thousand years.18 
In the 1880s, Edison gave us the light bulb and built the ﬁrst power company in 
New York. That was the beginning of electriﬁcation in cities. Electricity brought a 
stable and durable lighting source to the city. The sun lit the day; electricity lit the 
night. The only difference between day and night was the source of illumination. 
Soon, sociologists began to observe that the crime rate would drop in any part of 
the city where lighting was installed. This was further proof that criminals were 
making use of the cover of darkness. Today, data has the same effect. The ubiquity 
of surveillance cameras and the rapid integration of data are like a new street light,
18 See Jane Austen’s Sanditon, an unﬁnished novel begun 1917.

illuminating the dark side of human nature, letting everyone know that they can’t 
leave anything up to luck. Data is giving birth to a safer society. Our generation will 
witness human history’s most substantial and complete decline in crime rates.

The Force of Data: How Universal 
Recording “Warps” Human Nature 
Abstract Humans and animals each have their own respective strengths. Wind and 
ﬁre are powerful, too. Everything has its own energy inside of it. Is data an exception? 
This chapter attempts to deﬁne “data force” and lay out how it affects human nature. 
As we already know, a force can be intangible; we know that an object can exert force 
on another object without coming into direct contact with it. Like gravity, magnetism, 
the attraction that holds particles together, and centripetal force, data force is also 
invisible. If human society is a vast river on which we all ﬂoat, there are two ships 
leading our armadas: the ﬁrst is reputation and the second is beneﬁts. The beginning 
of this book focused on the latter, explaining how the production and use of data 
can potentially be of beneﬁt to the individual. This chapter focuses on the former, 
discussing how data force inﬂuences humanity’s quest for fame and good name. 
5.1 In All of Our Science the Pursuit Least Developed 
but the Most Valuable is the Study of Mankind Itself 
As I wrote earlier in the book, the digitization of everything is allowing us to bring 
society into higher deﬁnition, making possible single particle governance; universal 
recording will hold people accountable for their behavior, so they will learn to regulate 
it; and we have seen the possibility of a “world without thieves,” where people believe 
that social management will win out over their own good luck. 
Long before the digital age, we already had a tradition of recording things. The 
ﬁrst tool was writing. Talking about forces, there is certainly a force present in the 
written word that can act on human nature. 
In Chinese history, recording events was once regarded as something holy. Ancient 
men once said, “Understand the past, to draw lessons for the future.”1 There is a 
wealth of knowledge and experience contained in historical records; we must use 
history as a teacher. Whether we are talking about the thinkers of the late Zhou or 
the rhetoricians of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, when it came 
time to argue their case to the elites of the nation, they worked from historical events.

The Force of Data: How Universal Recording “Warps” Human Nature
The words and actions of ancient sages formed the orthodoxy of every philosophical 
school. Anybody that wanted to be thought of as a learned man could not afford 
to be ignorant of the historical records. This gives us the Chinese idea of fagu, or  
“imitating the ancients.”
The record of past events became shi, or history. A position was created for what 
was called shiguan, a term that goes beyond mere historian, describing an imperial 
ofﬁcial whose job it was to maintain and compile historical documents and records. 
Among ancient civilizations, China put the most emphasis on the study of history. 
“Among all academic disciplines in China,” Liang Qichao (1873–1929) said, “the 
study of history is the most advanced. And among nations studying history, China is 
the most advanced.” 
Before the shiguan, there were shamans occupying a similar position.2 This is 
more proof of the quasi-religious nature of the ofﬁcial historian’s role. They also 
held a monopoly over this power to record: beginning in the Sui (581–618), it was 
forbidden for anyone outside of the ofﬁcial historians to record dynastic histories 
or comment on historical ﬁgures.3 The right to record became indivisible from the 
authority of a monarch. 
Recording events is not a passive act. It’s a generative act. It turns events into 
data. That data is dynamic. I call the power contained in data a force. Like the force 
of gravitational waves, we can prove its existence, even if we can’t see it. Data force 
can inﬂuence and change human behavior and tendencies, and it has had a role in 
and even created many great changes in human history. 
As we saw in the last chapter, humanity is moving toward an age when nobody 
believes good luck will get them out of a jam. It’s going to be a safer age because 
of the deterrent ability inherent in universal recording. This all comes down to data 
force. This chapter focuses on how this data force will affect the human desire for 
fame and reputation. 
Humanity realized early on that their lives were limited. The only way to span 
time was through achieving posterity—having your name and deeds recorded in 
history. Confucius said: “A man of noble character hates the idea of his name not 
being mentioned after his death.” Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) said this: “Those whose 
deeds are recorded in books shine as brightly as the sun and stars.” The meaning of 
these two quotes is that right-thinking people should be concerned about posterity; 
and the only way to be celebrated posthumously is to have your name written in the 
history books. The Tang Dynasty history Liu Zhiji (661–721) explained this very 
clearly:
2 The term wuzhu, or shaman, in ancient times referred to those involved in the supernatural, 
including presiding over religious ceremonies and funerals, and later to soothsayers. 
3 The original lines, taken from the Book of Sui, the ofﬁcial history of the dynasty, composed in 
the Tang, say: “Common composition of court history, passing judgment on historical ﬁgures is 
forbidden”. 

5.2 The Bane of an Emperor’s Existence
111
Our lives are balanced between heaven and earth. We are like mayﬂies, like the glimpse of 
a white horse as it runs by a gap in the wall—passing in a ﬂash. We struggle to leave behind 
a proud legacy but face the possibility of meeting death without having made a name for 
ourselves. From the emperor on high to the lowliest subject, from the ministers of the court 
to the men of the mountains, everyone is in tireless pursuit of renown. Why is this the case? 
Everyone wants immortality. What does that mean? Immortality is having your name passed 
down through history.4 
It is in our nature to hope that we might achieve posterity that stretches beyond our 
own limited lifespans. It’s instinctual to want to be remembered by later generations. 
This is especially true for the ruling class. The early ofﬁcial historians recognized 
this natural inclination and attempted to construct systemic barriers to entry, allowing 
their monarch to maintain authority even over posthumous remembrance. This is what 
is meant by the phrase “governing through history.”5 
In China’s long history, the idea of using history to control the present appears 
and disappears. From this concept, we can deduce the risks of recording history. The 
instrument of recording history was the brush, but it could be wielded like a blade. 
Recording history was a matter of life and death. In the background of these records, 
we know that blood was spilled. 
5.2 The Bane of an Emperor’s Existence 
In 960 AD, the Fine Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms were both reaching their end. This 
was an era of great division in Chinese history. In that year, troops of the Later Zhou 
marched out to Chen Bridge in Henan and abruptly declared that military governor 
Zhao Kuangyin (917–975) was the true emperor. Zhao Kuangyin declined the new 
position at ﬁrst, but then accepted it, leading troops back to take the capital. With the 
military behind him, there was no resistance; the emperor was forced to abdicate. 
This was the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty. 
Most historians now believe that the Chen Bridge Mutiny was a coup d’etat 
meticulously planned by Zhao Kuangyin. When he ascended the throne, he became 
a prudent, effective leader. He was praised by later generations for bringing to an 
end the chaos of the age, leading to a new era of stability and progress. He became 
known as Emperor Taizu of Song. 
Emperor Taizu was a man of modest temperament, who enjoyed his leisure time. 
He could probably be called China’s ﬁrst soccer star—he was fond of playing cuju, a 
game strikingly similar to soccer, with his subordinates. His other hobby was hunting 
birds in his yard.
4 This is from Liu Zhiji’s Shitong, or  Generality of Historiography, composed in the sixth century. 
5 Many historians of the past, including Jiao Hong (1540–1620) of the Ming, as well as modern 
historians, like Liu Yizheng (1879–1956) believed that ofﬁcial historians had a kind of “historical 
authority” that could restrict the monarch’s power. They called this “governing through history.”.

The Force of Data: How Universal Recording “Warps” Human Nature
One day, he was out in his yard, hunting with a slingshot. He was closing in on 
his prey when he heard footsteps behind him. He was told by an aide that a certain 
minister had an urgent matter to report. Zhao Kuangyin waved him off, saying that 
it could wait. The aide insisted that the matter was very urgent. Zhao Kuangyin 
ﬁnally tossed aside his slingshot and went back to the court. As soon as he heard the 
minister’s report, he lost his temper, asking why he was being disturbed over such a 
pedestrian concern. The minister said ﬁrmly back to him: “However urgent, I believe 
any state concern should take precedence over hunting birds.” 
Zhao Kuangyin lost his temper and roared back at the minister: “If I can’t hunt 
birds, maybe I’ll hunt you.” He reached for an ax handle that happened to be lying 
on the table, raised it, and began bringing it down on the minister’s face. A pair of 
busted teeth fell in the pool of blood at the minister’s feet. The minister did not cry 
out, however, and simply bent down to pick up his teeth. That made Zhao Kuangyin 
even angrier. “What are you picking those up for?” he demanded. “Are you trying to 
put together a lawsuit against me?”. 
“I know I don’t have the right to bring a lawsuit,” the minister said, “but I preserve 
these so that the court historian will be able to record things accurately.” 
As soon as he heard that, Zhao Kuangyin reacted like the Monkey King when his 
master chanted the incantation to tighten the golden band around his head. He forgot 
all about hunting for birds. 
Unbelievably, the court history really did record this incident. A hundred years 
later, Sima Guang (1019–1086), more famous for his Comprehensive Mirror in Aid 
of Governance, recorded the incident in his Records of Rumors from Sushui. He  
concluded the anecdote with a note that Zhao Kuangyin was both horriﬁed and 
elated. He was horriﬁed that the incident might be recorded, but elated to discover 
that his loyal minister’s chief concern was accurate historical record. Zhaog Kuangyin 
calmed down and called for the minister to be gifted gold, silver, and silk. This was 
intended as a reward, and also to comfort him. 
I will explain the shiguan system here. From ancient times, the daily life of the 
monarch had been recorded. The Book of Rites explained it like this: “Movements to 
the left; speech to the right.” In other words, what the emperor did was recorded by 
an ofﬁcial historian that sat to his left, and what he said was recorded by an ofﬁcial 
historian that sat to his right. “The Emperor’s actions must be recorded; good and ill, 
successes and failures; there can be no exceptions.”6 That means that every single 
thing that took place had to be written down. 
All of these records were called The Record of the Emperor’s Daily Activities. 
From the time of Emperor Wu of Han, China ofﬁcially began recording a Private 
Record of the Emperor’s Daily Activities. In the Jin Dynasty, there came to be various 
secretaries in charge of recording various elements of the Record. When the emperor

Eastern Han. 

5.2 The Bane of an Emperor’s Existence

died, the Record would be passed to the shiguan, who would edit it into a coherent 
history and pass it on to the next emperor. It provided guidance to the next generation 
and also served as a memorial to the late emperor. 
Looking at it from a theoretical point of view, the Record has a number of unique 
traits. The ﬁrst trait is that it’s true: it records true events, large and small, as they 
happened, without editorial or commentary. The second trait is that it cannot be 
changed, or, rather, that the cost of changing it is high. The third trait is that the 
monarch themselves were unable to look at it; letting the monarch see the Record 
was a violation of the ancestral system and would be opposed by all ministers of the 
court; keeping the Record from the monarch was a guarantee of its independence. 
The existence of the Record was a major constraint on the monarch. One day, 
Emperor Taizu of Song returned to his palace and went to sit alone in his room, 
brooding. A eunuch named Tang Ji’en asked him the reason. Taizu said: “I was too 
hasty in the early morning session. I made errors. The historian recorded all of it. I 
have good reason to be upset, don’t I?”.7 
Taizu’s reaction shows us that although the authority to record was not power in 
the traditional sense, it still had the power to shape how the monarch spoke and acted. 
In the traditional bureaucratic system, the monarch had a heavenly mandate, placing 
him beyond earthly authority. That system meant that there were few restrictions on 
his authority. The Record not only changed the monarch’s behavior, but could even 
change the trajectory of the feudal imperial system. 
Although many monarchs expressed their dissatisfaction with this, it was all for 
naught. Think about the system that a monarch of that time would have lived under: 
“All land under heaven belongs to the emperor, and all people living on it are his 
subjects.” Now, imagine that there is a method to record all of the monarch’s actions 
and words, but he can’t exercise authority over it… It had to have been an annoyance. 
Even before Emperor Taizu of Song, Emperor Taizong of Tang had already 
expressed his dissatisfaction. 
Li Shimin (598–649)—the Emperor’s personal name—came to power through 
less than legal means. In 626, he stormed into the court and his troops began killing 
relatives of the Emperor. This is called the Xuanwu Gate Coup. Li Shimin took the 
throne and kicked off a golden age in Chinese history. 
The great military man Li Shimin feared his deeds being recorded, too. The 
Essence of Politics in the Zhenguan Reign records that Li Shimin admitted to not 
wanting to speak often in court: “When I attend the morning session, I must weigh 
each word, considering whether I am speaking in the interest of the common man or 
not. I keep my words to a minimum.”

The Force of Data: How Universal Recording “Warps” Human Nature
Du Zhenglun, who was in charge of the Record, exhorted: “My duty is to make 
sure that everything the Emperor says must be recorded in detail. If the Emperor says 
something that violates his imperial virtue, it will be known for thousands of years. 
It is good that the Emperor considers his words.”8 
Li Shimin always wanted to take a look at the Record. He wanted to know what 
was being said about his reign. One day he issued an imperial edict, demanding to 
see it. “I have no other goal but to examine it as a way to better understand my own 
errors.” He must have thought that was the best way to sneak a peek. 
“The Emperor has made no errors,” Zhu Zishe, one of the high ofﬁcials, responded. 
“It would not be a problem for you to look at the Record. But this would set a 
precedent for future historians. The Record is based on true actions and words. 
Whether those actions and words are good or bad, they were done and said by the 
Emperor. Some rulers have only wanted their good deeds recorded. If they were 
to look at the Record and see their failures noted down, they would be displeased. 
The ofﬁcial historian would fear for his life. If you were to look, it endangers future 
generations of historians, whose job it is to record the truth.”9 
When Emperor Taizong, he had no comeback. But he couldn’t let it go. A short 
time later, he went to seek out Chu Suiliang, the minister in charge of admonition 
and arbitration. “You are in charge of the Record at present,” the Emperor said, “so 
you must know what gets written in it. Can you let me look?”. 
Even though Emperor Taizong had taken power in a brutal coup, he still had 
respect for the institution of the ofﬁcial historian. 
Unexpectedly, Chu Suiliang turned him down, too. “The man that is responsible 
for recording the Record is just the same as the two men that once sat at the left 
and right sides of the ruler, recording his actions and words. Everything has to be 
recorded—good and bad. The reason for this is that it is meant for rulers of future 
generations. It should provide lessons to future rulers on correct governance. I have 
never heard of any past rulers attempting to see the Record.” 
“If I make errors or speak inappropriately, will you record it?” Emperor Taizong 
asked. 
“Of course,” Chu Suiliang said. “It is my duty!” 
Another minister named Liu Bo was standing nearby. “Even if Chu Suiliang 
does not record your errors,” he said, “they will be recorded by the people of your 
kingdom.”10 
This was quite clever. It warned the Emperor off his attempts to burnish his image 
in the Record. He nodded his head and gave up on his quest to peek. 
Li Ang (809–840)—the personal name of Emperor Wenzong of Tang—really did 
end up seeing the Record.

5.2 The Bane of an Emperor’s Existence
115
One day, Emperor Wenzong and his high ofﬁcials were discussing political issues, 
while Zheng Lang stood nearby, making notes for the Record. After the ministers 
dispersed, Emperor Wenzong said: “Did you write down everything we just said? 
Let me have a look.” 
“What I have written is intended for the historical record,” Zheng Lang said. “As 
you know, it is forbidden by convention for the Emperor to read it. Emperor Taizong 
wanted to read the Record, too. Zhu Zishe and Chu Suiliang had to dissuade him.” 
Emperor Wenzong was not impressed with that answer. “Anyways,” he said, “the 
things we discussed today can’t be easily divided into good or bad, so what does it 
matter? Let me have a look. My only intention is to review what I said, just in case 
I let slip any remarks that I should not have. If I could have a look, I would know to 
be more careful in the future.” 
Emperor Wenzong’s remarks had their own logic. There had long been a debate 
about whether or not to reveal the Record to the ruler in charge. In most earlier 
dynasties, the rulers had been given the chance to see it. That practice had lasted 
up until the Northern and Southern dynasties, when the convention had shifted to 
the ruler not looking at the Record. From the Tang onward, the convention had been 
honored. 
In the end, Zheng Lang could not hold the Emperor back. He let him see the 
Record.11 
Not unsurprisingly, once Emperor Wenzong took a peek, he wanted to see it again. 
By that time, a new secretary was in charge of taking notes. His name was Wei Mo. 
He refused to let Emperor Wenzong peek. He advised the Emperor that if he was 
worried about how he was being remembered, that it was better to worry about doing 
good deeds. Emperor Wenzong was dissatisﬁed. “I have already looked at it once,” 
he said, “so, why not let me look again?”. 
Digression: Should the ruler be able to look at historical records or not? 
After the death of Emperor Taizu, he was succeeded by Emperor Taizong (939– 
997), who decreed that the Record should be sent to the ofﬁcial historian only 
after he had done a monthly review. Emperor Renzong (1010–1063) came 
to power, Ouyang Xiu criticized rulers that read the Record. He submitted 
a petition to the effect that the Record should remain independent. Emperor 
Renzong accepted his opinion. However, when Emperor Xiaozong took power, 
he broke with that convention. Hu Quan, a famous minister of the period wrote 
a petition requesting that he honor Renzong’s example and not look at the 
Record.12

The Force of Data: How Universal Recording “Warps” Human Nature
The idea of rulers looking at these historical notes was supported by some. 
Northern Zhou Dynasty historian Liu Qiu (501–554) claimed that making 
everything public would be instructive to the ruler, his ministers, and everyone 
in the world. He wrote a petition to the ruler of the time: “Sovereigns of 
ancient times established the position of court historian not only to record 
events, but also to offer warnings. The historians that sat at either side of 
ancient sovereigns would praise their good deeds and rebuke poor decisions. 
This was ideal. … However, since the Han and the Wei, the Record has become 
a secret document. It is only to be passed onto future generations. That makes 
it useless to sovereigns about whom it is being written. This will not lead the 
sovereign to moral virtue and help them to avoid falling into bad habits. There 
is no way to know whether what is being recorded is true or not. This will 
lead to disputes and different ways to view the same facts. … Perhaps future 
generations reading the Record will also dispute their account. Nobody will 
know what is accurate. … I advise that the Record be written down and then 
make it available to read. This is the way to make things clear. By doing this, 
everyone can understand the successes and failures of the current sovereign. 
Let well-intentioned advice and benevolent actions be cultivated and erroneous 
actions shunned.”13 
“You were given a look,” Wei Mo said, “because of a mistake on the part of the 
secretary. I will not neglect my duty. If we let you see the Record, we will not be 
able to do our jobs correctly. We might be hesitant to record your failures. Right and 
wrong would be confused. It would distort history. How could we bear to pass on 
such a Record to future generations?”14 
Emperor Taizong and Emperor Taizu were both wise rulers. They respected 
convention enough to ask permission. There were many more monarchs far less 
reasonable than them. If they didn’t like what the historian wrote, they would replace 
them. To curry favor with rulers, some historians would write elaborate odes to their 
virtues, neglecting to write a single word about any failures. 
From this, you might be able to guess that being an ofﬁcial historian was a risky 
job in ancient China. A ruler could exercise his authority to make life pleasant for 
a historian that could ensure his posthumous acclaim. But a historian that wouldn’t 
cooperate was risking the wrath of the ruler. There are many examples of historians 
cut down in their ofﬁces or their entire family lines being snuffed out. When Emperor 
Taiwu of the Northern Wei (408–452) saw the history recorded by Cui Hao, he 
believed that it exposed a plot against him, being led by the historian’s clan. He 
could not tolerate dissent. He ordered the execution of Cui Hao’s entire clan, killing 
at least 128 people.

5.2 The Bane of an Emperor’s Existence
117
Unfortunately, there were many foolish leaders in history. But even if they spent 
their reigns indulging in wanton luxury, they still hoped to leave behind a glorious 
record. If the Record they passed on was stained with misdeed, it would bring shame 
upon those that came after them. In 403 AD, Huan Xuan (369–404) usurped the throne 
of the Eastern Jin Dynasty and declared himself emperor. His rule was “arrogant and 
extravagant, distracted by hunting and leisure that seemed to go on day and night.” 
He was later driven by Liu Yu (363–422) out of Nanjing. As he ﬂed, his greatest 
concern was not staging a comeback or overcoming his difﬁculties, but what was 
recorded about him in the Record. He was dissatisﬁed with the historian’s record, so 
he began composing his own. He wrote voluminously about his wise decisions and 
superb strategy. He argued that it was only because his subordinates had failed to heed 
his commands that he had been driven from power. Once he was ﬁnished, he issued 
a “proclamation far and wide,” hoping to popularize his own account. Dictating the 
text and having it dictated back to him for editing took up most of his time. There 
was no chance to convene meetings of his generals. Within months, his troops were 
defeated and he was beheaded.15 
Good rulers fear recording, but so do lesser rulers. Knowledge, philosophy, 
and prestige come from observing, analyzing, and summarizing history. Historical 
records represent objective reality. History is perpetual and transcendent. There is 
a line drawn from traditional philosophy to the effect that the laws of nature would 
continue to obtain, whether a benevolent sage-king such as Yao reigned or whether a 
wicked tyrant like Jie reigned—and this can be applied, also, to history. In a society 
that was traditionally based on Confucianism, the conduct of a ruler was closely 
linked to their legitimacy. The ethics of virtue and morality were paramount, so 
the ruler had to do their utmost to uphold them. When it came to their speech and 
behavior being recorded, they had no solution but to perform for history. 
Recording can inspire our internal human ethics. We still have not come up with 
a good way to explain the psychological secrets behind those ethics. Kant put it this 
way: 
Two things ﬁll the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often 
and steadily we reﬂect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within 
me. 
Basically, recording has a mysterious power. In order to counter this force, Confu-
cians came up with the idea of shendu, which means to be absolutely blameless in 
your personal life. If we can hold ourselves to that, there is no need to fear having 
our words or actions recorded. Human history moves in cycles. In recent years, some 
rulers were not afraid of their deeds being recorded, but of not being recorded. 
I am referring to the age of the democratically-elected president. We have to return 
to Edison because it was him that expanded our recording methods beyond writing, 
painting, and photography.

5.3 Edison Broadens the Horizons of Recording 
In 1877, Edison was experimenting with his telegraph and made a discovery: mechan-
ical vibrations could produce a sound. He came up with the brilliant idea that mechan-
ical vibrations could be generated in a way that reproduced a sound. Edison and his 
assistants worked around the clock to develop the ﬁrst phonograph. Edison recorded 
himself reciting “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” He played it back from a mechan-
ical device. It was like an extraterrestrial transmission. People that heard it were 
dumbfounded. It was a watershed moment in a new age of voice recording. 
Edison later explained the principle and the process in an article: 
We have all been struck by the precision with which even the faintest sea-waves impress 
upon the surface of a beach the ﬁne, sinuous line which is formed by the rippling edge 
of their advance. Almost as familiar is the fact that grains of sand sprinkled on a smooth 
surface of glass or wood, one or near a piano, sift themselves into various lines and curves 
according to the vibrations of the melody played on piano-keys. […] This led me to try ﬁtting 
a diaphragm to the machine, which would receive the vibrations or sound-waves made by my 
voice when I talked to it, and register these vibrations upon an impressible material placed 
on the cylinder. 
Edison’s life gave us many monumental inventions, but the phonograph caused 
the biggest sensation (Fig. 5.1). Forty years before, there had been amazement that 
photos could reproduce events from the past, and there was amazement again when 
the phonograph became a “speaking machine.” 
There are two main ways that we absorb information: our eyes accept visual 
information and our ears accept auditory information. Writing and images provided 
a way to record visual information, and Edison’s invention provided a way to record 
auditory information. The phonograph moved us from only recording visual data to 
also recording auditory data. For the ﬁrst time in history, the phonograph gave us a 
way to record invisible, intangible, ﬂeeting sounds in a way that allowed for playback 
at a selected time. 
Now, we are in an age of AI. The core of AI technology is an ability to imitate the 
human brain’s ability to process visual and auditory data and make decisions about 
it. We want AI to be able to read the written word, make out the details in pictures, 
and be able to understand speech. Those abilities are what will allow them to become 
closer to ourselves and conﬁrm their intelligence. Having said that, it reminds us that 
Edison’s speaking machine was the ﬁrst artiﬁcial intelligence. 
Edison’s phonograph was sent all over the world, even ending up in the hands of 
Kaiser Wilhelm II (1859–1941). The Kaiser loved his phonograph to the point that 
he gave his ministers an impromptu lecture on the principles behind it: 
They listened patiently as he expounded on acoustics, sound waves, and mechanical vibra-
tions, but they were astounded when he inserted a cylinder, ﬁred up the motor, and his 
disembodied voice ﬁlled the room. The excitement was hard to contain. The lecture and 
demonstration continued for several more hours. The Kaiser explained the working details 
of the phonograph in such detail that he could have been mistaken for its inventor. Once he 
was done, he left the room, leaving his mystiﬁed ministers behind to puzzle out everything 
they had just seen and heard.16 
16 Jones (2016).

5.3 Edison Broadens the Horizons of Recording
119
Fig. 5.1 Edison shows a tinfoil phonograph in 187817 
Reading the history of the phonograph, I was amazed by the reception of tech-
nological innovations among the European aristocracy of the time. Emperor Kangxi 
of the Qing had a fondness for clocks and watches, but the spirit of science did not 
take root in his dynasty. Technology and new inventions were seen as being on the 
same level as magic tricks. 
The ﬁrst Chinese person to encounter the phonograph was Guo Songtao (1818– 
1891), Ambassador to the United Kingdom. In May 1878, he was at a social event 
where Edison was demonstrating his invention. Guo Songtao described it in his 
diary as “heavenly technological masterpiece.” The phonograph was introduced into 
China through Tibet in 1897. Merchants there knew that there was a need for repetitive 
prayer recitals. Recording prayers would be a good money making opportunity. They 
went and recorded a lama reciting a Sanskrit mantra, “Om mani padme hum.” The 
recording was played back on a loop. The lamas were stunned. 
The phonograph surprised crowds in London, too. One day, a large crowd gathered 
around a hawker’s cart. Under normal circumstances, a hawker’s cries wouldn’t cause 
much of a stir—but on that day, they were coming from a phonograph. As the scene 
unfolded, the hawker himself stayed mostly silent, taking cash and handing goods

to the customers. It turned out that the hawker had come down with the ﬂu and lost 
his voice. When Edison heard this story, he burst out laughing. 
Digression: the difference between the tape recorder and the phonograph 
Edison’s invention was called the phonograph; in April of 1878, he founded the 
Edison Speaking Phonograph Company. The playback ability of the phono-
graph was crucial. As sound vibrated a piece of metal, a stylus carved grooves 
into a piece of tin foil. When a stylus was run back over the grooves, it repro-
duced the sound. This invention laid the foundation for the tape recorder. 
Different designs for the tape recorder were invented successively in Germany 
and then the United States in 1938. The principle they worked on was the 
same: a magnetizable medium was run past a recording head. This became the 
twentieth century’s most popular recording system. 
Shortly after inventing the phonograph, Edison predicted that it’s primary utility 
would be in the ofﬁce. His idea was that the phonograph would be used to record 
conversations and phone calls for clerks to transcribe. It could also be used in the 
courtroom, replacing the stenographer in recording remarks by the judge, lawyers, 
and witnesses. He also guessed that it would be used to record music. 
Edison was correct. The later development of recording technology proved his 
foresight. In 1940, the White House received a tape recorder and President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt ordered it installed in the Oval Ofﬁce. Edison predicted a bright future 
for his invention, but nobody at that moment could have predicted that it would 
change the course of American political history. 
5.4 Nixon’s Dilemma: A Brief History of White House 
Sound Recording 
The 32nd President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt wanted to introduce 
recording equipment into the White House because of a strained relationship with 
the press. 
Roosevelt often complained about reporters taking his remarks out of context or 
blatantly misquoting him. He had spent a lot of time ﬁghting wars of words with the 
media. In February 1939, he called a press conference to criticize reports: 
I have in front of me, oh, about eight or ten different newspapers. There isn’t one story 
or one headline in all of those papers that does not give, to put it politely, an erroneous 
impression-not one. It is a rather interesting fact. These things have been manufactured by 
deliberate misrepresentation of facts, existing facts.18 
18 Bennetts (1982).

5.4 Nixon’s Dilemma: A Brief History of White House Sound Recording
121
When Roosevelt was seeking a third term in 1940, with the Second World War 
raging. At that time, the American public was isolationist and Roosevelt’s pro-
intervention remarks often caused an uproar. Wendell Willkie, Roosevelt’s Repub-
lican challenger attacked him for this, charging that Roosevelt was going to send 
American sons, brothers, and loved ones to their graves. Roosevelt had to be very 
careful with how he spoke on foreign policy and wartime strategy. He once said at 
a press conference that he did not want war with either Hitler or Mussolini.19 When 
this statement was reported in the papers, it was taken as a lack of stamina for combat. 
For Roosevelt, explaining himself to the press took up more effort than it was worth. 
For this reason, Roosevelt liked to bypass the newspaper and radio reporters and 
go directly to the public through his ﬁreside chats. He also befriended NBC’s David 
Sarnoff, who understood Roosevelt’s difﬁculties with the press, and was the one that 
gifted the White House a tape recorder. Roosevelt had it installed under a lamp on a 
desk in the Oval Ofﬁce. Whenever he had to talk to the press, his stenographer would 
ﬂip the switch on the tape recorder. 
Roosevelt warned reporters not to misquote him, since he had the recordings as 
backup. Altogether, there survive fourteen recordings of press conferences, but for 
reasons that remain unclear, there were recordings made of several private conver-
sations. In these unguarded moments, we can hear Roosevelt talking rather coarsely 
about Willkie’s rumored extramarital affairs. 
Following Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson all used tape 
recorders in the White House. Kennedy was particularly enthusiastic about recording 
conversations in the Oval Ofﬁce, especially after the media roasted him over the 
disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion.20 By the time Johnson replaced Kennedy, recording 
technology had progressed to the point that it could easily be installed in more White 
House ofﬁces, as well as patched into phone lines, allowing every meeting and call 
to be recorded. 
At that time, the White House recording system was top secret and its existence 
was known to very few. 1973 and Richard Nixon would change all that. Watergate 
shocked the world and wrecked Nixon’s second term—and it also made public the 
White House recording system. 
Nixon entered the White House on January 20th, 1969. After the inauguration 
ceremony, he and Chief of Staff HR Haldeman (1926–1993) went into the Oval 
Ofﬁce and opened the pantry over the ﬁreplace, which Johnson had told them about. 
That was where the recording equipment was concealed. Inside the pantry was a 
control panel, connected with wires to other ofﬁces in the building. The two political 
veterans were shocked. They guessed correctly and were a bit frightened by the idea 
that Johnson must have recorded many of the conversations held at the White House. 
As president-elect, Nixon had been informed that there was a recording system, 
but he had no idea of the extent of its use. Johnson had once complained to him
19 More speciﬁcally, he said: “We don’t want any war with you. … We don’t consider ourselves 
belligerent.” 
20 This refers to a failed April, 1961 invasion of Cuba by Cuban refugees assisted by the CIA. The 
operation was a failure. 

122

The Force of Data: How Universal Recording “Warps” Human Nature
that everyone that left his ofﬁce had their own ideas about what he was thinking or 
plotting. For their own beneﬁt, Johnson said, people would distort what he had said. 
The recordings were his way to keep the facts straight. 
This had been a problem for previous presidents, too. Eisenhower had admitted in 
1954 that he recorded, saying that it was the best way to protect himself from people 
in Washington that he didn’t trust.21 
Two people have a conversation and, afterwards, one of them attributes something 
he said himself to the other person. There’s a slang term for that: “ﬂipping the 
pancake.” 
English philosopher Francis Bacon once wrote an essay on “ﬂipping the pancake.” 
He tells the story of two friends that are vying for a ministerial appointment. One 
says that he would rather not be a minister, since the monarchy is in decline. The 
second man agreed. Later, when the ﬁrst man reported the conversation to others, he 
told them that his friend was uninterested in becoming a minister. When the Queen 
heard the remarks, the ﬁrst man received the ministerial appointment and his friend 
fell out of favor. He “ﬂipped the pancake” on his friend, baiting him into agreeing 
with him but then only reporting one side of the conversation. 
There are many examples throughout history of this trick being played. The reason 
is simple: nobody had the ability to record conversations. 
Nixon understood this. He had served as vice president for two terms before taking 
the Oval Ofﬁce. But he wasn’t fond of secret recordings. He thought experience and 
diplomacy would carry him through any complicated situations. The very day he and 
Haldeman discovered the system, he ordered it removed. 
Nixon quickly encountered difﬁculties. 
First, there was no satisfying way to take minutes in a meeting. Nixon’s staff had 
arranged for a stenographer but there were too many meetings for them to keep up. 
It became inconvenient for many people to talk at once. Nixon was not pleased with 
the situation. Apart from the inconvenience of the stenographer, he found that the 
written word could not catch certain unspoken but important pieces of information, 
like a subtle change in a speaker’s tone, for example. Haldeman made a suggestion 
to use different color codes to mark tone or emphasis, but this was somewhat limited. 
What Nixon noticed about his notes shows some of the limitations of using the 
written word to record. It’s a system of one-dimensional symbols, unable to capture 
all the complexities of reality. A person’s tone, expression, gestures, and other body 
language all add to what a speaker is saying, but a transcript has no way to record 
this speciﬁc information and how it transpires in time and space. 
Second, it was hard to attend to diplomatic requirements. Nixon played the diplo-
macy card during his ﬁrst term, so he was often in meetings with foreign dignitaries. 
In order to build mutual trust and warmth, he would often rely on his guest’s inter-
preter, instead of bringing in one of his own. During the talks with China in 1972, 
Nixon relied completely on interpreters from the Chinese side. There are obvious 
disadvantages to this practice, however. A small mistake in the interpretation can
21 Ting (2001). 

5.4 Nixon’s Dilemma: A Brief History of White House Sound Recording
123
lead to immense confusion, which can affect policy decisions. Nixon needed record-
ings of his meetings so that an interpreter from the White House National Security 
Council could review the tapes, checking for inconsistencies. 
The ﬁnal reason for the recording was more selﬁsh. After American leaders leave 
ofﬁce, they go back to being private citizens. They step back into the shadows. Most 
presidents compose memoirs as a way to pay the bills. With all the recordings, Nixon 
knew that his book could be as accurate and complete as possible. 
At the beginning of 1971, Nixon reversed his earlier decision and had recording 
equipment reinstalled in the White House. He made one request of Haldeman: he 
wanted a single switch to toggle the system on or off, so that he could always have 
it ready. “Mr. President,” Haldeman said, “I can promise you that you’ll forget to 
hit that button. By the time you realize it, it’ll be too late. I know what’s going to 
happen.” 
Haldeman identiﬁed a common dilemma that many of us have faced: we ﬁnd 
ourselves unprepared in situations we should be prepared for. He had a solution, 
however. Technology had improved since the Johnson administration. It was possible 
to have the system be sound-activated. As soon as someone entered the ofﬁce or 
ﬂicked on the light, the tapes would start rolling. 
Nixon approved this high-tech solution. He never expected that this decision 
would one day lead him into an abyss. 
The recording system began operating on February 16th, 1971. The system was 
restricted at ﬁrst to the Oval Ofﬁce and the Cabinet Ofﬁce, but Nixon had his deputy 
assistant Alexander Butterﬁeld expand it out to other ofﬁces, meeting rooms, and 
even living areas. In May of 1972, Camp David was outﬁtted with its own system. 
Just as Haldeman had promised, as soon as anyone entered a room, the mics would 
be hot and the tapes rolling. 
Of course, the existence of this system was highly classiﬁed. Nixon had repeatedly 
stressed that the tapes were for his personal use only. Apart from the technicians that 
installed the system, only Nixon and the three men closest to him were aware of 
its existence. The entire Cabinet, including Secretary of State Henry Kissinger were 
completely unaware that they were being bugged by the President. 
After installing the system, Haldeman had it tested several times by technicians 
to make sure it was working normally. It was quickly forgotten as the White House 
began normal operations. Nobody had time to pay attention. “[T]he worry quickly 
passed,” Haldeman recalled, “as did any awareness at all that Nixon’s conversations— 
my conversations, often—were being taped. I think Nixon lost his awareness of the 
system even more quickly than I did.” He only occasionally considered that he was 
being recorded: “I sometimes ask myself if I would have said some things differently 
if I had consciously considered the fact that my words were being taped.”22 
Of course he did. “But my conﬁdence,” Haldeman said, “that the tapes were never 
going to be heard by anyone except Nixon and myself was so great that I really do 
suspect I would have pushed any incipient worry about disclosure aside and spoken 
just as I did.”
22 Haldeman (1988).

The Force of Data: How Universal Recording “Warps” Human Nature
Although the system was ﬁlling up tapes, Haldeman recalls Nixon rarely listening 
to them. The only signiﬁcant incident was near the beginning of 1972, when Henry 
Kissinger took an interview with an Italian journalist and seemed to be trying to 
distance himself from Nixon’s Vietnam policy. Nixon was furious and told Haldeman 
to warn Kissinger that all of his conversations were being recorded and to stay on 
message. 
Haldeman, however, didn’t follow this command. He secretly modiﬁed the order: 
“I am virtually certain I never gave Kissinger this message. I chose to consider what 
Nixon said to me more as a ﬂare of anger than as considered instruction, and I probably 
told Kissinger simply to be more careful about what he said during interviews.” 
Did this kind of large-scale monitoring program have its risks? Nixon himself 
was not so sure it should continue. On April 9th, 1973, he ordered Haldeman to 
dismantle the system. By the afternoon, he had changed his mind. Nixon wanted 
the system maintained but an on–off switch installed. Haldeman was distracted and 
neglected the order. The sound-activated switch remained in place. The tapes were 
always ready to roll. 
When the Senate Watergate Committee began looking into the scandal, Butterﬁeld 
was hauled in to testify. On July 16th, 1973, he was asked if any listening devices 
had been installed in the White House; he was forced to answer in the afﬁrmative, 
explaining that all conversations in the White House had been recorded. This was a 
bombshell. It seemed to be proof that the White House held the key to breaking open 
the investigation. The Senate Committee immediately subpoenaed the tapes. 
Two days later, the tapes ﬁnally stopped rolling at the White House. 
In fact, even before Watergate had become a scandal that publicly implicated 
himself, Nixon had started to be uneasy about the recordings. In April of 1973, he 
had ordered Haldeman to compile all recordings of a March 21st, 1973 conversation 
with White House aide John Dean about Watergate. “He wanted to know precisely 
what he had said during that troubling conversation,” Haldeman recalled. 
Nixon had refused to give up the tapes to the Senate on the grounds of executive 
privilege. The matter went to the Supreme Court, who, after three weeks of delibera-
tion, ruled unanimously (one Justice recused himself due to connections to the Nixon 
administration) that Nixon was bound by the law to release the tapes to investigators. 
Under immense pressure from the Supreme Court and political rivals, Nixon 
relented and handed over the tapes. 
Compared to the eight hours of recordings left behind by Roosevelt, the 4,000 h 
Nixon tapes represent an immense amount of data. When these recordings were 
ﬁnally transcribed, they ran to 27,000 pages. 12.5 h of recordings were singled out 
as key evidence in the Watergate investigation. These recordings included the so-
called “smoking gun” tape, which covers the period six days after the arrest of the 
operative that broke into the Democratic Party ofﬁces in the Watergate Hotel to install 
a wiretap, during which Nixon began planning a coverup. 
The ﬁnal result was that Nixon was forced to resign, becoming the ﬁrst American 
president to step down over impeachment. Everyone else involved in Watergate 
received varying degrees of punishment. In fact, the tapes that Nixon had submitted 
to the Supreme Court were incomplete. There was a gap in the recording that lasted

18.5 min, supposedly the result of an error by Nixon’s secretary. The contents of the 
gap remain a mystery to this day, with some suggesting that it contains Nixon and 
Haldeman talking about speciﬁc arrangements for the wiretapping of the Democratic 
Party ofﬁces. If that was true, it would have been enough to send Nixon to prison. 
Nixon denied these allegations, of course. Following his resignation, he spent his 
remaining years trying to restore his tattered reputation. In memoirs he published in 
1990, he described his original intentions for his recording system. 
From the beginning, he intended for his administration to be “the best chronicled 
in history.” He “wanted a record of every major meeting” that would range “from 
verbatim transcripts of important national security sessions to ‘color reports’ of 
ceremonial events.”23 
5.5 Trump’s Recording Troubles 
In the intervening decades, the White House recording system faded in memory— 
until one day in May of 2017, when it hit the headlines again. Nixon was replaced 
as the protagonist in this story by the 45th President, Donald J. Trump. 
As soon as Trump was elected, “Russiagate” ﬂared up again. This was centered 
on a suspicion that Russia had been involved in or inﬂuenced the American general 
election. Figuring out what precisely happened became a matter of Congressional 
and FBI investigation. Shortly after taking ofﬁce, Trump had invited FBI director 
James Comey for lunch. On May 9th, 2017, Trump abruptly relieved Comey of his 
duties, far ahead of the end of his tenure. 
Soon afterward, Comey went to the New York Times to reveal what had been 
discussed at lunch that day. Trump, Comey said, had asked him about the progress 
in the Russiagate investigation and requested his loyalty. He also asked for leniency 
for former White House aide Michael Flynn. As Comey told it, he had expressed to 
Trump that he would justify the law impartially; in the end, the promise to uphold 
the law had caused Trump to relieve him of his duties and seek a replacement. Trump 
promptly denied all of Comey’s one-sided claims. The same issue arises again: if 
two people are giving their account of a private conversation, neither is reliable. 
Three days later, Trump took to Twitter to attack Comey, posting a warning that 
he might have a recording of the conversation. The implications were clear: if there 
was a tape of the lunch chat, Comey had best watch what he says. 
This touched off a heated discussion in the media and in public opinion. Forty 
years after Nixon, a president was hinting at a system to record conversations. 
After Watergate made public the White House recording system, there had been a 
debate in the United States over who had the right to record in the president’s ofﬁce 
and who should own the recordings. In 1978, Congress introduced the Presiden-
tial Records Act to govern the president’s ofﬁcial records. It had three key points: 
public ownership of presidential records, a statutory structure for presidents and
23 Nixon (1990). 

126

The Force of Data: How Universal Recording “Warps” Human Nature
vice-presidents to supervise and manage their records, and rules must be followed 
about differentiating ofﬁcial and private recordings. 
Nixon’s disastrous experience had been enough to put future presidents off 
recording in their White House. That changed with the 40th president, Ronald 
Reagan. He used it occasionally in the belief that recordings could conﬁrm the 
accuracy of memory. He went beyond simple audio recordings to capturing video 
of meetings with foreign guests. Reagan was accustomed to being in front of the 
camera, having been a Hollywood star before entering politics. When Reagan biog-
rapher Craig Shirley was asked whether the former president would have ever used 
the tapes improperly, he said, “Threaten or attempt to blackmail a former government 
ofﬁcial? The question itself is preposterous because it never would have even crossed 
Reagan’s mind.”24 
Trump’s Twitter post to Comey about recordings was clearly a threat. There are 
many examples throughout history of people attempting to use records in their posses-
sion to bully opponents. It’s possible that Chinese history has the ﬁnest examples 
of this practice. Ren Bo’an held a position in the Qing bureaucracy akin to today’s 
ofﬁce clerks, ﬁlling his time drafting basic ofﬁcial documents. He used his position to 
begin noting down failures, secrets, and improprieties of various types. The records 
he collected became a powerful blackmail tool. Nobody had the nerve to turn down 
anyone wielding those records. The nobles of the Yongzheng did everything they 
could to recover them. It became a political scandal. 
Trump’s threat worked and Comey went quiet. But that wasn’t the end of his trou-
bles. Given his lack of political experience, it’s likely that Trump didn’t understand 
the Presidential Records Act. Within days of making the threat, the Senate ordered 
Trump to hand over any recordings he had made of himself and Comey. In accor-
dance with the 1978 law, any recordings made by Trump belonged to the state. That 
would mean that anything he recorded would be reviewed and then archived, with 
the possible option of making it public. 
On June 22nd, Trump ﬁred off two more social media missives, denying that he 
had any recordings. He said, essentially, that he was aware of conversations about 
withholding electronic surveillance, but, if any recordings existed, he had not made 
them and didn’t possess them. 
Trump was exploiting a loophole in the 1978 Act. According to the law, any 
recordings made by the White House belong to the state, but that does not prohibit 
the President from making recordings as a private citizen. With the development of 
technology, recording equipment does not require a system like Nixon installed in 
the White House. A high quality miniature recorder could ﬁt in your pocket and 
be triggered at any time. It could also be done with a phone. The 1978 law didn’t 
speciﬁcally ban any of this, so it became something of a legal gray area. 
The American press speculated that Presidents must have used recording equip-
ment in the past. Even though Obama never made use of the White House system, he 
was still making tapes. When Mark Bowden was interviewing Obama for a book on 
the killing of Osama bin Laden, he suddenly panicked when he realized his miniature

5.6 The Inefﬁciencies of Live Broadcast

recorder was not working, but once the interview was over, the Obama team passed 
him a complete transcript. That was proof that Obama was making recordings of 
interviews and meetings. 
Trump’s situation was not that different from that faced by Roosevelt. He didn’t 
trust the news media and publicly criticized them for distorting facts. His accusation 
of “fake news” turned the phrase into a buzz word in the United States. While 
Roosevelt had taken to the radio to get his message out without distortion, Trump 
went to Twitter. During his ﬁrst year in ofﬁce, he made an average of six to seven 
posts on Twitter everyday. Perhaps this “Twitter governance” will one day be studied 
by future generations. 
Whether broadcast on the radio or posted to Twitter, the information is recorded. 
Over the past century, our capacity and ability to record has continuously expanded, 
starting with text, then images, then sound, and video. In a political environment 
always in ﬂux, the written word is too vague and images have their own limitations. 
The accuracy of audio records is much greater, and they have the beneﬁt of being 
able to be produced much more discreetly. Holding on to records is ostensibly an aid 
for memory and to improve accuracy, but it also means possessing secrets, truths, 
and evidence. What Roosevelt set in motion in the White House has not yet reached 
its conclusion. 
5.6 The Inefﬁciencies of Live Broadcast 
As we’ve already seen, when Reagan entered the White House in 1981, he began 
using video in addition to audio. Video technology was becoming more advanced 
and popular. In 1979, the American government announced that it would begin live 
broadcasts of sessions of Congress and committee debates. 
The Constitution stipulated that all votes in each House should be recorded. When 
the United States Congress was ﬁrst convened in 1789, a staff was established to 
record meetings and debates of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Orders 
were made to disclose all of these records to the public. At that time, there was 
no Internet, or even television, so the information was mostly dispersed through 
newspapers. 
Beginning in 1841, Congress had a press box, but, like Roosevelt and Trump, they 
still had problems. They accused reporters of changing quotes, misleading readers, 
or even creating “fake news.” There were numerous disputes that led to reporters 
occasionally being expelled. As the two sides battled, it was the public that suffered 
from lack of information. 
Kennedy’s presidency saw the rise of television. In 1979, Cable-Satellite Public 
Affairs Network (C-SPAN) was established to live broadcast Congress. C-SPAN had 
an outsized inﬂuence in the political culture of the United States. Brian Lamb (1941-) 
, C-SPAN’s founder said that TV could reveal the entire political process and give 
citizens the feeling of being present for deliberations. With a complete broadcast 
record of goings-on, there were far fewer disputes between members and the press.

The Force of Data: How Universal Recording “Warps” Human Nature
In April of 2012, Congress announced that they would live stream coverage at 
HouseLive.gov and make archival recordings available. Meetings often last late into 
the evening and can run more than ten hours. But all of it was available online, from 
the opening prayer, to the speeches by members, to the debate over votes, to voting, to 
counting the votes, and even the adjournment process. Every word and action would 
be broadcast and recorded. That was expanded from regular House meetings to less 
formal events with individual Congressmen and their staff. Along with the video, the 
website also hosts additional material about the meetings. Users can quickly search 
for clips or documents with keywords. 
This is a comprehensive and continuous recording. Compared to The Record of the 
Emperor’s Daily Activities, it is very impressive. Legislators know that every word 
they say, every gesture, and all their body language will be broadcast and archived 
for countless viewers at present and in the future. The politicians are aware that the 
voters will make a judgment on them. TV became a key place for politicians to put on 
a show and attempt to draw votes. A survey by the House showed that live broadcast 
of meetings had increased the number and length of speeches. Some members will 
even intentionally court controversy, since they know it will be recorded and make 
news. Since the time Congress passed their bill to broadcast all meetings, average 
speech time has increased by 54% and daily session time has increased by 6%.25 
The paradox is that although recordings are meant to ensure truthfulness and 
accuracy, it can also distort human behavior. 
In 2002, the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed the 
idea of political civilization, but there have been few discussions over the past ﬁfteen 
years of how to actually build it. We have already talked about the signiﬁcance of 
records to what we could call Commercial Civilization and the same should be applied 
to politics. Accurate records of political goings-on could be a concrete measure 
to build political civilization. The United States has recorded every meeting of its 
Congress, meaning that two centuries of political debate have become an invaluable 
resource in political big data. We need to keep in mind that there is nothing new under 
the sun: for any problem, a solution has already been undertaken or proposed, so the 
idea of being able to search through centuries of political debate is very valuable. 
This immediate access to records is incredibly convenient to future generations trying 
to analyze and solve political impasses. Civilization comes from accumulation. We 
should stand on the shoulders of previous generations. These previous generations 
include all of humankind. Regarding the American Congressional records, there’s no 
reason they shouldn’t be translated into Chinese and referred to for our own political 
decision making.

Congress” (1982). The Academy of Political Science. 

5.7 Universal Recording: God’s Ultimate Weapon

5.7 Universal Recording: God’s Ultimate Weapon 
This section attempts to make a bold and hopefully interesting assertion. 
It begins with a novel: Adam Bede by George Eliot (the pen name of Mary Ann 
Evans, 1819–1880). In the nineteenth century, she was just as famous as Charles 
Dickens or the Brontë sisters. Adam Bede tells us an emotionally tortuous love story. 
The story takes place in the nineteenth century and starts with the heroine, Hetty, a 
beautiful country girl, being courted by the titular Adam, a local carpenter. Although 
she admits he would make a great husband, she allows herself to be seduced by 
the young squire Arthur Donnithorne. Adam and Arthur were originally friends, but 
when the former comes across the latter attempting a tryst with Hetty, they end up 
ﬁghting a duel. 
Arthur feels ashamed and ends up breaking up with Hetty in a letter, after which 
he leaves town to join a militia. Out of desperation, Hetty agrees to marry Adam, 
but then quickly realizes that she is pregnant. She runs off to ﬁnd Arthur but ends 
up giving birth before ﬁnding him. After deliberating for a while, she abandons the 
infant. 
Hetty is arrested and tried for the crime but refuses to plead guilty. 
I don’t necessarily want to talk about the love story but how Eliot constructs the 
narrative to show Hetty being awakened to her crimes and ﬁnally confessing and 
repenting. 
Before she is set to be hanged, Hetty speaks with Dinah, her cousin: 
“But, Hetty, there is some one else in this cell besides me, some one close to you.” Hetty 
said, in a frightened whisper, “Who?” 
“Some one who has been with you through all your hours of sin and trouble—who has known 
every thought you have had—has seen where you went, where you lay down and rose up 
again, and all the deeds you have tried to hide in darkness. And on Monday, when I can’t 
follow you,—when my arms can’t reach you,—when death has parted us,—he who is with 
us now, and who knows all, will be with you then. It makes no difference—whether we live 
or die, we are in the presence of God.” 
Of course, she’s talking about the Christian God. More than anything said by the 
judge or lawyer, this causes Hetty to waver: 
Hetty obeyed Dinah’s movement, and sank on her knees. They still held each other’s hands, 
and there was long silence. Then Dinah said—“. 
Hetty, we are before God: he is waiting for you to tell the truth.” 
Dinah prays with her: 
Fear and trembling have taken ahold on her; but she trembles only at the pain and death of 
the body: breathe upon her thy life giving Spirit, and put a new fear within her—the fear 
of her sin. Make her dread to keep the accursed thing within her soul: make her feel the 
presence of the living God, who beholds all the past, to whom the darkness is as noonday; 
who is waiting now, at the eleventh hour, for her to turn to him, and confess her sin, and cry 
for mercy—now, before the night of death comes, and the moment of pardon is for ever ﬂed, 
like yesterday that returneth not.

After a long time, Hetty cries out and embraces Dinah. She says that is willing to 
confess everything: 
“Dinah,” Hetty sobbed out, throwing her arms round Dinah’s neck, “I will speak... I will 
tell... I won’t hide it anymore. ... I did do it, Dinah... I buried it in the wood... the little baby... 
and it cried... I heard it cry... ever such a way off... all night... and I went back because it 
cried.” 
She paused, and then spoke hurriedly in a louder, pleading tone. 
“But I thought perhaps it wouldn’t die—there might somebody ﬁnd it. I didn’t kill it—I 
didn’t kill it myself. I put it down there and covered it up, and when I came back it was 
gone.” 
What caused Hetty to confess was not the law or her conscience but the eyes of 
God. Dinah’s description of Him as omniscient and ever-present made Hetty afraid. 
The idea that he knew everything that she said and did made her confess. 
The dialogue that Eliot writes between them and the structure of the plot reﬂects 
the culture and customs of her own society. It shows us the most fundamental under-
standing of religion, which is that words and deeds are always being recorded in 
Heaven. God or his messengers see every sin and then record it with complete accu-
racy in a dossier. Nobody can hide from or deny their crimes. They can’t deceive 
god. Facing an omnipotent and omniscient God, Hetty knew she had to admit the 
facts. Western religions tend to take this idea of an ever-present God to the extreme. 
There are many examples from the Bible: 
The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven 
upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars; whilst their children remember 
their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills (Jeremiah 17:1–2). 
Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book! That they were 
graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! (Job 19:23–24). 
Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and the Lord hearkened, and heard 
it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and 
that thought upon his name (Malachi 3:16). 
Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, 
because your names are written in heaven (Luke 10:20). 
Christianity talks about original sin, repentance, and judgment by the Lord at the 
end of days; Chinese Buddhism talks about karma and six great divisions in the 
wheel of karma. The Buddhist sutras say that fate will catch up with everyone in the 
end. In other words, good is repaid with good and evil is repaid with evil. 
Karma is still administered by a heavenly record, though. I would like to excerpt 
part of a sermon that explains this: 
The Buddha sees us very clearly. We can’t see him, but he sees us—why is that? He is always 
with us. He perceives the world but is not confused by it. We are confused by perceiving 
the world. He sees us. We can’t see him. He knows our every movement. He is so great that 
he not only knows our movements but knows them better than us. The Bodhisattvas are the 
same, as are all spiritual beings. When the King of Hell looks you up in his Book of Life 
and Death, he will see if you have done more good than evil, and then divide those good 
deeds according to the three categories; if you have done more evil than good, those evil 
deeds will be divided according to three categories, and you will be reborn into this world.

5.7 Universal Recording: God’s Ultimate Weapon
131
Nothing can be falsiﬁed. Can we come to our senses, repent, and change our ways? Yes, we 
can return from evil to good. We can slowly begin to outweigh or eliminate the bad recorded 
in the King of Hell’s book with good deeds. Our goodness will slowly grow and increase, 
but we are still unable to escape the six great divisions in the wheel of karma.26 
This is essentially the same idea as Eliot was expressing in Adam Bede. The  
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are watching us attentively and recording our word and 
deeds, so we had better be good. This is also the logic of Christianity. 
In human history, the power of religion to enlighten and guide people was obvious. 
In religious doctrine, the power of a record is a deterrent force applied to everyone. 
God is watching everyone. What we do in this life will be recorded to determine our 
treatment in the next. If you do bad, God will punish you; if you do good deeds, the 
Buddha will smile on you. In other words, in order to deter adherents from bad and 
put them on the right path, Christianity and Buddhism both arrived at the concept of 
spiritual beings that record the thoughts, words, and deeds of all sentient beings. 
The power of religion rests in the ability to record. That is the core mechanism of 
religious systems: recording things and meting out punishment or reward. 
In Chinese folk beliefs, this is made even more concrete in the idea of the Book 
of Life and Death. Everyone has heard of the King of Hell, who is usually depicted 
with the book in his right hand. Legend has it that he has records going back 99 
generations. The book is a record and the King of Hell makes judgements about the 
afterlife or reincarnation based on it. 
The metaphorical Book of Life and Death is embedded in Chinese culture. In the 
ﬁrst scene of the modern Beijing opera Guerillas on the Plains, the military hero of 
the story proclaims to some ﬁghters from the puppet regime: 
I’m telling you, the ﬁghters and volunteers in the War to Resist Japan hold the Book of Life 
and Death in their hands. If you do not aid the cause, you can earn a black mark beside your 
name. If you stay on the road of righteousness and do good deeds, in addition to the medals 
you earn, you will have a red mark beside your name. 
One of the soldiers he’s addressing immediately calls back, “We want red marks!”. 
This analogy of black and red marks clearly outlines the form and structure of the 
Book of Life and Death as a record. 
Going back to the beginning of this chapter, the ancients invented the The Record 
of the Emperor’s Daily Activities and history books as a way to use the power of 
records to restrict the power of the monarch and the elite. In 709, after reading 
a history by Zhu Jingze, Tang minister Wei Anshi sighed and said: “Most people 
don’t realize that the historians have more power than I ever will. I can only control 
the living; historians control the living and the dead. That is why some ancient 
emperors were so afraid of their historians.”27 This is proof that even at the earliest 
appearance of recorded data, its power was not overlooked. This insight led to the 
religious record idea being widely propagated. In modern times, we have still and

a speech delivered to the Hong Kong Buddhist Education Foundation.

that included Ouyang Xiu and Song Qi.

The Force of Data: How Universal Recording “Warps” Human Nature
video cameras, tape recorders, mobile phones, and advanced text records. Compared 
to the historical records of imperial China, our data is not only accurate but also 
structured, machine-readable, easily transmissible, and highly durable. Recording 
technology once possessed by a minority is now available to everyone. People don’t 
only point these devices at each other, but use their technology to record the heavens, 
the earth, and everything in between. 
As I said in a previous chapter, the basic scientiﬁc method starts with recording 
and measuring. Measuring is quantifying what has been recorded. The results of 
recording and measuring are data. Whether we are talking about an astronomer 
looking at a star or a social scientist looking at a person, the key to recording is 
establishing a trajectory—the path an object or person takes in time and space. But 
when it comes to people, they will not only chart a course through time and space 
but say and do different things along the way; they will have different moods, or 
different body language. To study a person, a complete record must be made. 
Today, we are reaching a comprehensive record. Emperor Taizu of Song and 
Emperor Taizong of Tang should count their blessings: they didn’t have to face 
modern technology but could attempt to directly inﬂuence the historians. All of 
their words and actions might now be recorded from multiple angles, with multiple 
devices and methods. These recordings could all corroborate or reinforce each other, 
meaning that no single person or institution had a monopoly on the truth. 
The human lifespan can be a century. If we trained a camera on a person to record 
their daily life, there would be about 4 gigabytes (GB) of data generated per day, 
which adds up to about 143 terabytes (TB) over a hundred years. Going by present 
day prices, it would cost about 50,000 yuan to store those 143 TB; if the data was 
compressed correctly, the price could be reduced to about 20,000 yuan. That’s how 
much it would cost to record a person’s entire life. 
The day is fast approaching that this will be a reality. As more people strap 
cameras to their heads and point their cameras at their faces, the age of complete 
lifetime recordings will come about sooner than we expected. Can we compare this 
power of complete, uninterrupted recording to that of God? 
I contend we can, but our ability to maintain universal recording will one day 
surpass even God. There is only one God, but the recording tentacles that penetrate 
into our daily lives are innumerable. God does not have the capacity to track the lives 
of billions, but universal, round-the-clock recording technology will have no such 
limitations. 
God will no longer be a ﬁction but a reality. Universal recording is a lens on 
human nature. Under this lens, human behavior will be gradually exorcized of its 
demons. We will more clearly see the good and evil, the trivial complaints, and the 
difﬁculties in human existence. The power of data will allow new social formations; 
lifestyles will be revolutionized; morality will still matter, but there will be no great 
sages or teachers. Heroic ﬁgures will still excite humanity, but ordinary life will 
be transformed by other forces. Beliefs that have held through centuries will be 
rewritten. A new society and a new age will emerge based on the foundation of equal 
rights. We are in the process of creating this new world. We are entering this new age. 
Of course, if this universal recording technology is centrally controlled, we might be 
confronted with the opposite of a society based on equal rights: totalitarianism.

Abstract There is a “golden thread” running through Commercial Civilization— 
the same as human civilization, or China. This chapter investigates statistics and 
recording by looking at the history of the printing press, examining the profound 
theories contained within A Dream of Red Mansions, and consider the develop-
ment of Chinese porcelain… From history to present, from West to East, these case 
studies are intended to give us personal, commercial, and national strategies for the 
development of a great Data Civilization. 
6.1 
Data is the Soil to Grow a New World. If We Hope 
to Use It, We Must Protect It 
On the same day, at various places, including the United States and China, twelve 
extraterrestrial spacecraft descend on the world. This causes a global panic. The 
aliens are sending messages but humans cannot decode them. War is on the horizon. 
This is the plot of 2017 sci-ﬁ blockbuster Arrival. When they realize they are not 
the only sentient race in the universe, humanity experiences a cosmic social phobia. 
Arrival envisions how we might receive a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization. 
This ﬁlm inspired me to re-examine the most basic origins and developments of 
human civilization. 
In the ﬁlm, Louise Banks, a linguist played by Amy Adams, and physicist Ian 
Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are dispatched by the American military to communicate 
with the aliens. The physicist quotes from the book she wrote: “Language is the ﬁrst 
weapon drawn in a conﬂict.” He disagrees with her conclusion, saying that the ﬁrst 
weapon is science. 
As the narrative unfolds, neither language nor science offer a solution. 
Although the aliens and humanity attempt to communicate with each other, they 
constantly fail. There is confusion that eventually leads to panic. At the key moment 
when the conﬂict could be escalated, Louis Banks ﬁnally understands that the answer 
lies in the written language of the aliens. She realizes she has to study the form, color, 
and meaning of the symbols. She begins to decipher these ring-shaped symbols and 
understand the messages that the aliens hoped to deliver (Fig. 6.1).

Why was the solution found in the written word? 
People can use their voices to express themselves, pass on information, and 
communicate, but the meaning can be hard to decipher. This is what Louise Banks 
realizes in the movie. When the aliens wanted to get their message across, they had 
to write it down. At that point, humans could record and decipher them. The written 
word is different from the voice or the language: they can not only express thoughts, 
pass on information, and allow communication, but they can be easily recorded. The 
written word allows a message to be preserved for study and analysis.

Recording as a New Perspective on Development 
Our ancient ancestors had the urge to write and paint. They did it in the sand, on tree 
trunks, on animal skins, and on rocks. They kept records with these methods and by 
another method of tying knots in rope. This is proof that our ancestors saw the need 
for keeping records, but it wasn’t until around 3000 BC that writing appeared. In the 
Book of Changes, it says that the ancients used knots in rope and wise men of later 
ages kept records in writing (Fig. 6.2). 
Left: When Europeans ﬁrst arrived in the Americas, they discovered local Peruvian 
natives using the quipu system. The ropes had different colors and knots to express 
complex ideas. 
Middle: In 1962, the Jiahu symbols were discovered at a site in Wuyang, Henan. 
The 17 distinct characters were written on tortoise shells and other materials more 
than 7000 years ago and are seen as being the source of Chinese characters. 
Right: The Sumerians began writing hieroglyphs around 3500 BC. The symbols 
engraved on this tablet represent cows, grain, ﬁsh, and show quantities of each. This 
may have been the ledge of a temple. It is proof that the written word evolved from 
symbols. 
Whether it’s knotting ropes or carving a symbol, the root of all this is to record. 
This need to record likely came from commercial transactions. A simple system of 
symbols for keeping a ledger eventually evolved into a more complicated system, 
which evolved into the written word. The appearance of the written word shook the 
world. In China, legend has it that Cang Jie invented the written word. Shuowen 
Jiezi, the ﬁrst comprehensive Chinese dictionary, says that Cang Jie was a historian 
for the Yellow Emperor and developed the written word from the footprints of birds

and animals.3 Legend has it that the day the written word was invented, all the 
supernatural beings in the world cried out.4 
These supernatural beings were crying out because the invention of the written 
word meant that humans were gaining independence. Before the written word, ghosts 
and spirits were spread throughout the world with the help of oral tradition. They 
made use of mankind’s fear to rule the world. But when the written word was invented 
and recording began, the domain of the supernatural began to shrink, being replaced 
by human systems of governance. The supernatural beings that had covered the world 
so thickly knew that their time was limited. They were crying because they knew 
that they would one day be forgotten. 
The appearance of the written word was the sign of civilization. As I explained 
before, the Chinese word for civilization is wenming, which combines the characters 
for “language” or “culture” with the character for “understanding” or “light.” The 
“light” in this case was like the sun for the natural world—but it was lighting the 
human intellect. With the written word, we could break through physical boundaries, 
liberate our minds; we could record our observations, experiences, thoughts, and 
achievements in a durable, shareable form, stimulating discussion among our peers 
and future generations. 
The word civilization refers to the time after the spread and inﬂuence of the written 
word; prehistory is what we call the time before the written word was invented. 
But there is another viewpoint, which is that the most important starting point 
of civilization was not the written word but language itself. It allowed people to 
communicate with each other and pass on ideas. It’s undeniable that this is an impor-
tant step into civilization but language could only be used for communication and not 
recording. Language was ﬂeeting. Experience and knowledge could only be passed 
on by word of mouth. Oral tradition was not a reliable way to do this. With the passing 
of a generation, only fragments of their experience could be passed down. Each subse-
quent generation would have to make many of the same discoveries already made 
by their ancestors. Time and energy had to be expended to replicate the efforts of 
previous generations, making the pace of building civilization quite slow. 
Language is not unique to humans, either. As time goes by, we have more and 
more research that proves birds, primates, whales, bats, and even insects are capable 
of communication. The traditional saying is that “humans have human language and 
animals have animal language”; there are many legendary examples from Chinese 
history of people with the ability to talk to beasts. There are now examples of animal 
language being used in modern science and technology. One example comes from 
a solution to airplane bird strikes. Even a small bird becomes like a bullet when 
it’s sucked into a jet engine. In a famous example, US Airways Flight 1549 hit a 
ﬂock of Canada geese on January 15, 2009, a minute and a half after taking off from 
LaGuardia. The Airbus lost power in both engines and was forced to make a landing

on the Hudson River. Keeping birds out of the path of airliners is not a task to be 
taken lightly. The current method involves playing a sound that will disturb birds, 
keeping them out of the path of aircraft. 
This is why it seems clear that the fundamental difference between humans and 
other animals is not language. What allowed us to rise above animals was the written 
word. If we look at a timeline of history, it becomes clear that the written word is the 
most decisive invention in the rapid development of civilization. Without the written 
word, few of our greatest inventions could have been possible. 
In order to see that development, we can condense the past 750,000 years of 
human civilization and chart it over the course of a year. Figure 6.3 shows that 
human civilization developed slowly in the absence of the written word. If human 
history was taking place in a single year, it would only be in the ﬁnal three days 
of the year that the written word allowed the development of human civilization to 
accelerate signiﬁcantly. The major events of human civilization, like the invention of 
papermaking, steam engines, electric motors, cars, the Internet, AlphaGo, etc. take 
place on what would be the last day of the year. 
Truly, we can say, “without the written word, humankind was stumbling in the 
darkness.” 
The most important reason for this is that the written word makes recording 
possible and recording makes possible the accumulation of civilization. Civilization 
relies on accumulation. Every civilization becomes the crystallization of the energies 
and intelligences of generations. If knowledge can be recorded, we can stand on the 
shoulders of our ancestors. That frees people up to focus their physical and mental 
energies on thinking about the unknown. That is how new knowledge is created. The 
recording made possible by the written word accelerates civilization. 
Writing not only records history and reﬁnes knowledge but also allows the rise 
of organization and management. When the consensus that a group has reached 
can be recorded, there is no more need to rely on the oral transmission of informa-
tion. Instructions can accurately spread across time and space. This is when rules and

laws begin to appear. These legal or administrative precedents become more durable, 
allowing a more advanced stage of human social organization. The ancient human 
civilizations that transformed their language into the written word have developed 
from tribes to nations, going onto a process of social division of labor and cooper-
ation. Those groups that did not convert language to the written word remained in 
subsistence conditions, primitive and backwards. 
Nations rise and fall; the years and then the century pass; one generation becomes 
the next; the living bury the dead; and all of these changes are recorded, passed on, 
and accumulated—and this is what creates civilization. 
6.3 
The Changing Fate of Chinese Civilization 
China invented the written word before any other country. It is therefore one of the 
foundational ancient civilizations. Sophisticated characters were being carved into 
tortoise shells as early as the Shang Dynasty. More than 3,500 years old, these ancient 
marks are known as the oracle bone inscriptions. 
In the Spring and Autumn Era (777–476 BC), the tortoise shells were replaced 
with wood and bamboo. The two words for what we might know as books are called 
zhujian, “bamboo strips” and mudu, “wooden tablets.” These objects were still quite 
cumbersome and inconvenient, as you can imagine. When Hui Shi, one of the famous 
strategists of the Warring States (475–221 BC) wanted to carry some books along 
while canvassing various bureaucrats, he had to be followed everywhere he went by 
ﬁve cartloads of bamboo strips and wooden tablets. There’s a Chinese idiom that 
comes from this, to the effect that someone is so learned that his “knowledge would 
need to be carried in ﬁve carts.” Back then, if some learned man wanted to move, he 
would need a team of oxen to move his collection of books, which gives us another 
phrase: “enough books to exhaust the cattle.” 
In the pre-Qin period, these books made from bamboo and wood allowed China 
to create a vibrant culture, producing many great thinkers, and laying the foundation 
for a uniﬁed Chinese civilization. 
In the Western Han (206 BC–AD 8), silk began to be used as the key medium for 
writing. That made books much lighter. But silk was expensive, putting it out of the 
reach of most people. Writing on silk was restricted mostly to the upper classes. 
In 105 AD, the Eastern Han (25–220) court ofﬁcial Cai Lun built on the discoveries 
of earlier generations and began the ﬁrst large scale production of paper. 
When it came to paper, China had a long headstart over the rest of the world. In the 
Eastern Han, it spread east to Korea, then Japan; in the south, it entered Vietnam; it 
passed into western regions in the Tang, then out into the Arab world. It wasn’t until 
the twelfth century that Europe caught up with Chinese paper production. Before 
paper, the medium for writing in Europe was sheepskin, which wasn’t as cheap or 
convenient as paper. 
In my opinion, the invention of paper and written language were reasons why 
Chinese civilization got off to a head start. Replacing bamboo strips and wooden

tablets with paper allowed for the convenient recording and dissemination of knowl-
edge. The literacy rate began rising in the Han, and there was improved social gover-
nance. China held its leading position until the fourteenth century. But, crucially, this 
relied on the manual copying of texts. 
The symbolic event that caused China and the West to diverge was the invention 
and popularization of the printing press. In 1454, Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468) 
gave the world movable type printing, allowing a thousandfold efﬁciency in copying 
texts and a signiﬁcant decrease in the cost. Printed texts began to spread, allowing the 
dissemination of information and knowledge through Western societies. In the half 
century after Gutenberg’s invention, tens of millions of books were printed, more 
than all the books published in the previous 1000 years.5 
The printing press allowed the rise of science in the Renaissance. As we have 
already seen, science and technology relies on a medium of record to develop. 
Before the invention of printing, the advancement of science and technology 
usually came from accidental achievements in manufacturing. Economist Yifu Lin 
has theorized that ancient China had an advantage in technology because of its large 
population, which spit out more random innovation, compared to sparsely populated 
Europe.6 After the printing press, Europe began to establish the scientiﬁc method 
of experimentation. Accidental innovation gave way to planning. The knowledge 
and discoveries generated by continued experimentation easily bested the random 
developments generated by Chinese craftsmen. 
China began to lag behind. 
The international status of Chinese porcelain is an example of this. Before the 
eighteenth century, Chinese porcelain had a near monopoly due to advances made 
in production. 
As Lin Yifu explains, major innovations in porcelain were accidental. The idea of 
glazing ceramics was discovered by kiln workers that realized coating objects in plant 
ash before ﬁring would leave a glassy ﬁnish. This natural glaze made objects more 
attractive, made them less likely to carry contaminants, and made them waterproof. 
This paved the way for other attempts at manmade glazes.7 
However, beginning in the eighteenth century, Europeans began their own experi-
mentation, aided by comprehensive records and quantitative analysis. Their porcelain 
began to surpass Chinese ceramics. 
Starting in 1700, the German alchemist Johann Friedrich Böttger (1682–1719) 
carried out more than 30,000 experiments with porcelain at a factory near Meissen. 
He kept complete records of each of his experiments, which means that a contempo-
rary producer could accurately recreate his product now. Ming and Qing ceramics, 
on the other hand, were produced without any records, meaning they cannot be accu-
rately reproduced. The English potter Josiah Wedgwood (1730–1795) used the same 
methods to carry out more than 5,000 experiments. He began with attempts to imitate

Chinese porcelain then went on to his own experiments. These experiments included 
incorporating bone ash into ceramics, producing the translucent and elegant product 
known as bone china. 
China presents a contrast with this approach, since the porcelain industry usually 
involved a master orally passing down knowledge to his apprentices. The lack of 
records or limited records was done to protect trade secrets. The master would instruct 
his charges on setting up a kiln or preparing materials, but this was not recorded, 
which meant that apprentices had to master temperatures and amounts of materials 
through study and experience. There is a famous line about “ingenuity in applying 
tactics”—and this meant that innovation came from sudden realization, rather than 
being passed down from generation to generation, from day to day, or from reading 
records. There were certainly signiﬁcant innovations among Chinese artisans but a 
lack of detailed records meant that they could be easily lost. Future generations could 
not necessarily rely on the advances of their ancestors. 
My hometown of Ji’an in Jiangxi (this was known as Jizhou) was a historical 
center of porcelain production. Jingdezhen (also known as Raozhou) is more famous 
now, but Jizhou was turning out high quality porcelain a millennium ago, too. There 
is a famous line that “Jizhou leads and Raozhou follows.”8 
The kilns at Jizhou fell by the wayside because of a war. In 1275, the Yuan attacked 
the Southern Song (1127–1279) and Wen Tianxiang dispatched his troops to defend 
the dynasty. According to historical records, 30,000 workers were transferred from 
the kilns to the frontlines. They were routed by the Yuan. Many of the kiln workers 
that survived went to Jingdezhen. 
This killed the vitality of the Jizhou ceramics industry. The ﬁres in the kilns were 
extinguished. The technology developed there was spread out through Jingdezhen. 
This is why Jingdezhen gained a primary position after the Yuan-Ming period. 
Porcelain used to symbolize and signify China, but it is now just another 
commodity on the international market. China still produces a lot of porcelain, but 
you probably won’t ﬁnd Chinese brands at a high-end department store anywhere in 
the world. Europeans hold 90% of the high-end porcelain market, with the remaining 
10% mostly divided up between the United States and Japan.9 
Another example is the study of anatomy. There is a vast gulf between thirteenth 
and sixteenth century European anatomy. This was not down to any major advances 
but the fact that printing technology after the fourteenth century allowed the dissemi-
nation of knowledge. More and more texts were printed on the subject. This increase 
in information would be impossible without the printing press. 
Without any way to record the process, the knowledge gained from a dissection 
is held only by the men wielding the scalpels. Nowadays, these things are recorded 
not only with text but also photo, video, or even livestreams. But before the printing
8 Record of Jingdezhen Ceramic: Volume 10, written by Lan Pu and Zheng Tinggui in the Qing 
dynasty contains the lines “Jiangxi ceramics were made in Hongzhou during the Tang and made 
in Jizhou in the Song,” and “Jizhou leads and Raozhou follows.” I am consulting an edition of the 
book published by Huangshan Publishing House in March, 2016.

press, there were only limited written records and oral transmission of knowledge. 
This is very limiting. The next person to take a scalpel to a body would likely not 
beneﬁt from the knowledge gleaned from the ﬁrst autopsy. 
In addition to written records, there were also systematic anatomical drawings 
made by physicians. If these drawings had to be traced by hand, they could never be 
perfect. If a drawing was copied ten times, then hundreds of copies made from those 
copies, distortions would be introduced. 
We can see another example of this in maritime charts. It was hard for sailors to 
ﬁnd any two maps that were the same. Since everything was copied by hand, there 
were distortions. Nobody was in agreement. 
In the age of the print press, that was no longer a problem. 
It’s because knowledge could be recorded and disseminated accurately that the 
printing press was so signiﬁcant to the development of civilization. 
Many scholars have noted the power of the printing press in the dissemination of 
knowledge, but I think they are missing something about why this was foundational. 
The essence of disseminating information is preservation and recording. Manual 
copying of a book is essentially recording it, and the printing press speeds up that 
process and increases the audience. At the level of the larger society, the efﬁciency of 
recording is improved. No matter how a hand copied book is preserved, there cannot 
be many copies. If it is destroyed or degraded by moisture, insects, or oxidation, 
it disappears. A ﬁre ripping through a library can mean a civilization rupture. But 
the printing press allowed a book to be printed in greater quantities and at different 
locations. This was a way for recording to defeat the ravages of time and allow human 
knowledge to be preserved and passed down on a large scale. 
Compared to Gutenberg’s moveable type, China’s letterpress printing suffered 
many setbacks over its long life. Many people attempted it but they seemed to always 
miss the mark. During the Tang, a system of engraving wooden blocks for printing 
was developed. This was not unlike the idea of carving seals. A sheet of a book is 
carved into wood, then stamped onto a surface. Each new book has to be carved in 
wood all over again. This greatly increased the cost of printing. It made sense to 
print the key books of Confucianism but few would take the leap into the unknown 
involved with printing new books. A thousand years after Cai Lun’s invention of 
paper, Song dynasty inventor Bi Sheng (970–1051) produced his own version of 
movable type. He was on the right track but he couldn’t master the technology. One 
problem was that he used clay tablets, which could not be reused many times and 
turned out to be fragile. In the early Qing dynasty, a version of movable type printing 
was developed with bronze. But the technology could not keep pace. In order to print 
the Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings from the Earliest to Current 
Times, 250,000 bronze movable-type characters were produced by the Qing court. 
After a ﬁrst run of prints, the Qianlong Emperor ran into ﬁnancial difﬁculties and 
the bronze printing characters were melted down for coins.10 
10 Wen (2014).

It was not until 1819, when English missionary Robert Morrison (1782–1834) 
printed the Bible, that moveable type printing began to spread in China.11 
That puts China 365 years behind Europe. 
Between 1454 and 1819, science and technology expanded rapidly in Europe, 
while China was seemingly stagnant. China in the nineteenth century was not signif-
icantly different from the Han dynasty 2000 years prior. People were reading the 
same books, and they were also farming the land with the same methods and tools. 
Pushed forward by the printing press, Europe went from a dark age to an enlight-
enment, building a system for storing its knowledge and history, and eventually 
kickstarting the Industrial Revolution. During this time, China still had not devel-
oped scientiﬁc experimentation. The key to experimentation is systematized and 
accurate recordings; these recordings could be passed down through generations. In 
China, however, knowledge was still being passed orally from teacher to disciple. 
This was not a problem when the knowledge being passed along were the doctrines 
of Confucius and Mencius; specialized knowledge, science and technology, micro-
innovation, and individual invention cannot be passed along in the same way. It was 
hard to ignite the ﬂame of innovation. It was too easy to extinguish. 
If information cannot spread and knowledge cannot be disseminated, how can 
society develop? 
Another serious aspect of Chinese society to consider is the respect for tradition. 
Basically, that meant that Chinese people always considered ancient people to have 
been wiser than themselves. The root of this way of thinking is the lack of records. 
For a long time, Chinese people believed that their ancestors knew better than 
them, even though their wisdom had never been recorded—or it had been lost. It 
is because there was no accurate record of what ancient people had done that their 
descendants could only guess at what they knew or didn’t know. That is why the 
respect for tradition arose. If the ancients were so knowledgeable, what was the use 
of trying to invent new methods or ﬁgure out new ideas? It was better to imitate 
the ancients. Many reforms in Chinese history have been abandoned because they 
“violated the traditional order.” That left the model of governance stagnant. I believe 
that a lack of records is at the root of this. 
This respect for ancient tradition has severely restricted the creativity and progress 
of the Chinese people. Advances in science and technology come from experimen-
tation and new discoveries, rather than from tradition and the words of ancient 
sages. 
I think there’s one particularly interesting example of the impact that a lack of 
printing technology had on China’s development.

The Fate of Three Books on Three Continents 
A Dream of Red Mansions is one of China’s best known novels and is regarded as 
the pinnacle of Chinese literature. 
Despite its reputation, there are many unsolved mysteries about the book. The 
most fundamental is about authorship: experts cannot agree whether it was penned 
by Cao Xueqin or Gao E. Out of all the different versions of the book, it is also 
unclear which should be considered deﬁnitive. 
It is because of these mysteries that China has produced the ﬁeld of Red-ology, 
dedicated to studying the novel. 
According to the Red-ologists, A Dream of Red Mansions was likely written in the 
1760s and spread through multiple private copies. There were at least 120 versions 
of the book, including 70 printed versions.12 The Gengchen manuscript of 1760 is 
widely considered the most signiﬁcant and complete.13 It was not printed in complete 
form until Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan put it together in 1791 for Suzhou’s Cuiwen 
Book House, combining the ﬁrst 80 chapters with an additional 40 chapters. The 
1791 print was called the Chengjia edition (“Cheng-A edition” and a second printing 
in 1792 was called the Chengyi edition (“Cheng-B edition”). 
In these 120 various versions of Dream, there are many errors and inconsistencies. 
The Chengyi edition glumly reports this fact: “The various versions of the novel create 
confusion. They are inconsistent and contradictory. You may ﬁnd one chapter in one 
book and search fruitlessly for it in another. Differentiating the authentic from the 
false is like trying to pluck nuggets of jade out of gravel.”14 Table 6.1 contains several 
examples that I have drawn from Red-ologist scholars. 
These comparisons between versions debate which might be more in line with the 
author’s original vision, but they are all inconclusive. It’s nearly impossible to ﬁnd 
a version that is not contradicted by other versions. The reason for this is that Ming 
and Qing China lacked an effective means of recording. Books could only spread by 
being hand copied. 
In ancient times, copying books was specialized work. The popular works that 
survived down through the ages only survived because someone copied them 
verbatim, each character, stroke by stroke… Historical ﬁgures like Sima Qian, Ban 
Chao, and Zhuge Liang did stints copying books. There is a poem by Master Zhu of 
the Song that goes: “A life spent putting ink on the page/At the end, the few hairs 
left are on the brush.” Basically, the old men copying books had worked until they 
had lost all their hair and also worn out their brushes.
12 Su (1981). 
13 The original Gengchen edition was compiled in 1760 and had 78 chapters altogether. Title pages 
contained a commentary. 
14 This is an adaptation of the original lines, which actually describe the process as one of differenti-
ating jade from “swallow stone” (a type of stone from Swallow Mountain that was said to resemble 
precious stones).

Table 6.1 The similarities and differences between various versions of Dream15 
Copying books by hand is quite slow, ﬁrst of all. The shortest works might take 
a few days, but long books could take years.16 Second, mistakes are unavoidable. 
That can lead to the spread of misinformation or ambiguity. To speed up the process, 
one person usually dictated a text while a team individually copied down their own 
versions. That is how many errors were introduced. It might be that the copyists 
misheard the dictator. Another issue was that sometimes copyists would deliber-
ately change the original text, adding their own interpretation. Along the way, some 
scholars would add commentaries or insert their own notes. If someone is copying 
a text, it can be unclear who the original author is. These copied books don’t carry 
metadata, such as location, date, or the name of the copyist, so there is no way for 
the reader to trace the authenticity of the work. 
Romance of the Three Kingdoms, another classic novel, has more than a hundred 
versions, as well, dating back to the Ming and Qing. As with Dream, it can be 
difﬁcult to verify authenticity among them. The reason for so many versions of 
Three Kingdoms is the same as the reason for the multiplicity of Dreams: the books 
were copied by hand. In the 1930s, the literary thinker Hu Shih summed it up like

this: “Three Kingdoms is not the work of a single author but a joint work written 
across ﬁve centuries.”17 
Compared with the era of writing on bamboo slips and wooden tablets, copying 
books on paper was an improvement. It would be impossible without Cai Lun’s 
innovation. This was certainly an improvement, since it didn’t require the direct oral 
transmission of information from master to disciple. In ancient times, that master-
disciple relationship was often one of close personal dependency. Oral transmission 
relied on an intimate relationship. The teacher could decide what to pass on and 
what not to. With a book, the student can access information independently of their 
teacher—and possibly even surpass their knowledge. For a student in those times, a 
book could change their destiny. 
The invention of paper allowed for some degree of personal liberation, but the 
popularization of printing magniﬁed that effect. 
Let us now turn to Europe at the same time. 
Right around the time that Dream was being written, a masterpiece was published 
in Germany. This was The Sorrows of Young Werther, written in 1774 by Johann 
Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832). It caused a sensation and became a best-seller. 
How was the Sorrows of Young Werther published? Before Gutenberg’s invention, 
Europe was in about the same state as China in that books were copied by hand. But 
after 1500, publishing houses began appearing in big cities and smaller centers. 
Goethe began contacting specialist booksellers and went to the Leipzig Book Fair, 
where manuscripts were traded and sold. The Leipzig Book Fair was the largest in 
Germany and is still held to this day. That was where Goethe found a publisher for 
Sorrows. This created a “Werther fever” in Germany. Many young readers began 
emulating the novel’s protagonist, wearing the same clothes, and even imitating his 
suicide. Goethe wrote a preface to a 1775 edition that warned readers not to imitate its 
protagonist. Sorrows swept the continent. There were six French translations between 
1775 and 1778; 1779–1788 saw translations into English, Italian, and Russian.18 
Compared to the fuzzy nature of Chinese society at the time, Europe could be 
seen in higher deﬁnition. 
Placing these two masterpieces against each other, I personally prefer Dream to 
Sorrows. Dream is more comprehensive and profound. It’s clearly the more sophis-
ticated work. But the publishing system that produced it is nothing like the one that 
produced Sorrows. In Europe, a market system for books was created, allowing for a 
novel to spread quickly and have a large social impact. Meanwhile, Dream was still 
being copied by hand. No matter its literary achievement, its spread and inﬂuence 
were limited. That is only down to the social recording apparatus in the form of 
publishing that Europe had at the time.19

19 Of course, we cannot discount the political environment that affected the publication of A Dream  
of Red Mansions. There are many political allusions and metaphors in the book that made it 
inconvenient to formally publish. But the fundamental reason was because of printing technology.

Data Civilization: How Recording Technology Empowers …
Finally, we will shoot over to North America. 
In the 1770s, the continent was still a colonial territory. The best-selling book was 
Common Sense by Thomas Paine (1736–1809), published in 1776. Paine had come 
to the British American colonies from England in 1774. The book was an immediate 
success. 120,000 copies were printed in the ﬁrst run and an additional 500,000 copies 
were printed over the following two years.20 At the time, there were only two million 
people in North America, which meant that virtually every adult male had read the 
book. It stimulated the local interest in independence, and it added to an ongoing 
discussion about freedom, democracy, and equality. It helped push the colonies to 
decide to declare their independence. 
Historians today are unanimous on the role the book played in American inde-
pendence. Common Sense was a bugle, calling ﬁghters to the War of Independence. 
In that war, the pen was as mighty as the sword—and perhaps mightier still was the 
printing press. Without Common Sense and the printing press, the War of Indepen-
dence might have been indeﬁnitely postponed. John Adams (1735–1826), the second 
President of the United States said that ideas are the forerunner of revolution; he said 
that the key ideas that led to the American Revolution came from Common Sense. 
A book gave birth to a nation. 
The emergence and spread of the print press promoted social recording appara-
tuses in Europe and the United States. But China fell behind because of its backwards 
recording methods and the inefﬁciency of producing, preserving, and disseminating 
knowledge. From around the fourteenth century, the gap began to widen in the ﬁelds 
of science and technology, economics, and politics, eventually putting Europe far 
ahead. 
6.5 
“Computer” Versus “Recorder”: The Secret Code 
at the Heart of the Advancement of Commercial 
Civilization 
As we saw in the ﬁrst chapter, the new economy relies on new types of commercial 
practices; new types of commercial practices rely on the use of data. Data use becomes 
a systematized pattern. What I want to discuss in this chapter is not only the state of 
new business practices but the development of modern Commercial Civilization and 
how that was achieved through continuously expanding the scope and standardization 
of recording. 
Luca Pacioli (1447–1517) was a pioneer of modern accounting and among the ﬁrst 
to propose a double-entry system of book-keeping. Pacioli thought that a successful 
businessperson should be able to record their commercial activities to gain insight 
into their ﬁnances and balance their accounts. This is not as simple as recording 
ﬁgures on a piece of paper but involves a scientiﬁc method. The core principle of 
double-entry book-keeping is that a change in one account must be matched with a
20 This is taken from the Wikipedia entry. 

6.5 “Computer” Versus “recorder”: The Secret Code at the Heart …
149
change in another account. Both debits and credits are recorded; the sum of debits 
made in a day’s transactions must equal the sum of all credits. 
This sounds simple, but we shouldn’t underestimate its importance. The double-
entry system of recording ﬁnancial data laid the foundations for Commercial Civi-
lization and built the prosperity of the capitalist countries. Venice and Genoa became 
ﬁnancial centers of Europe in the century after they became the ﬁrst locations to 
adopt this method of accounting. 
Early capitalism took this system of managing companies to the level of managing 
states. An entire government’s ﬁnancial system could be tracked. A statesman ﬁnally 
had the ability to track the ﬂow, increase and decrease, direction, and change of social 
resources. This data could be managed because it was systematized and integrated. 
Apart from precision management, it also promoted exchange and circulation. 
Since ancient times, China has had the concept of accounting. The term for it— 
kuaiji—is mentioned in the Records of the Grand Historian of Sima Qian, written 
in the second century BC. Since the Xia dynasty of the 3rd millennium BC, there 
was a system by which feudal lords would pay taxes to the government. The earliest 
concepts of accounting came from calculating, assessing, and recording the amounts 
of tribute paid by the lords.21 There is even a mountain near Shaoxing, Zhejiang 
called Kuaiji, so Shaoxing is usually considered the birthplace of accounting. China, 
however, persisted in single-entry bookkeeping until embryonic forms of double-
entry accounting appeared in the late Ming and early Qing. The system wasn’t intro-
duced fully into China until it arrived from Japan in the early twentieth century.22 At 
that point, the traditional methods of bookkeeping were completely replaced. 
Ray Huang’s ideas on “numerical management” come from looking at this historic 
tendency in China. His goal was to avoid traditional Chinese historiography and 
explain history technically. He focused on the ability to manage numerical ﬁgures. 
His thesis was that it was China’s lack of numerical management that it began to fall 
behind Western civilization in the fourteenth century: 
The biggest problem is by the time Western Europe and Japan had begun organizing affairs of 
government in the spirit of commercial enterprises, China still had a population of hundreds 
of millions that were not being governed numerically.23 
Once we entered Industrial Civilization, the impact of records became even more 
clear. 
Typewriters began to be popularized in the United States in the 1870s. Prior 
to that, things like order forms, manifests, accounts, and business correspondence 
had to be manually written with pen and paper. The typewriter sped things up by 
three times.24 That was another leap forward in recording efﬁciency. At around the 
same time, carbon copy paper began to appear, which meant that typists could make 
multiple copies of a text at once, greatly improving internal corporate management 
and external communication.

Data Civilization: How Recording Technology Empowers …
The greatest innovation of that period was the cash register. The impetus for the 
invention was to stop embezzlement or theft by people handling cash. In 1884, the 
National Cash Register Company (NCR) was founded and went on to sell 22 million 
of their devices over the next thirty years.25 This changed the business environment 
and made NCR one of the country’s most important ﬁrms. At the time, it was esti-
mated that a sixth of major American CEOs had passed through NCR. Its status in 
American business could be likened to the Whampoa Military Academy in Chinese 
politics. It even produced IBM founder Thomas J. Watson (1874–1956). 
The earliest cash registers were mechanical and did not produce usable data, but by 
around the First World War, they could begin recording transactions, perform basic 
calculations, and had rudimentary accounting functions. In 1965, IBM introduced 
bar code technology, pushing cash register automation to a new level. 
Another important invention of the time was the punch card time clock. It recorded 
by punching a hole in a piece of paper the time employees entered and exited their 
workplace, or how long it took to complete a job. Before IBM took its current title 
in 1914, it was called the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (founded in 
1911) and their main product, as their name suggests, was mechanical time recorders 
for employees. 
Ten years ago, when I ﬁnished my schooling in the States, I went to work at an 
American company. I discovered that every employee had to ﬁll out an online form 
called a time card management system (this is also called a timesheet system). On 
the form, we had to ﬁll in the time we had spent on various work. For example, you 
would ﬁll in that you spent 2.5 h on such-and-such a project, then spent 1.75 h on 
another project; even the length of lunch and breaks had to be entered. Based on this 
data, department managers could analyze the progress of projects and control costs. 
Apart from keeping track of progress and costs, I once saw this data put to remark-
able use in a business negotiation. The company was approached by a client to build 
some software but they believed that our quote was too high. When things seemed to 
be at a stalemate, we went back into timesheet data and showed exactly how much 
labor cost had gone into a similar project. We proved that our quote was completely 
fair and the client accepted. 
This kind of system is not particularly complicated and has a history of at least a 
hundred years in the United States. I worked in China between 1996 and 2006 and 
returned in 2014, and what I saw was that very few companies had adopted the time 
card management system. When I asked why, some managers told me that they felt 
the data input by employees was unreliable. I don’t believe that’s actually the case. 
At the end of the day, they simply had no awareness of the need for mass personnel 
management or the importance of data. 
Beginning in the 1880s, American managers had recognized the importance of 
records to tracking and managing business operations. In 1886, management theo-
rist Henry Metcalfe (1847—1927) presented his work to the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers and summed the situation up like this:
25 Ibid. 

6.5 “Computer” Versus “recorder”: The Secret Code at the Heart …

Now, administration without records is like music without notes—by ear. Good as far as it 
goes, which is but a little way; it bequeaths nothing to the future. Except in the very rudest 
industries, carried on as if from hand to mouth, all recognize that the present must prepare 
for the demands of the future, and hence records, more or less elaborate, are kept.26 
During this period, the scientiﬁc management ideas of Frederick Taylor (1856– 
1915) were also emerging. Taylor advocated scientiﬁc observation, recording, and 
analysis; labor productivity would be increased through “time and motion studies.” 
Taylor’s ideas and those of Metcalfe meshed perfectly. Metcalfe set up a system by 
which any actions or links between people would be recorded: “For every act or 
name to be recorded, there shall be a separate card; so that the cards being combined 
or classiﬁed, the acts or names they represent will be so too.”27 
The information from the cards could be integrated and then transcribed into a 
more permanent record. 
Cards were once the most popular and practical recording method in the world. 
In the 1890s, Herman Hollerith (1860–1929) invented a tabulating machine for 
punched cards for use in that year’s American census.28 Every card was an indi-
vidual unit, punched according to standardized rules; the tabulating machine could 
quickly analyze these cards and output information for a table. 
These tables were themselves an important method of commercial recording. 
The structure of a table makes information consistent, making it more readable for 
managers, but also allowing for data to be extracted for recording and processing. 
This innovation was what allowed IBM to grow into the giant that it became. The 
punch tabulation machine was ﬁrst used in enterprises that required analyzing a 
large amount of data, such as railway companies that had to deal with a mountain of 
passenger and freight information each day: each passenger has to be sold a ticket, 
have their ticket punched, and be counted; every piece of freight has a particular 
origination and destination, and things like transfers, tariffs, consignment fees have 
to be tracked. This complex and strict process requires mastering a large amount of 
data. 
IBM got a massive opportunity in 1935, when FDR’s New Deal introduced the 
Social Security Act and the Wage-Hour Act. These two laws mandated employers 
establish ﬁles for their employees and contribute to state social security based on 
wages and hours worked. That meant that more ﬁrms had a need for punch card 
machines. IBM had a near monopoly. 
The punch card machine laid the foundation for the modern computer. In 1948, 
IBM produced its ﬁrst large-scale digital calculating machine. It took up three walls 
in a large room and cost half a million dollars but it could perform thousands of 
calculations a second. 
Thomas J. Watson of IBM looked at the colossus and exclaimed that the world 
market would probably only require ﬁve of the machines. Today, now that nearly

every household has a computer in it, this seems like an outrageous statement. But I 
beg to differ. It was quite reasonable. 
Most people ﬁnd it irrational because they ignore the difference between recording 
and calculating. 
In the era of Watson, computers strictly performed calculations. In 1946, an early 
digital calculating machine was used to process American census data, and the ﬁrst 
IBM computers were used in NASA’s Apollo program. At that time, there were not 
many large-scale computing tasks. In fact, the same remains true. 
Today, we might think of our laptops and phones as types of computers, but they 
do far more recording than actual computing. If you don’t believe me, pick up your 
phone… It’s ten times more powerful than a computer was in 1946, but its main 
functions are recording: take a picture, make a payment, post on WeChat, post on 
Weibo, log into a website… Rather than performing calculations in a traditional 
sense, these functions produce or access records. 
Very few people use computers for anything but recording. Nine out of ten func-
tions on the computer are recording functions. We should call them “recorders” 
instead of computers. 
Commercial Civilization has progressed through the expanding scope of recording 
and the subsequent introduction of management models. Whether we’re talking about 
Ray Huang’s numeric management, Taylor’s scientiﬁc management, or IBM’s punch 
card machine, we can identify a common core, which is expanding recording and 
standardizing the information. Commercial Civilization grows out of recordkeeping. 
We can trace its evolution by grasping the threads of the development of recording. 
In fact, all of civilization is based on recording, so there’s no reason that business 
would be an exception.

Humiliated in an Elevator 
After I graduated from university in 1996, I joined the Border Defense Corps of the 
People’s Armed Police (PAP). My provincial unit had around 20,000 members. A 
few years after joining, I moved from a technical post to a border management ofﬁce. 
In a force like the PAP, even people in technical positions have to write speeches 
and reports to their commanding ofﬁcers. Once I moved into administration, those 
reports became even more important. 
At the time, I was the average STEM graduate, capable of writing code but not 
particularly conﬁdent when it came to formal writing. 
My superior was a deputy section chief with an acid tongue. Shortly after transfer-
ring, he asked when I was from. Jiangxi, I told him. He shook his head and said, “Not 
a lot of honest people from Jiangxi. Bad people.” I wasn’t good at formal writing, so 
he often had to edit my work. He never missed an opportunity to criticize me. “Did 
you actually go to university or not?” he would ask me. As far as he was concerned, 
he would rather deal with a local boy that had joined the force without bothering 
with school.

6.6 Humiliated in an Elevator
153
One day as I was leaving work, he followed me into the elevator, lecturing me the 
whole time. There were a few people in the elevator from other departments, so they 
had to listen to him dressing me down. He ranted about the errors in my work. “You 
don’t understand any of this,” he said. “Not a single thing.” All I could do was stare 
at the elevator buttons and hope that it would soon be over. 
Being scolded in the elevator was the push I needed. I wanted to learn to write, but 
I wasn’t sure how. As a STEM graduate, I wasn’t afraid to learn, but I didn’t know 
where to start. I felt like the truth was buried somewhere and I didn’t even have a 
shovel. 
I found some unexpected inspiration on a business trip. The prized possession of 
the head of the Guangdong Border Defense Corps Sixth Detachment in Shenzhen 
was a thick sheaf of newspaper clippings. I was shocked. This powerful middle-aged 
man was in charge of 3000 men but he still had time to cut clips out of newspapers. 
When I asked him, the boss smiled at the question and told him that it was a very 
useful exercise. 
I started my own binder of clippings. I divided it into sections and started collecting 
various materials. I took clips from People’s Daily, Liberation Army News, People’s 
Armed Police Report, and Public Security Report. Whenever I saw a good article, I 
cut it out and pasted it into my notebook. After pasting it, I would take the sheet and 
put it into the correct category. 
No matter where I went, the binder went with me. I read articles aloud to myself. 
This method worked even better than I expected. My writing ability rapidly 
improved. Six months or so later, I got a call from my boss asking me to clarify 
a point. I gave my explanation and he hung up without saying a word. 
It was the ﬁrst time that he had not made any criticisms. 
I still have those binders of newspaper clippings. I am forever grateful for having 
developed this habit. Many other people have the same practice. One reason that Lin 
Biao was such a great general was because of his habit of recording everything. I 
wrote about his habits in another book.29 Sam Walton (1918–1992), the founder of 
Walmart jotted down notes whenever he talked to anyone: 
As soon as he meets you, he’ll look you up and down, tilt his head, and then squeeze you 
for ideas, occasionally stopping to jot down notes, and two hours pass before you know it, 
and he leaves you completely hollowed out. 
Walton often took out his notebook when patrolling his stores. One account has 
him down on his hands and knees, inspecting products stored under a table, then 
turning to ask an associate how he took that inventory into account when making an 
order. Every word the associate said was jotted down in a blue spiral notebook.30 
The American author Jack London (1876–1916) was also a habitual notekeeper. 
He had pieces of paper stuffed in all of his pockets, so he could always make a note. 
He would constantly take out his notes to read aloud, even if he was at dinner or 
in bed. He famously hung clothes lines around his room so that he could peg up

note cards. Everything he thought or said went onto note cards. These would later 
form the core of his work. He died without having exhausted all the material.31 The 
Chinese historian Yang Kuisong has said that he keeps tens of thousands of index 
cards to record information.32 
The index card is a database that we can hold in our hands. 
We’re talking about a way that we can record the world around us or information 
about other people, but there is another type of recording that is focused on our own 
thoughts… I’m talking about the diary. A diary or journal records and summarizes 
events during a day. I’ve kept a diary but it’s been on-again, off-again. The interesting 
thing to me is that looking back on the past thirty years of my career, the periods 
where I kept a diary were the most fruitful for me, and the periods where I stopped 
keeping a diary tended to be slack times. The connection between progress in my 
career and journaling seems clear. 
There are many viewpoints from history on the role of diaries. I was inspired by 
Qing ofﬁcial Zeng Guofan’s letters. He wrote a diary every day, as well as reading 
ten pages of history and jotting down quotes. He wanted to continue without any 
interruption. He said that he would continue the effort even if he was traveling. He 
swore to never let a day go by without writing his journals.33 
Zeng Guofan divided his diary into three categories. The ﬁrst was his day’s work 
and itinerary, noting meetings and details; the second category was notes on reading 
and important issues; the third category was the most casual, recording things said by 
guests at dinner, or topics that had sparked some inspiration during a conversation. 
Everything was carefully and completely recorded. 
Zeng Guofan achieved many things in his lifetime and his family line produced 
many important people that went on to play key roles in modern China. Zeng Guofan’s 
individual self-cultivation and practices were crucial to the success of his family. 
Just like a nation or a society, a person that is committed to recording things, does 
it efﬁciently, and has a system for it will be successful. From my own professional 
experience, I would go so far as to say that I haven’t seen anyone not succeed that 
had a dedicated way to record their own life experiences. It would be unthinkable to 
me that someone with such a system wouldn’t go on to success. 
The reason I bring up these examples is that I have personally realized that 
recording is crucial, whether to the success of an individual or to human civilization. 
Comprehensive recording and complete calculation: creating the Digital Civiliza-
tion. 
Civilization comes from records. The printing press provided a signiﬁcant leap 
forward in recording capability and propelled civilizations in Europe and America. 
Today, a new invention is going to do the same.

As we have already discussed, the Internet is sedimentary—and the fragments that 
accumulate and consolidate to form it are data. It’s like a continental shelf, slowly 
being built up by innumerable pieces of data and information. But the inﬂuence of 
the Internet will extend beyond the commercial sector. The Internet is a recording 
apparatus that can be applied to the entire social sphere. When the printing press 
appeared in the ﬁfteenth century, its use was mostly conﬁned to enterprises or other 
large organizations. There was no way for most people to run a printing press them-
selves. But the Internet represents a technology that is integrated into the lives of 
every member of society. Compared to the era of the printing press, the fact that the 
Internet penetrates down to every member of society means that it is tens of millions 
of times more powerful. 
Take Wikipedia as an example. Established in 2001, it is now the world’s most 
important encyclopedia and the largest website for knowledge exchange. In English 
alone, there are 5.56 million entries. This was all accomplished through the work of 
volunteers.34 
Another way of looking at Wikipedia is as a systematic recording tool. 
We have already discussed the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, which 
caused nearly 200 casualties. News of this event spread quickly around the world. But 
there were not many reporters on the ground in the immediate aftermath, so rumors 
started to circulate. At 7:27 that evening, Wikipedia created a “Boston Marathon 
bombing” entry. The content in the entry was being updated almost once a minute, 
despite the fact that few reporters were on the scene. Media reports began to be 
sourced directly from the Wikipedia entry. In a single day, there were 7732 revisions 
to the entry by 1705 individuals around the world. It has now become a detailed, 
comprehensive source of information, which includes pictures and text. It runs to 
6000 words, with 355 citations. Translation of the English-language entry served as 
the basis for 40 other multilingual entries. 
Sites like Wikipedia, designed for knowledge exchange, are based on the social 
recording function of crowdsourced content and funding. 
WeChat, Weibo, Taobao, DiDi, and Baidu each have different functions related to 
social networking, e-commerce, and search, but the core function of each platform is 
recording. Taobao records shopping, WeChat records social networking, and Baidu 
records Internet records and search history, but their models all begin by storing data. 
As we have already seen, at the beginning of the rise of Commercial Civilization, 
cards of various sorts (punch cards, time cards, index cards) were a crucial recording 
device. WeChat and Weibo are quite similar to these cards, even though they are 
digitized. It is much easier to integrate and propagate a digital card than a paper card 
(Fig. 6.4). 
Top: A screenshot of the entry as it looked when it was created at 7:27 EST on 
April 15th, 2013. 
Bottom: The entry as it looked in January 2018. It’s divided into 10 sections, 
containing more than 6000 words.

Fig. 6.4 “Boston Marathon bombing” Wikipedia entry 
New online platforms like Meituan and Dianping also have a recording function. 
Apart from keeping track of restaurant locations, menus, contact information, etc., 
they also allow the public to share their opinions. This makes them a bit different 
from Wikipedia. Information about the world can be divided into two categories: 
opinions and facts. Facts would be what we would ﬁnd on the “Boston Marathon 
bombing” entry on Wikipedia, and opinions are what we would ﬁnd in Dianping 
or Meituan restaurant reviews. Facts are objective; opinions tend to be subjective 
(Fig. 6.5). 
Both types of websites are becoming more important to the Internet, and that 
has global importance. Whether we’re searching on Google or Baidu, the top results 
will often be sites like Wikipedia or Baidu’s Baike encyclopedia, or review sites like 
Dianping. We’ve already discussed soil as a metaphor and data as the soil for a new 
world, and sites like Wikipedia and Dianping represent particularly rich soil. For 
building a new Data Civilization, these platforms will provide bumper harvests. 
Looking back on the development of the Internet, the purpose of its networking 
seems clearly to build a systematic social recording system. What we have in the 
Internet is the infrastructure also for comprehensive social recording. The printing 
press allows the spread of information and can open up who can read certain material,

are the digital version of the 
recording card 
but the Internet expands that function. In the Internet age, we are not only all readers 
but we are all potentially authors and publishers. All of us have at our ﬁngerprints a 
recording device much more powerful than the printing press. 
I have stressed that knowledge comes from recording. When a society has estab-
lished a recording system and the data it’s recording can be analyzed, integrated, as 
well as freely available for access, it shines a light on the world. Fewer people will 
be left out in the dark. Even the most marginalized people will see beneﬁts. Search 
represents a new form of calculation; a society with comprehensive recording also 
allows for complete calculation. 
Let’s say a seven- or eight-year-old comes up and asks you a question… It’s 
very difﬁcult to get away with trying to trick them, since they can very quickly ﬁnd 
the truth online. That is why traditional authorities, such as parents and teachers, 
are being challenged today. When paper making was invented a thousand years ago, 
books could be written and disseminated more widely and conveniently, reducing the 
dependence on the oral transmission of information between teacher and student— 
and a similar process of liberating is taking place today. Nobody can monopolize 
knowledge. As long as they can use the internet to ﬁnd their answer, a child can 
challenge their teacher’s inconsistencies with the help of Google or Baidu.

Data Civilization: How Recording Technology Empowers …
The most enduring pursuit in human life is for the light. Nobody wants to be left 
in the dark. In the Bible, when the world is still formless and void on the ﬁrst day, 
God commands, “Let there be light.” This was a natural, physical light to illuminate 
the world. It became the basis for the existence and growth of all living things on 
Earth. The written word helped bring humanity out of chaos and barbarism. The 
Chinese word for civilization—wenming, combining the characters for “language” 
and “light”—suggests that it is the written word that is illuminating society. 
Today, in addition to the written word, data provides another kind of illumination. 
In the past, different ethnic groups and regions used different scripts for their written 
language. These written languages illuminated their respective users’ civilizations, 
but they did so in different ways. At its highest level, employed in powerful ways, 
the written word was like a torch, illuminating a nation’s intellectual, spiritual, and 
cultural spaces; primitive, undeveloped writing is like a candle, casting limited light, 
which is always in danger of going out; and these torches and candles are distributed 
unevenly around the world. Today, data, broken down into binary 1 s and 0 s can 
become the universal language. The light data casts is far greater than that of the 
torches and candles of the written word. Data is a new sun, illuminating the entire 
data space. 
This is a new age of Data Civilization. To adopt that Chinese word again, we 
could say we are going from wenming to shuming—this combines the character for 
“data” and “light.” 
Data Civilization will surpass the civilization of the written word. 
Language can be used to exchange ideas and the written word can be used for 
recording, but humanity has already realized the limitations of a civilization built on 
these elements. 
Language and the written word have the problem of imprecision in carrying 
meaning. For example, say that I tell you a certain person is sincere. The deﬁni-
tion of sincerity is vague enough that you might have a different understanding of 
it than I do. Let’s say I tell you a person is tall. Does that mean he’s 6′3′′ or 7′3′′? 
Everyone has different standards. 
Due to the different origins of various spoken and written languages, their preci-
sion can vary, sometimes in extreme ways. Cho-yun Hsu and I once discussed this 
problem. He said that Russian was the ideal language for poetry, while English and 
French were perfect for law. In his view, Chinese was somewhere in the middle, 
making it perfect for writing essays and prose. 
Poetry requires creativity and ambiguity; the text itself is brief but deep; and legal 
writing requires a high degree of precision and accuracy, with clear deﬁnitions of 
terms that avoid ambiguity. It is said that French has the strictest lexical rules of any 
language, which is the reason that it is a common language of international law. 
As a language, Chinese has a great deal of ambiguity. This has been examined 
by a great number of linguists and falls outside of the conﬁnes of this particular 
book. But ambiguity can produce great literary beauty; precision and accuracy are 
not necessarily esthetically beautiful. Beauty is inaccurate and inaccuracy is often 
beautiful. Nobody would describe the General Principles of the Civil Law of the

6.6 Humiliated in an Elevator
159
People’s Republic of China as a beautiful literary work, but there is wide agreement 
that the Book of Songs is aesthetically appealing. 
Also, when language and written words are used to record things, there are things 
that are difﬁcult to express, scenes difﬁcult to describe, and ideas that are not clear. 
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the United States had a fairly ambiguous 
deﬁnition of obscenity and there were frequent court cases when material was classi-
ﬁed as obscene. In the 1964 case of Jacobellis v. Ohio, a movie theater manager named 
Nico Jacobellis was charged with obscenity for showing a French ﬁlm called The 
Lovers. Nico Jacobellis had to take his case to the Supreme Court. They overturned 
the lower court’s decision 6:3. 
Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart believed that the concept of obscenity could 
not be deﬁned in words: “But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved 
in this case is not that.”35 
The pictures and video that Justice Potter Stewart saw are today’s data. What 
I mean is that all products of recording, including the written word, are data. The 
written word is only one method of recording. If we say that the written word is 
speciﬁcally gold, then data is more generally metal; in this analogy, data is much 
more expansive and inclusive. 
Data Civilization will shine brighter than a civilization based on language and the 
written word. This brightness will not be conﬁned to individuals but also business 
and society. As we have already seen, everyone will have individual representations 
in digital space, which can be brought to increase the deﬁnition with which we can 
view society. The power of data will allow us to see society with more clarity than 
we could for thousands of years. Of course, there are issues with this. Data and 
privacy go hand-in-hand; privacy will become the main social issue. It will take a 
long time for the data rights to be fully established. It remains possible that autocratic 
or authoritarian governments could use their command of data’s patterns as a tool of 
social command. 
Looking back, it was the Internet that laid the foundation for Data Civilization 
and the spread of smartphones built upon that. Everyone suddenly had a recording 
tool in their hands that was many magnitudes more powerful than the printing press. 
Everyone could record whenever and wherever they wanted; we became readers 
and writers at the same time. Comprehensive records and complete calculations will 
empower everyone to build civilization. Since the Internet provides the infrastructure 
for the social recording, it will provide the medium for releasing the most amazing 
innovation since the development of the written word, reshaping human nature and 
the world, and building a completely new Data Civilization.

New Data Governance: Building 
a Modern National Administrative 
System 
Abstract How can we use big data to govern a state? That is a question that I 
addressed in my ﬁrst two books and this chapter will elaborate on what I have 
learned from my observations. In the past, cities had a nervous system but no brain, 
but now we are entering a new age. Urban data is being integrated for AI to analyze 
and process. The government of the future will master data and use an intelligent 
network to deal with it. Compared to the traditional Chinese idea of a ruler having 
a mandate through virtue, the key to modernization of governance lies in “data 
governance”. That is the only road to modernizing government. 
7.1 
The Road to a Better Society is Always Under 
Construction 
In this chapter, we will cast our gaze back on the modern world, contemporary society, 
and China. 
In November of 2013, the Communist Party’s Third Plenary Session of the 18th 
Central Committee proposed: “The overall goal of deepening the reform compre-
hensively is to improve and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to 
promote the modernization of the national governance system and capacity.”1 
As I see it, a new model of governance has to rely on data. The moderniza-
tion of data collection, administration, and capacity is the modernization of state 
administration and state capacity.

7.2 
Digital Foundation: World Class Creativity and Local 
Problems 
We are building a data space beyond physical space. Just as the physical space has 
bedrock, the data space does, too, with the digital foundation anchoring it like the 
pilings of an apartment block. 
The key element of the digital foundation is data about individuals and juridical 
persons. 
With a population of 1.39 billion, China is the most populous country on the 
planet.2 Society is composed of people; people are the most elementary, dynamic, 
critical element of society. The main goal of social governance is administering and 
serving people. Human social activity is also the largest source of data. In The Peaks 
of Data, I described why the problem of sourcing demographic data has presented 
such an issue for historical and contemporary states around the world. It remains true 
that most countries do not have the ability to give an accurate population number. The 
leaders of most Chinese cities are hazy on actual demographics, especially when it 
comes to what is known as the ﬂoating population, which includes migrant workers. 
Most urban policies are related to demography; not having accurate population 
numbers means that decisions are being made without a high deﬁnition picture of 
the city. 
As a result, the idea of “close enough” rules the day. 
On January 1, 2016, China began to implement a two-child policy. Many experts 
predicted that there would be a population surge that would bring about social prob-
lems. By 2018, it was clear that there was not going to be a population surge. In 
2016, there were 17.86 million births registered, a 1.31 million increase; in 2017, 
that number decreased to 17.23 million, a decrease of 630,000. Expert predictions 
didn’t line up with reality. The reason is that they did not understand demographics, 
like the population of women of childbearing age, and had no access to accurate 
numbers. 
The problem is not a lack of statistics but a lack of comprehensive statistics. First, 
China is still undergoing a period of rapid urbanization; population ﬂows between 
urban and rural areas introduces uncertainty into statistics. Second, there are multiple 
government departments and agencies involved in population management; depart-
ments for family planning, public security, civil administration all collect their own 
statistics. Having individualized data suits their own needs, but there is also no stan-
dardized cooperation or sharing. The ﬁnal result is that one hand does not know what 
the other is doing. There is no attempt to bring statistics together. A city mayor, for 
example, can’t get comprehensive numbers that agree with each other. They have to 
decide between an average value or making policies that can apply across a range of 
numbers.
2 This is the number as of the end of 2017, not including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, from 
the National Bureau of Statistics’ People’s Republic of China 2017 National Economic and Social 
Development Bulletin. (2018, February 28).

Fig. 7.1 Real-time dynamic enclosure for the ﬂoating population 
The statistical problem is especially true for the ﬂoating population. If a person 
suddenly appears in a city, how can they be taken into account? This is a longstanding 
problem for city managers. Zhou Kehua, the fugitive murderer we met in previous 
chapters exploited these loopholes. He moved from city to city, continually commit-
ting offenses, only to be caught because of an error. Obviously, these cities could not 
issue prompt warnings. Zhou Kehua was a hardened criminal and was attempting to 
avoid detection, but what if we were talking about an ordinary person? Could they be 
found any easier? I don’t think any municipality or government department would 
be capable of it, given the current level of social management (Fig. 7.1). 
In the future, management of the ﬂoating population will be as easy as drawing a circle on 
the map. Mobile and network signals will immediately give the population number to urban 
management. 
One day, mobile technology will make it possible. 
In November, 2016, Nanjing’s Xuanwu District created the ﬁrst QR code house 
numbers. Don’t underestimate that tiny square of blocks. It’s perfect for a new age of 
data and networking. Anyone can scan the house number with their mobile phone. 
Ordinary people can get basic information about the house, as well as contact 
information for local police, which allows for leaving messages, interactions, and 
online application for residence permits. 
If you are the owner of the property, scanning the QR allows notiﬁcation of 
authorities of renters or tenants. 
If a municipality employee or local police ofﬁcer scans the code, they can interact 
with a platform with personal registration, ﬁre code, disaster prevention, and urban 
management information (Figs. 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4). 
In May of 2017, a social governance information platform was ofﬁcially launched in 
Nanjing’s Xuanwu district. 
An important idea in population management is “deﬁne the person by their 
dwelling,” so that people, registration, and dwelling can be clearly deﬁned and corre-
spond one-to-one. Suzhou, Jiangsu’s attempts to do this have been quite outstanding 
and effective. On a mobile phone screen, people, registration, and dwelling all 
correspond (Figs. 7.5 and 7.6).

Staff with mobile terminals can quickly call up and verify buildings in a residential 
compound, as well as population. Demographic data is also displayed, divided between 
the ﬂoating population, the permanent resident population, and particular populations that 
local administrators want to keep an eye on. 
Management through mobile devices improves the accuracy of population data, 
whether seen in short- or long-term. Rather than ﬁlling out tables in an ofﬁce, workers 
are free to travel around the community. If you have a mobile phone, you can scan 
the QR code on a house number and get access to a population database. Various 
departments can access the same database and work collaboratively on social gover-
nance. For example, the community management of Xuanwu and the public security

management have set up a clear division on responsibility for maintaining the popu-
lation database. Both sides can serve as checks and balances on each other. If they 
ﬁnd inconsistencies, social workers can send out notices to the public security depart-
ment, who can verify and correct it. Data can be modiﬁed and supplemented in real 
time.
QR codes are widespread in commercial applications, but this is the ﬁrst use of 
them in population management. I believe it to be of great signiﬁcance. It upgrades a 
house number from a multi-digit number to a public service gateway that allows for 
collaborative mobile data management. This is a new strategy to solve a millennia-old 
problem in managing population mobility. Given enough time, the quality of China’s 
population data can be massively improved and perhaps even perfected (Fig. 7.7). 
Nanjing’s QR code system has been gradually adopted in other localities. In 
January of 2017, provincial authorities in Fujian ordered all jurisdictions to establish 
common standards to promote QR code house numbers.3 Guangzhou, Dongguan, 
Jinan, and other centers have also begun using the QR code house number system. 
Having an accurate basic population database lays the foundation for compre-
hensive social management. Using QR codes to manage the ﬂoating population is a 
world-class innovation. 
When it comes to basic data collection, China has made many similar advance-
ments, but there are still some outstanding issues to solve, such as data authen-
ticity. Like population numbers, corporate data is another basic national requirement. 
However, if we look at data on corporations, it becomes clear that most municipal-
ities have no idea even how many enterprises operate within their jurisdiction. The 
reasons for this discrepancy are the same as those with population data: multiple

departments maintain their own separate records, data is not uniform, and there is a 
high rate of omission in data collection. The biggest problem, though, is the immense 
scale of publicly available data that is completely fake. 
Differentiating real data from false is the greatest challenge China faces in the 
ﬁeld of local data collection. Building a data set with inauthentic information is like 
attempting construction with rotten lumber—eventually the frame starts to buckle, 
the bridge begins to crack. 
We have one example in social security, which, according to current policy, compa-
nies must pay based on employee wages, and which is deducted by a government 
department based on wage information. Individual employees are responsible for 
about 10% of their salaries, while companies are responsible for 28%. I will use 
Zhejiang as an example: looking at labor market conditions, it is unlikely that many 
people are earning wages at the monthly minimum wage of 2819 yuan, but, according 
to what companies are reporting, as many as 90% of workers are making just that. 
The reason is simple. The higher the wages reported, the more the employee and 
the company have to pay. It’s better to report as little as possible. Although it’s also 
funded by individual and corporate contributions, companies will often report higher 
incomes to the department in charge of the housing allowance, since that money is 
not taxable and can be readily withdrawn and spent. 
This is what leads to two government departments having data sets that don’t 
agree with each other.

168

New Data Governance: Building a Modern …
Of course, if these data sets were compared to each other, discrepancies would 
immediately appear. The department in charge of social security is not ignorant of 
this, even if they pretend to be. When they receive data from other departments, they 
take pains to avoid any analysis that would show these discrepancies. Crunching the 
numbers would be an immense task and, given the unreliability of data across the 
board, potentially impossible. So, they play the ostrich, burying their head in the 
sand, pretending not to notice the problems. 
Compared to other countries, social security contributions might be a few points 
higher in China, but the mechanism by which it gets deducted is different. Foreign 
countries deduct social security based on dynamic, real-time wage information, but 
that adds in a new risk: if there was dynamic determination of contributions, many 
small- and medium-sized enterprises might not be able to handle it, leading them to 
close up shop. 
The basic ﬁgures for the social security departments, as well as the proportion of 
contributions is the responsibility of the central government. The problems we have 
discussed here show that it is difﬁcult to get authentic corporate data. Fake data is 
worse than having no data at all. Fake data cannot give us correct solutions and it 
can add to the problems faced. In the long run, trying to make policy with fake data 
is not worth the effort. 
7.3 
Networking Data: Holistic Governance in the Data 
Sphere 
Issues with population management and fake corporate ﬁnancial data shows us the 
importance of authentic, integrated information. 
The 1990s was when the Internet took off, and the 2000s was when we saw the 
Internet of Things (IoT) begin to emerge from it. The idea was that not only would 
people be connected, but so would devices. At a certain point, when everything is 
connected, we get the so-called Internet of Everything (IoE). 
As I see it, in the future, whether we are talking about people connecting to each 
other online, or devices linked through IoT or IoE, the ﬁnal form will be the Internet 
of Data (IoD). 
As I said in previous chapters, every person and object becomes a single point 
of information in the data space, with organized, structured, textured data behind it. 
Borrowing from the logic and concepts of IoE, this data point becomes a networked 
entity, or, a “data presence.” 
In other words, every person and object can be deﬁned in data. Data is not every-
thing, but everything can be converted into data. A networked node is a data pres-
ence; a data presence will have a large amount of primary data to deﬁne it but also 
integrated metadata; and each data presence will have its own unique data pattern. 
Through networking, an individual data presence can begin to be linked to other 
presences.

7.3 Networking Data: Holistic Governance in the Data Sphere
169
Digression: As in the old saying that carriages should have wheels of the same 
size, data should be standardized. 
Metadata is “data about data”; it’s the “foundation of the foundation” of big 
data. This is not the content of the data but how the data is introduced and 
explained. This can only be realized through standardization. A good example 
of this is the explanatory information on food and drug packaging. That 
explanatory information represents metadata. 
According to this standard, much of what we call data could more accurately be 
termedmetadata.Takeaphonecallasanexample:thecontentoftheconversation 
on the call is data, but the time the call was placed, its duration, the physical 
location of the two callers, etc. are metadata. Metadata is a bridge that connects 
data. Therefore, it must have a uniﬁed standard. That means that for any data 
resource, there should be only one item of metadata to correspond to it. 
When metadata is standardized, data can be integrated. This is why I have used 
theoldsayingaboutcarriagewheelsandtracksacrossanationbeingofauniform 
size. The standardization of data will have the same historical signiﬁcance as that 
measure or the idea of standardized written language. Standardization of data is 
not merely a slogan but a movement. 
To be linked is to have a relationship. The discovery of links between pieces of 
data on a network will one day be automated. With a large amount of metadata, a 
data presence will be able to automatically discover its possible relationships to other 
presences on a network. These relationships, once formed, will also be automatically 
deﬁned and stored. When a piece of data in a data presence is updated, the change 
will be pushed to other presences on the network, updating synchronously. In other 
words, there will be mutual, interactive updating of data, like a butterﬂy effect. 
With networked data, the relationships between digital presences can not only be 
automatically established and maintained, but, when the metadata is updated, they 
can be automatically deﬁned, updated, or deleted. 
In other words, future data networking will create a dynamic, intelligent web that 
stores a large amount of intersectional information. When an individual data presence 
changes, other presences will check whether or not the changes are “trustworthy”: if 
it’s deemed reliable, other presences will update their data; if it’s deemed unreliable, 
there will be no change to other data presences and the change to the original presence 
will also be rejected. The ﬁnal result is that changes will be reconciled or rejected 
simultaneously, but many numbers along the chain of data will remain unanimous 
in their decision. This is the principle of the “distributed ledger” that forms the basis 
of the blockchain. 
The purpose of this kind of conformity in network data is not simply to form 
relationships but is intended to allow simultaneous interaction and sharing between 
data presences.

New Data Governance: Building a Modern …
The private and public sectors present their own particular challenges for 
networking data. In the private sector, there is decentralization and it’s difﬁcult to 
balance a wide range of competing interests. Factoring in disputes over privacy and 
data ownership, it becomes increasingly difﬁcult to network data across ﬁrms. In 
the public sector, the main actor is the central government, which can give orders 
to subnational governments. There are still barriers within government, but they can 
be overcome. The heads of governments at the provincial and city level can send a 
message to jurisdictions below them, emphasizing that data belongs to the highest 
level of government, rather than particular departments, and it must be completely 
and unconditionally integrated. 
The conditions are there within the public sector for the networking of data. I 
believe that they will take an early lead over private sector competitors. 
The networking of data is a method; the ﬁnal form is holistic governance of the 
data dimension. 
Let me give you an example from policing: investigators often need to know if 
someone involved in a case is married and whether or not they have any property 
registered under their name, but this information is held by bureaus in charge of 
civil affairs and real estate, respectively, rather than public security organs. This 
information is always changing. If the person being investigated registered their 
marriage a day before and bought an apartment a week prior, the information has 
not trickled down to police databases. The current process has the Public Security 
Bureau putting in a data request to the relevant bureaus, which will locate and verify 
information before sending it over. In less developed regions, this process relies on 
countless phone calls. 
I predict that data networking will at least double the efﬁciency of work at multiple 
levels of government. Those improvements in efﬁciency will be seen not only at the 
level of internal management but also in the provision of services to the public. 
After data networking within the government and building holistic governance of 
the data space, this kind of situation will no longer exist. Data will be synchronized 
and shared to the police in real time. I worked in the government and military for 
ten years, so I have personal experience of data sharing issues among departments. 
Oftentimes, work in government departments comes to a halt while waiting for data. 
Employees will make use of friendships to speed up data exchange. 
I arrived back in Hangzhou from Silicon Valley on the eve of Spring Festival in 
2015 and went to the Yuhang District government’s municipal service center to start 
water, power, and gas service at the place I was renting. The main hall was spacious 
and bright; it conveniently concentrated all the services anyone would need; and 
residents and workers met in an open setting, with information laid out on a desk 
accessible to both. 
The hardware was modern, reﬂecting progress in the country over recent years, 
but I realized it was lacking software to support it. 
I went to the ﬁrst desk to get water arranged. The staff member checked my 
documents and then said that I needed to make a copy for their records. I went to the 
copy room, lined up, paid my fee, and made the copies. After ﬁnishing at the water 
desk, I looked around for the power desk and found that it was right beside me. There

7.3 Networking Data: Holistic Governance in the Data Sphere
171
was nobody else waiting, so I immediately shifted over. I never expected the young 
woman at the desk to cheerfully request a copy of my documents for their records. 
Even though the two desks were right beside each other, they were isolated in 
their tasks. I conducted a survey and found that it’s normal for municipal service 
centers to operate this way: different departments are concentrated in a single space 
but do not communicate with each other. 
If data about various utilities were networked together, it would mean being able 
to submit documents only once; also, by concentrating services at a single point, they 
could have avoided the problem of a group of people lining up at one desk, while 
another sat empty; and, more importantly, networking data for different utilities 
would improve the level of social governance and guide scientiﬁc decision-making 
on policy. 
While I was planning the City Brain project in Suzhou Industrial Park, the city 
was trying to integrate provision of water, power, and gas utilities. When they began 
carrying out tests, they came across one house that was connected to and using utilities 
despite having no registered occupants and local social workers ﬁnding nobody living 
there. That led to another local department in charge of community management to 
carry out further checks that led to the arrest of two wanted criminals. Another 
issue was found in a particular housing complex that showed a household with two 
registered occupants was using utilities at a far higher rate than expected. When the 
police investigated, they found that the place was being rented out to unregistered 
foreigners. After penalties were levied against the foreign residents, hundreds of 
other foreigners took the initiative to register with the police.4 
The networking of utilities data is only one example, but it’s proof that the central 
government’s efforts to integrate information will see many more innovative appli-
cations. One of the most valuable applications I have seen over the past few years is 
in the realm of credit: using public data, the government can create a credit platform 
that will rival Alibaba’s Sesame Credit (Fig. 7.8). 
When it comes to applying big data, there are two proﬁtable paths for the private 
sector: one is in precision marketing and the other is credit evaluation. We have 
already discussed precision marketing, where Chinese companies are keeping pace 
with American ﬁrms. In credit evaluation, China is still lagging far behind. In 1837, 
the United States established its ﬁrst credit rating agencies and 92% of the adult 
population of the country has a credit history. In China, only 33% of the population 
is connected to the personal credit system of the Bank of China.5 
4 This case is drawn from the Suzhou Development Zone Public Security Exploratory Symposium, 
August 27, 2017. 
5 This is according to statistics in the China Banking Association’s Blue Book on China’s Financial 
Industry Development. As of August 2017, the Bank of China’s personal credit information system 
included 930 million individuals, with credit information on 460 of them. As of the end of 2017, 
the total population of Mainland China was 1.39 billion. Based on these numbers, 33.1% of the 
total population has credit records.

I have already talked about the operating mechanism of Sesame Credit, which 
uses a big data, but it must be pointed out that the government also has an immense 
trove of data, which includes not only basic individual information but also informa-
tion on education, taxation, medical care, social insurance, medical insurance, and 
public transportation. With this data source, the government could evaluate and score 
citizens’ credit, just like Alibaba. 
Nanjing has carried out successful experiments in this ﬁeld. While planning their 
smart city project, they integrated data from multiple departments and developed a 
citizen credit evaluation model, then with the cooperation of the Bank of Nanjing, the 
city launched the Nanjing E-Loan program, providing consumer loans to citizens, 
through My Nanjing.6 
This is a benchmark in value-added government data projects. Integrating data 
across departments is not only to realize the goal of lifelong recordkeeping for lifelong 
management—but also lifelong service (Fig. 7.9). 
With a sufﬁcient level of data networking, any level of government can easily and 
readily create their own version of Sesame Credit to serve citizens. 
Nanjing E-Loan has a lot of potential as a promotional tool. Limitations to the 
credit management system can restrict the development of China’s commercial civi-
lization. We are entering an era in which data is credit and credit is data. In today’s 
China, personal data is more abundant than in any previous age. This gives us the 
opportunity to build a glorious and magniﬁcent civilization.

information and services. It’s an outstanding example of a city government app.

Digression: Why building a credit system might allow “overtaking on the 
inside”. 
If the foundation of human credit in Chinese tradition is human emotion 
and relationships, then the foundation of credit in a modern society is data. 
More than a century ago, when the United States began constructing its credit 
system, the cost of collecting data was very high, there wasn’t a lot of it, and 
it mainly concentrated on household assets, loan payments, credit card over-
drafts, utilities, lawsuits and liens, and other aspects, which introduced their 
own limitations. It was hard to see the “big picture” of an individual. 
Big data records all aspects of an individual’s personal and work life, so it’s 
able to go beyond the “big picture” to a “3D portrait.” A person’s worth is 
determined by countless deﬁned behaviors; individual behaviors set a person’s 
position in the credit system. China’s credit system might be able to be built 
even quicker and cheaper, due to the supply of data. Its multi-dimensional data 
evaluation capabilities will be more reﬁned and accurate than traditional credit 
evaluation methods. That’s why I say that the Internet, big data, and AI will 
allow China’s credit system to overtake on the inside. 
For “holistic data and holistic governance,” the data is already mature and the 
framework is clear. Whether or not it’s carried out, the fact remains that the data is 
there. It’s an institutional rather than technical issue. Why do I say that the issue is

174
7
New Data Governance: Building a Modern …
institutional? I predict that once data is fully networked there will be clashes between 
existing departments over it, possibly leading to serious crises. 
Dividing and handing over data is tantamount to handing over power. The 
networking of data will lead to the reorganization of the functions and processes 
of government agencies. Many government departments will be merged and others 
will simply be phased out. This is in keeping with the required administrative reform. 
Building holistic governance in the data space will necessitate a new round of reforms. 
2018 marked the 40th anniversary of China’s Reform and Opening. 40 years of 
outstanding achievements, 40 years of striding forward with conﬁdence, facing a 
new tide, and now we must set out again on a new road. The road to a better society 
is always under construction. We need to set our eyes on the distant horizon and go 
there. In the physical world, our vision may be blocked by tall buildings, fog, dust, 
and maybe even air pollution, but in the data world, the only obstruction is data that 
remains outside the network.

City Brain: Our Own Era’s Equivalent of Building 
the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge 
In 2017, I spent most of the year commuting between Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and 
Hangzhou. As I rushed between these cities—the most developed in the country—by 
road and rail, I often thought to myself, as the ﬁrst generation builders of big data, 
what did we want to leave behind for future generations? 
I often glimpsed the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge from a distance. Before 
its construction was completed in 1968, the Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai–Nanjing 
railway lines were cut in half by the Yangtze. When the train reached the river, passen-
gers had to disembark and board ferries. The poet Zhu Ziqing wrote the acclaimed 
essay called “Retreating Figure” about his experience bidding farewell to his father 
at Pukou, the city across the river from Nanjing. 
2018 marks the 50th anniversary of the bridge’s completion—a half century 
soaking up wind and rain, the ﬁrst great bridge designed and built by the Chinese 
people themselves. The bridge once served as a totem. It was the epitome and symbol 
of Chinese modernization. Pictures of the bridge appeared in newspapers and text 
books and on stamps and photo album covers, capturing the spirit of the age. 
A line about the bridge goes: “A span crossing the gap from south to north/Natural 
barriers are turned into thoroughfares.” I went to see it one night and watched it 
towering in the twilight. It was just as majestic as ever, but, just like Zhu Ziqing 
remembered his father’s departing silhouette that day, it seemed to be growing old. 
I couldn’t help but reﬂect on the past. 
The United States has its own epoch-making bridge—Golden Gate Bridge in 
San Francisco. It’s a symbol of the country and has appeared in many Hollywood 
movies. The Golden Gate Bridge is 2.7 km long, took four years to build, and cost 
$35 million. It was built in 1937, making it a miracle project for a country mired in

the Great Depression. It inspired a generation of Americans. When I was working in 
Silicon Valley, I would often go out to walk its span. Set against the sky and sea, the 
orange steel was even more dazzling. Neither strong ocean winds nor ocean currents 
nor earthquakes had shaken it. 
History is long; the ocean is vast. Bridges were once a symbol of mankind’s 
dominion over nature, but in a new age, big data and AI will replace them, washing 
away the old urban order. Regardless of the times we are living in, people will be 
called upon to build bridges and pave roads—that is, to point out a clear direction 
forward. The question we need to answer is, what big data project could have as 
great a social impact as the Yangtze River Bridge? 
As we discussed in a previous chapter, the Internet is now entering its autumn, 
and data is entering autumn, too. The application of big data has ﬂourished. It’s 
now carried out with a high degree of proﬁciency. We have precision marketing, for 
example, and personalized recommendation algorithms, individualized pricing, data 
credit, virtual currency… These are all key examples of the use of big data technology. 
They have opened the door to the market and spawned many great changes in a new 
commercial civilization. 
Even still, these are universal applications meant for commercial use, available in 
many countries, and not particularly novel. Even as they push commercial civilization 
forward, they show a less beautiful side to the average person that comes in contact 
with them, and they create their own social problems. These big data projects can’t 
be compared to the Yangtze River Bridge, which was planned at a national level for 
the well-being and safety of the masses. 
If we are really looking for a New Yangtze River Bridge in the realm of big data, 
I believe it must be the City Brain advocated by Wang Jian, Chairman of the Alibaba 
Group Technical Committee. 
The idea of an urban brain is not new but Chinese experiments have endowed it 
with a new meaning. We have taken the idea to new heights. When cities emerged 
in the Industrial Age, people began to consider the idea of them being capable of 
thought; the urban brain idea began to appear simultaneously across many countries 
in the twentieth century. In the 1930s, as skyscrapers started to be built, many people 
started to talk about these clusters of massive structures as an urban brain. 
Le Corbusier said this: 
From its ofﬁces come the commands that put the world in order. In fact, the skyscrapers are 
the brain of the City, the brain of the whole country. They embody the work of elaboration 
and command on which all activities depend. Everything is concentrated there: the tools 
that conquer time and space—telephones, telegraphs, radios; the bankins, trading houses, 
the organs of decision for the factories: ﬁnance, technology, commerce.7 
When management software systems, along with centralized databases, and 
command centers, people thought that was the form that the urban brain would take. 
In 2012, Song Junde of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications pointed 
out that, from the perspective of technology, a smart city had to bring incorporate 
intelligence into every aspect, and these aspects should be systematized under one

Fig. 7.11 Correspondence and analogy between city brain and Human brain 
“system of systems,” a central core capable of issuing commands, the brain of the 
city (Fig. 7.10).8 
The earliest discussions in Chinese of the urban brain concept on CNKI can be traced back to 
2001 and a lengthy paper about IT construction in Nanhai, Guangdong. The author imagines 
a future “digital city” whose nervous system will be a “network of ﬁber optic cables” carrying 
all manner of information to its brain, which would be a central supercomputer.9 Nanhai 
was the ﬁrst county-level city in China to get online and was a pioneer in government IT. 
(These results only include articles and newspaper reports, not online documents.) 
I think Song Junde’s understanding of the urban brain concept in 2012 was fairly 
accurate. It is a “system of systems,” after all, but technology is advancing so rapidly 
that this deﬁnition is no longer sufﬁcient to cover everything the term now connotes. 
I believe that the urban brain is something closer to networked data + AI 
(Fig. 7.11).

According to researchers in bionics, we can use the structure of the human brain to inspire 
the construction of the urban brain; the urban brain can also stimulate the cognitive functions 
of the human brain. In the cerebral cortex, neurons with speciﬁc physiological function are 
grouped in nerve centers. There are many nerve centers in the human brain, performing 
their individual functions, but also working together and interacting with each other. The 
management of the city should also be divided and coordinated in the same way. Nerve centers 
correspond to departments of urban management within the government. These centers have 
many connections to other centers, just as urban departments must also be interconnected. 
Connections are made through the exchange and sharing of data. Despite this, a simple one-
to-one comparison of AI and the human nervous system is too mechanical and implausible, 
as we have already discussed. 
Let me give you an example. In August of 2017, a social worker in Shaoxing, 
Zhejiang discovered a group of young people had killed some eels, squeezed their 
blood into a water bottle, and discarded the meat. He was upset and recorded the scene. 
The video was uploaded to the crowd-sourced public security Qunfangyun app. A 
few days later, a local policeman saw the images and thought back to a few incidents 
he had heard of involving people faking car accidents to claim compensation. These 
photos of the eel got him thinking. He ﬁgured out that perhaps these people were using 
the eel blood to fake their injuries after claiming to be hit by cars. He investigated 
further and apprehended the gang. 
Cracking this case relied on connecting human and machine intelligence. We 
could say it happened mostly by chance. Today’s cities are generating a tremendous 
amount of data, which the human brain cannot effectively analyze and process. This 
is a fundamental contradiction that all cities will need to face in an era of big data. 
Big data is a mountain of situational information and records. But if we collect it 
without the ability to analyze and judge it, we have no brain and no nervous system. 
Many of our cities today are at the stage of having a nervous system but without 
a brain. The ability of cities to analyze and exploit data is very limited. The data 
dividend for cities is still budding. 
Returning to the case of eel blood and fake trafﬁc accidents, we can see that cities 
generate data that is unrelated. The metadata on the eel photos and the reports of 
the fake trafﬁc accidents might both contain the keyword “blood,” but to link these 
seemingly unrelated pieces of data across the Internet requires human analysis, even 
if they do pass through AI algorithms (Fig. 7.12). 
With an urban brain, we may ﬁnd other surprising links between pieces of unre-
lated data, like in the famous story about Walmart discovering the connection between 
beer and diaper sales. An urban brain can turn accidents into explicable incidents 
and help city managers build a society where nothing is left to chance. 
The process that humanity has undertaken over the past half century began with 
individuals, corporations, and other organizations as their units of analysis, but we 
have entered a new stage, where the city is the unit. The future of urban management 
will use the ﬂow of data as the foundation for analysis, discovery, and planning. I 
have called this “management by data.”10

New Data Governance: Building a Modern …
Fig. 7.12 City brain will Usher in a new era of human-machine collaboration for city management 
What do I mean by the ﬂow of data? Data is like an invisible electrical current, 
connecting different systems, software, and nodes. A city has the ability to record 
commercial transactions, the location and trajectory of vehicles and individuals. That 
information can then go into the cloud. This is what I mean by the ﬂow of data. The 
ability of a city to use the data ﬂow for urban governance will become an impor-
tant indicator of its level of modernization. With data ﬂow, real-time analysis and 
prediction will allow rapid problem solving, guide managers, avert crises, accurately 
allocate public resources, and optimize all decision making. We will be able to control 
logistics, as well as the ﬂow of people, vehicles, and currency. This is the advanced, 
AI-ready form of our present day urban command centers. 
This is modern governance. 
The urban brain is not meant to replace human intelligence, nor is it capable. As I 
have already stated, artiﬁcial intelligence is not smarter than we are but simply more 
capable. Analyzing and grading massive amounts of data, for example, is beyond the 
abilities of the human brain—but not the urban brain. The analysis of AI systems can 
compensate for the blind spots in traditional city management. The speed at which 
it provides information and solutions will also be a boon. This is the advanced, 
AI-ready form of our present day urban command centers. 
I believe that the urban brain will one day become standard in all cities in the world. 
It will be a new type of urban infrastructure. City management will be upgraded 
to a new age of human–machine collaboration. Both the 18th and 19th National 
Congresses of the Chinese Communist Party had proposals to “promote the modern-
ization of the national governance system and its capabilities.” From a technical point 
of view, the best way to modernize city management is by networking data and the 
urban brain system. More importantly, the urban brain concept is new, meaning that 
China and the United States both started from the same position. At the moment, 
China is already taking a lead and will have the opportunity to become a global 
standard bearer in the ﬁeld.

7.5 One Time Only: How to Upgrade the System of “One Visit at Most”
179
Currently, only a few cities in China have proposed urban brain projects. Owing to 
the presence of Alibaba in Hangzhou, the municipality has made signiﬁcant progress 
in smart city projects. But people in the industry know that the Hangzhou City 
Brain system is limited to administering trafﬁc. Rather than an urban brain, it’s more 
of a “trafﬁc nerve center.” Suzhou, Zhuhai, Hefei, Qingdao, and Macau have also 
proposed urban brains, but they are still in the exploratory stage. We are a long way 
off from realizing holistic urban governance through AI. 
From the beginning of surveys in 1956 to trafﬁc running over the span in 1968, 
construction on the Yangtze River Bridge lasted 12 years and required 500,000 tons of 
cement and a million tons of steel. The urban brain cannot be built overnight, either. 
It will take 5–10 years of hard work to realize the modernization of the national 
governance system, but those efforts are urgent and key. 
7.5 
One Time Only: How to Upgrade the System of “One 
Visit at Most” 
The idea of “one visit at most” originated in Zhejiang in 2016 to refer to the simpli-
ﬁcation of the process for individuals and companies making applications to the 
government. The idea was that when materials were complete and there were no 
legal issues, that it would require only one trip to a government department. 
After a year of hard work on the project in Zhejiang, it began to show remarkable 
results. 
I live in Hangzhou and I often saw positive mentions of it on my social media feed. 
Figures from January of 2018 showed that 87.9% of applications were completed 
with a single trip, with a 94.7% satisfaction rate.11 
The program of “one visit at most” has become a “gold-lettered sign board,” 
announcing Zhejiang’s reforms. Many other provinces are studying the program. In 
2017, Shandong set “one visit at most” as their goal. 
In Shandong 36,000 items for application were moved into categories of “no 
additional work required” or “one visit at most.”12 Nanjing went a step further, with 
its government service center moving to send postage paid materials to the applicant 
by courier. 
In March of 2018, even Premier Li Keqiang mentioned “one visit at most” in a 
report.13 We must pay tribute to the reforms in Zhejiang, but should they stop there? 
Is there room to further deepen reform and improve on “one visit at most”? 
I think there is. The potential is huge. 
The direction must be toward one time only—a single visit for a lifetime. I think 
that if we achieve holistic data and holistic governance through a foundation of

networking, 99% of all public services will be provided online. For most people, the 
situation will be not “one visit at most” but “no visits at all.” 
This is a matter of great signiﬁcance, since reducing the number of citizens running 
errands at government ofﬁces will improve public services. It will also have an impact 
on administrative efﬁciency, document management, logistics, and other areas. 
Firstly, the government should move the provision of public services to mobile 
devices. Applications should be made online. If I had to be speciﬁc, I think the 
basic level should be 99% of services carried out with one contact online. Currently, 
many parts of the country are moving toward Internet Plus government services and 
various departments are promoting online interaction. The problem is that they often 
do things according to their own rules. For example, a citizen might register one day 
to be connected to a public security application, but then be required a short time 
later to register on a separate healthcare application. Each time, the application has 
to be downloaded and an identity registered and veriﬁed. 
Coordinating all windows on public services and their procedures according to 
the foundation of holistic data and holistic governance is of vital importance, which 
will be done through providing each citizen with a complete digital identity to carry 
things out through: download once, register once, and then you can access any public 
services or utilities. 
Secondly, one of the main reasons that people have to go to government ofﬁces is 
to hand over documents and materials, so it’s fundamental that we start reducing the 
amount of these. My suggestion is this: if somebody submits materials once, they 
don’t need to do it again! 
When data is networked, materials submitted by a citizen can be used by the 
necessary department and then accessed by other departments when they need it. 
The ﬁrst department’s audit of a document can serve as authentication for a limited 
amount of time, which will allow other departments to use it with conﬁdence. In 
this way, citizens will submit fewer documents and materials to the government over 
their lifetime and be able to take care of certain applications without submitting any 
documents. 
The meaning of “one time only” for citizens is that the government is uniﬁed: when 
dealing with different departments, they will not be asked for the same information. 
In other words, if a citizen submits their address or the names of family members to 
the one government department, for example, then other departments do not need to 
request the same data. 
With this program, no government department or agency will need to repeatedly 
request information that is already in government databases. Citizens will only need 
to provide standard information once, which will be shared internally, freeing them 
of the burden of submitting it multiple times. 
Implementing an “only once” program will mobilize the internal force of govern-
ment and the external force of society to promote holistic digital governance. The 
government is capable of ordering that multiple departments not store their own 
copies of the same data, but keep it on a networked database that any department can 
access. This means that departments will be forced to communicate between each 
other, improving the efﬁciency of provision of services. This is a mechanism to force 
change.

7.5 One Time Only: How to Upgrade the System of “One Visit at Most”
181
Using this forced mechanism has proven to be the most effective way to promote 
reform. 
Digital governance must be holistic governance. 
This requires that each department must consider the government as a whole when 
planning IT projects. Now, many local governments have realized a system of uniﬁed 
planning, establishment, and review of projects, but these processes take place at the 
level of the project itself, proving their necessity and feasibility. I believe the process 
should be expanded as soon as possible to include data. Review processes should 
include what data is collected, so as to avoid duplication in multiple departments. 
Repeated collection of the same data wastes administrative resources but because 
duplication can lead to conﬂicts in processing. If these issues remain, it will make 
networking data a very difﬁcult task. 
The duplication of data also increases the risk of it being leaked. We can see the 
danger of this in the Xu Yuyu case. In 2016, the young woman died of cardiac arrest, 
her health negatively impacted by the experience of being defrauded out of money she 
had saved for her college tuition. In applications for scholarships, she had submitted 
26 pieces of personal information that were then leaked into the hands of fraudsters. 
She died the summer she received an acceptance letter for school (Fig. 7.13). 
Left: Under the current system, the same items are repeatedly submitted to different 
departments. 
Right: When data is networked and we achieve holistic data and holistic governance, citizens 
need only submit materials one time, after which it can be shared between departments. 
Of course, there is a danger with the sharing of data between departments: this new 
level of transparency within the government might lead to staff leaking data, with data 
sharing making it harder to pin down the culprit. To solve this problem, blockchain 
technology should be used to encrypt data and record any access, modiﬁcations, or 
queries. With data stored on the blockchain, all of these processes can be traced and

audited. This will be an important step in introducing the blockchain to the public 
sector.
7.6 
Open Surveillance: The Future of Skynet 
In a previous chapter, we talked about the importance of Skynet to social governance 
and the rapid expansion of video surveillance around the world. These cameras 
transform the physical world into structured image data, which accelerates the 
development of AI. 
With fog computing, the surveillance camera is not capable of merely recording 
events but can also process and analyze the data it collects. The size and capabilities 
of these cameras turn them into something like an intelligent speck of dust. Over the 
next decade, these smart cameras will become the front line of AI technology devel-
opments. In short, cameras will get better and they will be more plentiful. Surveillance 
cameras will become an increasingly indispensable piece of urban infrastructure. 
The November of 2017 child abuse incidents across China give us some idea of 
the importance of surveillance. Incidents at a daycare run by travel agency Ctrip in 
Shanghai and an operation called Red Yellow Blue in Beijing involved allegations of 
teachers beating children, injecting them with hypodermic needles, and force feeding 
them drugs. These allegations stirred up public opinion. In the incidents in Shanghai 
and Beijing, there was surveillance footage of abuse. At the daycare operation in 
Beijing, however, the footage was corrupted by a hard disk failure. 
These two sensational incidents caused a chain reaction. Parents at a kindergarten 
in Shanxi requested surveillance footage of their own kids, but the school refused, 
saying that they needed to ﬁle a formal application. In the opinion of educators, 
the request for the video was tantamount to calling into question their reputation. 
Teachers vowed to resign if requests for open access were granted.14 
The Shanxi kindergarten was not a rare case. In fact, there were similar 
controversies and contentions at schools across the country. 
The fundamental reason is that we have no rules or clear precedents in China to 
follow on the opening up of surveillance. But we already have a massive surveillance 
network and much of it was established with public funds. Apart from the authorities 
installing cameras, like police forces, schools, or subway operators, who has the right 
to view them? Should everyone be able to view them? This is a question that the 
creators of the surveillance network should have been prepared from the beginning 
to answer. 
In the United States, the UK, Canada, and other countries, the law clearly states 
that people whose data is held by the state or its agencies have the right to access it.15

People have the right to know which agencies have data about them and to request 
or make copies.16 This type of data obviously includes surveillance data. 
Digression: How American and British citizens obtain surveillance data. 
Different countries have different thresholds for obtaining surveillance data. In 
Manchester in the UK, the rule is that people can obtain footage or photographs 
if they submit identity documents and specify the location of a camera and the 
time and date of a recording. The University of Southern California has a rule 
that they can provide footage in cases where these conditions are met: the victim 
of a crime requests video, the legal representative of a victim requests video, 
an insurance company involved in a case requests video, video is requested to 
prove personal injury or damage to property. The school also has the right to 
refuse the request if it endangers the safety of witnesses to a crime, it might 
obstruct an investigation, or the video contains materials that the department 
is legally unable to release.17 
In China, the right of individuals to access surveillance footage from public areas 
is still rarely covered by national and local regulations. Only a few jurisdictions in 
China have made rules about individuals getting access to data after approval from 
public security ofﬁcials. In Jilin, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang, the rules are that 
individuals can access surveillance data in cases where public security ofﬁcials have 
veriﬁed the necessity. However, there are no clear guidelines on applying for that 
data, how public security ofﬁcials should go about conﬁrming and providing data, 
or the time limit for handing over data.18 
These simplistic, broad regulations are difﬁcult to manage and cannot meet an 
increasingly complex social need. 
Other jurisdictions have done better in formulating regulations promoting more 
open access to surveillance. In August of 2016, Guangzhou’s municipal legal depart-
ment issued a proposal for a revised “Rules for Public Security Video Surveillance,” 
which included the following: 
In cases of infringement on the personal, property, or other rights of an individual, or in 
emergency cases, citizens may view relevant materials from the public security surveillance

regulations.

system, but they do not maintain the right to copy or modify the materials. Units with access to 
the materials must give their enthusiastic cooperation after conﬁrming identity documents.19 
People have the right to view surveillance footage in extreme situations, but no 
right to copy them. It’s unclear how this regulation will be carried out. As of the 
publication of this book, the regulations are still in the draft stage and have not been 
ofﬁcially implemented. 
In 2015, Nanjing began preparing “Administrative Measures for Sharing and 
Access of Public Information Resources,” but it has not yet been implemented, 
either. Nanjing, however, has taken great steps to increase the openness of public 
surveillance data. 
Nanjing’s innovations rest on QR codes. In the city’s Xuanwu District, a QR code 
is afﬁxed in areas covered by surveillance cameras. If citizens scan the code, they 
can access the contact information for the agency in charge of them. In the summer 
of 2017, when I was taking part in Nanjing’s smart city project, I heard from the 
police about the legend of the “Chinese Auntie.” 
On April 6th, 2017, Auntie Li of Nanjing discovered that her electric scooter, 
parked around #288 Changjiang Lu, had been stolen. She went and scanned the QR 
code to access contact information for the surveillance camera operator. She rode 
her bike to the ofﬁce and watched the video. She found the footage of a man pushing 
away her scooter. She snapped a screenshot and uploaded it to a local police app.20 
After reporting the case, two weeks went by before the police arrested a suspect 
surnamed Wang (Fig. 7.14). 
Left: After citizens scan the QR code, they can access contact information for the operator. 
Right: Surveillance image of a man stealing Auntie Li’s scooter. 
It’s important to know that a local police station might only have ten or so ofﬁcers 
covering a territory of hundreds of thousands of people. There might be dozens of 
thefts similar to the one that happened to Auntie Li. Each case requires making 
transcripts of statements, collecting evidence, visiting the scene, etc. Most people 
don’t realize how time consuming and difﬁcult it can be to investigate a case like 
this. When something like a scooter is stolen, the case is rarely cracked, unless the 
police can locate the suspect nearby. Sometimes, police arrive to investigate, see 
a surveillance camera, and then must ﬁgure out who administers it. It often takes 
several phone calls to retrieve surveillance footage, adding to the time and labor 
required to investigate a case. Xuanwu District now provides a way for citizens to

20 Launched in March of 2015, the Xuanwu Police application was developed independently by 
the Xuanwu District branch of the Nanjing Public Security for use on WeChat. It allowed users to 
report crimes and ﬁle reports, a ﬁrst for a police app in China. Citizens can report stolen or lost 
property, including ofﬁcial documents, laptops, electric scooters and their batteries, and mobile 
phones. Fraud and other cases can also be reported. After the details of their reports are veriﬁed, 
citizens can use the app to notify other users of crime. See: Lin Di. (2015, November 23). “Xuanwu

much time and effort is saved for the police! 
As I mentioned in an earlier chapter, surveillance networks have become an impor-
tant resource for police investigations. These electronic eyes are appearing in more 
and more public places. There are detractors that say these violate privacy of individ-
uals, but, looking at it from the perspective of public security, these cameras record 
data that makes criminal acts more likely to be caught and prosecuted. 
We are not only talking about crimes but other unacceptable behavior. When I was 
visiting the urban management department of one city, I heard the perfect example of 
this. Like many other cities, they outsource street cleaning to sanitation companies. 
The process is usually divided into several steps: initial spray with water, machine 
sweeping to clear debris, a more detailed sweeping to catch what might be caught in 
gutters, then a ﬁnal inspection and spot cleaning. One day, the urban management 
department saw from surveillance footage that a street cleaning vehicle was driving 
its route but its mechanical brooms were raised, so that it was not actually sweeping. 
The sanitation company that the city had contracted with was cutting corners and 
faking the job. When the urban management department shared this information with 
the department in charge of sanitation, the latter began making use of surveillance 
footage. They could use surveillance to make sure the companies they contracted 
with were doing their job. 
This is an “externality” of data.21 By that, I mean that the way data is used might 
be completely different from its original intended utility, just as we saw in the origin 
of video surveillance in watching a coffee machine to avoid making a wasted trip. In 
that case, people with access to the feed could ﬁnd out not only whether or not there 
was coffee but also who had poured the last cup. Surveillance is now so omnipresent 
that it can capture many things that it was never intended to be recording.

New Data Governance: Building a Modern …
On the evening of August 23, 2010, a college student named Ma Yue died after 
falling onto the tracks at Gulou Dajie Station. Ma Yue’s mother wanted to under-
stand the circumstances that had led to her son’s death, so she requested surveillance 
footage. The department in charge of managing the station could not prove it. Investi-
gators began looking into the surveillance system and discovered that data had been 
deleted from the hard drive due to malfunction. They found evidence of the data 
being accessed but nobody manually deleting it.22 Ma Yue’s mother embarked on a 
lengthy legal battle. In February of 2013, a court in Dongcheng District announced 
to her that they had managed to retrieve part of the video, but they restricted her 
access to it to two and a half days. They refused her requests to copy the data and 
submit it to outside experts for analysis. 
As urban management becomes more reﬁned and surveillance networks create 
more and more data, I believe that it will have to be taken out of the hands of 
public security agencies and departments. We can see in the above cases that it 
is also inappropriate for surveillance to be handed over to departments in charge 
of education or transit. An alternative appears in the form of big data departments 
that cities are beginning to set up. These departments are intended to manage urban 
data resources, which includes surveillance networks. My suggestion is that Skynet 
and related surveillance systems should be put under the administration of these 
data resource management departments. They should be kept independent of other 
departments, so that they can better serve the government and the public. 
I hope at this point in the book, you have some idea of my disposition toward 
Skynet-type networks: I support building surveillance capabilities in public spaces. 
I believe the advantages to society outweigh the disadvantages. Of course, we can’t 
deny that people walking on the street or in public parks or studying in a classroom 
have some right to privacy. With regards to privacy, I believe that data must be 
protected. Skynet should not be Big Brother but a kindly uncle, constantly watching 
over us, keeping us safe from street crime and accidents. We need to make sure that 
surveillance networks keep the truth and facts public. Individuals should have the 
right to access data that concerns their own vital interests. 
Therefore, surveillance networks need to be increasingly open. They preserve 
truth and facts. They protect the safety of people and property. They can preserve 
the dignity of the individual. Skynet takes data from citizens, so it must use that data 
in accord with their desires and needs. This is the fundamental purpose that should 
give government data collection: lifelong recordkeeping for lifelong management 
and lifelong service. 
The top priority must now be to make national-level policy on issues like appli-
cations for access to surveillance data, the use of that data by citizens, and the 
responsibilities of departments managing processes related to open surveillance. 
In addition to public surveillance cameras, Nanjing has also done its best to open 
up access to its trafﬁc cameras. In 2015, the city’s own app began including functions

These open surveillance measures are undoubtedly a welcome option for Nanjing 
residents. They deserve careful attention from cities in China and abroad. 
Who should have access to a camera? When should they have access to it? How do 
we prevent or solve the issues caused by opening up surveillance? These are difﬁcult 
questions to answer. I believe the best step might be preparing for answers to come 
later. By that, I mean, for example, when installing a new camera, its capabilities and 
performance boundaries should be clearly shown and explained. Information must be 
made clear about what the camera can record, when it records, how long data from it 
will be stored, whether or not that data is networked, who can view it, when they can 
view it, and any other relevant details. This kind of clear information will become like 
a camera’s “birth certiﬁcate.” Cameras won’t be installed without their certiﬁcate. 
A couplet from the poet Gu Cheng goes: “The dark nights gave me my dark 
eyes;/I, however, use them to look for light.” It’s the same as with atomic energy. 
The power of the atom can be used in a bomb or a power plant. The former can 
wipe out hundreds of thousands of lives in the blink of an eye, while the latter can 
produce clean energy for the beneﬁt of mankind. Surveillance networks, too, can 
harm people, but they can also shine new light on the world. 
7.7 
Regarding Modern Administration of Data 
and Algorithms 
As I have already suggested, the Internet is entering its second face and will transform 
immensely. The watch word for the next phase will be data. In the ﬁrst phase, the 
original sin of Internet companies was collecting data without consent. 
In May of 2018, the European Union introduced the strictest data regulation rules 
in history: General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is considered 
so strict because it goes right to the core issue of data property rights. Although the 
GDPR does not explicitly use that term and does not specify data rights, it implicitly 
introduces the concept. 
The GDPR introduces, for example, the “right to be forgotten.” This is a way of 
giving consumers data property rights without stating it explicitly. The right to be 
forgotten means that consumers can choose to delete data stored by a company. They 
have the right to have an Internet company “forget” them. The data that consumers 
choose to delete could be fundamental, sensitive information. This will undoubtedly 
have an impact on the quality of stored data. Data sets that have been corrupted have 
little value. This will force Internet companies to do more to show good faith and 
demonstrate the value of storing data. They will need to exchange tangible beneﬁts

7.7 Regarding Modern Administration of Data and Algorithms
189
for the privilege of preserving data. In this way, consumers can monetize their own 
data. 
Expanding AI relies on the accuracy and completeness of data sets. Without the 
right data, it is difﬁcult to develop AI. Deprived of data, AI becomes a zombie—a 
body without a soul. 
It seems likely that with the implementation of new regulations that individual 
data rights will be put into practice. At that point, the game will have new rules. The 
original model will no longer be sustainable. Internet companies will be forced to 
adapt to new boundaries and give up on tried and true methods. 
That’s the last thing that Internet companies want. They will analyze the issue 
of data rights from the perspective of efﬁciency. In their view, it’s more efﬁcient to 
allocate data rights to themselves, the companies that collect data. They believe that 
they should maintain ownership because they have to bear the costs of collecting, 
analyzing, and using data to provide services. They don’t buy into the argument 
about privacy. They don’t think fear of “data monopoly” is enough reason to take 
data rights away from Internet companies. 
This kind of thinking is very common. As we can see from Alibaba and Tencent, 
this model of data ownership can be extremely successful in building large Internet 
ﬁrms. Some observers have suggested that strict data regulations has stopped the EU 
from producing companies to rival American internet giants, like Facebook, Twitter, 
and Amazon, or China’s equivalents in Alibaba and Tencent. For them, the GDPR is 
further proof. 
As I see it, this criticism misses the mark. After nearly 30 years of wild growth, 
the regulation of the Internet is now being emphasized. When I talk about the Internet 
entering a second phase, I am also talking about the replacement of the pursuit of 
efﬁciency with the pursuit of systematized fairness and equity. To me, this seems 
inevitable. It’s no surprise that strict regulations appeared in Europe ﬁrst, given that 
it was also the birthplace of the modern property rights system and the contract. 
Our present achievements cannot be separated from the protection of property 
rights. As Mencius said, “People can only have a long-term plan after knowing their 
property is secure.” The discourse around data rights is not unexpected; this is the 
direction that the Internet is evolving in. 
Many people are not opposed to the idea of data rights for individuals but worry 
that stringent enforcement will hurt the competitive foundation of Internet ﬁrms. They 
believe that it will hurt both Internet companies and consumers. That underestimates 
the ability of the market to regenerate itself. Identifying and protecting data rights will 
have a short-term effect, but it will lead to long-term improvements in the industry. 
Protecting data rights is good for the development of the Internet. It will build a solid 
legal foundation for the development of data security and utilities. Consumers will 
no longer need to worry about security issues, which will have a positive long-term 
impact on public conﬁdence. This is a vote of conﬁdence for data technologies and 
a necessary step in building the data space. 
Whether data rights are granted to ﬁrms or individuals, this is a way of privatizing 
data. The GDPR is not valuable only because it’s forward thinking, but because of 
the compromises contained within it. Drafting these regulations required threading 
a difﬁcult path, balancing fairness, and making sacriﬁces. Compared to a plan that

190
7
New Data Governance: Building a Modern …
would prioritize efﬁciency, this shows great promise and high mindedness. From the 
perspective of our evolution as a species, we are already swimming in a data-based 
world. With its great bearing on the future direction of mankind, we must take these 
measures seriously. Big data has united mankind into a community with a shared 
destiny: “honor one and you honor all; injure one and you injure all.” Big data might 
light the way to a glorious future, but not if it sacriﬁces our rights. If we are slaves 
to rather than masters of data, big data has no future. 
These regulations spring from our fundamental desire to control data. Internet 
companies possessing a monopoly over data violates that fundamental desire. People 
want to protect their right to privacy and control their own destiny, rather than being 
shepherded by algorithms. We all hope that science and technology is being devel-
oped for the advancement of the human race, rather than to enslave us. To understand 
the move to regulate the internet, we must understand our own deep seated fear of 
big data. In essence, it is not much different from other rights movements in history. 
I predict that we will see more regulations like the GDPR in other areas of the 
world, including China. We are about to see the Internet undergo a global governance 
revolution. 
Data aside, algorithms will also face new regulations. We have already seen how 
Internet companies use algorithms and data to achieve individualized pricing, as 
well as dynamic pricing on ridesharing apps. When people use DiDi, they now have 
to contend with weather being priced into the fare, as well as surge pricing. The 
algorithm bumps up the price, but how exactly does it decide? If users balk at the 
price increase, does the algorithm know to lower it? Will it switch off the algorithm 
temporarily? DiDi has been forced to explain some of its algorithmic management 
to the public, but they don’t seem to be convinced. Consumers remain skeptical. 
Life in the city is now increasingly dependent on algorithms. They have become 
ubiquitous. Sometimes, they operate seamlessly and for our beneﬁt; other times, 
they are unfair. When algorithms work against us, they can harm the public interest, 
increase discimination. The phenomenon of “algorithmic corruption” has appeared 
in recent years, by which people game the system for their own beneﬁt. 
To return to the issue of metadata, we can say that consumers are kept in the dark 
about metadata attached to algorithms. 
Algorithms are trade secrets and they are kept closely guarded, but information 
about their basic operating mechanisms and efﬁciency should be made public. It’s 
no different from pharmaceuticals. Drug companies don’t make public how their 
products are developed, but ingredients and efﬁcacy have to be made public. If 
we take an algorithm as a virtual product, it should come with some paperwork. We 
don’t take a pill without reading directions, so why should we use algorithms without 
knowing how they work (Fig. 7.16)? 
The images above are for illustration purposes only and do not reﬂect real world uses. 
We must consider the impact of algorithms on our lives. They can even manip-
ulate our mood and psychology. I made the same comparison in the ﬁrst chapter of 
this book: an algorithm is like a drug. Before a drug is approved by regulators, the

7.7 Regarding Modern Administration of Data and Algorithms
191
Fig. 7.16 The metadata of 
algorithms should be made 
public like drug information 
manufacturer is required to deﬁne its composition, form, function, method of admin-
istration, and all possible side effects. Developers of algorithms should also have to 
lay out the elements, properties, and functions of their product. Internet companies 
should be forced to explain basic metadata, like input and output parameters. As with 
pharmaceuticals, any claims should be independently veriﬁed. 
In traditional Internet regulation, it’s content that’s censored, but in the future, it 
will be algorithms. This kind of regulation requires personal and institutional exper-
tise. I predict that many countries will move to incorporate this kind of expertise into 
government departments. In China, it could be handled by the State Administration 
for Market Regulation.

The Boundaries of Artiﬁcial Intelligence: 
Risks and the Future 
Abstract Data records the past, but it can also show us the future. If we have enough 
data, could we predict everything that is going to happen? In the age of quantum 
physics, this question has already been answered. In this chapter, I advocate the use 
of quantum thinking to examine society and propose that the uncertainty principle 
affects big data. Beyond that, we know that humans are incapable of recording 
everything, so time and space are distorted or replicated. But time and space cannot be 
perfectly replicated. The smart society has its charms, but it also has many limitations, 
weaknesses, and even great risks. 
8.1 
If Human Lives Can Be Predicted with Absolute 
Accuracy, then We Have Become Machines 
In November of 2016, Jack Ma, speaking in Shanghai, suggested that over the next 
thirty years that data would allow the expansion of the planned economy.1 
That was not the ﬁrst time that Jack Ma had applauded the planned economy. 
As early as 2015, in an interview with the Korean newspaper Joongang Ilbo, he 
claimed that by 2030, the planned economy would be the superior system. In 2017, 
he repeated his claim, saying that big data and its predictive powers would redeﬁne 
the meanings of planned economy and market economy.2 
Jack Ma’s persistence here has led to heated debate between business and 
academia. As the term suggests the past era, “planned economy” has been swept 
into the dustbin of history, while the term “market economy” remains popular. The 
return of “planned economy” to popular discourse has become a trend.3

3 In fact, Jack Ma is not the ﬁrst person to draw links between big data and the planned economy. If 
you enter the term into the Baidu search bar, you will ﬁnd that it was a hot topic ﬁve years before he 
mentioned it. In July of 2014, I was invited to speak about the issue of big data saving the planned 
economy at an event at Shanghai Jifeng Bookstore with “Nanqiao Xiansheng.”

The Boundaries of Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Risks and the Future
Surveying the past century, most economists believe that the planned economy 
was a ﬂawed system to allocate resources. But, having said that, I believe you can 
already sense what Jack Ma is getting at with his statements. The Internet at present 
is like a supernatural eye, capable of seeing into the desires of users, so what if its 
big data forecasting powers were put to use by economic planners? Why shouldn’t 
we use big data for economic planning and regulation? 
Fundamentally, all human effort is about predicting the future. If you can predict 
the future, you can control the present. In that context, how should we view the 
predictive power of big data? What can big data be used to predict? What are the 
boundaries? If it can’t be used for prediction, then what is behind its promotion? 
What are the risks and boundaries of an AI society? 
We must have a clear understanding of these issues. 
8.2 
Universal Prediction and Laplace’s Demon 
’Tis late; the astronomer in his lonely height, 
Exploring all the dark, descries from far 
Orbs that like distant isles of splendor are, 
And mornings whitening in the inﬁnite. 
Like winnowed grain the worlds go by in ﬂight, 
Or swarm in glistening spaces nebular; 
He summons one disheveled, wandering star,— 
Return ten centuries hence on such a night. 
That star will come. It dare not by one hour 
Cheat science, or falsify her calculation; 
Men will have passed, but watchful in the tower 
Man shall remain in sleepless contemplation; 
And should all men have perished there in turn, 
Truth in their stead would watch that star’s return. 
This is a poem called “The Appointment” by Nobel laureate Sully Prudhomme 
(1839–1907). In his bold, expressive, expansive verse, he is praising the unbelievable 
predictive powers of astronomers. 
The ability of mankind to predict the future was the ﬁrst breakthrough in the 
natural sciences. We know the ignorant state that our ancestors were in—unable to 
beneﬁt from their ancestors and unable to pass on their knowledge. They had no idea 
of what was coming. Human lives passed without leaving any mark. It was only with 
comparatively recent advances in science that our situation began to show a glimmer 
of hope. 
We must give credit for the establishment of modern science to Sir Isaac Newton 
(1642–1727). In his 1687 Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Newton 
proposed three laws of motion and established classical mechanics. These three laws 
meant that the motion of objects could be explained with scientiﬁc theories. What

8.2 Universal Prediction and Laplace’s Demon
195
that meant was that given the position of an object, the laws could be used to calculate 
and describe its trajectory by analyzing the environment and forces acting upon it. 
We return to trajectories again! This time, however, we are not talking about 
deriving a trajectory by looking at records but predicting a trajectory through 
calculations. 
Newton turned his gaze skyward and used the heliocentric model of Copernicus, 
Kepler, and Galileo to prove that heavenly bodies follow the same laws as those on 
Earth. The laws held on Earth and in heaven. The entire universe began to take on a 
different shape. 
What Newton did was to express the laws of nature that govern the entire natural 
world. His theories became the foundation of physics and astronomy, as well as 
modern engineering. His scientiﬁc discoveries paved the way for the First Industrial 
Revolution and the entry into the age of steam and mechanized spinning and weaving. 
Newton was given a state funeral. The poet Alexander Pope wrote this inscription 
for him: “Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night: God said, Let Newton be! and 
all was light.” 
By the end of the nineteenth century, a century on from the death of Newton, 
physics was being perfected using his theories. It was discovered that all physical 
phenomena could be described and explained through Newtonian physics and the 
electromagnetic theory of James Maxwell (1831–1879). Some people even began to 
ponder the end of science. Perhaps, they thought, all the laws of nature have been 
discovered. 
The methodology and theories of classical physics helped guide the course of 
civilizational industrialization. The core of this was objective, mechanical, precise 
methodology, which treated the world as like the workings of a clock. The parts of 
a clock are precisely mechanically connected. The trajectory of an object in space 
could be analyzed objectively. However we might view the world, it had no impact 
on  the laws of physics.  
This inspired psychologists, economists, and sociologists to attempt to decide 
that human society might also be governed by laws like those in physics. Those laws 
remained to be discovered. The goal of social scientists was to determine what laws 
might govern social phenomena. 
Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827) was a French follower of Newton. At the École 
Militaire, he had been Napoleon’s teacher and would go on to serve as Minister of 
the Interior in his government. In 1773, Laplace applied Newton’s laws of universal 
gravitation to the solar system, answering a popular scientiﬁc question of the time: 
Why is Jupiter’s orbit shrinking, while Saturn’s is constantly expanding? After that, 
he turned to social questions. In 1781, he began looking at the sex ratio of babies 
born in Paris. He used methods from classical physics to draw the probability of 
the ratio and was surprised to ﬁnd that this problem seemed to be governed by the 
same balance and symmetry of natural phenomena. He believed social and natural 
problems both had universally applicable laws. In 1814, he proposed: 
We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of 
its future. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in 
motion, and all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were

196

The Boundaries of Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Risks and the Future
also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the 
movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an 
intellect nothing would be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before 
its eyes.4 
This intellect he describes is now called Laplace’s demon. 
This is the peak of determinism. According to the theories of Newton and 
Laplace, everything, including human beings, could be governed by natural laws. 
In this way of thinking, human thought, behavior, and emotions run like clockwork, 
following a predetermined trajectory. Everything, the determinists said, was ﬁxed 
and predictable. With enough data, everything could be predicted. 
The reason given for why we can’t predict everything is that we don’t have exten-
sive enough records and sufﬁcient data. That matches up quite closely with what 
Jack Ma has claimed. 
8.3 
Quantum Thought: The Reality of Uncertainty 
In the twentieth century, scientists set their sights on the microscopic level. They 
began studying molecules, atoms, and elementary particles. But they began to 
discover more and more phenomena that couldn’t be explained by Newtonian 
physics. The ediﬁce of classical physics began to crack. At that moment, a number 
of scientists, including Einstein, Planck, Bohr, and Schrödinger, began to fearlessly 
break from tradition to create the concepts and theories that would undergird the ﬁeld 
of quantum mechanics. 
In the decades that would follow, quantum mechanics would emerge as a discipline 
key to the study of the laws of motion and particles. 
When we talk about the quantums in quantum mechanics, we are not talking about 
the particles themselves but states that they might exist in. For example, imagine the 
numerical value assigned to an object’s measurement… Let’s say these measurements 
go 1, 2, 3, 4. We can’t continue arbitrarily between 1 and 2. So, 1.11, 1.111, etc. Those 
are quantum states. The smallest unit is called a quantum. In the natural world and 
social life, there are many phenomena that can be measured but when we attempt 
to record those results, we observe consistent and inconsistent results. For example, 
an accelerating car will not jump immediately from 0 km per hour to 100. There is 
a gradual acceleration from 0 to 100, which means that there will be a consistent 
state of change. Another example, this time from social science: when conducting a 
census, it is only possible to use a single individual as the smallest unit, so there will 
be no results like “1.23 people.” That kind of inconsistent change is quantization. 
You can understand it like this: when you get down to the smallest, indivisible 
elementary particles, its state cannot be determined by mankind.

The German physicist Max Planck (1858–1947) was the ﬁrst to hypothesize that a 
particle’s energy could not be measured continuously, like a classical wave. In addi-
tion to this, Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) later proposed the uncertainty principle. 
He believed that microscopic phenomena could not be observed or measured without 
adding interference. In any attempt to carry out observation and measurement of a 
particle, the act of observing has an effect. This interference will make it hard to make 
key determinations. In other words, the observer themselves change the results of 
any observation, recording, or measurement. Therefore, quantum theory holds that 
microscopic particles can jump between spaces without consistent motion. Even if 
we have all available information and data, we cannot predict the motion and orien-
tation of a particle. In attempting to make better measurements for our forecast, we 
change the behavior of the particle. Here, we have an essential disagreement with 
the idea of Laplace’s demon. 
In order to deal with uncertainty in measuring the motion of particles, quantum 
mechanics gives us the idea of probability. There is no way to be sure of the position 
or state of a particle. All we can do is use an equation to assess the probability of an 
electron’s position, t, at a certain time, r. 
The most important characteristics of classical physics are that the conclusions are 
objective, mechanical, precise, all summed up in the deterministic idea of Laplace’s 
demon. Quantum theory combines the subjective world and the microscopic world. 
The two are inseparable. What we observe about the microscopic world must be 
perceived, measured, and recorded, but, by doing that, we distort things. At the 
microscopic level, the world is uncertain. Take for example Schrödinger’s cat. Until 
we open the lid, the cat in the box must be considered simultaneously alive and dead. 
Nothing is certain. 
This is quite similar to observations at a more human level. As we saw in previous 
chapters, a historian picking up a brush or a journalist pointing a camera will change 
the language and behavior of the imperial sovereign or the president. Nixon’s chief 
of staff admitted that he spoke differently when he knew the tape was running. His 
ideas were being distorted by the knowledge of being recorded. People that know 
they are being observed and recorded will modify their behavior, even if they are not 
aware of it. That makes it difﬁcult to predict their next action or plot their trajectory. 
Just like elementary particles, human beings are hard to record and observe with 
certainty. By observing life, we change what we are observing. Economics, sociology, 
and philosophy have all been inﬂuenced by ideas from quantum theory.

Human Being Are the City’s Uncertain Elementary 
Particle 
We need to better understand the city, the place where most of us live. Everyone 
understands the city—but they don’t. Sometimes, when my plane is coming in for a 
landing, this strange feeling comes to me with amazing clarity.

The Boundaries of Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Risks and the Future
The ﬁrst thing you notice as the plane approaches a city is the border between 
urban and rural areas. Roads cut across the land; the land is covered with farms, 
houses, water, and mud. As the plane gets lower, you notice highways, apartment 
blocks, interchanges; the land changes from dirt to concrete. At that moment, you 
realize clearly that the city is an artiﬁcially constructed environment. It must follow 
geographical features, but it’s otherwise a human creation. We lay steel, glass, and 
concrete across the surface of the Earth, so that the city appears like a protrusion on 
its surface. 
The plane gradually descends and speeds over the surface of the Earth. The tallest 
buildings look no bigger than matchboxes. The highways and the vehicles on them 
look like toys. The city looks like a sandbox. But you might ﬁnd yourself surprised 
when landing to realize that it has the capacity to feed, clothe, house, entertain, 
infuriate, gladden, and sadden millions of people. The city is like a giant container 
for human life. We design it, we control it, and we try to create a safe, stable, 
comfortable, prosperous life within it. 
The city is the greatest transformation that the human species has carried out on the 
planet. We live within it and also participate in its ongoing design and transformation. 
In the sixteenth century, before artillery made them obsolete, major cities invariably 
had walls. At that time, cities were even more like sealed containers of life. 
Containing people within the city is the greatest transformation that mankind 
brought to the natural world. As I discussed in a previous chapter, human civilization 
comes from records, but, other than records, we must also take into account that 
the place where civilization concentrates is in the city. Words and data can record 
thoughts, but cities are where they can take form. 
From agricultural to industrial society, and then on to the information society, we 
have continued to design, cultivate, control, and cleanse. By planning new systems 
and regulations and inventing equipment and facilities, we are trying to grow the 
ideal garden within our sealed containers. 
Take individual members of society as the elementary particles in the gigantic 
structure of the city, constantly in motion… Our task is to study these particles. 
We must ﬁnd a way to portray and express their behavioral choices, and also their 
trajectories through space and time. 
In the previous chapter on the urban brain as the new Yangtze River Bridge, we 
saw that one new contradiction of our current system is that too much data is being 
generated. There is no way to harness enough manpower to deal with them. We 
need new plans. This data represents many different types of information, including 
administrative information for the government, demographic surveys, consumer and 
social information from the Internet, surveillance footage, etc. This is a ﬂood of data, 
but no matter how it is networked, it lacks consistently and is disconnected. Like the 
elementary particles at the quantum level, the data jumps around. Data records one 
fact but must be thought of as a fragment. 
I believe these fragments of data are comparable to quanta. For example, data from 
a surveillance camera is not showing us continuous information: a vehicle driving 
through the city is captured on cameras at various positions, which is converted into 
data, which creates a trajectory based on inference. If a vehicle appeared on Camera

8.4 Human Being Are the City’s Uncertain Elementary Particle
199
A at 10:00 and Camera B at 10:30, the trajectory can be estimated, but not with 
certainty, since there will be multiple routes between Camera A and Camera B. We 
don’t know if the driver might have had a small issue that caused him to deviate from 
his course. Maybe they took a shortcut that we couldn’t predict. 
Even with Skynet and City Brain, the data being analyzed lacks internal consis-
tency and continuity. Just like electrons or neutrons, we can’t make any statements 
with absolute deﬁnitiveness but rather statements of probability. 
Imagine a pool table. The cue strikes a ball. Newtonian mechanics can calculate 
the trajectory. It can also calculate what will happen with the next two or three balls 
that are struck. But as complexity increases, calculations are increasingly difﬁcult to 
make with accuracy. Now, imagine that we have a table capable of holding millions of 
balls… Once these balls are set in motion, this pool table is as complex as the shallow 
container of the urban environment. At the microscopic level, the motion of these 
balls is chaotic, just like people moving through the city. If we look at the system as 
a whole, we can start to see some patterns emerge. Only in rare circumstances are 
those ﬂuctuations particularly large. 
An urban management team does not need to know the trajectory of every one of 
these particles. If we return to the pool table analogy, they would only need to know 
general ideas, like when a ball went into a pocket, hit a certain point on a bumper, 
which balls it collided with, etc. With that information, trajectories can be plotted. 
For locations outside of those about which speciﬁc information exists, probabilities 
can be calculated. 
This is how data is now collected, used, and analyzed for urban management. 
The trajectory of people through the city is as difﬁcult to measure as the motion of 
elementary particles. As we have already seen, cameras and tape recorders change a 
person’s behavior. But there are other ways to change behavior through data collection 
and information dissemination. We have an example in the trafﬁc advisory boards 
now installed on roads. They are color-coded: red indicates congestion at a certain 
stretch of the road or intersection, yellow is busy, and green is light trafﬁc. You might 
choose to take the road highlighted in green, but you’ll quickly notice that the trafﬁc 
is picking up. Why would that be? Many other drivers will have noticed the trafﬁc 
advisory and made a similar decision. 
We can take the stock market as an example, too. At any moment, there are many 
people buying stocks, but imagine that an individual buyer has been granted the 
ability to predict the future price of a stock. If this individual knows the stock price is 
going to shoot up, he will buy a large number of shares. The problem is that his large 
purchase will not go unnoticed. He will affect the market. Individuals, the elementary 
particle of this particle marketplace analogy, will change their behaviors. They might 
decide to buy or sell in large quantities. The entire stock market will be inﬂuenced by 
the purchase of the ﬁrst prophetic buyer, inﬂuencing the trend. But if the prophetic 
buyer knows the stock is expected to shoot up and does nothing, his powers are for 
nothing. 
This is the pitfall of trying to predict human behavior. If we can predict a result, it 
will change the outcome. No matter how accurate, once we try to act on the prediction, 
we ﬁnd it impossible to actually do anything.

The Boundaries of Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Risks and the Future
There is an ancient fable in India about a Brahman priest attempting to disprove 
the Buddha’s predictions. He took a sparrow, clutched it in his hand, and draped a 
long sleeve to hide it. He asked the Buddha whether the bird was alive or dead. If 
the Buddha said the bird was dead, the Brahman priest could take it out and prove 
him wrong. If the Buddha said the bird was alive, the Brahman priest could pinch its 
neck with his ﬁngers, then take it out and show a dead bird. The Buddha declined 
to answer. He walked slowly to the threshold of the temple gate, paused, and asked, 
“Am I going in or going out?”. 
The Brahman priest could never give a correct answer. As soon as he made his 
prediction, the Buddha could do the opposite. If he kept his prediction to himself, he 
has a 50–50 chance of getting it right, which is no better than taking a random guess. 
Human beings have free will. They are particles whose state cannot be predicted. 
We can never make accurate predictions about human futures because somebody 
will invariably come along and do the opposite. The prediction itself will change 
the behavior of the person whose behavior it attempts to forecast. For this reason, 
individual behavior cannot be predicted. When we are talking about groups, though, 
it becomes more feasible. Individuals have free will but they are balanced out within 
a group. That is why it’s hard to predict the price of a single stock but much easier 
to predict general market trends (Fig. 8.1). 
General predictions can be made, but only in situations where the target of the fore-
cast is unaware of their behavior being recorded, observed, and estimated. The target 
must be completely undisturbed. This is almost impossible because maintaining 
records and gathering data is itself a type of interference. 
Apart from this fundamental problem of predicting human behavior, there is also 
the limitation of collecting data. The knowledge granted the ideal intellect proposed 
by Laplace is not possible to gather about an individual. This means that it is almost 
impossible to make predictions about social and economic affairs with any degree 
of accuracy.

Data Relativity: The Limits of Universal Recording 
The source of data is recording. 
Records have no boundaries. As Su Shi writes in The Red Cliff : “Only the cool 
wind on the river, or the full moon in the mountains, caught by the ear becomes a 
sound, or met by the eye changes to color; no one forbids me to make it mine, no 
limit is set to the use of it…” The meaning of this is that there is no limit to the 
things that we can record. Even if we wanted to, we would never run out of things 
to capture. 
There is no limit to what can be recorded, but there is a limit to our capacity 
to record. We must admit that there are still many things that we are incapable of 
recording. 
American novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804–1864) has an interesting story that 
shows us the limits of records. It also has lessons about what we would face if we 
did break those limits.5 
David Swan is a handsome young man on his way to Boston. While waiting for 
the coach, his exhaustion overcomes him and he falls asleep under a tree. 
After sleeping for a while, a wealthy husband and wife encounter him. Their 
carriage has broken down. They have recently lost a son and have nobody to inherit 
their fortune. When they see David, they are taken with him. He has an infectious 
allure. They note that he is young and healthy. They want to get to know him. They 
decide they could pass their wealth on to him. 
They say that it’s as if God laid him in their path. But just as they’re about to wake 
him up, someone rushes up to tell them that the carriage has been repaired and they 
can get back on the road. They are shaken from their reverie and realize the absurdity 
of passing on their inheritance to a stranger. 
After their carriage leaves, a young woman arrives. When she sees the sleeping 
young man, she has the feeling of having stumbled into his bedroom. She blushes 
with embarrassment. She lingers for a while and shoos away some insects. It turns 
out that she’s the daughter of a wealthy businessman and he is looking for a man like 
David to wed her to. If woke up at that moment, his future would change completely, 
but he kept sleeping. She watches him for a while, breathing heavily, her face ﬂushed 
red. Eventually, she, too, moves on. 
Next come two bandits. They look covetously at the bundle under David’s head. 
As they’re taking out knives, a big dog runs up and starts barking. They don’t want 
the owner of the dog to discover them, so they put their knives away and walk off as 
casually as possible. 
“In a few hours they had forgotten the whole affair,” Hawthorne writes of the 
bandits, “nor once imagined that the recording angel had written down the crime of 
murder against their souls, in letters as durable as eternity.” A short time later, David 
wakes up. In a short period of time, he had come so close to wealth, love, and death, 
without even realizing it. He gets on the carriage to Boston and his life returns to its 
regular trajectory.
5 I am talking about Hawthorne’s 1837 novel, David Swan.

The Boundaries of Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Risks and the Future
If there was a record, everything would change. David could disembark from his 
carriage in Boston and ﬁnd the wealthy couple that needed an heir, or track down the 
woman that seemed to have fallen in love with him, or bring the bandits to justice… 
But when our eyes close, we lose our insight into the world around us. And even if 
we do have our eyes open, it’s difﬁcult to know the true thoughts of other people. 
The psychological world is still a space that we can’t penetrate with records. But 
novelists can unwind emotions, speculate, and depict the inner world of characters. 
Literature can allow for incredible things. 
It’s because of this ability to depict what can’t be recorded that literature has 
developed the way it has. The core of literature is human nature. It’s difﬁcult to shine 
a light into the darkness of the human soul. It is as vast and profound as the starry sky. 
But literature can show us human nature. That’s a unique characteristic of literature 
that sets it apart from science. 
When parts of human nature become recordable, they can be incorporated into 
science, reducing the foothold of literature. This is also the reason why universal 
recording can change human nature. 
If we could record everything and gain insight into it, our spirits would be over-
whelmed. As Hawthorne says in the novel, if his protagonist could see all the possible 
routes his life could take, he would be ﬁlled with conﬂicting emotions. This also 
shows us that the lives of individuals are unpredictable. 
So, is it better to record truth and facts and know what’s going on, or should 
we avoid it? Transparency and happiness are not necessarily linked. It’s hard to say 
whether or not it’s better to be a prophet or a fool. This is the place where human 
nature and the world are entangled. If we truly understood the amount unrecordable 
in our human world, it would shake our faith in data. 
There are things that simply cannot be recorded; there are also limitations to the 
extent to which other things can be recorded. As soon as data is generated, it begins 
to fragment. Data is like shards of a broken window pane. It is always incomplete 
and discontinuous. Data can only record a single fact or several facets of the same 
fact. No matter how the record is made, data can never reproduce the whole. 
Twelve years ago, when I arrived in the United States as a graduate student, my 
professor repeated a famous line: “Everyone can have their own opinions, but they 
can’t have their own facts.” We must differentiate opinions from facts. From that day 
forward, I took the quote as a standard. 
Even so, I have learned from experience that the reason why consensus is so hard 
to reach is because so many people do have their own facts. There might be only one 
objective truth, but there are countless interpretations. When people look at an event 
or issue, they see only one side of it. It’s rare for someone to have a complete or even 
multifaceted understanding. So, everyone does have their own facts. 
That demonstrates a huge risk in our present time: collecting a large amount of 
data will lead to “everyone’s voice count; everyone has their own understanding.” I 
mean that if a person wants to come to a certain conclusion, they will be able to ﬁnd 
data to support it, even if it’s an opinion that’s divergent from the mainstream. No 
matter how much data we possess, we still may not be able to arrive at a complete 
understanding.

8.5 Data Relativity: The Limits of Universal Recording
203
The data might come close to the truth, but even as it does, it never fully represents 
the truth. 
If there is a God, then only He can see the complete picture. We can’t come close. 
No matter how much data we have, we simply can’t do it. 
Leaving aside the issue of fragmentation, there are other reasons why our records 
lag behind reality. In 2016, I gave a speech at an annual meeting held by computer 
storage manufacturer Seagate. On my way back to Hangzhou from Chengdu, I noticed 
a message from an attendee in my email account. It had a rather sharp question. “Mr. 
Tu,” it began, “I am a senior data analyst, but the rise in the amount of data we’re 
collecting has turned me into a skeptic. I didn’t want to raise this question at the 
meeting because I was worried how my colleagues would react…”. 
His issue was that he could see that more and more data was not bringing us any 
closer to the truth. The truth couldn’t be discovered through data. In other words, 
even if the data was accurate, it didn’t necessarily correspond to the facts. 
His clarity moved me. Data records facts but, once recorded, they immediately 
become something from the past. Recording is always in the process of attempting 
to catch up with facts. This is one of the limitations of recording. The reason is that 
the facts are constantly changing. The value of records is always relative. I call this 
the theory of data relativity. Einstein’s theory of relativity covers space–time and 
gravity, and the theory of data relativity relates to data and facts. I can’t help but 
think of the tortuous, complicated two century process that Americans went through 
to ﬁgure out the population of the country: 
People within the American government have racked their brains to ﬁgure out how many 
people actually live there. Beginning in the 1860s, successive administrations began sending 
out letters to citizens, entreating them not to conceal the number of members in their family 
from census takers. Signed by the president, these letters promised that the information 
collected would only be used to arrive at true population numbers. They vowed that numbers 
wouldn’t be used for taxation, military conscription, or court cases. Since then, presidential 
administrations have endeavored to eliminate human error from their results and ensure the 
objectivity of census data. They also did their best to speed up the census. The ﬁrst census 
took two years, which was eventually shortened to months, and then days. 
At every moment, babies are being born and people are dying. These events happen 
in homes, hospitals, and even in the wilderness. Reality does not wait for a true portrait 
to be painted. In any man made census process, there is no way to gather all these facts 
simultaneously. They can only give us a snapshot of a certain moment. 
To this day, even with the advent of the Internet and mobile phones, the problem remains 
unsolved. 
Man is the wisest of all creatures, but we are still not capable of adding up how many 
of our kind populate this planet. What about things? They are even more innumerable. A 
single red bean, a bowl of beef noodle soup, a car, an emotion, a thought… We cannot even 
imagine. It recalls the saying, “The universe exists in every ﬂower; the Buddha lives in every 
leaf.” 
The world is large and full of innumerable things. Everything is constantly in motion. In 
a moment, everything can change. Like the ancients, we are only capable of taking a decision 
without knowing every fact, only possessing a small piece of the puzzle, a small lens to peer 
through on our “small facts.” Our feelings of confusion and perplexity are natural and hard 
to overcome.

The Boundaries of Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Risks and the Future
In a complex and constantly changing world, we can only do our best. Even though 
the population numbers could never be ﬁxed, the American government kept attempting to 
improve their data collection methods, increase the efﬁciency of their programs, and try to 
get one step closer to the truth. Now, the Census Bureau has a Population Clock that can 
predict by-the-minute changes in the population. 
Like a pendulum that never stops, data is always catching up with facts. With the improve-
ment in recording technology, invoking the theory of data relativity, we have entered an era 
of improved clarity.6 
Data is the foundation of AI. It’s AI, rather than human intelligence, that will rule 
the data space. 
Since recording has limitations and data spaces have boundaries, AI must also 
have limits. To understand AI, we must know where its limits are. 
8.6 
Facial Expression Analysis: The Boundaries of AI 
In addition to playing chess, AI has three iconic applications: unmanned vehicles, 
speech recognition, and image recognition. We can see clear boundaries in each use 
case. 
Let’s look at unmanned vehicles ﬁrst. As we have seen in an earlier chapter, 
although great progress has been made over the past couple years, there is still a large 
gap between present development and universal application. The key to developing 
AI for driving will be creating the types of roads and infrastructure that allow it to 
operate. This is not the kind of job that will be completed overnight, but it will soon 
be realized in certain applications, like ﬁxed routes inside industrial ones, piloting 
street cleaning equipment in predawn hours, and short distance transit. Those are 
coming soon. 
Driverless cars will result in some drivers being made redundant but I don’t believe 
the fear of AI-driven unemployment will be durable. AI will eliminate some jobs; it 
will create new jobs. What we want to usher in is a new age of growth, just like the 
spread of machines at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. At that time, there 
was fear of machinery replacing people at their jobs, but what actually happened was 
an overall improvement in standards of living. 
In this process, we will have to pay a price, too. In an era of AI, all innovation and 
progress is driving toward giving intelligence to machines and bringing us closer to 
them. There will be many instances where we are forced to adjust our work practices, 
behaviors, and skill sets to meet the needs of machines. This is how man and machine 
will be united. At that point, we can begin to have humans and machines cooperate and 
complement each other. We can co-exist with machines. That will mean undergoing 
a degree of systematization.

Now, let’s look at speech recognition, part of the ﬁeld of machine hearing. Deep 
learning has made great progress in speech recognition and a large number of auto-
matic transcription and translation projects have been launched. According to Liu 
Qingfeng, the chairman of iFlytek, the accuracy of its transcription software has 
reached 97%. The error rate of machine hearing in the WSJ eval92 Benchmark has 
dropped to 3.1%, which is lower than the 5% human error rate. In a smaller domestic 
benchmark test, the error rate was 3.7%, while a 4% human error rate was found. 
That means that AI speech recognition has surpassed our own abilities.7 
We can see in speech recognition the convergence of human and machine intel-
ligence. There are times when we must modify our voices for the machine to better 
track them. This is an example of us being trained, or becoming more like machines. 
An analogy might be a ﬁeld being tilled by farm equipment and then beginning to 
grow in a way that makes harvesting easier for the machine. 
Apart from speech recognition, the ﬁeld of machine hearing also involves being 
able to tell a person’s emotional state through their voice, as well as speech 
synthesis, which will allow AI to speak. For sounds other than the speech, such as 
music, machine hearing has other recognitions, like recognizing melodies or chord 
progression or genre classiﬁcation. 
Finally, we turn to image recognition, which is part of the ﬁeld of machine vision. 
Out of the three, this is the sphere that deserves the most attention. As we have already 
seen, most of the information we take in about the world around us is through vision. 
There is more visual than auditory information. The success of unmanned vehicles 
will also rely heavily on machine vision and image recognition. 
As we have already discussed, the development of image recognition and espe-
cially facial recognition has great value and signiﬁcance. But facial recognition goes 
beyond simply recognizing a face. The purpose is to one day get to a point where 
emotions can be determined from the study of a face. Facial expression analysis and 
facial recognition are not the same: facial recognition involves distinguishing faces, 
while facial expression analysis is using the same technology to determine emotional 
state from facial expressions. 
It is usually said that human beings have “seven emotions and six sensory plea-
sures,“ or this is sometimes summed up in the four-character phrase, “joy-anger-
grief-happiness.” The easiest way to see human emotion is on the face. The study 
of facial expressions has become the object of study in both East and West. The 
idea of closely observing somebody’s words and expression is one part of this, as is 
physiognomy. Complete Works of Wise Advisors records this story: 
In the Spring and Autumn Period, Duke Huan of Qi discussed with Guan Zhong the matter 
of punishing the Prince of Wei. He went back to the palace. When Wei Ji saw Duke Huan of 
Qi, she went and paid obeisance, begging to be punished in place of the Prince. Duke Huan 
of Qi asked her what her reasons were. She answered: “When I saw Your Highness coming, 
you walked boldly and I could see you had the will to punish Wei. When Your Highness saw 
me, his temperament changed.” The next day, Duke Huan of Qi went back to the court and 
Guan Zhong asked him, “Have you reconsidered attacking Wei?” Duke Huan of Qi asked
7 Amodei et al. (2015). 

206
8
The Boundaries of Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Risks and the Future
how he knew. Guan Zhong replied that he had noticed that Duke Huan of Qi was walking 
tentatively and speaking slowly. When he met the minister, he seemed ashamed.8 
It’s because the people around him are so good at observing his body language 
that they can ﬁgure out what Duke Huan of Qi is thinking. This shows us the wisdom 
of traditional China. They might be thought of as disloyal ofﬁcials, but close obser-
vation of body language and currying favor and gaining knowledge through it was a 
necessary skill. Like facial recognition for AI, it requires a lot of data and complex 
calculations. Disloyal ofﬁcials could use their past experience with the sovereign to 
make judgements. They had minds that were adept at those calculations. They were 
intelligent, even if they were dishonest. 
Digression: the historical popularity of physiognomy 
Looking for patterns to decipher in facial features was the earliest form of 
facial expression analysis. As I have already mentioned, a craze for portraits 
followed the invention of photography, and following that was a rise in interest 
in studying faces. In East and West, there has been an interest since ancient 
times in the connection between the human face, individual characteristics, and 
destiny. There are many idioms in Chinese that imply this connection, like, “the 
face follows the soul,” or, “our faces are our fate.” The former suggests that 
our emotional state will be written in our appearance, and the latter suggests 
that the face reﬂects some inborn personal characteristics that will guide our 
destiny. 
Physiognomy was once broadly popular. In a 1927 murder case in the United 
States physiognomy experts were called to testify. Ruth Snyder was charged 
with attempting to kill her husband seven times and succeeding on the eighth 
attempt. The expert took measurements of Snyder’s face with calipers. He noted 
the pointed, feline character of her chin, which he said denoted a treacherous 
and ungrateful individual. Her facial features suggested had “the character of a 
shallow-brained pleasure seeker… murderous passion and lust.”9 Snyder was 
sent to the electric chair in no small part because of this testimony. 
We now know that physiognomy is pseudoscience, but that has not extinguished 
its vitality. There are still experts that claim it to be genuine. 
Like many other sciences that grew out of primitive practices, facial expression 
analysis grew out of physiognomy in the 1970s. It overlapped slightly with physiog-
nomy and the idea of studying someone’s words and expressions to learn their true 
thoughts, but it surpassed these to become a new science.

207
The founder of this new science was Paul Ekman (1934–). He and his colleagues 
spent eight years creating a reliable method to analyze facial expressions. They began 
by breaking down the anatomy and identifying 43 facial muscles. Each muscle was 
a unit of action. All facial expressions could be understood as a combination of these 
43 units. These combinations formed a facial expression code system. 
This system was made up of a database that uncluded 10,000 photographic and 
text descriptions of facial action unit combinations. Each piece of data describes 
muscles, unit combinations, and their corresponding emotions. Ekman believed that 
there were 3,000 facial expressions relevant to emotion. Those facial expressions 
were interpretable. Ekman began experimenting on himself, mobilizing every muscle 
in his face to make a particular expression. When he failed, he went to consult with 
a surgeon, who helped him use a needle to stimulate those particular muscles that 
remained uncooperative. 
This database was very effective. With it, Ekman wrote many legendary new 
chapters in the history of psychology. 
Suicides are common in psychiatric hospitals. Patients that want to kill themselves 
will often go to the doctor and report, “I’m feeling ﬁne. Can I go out for a stroll?” 
Experienced doctors know that patients will sometimes say this sincerely, but the 
second possibility is that they are looking for a chance to commit suicide. It is 
difﬁcult for doctors to make that call (Fig. 8.2). 
Ekman was once ranked among the top hundred psychologists of the twentieth century. He 
has trained tens of thousands of lie detectors across many ﬁelds. He has found that the most 
successful group was people from intelligence and special services due to their experience 
with studying facial expressions. He found that judges were often the least effective at judging 
the sincerity of someone testifying, since they sit in a place where they can’t see their faces 
and are often absorbed in notetaking or listening. Ekman’s work and practice provided the 
material for the celebrated TV series Lie to Me. 
Ekman asked the doctor to record the process of their conversation with patients. 
He then watched them repeatedly. At ﬁrst, Ekman didn’t notice any difference 
between the sincere and the suicidal patients. However, once he reviewed them

multiple times in slow motion, he could see the difference: the suicidal patients in 
expressions that lasted less than 0.07 s exhibited strong pain. These expressions were 
short but revealed the patient’s true intentions. Ekman later identiﬁed them in other 
footage. He called these “micro-expressions.” These brief expressions that ﬂashed 
across people’s faces could not be detected by untrained observers, but they revealed 
the true intentions and feelings of the subject.
Apart from those pained micro-expressions, Ekman was also able to tell from his 
system of facial expression analysis whether or not a person’s smile was genuine. A 
genuine smile is caused by spontaneous emotions. It mobilizes the muscles around 
the cheekbones and eyes that are incapable of being moved consciously. The forced 
smile, though, uses the zygomaticus major, which extends from the cheekbones to 
the corners of the mouth. Another example was the frontalis pars medalis, located 
in the area of the inner eyebrow. When slightly raised, it reveals sadness. “If you see 
this, you’ll know the person is sad even before they know it.”10 
We must remember that the foundation of Ekman’s micro-expressions was 
recording. The video footage of patients interacting with doctors was crucial material 
for Ekman’s research. He used video instead of photos because there was less chance 
of the subject striking a pose and obscuring their natural state. When researchers try 
to capture changes in facial expressions, photos are not sufﬁcient. This also illustrates 
the reason for the emergence of ﬁlm and cameras. 
In 1998, Bill Clinton was suddenly embroiled in a sex scandal involving a White 
House intern named Monica Lewinsky. At ﬁrst, Clinton denied having had sex with 
Lewinsky. Clinton claimed this: “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.” 
When Ekman saw it, he knew Clinton was lying: “One of the things people do when 
they lie is to use distancing language,” Ekman said. “We know he knew Monica. Yet 
he used the words ‘that woman.’”11 He was even capable of pointing out exactly 
which facial muscles Clinton had been using (Fig. 8.3).

Psychologists quickly determined that Clinton lied at the press conference. Psychologists 
have found that touching the nose is a sign of deception. The reason for this is that lying 
increases heart rate, which makes your nose twitch. Clinton touched his nose 26 times during 
the press conference. 
Once Ekman’s system was proven effective, there were proposals to train AI to 
make use of it. Ekman himself predicted in 2004 that his system would be usable 
by AI within ﬁve years and that there would be cameras capable of immediately 
processing micro-expressions.12 
Digression: Other uses of facial expression analysis 
Facial expression analysis has a wide range of uses beyond lie detection. In 
business negotiations, being able to interpret subtle changes in expression 
would afford a great advantage. In sales, careful observation while a customer 
inspects a product could give hints as to their true thoughts. When it comes to 
individual use, it could give people a better understanding of their own facial 
expressions, which will usually only be seen by their family and friends. Facial 
expression analysis could help people control their emotions and improve their 
communication skills. 
If machines are capable of facial expression analysis, they can begin to understand 
human emotions and thoughts. That will be a great step forward in the development 
of AI. Machines will understand something of human nature. That is an important 
way to expand the horizons of human–machine interaction. 
This might sound far fetched, but it’s quite logical. Ekman has taken the inborn 
ability of humans to read facial expressions and generated rules for them that can be 
followed by machines. With facial expressions systematized, machines can under-
stand and mimic us. In fact, AI has a great advantage over us, when it comes to 
interpreting facial expressions. As Ekman says, the micro-expression is usually too 
quick for the naked eye to perceive, but cameras have no such limitations. They can 
capture micro-expressions quickly and accurately. With that ability, it seems clear 
that AI will one day surpass the average person in being able to read faces—and might 
one day even be more accurate than the treacherous ofﬁcials in ancient records. 
Since 2010, there have been various attempts around the world, using Ekman’s 
system as their basis, to deal with the problem of AI facial expression analysis. One 
example is Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT), developed by the 
University of California, San Diego. CERT can automatically detect faces in video 
footage and simultaneously recognize thirty action unit combinations from Ekman’s 
system, including anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and contempt. A 
joint test between Carnegie-Mellon and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT) found an accuracy rate of 80.6% for CERT.13 The system could be used to

check for signs of depression, schizophrenia, autism, anxiety, and other disorders, 
but it could also be installed in a car to monitor a driver’s fatigue, or installed in an 
elderly care facility. Most people will not give voice to certain sentiments, but their 
facial expressions will always reveal their true feelings. 
In May of 2018, Hangzhou Number 11 Middle School introduced an “Intelligent 
Classroom Management System,” which scans a surveillance photo of the classroom 
every thirty seconds and identiﬁes emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, or disgust 
from facial expressions, as well as common classroom behaviors (raising hands, 
writing, standing up, listening, putting head down on desk). The system can use this 
to provide statistical analysis to teachers for classroom management. 
When the story of the Hangzhou class monitoring system made the news, it 
aroused some controversy and debate. Supporters insisted that the system would 
improve classroom order and optimize the learning experience, while opponents 
claimed that it was a violation of privacy. That violation of privacy from a young age 
would distort the behavior or students. It was not, opponents said, optimization but 
alienation. It was twisting education. 
I don’t believe this opposition is really warranted. A teacher’s attention is limited 
to a small number of students at any given moment, so they will not notice other 
kids drifting off, ﬁdgeting, or even leaving the classroom. The intelligent monitoring 
system is capable of seeing the classroom from six angles. It can ﬁll in the gaps. There 
is no question that it should be adopted for use by schools. The question, rather, is 
how exactly it should be used. 
Students can be distracted, but the machine cannot be distracted. Teachers and 
administrators have to take a relaxed attitude toward that kind of behavior. Imme-
diately scolding any student that drifts off is not acceptable. That is how you turn 
humans into robots. In the future, the solution might be this: when the system notices 
that a student is distracted, it will send a signal to their smart watch, signaling them 
with a vibration to pay attention. 
Going beyond this story, we must acknowledge that we will have to get used 
to being observed by machines. We will have to live in harmony with algorithms. 
From a young age, our children need to be aware of data force. Being surrounded by 
cameras must be no more strange than being in nature. 
Looking back over history, the Agricultural Revolution and the Industrial Revo-
lution have brought profound, liberatory change to our material lives, and the AI 
revolution taking place now will have equally signiﬁcant liberatory change. It will 
change our spiritual, cultural, and religious lives. It is not going too far to say that it 
might change human nature itself. 
Systems similar to the one in the Hangzhou classroom are being employed in 
movie theaters. The goal is to accurately gauge audience reaction. Disney designed 
a system to analyze audience facial expression: factorized variational autoencoders 
(FVAEs). They instrumented a 400 seat movie theater using four infrared cameras. 
In a completely darkened theater, the system can detect laughter, a slight smile, tears, 
and other emotional responses. By analyzing these facial expressions, Disney can 
get data on audience response to the movie and to individual scenes. This is a method 
of getting quantitative data on movies (Fig. 8.4).

This is also an example of data and AI entering the artistic sphere. We used to be 
under the impression that machines could only deal with scientiﬁc issues and that 
art was beyond their abilities. There seemed to be a clear boundary between the two 
spheres of art and science. But science has broken down that boundary. Logic and 
rules can apply to art, too. There are parts of art that can be thought of as science. 
My prediction is that facial expression analysis and emotional computing will be 
helped along by data gathered through a wider range of sensors, including wearable 
devices. Physiological data from human subjects will be collected, including facial 
expressions, speech tone, gestures, brain waves, and cardiovascular state. That will 
allow for a comprehensive analysis of a person’s emotional and physiological state. 
Machines are more capable than humans in making interpretations and predictions 
from this data. At ﬁrst, this will be restricted to laboratories. This also seems to be 
proof that an era of universal records will be accompanied by universal calculation. 
The AI is capable of using 43 different muscle combinations to recreate human 
facial expressions, while Ekman’s system includes more than 3,000 examples of 
meaningful human expressions. When we get right down to it, once rules for some-
thing are established, AI can begin to replicate it: in the future, machines will be able 
to have facial expressions, just like we do. 
At this point, we reach one of the boundaries—if we can summarize things through 
logic, rules, and data, AI can begin to approach human behavior, but there are also 
things that are not expressed according to rules. At that point, AI is powerless. 
Reading about the legendary academic exploits of Ekman is thrilling. We can 
marvel at his understanding of human psychology. It’s an amazing feat to turn facial 
expression analysis into hard science. However, when we learn that machines will 
soon possess the ability to mimic our faces, we are ﬁlled with fear and disgust. It 
sends a shiver down our spines. It’s undeniable that this future is on the horizon.

8.7 
The Smart Society Transformation 
AI is propelling us into a new social form: the smart society. In the social environment 
of the smart society, we will reach the peak of granularity, individualization, and 
integration of machine intelligence. But new crises wait around every corner. This is 
especially true at the current stage, when we have one foot in the smart society and 
our center of gravity is still in the traditional society. This is a stage of development 
that has many potential problems. Our society is like an exquisite crystal ball or a 
porcelain vase: the more delicate and sophisticated it is, the more fragile. This is the 
danger we face in entering the smart society. We must deal with the combination of 
sophistication and fragility. 
The reason for this is: in the smart society, there will be a powerful process of 
social networking. Nothing like this has happened previously in human history. This 
will also have an unprecedented effect on social governance. 
In the past, society was mechanical, inelegant, and loose. It was like a large clock. 
A clock like that is not only large and cumbersome but also tends to lose a few 
minutes a day. But the smart society will be digital and electronic. It will be driven 
by computer chips. Instead of a large clock, it will be like a massive assemblage 
of individual quartz watches. These units will cooperate with each other and make 
decisions together. These small units are far more elegant and precise than the big 
clock. They are also more ﬂexible. 
In agricultural societies, time is structured by the four seasons, harvest in autumn 
and store grain for the winter, human lives pass through all their stages… The struc-
ture of time was simple. If a hoe is broken, it can be replaced in time for planting. A 
farmer’s problems rarely spread out from the individual to the community. 
In the industrial society, machines sped up society and increased the complexity 
of its structures. A problem with a single part of a machine would cause it to grind to 
a halt. A small problem can quickly cause the paralysis of an entire system. An entire 
city could be plunged into darkness by the failure of a small component. That was 
unthinkable in the prior age of candles and lamps. In 1986, when NASA’s Challenger 
broke into pieces 73 s after launch, killing seven astronauts, the cause of the accident 
was found to be record low temperatures reducing the elasticity of rubber O-rings. 
The failure of the O-ring allowed the unexpected release of hot, high-pressure gas, 
causing an explosion. This proves that no part is truly redundant and no detail can be 
left to chance. Each country has to invest resources in the type of management that 
will prevent accidents. 
In the smart society, everything will be stitched together by software, the Internet, 
and sensors. This is a great stride forward from the foundation of industrial society. 
Compared to rockets and shuttles, the level of complexity will be even greater. Human 
error can be isolated; we can troubleshoot, repair, and improve glitches in machines or 
software; and in a society dominated by intelligent linkages, there will be no depen-
dence on a single individual or component but rather many systems of increasing 
complexity. So, in a smart network with various sensors, controls, algorithmic proto-
cols, and databases, there will be a high level of interdependence, so a problem 
within one parameter might cause a chain reaction through the system, freezing a

8.7 The Smart Society Transformation
213
large sector. Troubleshooting a problem in such a system will be difﬁcult. It would 
be a disaster if the only option was to shut down the entire system. 
There’s a simple explanation for this. Networking everything will allow the 
butterﬂy effect—a butterﬂy ﬂaps its wings in Brazil and causes a tornado in Texas— 
to be even more widespread. When we try to ﬁgure out where the tornado came from, 
it’s very difﬁcult to trace it back to the butterﬂy in Brazil. 
A more complex society means that correcting issues becomes more complicated 
and costly. 
The uneasy truth is that there will be vulnerabilities and they will appear without 
warning. It’s been 33 years since the ﬁrst Windows release in 1985 and it has 
required continuous patching and upgrading over this time. In 2015 alone, Windows 
announced 135 bugs and vulnerabilities were ﬁxed. These vulnerabilities could 
have been exploited at any time. The defense has to keep pace with the offense. 
It’s like the old saying about the shield that’s invulnerable and the spear that can 
pierce any material. All software and mobile applications are faced with this kind of 
contradiction. 
Murphy’s Law says that if anything can go wrong, it will. 
Sometimes failures can be harmless, but they can also be disastrous. On July 20th, 
2016, Southwest Airlines was crippled by a failed router. 2,300 ﬂights were canceled 
over four days, stranding thousands of passengers. Southwest’s CEO explained it 
like this in a memo: “When the router failed, the data … piled up like a freeway 
trafﬁc jam.” 
Digression: Why sensors are the key vulnerability of the smart society 
According to Juniper Research, the number of IoT devices will reach 
38.5 billion by 2020, a 285% increase over the 2015 number of 13.4 
billion.15 Networked sensor devices will be present in every corner of our world 
and become a key component of our society. These IoT devices are vulnerable 
to attack because of their limited capacity for running security software. 
In October of 2016, the American ﬁrm Dyn, which provides Domain Name 
System (DNS) services to numerous web platforms suffered a large-scale 
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. The DoS attack on DNS services took down 
services in multiple cities, causing estimated losses to web companies totaling 
hundreds of millions of dollars. The IP addresses of the machines used to 
coordinate the mass DoS attack showed that they were mostly IoT devices. In 
other words, hackers had harnessed the networking capabilities of devices as 
mundane as Internet-connected coffee machines. In 2014, hackers hijacked 
100,000 IoT devices, including fridges, routers, and smart TVs to launch 
attacks.

The Boundaries of Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Risks and the Future
There was once an incident where the Thai ﬁnance minister Suchart Jaovisidha was 
trapped in his BMW after the onboard computer malfunctioned. The air conditioner 
was switched off and the doors and windows were sealed shut. Onlookers were 
powerless to help him. Finally, a security guard from a nearby building arrived with 
a sledgehammer and broke a window. 
As the complexity and intelligence of a system grows, the possibility of fatal 
glitches actually increases. This risk shows us the fragility of society. 
Humans are prone to error, but in the smart society, the mistakes will come from 
computers and algorithms. That might be even more disastrous. My prediction is that 
we will soon realize that algorithms and networking can only expand to a certain 
point. There will soon be legislation to restrict algorithms. Our ultimate goal has to 
be ﬁnding a balance between human and algorithmic autonomy. 
We can compare our new smart society to a beautiful vase of ﬂowers. The vase 
represents its fragility and the ﬂowers represent a world of sensuality. In the future, we 
will have a world with many beautiful ﬂowers of information, entrancing our gazes. 
Mixed among them might be fake plastic ﬂowers. As machine vision and machine 
hearing improves, as well as facial expression mimicry and machine speech, it is 
more likely that these technologies will be used to spread falsehood. 
In March of 2016, the University of Nuremberg released an application called 
Face2Face, which allows for real-time face capture of a person that is then projected 
on another face. In other words, you can record yourself saying a phrase and then 
produce a video of someone else saying the same phrase in the same way. Face2Face 
is not the only program capable of this real time “facial transplant,” but it’s particularly 
accurate and realistic. The results are hard for the untrained eye to differentiate from 
real videos. 
In August of 2017, researchers at the University of Washington published a paper 
about a project that involved using a neural network and machine learning to produce 
a deep fake of Barack Obama delivering a speech. The program had analyzed millions 
of frames of video to ﬂawlessly copy Obama’s face when he spoke. It was capable of 
making Obama say things he had never said before.16 In March of 2018, iFLYTEK 
CEO Liu Qingfeng said in an interview that the dream of his company was to make 
machines speak. He claimed that they would one day be capable of imitating Trump 
so ﬂawlessly that even Americans would believe it.17 
This technology can be used to mimic the speech of any world leader, public 
ﬁgure, celebrity, or private citizen. It could be used to make a fake speech from 
Trump or Kim Jong-un. Imagine for a moment the implications of this. Even a brief 
speech about nuclear weapons negotiations or testing could have a massive impact 
on the stock market (Fig. 8.5). 
At upper left is the person providing their expressions. The software copies the expressions 
and projects them on the target object, as well as synthesizing their voice. Here, we see a 
synthetic George Bush, Jr. mimicking the expressions of the person at upper left.

When faced with these deep fakes videos, images, or audio, it is difﬁcult for even 
professionals to quickly verify them. To combat fraudulent behavior, we need to 
improve machine learning. In the future, AI might be able to detect deep fakes. They 
will be able to notice the lack of particular ﬂaws or some other characteristics that 
a real video would have. As we enter a smart society, there will be an arms race 
between fraudsters and anti-fraud agencies. 
This new arms race is concerning. When machines become capable of sensing, 
remembering, learning, analyzing, making decisions, and mimicking, they will 
quickly reach a point where they are millions of times more advanced than ourselves. 
The possibility of a negative outcome is magniﬁed. Technology is neutral; people 
with good and bad intentions will endure the outcome of technological advancement. 
Data space is virtual, but we don’t want it to be completely ﬁctional. The problem 
is that history has repeatedly proved that human nature lacks the ability to judge or 
resist change. The paradox is that only AI can protect us from AI. This is the key 
contradiction of the era. We have to charge forward. There is no going back.

Epilog: The Fourth Wave and How We 
Retake the Lead 
The year 1500 AD is regarded by many scholars as the beginning of the modern 
world. American scholar Leften Stavros Stavrianos (1913–2004) uses that year as a 
demarcation point in his A Global History because it was when the world began to 
be integrated together, including by the great age of exploration that linked Europe, 
Africa, and the Americas. 
Before this period, China had been a great power, but it began a gradual decline. 
Many reasons have been proposed for this. 
Looking back at the case of recording, I believe the main reason for China’s decline 
is that the printing press was invented in Europe. We can refer to that technology 
as the Third Wave, following the invention of writing and paper. China missed this 
wave. That is one of the remarkable things about human history: when an opportunity 
arises, those who seize it will open themselves up to more opportunity; those who 
fail to seize the opportunity will ﬁnd other opportunities closed. The latter loses their 
original advantage. This is called the Matthew effect of accumulated advantage. That 
was a problem for China until the second half of the twentieth century. 
After the invention of the printing press came the camera in the 1840s and then 
the audio recording equipment in the 1980s. We were suddenly capable of keeping 
images and reproducing sounds. These were unbelievable advances. With these new 
tools, we could expand recording from simply noting things in text. But the equip-
ment was expensive and not portable, so people had to go to specialized venues 
for photography or recording. These new technologies remained in the hands of 
professionals, at ﬁrst. 
Over the ﬁnal decade of the twentieth century, things began to change. The rise 
of the Internet allowed the unprecedented spread of recording. Information such as 
text, audio, and images began to be digitized. Apple launched their ﬁrst iPhone in 
2007 and smartphones began to appear in the palms of consumers, ushering in an 
age of universal recording. This is the Fourth Wave of recording, following paper 
and text, then the printing press. Almost everything in our lives can now be recorded. 
This data can be stored in the cloud and be passed onto future generations. 
Looking back at the sweep of history, human beings at the start of agricultural 
society made their living from the Earth and survived on what it produced, but they

had little ability to impact it. Once we entered the industrial age, we erected massive 
structures on the Earth and began remaking its shape, molding and creating new 
materials, building out of glass, steel, and cement, and creating infrastructure for 
water, electricity, and gas. The city became the center of human civilization and 
gathered the elite of our species. On the surface, we can analyze cities as a semi-
artiﬁcial entity. In the age of information, when data has become a new resource, 
linked together by the infrastructure of the Internet, we have a new bedrock to deposit 
information. Data has increased in quantity and has been further integrated. That has 
allowed us to create a new space—the data space. There is now a virtual space beyond 
the physical world. In this new space, data is like a new soil that can grow all things. 
Humanity is its master.
In other words, the data space is a completely man made world. 
We have received some blessings from this new virtual space. Compared to the 
twentieth century, the individualization of universal recording gives the individual 
new potential. The data space will allow that potential to be realized. The world will 
be rapidly transformed by this new reality. 
Today, anything we write can be uploaded and then searched, analyzed, and quanti-
ﬁed through the store of knowledge that is the Internet. If you want to ﬁnd a sentence 
similar to the one you’re reading in another book, you can do it. You can check 
whether your thinking, language, and logic is novel or not. We can now stand on the 
shoulders of giants and take genuine leaps forward. This is innovation. 
Around the Lantern Festival in 2007, I talked to a poet in Hangzhou named Wang 
Ziliang and he gave me a book of his poetry. He told me that he had always wanted 
to write a poem about cats but had avoided the topic because he felt Baudelaire had 
already mastered it in his poem called “Cats.” It got me thinking that a good poem 
is one that cannot be rewritten. The same is true of a good essay or book. If it cannot 
be replaced, it becomes the “boundary.” 
Human knowledge has boundaries but knowledge itself has no boundaries. If you 
want to be a pioneer, you must know where the boundaries lie. To move forward, 
you must know where you stand and where your predecessors have already gone. 
Innovation is easier when it proceeds from the work of people that have gone before. 
If we compare all existing knowledge created by ourselves and our predecessors 
to a circle, then at any point on the line, people may have made breakthroughs. That 
expands the circle. The limits of human knowledge can be expanded. 
Here, it must be said that most previous expansions of that circle of human knowl-
edge were made by professionals. This is because ﬁnding the limits and building on 
the advances of predecessors requires some expertise. The cost of innovation was 
formerly quite high, but the reality of data and Internet expansion, as well as real-time, 
inexpensive, and universal records, means that barriers have been lowered. People 
outside of professional spheres can now offer their own contributions to innovations. 
In the past, innovations by ordinary people existed but were rare; in the future, that 
will change. 
Now that all professions are being affected by data, we see the creation of large-
scale database records. This is not only to store data but also to integrate and optimize 
it. There are certain problems that could not be easily solved if our level of technology

had stayed at the printing press. Once a book is published, the technology of the 
printing press makes it more durable, but it cannot be updated. Information recorded 
online can be continuously read but also edited and discussed. Examples of this 
are Wikipedia articles or Dianping entries. There is a cycle that means records on 
the Internet are dynamic, constantly changing, and also linked. Finding information 
online and ﬁnding information in books is completely different. 
A large proportion of what’s recorded online are individual activities or personal 
opinions. This information can be integrated to produce a new kind of subjective 
authority—the wisdom of the crowd. 
In human history, organizations, corporations, and specialists used to take advan-
tage of the fact that certain things were unrecordable and unquantiﬁable. They could 
use this to manipulate people. But because this ability has been diminished because 
of universal recording. Now, experts are being replaced by popular consensus. This 
consensus now often takes the form of data. For example, when we shop for a product, 
we can see its sales ﬁgures, reviews, and how many people have hit the “Like” button 
on it. This can have a direct impact on our behavior as consumers. 
Data is shining a new light on our world. This light is similar to the natural light 
emitted by stars; it appears weak to us, but in fact is produced by astral bodies just as 
powerful as our own sun. The closest star to the earth is Proxima Centauri, which is 
four light years away. In other words, traveling at the speed of light, it would take four 
years to reach it. It’s more than 27,000 times further away from the Earth than our 
own sun. The only reason it seems so dim in the night sky is because of its distance. 
If we were to get close to it, we could appreciate the massive amount of energy it 
releases. The same holds true for data: it seems distant and dim, but it also holds an 
immense amount of power that we can only appreciate when we get close to it. 
In the long term, I am optimistic about the development of Chinese civilization. 
Over the past three decades, we have seized on the opportunities offered by the 
Internet for building social infrastructure. Europe might be the birthplace of the 
printing press and the Industrial Revolution, but they have failed to seize on the 
Internet revolution, just as China failed to get onboard with those earlier innovations. 
Up until the present, Europe has not produced any globally competitive Internet 
ﬁrms. Instead of seizing the opportunity, Europe has fallen behind and the glories it 
decorated itself with during previous ages have now dimmed. 
The Internet emerged in the 1990s, and in the ﬁrst year of that decade, the American 
government lifted most restrictions on its consumer use. That allowed the internet to 
go from a specialized network for military and industrial research to a commercial 
public network. Since then, innumerable companies and individuals from around 
the world have jumped in headﬁrst. China made sure that they would be part of the 
Internet—and they have even gone beyond participating, now, taking a leading role 
in some sectors. 
In 2005, the number of Internet users in China broke the hundred million mark, 
and, by 2017, that number had reached 772 million (753 million mobile users).1

Epilog: The Fourth Wave and How We Retake the Lead
Fig. A.1 The golden age of the Chinese Internet, 1993–2002 
There are ﬁve major Internet companies in the world and China produced two of 
them. China has boarded a bullet train to the Internet future. There’s no doubt that 
the country is a force to be reckoned with. 
Since the reforms of the 1980s, China’s leadership has embraced computer and 
networking technology and adopted an attitude of “develop ﬁrst and manage later.” 
For most of that period, China has not had a competent authority in charge of the 
Internet. That provided space for the Internet to develop (Fig. A.1). 
The “develop ﬁrst and manage later” approach turned out to be of great beneﬁt. 
That remains true. We have had an open mind to the Internet. In hindsight, the 
leadership sees the wisdom of that decision. In the wake of major changes in the 
ﬁeld, with the arrival of big data and AI, China’s arms remain open. 
In August of 2015, the State Council produced its “Notice of the State Council 
on Issuing the Action Outline for Promoting the Development of Big Data,” which 
included establishment of a management mechanism of “talking, decision-making, 
management and innovation based on data.” In July 2017, we saw the release of the 
“Notice of the State Council on Issuing the Development Plan on the New Genera-
tion of Artiﬁcial Intelligence.” This AI plan pointed China in the direction of taking 
initiative on adapting to technological and social changes brought about by machine 
intelligence. China does its best to take the lead in development, as it represents 
a historical opportunity. There is a three step goal for AI in China: reach parity 
with global AI development and application by 2020, begin achieving major break-
throughs and setting the pace by 2025, and turn China into a world leader and the 
center of AI innovation by 2030. 
The plan for AI in China contains many advanced, eye-catching, and unexpected 
statements, especially in the realm of human–machine intelligence, crowd-sourced 
AI, smart economy, smart governance, transmedia integration, etc. I can tell from

the plan that the Chinese government is ambitious. I am happy that our leaders 
are seizing this historic opportunity. Two centuries ago, China missed out on the 
Industrial Revolution, but we won’t make the same mistake this time. 
The world is changing quickly. Nowadays, when I take a trip, it is often by high-
speed rail. This transportation innovation has become a symbol of China. It is far 
faster than traditional trains because of advances in its drivetrain. Everytime I board a 
train, I think about comparative types of advances taking place in society (Fig. A.2). 
Over the long development of the technology, the locomotive was always given 
the role of driver of the entire length of the train. So, the speed of the train relies on the 
speed of the locomotive. The driving force was centralized and individual. But the 
weight that the locomotive was pulling limited its speed. The power of high-speed 
rail lies in the fact that all cars are providing drive. This is a distributed system. Rather 
than being dragged, the cars are driving themselves. The cars in the length of the 
train are in a state of absolute coordination. The is not only a mechanical and energy 
synergy but also an information and data collaboration. That is why high-speed rail 
can run so quickly. 
This dynamic collaboration is similar to the architecture of cloud computing 
and big data. The traditional system is that information is stored in one place; 
when a calculation needs to be made, the information is pulled from that loca-
tion. So, the computer drags a database behind it, providing the computing power. 
In the distributed cloud, the operation is similar to high-speed rail, with each node 
providing computing power. Connected to the cloud, a computer can store data, as 
well as performing computing tasks. The node provides storage and also processing 
capabilities, rather than just being a passive part of a system. 
If we look at the architecture of the blockchain, we also see a distributed system. 
After a transaction takes place, the blockchain records information at multiple links 
on the chain. Every node is capable of storing information. If we compare it to a 
company, it would be like having every employee capable of doing accounting tasks; 
everyone has access to the ledger; and they are equal in power, so they can supervise 
each other and reconcile their records with other ledgers on the blockchain. Each 
node can also act as the master node, if required.

Epilog: The Fourth Wave and How We Retake the Lead
Integrating high-speed rail, cloud computing, and blockchain technology into our 
society will lead to signiﬁcant dynamic change. 
That dynamism is why I have so much faith in the future progress of Chinese 
society. 
It seems to me that China’s leaders are acutely aware of this kind of historic change. 
In 2015, government documents began including this slogan: “mass entrepreneur-
ship and innovation initiative.” This eventually was changed to “upgraded mass 
entrepreneurship and innovation initiative,” reﬂecting the widening of the goals to 
activate hundreds of millions of people in the promotion of the nation’s development. 
Looking at it another way, we could recall the distributed systems of cloud computing 
and high-speed rail, and see that the same logic might be applied to the people of the 
nation itself. 
As I write this, China’s Reform and Opening is entering its 41st year. In the past, 
that policy was driven by the state and elite actors, but now it requires all citizens 
to participate. The development of any country requires a sustainable driving force, 
and we must draw from every citizen. 
Technology is empowering the individual. Our civilization is turning the page 
on a new chapter in its development. That will require shifting from state-driven to 
citizen-driven progress. This mechanism is the most fundamental guarantee of China 
continuing to ﬂourish and remain as a world leader. If we can continue to develop 
by this means, we can usher in a new era. A country with a big population and big 
data is sure to have a bright future.

Afterword: Setting Out on the Rugged Trail 
From Which No Man Has Yet Returned 
This is my third book on the same topic, following Big Data and The Peaks of Data. 
I tried making some changes from those works. 
The ﬁrst change was the perspective. The ﬁrst two books were written while I was 
in the United States and are more about looking at China from the outside world. By 
the time I started work on this book, I had been back in China for three years and had 
gotten some experience as a corporate executive here. This book is my reﬂection on 
current trends in development and reform from within the country. 
The second change was that after spending eight years mostly reading English 
works on the topic, I started re-reading some Chinese-language works, especially 
the classics. I hoped to gain inspiration from traditional Chinese wisdom. Since I am 
writing in Chinese, I thought it wise to also try to introduce some ancient Chinese 
wisdom. These works can offer solutions to problems of modern times. 
One example is my writing on quantum mechanics. I was struck by two poems 
by Tao Yuanming. I was struck by the image he uses of human life being like dust. 
He goes on to say that the gust of wind itself gives form to the formless. The basic 
meaning is that life is like particles scattered in the air. Our bodies take on different 
forms through hardship, so we ﬁnally end up as something else. This inspired me 
to conceive of modern people as the elementary particles of the city. There is no 
reason not to apply quantum physics to urban problems, since people can be just as 
unpredictable as particles. 
Another example is incorporating notes on ancient Chinese painters into my 
chapter on facial recognition. The Western Jin Dynasty scholar Fu Xian (239–294) 
wrote speciﬁcally on the issue of portraits and neatly summed up why aristocrats 
demanded pictures of themselves: they wanted to leave a lasting legacy. They didn’t 
want to be forgotten by future generations. The earliest portraits came from the same 
place as modern portraiture, which is recording. The same holds true for East and 
West. 
The need to record things is part of human nature. 
The third change I introduced in this book is that it is more focused on the future. It 
attempts to answer questions on the cutting edge of technology. Due to the arrival of 
deep learning, artiﬁcial intelligence has made leaps and strides in the past ﬁve years,

but what is coming next in AI? Deep learning uses data as a way to develop AI, so 
what would happen if the machines could begin to digest books? Would that allow 
them to have more human intelligence? Another issue to consider is errors. Human 
drivers will have trafﬁc accidents and human doctors will misdiagnose illnesses, but 
what about machines? What are the limits of machine intelligence? Humans also 
have the ability to process tacit, unspoken information that cannot be systematized 
or clearly put into words. That is why doctors are considered more knowledgeable as 
they age. They acquire and accumulate wisdom with age and experience. There are 
things they know that might be hard to pass on to future generations. So, the question 
arises, will there be a new form of civilization beyond what we see around us now?
While algorithms and AI have made great progress in approximating human intel-
ligence, human existence is moving closer to machine life. In the 1930s, Charlie 
Chaplin’s Modern Times gave us an image of an alienated assembly line worker 
screwing in screws all day. What most people don’t realize is that people using their 
smartphones are also in the same predicament. The modern phone is also like working 
on an assembly line, just like all software. This assembly line remains hidden in the 
cloud. The alienation of industrial society was conﬁned to factory workers, but the 
alienation of the data society is universal. Today, no matter where we ﬁnd ourselves, 
the assembly line beckons, but instead of screwing in screws, we are scrolling and 
tapping. 
I agree with Marvin Minsky that most humans are machines most of the time. So, 
AI is certainly capable of matching our average intelligence. In fact, it will likely 
surpass it soon. 
But can AI be put to any good use by ordinary people? Would implanting chips 
in our brains allow us to quickly retrieve stored information and spit out facts like a 
robot? What I mean by this is, will we join the machines in surpassing our present 
average intelligence? Will the answer be in augmenting our intelligence? Could this 
work? Could this enhance human creativity? 
I also tried to look at the issue of algorithms and their power to integrate data. 
The spread of algorithms reduces the random chance inherent in human society. 
That serves to make life more efﬁcient, but not necessarily better. The integration of 
data provides more opportunities to stitch society together, but there are still many 
loopholes. In the end, will a smart society be fragile or durable? 
These are the sorts of questions that emerge at the outer limits of human 
knowledge. I have attempted to answer some of them. 
Many nights, I paced back and forth in my ofﬁce or sat in front of my computer, 
trying to get the basic logic or facts of my arguments correct. During these times, a 
poem by Li Yu of the Southern Tang dynasty would come to mind. He wrote: “I see 
snow on the distant mountains/Leading to them, a rugged trail from which no man 
has yet returned.” 
The poem describes a man wandering alone up into snowy mountains. In these 
lines, we get the sense of a man that is alone and powerless to resist the call of the 
trail. While writing this book, I had the revelation that the ancient loner would be 
today’s startup guy. The powerlessness to resist the rugged trail that he describes 
might be the reaction that drove him to innovation. In fact, the urge to create new

Afterword: Setting Out on the Rugged Trail From Which No Man Has …
225
solutions is the same as the urge to go into the mountains. We don’t know what might 
be found there. The loner will climb with his bare hands up those sheer cliffs and 
keep going until he reaches territory where no man has been before. Most people 
could not bear that feeling. Human nature would push us to quickly retreat. Most 
people would turn back halfway. 
But I also know that it is unimportant to press ahead too far. As long as someone 
can expand the limits of human knowledge a small amount, he has still contributed 
to human civilization. That is how it has always gone. 
Attempting to answer these questions at the edge of human knowledge is also an 
innovation. That is what was on my mind while writing this book. 
My inspiration was this: in actual practice, innovators must be good at using words 
and actions to break through the boundaries of human knowledge. 
I also felt that the answers for some questions could not be found in science, logic, 
criticism, or precise arguments; they could be found, however, in sociology, literature, 
and ancient wisdom. If most modern Chinese-language books on this topic give no 
answers, perhaps we need to go back to the thinkers of an earlier time. Science and 
technology are reshaping the world, but human nature remains the same. Looking 
at technological modernization, too much emphasis is given to a multiplicity of 
opinions, so that is why I have gone back to ancient Chinese thought. 
I faced a difﬁculty with this book that I did not face with my previous two books: I 
was writing after leaving my position at Alibaba and trying to piece together hours to 
work in the midst of starting a data technology consulting ﬁrm. Just like a computer, 
the human brain has to be warmed up, too, and I sometimes found that the warmup 
time was longer than the time I had to write. I often felt guilty about trying to split 
my time between the book and my business, worrying that I wasn’t devoting enough 
time to either. 
This book was only completed with the support of my family and friends. Before 
anyone, I would like to thank my wife for her understanding and my children 
for their faith. Secondly, I would like to thank Secretary Chen Gang of Xiong’an 
New Area, Director Chen Jianhua of Guangzhou Municipal People’s Congress, and 
Deputy Director Mao Guanglie of the Standing Committee of the Zhejiang People’s 
Congress, who have paid close attention to the development of big data technology 
in China and offered their support to my research and encouragement for my work. 
I would also like to thank Director Shen Jianrong and Deputy Director He Jun of 
the Nanjing Development and Reform Commission and Director Xu Wenqing and 
Director Duan Qingyi of Suzhou Industrial Park. In 2017, I took part in smart city 
and urban brain projects in both areas, which gave me the opportunity to get real 
world experience in these highly developed cities. Many cases cited in this book 
come from my experience and research in Nanjing and Suzhou. 
I would also like to say a special thank you to Mr. Tu Xinhui. We met in 2012 
because of my work and remained close over the last six years. He has given me indis-
pensable advice on my career development and supported me through unforeseen 
circumstances in everyday life. He was always ready to offer his heartfelt support. 
Over the years that I discovered a new direction, new tastes, and new pursuits, I was 
lucky to have a friend like him.

I would like to thank all of my colleagues, co-workers, and experts in the corporate 
world. Gao Lutong read the ﬁrst draft of the book and offered suggestions for revisions 
and additions. Ge Yumin and Hu Xiaomeng helped me gather materials. A special 
thank you also to President and Editor-in-Chief Jiang Yongjun and editor Zhang 
Yingjie of the CITIC Frontier Publishing House of CITIC Publishing Group, who 
worked meticulously to prepare this book for publication. 
Finally, I would like to thank AllBright Law Ofﬁces and Dentons for handling all 
manner of legal affairs, which allowed me to concentrate on my work. 
The popularity of mobile phones and WeChat has had a major impact on the 
reading habits of the public. While I was writing this book, Jiang Yongjun told me to 
keep my paragraphs brief. It was not worth the trouble and not the best way to write a 
book. Instead, I hope this book will be a discussion. Even though I am the author and 
you are the reader, I welcome you to contact me through my WeChat public account. 
Wherever you are, an Internet connection can bring us together. All you need to do 
is scan my QR code. Our discussion will also become data. That recording process 
of our time together will also contribute to our Data Civilization. 
Yes, big data and AI will reshape the world, but the warmth of human nature 
cannot be changed. Things change; other things stay the same.
