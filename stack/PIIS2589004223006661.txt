SUMMARY
Exploring the neurobiology of the profound changes in consciousness induced by
classical psychedelic drugs may require novel neuroimaging methods. Serotonergic
psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin produce states of increased sensory-emotional
awareness and arousal, accompanied by increased spontaneous electroencephalo-
graphic (EEG) signal diversity. By directly stimulating cortical tissue, the altered dy-
namics and propagation of the evoked EEG activity can reveal drug-induced
changes in the overall brain state. We combine Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
(TMS) and EEG to reveal that psilocybin produces a state of increased chaotic brain
activity which is not a result of altered complexity in the underlying causal interac-
tions between brain regions. We also map the regional effects of psilocybin on
TMS-evoked activity and identify changes in frontal brain structures that may be
associated with the phenomenology of psychedelic experiences.
INTRODUCTION
Altered states of consciousness (ASCs) induced by psychedelic drugs represent an interesting tool for
investigating the neurobiological basis of conscious experience. These are states of altered mood, sensa-
tions, modes of thought, self-awareness, and the perceptual boundaries between them.1 ASCs can be
induced by administering compounds such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and N,
N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)2–4 and it is thought that these effects are mediated primarily by serotonin
2A receptor (5HT-2AR) agonism.2–9 There continues to be growing interest in the potential for these sub-
stances as psychotherapeutic interventions for conditions such as affective and addictive disorders.10–12
Therefore, models of their neurophysiological effects should be reﬁned in tandem with the development
of treatment models.
The presence of a conscious experience is typically associated with behavioral responsiveness and entails
differing degrees of awareness and arousal—both of which are high during waking and low during non-
rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and anesthesia. Aside from the pathological dissociation exhibited
by neurological patients affected by disorders of consciousness, an even more striking case is represented
by the presence of consciousness in the form of dreaming during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,13 a
state characterized by low arousal and behavioral unresponsiveness. In this context, compared to typical
waking consciousness, 5HT-2AR agonists elicit experiences of heightened arousal and sensory as well as
emotional awareness.12 Due to their shared phenomenology, these ASCs have been described as waking
lucid dream states.8,14
Empirical work has revealed that the diversity of electroencephalographic (EEG) signal patterns is high
whenever consciousness is present regardless of the degree of behavioral responsiveness and arousal,
to an extent that is comparable to that obtained during full-ﬂedged wakefulness.15–18 Interestingly, psyche-
delic-induced ASCs are accompanied by increased EEG signal diversity relative to typical wakefulness and
dreaming.19–21 This increased signal diversity could be due to enhanced causal interactions within the
brain, or rather be a product of unstructured and chaotic neuronal activity.21,22
To address this unknown, a potentially useful strategy is to assess the response of the brain to direct per-
turbations.22 Due to its non-invasiveness, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is particularly suited to

this aim, and the analysis of the ensuing EEG response can reveal how activity propagates in space and
time. The complexity of these spatiotemporal activity patterns is then measured by the Perturbational
Complexity Index (PCI) which, just as for spontaneous EEG signal diversity, displays high and similarly
distributed values for both dreaming and waking states.23–25
Measuring the complexity ensuing from direct cortical perturbations rather than that of spontaneous brain ac-
tivity is both theoretically26 and methodologically27 relevant as it tackles the problem of measuring causal rela-
tionships as opposed to statistical dependencies. This contrasts the inﬂuence of spurious sources of integration,
such as common drivers and correlated inputs, and minimizes the inﬂuence of noise, which can artiﬁcially affect
complexity estimations, e.g., in the presence of random patterns. As such, this comparison would help distin-
guish between a unitary system made of tightly interacting elements (the putative ideal candidate substrate
for consciousness) and an aggregate of largely independent generators of activity.
As yet, only one study has explored the behavior of PCI and spontaneous EEG signal diversity during ASCs
induced by sub-anesthetic doses of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine.21
The ASC induced by ketamine is characterized by personal dissociation and disembodiment.19,21 Interest-
ingly, results showed stable PCI values despite increased spontaneous signal diversity. From this, the au-
thors concluded that ketamine-induced ASCs may be states of increased chaotic neuronal activity, but un-
altered in the complexity of the underlying causal interactions.
Here, we sought to understand whether these effects are ketamine-speciﬁc or rather reproducible for clas-
sical psychedelics using the 5HT-2AR agonist psilocybin. Speciﬁcally, we analyzed spontaneous EEG signal
diversity as well as PCI values and employed a placebo-randomized double-blind study on a larger sample
size with respect to21. We were able to verify several ﬁndings of earlier studies and explored regional drug
effects along the rostro-caudal axis. We highlight an important distinction to be made between sponta-
neous and evoked brain activity during psychedelic-induced ASCs. We demonstrate that, despite preser-
ving similar PCI values, TMS-evoked activity is signiﬁcantly altered by psilocybin and provide the ﬁrst evi-
dence that these effects are associated with ASC phenomenology.
RESULTS
Participants underwent two randomized double-blind recording days with a two-week interval, wherein
either psilocybin or placebo capsules were administered. All participants (N = 22) experienced both
drug conditions and separate same-day EEG and TMS-EEG recording periods, followed by psychometric
questionnaires. Following drug administration, an EEG recording of restful eyes open (EO), and eyes
closed (EC) conditions was performed, which was then followed by three separate TMS-EEG recording ses-
sions with TMS targeted to three cortical areas along the rostro-caudal axis: Premotor Cortex (PM), Primary
Motor Cortex (M1), and Primary Somatosensory Cortex (S1) (Figure 1).
Contrasting effects of psilocybin on spontaneous and perturbational complexity
Measures of EEG signal complexity were applied to TMS-EEG and spontaneous EEG as deﬁned by the Pertur-
bationalComplexityIndex(PCI)and spontaneousLempel-Zivcomplexity(LZc),respectively. PCIreﬂectsthe num-
ber of unique binary sequences of signiﬁcant spatiotemporal activity at the source level with respect to the pre-
TMS baseline activity. On the other hand, LZc measures the number of unique binary sequences of signiﬁcant
events in the resting-state EEG at the sensor level relative to a statistically deﬁned threshold.
Perturbational complexity index is stable and unaltered by psilocybin
Individual PCI values across stimulation sites for on- and off-drug conditions appear to be similarly distrib-
uted and within the range of those previously published23,24,28 (Figures 2A and 2B). The distribution of PCI
values was not statistically signiﬁcantly changed—albeit showing increased mean and median values—af-
ter the administration of psilocybin as compared to placebo for any of the stimulated regions along the
rostro-caudal axis (Table S1). Pairwise t-testing reveals no signiﬁcant changes in PCI values and one-way
ANOVA applied to pairwise PCI change (psilocybin minus placebo) also ﬁnds no signiﬁcant differences be-
tween conditions and groups (SS = 0.003, df = 2, MS = 0.002, F = 0.31, Prob>F = 0.73). To account for the
possibility that this tendency may result from a change in the evolution of PCI following the TMS pulse, we
calculated PCI per millisecond (PCI(t)). PCI(t) was demonstrated to grow at a comparable rate in both pla-
cebo and psilocybin conditions (Figure 2C). Repeated measures ANOVA was applied to PCI values as

50 ms interval bins for each stimulation site to assess within-subject effects of conditions and times but
found no signiﬁcant interactions (all of p > 0.1) (Figure S1). TMS-evoked complexity was also measured
directly from channel activity, i.e., without source modeling, using the computationally faster alterna-
tive—PCI-State Transitions (PCI-ST).25 Consistent with PCI measured at the source level, psilocybin did
not signiﬁcantly alter PCI-ST (Figure S2).
Psilocybin-induced brain states display increased electroencephalographic signal diversity at
rest
We next computed LZc of the spontaneous EEG activity to assess the ongoing signal diversity present at
rest. Compared to placebo, psilocybin signiﬁcantly increased LZc with eyes closed (p < 10-3) but not eyes
open (Figures 2D and S3). Interestingly, closing the eyes signiﬁcantly reduced LZc during the placebo con-
dition (p < 10-4)—an effect that was not present after the administration of psilocybin (p > 0.1). The LZ
complexity of single channels (LZs) was also computed to provide additional information about the spatial
distribution of these changes in LZc (Figure S4). After correcting for the false discovery rate (FDR), psilocy-
bin signiﬁcantly increased LZs at posterior-occipital and medial-frontal channels during the eyes closed
condition, as well as the eyes open condition but for fewer channels. To investigate the effect of periodic

ity (LZsN), which removes continuous periodicity while retaining spectral power per frequency. Signiﬁcantly
affected regions were reduced to a few sparsely distributed channels with lower T-statistic values.
Psilocybin induces distinct spectral changes in electroencephalographic and transcranial
magnetic stimulation-electroencephalographic activity
We next sought to verify that the stability of PCI on- and off-psilocybin was not trivially explained by unal-
tered TMS-evoked responses. To account for known differences in evoked response properties across
cortical sites,29 we probed the effect of psilocybin along the rostro-caudal axis. Individual TMS-evoked po-
tentials (TEPs) were visualized by overlaying the trial-averaged voltage of each scalp electrode (Figure 3A).
The variation in instantaneous voltages across the scalp was quantiﬁed using Global Mean Field Power
(GMFP). Psilocybin-induced spectral changes were assessed for EEG and TMS-EEG activity using Power
Spectral Density (PSD) and global Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP), respectively.
Cortical reactivity is not altered by psilocybin
To summarize the complex structure of TEPs at each stimulation site, we ﬁrst described the global cortical
reactivity on- and off-drug using GMFP. Total GMFP was calculated as the sum of time-resolved GMFP

values between 50 and 200 ms post-stimulation. No statistically signiﬁcant changes in total GMFP were
observed after the administration of psilocybin at any of the stimulation sites (Figure 3B and Table S1).
We evaluated the time-resolved GMFP changes induced by psilocybin which identiﬁed sparse clusters
of statistical signiﬁcance (after correcting for multiple comparisons) post-stimulus for the M1 and Premotor
cortex (Figure S5).
Transcranial magnetic stimulation-related spectral activity is increased by psilocybin
TMS-evoked responses were transformed into the time-frequency domain to reveal non-stationary spectral
changes induced by psilocybin. Interestingly, individuals often varied in the effect of psilocybin on their
TEPs across all three stimulation sites. By averaging the time-frequency structure over all channels, the
global ERSP was used to further summarize drug-speciﬁc effects on TMS-related spectral activity. The
mean difference in ERSP between drug conditions suggested that psilocybin had affected spectral power

for all stimulation sites. This increase was greatest for the initial 20–200 ms and within a frequency window of
10–25 Hz (Figure S6). Mean global ERSP power in this time-frequency window was found to signiﬁcantly
increase during M1 stimulation for psilocybin compared to placebo (Figures 3C and 3D and Table S1).
Psilocybin reduces resting electroencephalographic spectral power
We next sought to compare the TMS-related spectral changes to broad spectral changes which also
appear while at rest, i.e., without stimulation. Resting-state PSD was computed for EO and EC conditions
and segmented into conventional EEG bands for analysis. For both EO and EC recording conditions, both
mean Theta (4–8 Hz) and Alpha (8–12 Hz) power were signiﬁcantly decreased after psilocybin administra-
tion (Figure 3E and Table S1).
Exploring associations between phenomenology and neurophysiology
Psychometric questionnaires were used to assess the phenomenological experiences of each participant
by measuring the degree of qualitative dimensions of the psilocybin-induced ASC directly after psychoac-
tive effects had ceased. The 11-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness (11D-ASC) rating scale was
used to test for relationships between phenomenological, EEG, and TMS-EEG features.30 EEG and
TMS-EEG measures were converted to relative change values (with respect to placebo, see STAR Methods)
to correct for individual baseline neurophysiological states.
Psilocybin induced strong and varied alterations in phenomenology
Ten of the eleven dimensions of the 11D-ASC scales were signiﬁcantly increased by the application of psi-
locybin (Figure 4A). Elementary Imagery, Complex Imagery, AudioVisual Synesthesia, Disembodiment,
Changed Meaning of Percepts, Cognitive Impairment, Unity, Insightfulness, Blissfulness, and Spiritual
experience were all signiﬁcantly increased by the application of psilocybin (Table S2). Only Anxiety was
not signiﬁcantly affected after correcting for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni correction for n = 11 com-
parisons). Signiﬁcant phenomenological changes as assessed by the 11D-ASC scales demonstrate that suf-
ﬁcient doses were provided to elicit the desired subjective alterations.
Relative change in transcranial magnetic stimulation-related 10–25 Hz power correlates with
phenomenology
A subset of features of the TMS-evoked response during psilocybin-induced brain states was found to
correlate with phenomenological effects. The strongest correlation coefﬁcient reported here (Figure 4B)
is the change of Blissfulness as a function of relative change in 10–25 Hz ERSP power (R = 0.924,
p < 10-6) after TMS of the PM cortex. When comparing the relative change in TMS-related 10–25 Hz spectral
power across stimulation sites with a relative change of resting-state EEG mean band power, we ﬁnd evi-
dence that the perturbational approach tends to yield more robust neurophenomenological correlates
(Figure 4C). Relative change in spectral power was also correlated with an experience of Unity (N = 17,
R = 0.7, p = 0.001). We also determined that Blissfulness was strongly correlated with other 11D-ASC
sub-dimensions such as Unity, and therefore the other correlations found here with TMS-evoked PM cortex
spectral changes are likely to be due to multicollinearity (Figure S7). Neither evoked nor spontaneous rela-
tive change of complexity measures across stimulation sites and behavioral states, i.e., EO or EC, provided
absolute Pearson correlation coefﬁcients of 0.5 or greater for 11D-ASC scores (Figure 4D).
DISCUSSION
We report that the TMS-evoked response is signiﬁcantly altered but no more or less complex during a psilocybin-
induced ASC compared to typical wakefulness. This stands in contrast to the increased spontaneous signal diver-
sity observed at rest with eyes closed. Through attempts to understand how these two orthogonal measures of
complexity are generated and related together, we found distinct properties of ongoing vs. evoked rhythms dur-
ing 5HT-2AR-mediated psychedelic states. This perturbational approach provided further insights as to the po-
tential relevance of brain (particularly frontal regions) state changes during psychedelic experiences.
Explaining the increased spontaneous but not evoked signal diversity
The contrast between the increased spontaneous signal diversity and the unaltered TMS-evoked spatiotem-
poral complexity is intriguing but not surprising. The spontaneous signal diversity measured by LZc reﬂects
the differentiability of EEG patterns over time but assumes spatial interactions are present without explicitly
accounting for them.31 This increased temporal differentiability could be due to spatially separate brain

regions, which may normally share common driver inputs, transitioning to a state of increased independence
from one another. EEG activity following direct cortical stimulation, however, reveals the spatiotemporal
structure of causal interactions in the brain, thus explicitly also estimating the degree of integration. The
absence of a change in PCI during an ASC, yet the increase in LZc, suggests that the underlying brain state
is unaltered in its ability to maintain complex causal interactions while allowing ongoing activity to be more
chaotic or noisy. Critically, this result for a 5HT-2AR-mediated ASC is consistent with the only other study of
PCI and LZc for sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine.21 This strongly suggests that these effects occur for both
classical psychedelic compounds and ketamine administration, despite differing receptor targets of action.
We ﬁnd that reducing visual input by closing the eyes decreased LZc during the placebo condition. For the psi-
locybin condition, however, participants often report elementary and complex visual experiences. Consistent
with previous work,19 we ﬁnd that LZc is higher after psilocybin administration compared to placebo when the
eyes are closed despite the lack of exogenous visual stimuli. It is plausible that this heightened signal diversity
reﬂects endogenously generated chaotic neuronal activity during ASCs. However, we found no correlations be-
tween the degree of change in LZc and the reported visual effects of psilocybin. Eye closure and therefore

reduced visual processing is known to result in increased spectral power, especially within the alpha frequency
band. It has often been speculated that periods of highly synchronized alpha-band power introduce repetitive
patterns in EEG signals which reduce pattern diversity and therefore LZc.20–22,31 As we had observed this typical
reduction in alpha-band power, we explored how this related to our LZc ﬁndings. We found that changes in both
LZc and alpha-band power were signiﬁcantly negatively correlated in both placebo and psilocybin conditions
(Figure S8). By performing phase-shufﬂe normalization of LZc (LZcN) we could partially account for periods of
high oscillatory behavior. LZcN was uncorrelated with alpha-band power, which predominantly affected signal
diversity when alpha-band power was high. Given that alpha-band power is often lower in the psilocybin condi-
tion, it is plausible that increased LZc values are a result of fewer or reduced alpha-band oscillatory sequences.
Resting-stateEEG alpha-band activity is characteristically strongest onposteriorchannels,32 while theta-bandac-
tivity is present in the medial frontal channels.33 Given that we ﬁnd evidence for these two frequency bands being
reduced by psilocybin, it is plausible that decreased spectral power would also be accompanied by increased LZ
values at these locations. We present single-channel LZ (LZs) data for this purpose, which suggest that LZs is
increased on medial frontal and posterior-occipital channels for both eyes open and eyes closed conditions,
the effect of which is diminished when LZs is normalized by phase-shufﬂing (LZsN) (Figure S4). We speculate
that there is evidence to suggest an inﬂuence of spectral changes induced by psilocybin on spontaneous EEG
signal diversity.
Despite reduced spectral power around 10Hz in spontaneous EEG activity, oscillatory activity in similar fre-
quencies could be ampliﬁed by perturbation (Figures 3C and 3D). The loss of spontaneous oscillatory power
may reﬂect a diminished capacity for neurons to synchronize at these frequencies. Although, the TMS-evoked
responses suggest that neuronal populations can still sustain synchronized entrainment when perturbed. It is
important to note, however, that the ongoing brain rhythms at rest may be the result of global network
behavior,34 such as the default mode network (DMN)35 and dorsal attention network,36,37 whereas evoked
rhythms should reﬂect dynamics following the perturbation of a speciﬁc part of a network of interacting brain
regions.21,22,29 Due to this orthogonality between observational and perturbational approaches to characterizing
drug-induced changes in brain state, purely observational brain activity may not necessarily predict how a brain
may react to external stimuli. For this reason, previously speculated functional roles of speciﬁc frequency bands
in resting EEG activity during ASCs38 may be clariﬁed by employing a multimodal approach.7
The role of the frontal cortex and phenomenological altered states of consciousness
correlates
To further explore the psilocybin-induced changes in TMS-related oscillations we explored their regional
aspects. Probing stimulation sites along the rostro-caudal axis revealed several evoked response proper-
ties which were altered by psilocybin across frontal structures. Increased 10–25 Hz ERSP power when stim-
ulating the M1 cortex was noticed following psilocybin administration. We also clariﬁed that psilocybin
does not signiﬁcantly alter the overall GMFP during the early TMS-evoked response at any stimulate
site, which reﬂects no global change in reactivity across the scalp. Performing a time-resolved GMFP anal-
ysis found that psilocybin altered a sparsely distributed set of time points. However, given the high varia-
tion across individuals and that these are not believed to be due to any speciﬁc TEP component, we pro-
pose that psilocybin does not reliably alter global reactivity across participants. Psilocybin also caused
varied 10–25 Hz ERSP power changes across individuals which were strongly correlated with changes in
experienced Blissfulness and Unity, as measured by the 11D-ASC scales. However, similarly strong corre-
lations were not observed for changes in spontaneous EEG frequency band power. In a single-subject
study, it was reported that for a meditation expert, shifting between phenomenologically distinct medita-
tion states was accompanied by changes in PM cortex 25–35 Hz ERSP power.39
The reaction of the frontal structures and their relationship to phenomenology could be a result of their position
within the cortical hierarchy;40,41 frontal structures are typically associated with executive function and behavioral
control.42,43 It is plausible that frontal cortical structures are disproportionately inﬂuenced by psilocybin4 and by
the distribution of 5-HT2ARs present there.44 These results offer further evidence for the hypothesis that classical
psychedelic drugs which target primarily 5HT-2ARs affect frontal brain structures via altered thalamocortical dy-
namics.9,12 While the receptor mechanisms for ketamine and psilocybin may be different, the ‘‘glutamatergic
overspill’’ hypothesis posits that both ketamine and serotonergic hallucinogens have a shared neuronal mech-
anism; both sets of compounds modulate medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) Layer 1 (L1) and 5 (L5) pyramidal neu-
rons and/or activation of metabotropic glutamate type 2 (mGlu2) autoreceptors on thalamocortical afferents to
mPFC. This creates a positive feedback loop of glutamate release in populations of neurons in the frontal cortex

which reduces the ﬁring threshold and increases spontaneous ﬁring. These effects have been further implicated
in the hallucinogen-induced head-twitch response in mice, motoric impulsivity, and anti-depressant effects in
rats.45 This model could plausibly account for both the multiple instances of ASC-relevant frontal region changes
we have found and the increased spontaneous signal diversity which we veriﬁed in a hallucinogen acting primar-
ily via another receptor target. However, the transferability of these rodent study results to models of human
behavior is yet to be fully established.
Conclusion
We have established that changes in spontaneous EEG signal diversity and stability of perturbational
complexity are reproducible across psychedelic-induced ASCs acting via different primary receptor types.
We provide further evidence that PCI reliably indicates which brain states are accompanied by awareness
but is not a measure for speciﬁc features of phenomenology. By verifying LZc as a biomarker for psyche-
delic-induced ASCs, we found that increases in spontaneous signal diversity are potentially a product of
previously known spontaneous EEG spectral changes induced by psilocybin. We provide evidence for psilo-
cybin-induced losses in spontaneous rhythmicity which can be elicited and ampliﬁed when perturbed by TMS,
suggesting that this perturbational neuroimaging approach provides insights for psychedelic-induced ASCs
which are distinct from resting-state EEG. Regional drug effects on TMS-evoked rhythms and their spatiotem-
poral structure were shown to be associated with speciﬁc psilocybin-induced ASC phenomenological states.
Limitations of the study
While the sample size we used should be sufﬁcient to investigate the effect of psilocybin on TMS-evoked
EEG activity, the number of features that could be extracted was challenging for more complex analyses.
Techniques for identifying latent feature spaces to better explore neurophenomenology often require
larger sample sizes to detect measures of the greatest value reliably, and therefore it is hoped that larger
studies could expand on the ﬁndings we report here. Although dose was not identiﬁed as a factor in our
study for any neurophysiological metrics, expanding the dose range in future studies could prove insight-
ful. Dose-per-weight values were chosen in this study to ensure that psilocybin did not elicit unwanted be-
haviors in participants, e.g., excessive movement, and retained meaningful comparisons between condi-
tions. This study has also demonstrated that psilocybin can be applied safely in a TMS-EEG setting if
performed appropriately. It is likely that uncontrolled yet known factors such as the ‘‘set and setting’’
(i.e., a participant’s expectations and their surroundings, respectively) could inﬂuence the quality of the psi-
locybin experience and subsequently the psychometric ratings.46–49 An example of this effect is hinted at
by the low occurrence of anxiety reported in the 11D-ASC scores, which in the context of a TMS-EEG study
reﬂects a balance between controlled recording conditions and the minimized discomfort of participants.
This is of course coupled with the challenge of effective double-blinding in research using psychedelic
drugs.50 All steps were taken to maximally reproduce identical procedures on placebo and psilocybin
recording days. It is also important to note that drug-induced ASCs are phenomenologically dynamic.
Therefore, although TMS-EEG and EEG may capture brief periods of an ASC state they may not accurately
reﬂect the ongoing transitions between phenomenological states experienced by participants. We also at-
tempted to probe the higher visual cortex using TMS-EEG, however, practical constraints meant that these
recordings were not guided by neuro-navigation and therefore were not included in the ﬁndings of this
study (Figure S9). Theoretically, it may be also challenging to accurately discriminate the multidimensional
changes in emotion, thought, perception, and self of ASCs using one-dimensional scales such as PCI and
LZc51,52 which, by constitution may be quite sensitive but rather unspeciﬁc to the presence of any of the
phenomenological dimensions. Future studies may therefore beneﬁt from a multimodal approach as we
have found it useful in this investigation of multiple brain regions, imaging methods, and measures.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
25 healthy, right-handed participants (7 females, 18 males, mean age 24.44, range from 21 to 29 years) were
recruited, screened for eligibility, and investigated twice at a 14-day interval with TMS-EEG in a random-
ized, within-subject, placebo-controlled, and double-blind setting. All subjects provided written informed
consent. The experimental protocol was approved by the local ethics committee of Zurich (BASEC Nr.:
2018-01866; NCT03853577). The use of psilocybin was authorized by the Swiss Federal Ofﬁce of Public
Health.
All participants were screened beforehand for past and present health conditions to exclude incompatibil-
ities with psilocybin usage and/or TMS procedure. This included psychiatric interviewing, an internist
check-up, blood analysis, electrocardiogram (ECG), EEG, and cerebral magnetic resonance tomography
(cMRT). Urinalysis was done on experimental days to exclude recreational substance use and pregnancy.
Three participants were excluded from analysis due to an insufﬁcient peak-to-peak amplitude (<10 mV)
of the initial TMS-EEG response within the ﬁrst 20 trials of the online measurement, following the protocols
outlined previously.53
METHOD DETAILS
Procedures
All experimental procedures were performed at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland
(Figure 1). Every participant received bodyweight-adjusted psilocybin formulated as capsules of 5 mg
PO (20 mg over 80 kg, 15 mg for 50–80 kg, 10 mg below 50 kg; mean dosage 225 mg/kg/participant) on
one measurement day and placebo (100% mannitol) on the other in a counterbalanced manner. Sponta-
neous EEG (5 min of eyes open followed by 5 min with eyes closed) was recorded before starting TMS-
EEG sessions. Subjects were stimulated at three different cortical sites on the right hemisphere near to
midline, targeting the premotor cortex (Brodmann area 6), the primary motor cortex (Brodmann area 4),
and the primary somatosensory cortex (Brodmann area 1–3). These stimulation sites were selected to cover
multiple positions along the rostro-caudal axis and to minimize TMS-evoked muscle artifacts (typically
associated with cortical lateral aspect stimulation) during the recordings. On each measurement day,

before substance intake, a ﬁrst baseline measure was performed at selected stimulation sites. Each TMS-
EEG recording session consisted of 200 TMS pulses per stimulation site at 100 ms-jittered 2000–2500 ms
intervals (a duration of 7 min each) perfomed while subjects kept their eyes open. The stimulation target
was selected using neuro-navigation and guided by estimate E-ﬁeld until the TMS-EEG response had a
peak-to-peak amplitude of 10mV within 20 trials – The operational criterion previously established.53 Stim-
ulation parameters, i.e., TMS-coil angle, tilt, position, and intensity, were applied as necessary to establish
this EEG threshold criterion before recording began.24,53 In a minority of placebo TMS-EEG recordings
which were of insufﬁcient quality relative to their baseline pre-intake recording, the baseline recording
was used as the non-psilocybin reference recording (Figure S10). Any such re-referenced recordings
were excluded from any correlation analyses.
After substance intake, a meditative atmosphere was installed by dimming light sources, showing nature
scenes on a screen, and playing down-tempo music. These measures were taken to create a pleasant
change in the participants’ state of consciousness as induced by psilocybin. Spontaneous EEG was re-
corded 60 min after oral ingestion, which was then followed by TMS-EEG recordings using the same target
regions in randomized order and adopting the same stimulation parameters (stimulation intensity, coil
angle/tilt). In addition, participants’ ECG was continuously monitored, and blood pressure was taken at
regular intervals. Subjective dimensions of the ASC experience were measured using questionnaires at
the end of the experiment.
TMS-EEG apparatus
TMS was performed using a 75 mm focal-bipulse butterﬂy coil (MCF-B65, MagVenture, Neurolite AG,
Switzerland) driven by a mobile stimulator unit (MagPro R30, MagVenture, Neurolite AG, Switzerland).
TMS pulses were triggered from a laptop using a trigger box (E.M.S. Sistemi Elettromedicali, Italy).
EEG measurements were recorded by using TMS-compatible 2x32-channel BrainAmp MR + ampliﬁers
(Brain Products GmbH, Germany) attached to high-density 64-channel caps (BrainCap-TMS, EasyCap, Ger-
many). The impedance of all electrodes was kept below 5kU, EEG signals were ﬁltered DC-1000 Hz,
sampled at 5000 Hz, and referenced to an electrode positioned above the nasion. Two sensors were
used to record the electrooculogram with a diagonal montage. Using these experimental settings, the
duration of the TMS pulse artifact was shorter than 5 ms.
Altered state consciousness
Psilocybin is a classic and safe hallucinogenic substance to induce a well-deﬁned and transient altered state
of waking consciousness. In healthy human participants, it is generally not associated with long-term
perceptual, cognitive, or neurological dysfunctions. It unfolds its phenomenological characteristics by
partially agonizing primarily the serotoninergic 5-HT2AR, which in turn induces dose-dependent psycho-
logical destabilization of self-other boundaries, emotional changes, sensory and time perception alter-
ations, spiritual feelings of unity, and insightfulness with the external world.54 Psilocybin was given as a sin-
gle moderate dose orally (mean 225 mg/kg/participant) with a peak effect 60–80 min after ingestion and
fading out of symptoms 4 h later. Considerate guidance of participants and maintaining a safe environment
throughout the daylong experiment ensured no unwanted or unpleasant effects (e.g., anxious ego disso-
lution). The lab was kept warm >21C, a separate screen showed slow-moving nature scenery, low volume
down-tempo music was played, and the front wall was furnished with a colorful tree tapestry.
The Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (ASC), a well-validated and one of the most widely
applied self-rating scale with 94 visual analog items (0–100%), was used to reliably quantify the subjective
drug effects (psilocybin, placebo).55–57 The scale comprises 5 main dimensions (factors) of ASC: oceanic
(self) boundlessness; dreadful ego dissolution, visual restructuralization, auditory alterations, and vigilance
reduction, which can be further characterized by 11 second-order scales: Experience of unity; spiritual ex-
periences; blissfulness; insightfulness; disembodiment; impaired cognition and control; anxiety; elemen-
tary imagery; complex imagery; audio-visual synesthesia; and changed meaning of percepts.30 This latter
set of predeﬁned subdimensions was used for this study because it provided a broad yet reliable set of fea-
tures for correlation analyses.

TMS-EEG pre-processing
Pre-processing was performed using functions extracted from EEGLAB-2014b58 and custom-written func-
tions for TMS-induced artifact removal. For each EEG channel, signals in a 2 ms to +5 ms window around
the TMS onset were replaced with mirroring of the signals from 9 ms to 2 ms to remove the TMS pulse
artifact. A moving average ﬁlter was then applied. Slow voltage drifts were excluded by ﬁtting a low-order
polynomial to the data and then subtracting it (‘detrending’). Bad channel and trial rejection was carried out
and data were re-referenced to the channel average. 1–45 Hz ﬁltering was used with a 50 Hz line noise ﬁlter.
Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to remove common EEG artifacts such as eye movements,
cardiac interference, and muscle activity, and TMS artifacts such as the TMS decay and TMS-induced mus-
cle twitch responses. The data was downsampled from 5000 Hz to 1000 Hz and bad channels were interpo-
lated. These pre-processing steps, when averaged across trials and aligned to the TMS event, produce the
TMS-evoked potential (TEP).
EEG pre-processing
Functions from EEGLAB-2014b58 were used to remove artifacts and noise from resting-state EEG record-
ings. Detrending and 1st-order high-pass ﬁltering (0.01 Hz cut-off) were applied, followed by low- and high-
pass Butterworth ﬁltering of 0.5 and 40 Hz, respectively, and a 50 Hz notch ﬁlter. Segmentation into
2-second epochs was then used for bad channel removal and interpolation, which were then re-referenced
to mean channel activity. Bad epoch rejection was performed before ICA to remove common behavioral
artifacts similar to TMS-EEG components.
GMFP
As used in previous studies,28,59 GMFP was computed per millisecond as the standard deviation of poten-
tials across scalp electrodes, with respect to the mean channel potential at that time point. The application
of GMFP was therefore to summarize the global spatial structure of the TMS-evoked response. Let X be the
trial average of the EEG data for channels (C) and time-point (t),

GMFP was baseline-corrected by subtracting the mean GMFP of the pre-stimulus period (100 ms to
1 ms) from all GMFP(t) values. Total GMFP is calculated as the sum of GMFP(t) values within a speciﬁc
time window.
ERSP
The time-frequency domain of TMS-evoked responses was analyzed using event-related spectral perturba-
tion (ERSP). ERSP applies wavelet transformation (Morlet method, 3.5 cycles) and was performed using the
public license toolbox EEGLAB.58 The ERSP values of single channels were averaged to yield the global
ERSP (gERSP) for each TMS-EEG session. Mean spectral power was deﬁned here as the average gERSP
value in a time window of 20–200 ms and a frequency window of 10–25 Hz. The time window was selected
to avoid artifactually inﬂated mean gERSP values and summarize robust spectral features of canonical TMS-
evoked responses, as previously established.29 The mean change in ERSP between conditions was used to
select the frequency band for which all stimulation sites were affected which was empirically decided to be
10–25 Hz.
PSD
To analyze resting-state EEG in the time-frequency domain, we separately calculated the Power Spectral
Density (PSD) of the potentials for eyes open and closed periods. Restricted to 1–45 Hz and implemented
using the pwelch function from the EEGLAB toolbox.58 Reported mean values are the average power of all
frequencies within the conventional bands.
PCI
PCI was computed using identical procedures to those employed by Casali et al. (2013)23: source modeling
using empirical Bayesian optimization of the Weighted Minimum Norm constraint was used to localize
electromagnetic sources of scalp EEG potentials; non-parametric statistics (alpha = 0.01) across trials
were applied to binarize the TMS-evoked response, which labels signiﬁcant source amplitudes per unit

time and source. After sorting sources by their total signiﬁcant events, Lempel-Ziv complexity (C) was then
computed to measure the number of unique binary strings present in the spatiotemporal response (L). C is
then normalized by the binary entropy (H) of L (Figure S11), which yields the PCI value. PCI as a function of
time can be computed using the same procedure but using the momentary Ct instead of the ﬁnal value of C.
We ascertained that all binary matrices for which we computed PCI generated an entropy value larger than
0.08, i.e., displayed a percentage of signiﬁcant values greater than the rate of false positives of the statis-
tics (1%).
An alternative measure of evoked complexity, PCI-ST,25 was applied at the sensor level. Eigenvectors
generated from channel activity by principal component analysis were then ranked by their eigenvalue.
The set of eigenvectors contributing 99% of the response variance was retained for further analysis. Recur-
rence Quantiﬁcation Analysis was then applied to identify points of recurrence in the amplitude of each
eigenvector as a measure of ‘state transitions’. The product of the number of eigenvectors and their
respective total state transitions forms the PCI-ST value (see Comolatti et al., 201925 for further
information).
LZc
To describe resting-state EEG signal complexity we applied Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZc) as used in previ-
ous studies.19–21,31 Consecutive sequences of epochs, i.e., epoch sets without time points rejected during
data cleaning, were concatenated into 10-s epochs for analysis. The analytic signal of single-channel EEG
potentials is used for thresholding, which results in binary sequences for each channel. The binary values
across all channels per time point are then concatenated to form a single binary sequence for all channels
and times. Recordings were segmented into 10-s epochs and the LZc of each epoch was calculated. LZc has
been demonstrated to be sensitive to decreasing epoch lengths,31 and therefore the epoch size was cho-
sen to minimize this effect of insufﬁciently long epochs on LZc values. The LZc value for the recording is then
reported as the average value across all epochs. To prevent occasional outlier epochs with excessively
large or small values from skewing the average LZc, only values between the 25th and 75th percentile of
a distribution of LZc values within each epoch were used.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All statistical analyses were performed using built-in functions from either MATLAB or R-studio. Prior to null
hypothesis testing using t-test functions all variables were checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to
conﬁrm their assumed normal distribution. Statistical analyses performed in MATLAB were reproduced
using R-studio by different individuals who were blinded to the true drug conditions of the datasets. Sta-
tistical procedures which comprise analytical methods used in this work, e.g., ERSP and PCI, can be found in
their respective publications.
