Alfred Adler (1870-1937) was born in a suburb of 
Vienna, the son of a Jewish grain merchant. He became a medical 
doctor and was one of the first to take a serious interest in the 
theories of Sigmund Freud, recognizing that they opened up a new 
phase in the development of psychiatry and psychology. He joined 
Freud's discussion group and in 1910 became President of the 
Vienna Psychoanalytic Society. Shortly afterwards the divergence 
between his views and those of Freud and Jung led to his resignation. 
It is clear both that Adler's work is deeply indebted to his 
one-time colleague, and that from the beginning he had an 
independent approach to formulating the problems of human 
psychology and finding solutions to them. In 1912 he formed the 
Society for Individual Psychology, which stressed the importance 
of taking a broad and responsive view of the human personality, 
rather than adherence to the strict scientific principles of the 
Freudians. He died in 1937, while on a lecture tour of Scotland, 
and his name is bracketed with those of Freud and Jung as one of 
the three great fathers of modern psychotherapy. 
Colin Brett is an Adlerian counsellor and former Training 
Officer of the Adlerian Society of Great Britain. He currently 
works as a freelance management consultant and Adlerian Coun- 
sellor Trainer in both Great Britain, Ireland and South Africa. He 
is the translator of Alfred Adler's Understanding Human Nature 
and the editor of What Life Could Mean to You, both published 
by Oneworld Publications, 1992.

About this Book 
First published in English in 1927, ten years before Adler's death, 
Understanding Life covers the main principles of Individual 
Psychology. This text is especially interesting to students of 
Adler's method because it contains numerous examples to illus- 
trate the theoretical points made. The connecting thread through- 
out the book is the importance of having an understanding of 
society's needs and our willingness to contribute usefully wher- 
ever we can to the common weal. Readers will also find that 
common sense plays a significant role in Adler's thinking. Indeed, 
there is a story that, after he had held a lecture on his psychology, 
the comment was made that everything he had said was common 
sense. 'And what is wrong with common sense?' was the reply.

not a systematic writer. Several of the books which bear his name 
were in fact not written by him, but were collections of his lectures 
or of notes made by other people during his lectures. This is also 
the case with this text. Much of the charisma which carried 
Adler's early message to his listeners has therefore been lost to us, 
and in places such books may seem repetitive and superficial, 
lacking the refinement of phrase and clarity of structure which 
the writing process better facilitates. However, they nevertheless 
contain flashes of insight and seemingly throw-away lines which 
clearly show that Individual Psychology is a subtle and eminently 
viable method. 
In places Adler sounds judgemental and harsh. Certain groups 
have, in Adler's eyes, either no or low social interest (a form of 
community spirit), and are therefore poorly regarded. Indeed, the 
Adlerian view is that there is a direct relationship between an 
individual's lack of social interest and the development and degree 
of neurosis. Two points need to be made here. As with all things, 
it is not a question of whether or not one has something, it is a 
question of how much of it one has. Secondly, while Individual 
Psychology continues to spread throughout the world and be- 
comes increasingly recognized as a potent and pragmatic psychol- 
ogy, certain aspects of its theory need to be seen as products of 
their time, just as Adler needs to be seen against his temporal and 
social background. While Adler was a genius, he was not always 
necessarily right.

main concepts and approach. The intention behind this new, 
revised and updated edition is to offer a more accessible introduc- 
tion to Adler that will appeal not just to Adlerian counsellors but 
also to students of psychology and interested laypersons. Conse- 
quently, sections of the text have been re-ordered to improve the 
flow of argument, sub-headings have been added for greater 
clarity, and certain expressions and terms have been updated in 
accordance with current English usage or modern Adlerian prac- 
tice. Readers should also note that instead of using 'she' or 'heY, 
the plural pronoun has been used wherever possible. A glossary 
of key terms, suggestions for further reading and an index have 
also been added for ease of use. 
Exactly how much refining and reorganization was undertaken 
by the editor of the first edition is not known. His or her name 
has not been recorded, nor have the original transcripts of Adler's 
talks survived, but it is hoped that this further revision process will 
enable Adler's great contributions to twentieth-century 
psychology to be appreciated by a wider audience. 
Key Concepts of Individual Psychology 
Individual Psychology is a system through which people can be 
understood. It is of particular value in the worlds of counselling 
and psychotherapy, education, organizational life and self-help. 
It is a philosophy, a view of the future and a way of helping us to 
make sense of how we and other people have become who and 
how we are.

u n d e r s t a n d i n g  l i f e  
Individual Psychology is a social psychology, it sees people as 
being fully functioning units who somehow have to cope with 
living together on a planet. It is indisputable that we need each 
other, for without each other we would not survive. Thus one of 
the main precepts of Individual Psychology is social interest. Our 
social interest is our active belonging to a group. We are aware 
of our own strengths, resources and abilities, we are aware of 
society's needs, we have and use our empathy to put ourselves 
into our fellow human beings' situations and we contribute so as 
to improve everybody's lot. Social interest can be summed up in 
the phrase 'me with you' as opposed to 'me against you' (which 
would be the Adlerian definition of neurosis). Sometimes social 
interest sounds like a code of conduct for do-gooders, and indeed 
Adler himself described it as being an ideal and a vision for the 
future of humankind, rather than something which already ex- 
isted. But doing good things is not 'do-gooding', and social 
interest is open-eyed co-operation, an innate ability which can be 
learnt and developed, and even though it is a concept for the 
future, it is something which we can see in aspects of our lives 
today to a greater or lesser extent. 
Individual Psychology teaches us that we are all goal-directed 
beings, that is we move purposefully through life towards goals 
which attract us. These goals have been set by us ourselves, often 
without our conscious realization. Goals are what motivate us, 
they are perceived as being the best way for us to survive, they 
are in general what we want or what we believe in our heart of 
hearts to be best for us. Individual Psychology, then, does not

i n t r o d u c t i o n  
regard people as being driven by the past, but rather as being 
attracted by the future, a future which they create for themselves. 
We all have a myriad of short, medium and long-term goals in 
our lives, and all these goals will have one thing in common. This 
is what Adler referred to as the 'long-term goal' or the 'fictional 
final goal'. It is in a way unfortunate that he uses this term, 
because this 'theme of themes' is not so much a goal, as a recurrent 
melody in the music of our lives, or a repeated master-pattern. An 
example of a 'fictional final goal' might be: 'I want to be good'; 
it is final, because it is the ultimate achievement of our lives, and 
fictional because we can never achieve it. The study of the 
long-term goal is called teleology. 
Finally, where there is a goal there is a line of movement towards 
it. As Adler points out, if we can clearly see this 'line of direction', 
then we can take a good guess at what the final goal must be. 
This is a psychology which studies purpose. All behaviour is 
seen as purposive; in other words, an Adlerian will look for the 
psychological gain behind what each of us is doing (thinking, 
feeling and acting are all considered to be behaviours, because 
they are things we do). When we understand the reasons for our 
behaviours, then we can change them; to focus on behaviours 
without looking behind and beyond them is the same as treating 
a symptom, not the cause. If the cause is unchanged, another 
symptom will replace the first one. Adler referred to his method 
as a 'hard' psychology; 'hard' in the sense that it is confrontative 
with regard to the unknown reasons we have for what we do. It 
can be a challenging experience to be revealed to oneself.

Closely connected with personal goals and purpose is the 
concept of inferiority. There is no doubt that mankind is biologi- 
cally inferior to nature. We become ill or old and die. We fear the 
elements and have to build houses to protect ourselves. These 
things and countless others are greater than us, and we are 
therefore inferior, in a positive sense. And yet there are perceived 
inferiorities which are by their nature negative. One of these is 
the myth of social inferiority, where we believe that certain people 
are 'worse' than others, worth less than other people. If we (and 
they) hold such a belief, even if it is not true, we (and they) will 
act accordingly. 
On the one hand, then, our physical and intellectual inferiori- 
ties are factual, and natural. As children we all feel inferior, and 
are so. However, as we grow up we lose - or should lose - this 
sense of inferiority. We do not always do so. Many of us doubt 
our equal human value and have in some aspect of our lives a 
feeling that we are not as good as other people. As we are social 
beings and do not wish other people to see that we feel inferior, 
we try to cover this up by developing and displaying some form 
of superiority. We have a number of ways of doing this, one of 
which is overcompensation (i.e. doing something more than the 
situation demands), another is deprecating others, yet another is 
avoiding everything which could risk our exposure. In other 
words, we are moving from a felt minus to a desired plus, from a 
feeling of not being good enough to a belief that we are indeed 
good enough - a natural development, and one which can be 
encouraged. This, in turn, means that the felt sense of inferiority

On the one hand, then, our physical and intellectual inferiori­
ties are factual, and natural. As children we all feel inferior, and 
are so. However, as we grow up we lose - or should lose - this 
sense of inferiority. We do not always do so. Many of us doubt 
our equal human value and have in some aspect of our lives a 
feeling that we are not as good as other people. As we are social 
beings and do not wish other people to see that we feel inferior, 
we try to cover this up by developing and displaying some form 
of superiority. We have a number of ways of doing this, one of 
which is overcompensation (i.e. doing something more than the 
situation demands), another is deprecating others, yet another is 
avoiding everything which could risk our exposure. In other 
words, we are moving from a felt minus to a desired plus, from a 
feeling of not being good enough to a belief that we are indeed 
good enough - a natural development, and one which can be 
encouraged. This, in turn, means that the felt sense of inferiority 
XIV 

i n t r o d u c t i o n  
is useful, as we wish to move away from it, and in doing so we 
develop ourselves and society. The felt minus, then, is only a 
problem when it hinders our progress or when we try to overcome 
it by seeking a 'desired plus' on the socially 'useless' side of life. 
We have seen above that the concept of moving towards a goal 
is fundamental to Individual Psychology. Courage is the fuel that 
we use to move us towards our socially useful goals. Courage is 
also a belief in self and can be described by the phrase 'I can' as 
opposed to the belief that 'I can't'. Courage implies the willingness 
to 'have a go' and to do what we can, focusing on our willingness 
to contribute and our efforts to do so, rather than focusing on a 
perfect and completed product or action. Adlerian counselling 
and therapy can be seen as the process whereby someone gains 
courage, i.e. a belief in themselves and their own abilities. The 
counselling process is seen as moving from a belief that 'I'll only 
do it if I'm sure I'll be successful' to 'I'll give it my best shot'. Being 
courageous, i.e. believing in ourselves, implies being independent 
of success and failure, that our self-worth does not depend on 
getting it right or being right, but on doing what we can do when 
the situation demands our input. Failure to an Adlerian is not not 
succeeding, but rather not trying. 
Encouragement, then, is seen as the development of 
self-esteem, growth in the belief that 'I am good enough as I am'. 
Individual Psychology teaches that we are what we believe, that 
our conscious thoughts, our feelings, our emotions and our 
behaviour are all the products of a unique belief system which 
each of us holds out of our awareness. In part our beliefs will

match those held by the people around us, and this we refer to as 
common sense. The area in which our belief system differs from 
other people's is referred to as private logic. On the one hand, it 
is my private logic that makes me who I am, makes me unique, 
on the other hand it can become a source of difficulty in that it 
can hinder me from being a fully functioning member of society. 
My beliefs become the source of my inabilities. 
One aspect of private logic is the 'only if' beliefs I hold. Picking 
up the example above, I am likely to attempt a task only if I am 
likely to succeed. This shows how I restrict myself, avoid risks 
(which might well lead to personal growth) and keep my 
self-esteem at a low ebb. I act as if my private logic were real and 
correct. This 'as if' element in our belief system helps us to create 
fictions about ourselves, life and other people, in accordance with 
which we then lead our lives. The purpose of Adlerian counselling 
and therapy is to disclose to clients their private logic, help them 
to understand which of their privately held beliefs are actually 
ideas which interfere with their daily functioning, and, through a 
carefully planned series of actions, to lessen the exclusive quality 
of the private logic and help them to lead more fulfilled lives. 
This is a psychology of use, not possession. Important to 
an Adlerian is not so much what abilities each of us has 
been born with or developed, but rather what we do with 
what we have. Similarly, what we do is more important 
than what we say; Adler's advice is, when in doubt, 'close 
your ears and observe': when the lady protests too much, 
ask yourself why she is doing this.

introduction 
Perception, or the way we see ourselves, the world and people, 
is fundamental to this psychology. Adlerian counsellors do not 
try to change life, but the way someone experiences life. The 
purpose of Adlerian therapy is to help clients change their percep- 
tive frameworks, i.e. to see things differently. 
Like other psychologies, Individual Psychology sometimes 
speaks in generalizations. Nonetheless, it stresses the uniqueness 
of the individual and his or her creative abilities, and can therefore 
only give guidelines for our thinking. Adler very wisely said 'alles 
kann immer anders sein (things can always be different)', which 
prevents Adlerians from using classifications and putting their 
clients into hard and fast categories. 
Adler's Work 
Ellenberger (pp. 599 ff.) divides Adler's work into six phases: 
1. Social medicine, 1 898-1 909 
Early on in his career as a doctor, Adler conceived and 
expressed his ideas in the area of social medicine. In his Health 
Book for the Tailoring Trade Adler explains that he wants to 
show the relationship between the economic situation and 
disease in a given trade, and the resulting prejudice to public 
health. The idea behind this was that disease can be a product 
of society. This phase in Adler's thinking shows a move 
towards blending socialism with medicine. Also at this time 
he advocated a teaching post with a seminar for social

medicine where problems of social hygiene would be explored 
with a view to finding their solution. 
2. The theory of organ inferiority, 1909-1 1 
While this theory was not new, Adler's contribution lay in 
developing a systematic theory of organ inferiority and the 
relating compensatory process. 
3. The theory of neurosis, 191 1-1 8 
Here Adler focused on the importance of early childhood 
situations and was influenced by the publication of Vaihin- 
ger's The Philosophy of the As If. Adler used Vaihinger's 
conception of 'fictions'. Humankind lives 'as if ' certain values 
were facts, 'as if' certain beliefs were true. We live 'as if' there 
were an ideal norm for human activity (the 'iron-clad logic of 
social living'). To Adler, abnormality is the degree of an 
individual's deviation from that fictitious norm. Neuroses are 
conceived as varieties of such a deviation. Referring to inferi- 
ority, Adler added the notion that feelings of inferiority can 
also be brought forth by purely social factors and that even 
when there is an organ inferiority, the psychological reaction 
is the main element. In other words, our perception of the 
event is more important than the event itself. 
4. Individual Psychology, 1 9 1 8-25

the fore during this period. Also at this time Adler stated

more clearly than he had before; they showed that this prag- 
matic approach to human living does not pretend to go into 
matters very deeply, but rather provides principles and meth- 
ods to enable us to gain a practical knowledge of ourselves 
and others. Individual Psychology is portrayed as being essen- 
tially a study of interpersonal relationships. People are never 
considered in an isolated situation, but in the light of their 
actions and reactions to each other. 
5. Psychotherapy and education 
During this phase Adler developed and refined his technique 
of psychotherapy, which focused on helping clients to under- 
stand themselves clearly and to choose in what way and how 
to make changes in their lives. 
6. Later developments, 1925-37 
In his later writings, Adler attributed an increased importance 
to the creative power of the individual as being the central 
factor in the construction of the 'life style'. This creative power 
was also seen in the shaping of a neurosis. The striving for 
superiority became more significant, and private logic is de- 
fined as being the opposite of community feeling. The feeling 
of inferiority came to be seen as no longer a neurotic symptom, 
but the most essential feature of a human being, and Adler 
emphasized a person's tendency to move from a state of 
inferiority to one of superiority.

Adler: 'A Man Ahead of his Time' 
Born a Hungarian citizen in 1870, Adler received his medical 
degree from the University of Vienna in 1895 and already had a 
publication to his name when he met Freud in 1902. From 1902 
till 1911 Adler belonged to the Psychoanalytic Society of which 
he had been one of the first four members, even acting as president 
in 1910. 191 1 was a significant year for Adler; he became an 
Austrian citizen, resigned from the Viennese Psychoanalytic So- 
ciety and founded the Society for Free Psychoanalysis, which 
became the Society for Individual Psychology. 191 1 was also the 
year of the major split from Freud and the year in which Adler 
read Vaihinger's Philosophy of the As If, which provided him 
with a new conceptual framework for his own system. During and 
after the First World War, Adler's socialist opinions became clear 
in his publications and in the way he worked on his own ideas. 
The early 1920s saw him involved in institutions in which a 
form of therapeutic education was organized. This early form of 
social medicine or multiple therapy was seen as most effective and 
Adler was active in no less than twenty-six schools by 1929. While 
these institutions were abolished in Vienna in 1934, the idea had 
been born and the concepts of group therapy and community 
psychiatry are clearly recognized as having their roots in Adler's 
thought and work. Indeed the first day hospital and the first 
self-governed social therapeutic club were developed in England 
by Dr. Joshua Bierer, one of Adler's disciples. In the late '20s and 
early '30s, Adler was concerned with systematizing his ideas. He

underlines the importance of our creativity in the development of 
our life styles, and he gave increased emphasis to the striving for 
superiority or the growth principle. This is an innate movement 
and is a development of Adler's concept of power. Power has been 
grossly misrepresented as meaning power over other people; on 
the contrary, Adlerians mean power within self used to overcome 
certain aspects of self. In other words, a movement towards 
self-improvement and community enrichment. 
In the last ten years of his life, Adler's development was more 
towards the transpersonal. Whereas his early medical career had 
given birth to the concept of organ inferiority, he moved through 
social inferiority to a more encompassing humanistic system, a 
feature of which was a joint book with a Lutheran pastor, Dr. 
Ernst Jahn, in which the cure of souls and Individual Psychology

theory of the 'masculine protest' is said to be based). We also see 
a tremendous awareness of illness and death, themes which recur 
in most of his own memories. 
Indeed, Adler's first memory contains many elements of his 
psychology: 'I remember sitting on a bench bandaged up on 
account of rickets, with my healthy elder brother sitting opposite 
me. He could run, jump and move about quite effortlessly, while 
for me, movement of any sort was a strain and an effort. Everyone 
went to great pains to help me and my mother and father did all 
that was in their power to do.' While we cannot but guess what 
the memory might mean exactly, we can assume that the themes 
of being an observer, understanding physical inferiority, compar- 
ing oneself with others, helping people, and kindness are signifi- 
cant life-themes to this person. Interesting is another of Adler's 
memories, which ends with the reflection: 'There's another who's 
had a bad time at the hands of a doctor. But I shall be a real 
doctor.' Here we can see a conclusion - a goal - which attracted 
Adler all his life. Two further memories bear a resemblance to key 
concepts of Individual Psychology. The first is where he hears a 
song which describes how people say one thing but do another, 
thus indicating an early interest in the difference between people's 
words and their deeds. The other memory is where he faces up to 
his 'fear of death' by running through a cemetery; this parallels 
the importance of courage in overcoming a perceived weakness 
in oneself.

of a sub-group of three. We would therefore expect him to have 
psychological features typical of a middle or 'sandwich' child: 
always under pressure, trying hard to compete with a bright older 
brother and closely followed by a competitive younger brother. 
The irony is that Adler, who competed with Sigmund Freud for 
most of his career in psychological medicine, had an elder brother 
called Sigmund. 
Individual Psychology in Practice 
Like all other psychologies, Adlerian psychology offers a set of 
tools which can be put to a number of uses. In the next paragraphs 
we concentrate on the applications of Individual Psychology in 
mental health and hygiene. 
The more structured approach to using Individual Psychology 
was systematized by Dreikurs. This 'life style analysis' consists of 
four main stages. The first phase, which continues throughout the 
counselling process, is called the relationship stage. This is where 
the counsellor and client develop a mutually respectful, trusting 
relationship with a clear purpose and working agreement. The 
second phase is the collection of data, both about the problem 
itself and the purpose of the counselling process, and about the 
client's life style (see chapters 1 and 4). The material gathered here 
is generally the family constellation and the childhood memories 
(chapter 5). The third phase is the disclosure of the private logic, 
in which the counsellor connects the problem with the client's 
belief system (chapters 2, 7, 10 and 11). The final stage is 
understanding 
life 
of a sub-group of three. We would therefore expect him to have 
psychological features typical of a middle or 'sandwich' child: 
always under pressure, trying hard to compete with a bright older 
brother and closely followed by a competitive younger brother.

we concentrate on the applications of Individual Psychology in 
mental health and hygiene. 
The more structured approach to using Individual Psychology 
was systematized by Dreikurs. This 'life style analysis' consists of 
four main stages. The first phase, which continues throughout the 
counselling process, is called the relationship stage. This is where 
the counsellor and client develop a mutually respectful, trusting 
relationship with a clear purpose and working agreement. The 
second phase is the collection of data, both about the problem 
itself and the purpose of the counselling process, and about the 
client's life style (see chapters 1 and 4). The material gathered here 
is generally the family constellation and the childhood memories 
(chapter 5). The third phase is the disclosure of the private logic, 
in which the counsellor connects the problem with the client's 
belief system (chapters 2, 7, 10 and 11). The final stage is

variously called 're-education' (which reflects the importance of 
education in Individual Psychology) or 're-orientation'. This 
phase includes the growth of the client's self-esteem (encourage- 
ment) and an increased awareness of others. 
A less structured and more regularly practised approach is one 
where the life style information is either offered by the client 'by the 
way', or informally requested by the counsellor, i.e. using the infor- 
mation as it comes up rather than as part of a particular frame- 
work which might not suit the client and the presenting problem. 
How does Individual Psychology help people to get better? 
Adler himself says: 'The actual change in the nature of the patient 
can only be his own doing. I have found it most profitable to sit 
ostentatiously with my hands in my lap, fully convinced that no 
matter what I might be able to say on the point, the patient can 
learn nothing from me that he, as the sufferer, does not under- 
stand better, once he has recognised his lifeline.' 
'From the very beginning the consultant must try to make it 
clear that the responsibility for his cure is the patient's business, 
for as the English proverb very rightly says: "You can lead a horse 
to water, but you can't make him drink." One should always look 
at the treatment and the cure not as the success of the consultant, 
but as the success of the patient. The adviser can only point out 
the mistakes, it is the patient who must make the truth living.' 
(Ansbacher 1964, p. 336).

Psychology in counselling and therapy, it is also widely used 
in education and in organizational work: the principles are the

following shows. 
Therapeutic Education 
Individual Psychology is unusual in that it is a particularly 
educational model of psychology, a fact which forms an integral 
aspect of its application to counselling and psychotherapy. Chapter 
8 in this book reflects Adler's keen personal interest in this subject. 
As early as 1904 (two years after he had met Freud), Adler 
wrote a lengthy article in which he developed a complete theory 
of education (Ansbacher, 1969). In this article, 'The Physician as 
Educator', Adler puts across four major ideas: the development 
of self-confidence in the child, the use of natural consequences as 
a disciplinary method, that a child should have no fear of her 
teacher and that children should be educated for community 
living. These ideas represent the essence of what was to become 
Individual Psychology. 
Ellenberger (p. 589) tells us that in 1920 Adler went on to 
found and develop institutions which were increasingly influ- 
enced by Individual Psychology philosophy and practice. Further 
(p. 621), that in the same year Adler felt that the main effort in 
therapeutic education should be aimed towards teachers. He 
organized what we would today refer to as supervision, but with 
consultations with the parent, the child and the teacher as part of 
the process. As popularity and recognition for this approach grew,

This structure and method is still used in Adlerian Open Family 
Counselling today. 
A new high point in therapeutic education was reached in 
1931, when an experimental school was opened in Vienna. 
Important features of this school's functioning included the de- 
velopment of community spirit, mutual aid amongst the children, 
individual consultations for pupils who needed them and a 
monthly meeting of parents and teachers. Sadly this particular 
school was closed, due to a change in the political climate, in 
1934. Nonetheless, Adler's ideas continue to have a place in 
education today, particularly in the United States.

Only a science that is directly related to life, said the great 
philosopher William James, is really a science. It might also be 
said that in a science directly related to life, theory and practice 
become almost inseparable. Such a science, precisely because it 
models itself on the dynamics of life, becomes a science of living. 
These considerations apply especially strongly to the science of 
Individual Psychology. 
Individual Psychology attempts to see individual lives as a 
whole, and regards each single reaction, each action and impulse 
as an expression of an individual's attitude towards life. Such a 
science is of necessity practical and pragmatic, for with the aid of 
knowledge we can change and correct our attitudes. Individual

Psychology thus not only predicts what will happen, but, like the 
prophet Jonah, it predicts what might happen in order that it does 
not happen. 
The science of Individual Psychology developed out of an effort 
to understand the mysterious creative power of life - the power 
expressed in the desire to develop, to strive and to achieve, and 
to compensate for defeats in one area by striving for success in 
another. This power is teleological - it expresses itself in the 
striving for a goal, and in this striving every physical and psycho- 
logical attribute co-operates. It is absurd, therefore, to study 
either physical or mental conditions abstractly without relating 
them to the individual as a whole. 
For example, in criminal psychology we often pay more 
attention to the crime than to the criminal. But it is the criminal, 
not the crime, who counts, and no matter how much we con- 
template the criminal act we shall never understand its nature 
unless we see it as an episode in the life of a particular individual. 
The important thing is to understand the context for the indi- 
viduals involved - the goal of their lives which directs all their 
actions and impulses. If we can understand this goal, we can 
understand the hidden meaning behind each separate act - we 
see them as parts of a whole. And when we study the parts - 
provided we study them as parts of a whole - we get a better 
sense of the whole.

Striving Towards a Goal 
My interest in psychology developed out of my medical prac- 
tice. Medicine provided the teleological or purposive viewpoint 
necessary for the understanding of psychological manifesta- 
tions. In the body, all organs strive to develop towards definite 
goals; they have precise forms to be achieved upon maturity. 
Moreover, in cases where there are physical defects we always 
find nature making special efforts to overcome the deficiency, 
or else to compensate for it by developing another organ to 
take over the functions of the defective one. Life always seeks 
for survival, and the life force never yields to external obstacles 
without a struggle. 
Now, psychological developments are analogous to organic 
ones. Each mind forms a conception of a goal or ideal, a means 
to get beyond the present state and to overcome present deficien- 
cies or difficulties by formulating a particular aim for the future. 
By means of this particular aim or goal, individuals can think and 
feel themselves superior to present difficulties because they have 
future success in mind. Without this sense of a goal, individual 
activity would be meaningless. 
All evidence points to the fact that the fixing of this goal must 
take place early in life, during the formative period of childhood. 
A prototype or model of a mature personality begins to develop 
at this time. We can imagine how the process takes place.

situations they cannot bear. Hence they strive to develop, and to 
do so in a direction fixed by the goal they have formulated. It is 
difficult to say how this goal is fixed, but it is obvious that such 
a goal exists and that it dominates a child's every action. Indeed, 
little is understood about impulse, reason, ability or disability in 
early childhood. As yet there is really no key to understanding, 
for the direction is definitely established only after children have 
fixed their goals. Only when we see the direction in which a life 
is tending can we guess what steps will be taken in the future. 
To have a goal is to aspire to be like God. But to be like God 
is of course the ultimate goal, and educators should be cautious 
in attempting to educate themselves and their children to want 
to be like God. Children substitute a more concrete and imme- 
diate goal and look for the strongest person around them to make 
into their model or the embodiment of their goal. It may be the 
father, or perhaps the mother, or any other person. When children 
conceive such a goal they attempt to behave, feel and dress like 
the person they have perceived to be powerful and take on all 
the characteristics consistent with their goal. Later on the ideal 
to be reached may be embodied in the doctor or the teacher, for 
the teacher can punish the child and thus he arouses respect as 
a strong person, and the goal of being a doctor is fashioned 
around the God-like desire of being a master over life and death. 
Here the goal is constructive because it can be realized through 
service to society.

Ways of Seeing the World 
When the prototype - that early personality embodying a goal - 
is formed, the individual becomes oriented towards a certain 
direction. This enables us to predict what will happen later in life. 
Individuals' apperceptions are from then on likely to fall into the 
pattern they have established for themselves. Children will per- 
ceive situations according to personal schemes of apperception - 
that is to say, they will see the world through the prejudice of their 
own goals and interests. 
At four or five years of age, the prototype is already built up, 
and so to understand it we have to look for impressions made on 
children before or during that time. These impressions can be 
quite varied, far more varied than we imagine from an adult's 
point of view. 
It has been discovered that children with physical defects 
connect all their experiences with the functioning of the defective 
organ. For example, children with stomach trouble show an 
abnormal interest in eating, while those with defective eye-sight 
are more preoccupied with visible things. This preoccupation is 
in keeping with the private scheme of apperception which, we 
have said, characterizes everyone. It might be suggested, there- 
fore, that in order to find out where a child's interest lies we need 
only ascertain which organ is defective, but things do not work 
out quite so simply. Children do not necessarily experience physi- 
cal handicaps or deficiencies in the way that an external observer

sees them, but will have their experience of them modified by their 
own scheme of apperception. While the fact of organ inferiority 
counts as an element in the child's scheme of apperception 
therefore, external observation does not necessarily give the key 
to the scheme of apperception. 
The child sees everything in a scheme of relativity, which is 
unavoidable - none of us is blessed with knowledge of the 
absolute truth. We all make mistakes, but the important thing is 
that we can correct them. Such correction is easier as our person- 
alities are forming. But when we do not correct them at that time, 
we may correct the mistakes later on by recalling the situation 
where they arose. Thus if we are confronted with the task of 
treating a neurotic patient, our problem is to discover, not the 
ordinary mistakes he makes in later life, but the fundamental 
mistakes made early in his life when he was formulating his 
prototype. If we discover these mistakes, it is possible to correct 
them by appropriate treatment. 
Individual Psychology, therefore, does not emphasize genetic 
inheritance. It is not what one has inherited that is important, but 
what one does with this inheritance in one's early years - that is 
to say, the prototype that is built up in childhood. Heredity is of 
course responsible for inherited physical defects, but our problem 
there is simply to treat the specific problem and remove the child's 
disadvantage as much as possible.

already more interested in themselves than in others, and they 
tend to continue to be so later in life. Organic inferiority is far 
from being the only cause of mistakes in the prototype: other 
situations may cause the same mistakes - for example, being a 
spoilt or unwanted child. These situations are discussed further 
later in this book. Such children grow up handicapped in that 
they constantly fear attack and have never learned independence. 
Parental Influences 
Our next task is to find out the difficulties that confront 
individuals in their development. In the case of spoilt children, 
neither society nor their families can continue the pampering 
process indefinitely, so pampered children are very soon con- 
fronted with life's problems. At school, they find themselves in 
a new social institution, with a new social problem. They do 
not want to work or play with other children, because they 
have not been prepared for the communal life of the school. In 
fact their experiences at the prototype stage have made them 
afraid of such situations and make them always seek more 
pampering. The characteristics of such individuals are not 
inherited, for we can deduce them from the nature of their 
prototypes and goals. Because they have the particular charac- 
teristics conducive to their particular goals, it is not possible 
for them to have characteristics tending in any other direction.

excessive punishment or abuse. This makes the child strive for a 
sense of release, and sometimes this is expressed in an attitude of 
psychological exclusion. Thus we find that some girls who have 
bad-tempered fathers avoid all men because they believe they are 
ill-tempered. Or boys who suffered under severe mothers may 
exclude women from their lives. This exclusion may of course be 
variously expressed: for instance, a child may simply become shy 
in the company of women, or he may become homosexual. Such 
processes are not inherited, but arise from the environment 
surrounding the child in the early years. 
Children's early mistakes are costly, but despite this fact they 
receive little guidance. Parents do not know or will not confess to 
children the results of their own experiences, and so children must 
follow their own line. 
And while we are on the subject it cannot be overemphasized 
that nothing is gained with children by punishing, admonishing 
and preaching. Nothing is achieved when neither the child nor 
the adult is clear about what is wrong and what should be done 
to put it right. When children do not understand, they become 
sly and cowardly. Their prototypes, moreover, cannot be changed 
by punishment or preaching. Neither can it be changed by mere 
experience of life, for the experience of life is always perceived 
in accordance with a personal scheme of apperception. It is only 
when we have access to the basic building blocks of personality 
that we can make any changes.

surrounding the child in the early years. 
Children's early mistakes are costly, but despite this fact they 
receive little guidance. Parents do not know or will not confess to 
children the results of their own experiences, and so children must 
follow their own line. 
And while we are on the subject it cannot be overemphasized 
that nothing is gained with children by punishing, admonishing 
and preaching. Nothing is achieved when neither the child nor 
the adult is clear about what is wrong and what should be done 
to put it right. When children do not understand, they become 
sly and cowardly. Their prototypes, moreover, cannot be changed 
by punishment or preaching. Neither can it be changed by mere 
experience of life, for the experience of life is always perceived 
in accordance with a personal scheme of apperception. It is only 
when we have access to the basic building blocks of personality 
that we can make any changes.

Birth Order 
It is important to note that no two children, even those born 
in the same family, grow up in the same situation. Even within 
the same family the atmosphere that surrounds individual 
children is quite unique. First children are initially alone and 
are thus the centre of attention. Once the second child is born, 
elder children find themselves dethroned and do not like the 
change of situation; they were once in power and are so no 
longer. This sense of tragedy goes into the formation of their 
prototypes and will re-emerge in their adult characteristics. 
Case histories show that such children nearly always suffer a 
downfall in adult life. 
Another factor is to be found in the different treatment meted 
out during the upbringing of boys and girls. Often boys are 
overvalued and girls are regarded as if it is unlikely that they will 
accomplish anything. Girls treated in this way will grow up 
always hesitant and doubting themselves. Throughout life they 
will remain under the impression that only men are able to 
accomplish anything worthwhile. 
The position of second children is also characteristic and 
individual. They are in an entirely different position from that of 
first children because for them there is always someone else setting

development. The older children become frightened by the com- 
petition and do not do so well. They sink more and more in the 
estimation of their parents, who begin to appreciate the second 
child more and more. On the other hand, second children always 
have a pacemaker, and are always in a race. All their charac- 
teristics will reflect this peculiar position in the family. They tend 
to be rebellious and do not recognize power or authority. 
History and legend recount numerous examples of powerful 
youngest children. The biblical story of Joseph is a case in point: 
he wanted to overcome all the others. The fact that a younger 
brother was born into the family unknown to him years after he 
left home obviously does not alter the situation; his position 
remained that of the youngest. We find the same thing in many 
fairy tales, in which the youngest child plays a leading role. These 
characteristics originate in early childhood and cannot be changed 
until greater insight is attained. In order to help people you must 
make them understand what happened in their early childhood. 
They must understand that the prototype they have developed is 
a harmful influence on their lives. 
Exploring Child hood Memories 
A valuable tool for understanding the prototype and hence the 
nature of the individual is the study of childhood memories. All

stomach, let us say. Their earliest memories will probably in some 
way concern food. Or take children who experienced problems 
because they were left-handed: their left-handedness will likewise 
affect their viewpoint. A person may tell you about his mother 
who pampered him, or about the birth of a younger child. He may 
tell you how he was beaten, if he had a bad-tempered father, or how 
he was ridiculed or bullied at school. All such indications are very 
valuable provided we learn the art of reading their significance. 
The art of understanding childhood memories involves a very 
high degree of empathy, the ability to identify oneself with 
children in their childhood situation. It is through such empathy 
that we can understand the unique significance in a child's life of 
the arrival of a younger child in the family, or the impression made 
on a child's mind by the abuse of an ill-tempered father. 
Private Logic 
If we observe a family with badly developed children, we shall 
see that though they may all seem to be intelligent (in the sense 
that if you ask a question they give the right answer), they have 
a strong feeling of inferiority. Intelligence, of course, is not 
necessarily common sense. The children may have an entirely 
personal - what we might term a private - mental attitude of 
the sort that one finds among neurotic persons. In a compulsion 
neurosis, for instance, patients realize the futility of their 
compulsive behaviour but cannot stop it. Private understanding 
and a private language are also characteristic of the insane,

who never speak in the language of common sense, which 
represents the height of social interest. 
If we contrast the judgement of common sense with private 
logic, we shall find that the judgement of common sense is usually 
nearer the truth. We use common sense to distinguish between 
good and bad, and while we often make mistakes in a complicated 
situation, the mistakes tend to correct themselves. But those who 
are always looking out for their own private interests cannot 
distinguish between right and wrong as readily as others. In fact 
they often betray this inability, since all their actions are trans- 
parent to the observer. 
Consider how crimes are committed. If we inquire about the 
intelligence, the understanding and the motive of criminals, we 
shall find that they always looks upon their crimes as both clever 
and heroic. They believe that they have achieved a goal of 
superiority - namely, that they have been more clever than the 
police and are able to get the better of others. They are thus 
heroes in their own minds, and do not see that their actions 
indicate something quite different, something very far from 
heroic. Their lack of social interest, which makes all their activity 
harmful or socially useless, is connected with a lack of courage, 
with cowardice, but they do not know this. Those who turn to 
the useless side of life are often afraid of failure, darkness and 
isolation; they wish to be with others. This is cowardice and

would be to convince everybody that crime is nothing but an 
expression of cowardice. 
It is well known that some criminals, when they approach the 
age of thirty or forty, will change their ways; they will take a job, 
marry and become good citizens. Why? Consider burglars. How 
can forty-year-old burglars compete with twenty-year-old bur- 
glars? The latter are quicker and more powerful. Moreover, at 
the age of thirty or forty criminals are forced to live differently 
from the way they lived before, so, because it does not bring them 
the things they need, crime no longer pays and they find it 
convenient to retire. 
Another fact to be borne in mind in connection with criminals 
is that if we make punishments more severe, far from frightening 
individual criminals we merely help to reinforce their belief that 
they are heroes. We must not forget that criminals live in a 
self-centred world, a world in which one will never find true 
courage, self-confidence, a sense of community, or understanding 
of common values. It is not possible for people in this state to play 
a useful role in society. Neurotics seldom start a club, and this 
would be an impossible feat for persons suffering from agorapho- 
bia or for the criminally insane. Problem children rarely make 
friends - a fact for which the reason is seldom given. There is a 
reason, however: they rarely make friends because their early life 
took a self-centred direction. Their prototypes were oriented 
towards false goals and a private system of logic, so they followed 
a direction leading to the negative side of life.

understanding l i f e  
The Importance of Social Interest 
The concept of social interest or social feeling is a vital one. It is 
the most important part of our education, of our treatment and 
of our cure. Only people who are courageous, self-confident and 
at home in the world can benefit from both the problems and the 
advantages of life. They are never afraid. They know that there 
are always difficulties in life, but they also know that they can 
overcome them. They are prepared for all life's problems, which 
are invariably of a social nature. 
The three types of children we have mentioned develop a 
prototype with a lesser degree of social interest. They do not have 
the mental attitude necessary for the solution of life's difficulties. 
Feeling defeated, they develop a mistaken attitude towards the 
problems of life. Our task in treating such patients is to encourage 
what I describe as 'useful' social behaviour and a positive, or 
'useful', attitude towards life and society. 
Lack of social interest tends to orientate people towards the 
negative, or 'useless' side of life. Individuals who seriously lack 
social interest may become delinquents, criminals, alcoholics, or 
mentally ill. Our problem in their case is to find a means to 
influence them to adopt useful and constructive behaviour pat- 
terns and to make them interested in others. It may be said, 
therefore, that our so-called Individual Psychology is actually a 
social psychology.

Feelings and Emotions 
The next step in the science of living lies in the study of the 
feelings. Not only does the adoption of a goal affect individual 
characteristics, physical movements and expressions, it also domi- 
nates the life of the feelings. It is a remarkable thing that individu- 
als always try to justify their attitudes by an appeal to their 
feelings. Thus if individuals are keen to do good work, we will 
find this idea magnified and playing a dominant role in their 
whole emotional life. Individuals' feelings always agree with their 
viewpoint of their task: the feelings strengthen their assumptions. 
We always do what we would do anyway, and our feelings are 
simply an accompaniment to our acts. 
We can see this quite clearly in dreams, the study of which is 
perhaps one of the greatest achievements of Individual Psychology. 
Every dream has a purpose, although this was never clearly 
understood before. The purpose of a dream, in general, is to create 
a certain feeling or emotion, which in turn furthers the object of the 
dream. We dream in the way that we would like to behave. Dreams 
are an emotional rehearsal of plans and attitudes for our waking 
behaviour - a rehearsal, however, for which the actual play may 
never come off. In this sense dreams are deceptive - the emotional 
imagination gives us the thrill of action without the action. 
This characteristic is also found in our waking life. We always 
have a strong inclination to deceive ourselves emotionally - we 
always want to persuade ourselves to go the way dictated by our 
prototypes, as they were formed in early childhood.

Consciousness and Unconsciousness 
The use of the terms 'consciousness' and 'unconsciousness' to 
designate distinctive entities is considered incorrect in Individual 
Psychology. The conscious and the unconscious mind work to- 
gether in the same direction and are not in opposition or in 
conflict, as is so often believed. What is more, there is no definite 
line of demarcation between them. The important thing is to 
discover the purpose of their joint efforts. It is impossible to decide 
on what is conscious and what is not until the whole context has 
been understood. This is revealed in the prototype, that pattern 
of life that we analysed in the last chapter.

old, suffered from a constant desire to jump out of the window. He 
was always struggling against this desire, but aside from this prob- 
lem he was quite healthy. He had friends, a good job, and lived 
happily with his wife. His case is inexplicable except in terms of a 
collaboration between consciousness and unconsciousness. 
Consciously, he had the feeling that he must jump out of a 
window. Nonetheless he carried on with his life, and in fact never 
even attempted to jump out of a window. The reason for this 
phenomenon is that there was another side to his life, a side in 
which a struggle against his desire to commit suicide played an 
important part. As a result of the collaboration between this 
unconscious side of his being and his consciousness, he came out 
victorious. In fact, in terms of his 'life style' - to use a term we 
will discuss in more detail in a later chapter - he was a conqueror 
who had attained the goal of superiority. 
The reader might ask: How could this man feel superior when 
he had this conscious longing to commit suicide? The answer is 
that there was something in him that was fighting a battle against 
his suicidal tendency. His success in this battle made him a 
conqueror and a superior being. To an objective observer it is 
clear that his struggle for superiority was conditioned by his own 
weakness, as is very often the case with persons who in one way 
or another feel inferior. But the important thing is that in his own 
private battle his striving for superiority, his striving to live and 
to conquer, came out ahead of his sense of inferiority and desire 
to die - and this despite the fact that the latter was expressed in 
his conscious life and the former in his unconscious life.

the inferiority complex 
Let us see if the development of this man's prototype bears out 
our theory; let us analyse his childhood memories. At an early 
age, we learn, he disliked school. He feared other boys and wanted 
to run away from them. Nonetheless, he mustered all his deter- 
mination to stay and face them. Here we can already perceive an 
effort on his part to overcome his own weakness - he faced up to 
his problem and conquered it. 
If we analyse our patient's character, we see that his one aim 
in life was to overcome fear and anxiety. In this aim his conscious 
ideas co-operated with his unconscious ones to form a united 
whole. Now, someone who does not view the human being as a 
unity might see this patient only as an ambitious person who 
wanted to struggle and fight but who was at bottom a coward. 
This would be a misplaced view, however, since it would not take 
into account all the facts in the case and interpret them with regard 
to the fundamental unity of a human life. Our whole psychology 
and all our attempts to understand individuals are futile and 
useless unless we acknowledge that the human being is a unity. If 
we presuppose two sides to each person, having no relation to one 
another, it is impossible to see life as a coherent entity. 
Our Social Rela tionships 
In addition to regarding an individual's life as a unity, we must 
also examine it in its context of social relationships. When human 
beings are first born they are weak, and their weakness makes it 
necessary for others to care for them. The pattern of children's

could never be understood if we confined our analysis to children 
as a separate entities. Children's individuality is made up of more 
than their physical individuality; it involves a whole network of 
social relationships. 
What applies to children applies also, to a certain extent, 
to all of us. The weakness that makes it necessary for children 
to live in a family group is paralleled by the weakness that 
drives people to live in communities. Everyone feels inade- 
quate in certain situations. They feel overwhelmed by the 
difficulties of life and incapable of meeting them single- 
handed. Hence one of the strongest tendencies in humanity 
has been the movement to form groups in order to live as 
members of a community and not as isolated individuals. This 
social life has without doubt been a great help to us in over- 
coming our feelings of inadequacy and inferiority. 
In animals, too, the weaker species always live in groups so 
that their combined powers might help to meet their individual 
needs. Thus a herd of buffalo can defend themselves against 
wolves, whereas one buffalo alone would find this impossible. On 
the other hand gorillas, lions and tigers can live in isolation 
because nature has given them the means of self-protection. A 
human being does not have their great strength, their claws, or 
their teeth, and so cannot live apart; the beginning of social life 
lies, therefore, in the weakness of the individual.

the inferiority complex 
Because of this, we cannot expect to find that the abilities of 
all human beings are equal. But a society that is organized 
appropriately will support the varying abilities of the individuals 
it encompasses. This is an important point to grasp, since other- 
wise we would be led to suppose that individuals have to be judged 
entirely on their inherited abilities. As a matter of fact individuals 
who might be deficient in certain faculties if they lived in an 
isolated condition could well compensate for their shortcomings 
in a well-organized society that encouraged them to contribute 
their particular skills. 
Let us suppose that our individual insufficiencies are inherited. 
If so, it becomes the aim of psychology to help people to live well 
with others, in order to decrease the effect of their natural 
setbacks. The history of social progress is the story of how people 
have co-operated in order to overcome deficiencies and problems. 
Language and Communication 
Everybody realizes that language is a social invention, but few 
people acknowledge that individual deficiency was the mother of 
that invention. This truth, however, is illustrated in the early 
behaviour of children. When their desires are not being satisfied, 
they want to gain attention and they try to do so by some sort of 
language. If children did not need to gain attention, they would 
not try to speak at all. In the first few months of life, the child's 
mother supplies everything that the child wishes, before speech 
develops. There are cases on record of children who did not speak

until they were six years of age because it was never necessary for 
them to do so. 
The same truth is illustrated in the case of a particular child of 
deaf and dumb parents. When he fell and hurt himself he cried, 
but he cried without noise. He knew that noise would be useless 
as his parents could not hear him. Therefore he made the appear- 
ance of crying in order to gain the attention of his parents, but it 
was silent. 
We see, therefore, that we must always look at the whole social 
context of the facts we study. We must look at the social 
environment in order to understand the particular 'goal of 
superiority' individuals choose, and their particular social 
problem. Individual Psychology therefore examines all problems 
against the background in which they occur. Many people have 
difficulty adjusting to society because they find it impossible to 
make normal contact with others by means of language. People 
with speech impediments are an example. If we examine people 
with this problem we shall see that from childhood they were not 
well adjusted socially; they rarely wanted to join in activities, or 
to have friends or companions. Language development needs 
association with others, but since they were unwilling to 
associate, their speech problems continued. There are really two 
impulses in people with speech problems - one that makes them 
want to associate with others, and another that drives them to 
seek isolation.

tendency to stage fright. This is because they regard their audi- 
ences as enemies. They have a feeling of inferiority when con- 
fronted by a seemingly hostile and dominating audience. Only 
when people trust themselves and their audience can they speak 
well, and only then will they not have stage fright. 
Social Training 
The feeling of inferiority and the problem of social training are 
thus intimately connected. The feeling of inferiority arises from 
social maladjustment, while social training is the basic method by 
which we can all overcome our feelings of inferiority. 
There is also a direct connection between social training and 
common sense. When we speak of common sense, we have in 
mind the pooled intelligence of the social group. On the other 
hand, as mentioned in the last chapter, people who use a private 
language and a private understanding demonstrate that other 
people, social institutions and social norms hold no appeal for 
them. And yet it is through these things that the road to their 
salvation lies. 
In working with such people our task is to make community 
life appeal to them. Nervous people always feel justified if they 
show goodwill, but more than goodwill is needed. We must teach 
them that it is what they actually accomplish, what they finally 
give, that matters to society.

that everyone is equal. There are differences in bodily strength, in 
health, and in external circumstances. For that reason different 
mistakes are made by individuals in apparently similar conditions. 
If we examine children we see that there is no single absolutely 
fixed and right manner for them to respond to their circum- 
stances. They respond in their own individual ways. They strive 
towards a better life style, but they all strive in their own way, 
making their own mistakes and using their own approximations 
of success. 
Overcoming Limitations 
Let us analyse some of the variations and peculiarities individuals 
can demonstrate. Let us take, for example, left-handed children. 
There are children who may never know that they are left-handed 
because they have been so carefully trained in the use of the right 
hand. At first they are clumsy with their right hand, and they are 
scolded and criticized. 
Left-handed children can be recognized in the cradle because 
their left hands move more than their right. In later life, they may 
feel burdened by the weakness of their right hand, and in the effort 
to overcome this problem often develop a greater interest in 
drawing, writing, and so on. This is often a great advantage in 
developing latent artistic talent and ability, and children in such 
a position are often ambitious and fight to overcome their limi- 
tations. Sometimes, however, if the struggle is a serious one, they 
may become envious of others and thus develop a greater feeling

the inferiority complex 
of inferiority. Through constant struggling children may turn into 
combative adults, always striving with the fixed idea in mind that 
they ought not to be awkward and found wanting. 
Children strive, make mistakes, and develop in different ways 
according to the prototypes they formed in the first four or five 
years of life. Each of them will have a different goal. Some may 
want to be painters, while others may wish themselves away from 
this world in which they are uncomfortable. We may know how 
they can overcome their weakness, but they do not, and all too 
often the facts are not explained to them in the right way. 
Many children have imperfect eyes, ears, lungs or stomachs, 
and we find their interest stimulated in the direction of the 
imperfection. An interesting example of this is seen in the case of 
a man who suffered from attacks of asthma only when he came 
home from the office at night. He was forty-five, married, and 
had a good job. He was asked why the attacks always occurred 
after he came home from work. He explained, 'You see, my wife 
is very materialistic whereas I am idealistic, so we do not always 
agree. When I come home I would like to relax, to enjoy myself 
quietly at home, but my wife wants to go out and so she complains 
about having to stay at home. Then I get into a bad temper and 
start to suffocate.' 
Why did this man suffocate? Why did he not, for example, 
vomit? The fact is that he was simply being true to his prototype. 
It seems that as a child he had to be bandaged for some weakness 
and this tight binding affected his breathing and made him very 
uncomfortable. He had a nurse, however, who liked him and

would sit beside him and console him. All her interest was focused 
on him rather than on herself. Consequently, she gave him the 
impression that he would always be amused and consoled. When 
he was four years old the nurse went away to a wedding and he 
accompanied her to the station, crying very bitterly. After the 
nurse had left he said to his mother, 'The world no longer has any 
interest for me now that my nurse has gone away.' 
Hence we see him in adulthood just as he was in the early years 
when he was forming his prototype; looking for an ideal person 
who would always amuse him and console him and be interested 
solely in him. His problem lay not in insufficient oxygen, but in 
the fact that he was not being amused and consoled at all times. 
Naturally, to find a person who will always amuse you is not easy. 
He always wanted to control every situation, and to a certain 
degree it helped him when he succeeded. Thus when he started to 
suffocate, his wife stopped wanting to socialize or go to the 
theatre - he had obtained his 'goal of superiority'. 
On the conscious level this man was always right and 
proper, but subconsciously he was driven by the desire to be 
the conqueror. He wanted to make his wife what he called 
idealistic instead of materialistic. We should suspect similar 
behaviour of a man whose true motives are at variance with 
those on the surface.

interest in visual things. It is not uncommon for poets and painters

those of other people, it seems that I was compelled to train and 
use my imagination. I do not know that this has helped me to be 
a great writer, but in any case as a result of my eyesight I can see 
better in my imagination than others can in reality.' 
If we examine the personalities of geniuses we often find poor 
eyesight or some other physical disadvantage. Even the gods of 
mythology had some deficiency such as blindness in one or both 
eyes. The fact that there are geniuses who, even though nearly 
blind, are still able to understand better than others the differences 
in lines, tones and colours shows what can be done with affected 
children if their problems are properly understood. 
Some people are especially interested in food. Because of this 
they are always discussing what they can and cannot eat. Usually 
such people have had digestive problems when they were young 
and so have developed greater interest in food than others. They 
probably had an anxious mother who constantly told them what 
they could and could not eat. Such individuals then have to make an 
effort to overcome their stomach problems, and they become vitally 
interested in what they will have for breakfast, lunch or dinner. As 
a result of their preoccupation with food they sometimes become 
very good cooks or become experts on dietary matters. 
At times, however, a weakness of the stomach or the intestines 
causes people to look for a substitute for eating. Sometimes this 
substitute is money, and such people may become miserly or great 
financiers. They often strive extremely hard to accumulate money, 
training themselves for this purpose day and night. They never

stop thinking of their business -a fact which may sometimes give 
them a great advantage over others in similar circumstances. 
Furthermore, it is interesting to note that we often hear of rich 
men suffering from stomach complaints. 
Let us remind ourselves at this point of the importance of the 
connection between body and mind. A certain defect in different 
people does not always have the same consequences; there is no 
necessary cause-and-effect relationship between a physical defi- 
ciency and a poor way of life. The physical condition can often 
be effectively treated, or at least alleviated, but it is not the defect 
itself that brings bad results: it is the patient's attitude to it that 
is responsible. That is why, for the individual psychologist, mere 
physical causality does not exist, but only mistaken attitudes 
towards physical conditions. Also, that is why the individual 
psychologist seeks to encourage the overcoming of the feeling of 
inferiority during the development of the prototype. 
Sometimes we encounter people who seem permanently impa- 
tient because they cannot wait to overcome their difficulties. 
Whenever we see someone constantly on the go, with a strong 
temper and moods, we can conclude that they have a powerful 
feeling of inferiority. People who believe they can overcome their 
difficulties will not be impatient. 
Arrogant, impertinent, quarrelsome children also indicate a 
great feeling of inferiority. It is our task in their case to look for 
the reasons for the difficulties they are trying to overcome, in 
order to prescribe appropriate treatment. We should never criti- 
cize or punish mistakes in the life style of the prototype.

We can recognize these characteristics within the prototype 
among children in very particular ways - in unusual interests, in 
scheming and striving to outdo others, and in pursuing the goal 
of superiority. There are types that do not trust their own abilities 
to act and express themselves, preferring to exclude other people 
as far as possible. They avoid new situations and try to stay in the 
little circle in which they feel secure. In school, in employment, in 
society and in marriage they do the same, always hoping to 
accomplish much in their own little sphere in order to arrive at a 
goal of superiority. We find this trait quite often among people 
who forget that to accomplish anything worthwhile, one must be 
prepared to face up to whatever life throws at us. If individuals 
rule out certain situations and certain people as impossible, they 
can only use private logic to justify themselves, and this is not 
enough. People need the fresh air of social contact and common 
sense in order to live a healthy life. 
People all face different requirements in their lives. If writers, 
for example, want to achieve something in their work, they cannot 
always go off to lunch or dinner with others, for they need to be 
alone for long periods of time in order to collect their ideas. But 
they must also grow through social interaction because this 
contact is an important part of their development. And so when 
we encounter such people we must remember their two require- 
ments, and also that they can be either socially useful or useless. 
We should therefore look carefully to see the difference between 
useful and useless behaviour.

Feelings of Inferiority 
The key to the social process is the fact that people are always 
striving to find a situation in which they can excel. Thus, children 
who have a strong feeling of inferiority want to exclude bigger 
children and play with the younger or weaker ones whom they can 
dominate. This is an abnormal and pathological expression of the 
feeling of inferiority, for it is important to realize that it is not the 
sense of inferiority itself that matters but its degree and expression. 
An abnormal feeling of inferiority has acquired the name of 
'inferiority complex'. But 'complex' is not the correct word for a 
feeling that permeates the whole personality. It is more than a 
complex; it is almost a disease whose severity varies under different 
circumstances. Thus we sometimes do not notice someone's feeling 
of inferiority when they are at work because they feel sure of their 
ability, but they may not be sure of themselves in the company of 
others, particularly in their relations with the other sex, and there 
we are able to discover their true psychological situation. 
Mistakes are more evident in a tense or difficult situation. The 
prototype appears more clearly when an individual is in a difficult 
or new situation; a difficult situation being more often than not 
a new one. That is why, as we said in the first chapter, the 
expression of a person's degree of social interest becomes evident 
in a new social situation.

interest in seeing whether they mix with their fellow pupils or 
avoid them. If they respond to other children only conditionally

Feelings of Inferiority 
The key to the social process is the fact that people are always 
striving to find a situation in which they can excel. Thus, children 
who have a strong feeling of inferiority want to exclude bigger 
children and play with the younger or weaker ones whom they can 
dominate. This is an abnormal and pathological expression of the 
feeling of inferiority, for it is important to realize that it is not the 
sense of inferiority itself that matters but its degree and expression.

or hesitantly, we must be on the lookout for the same charac- 
teristics being revealed later on in society and marriage. 
These are many people who say, 'I would do that in such-and- 
such a way', 'I would take that job', 'I would take on that man, 
. . . but . . . !' All such statements indicate a strong feeling of 
inferiority, and if we interpret them in this way we get a new 
insight into certain emotions, such as doubt. A person who feels 
in doubt usually remains in doubt and accomplishes nothing. 
The psychologist can often see hesitations and contradictions 
in people, which may be considered signs of a feeling of inferiority, 
but we must also take into account the physical movements of the 
subjects. Their approach, or way of dealing with other people, 
may be poor; perhaps they approach hesitantly or with an awk- 
ward bodily posture. This hesitation will often be expressed in 
other situations in life. Many people habitually take one step 
forward and one step backward - quite literally. 
Our whole task is to train people away from this hesitant 
attitude. The proper treatment is to encourage them - never to 
discourage them. We must make them understand that they are 
capable of facing difficulties and solving the problems of life. This 
is the only way to build self-confidence, and this is the only way 
the feeling of inferiority can be treated.

The Goal of Superiority 
In the last chapter we discussed the inferiority complex and its 
relationship with the general feeling of inferiority that all of us 
share and struggle against. Now we turn to its complement, the 
superiority complex. 
We have seen how every characteristic of an individual's life 
is expressed in a transition - in a progression. Thus the 
characteristic may be said to have a past and a future. The future 
is tied up with our striving and our goal, while the past represents 
the state of inferiority or inadequacy that we are trying to 
overcome. That is why, in the case of an inferiority complex, we 
are interested in its beginning, while in a superiority complex we

are more interested in its progression, in the transition itself. 
Moreover, the two complexes are naturally related. We should 
not be astonished if, in cases where we see an inferiority complex, 
we also find a hidden superiority complex. On the other hand, if 
we inquire into a superiority complex and study its continuity, we 
can always find a more or less concealed inferiority complex. We 
do not strive to be superior and to succeed if we do not feel a 
certain deficiency in our present condition. 
The striving for superiority never ceases. It is essential to the 
mind, to the psyche of the individual. As we have said, life is the 
attainment of a goal or ideal form, and it is the striving for 
superiority that sets it in motion. If we look at lazy children and 
see their lack of activity, their lack of interest in anything, we may 
say that they do not seem to be progressing in any direction. 
Nonetheless, we find in them a desire to be superior, a desire that 
makes them say, 'If I were not so lazy, I could be president'. They 
are progressing and striving conditionally, so to speak. They hold 
a high opinion of themselves and take the view that they could 
accomplish much, if only . . . ! This is self-deception, of course - 
it is fiction, but as we all know, humanity is very often satisfied 
with fiction. And this is especially true of people who lack 
courage. They do not feel very strong and so they always make 
detours around difficulties, always trying to escape them. 
Through this process of escape and evasion they maintain a feeling 
of being much stronger and cleverer than they really are.

Avoiding Real Solutions 
Children who steal suffer from a feeling of superiority. They 
believe they are deceiving others, that others do not know they 
are stealing, and that they have become richer with little effort. 
This same feeling is very pronounced among criminals who have 
the idea that they are heroes. 
We have already spoken of this trait from another point of view, 
as a manifestation of a private logic. It is not common or social 
sense. If murderers think themselves heroic, that is a private idea. 
They are in fact lacking in courage, since they want to arrange 
matters in a way that avoids the necessity of applying real solutions 
to the problems of life. Criminality is thus the expression of a 
superiority complex, not of a fundamental or original wickedness. 
We see similar symptoms appearing in neurotic people. For 
example, they may suffer from insomnia and so do not feel strong 
enough to fulfil the demands of their jobs on the following day. 
Because of their sleepless nights they feel they should not be 
required to work, because they are not up to completing the tasks 
they should accomplish. 'What could I not achieve, if I could only 
get some sleep!' they wail. 
We see this also among depressed people suffering from 
anxiety. Their anxiety turns them into tyrants over others; they 
use it to rule others, for they must always have people around 
them, they must be accompanied wherever they go, and so on. 
Their companions are made to live their whole lives in accordance 
with the needs and demands of the depressed person.

the superiority complex 
Depressed, ill people are always the centre of attention in a 
family. In them we see the power wielded by the inferiority 
complex. They complain that they feel weak, are losing weight, and 
so on, but often they are the strongest of all in that they dominate 
the healthy members of the family. This should not surprise us, for 
in our culture weakness can be quite a powerful weapon. 
Superiority and Inferiority 
Let us study the connection between the superiority complex and 
inferiority. For example, if we study problem children with a sup- 
eriority complex - children who are impertinent and arrogant - we 
shall find that they always want to appear bigger than they are. 
We all know how children with temper tantrums try to control 
others. Why are they so demanding and impatient? Because they 
are not sure they are strong enough to attain their goal - they feel 
inferior. It is as if they were constantly on tiptoes in an effort to 
appear bigger than they really are and thus to gain success, pride 
and superiority. 
We have to find methods of treatment for such children. They 
act in that way because they do not understand the natural order 
of things. We should not censure them, but in a friendly manner 
explain to them the commonsense point of view, and help them 
gradually to understand it. 
If people show off it is only because they feel inferior, and do 
not feel strong enough to compete with others in a more positive 
way. They are not in harmony with society. They are not socially

well adjusted, and do not know how to solve the social problems 
of life. We usually find that there was a struggle between such 
people and their parents and teachers during their childhood. 
We see the same combination of inferiority and superiority 
complexes in neurotic illnesses. Neurotics often express their 
sense of superiority but do not acknowledge their inferiority 
complex. The case history of a girl suffering from compulsion 
neurosis is very illuminating in this regard. 
This young girl was very close to her elder sister, who was very 
charming and popular. This fact is significant, for if one person 
in a family is outstanding in some way, the others will suffer. This 
is always so, whether the favoured individual is the father, one of 
the children, or the mother. A very difficult situation is created 
for the other members of the family, and sometimes they feel they 
cannot bear it. 
The girl in question grew up without the favoured status of her 
sister and felt restricted. If she had been interested in other people, 
and had understood what we now understand, she could have 
followed another path. But she was always suffering from the 
tension of an inferiority complex caused by comparing herself 
with her preferred sister. 
When she was twenty her sister married, and so she began to 
seek marriage herself in order to compete with her sister. She was 
drifting further and further from the healthy, useful side of life. 
She began to develop the idea that she was a wicked person, and 
then the notion that she possessed magic power that could send 
people to hell.

36 

the superiority complex 
We see this feeling of magic power as an expression of a 
superiority complex, but she complained about having this 'gift', 
just as we sometimes hear rich people complain of how hard a 
fate it is to be rich. Not only did she feel that she had the god-like 
power of sending people to hell, but at times she got the 
impression that she could and ought to save these people. By 
means of this fictitious system she assured herself that she 
possessed a power higher than her sister's. Only in this way could 
she overcome her sister. And so she kept complaining that she 
had this power, for the more she complained about it the more 
plausible it would seem that she actually possessed it. Only by 
complaining could she feel happy with her lot. 
The elder sister had been very much favoured, for at one time 
she was the only child, much pampered, and the centre of 
attention. Three years later the arrival of the younger sister 
changed the whole situation for the elder girl. Formerly she had 
always been alone, the centre of attention. Now she was suddenly 
thrown out of this position, and as a result she became an 
aggressive child. But there can be aggression only where there 
are weaker companions, and aggressive children are not really 
courageous - they fight only weaker adversaries. If there is no 
opportunity for this, children may become peevish instead, and 
in either case are therefore likely to be less appreciated at home. 
The elder child then feels she is not as dearly loved as before, 
and sees this as a confirmation of her view about the younger 
child. She considers her mother the most guilty person, inasmuch 
as it is it she who brought the new baby into the home. Thus we

u n d e r s t a n d i n g  l i f e  
can understand her directing her attacks towards her mother. 
The baby, of course, has to be watched and cared for as all 
babies do, and is thus in a favourable position. She does not 
need to exert herself, she does not need to fight. She grows up 
as a very sweet, very soft and dearly loved creature - the centre 
of attention. Sometimes virtue, in the form of sweetness and 
obedience, may conquer! 
Now let us analyse this sweetness and consider whether it was 
on the useful side of life or not. We may suppose that a child will 
be amenable and tractable only as long as she is pampered. When 
pampered children go to school, they are no longer in a favourable 
situation. From that moment on we see them adopting a hesitant 
attitude to life. 
So it was with this younger sister. She began to learn to sew, 
to play the piano, and so on, but in each case, after a short time 
she dropped her efforts to learn. She also began to lose interest in 
society, no longer liked to go out, and suffered from depression. 
She felt herself overshadowed by her elder sister, who had a more 
agreeable personality. Her hesitancy made her become weaker 
and caused a deterioration in her character. 
Later in life she hesitated in deciding on a career and never 
finished any training. She also hesitated in love and marriage, 
despite her desire to compete with her sister. When she reached 
thirty, she decided to marry a man who was suffering from 
tuberculosis. This choice was naturally opposed by her parents. 
In this case, she did not find it necessary to hesitate, for her parents 
prohibited the marriage.

the superiority complex 
A year later she married a man thirty-five years her senior. We 
often find an expression of an inferiority complex in the selection 
of a much older person as a partner, or in the selection of a person 
who is not free to marry. There is always a suspicion of cowardice 
when there are obvious hindrances. But because this girl had not 
justified her feeling of superiority through marriage, she found 
another way of doing so. She began to insist that the most 
important thing in this world was cleanliness. She had to wash 
herself all the time, she said. If anybody or anything touched her, 
she had to wash again. In this way she became wholly isolated. 
Now this all seems like an inferiority complex, but the girl felt 
herself to be the only clean person in the world and was continu- 
ally criticizing and accusing others because they did not have her 
obsession with washing. She had always wanted to be superior, 
and now in her fictitious way she was. She was the cleanest person 
in the world. So we see that her inferiority complex had developed 
into a superiority complex, very distinctly expressed. 
Self-l nterest 
So long as people are interested not only in themselves but in 
others, they will solve the problems of life satisfactorily. But 
if they develop an inferiority complex, they find themselves 
living, as it were, in enemy territory - always looking out for 
their own interests rather than for those of others, and thus 
not having any sense of community. They approach the social

solution, and so, lacking success, they turn to the useless side 
of life. They feel relieved at being supported by others and not 
having to solve problems. 
It seems to be a characteristic of human nature that when 
individuals - either children or adults - feel excessively weak, 
they cease to be interested in others but strive only for supe- 
riority. As long as people striving for personal superiority 
temper their efforts with social interest, they can accomplish 
some good. But if they lack social interest, they are not prepared 
to solve life's problems. 
We see the same phenomenon in megalomaniacs who be- 
lieve themselves to be Jesus Christ or great leaders. Such 
people play their role almost as if it were true. They are 
isolated in life, and we shall find, if we go back to their past, 
that they felt painfully inferior and that, in compensation, they 
developed a superiority complex. 
There is the case of a boy of fifteen who was committed to a 
mental hospital because of his hallucinations. At that time, before 
the First World War, he fancied that the emperor of Austria was 
dead - this was not true, but he claimed that the emperor had 
appeared to him in a dream demanding that he lead the Austrian 
army against the enemy. And he was a small boy! He would not 
be convinced of his error about the emperor's death, even when 
he was shown newspapers reporting on the emperor's activities. 
He insisted that the emperor was dead and had appeared to him

be convinced of his error about the emperor's death, even when 
he was shown newspapers reporting on the emperor's activities. 
He insisted that the emperor was dead and had appeared to him 
in a dream. 
At that time Individual Psychology was trying to find out the 
40 

the s u p e r i o r i t y  complex 
importance of sleeping positions in indicating a person's feeling 
of superiority or inferiority. Some people lie curled up in bed, 
covering their heads with the covers. This expresses an inferiority 
complex. Can we believe such people to be courageous? When 
we see people who stretch out straight, on the other hand, can 
we believe them weak in life? It has also been observed that 
people who sleep on their stomachs tend to be stubborn and 
aggressive. 
This boy was observed in an attempt to find correlations 
between his waking behaviour and his sleeping positions. It was 
found that he slept with his arms crossed on his chest, like some 
caricature of Napoleon. As we all know, pictures generally show 
Napoleon with his arms in such a position. 
Next day the boy was asked, 'Who does this position remind 
you of?' 
He answered, 'My teacher.' 
The discovery was a little disturbing, until it was suggested 
that the teacher might resemble Napoleon. This proved to be the 
case. Moreover, the boy had loved this teacher and wanted to be 
like him. He longed to enter the teaching profession, but for lack 
of funds to pay for an education his family had had to put him to 
work in a restaurant. There the customers had all derided him 
because he was small. He could not bear this and wanted to escape 
from this feeling of humiliation, but he escaped to the useless side 
of life. 
We can understand what happened in the case of this boy. In 
the beginning he had an inferiority complex because he was small.

But he was constantly striving for superiority. He wanted to be a 
teacher, but because he was blocked from attaining this goal he 
found another goal of superiority by making a detour to the 
useless side of life. He became superior in sleep and in 
hallucinations. 
Boasting and Confidence 
The goal of superiority may be pursued by either useless or 
useful activity. If people are benevolent, for instance, it may 
mean one of two things - it may mean that they are socially 
well adjusted and want to help, or it may simply mean that 
they want to show off. 
The psychologist meets many people whose main goal is to 
show off and boast. A similar tendency may be seen in the 
behaviour of criminals -the tendency to claim easy success, which 
we have already discussed. The New York newspapers once 
reported how a burglar was disturbed by some schoolteachers 
after he broke into their home. He had an interesting discussion 
with them. The burglar told the women they did not know how 
difficult it was to earn a living in ordinary, honest occupations; it 
was much easier to be a burglar than to work. This man had 
escaped to the useless side of life, but by taking this road he had 
developed a certain superiority complex. He felt stronger than the 
women, particularly since he was armed and they were not. But 
did he realize that he was a coward? On the contrary, he thought 
himself a hero.

the superiority complex 
Some types turn to suicide and seek to throw off the whole 
world with all its difficulties. They do not seem to care for life 
and so feel superior, although they are really cowards. We see that 
a superiority complex is a secondary development. It is a 
compensation for the inferiority complex. We must always try to 
find the organic connection - the connection that may seem to be 
a contradiction but which is quite in accordance with human 
nature, as we have already shown. Once this connection is found 
we are in a position to treat both the inferiority and superiority 
complexes. 
Hea lthy Amb 
We should not conclude the general subject of inferiority and 
superiority complexes without saying a few words about the 
relationship between these complexes and normal impulses, for 
everyone, as we have said, has a feeling of inferiority. But the 
feeling of inferiority is not a disease, it is a stimulant to healthy, 
normal development. It becomes a pathological condition only 
when the sense of inadequacy overwhelms individuals, and in- 
stead of stimulating them to useful activity, makes them depressed 
and incapable of development. 
The superiority complex is one of the ways people who feel 
inferior try to escape from their difficulties. They persuade 
themselves that they are superior when they are not, and this false 
success compensates them for the state of inferiority that they 
cannot bear.

Normal people do not have a superiority complex; they do 
not even have a sense of superiority; they have ambition to be 
successful, but so long as this striving is constructively ex- 
pressed it does not lead to false values, which lie at the root of 
mental illness.

the life style 
Recognizing Life Style 
A pine tree growing in the valley grows differently from one on 
top of a mountain. The same kind of tree has two distinct life 
styles. Its style on top of the mountain is different from its style 
when growing in the valley. The life style of a tree is the individual 
expression of a tree moulding itself to its environment. We 
recognize a style when we see it set against a background different 
from the one we would expect, for then we realize that every tree 
has its own life pattern and its growth is not merely a mechanical 
reaction to the environment. 
It is much the same with human beings. We see the life 
style under certain conditions and it is our task to analyse its 
exact relation to existing circumstances, inasmuch as the mind 
changes with any alteration in the environment. As long as 
people are in a favourable situation we cannot see their life

styles clearly. In new situations, however, where they are con- 
fronted with difficulties, the life styles appear clearly and 
distinctly. A trained psychologist could perhaps understand a 
life style of a human being even while in a favourable situ- 
ation, but it becomes apparent to everybody when the subject 
is put into unfavourable or difficult circumstances. 
Since life is something more than a game, it is always full of 
difficulties. There are inevitably circumstances in which human 
beings find themselves confronted with problems, and it is while 
subjects are confronted with these difficulties that we must study 
them and find out their different responses and characteristic 
features. As we have said, the life style is a unity because it has 
grown out of the difficulties of early life and out of the striving 
for a goal. 
But we are interested not so much in the past as in the future, 
and in order to understand someone's future we must understand 
their life style. Even if we understand instincts, stimuli, drives, 
and so on, we cannot predict what will happen. Some 
psychologists try to reach conclusions based on observing 
instinctive behaviour or evidence of trauma, but on closer 
examination it will be found that all these elements presuppose a 
consistent life style. Thus whatever stimulus is received, it only 
serves to reinforce a life style. 
We have seen how human beings with physical deficiencies, 
because they face difficulties and feel insecure, suffer from a 
feeling of inferiority. But as human beings cannot endure this for 
long, the inferiority feeling stimulates them, as we have seen, to 
understanding 
life 
styles clearly. In new situations, however, where they are con­

action, and this results in the formulation of a goal. Individual 
Psychology at first called the consistent movement towards this 
goal a plan of life, but because this name sometimes led to 
misunderstanding, it is now called the life style. 
Because individuals have life styles, it is sometimes possible to 
predict their future just on the basis of talking to them and asking 
questions. It is like looking at the fifth act of a drama, where all 
the mysteries are solved. We can make predictions in this way 
because we know the usual phases, difficulties and questions of 
life. Thus, from experience and the knowledge of a few facts we 
can predict what will happen to children who always keep away 
from others, who are looking for support, who are pampered and 
who hesitate in approaching new situations. What happens in the 
case of people whose goal is to be always supported by others? 
Hesitating, they stop seeking or escape from the solution to the 
questions of life. We know that they can hesitate, stop, or escape, 
because we have seen the same thing happen a thousand times. 
We know that they do not want to cope alone but want to be 
pampered, to stay away from the basic problems of life and 
occupy themselves with irrelevant things rather than struggle with 
important matters. They lack social interest, and as a result may 
develop into problem children, neurotics, criminals, or become 
suicidal - the final escape. All these things are now better under- 
stood than formerly. 
We realize, for instance, that in looking for the life style of a 
human being we may use a 'normal' life style as a basis for 
measurement. We use the socially well adjusted human being as 
the life s tyle 
action, and this results in the formulation of a goal. Individual

u n d e r s t a n d i n g  l i f e  
a reference, and we can then measure variations from this 
reierence. 
The 'Normal' Life Style 
At this point perhaps it would be helpful to show how we 
determine the 'normal' life style and how we go on from there to 
recognize mistakes and peculiarities. 
Human beings cannot be divided into types because every 
human being has an individual life style. Just as one cannot find 
two leaves of a tree that are absolutely identical, one cannot find 
two human beings who are absolutely alike. Nature is so rich, 
and the possibilities for stimuli are so numerous, that it is not 
possible for two persons to be identical. If we speak of types, 
therefore, it is only as an intellectual device to identify the 
similarities between individuals. We can draw clearer conclusions 
if we postulate an intellectual classification and study its special 
peculiarities, but in doing so we do not commit ourselves to using 
the same classification at all times; we use the classification that 
is most useful for bringing out a particular similarity. People who 
take types and classifications too seriously tend to put people in 
pigeon-holes and then fail to see how they can be put into any 
other classification. 
An illustration will make my point clear. When we speak of a 
type of individual who is not socially well adjusted, we mean one 
who leads an unproductive life without any social interest. This 
is one way of classifying individuals, and perhaps it is the most 
understanding 
life 
a reference, and we can then measure variations from this 
reference.

determine the 'normal' life style and how we go on from there to 
recognize mistakes and peculiarities.

important way. But consider the individual whose interest, how- 
ever limited, is centred on visual things. Such a person differs 
entirely from one whose interests are largely concentrated on 
things oral, but both of them may have difficulty in social 
situations and find it difficult to establish contact with their fellow 
human beings. The classification by types can thus be a source of 
confusion if we do not realize that types are merely convenient 
abstractions. 
Let us now consider the people who are to be our reference for 
measuring variations. They have a socially-oriented life, and their 
way of life is such that, whether they intend it or not, society 
derives a certain advantage from their work. Also, from a psycho- 
logical point of view they have enough energy and courage to meet 
life's problems and difficulties as they come along. Both of these 
qualities are missing in the case of psychopathic people: they are 
neither socially well adjusted, nor are they psychologically ad- 
justed to the daily tasks of life. 
The 'Maladiusted' Life Style 
As an illustration of lack of adjustment we may take the case of 
a certain individual, a man of thirty who always escaped at the 
last moment from the solution to his problems. He had a friend 
but was very suspicious of him, and as a result this friendship 
never prospered. Friendship cannot grow under such conditions, 
because the other person feels the tension in the relationship. This 
man really had no friends, despite the fact that he was on speaking 
the life s tyle

terms with a large number of people. He was not sufficiently 
interested in other people to make friends. In fact he did not like 
being with people, and was always silent in the company of 
others. He explained this by saying that in company he never had 
any ideas and therefore had nothing to say. 
He was very shy. He had a pink skin and occasionally became 
flushed when he talked. When he could overcome this shyness he 
would speak quite well. What he really needed was to be helped 
in this direction without criticism. He was not very popular and 
he felt this, which increased his dislike for speaking to people. His 
life style was such that if he approached other people he only drew 
attention to himself. 
Next to social life the most important question is the one of 
occupation. Our patient always had the fear that he might fail in 
his career, and so he studied day and night; he overworked 
himself. And because he suffered from the consequences of over- 
work, he put himself out of commission and became unable to 
meet the challenge of his occupation. 
If we compare our patient's approach to these first two 
challenges in his life, we see that he always put himself under 
pressure. This is a sign that he had a great feeling of inferiority; 
he undervalued himself and looked on others and on new 
situations as being hostile to him. He acted as though he was in 
enemy territory.

abyss, straining and always tense; he manages to go forward but 
only conditionally, and he would prefer to stay at home and not 
deal with other people. 
The third question with which this man was confronted - and 
it is a challenge for which most people are not very well prepared 
- is the challenge of love. He hesitated to approach women. He 
felt that he wanted to love and to get married, but because of his 
great feeling of inferiority he was too frightened to face the 
prospect. He could not accomplish what he wanted; we see his 
whole behaviour and attitude summed up in the words, 'Yes . . . 
but!' He fell in love with one girl after another. This is, of course, 
a frequent occurrence with neurotic people because in a sense two 
women are less than one; this truth sheds some light on what lies 
behind a tendency towards polygamy or two-timing. 
Let us discuss the reasons for this life style. Individual 
Psychology undertakes to analyse its causes. This man, like each 
one of us, established his life style during his first four or five 
years. At that time some tragedy must have happened that greatly 
influenced him, and so we must find out about this tragedy. 
Something made him lose his normal interest in others and gave 
him the impression that life is simply one big problem, and that 
it is better not to go on at all rather than to be always confronting 
difficult situations. He became cautious, hesitant, and a seeker 
of ways to escape.

u n d e r s t a n d i n g  l i f e  
arises from the fact that they are for some time the centre of 
attention, only to be displaced from their position of glory 
when another child comes along and appears to be preferred. 
In a great many cases, where people are shy and afraid to go 
forward we find the reason to be that they believe another 
person has been preferred. In this case it is not difficult to 
work out that this is where the trouble lies. 
Methods of Diagnosis 
Often we need only ask a patient in our consulting room, 'Are 
you the first, second, or third child in the family?' Then we 
have all the clues we need. We can also use an entirely different 
method: we can ask for early memories, which we shall discuss 
at some length in the next chapter. This method is worthwhile 
because these memories or first pictures are a part of the 
development of the early life style, which we have called the 
prototype. One comes upon an actual part of the prototype 
when people talk about their early memories. Looking back, 
everybody remembers certain important things, and indeed 
what remains preserved in somebody's memory is always 
important. 
There are schools of psychology that act on the opposite 
assumption; they believe that what a person has forgotten is the 
most important. But there is really no great difference between 
these two ideas. Perhaps people can recount their conscious 
memories, but do not know what they mean - they do not see

arises from the fact that they are for some time the centre of 
attention, only to be displaced from their position of glory 
when another child comes along and appears to be preferred. 
In a great many cases, where people are shy and afraid to go 
forward we find the reason to be that they believe another 
person has been preferred. In this case it is not difficult to 
work out that this is where the trouble lies. 
Methods of Diagnosis 
Often we need only ask a patient in our consulting room, 'Are 
you the first, second, or third child in the family?' Then we 
have all the clues we need. We can also use an entirely different 
method: we can ask for early memories, which we shall discuss 
at some length in the next chapter. This method is worthwhile 
because these memories or first pictures are a part of the 
development of the early life style, which we have called the 
prototype. One comes upon an actual part of the prototype 
when people talk about their early memories. Looking back, 
everybody remembers certain important things, and indeed 
what remains preserved in somebody's memory is always 
important. 
There are schools of psychology that act on the opposite 
assumption; they believe that what a person has forgotten is the 
most important. But there is really no great difference between 
these two ideas. Perhaps people can recount their conscious 
memories, but do not know what they mean - they do not see 
52 

the l i f e  style 
the connection with present actions. So the result is the same, 
whether we emphasize the hidden or forgotten significance of 
conscious memories, or the importance of unconscious ones. 
Descriptions of early memories are highly illuminating. A man 
might tell you that when he was small, his mother went shopping 
with him and his younger brother. He pictures himself and a 
younger brother. Therefore we immediately see it must have been 
important to him to have had a younger brother. Lead him further 
and you may find a situation similar to a certain case in which a 
man recalled that it began to rain while the family was out 
shopping. His mother took him in her arms, but when she looked 
at the younger brother she put him down so that she could carry 
the little one instead. Thus we can picture his life style - he always 
has the expectation that another person will be preferred. We can 
understand, therefore, why he cannot speak in the company of 
others, for he is always looking around to see if another will not 
push him out of the limelight. The same is true with friendship: 
he is always thinking that another will be preferred by his friend, 
and as a result he can never establish true friendship. He is 
constantly suspicious, looking out for little things that he can 
interpret as betrayal or rejection. 
We can also see how the tragedy he has experienced has 
hindered the development of his social interest. He recalls that his 
mother took the younger brother in her arms and we see that he 
feels that this baby had more of his mother's attention than he 
did. He is convinced that the younger brother is preferred and is 
constantly looking for confirmation of this idea. He is determined

to be proved right, and so is always under strain - always under 
the great difficulty of trying to accomplish things when someone 
else is preferred. 
The only solution apparent to such suspicious people is com- 
plete isolation, so that they will not have to compete at all with 
others and will be, so to speak, the only human beings on earth. 
Sometimes, indeed, such children will fantasize that the whole 
world has suffered some disaster, that they are the only people 
left alive and that hence no one else can have an advantage over 
them. We see how they tap all possibilities to comfort themselves, 
but they do not go along the lines of logic, common sense, or truth 
- rather along the lines of suspicion or private logic. They live in 
a private world, and have a private idea of escape. They have 
absolutely no connection with others and no interest in others, 
but they are not to be blamed, for we know that their mental 
processes are not 'normal'. 
Developing Social Feeling 
It is our task to help such people develop the social feeling 
demanded of a socially well-adjusted human being. How is this 
to be done? The great difficulty with individuals behaving this 
way is that they are overstrained and always looking for 
confirmation of their fixed ideas. It thus becomes impossible 
to change their ideas unless somehow we can penetrate their 
personality in a way that will question their preconceptions. 
To accomplish this it is necessary to use both skill and tact.

And it is best if the counsellor has no close relationship to or 
interest in the patient, for if one is directly concerned in the 
case, one will find that one is acting in one's own interest and 
not in the interest of the patient. The patient will not fail to 
notice this and will become suspicious. 
The important thing is to decrease patients' feelings of 
inferiority. These cannot be eliminated entirely, and in fact we 
do not want to do so because feelings of inferiority can serve as 
useful foundations on which to build. What we have to do is to 
change patients' goals. We have seen that their goal has been one 
of escape because someone else is preferred, and it is around 
this complex of ideas that we must work. We must decrease 
their feelings of inferiority by showing them that they really 
undervalue themselves. We can show them the mistakes in their 
actions and explain to them their tendency to be over-tense, as 
if they were standing before a great chasm or as if they were 
living in enemy territory, in constant danger. We can indicate to 
them how their fear that others may do better than them is 
standing in the way of their doing their best work and making 
the best impression. 
If such people could act out the role of a host at a party, 
making sure their friends have a good time, being friendly with 
them and thinking of their interests, they would improve tremen- 
dously. But in ordinary social life we see that they do not enjoy 
themselves, do not have constructive ideas, and as a result say:

misconceptions is that they do not understand their situation 
because of their reliance on private logic and their lack of 
common sense. 
Overcoming Depression and Fear 
Let us now look at another specific case - the case of a man 
afflicted with depression. This is a very common illness, but it can 
be cured. People susceptible to depression can be identified very 
early in life. Many children, in their approach to new circum- 
stances, show signs of suffering from depression. 
The man in this case had about ten bouts of depression, and 
these always occurred when he started a new job. As long as 
he was in a familiar job he could be described as nearly 
'normal', but he did not want to go out and he wanted to rule 
over others. Consequently he had no friends, and at fifty he 
had never married. 
Let us look at his childhood in order to study his life style. 
He had been very sensitive and quarrelsome, always dominating 
his older brothers and sisters by emphasizing his pains and his 
weaknesses. When playing on a couch one day, he told us, when 
he was only four or five years old, he pushed all the other children 
off. When his aunt reproached him for this, he said, 'Now my 
whole life is ruined because you have blamed me!' 
Such was his life style - always trying to rule over others, 
always complaining of his weakness and of how much he 
suffered. This characteristic led in his later life to depression,

the l i f e  style 
which in itself is simply an expression of weakness. Many 
depressed patients use almost the same words: 'My whole life is 
ruined. I have lost everything.' Frequently, such people have once 
been pampered and are so no longer, and this influences their 
life style. 
For the most part, human beings have a tendency to be afraid. 
This timidity, when expressed in a social situation, is one of the 
most frequent causes of poor social adjustment. There was a man 
from an aristocratic family who never wanted to exert himself, 
but always wished to be supported and looked after. He appeared 
weak, and of course he could not find a job. His brothers turned 
against him, saying, 'You are so stupid that you cannot even find 
a job. You don't understand anything.' So he turned to drink. 
After some months, he was a confirmed alcoholic and was put in 
a treatment centre for two years. 
The treatment helped him but did not benefit him perma- 
nently, for he was sent back into the community without any 
preparation. He could find no work except as a labourer, even 
though he was a scion of a well-known family. Soon he began to 
have hallucinations. He thought a man appeared before him to 
tease and torment him so that he could not work. First he could 
not work because he was an alcoholic, and then because he had 
hallucinations. And so we can see that it is not appropriate 
treatment merely to make alcoholics stop drinking; we must find 
and correct the errors in their life style. This man had been a 
pampered child, always wanting to be helped. He was not pre- 
pared to work alone.

Discovering the Prototype 
Having analysed the significance of an individual's life style, we 
turn now to the topic of childhood memories, which are perhaps the 
most important means for understanding a life style. By looking back 
through childhood memories we are able to uncover the prototype - 
the core of the life style - better than by any other method. 
After we have heard a little about a patient's complaints, we 
ask him for his childhood memories and then compare them with 
the other facts he has given. For the most part, the life style never 
changes; there is always the same person with the same personality, 
a unity. A life style, as we have shown, is built up through the 
striving for a particular goal of superiority, and so we must expect 
every word, act and feeling to be a part of this effort. At some 
points it is especially clearly expressed, and this happens 
particularly in childhood memories.

We should not, however, distinguish too sharply between early 
and recent memories, for in recent recollections too the pattern is 
involved. It is easier and more illuminating, however, to find the 
direction of striving at its beginning, for then we discover the basic 
theme and are able to understand that the life style of a person 
does not really change. 
When patients look back into their past we can be sure that 
anything their memory turns up will be of emotional interest to 
them, and thus we will find a clue to their personality. It is not to 
be denied that forgotten experiences are also important for the 
life style and for the prototype, but often it is more difficult to 
have access to forgotten or, as they are called, unconscious 
memories. Both conscious and unconscious recollections have the 
quality of tending towards the same goal of superiority. They are 
both part of the complete prototype. It is advisable, therefore, to 
investigate both the conscious and unconscious memories if pos- 
sible, because both are in the end equally important, and the 
individual himself generally understands neither. It is for the 
outsider to understand and interpret both. 
Let us begin with conscious memories. Some people, when they 
are asked for early memories, answer, 'I don't have any.' We must 
ask such people to concentrate and try to remember. After some 
effort, we usually find that they will recall something. But this 
hesitation may be considered as a sign that they do not want to 
look far back into their childhood, and we may then come to the 
conclusion that their childhood has not been pleasant. We have

what we need to know. They invariably remember something in 
the end. 
Some people, on the other hand, claim that they can remember 
back to when they were only one year old. This is scarcely 
possible, and the truth is probably that these are fancies and not 
true memories. But it does not matter whether they are imagined 
or true since either way they are parts of someone's personality. 
Others insist that they are unsure whether they remember a 
thing or whether their parents later told them about it. This, too, 
is not really important because even if their parents did tell them, 
they have fixed the fact in their minds and therefore it helps to 
tell us where their interest lies. 
Types of Memories 
As we explained in the previous chapter, it is convenient for 
certain purposes to classify individuals into types. Childhood 
memories fall into types and reveal what is to be expected of the 
behaviour of a particular type of person. For instance, let us take 
the case of a person who remembers that he saw a marvellous 
Christmas tree, filled with lights, presents and baubles. What is 
the most interesting thing in this story? The fact that he saw these 
things. Why does he tell us what he has seen? Because he is always 
interested in visual things. He has perhaps struggled against some 
difficulties with eyesight, and, having been trained, has always 
been more interested in and attentive to what he can see. Perhaps 
this is not the most important element of his life style, but it is an 
chi ldho o d  m e m o ries

interesting and valuable part. It indicates that if we are to advise 
him on a suitable occupation it should be one in which he will use 
his eyes. 
In school, the education of children often disregards this 
principle of types. We may find children interested in visual things 
who will not listen to the teacher because they always want to be 
looking at something. In the case of such children we ought to be 
patient in trying to educate them to listen. Many children at 
school learn only in one way because they enjoy things with only 
one of their senses. They may be good only at listening or at 
seeing. Some always like to be on the move and working. We 
cannot expect the same results from different types of children, 
especially if the teacher prefers one teaching method, such as 
talking to the children. When such a method is predominant, the 
'lookers' and the 'doers' will suffer and be hindered in their 
development. 
Consider the case of a young man, twenty-four years old, who 
suffered from fainting spells. When asked for his childhood 
memories, he recalled that when he was four years old he fainted 
when he heard an engine whistle. In other words, he was a man 
who had heard, and was therefore interested in hearing. It is not 
necessary to explain here how this young man later developed 
fainting spells, but it is sufficient to note that from his childhood 
he was very sensitive to sound. He was very musical, and could 
not bear unpleasant noises, disharmony or strident tones. We are 
not surprised, therefore, that he should have been so affected by 
the sound of a whistle. Children or adults are often particularly

interested in certain things because they have suffered through 
them. This was seen in the case of the man with asthma mentioned 
in chapter 2. He had been bound tightly around his chest for some 
childhood complaint, and as a result had developed an 
extraordinary interest in ways of breathing. 
One meets people whose whole interest seems to lie in things 
to eat. Their childhood memories have to do with eating, and it 
seems the most important thing in the world for them - how to 
eat, what to eat, and what not to eat. We will often find that 
difficulties connected with food or digestion in early life have 
enhanced the importance of eating for such an individual. 
A person may also have memories connected with movement 
and walking. Many children who could not move very well at the 
beginning of life because they were weak or suffered from 
enfeebling illnesses become abnormally interested in movement 
and always want to hurry. The following case serves as an 
illustration. 
A man of fifty came to the doctor complaining that whenever 
he accompanied somebody across the road he suffered from a 
terrible fear that they would both be run over. When alone, he 
was never bothered with such a fear and was quite composed 
when crossing the road. It was only when someone else was with 
him that he felt compelled to save that person. He would grasp 
his companion's arm, push him to the right or to the left, and 
generally annoy him. Let us analyse the reasons for this behaviour. 
Asked for his childhood memories, he explained that when he 
was three years old he was physically weak and suffered from 
childho o d  m e m o r t e s

A person may also have memories connected with movement 
and walking. Many children who could not move very well at the 
beginning of life because they were weak or suffered from 
enfeebling illnesses become abnormally interested in movement 
and always want to hurry. The following case serves as an 
illustration. 
A man of fifty came to the doctor complaining that whenever 
he accompanied somebody across the road he suffered from a 
terrible fear that they would both be run over. When alone, he 
was never bothered with such a fear and was quite composed 
when crossing the road. It was only when someone else was with 
him that he felt compelled to save that person. He would grasp 
his companion's arm, push him to the right or to the left, and 
generally annoy him. Let us analyse the reasons for this behaviour. 
Asked for his childhood memories, he explained that when he 
was three years old he was physically weak and suffered from 
63 

u n d e r s t a n d i n g  l i f e  
rickets. He was twice hit by vehicles when crossing a street. And 
so, now that he was a man, it was important for him to prove that 
he had overcome this weakness. He wanted to show, so to speak, 
that he was the only man who knew how to cross a street. He was 
always looking for an opportunity to prove it whenever he was 
with someone else. Of course, being able to cross a street safely 
is not something in which most people would take pride or want 
to compete with others. But with people like our patient, the 
desire to move nimbly and to show off the ability to do so can be 
quite strong. 
Another case is that of a boy who was on the way to 
becoming a criminal. He stole, played truant from school, and 
so on, until his parents were in despair. His childhood memories 
revealed the fact that he had always wanted to move around 
and to hurry. He was now working at his father's business and 
was sitting still all day. From the nature of the case, part of the 
treatment prescribed was that he be made a salesman - a 
traveller for his father's business. 
Death in the Family 
One of the most significant types of childhood memories is the 
death of someone close during early childhood. When children 
see someone die, the effect on their minds is very marked. 
Sometimes such children become morbid; sometimes, without 
becoming morbid, they devote their whole lives to the problem 
of death and are always occupied in struggling against illness and

death in some way. We may find many of these children interested 
in medicine later in life, and they may become physicians or 
pharmacists. Such a goal, of course, is on the useful side of life. 
They are not only engaged in a private struggle against death, but 
help others. 
Sometimes, however, the prototype develops in a very egotist- 
ical way. A child who was very much affected by the death of an 
elder sister was asked what he wanted to be. The answer expected 
was that he would be a physician. Instead he replied: 'A grave- 
digger.' When asked why he wanted to follow this occupation, he 
answered, 'Because I want to be the one to bury the others and 
not the one who is buried.' This goal, we see, is not constructive, 
for the boy is interested only in himself. 
The Memories of Pampered Children 
Let us turn now to consider the memories of those who were 
pampered as children. The early recollections mirror the charac- 
teristics of these people very clearly. Children of this type often 
mention their mothers, which is perhaps natural but can also be 
a sign that they have had to struggle for a favourable situation. 
Sometimes the memories seem quite innocuous, but they repay 
careful analysis. For instance, a man may tell you, 'I was sitting 
in my room and my mother stood by the cabinet.' This appears 
unimportant, but the mention of his mother is a sign that this has 
been a matter of interest to him. Sometimes the mother is more 
hidden and the study becomes more complicated; we have to guess

u n d e r s t a n d i n g  l i f e  
about the mother. Thus the man in question may tell you, 'I 
remember making a journey.' If you ask who accompanied him, 
you will discover it was his mother. Or, if children tell us, 'I 
remember I was in the countryside one summer,' we can guess 
that the mother was with the children, and see the hidden influ- 
ence of the mother. 
In studying many memories we can see a struggle for prefer- 
ment. We can see how a child in the course of his development 
begins to value the attention his mother gives him, and his 
memories concern the presence or absence of such attention. This 
is important for our understanding because if children or adults 
tell us about such memories, we may be sure that they always feel 
that they are in danger of losing something or that another will 
be preferred to them. We see a tension indicating that in later life 
such persons will be of a jealous disposition. 
Specific Memories 
Sometimes people express interest in one point above all others. 
For instance, one patient's earliest memory was: 'I had to watch 
my little sister one day and I wanted to protect her as well as I 
could. I put her near the table but the cover caught and she fell 
down.' The child was only four years old at the time, which is of 
course an early age at which to permit a child to watch over a 
younger one. We can see what a tragedy this was in the life of the 
child, who was doing everything possible to protect the younger 
sister. This patient grew up and married a kind - we might almost

say, obedient - husband. But she was always jealous and critical, 
always afraid that her husband would prefer another. We can 
easily understand how the husband tired of her and concentrated 
on the children. 
Sometimes tension is more directly expressed and people 
remember that they actually wanted to hurt other members of their 
family, even to kill them. Such people are interested in their own 
affairs exclusively and do not like other people - they feel a certain 
rivalry towards them. This feeling is already present in the 
prototype. 
There are some people who can never finish anything because 
they fear someone else will be preferred as a friend or colleague, 
or because they suspect other people are always trying to surpass 
them. They can never really become a part of the community 
because of the fear that others might outshine them and be 
preferred. In every situation they are extremely tense, and this 
attitude is especially evident in connection with love and marriage. 
We come now to the hated or unwanted child. This type, 
fortunately, is rare. If a child is really hated and neglected from 
the beginning of his life, he cannot live - such a child will perish. 
Usually children have parents who pamper them to some extent 
and satisfy their desires, but we do find children who feel un- 
wanted or hated, and we often see these children becoming 
depressed. Frequently we find in their memories an emphasis on 
being scolded, hated, or criticized.

running away because his mother constantly scolded and pun- 
ished him, he then fell into a pond and almost drowned. We see 
from this memory that he left home once and met with great 
danger. Thereafter he constantly looked for danger when he went 
out. He had been a bright child but always feared that he might 
not gain first place in examinations, so he hesitated and could not 
go on. When he at last got to university he feared that he would 
not be able to compete with the other students. We see how all 
this may be traced back to his old memories of danger. 
Another case that illustrates this is of an orphan whose parents 
died when he was only about a year old. He was not cared for 
properly in the orphanage. Nobody looked after him, and in later 
life it was very difficult for him to make friends or work with 
colleagues. Looking back to his early memories we see that he 
always felt others were preferred. This feeling played an impor- 
tant part in his development, he always felt hated, and this 
hindered his approach to all life's problems. He was excluded 
from all the normal situations of life, such as love, marriage, 
friendship, work - all the situations that required contact with his 
fellow human beings - because of his feeling of inferiority. 
A further interesting case is that of a middle-aged man who 
was always complaining of sleeplessness. He was about forty-six, 
married, and had children. He was very critical of everybody, and 
was always trying to act the tyrant, particularly over members of 
his family. His behaviour made everyone feel miserable.

always fighting and threatening each other, so that he was afraid 
of them both. He went to school dirty and uncared for. One day 
his usual teacher was absent and a substitute took her place. This 
woman was interested in her job and saw that it was good and 
noble work. She saw potential in this unkempt boy and went out 
of her way to encourage him. This was the first time in his life 
he had had any such treatment. From that time on he began to 
develop well, but it was always as if he were pushed from behind. 
He did not really believe he was able to do well, and so he worked 
all day and half the night too. In this way he grew up believing 
that he must use half the night for his work, or else not sleep at 
all but spend the time thinking about what he had to do. He 
believed it was necessary to be awake almost all night in order 
to accomplish anything worthwhile. 
Later, his desire to be superior was expressed in his attitude 
towards his family and in his behaviour towards others. His 
family being weaker than he was, he could play the role of a 
conqueror with them. Inevitably his wife and children suffered 
much through this behaviour. 
Summing up the character of this man as a whole, we may 
say that he had a goal of superiority and that it was the goal 
of a person with a great feeling of inferiority. His tenseness 
was a sign of his doubt of his own success, and this doubt in 
turn was covered up by a pose of superiority. A study of 
childhood memories can thus be shown to reveal the situation 
in its true light.

Predictive Analysis 
If we can analyse childhood memories we can predict, as we have 
said, what will happen later in the life of our patients. Memories 
are signs of what happened in a person's life and how develop- 
ment took place; they indicate the movement towards a goal and 
what obstacles have had to be overcome. They also show how 
people become more interested in one side of life than another. 
We see that they may have suffered what we call a trauma, in a 
sexual matter, for instance; therefore, they may be more interested 
in such matters than in others. We cannot be surprised if, when 
we ask for early memories, we hear of some sexual experiences. 
Some people are more interested in sex than others at an early 
age. Naturally, it is part of normal human behaviour to be 
interested in sex but, as I have said before, there are many varieties 
and degrees of interest. We often find that in a case where people 
tell us about sexual experiences, they later put emphasis on this 
aspect of life. The resulting life style is not harmonious because 
this one side of human nature is overvalued. There are people who 
insist that every experience has a sexual basis. On the other hand, 
there are those who insist that the stomach is the most important 
part of the body, and we will find that early memories also parallel 
later preoccupations in such instances. 
There was a boy who would never settle down at high school. 
He wanted to be constantly moving, and would never concentrate 
on studying. He was always thinking about something else, 
frequenting cafis and visiting friends - all when he should have

In the last chapter we tried to describe the way in which childhood 
memories and fancies may be used to illuminate the hidden life 
style of an individual. The study of childhood memories is only 
one method of studying personality. All methods depend on the 
principle of using isolated parts for an interpretation of the whole. 
Besides childhood memories, we can also observe characteristic 
physical movements and mental attitudes. Bodily postures and 
movements are an expression of psychological attitudes, and these 
attitudes are an expression of that whole approach to life that 
constitutes what we call the life style.

72 

expressions of the life style 
and sitting, their facial expressions and so on. We do not always 
consciously judge, but a basic feeling of sympathy or antipathy is 
usually created by these impressions. 
Let us consider ways of standing, for instance. We notice 
straight away whether a child or adult stands upright or is hunched 
and bent over. But we have to watch for exaggerations, such as 
people who stand too straight, in a stretched position; this makes 
us suspect that they are using too much effort to retain this posture. 
We can suppose that these people feel much smaller than they want 
to appear. In this minor point we can see how they mirror what 
we have called the superiority complex. They want to appear 
courageous. 
On the other hand we see people with just the opposite 
posture - those who appear bent and are always stooping. Such a 
posture suggests that they are cowards. But it is a rule of our art 
and science that we should always be cautious, looking for other 
points and never judging solely by one criterion. Sometimes we 
might feel that we are almost sure of being correct, but we still want 
to verify our judgement by weighing up other points. We might 
ask, 'Are we right in insisting that people who stoop are often 
cowards? What can we expect of them in a difficult situation?' 
Such people often try to rest upon something, to lean on a table 
or chair, for instance. They do not trust their own strength and 
want to be supported. This reflects the same attitude of mind as 
that characteristic of people who stand bent over, and so when 
we find both types of posture present our judgement is reinforced 
to a certain extent.

Children who always want to be supported and protected do 
not have the same posture as independent-minded children. We 
can tell the degree of independence by how children stand, and 
how they approach other people. In such cases we need not have 
any doubt, for there are many ways of confirming our conclu- 
sions. And once we have confirmed them, we can take steps to 
remedy the situation and put the child on the right path. 
Thus we may experiment with children who constantly seek 
support. Sit their mother on a chair and then let the children come 
into the room. We will find that they do not look at any other 
person but go directly towards their mother and lean on the chair 
or against their mother. This confirms what we expect - that they 
feel dependent. 
It is also interesting to note children's ways of approaching 
others, for this shows the degree of social interest and social 
adjustment. It expresses the confidence, or lack of confidence, that 
children have in others. We will find that people who do not want 
to approach others and who always stand far away are also 
reserved in other respects; they may rarely speak and are 
unusually quiet. 
As an illustration, let us take the case of a woman who came 
to a doctor for treatment. The doctor expected her to take a seat 
near him, but when she was offered a chair she looked around and 
took a seat some distance away. It could only be concluded that 
this was a person who wanted to be connected only with certain 
people. She said straight away that she was married, and from this 
the whole story could be guessed - she wanted to be connected

Thus we may experiment with children who constantly seek 
support. Sit their mother on a chair and then let the children come 
into the room. We will find that they do not look at any other 
person but go directly towards their mother and lean on the chair 
or against their mother. This confirms what we expect - that they 
feel dependent. 
It is also interesting to note children's ways of approaching 
others, for this shows the degree of social interest and social 
adjustment. It expresses the confidence, or lack of confidence, that 
children have in others. We will find that people who do not want 
to approach others and who always stand far away are also 
reserved in other respects; they may rarely speak and are 
unusually quiet. 
As an illustration, let us take the case of a woman who came 
to a doctor for treatment. The doctor expected her to take a seat 
near him, but when she was offered a chair she looked around and 
took a seat some distance away. It could only be concluded that 
this was a person who wanted to be connected only with certain 
people. She said straight away that she was married, and from this 
the whole story could be guessed - she wanted to be connected 
74 

expressions of the life style 
only with her husband. It could also be guessed that she wanted 
to be pampered, that if she was alone she would suffer great 
anxiety, that she would never want to go out of her house alone 
and would not enjoy meeting other people. In short, from her one 
physical movement we could arrive at a good guess about the 
whole story. But there are other ways of confirming our theory. 
She may tell us: 'I am suffering from anxiety.' We know that 
anxiety can be used as a weapon with which to rule another 
person. If an adult or child suffers from anxiety we can guess that 
there is another person who supports them. 
There was once a couple who insisted that they were free 
thinkers. Such people believe that everybody can do what he 
or she wants in marriage, so long as each one tells the other 
what happens. Consequently the husband had some love affairs 
and told his wife all about them. She seemed perfectly content. 
But later on she began to suffer from anxiety. She would not 
go out alone. Her husband always had to go with her. We can 
see, then, how she used her anxiety or phobia to modify this 
aspect of their relationship. 
Timidity 
Let us analyse the prototype of a timid and hesitating person. 
There was a boy who came to school seeming very shy. This is an 
important sign that he does not want to be connected with others. 
He had no friends, and was always anxiously waiting for the time 
when he could go home. He moved very slowly, and would go

down the school steps keeping to the wall, then look down the 
street and rush towards his house. He was not a good pupil at 
school, and did very poorly in his work since he did not feel happy 
inside the school walls. He always wanted to go home to his 
mother, a widow who was weak and pampered him very much. 
In order to understand more about the case the doctor went to 
talk with the mother. 
He asked her, 'Does the boy want to go to bed at bedtime?' 
She replied that he did. 
'Does he cry out at night?' 
'No.' 
'Does he wet the bed?' 
'No.' 
The doctor thought that there must be some mistake. Then he 
realized what the reason was: the boy must sleep in the same bed 
as his mother. How did the doctor reach this conclusion? Well, to 
cry out at night is to demand the mother's attention. If the boy was 
sleeping in her bed, this would not be necessary. Similarly, to wet 
the bed is also to demand the mother's attention. The doctor's 
conclusion was verified: the boy slept in his mother's bed. 
If we look carefully we will see that all the little things to which 
the psychologist pays attention form part of a consistent plan of 
life. Hence when we can see the goal - in this child's case, to be 
always close to his mother - we can conclude a great many things. 
We can conclude by this means whether a child is lacking in 
intelligence. An unintelligent child would not be able to establish 
such a clever plan of life.

Let us turn to the mental attitudes we can distinguish in different 
people. Some people are quarrelsome and aggressive, others 
always seem to want to give up the struggle. However, we never 
see a person who really gives up. This is not possible, for it is 
beyond human nature: the 'normal' person cannot give up. If they 
seem to do so, it indicates an even more desperate struggle to carry 
on than otherwise. 
There is a type of child who always seems to give up. Such 
children are usually the centre of attention in a family, and 
everybody has to care for them, push them forward and admonish 
them. They must be supported in life and are always a burden to 
others. This is their goal of superiority - they express their desire 
to dominate others in this fashion. Such a goal of superiority is, 
of course, the result of an inferiority complex, as we have already 
shown, for if they were not doubtful of their own powers, they 
would not take this easy way of attaining success. 
There was a boy of seventeen who illustrated this charac- 
teristic. He was the eldest in the family. We have already seen how 
the eldest child often experiences a tragedy when the coming of 
another child dethrones him from his place at the centre of family 
affections. This was the case with this boy. He was very depressed 
and peevish, and had no job. One day he tried to commit suicide. 
Soon after that he visited a doctor and explained that he had had

also see how children who are lazy at school, and indolent adults 
who seem incapable of doing anything, may be on the brink of 
danger. Often this indolence is only on the surface, and then 
something happens and they attempt suicide or other violence, or 
else a neurotic condition or mental disturbance may arise. To 
ascertain the mental attitude of such people is sometimes a 
difficult scientific task. 
Shyness in a child is another characteristic that is full of danger. 
Shy children must be carefully treated. Such children will always 
have great difficulties unless their shyness is overcome, for in our 
culture only courageous and outward-looking people achieve 
good results and benefit from the advantages of life. If people are 
courageous and suffer defeat they are not hurt so much, but shy 
people tend to make their escape to the useless side of life as soon 
as they see difficulties ahead. Such children may become neurotic 
or even insane in later life. 
We see such people going about with a shamefaced expression,

my life style gives to my perception of a problem that confronts 
me. Of course it is not always the logical answer that the philoso- 
pher would expect. It is the answer that my childhood experiences 
and mistaken perceptions have trained me to give. 
We can see the functioning of these attitudes as well as the way 
in which they have been developed more clearly in children or in 
'abnormal7 persons than 'normal7 adults. The prototype stage of 
the life style, as we have seen, is much clearer and simpler than 
the later stage. In fact, one may compare the functioning of the 
prototype to that of a tree which assimilates everything that comes 
along - manure, water, food, air. All these things will be used in 
its development. The difference between the prototype and the 
life style is like the difference between a tree with unripe and one 
with ripe fruit. The unripe fruit stage in human beings is much 
easier to open up and examine, but what it reveals is to a 
significant extent valid for the ripe fruit stage. 
We can see, for example, how children who are cowardly at 
the beginning of life express this cowardice in all their attitudes. 
A world of differences separates cowardly children from aggres- 
sive ones. Aggressive children always have a certain degree of 
courage, a natural outgrowth of what we have called common 
sense. Sometimes, however, very cowardly children may appear 
heroic in certain situations; this happens whenever they are 
deliberately trying to attain first place.

nearly drowned. This of course is not real courage, and could be 
described as on the 'useless' side of life. The boy merely did what 
he did because he wanted to be admired. He ignored the danger 
he was in, and hoped that others would save him.

The question of courage and timidity is psychologically closely 
related to the belief in predestination. The belief in predesti- 
nation affects our capacity for useful action. There are people 
who have such a feeling of superiority that they feel they can 
accomplish anything; they know everything and do not want 
to learn anything. We have all seen the end result of such 
ideas. Children who feel this way in school usually get poor 
marks. There are other people who always want to try the 
most dangerous sports - they feel that nothing can happen to 
them, that they cannot suffer defeat. Very often the outcome 
is a bad one. 
We commonly find this sense of privileged destiny among 
people to whom something terrible has happened and yet they 
have remained unhurt. For instance, they may have been involved 
in a serious accident and escaped uninjured. As a result they feel 
that they are destined for higher things.

memories he related a very significant experience. 
He was once about to go to a theatre in Vienna, but had to 
attend to something first. When he finally arrived at the theatre 
it had burned down. Everything was destroyed, but he was saved. 
One can well understand how such a person felt himself privileged 
and destined for higher things. All went well until he suffered 
defeat in his relationship with his wife, and then he broke down. 
Much could be said and written about the significance of such 
a belief in fatalism. It affects whole peoples and civilizations, let 
alone individuals, but I wish to point out only its connection with 
the sources of psychological activity and the life style. The belief 
in predestination is in many ways an escape from the task of 
striving and working in a useful activity. For that reason it will 
prove a false support. 
Envy and Jealousy 
One of the basic mental attitudes that most affects our relations 
with our fellow human beings is that of envy. To be envious is a 
sign of a feeling of inferiority. We all have a certain amount of 
envy in our make-up, and a small amount does no harm. We must, 
however, ensure that envy serves a useful purpose. It must result 
in work, in perseverance, and in facing up to our problems. If it 
does, we should excuse the bit of envy found in each of us. 
On the other hand, sexual jealousy is a much more difficult 
and dangerous mental attitude, because it cannot be made useful.

understanding l i f e  
There is no single way in which a jealous person can be useful. 
Moreover, we see in jealousy the fruit of a deep feeling of 
inferiority. A jealous person is afraid of his or her inability to keep 
his or her partner. And so at the very moment when one partner 
wishes to influence the other most, he or she betrays his or her 
weakness by expressions of jealousy. If we look at the prototype 
of such a person we shall see a sense of defeat; he or she is probably 
a person who has once been dethroned and expects to be de- 
throned again. 
The Masculine Protest 
From the general problem of envy and jealousy we may pass to 
the consideration of a very particular type of envy - the envy of 
the female sex for the social position of the male sex. We find 
many women and girls who want to be male. This attitude, which 
I have termed the 'masculine protest', is quite understandable, for 
if we look at things impartially we can see that in our culture men 
are all too often in the lead, more appreciated, valued and 
esteemed than women. Morally, this is inexcusable and ought to 
be corrected. 
Girls see that in the family the men and boys are privileged 
and less burdened with the smaller cares of life, which are left 
to the females. Men are freer in many ways, and this perceived 
freedom makes girls dissatisfied with their role. They therefore 
try to act like boys. Girls' imitation of boys may appear in 
various ways: we see them, for instance, trying to dress like

boys, and in this they are sometimes supported by their parents. 
But there are some destructive attitudes, as when a girl insists 
on being called by a boy's name and not by her own name. 
Such girls get very angry if others do not call them by the name 
they have chosen. This attitude is very dangerous if it reflects 
something profound and is not a mere prank. In such a case it 
may reappear later in life as a dissatisfaction with the feminine 
role and a distaste for marriage - or, when married, a distaste 
for the sexual role of a woman. 
It is appropriate for women to develop like men in many ways, 
and to have a profession like men. But it is dangerous for them to 
be dissatisfied with their feminine role and try to adopt the vices 
of men. 
This dangerous tendency first makes its appearance in adoles- 
cence, for it is then that the prototype becomes affected. Immature 
girls become jealous of the privileges enjoyed by the boys. They 
react with the desire to imitate boys. This is a superiority complex 
and a departure from proper development. 
Anyone who believes that the basis of relationships between 
the sexes should be the principle of equality should not encourage 
this masculine protest on the part of women. The equality of the 
sexes can be fitted into the natural scheme of things, while the 
masculine protest is a blind revolt against reality and is thus a 
superiority complex. Through this masculine protest all the sexual 
functions can be disturbed. Many serious symptoms can be 
produced, and if we trace them back we shall see that the

Not so frequently as in the case of girls who want to be boys, 
we also encounter boys who wish to be like girls. They want to 
imitate not the ordinary girls, but those who flirt in an exagger- 
ated manner. Such boys may use face powder, wear flowers, and 
try to act like frivolous girls. This is also a form of superiority 
complex. 
We find in fact that in many such cases such boys have grown 
up in an environment in which a woman was at the head of the 
family. Thus the boys grew up imitating the characteristics of the 
mother, not of the father. 
There was a boy who came for consultation because of certain 
sexual problems. He related how he was always close to his 
mother, and his father did not have a significant role in the home. 
His mother had been a dressmaker before she married and 
continued something of her occupation afterwards. The boy, 
being always near her, became interested in the things she made. 
He began to sew and draw pictures of dresses for women. The 
extent of his interest in his mother can be judged from the fact 
that at four years of age he had learned to tell the time because 
his mother always went out at four and came back at five o'clock. 
Impelled by his pleasure on seeing her return, he learned to tell 
the time. 
Later in life, when he went to school, he acted like a girl. He 
took no part in sports or games and the other boys made fun of 
him. One day they had to put on a play, and as we may imagine, 
this boy had the part of a girl. He acted it so well that many in 
the audience thought he really was a girl. In this way, the boy

being always near her, became interested in the things she made. 
He began to sew and draw pictures of dresses for women. The 
extent of his interest in his mother can be judged from the fact 
that at four years of age he had learned to tell the time because 
his mother always went out at four and came back at five o'clock. 
Impelled by his pleasure on seeing her return, he learned to tell 
the time. 
Later in life, when he went to school, he acted like a girl. He 
took no part in sports or games and the other boys made fun of 
him. One day they had to put on a play, and as we may imagine, 
this boy had the part of a girl. He acted it so well that many in 
the audience thought he really was a girl. In this way, the boy

For Individual Psychology, consciousness and unconsciousness 
form a single entity, as we have already explained in a number of 
contexts. In the last two chapters we have been interpreting 
elements of consciousness - memories, attitudes and physical 
movements -in terms of the individual whole. We shall now apply 
the same method of interpretation to our unconscious or semi- 
conscious life - the life of our dreams. The justification for this 
method is that our dream life is just as much a part of the whole 
as our waking life. Followers of other schools of psychology are 
constantly trying to find new approaches to dreams, but our 
understanding of dreams has been developed along the same line 
as our understanding of all the integral parts of the psyche.

individual goals. A dream is always a part of the life style and 
we always find the prototype involved in it. In fact it is only 
when you see how the prototype is connected with a particular 
dream that you can be sure you have really understood the 
dream. Also, if you know people well, you can pretty nearly 
guess the nature of their dreams. 
Take, for instance, our assumption that mankind as a whole 
is not really courageous. From this general fact we can presuppose 
that a large proportion of dreams will be dreams of fear, danger, 
or anxiety. And so if we know somebody and see that her goal is 
to escape from having to solve life's problems, we can guess that 
she often dreams about falling down. Such a dream is like a 
warning to her: 'Do not go on - you will be defeated.' She 
expresses her view of her future in this way - by falling. The 
majority of people have similar dreams of falling at some time in 
their lives. 
A specific case is a student on the eve of an examination - a 
student whom we know to be lacking in determination. We can 
guess what will happen with him. He worries the whole day 
preceding the examination, cannot concentrate, and finally says 
to himself, 'The time is too short.' He wants to postpone the 
examination. His dream will be one of falling down. And this 
expresses his life style. 
Take another student who makes good progress in her studies, 
is courageous and never uses subterfuges. We can also guess her 
dreams. Before an examination she will dream that she climbs a 
high mountain, is enchanted with the view from the mountain

life, and we can see how it reflects her goal of accomplishment. 
Then there are people who limit their own potential - people 
who can proceed only up to a certain point. Such people dream 
about limits, and about being unable to escape from people or 
difficulties. They often have dreams of being chased and hunted. 
Before we go on to discuss the purpose of dreams it may be 
well to remark that the psychologist is never discouraged if 
somebody says to him, 'I cannot tell you any dreams because I 
never remember them. But I will make up some dreams.' The 
psychologist knows that people's imagination cannot create any- 
thing other than that which their life style commands. Their 
made-up dreams are just as good as genuinely remembered 
dreams, for their imagination and fancy will also be an expression 
of their life style. 
Fancy need not literally reflect people's real actions in order to 
be an expression of their life style. We find, for example, one type 
of person who lives more in imagination than in reality. They are 
very cowardly during the day but quite courageous in dreams. But 
we will always find something to indicate that they do not want 
to finish any real work. Such manifestations will be quite evident 
even in their most courageous dreams.

It is always the purpose of a dream to pave the way towards

goal of superiority. All a person's characteristics, actions and 
dreams are tools to enable them to find this dominating goal 
- whether it is one of being the centre of attention, of domi- 
neering, or of escape. 
The purpose of a dream is neither logically nor truthfully 
expressed within it. A dream exists in order to create a certain 
feeling, mood or emotion, and it is impossible to unravel its 
obscurities fully. But in this it differs from waking life and the 
activities of waking life only in extent, not in character. We have 
seen that the answers the psyche gives to life's problems are 
relative to the individual's scheme of life: they do not fit into a 
pre-established frame of logic, although it is our aim, for the 
purposes of improved social communications, to make them do 
so more and more. Once we relate it firmly to waking life, dream 
life loses its mystery. It becomes a further expression of the same 
attitudes, and the same mixture of fact and emotion that we find 
in waking life. 
Historically, dreams have always appeared very mysterious, 
with many peoples giving them a prophetic interpretation. 
Dreams were often regarded as prophecies of events to come, and 
in this there was a half-truth. It is true that dreams are bridges 
connecting the problems confronting dreamers with the goal they 
wish to attain. In this way dreams will often come true, because 
dreamers will be training for their part during the dream, and will 
be thus preparing for it to come true.

intelligent they can foresee the future, whether they analyse their 
waking life or their dream life. What they do is diagnose. For 
example, if somebody dreams that an acquaintance has died and 
the person does actually die, this might be no more than what a 
doctor or close relative could foresee. What the dreamer does is 
to think in his sleep rather than in waking life. 
The prophetic view of dreams, precisely because it contains a 
certain half-truth, is a superstition. It is generally clung to by 
people who are superstitious by nature, or promoted by people 
who seek importance by giving the impression that they have 
special powers. 
To dispel the prophetic superstition and the mystery that 
surrounds dreams we have to explain why most people do not 
understand their own dreams. The explanation is to be found in 
the fact that few people know themselves even in waking life. Few 
people have the power of reflective self-analysis which permits 
them to see where they are headed, and the analysis of dreams is, 
as we have said, a more complicated and obscure affair than the 
analysis of waking behaviour. It is thus no wonder that the 
analysis of dreams should be beyond the scope of most people - 
and it is also no wonder that in their ignorance of what is involved 
they should turn to charlatans.

It will help us to understand the logic of the dream if we compare 
it, not directly with normal waking life, but with the type of 
90 

d r e a m s  
phenomena we have described in previous chapters as a manifes- 
tation of private logic. The reader will remember how we de- 
scribed the attitudes of criminals, problem children and neurotics 
- they create a certain feeling, temper or mood in order to 
convince themselves of a certain fact. Thus murderers may justify 
themselves by saying, 'Life has no use for this person; therefore 
we must kill him.' By emphasizing in their own mind the view 
that their victim is unwanted they create a certain feeling that 
prepares them for murder. 
Such people may also reason that so-and-so has a nice car and 
they do not. They put such value on this that they become envious. 
Their goal of superiority becomes that of having a nice car, and 
so we may find them experiencing dreams that create a certain 
emotion leading to the accomplishment of that goal. We see this 
illustrated, in fact, in well-known dreams. There are, for instance, 
the dreams of Joseph in the Bible. He dreamed that all the others 
bent down before him. Now we can see how this dream fitted in 
with the whole episode of the coat of many colours - and with 
Joseph's banishment by his brothers. 
Another well-known dream is that of the Greek poet Simonides, 
who was invited to go to Asia Minor to lecture. He hesitated and 
continually postponed the trip in spite of the fact that the ship was 
in the harbour waiting for him. His friends tried to make him go, 
but to no avail. Then he had a dream. He dreamed that a dead 
man whose body he had found and for whom he had arranged 
burial appeared to him and said, 'Because you cared enough to 
give me a decent burial, I now warn you not to go to Asia Minor.'

Simonides said, 'I will not go,' and the ship on which he was 
to have sailed was lost with all aboard. He believed the dream 
had saved him. But he had already been inclined not to go before 
he ever had the dream. He simply created a certain feeling or 
emotion to back up a conclusion that he had already reached, 
although he did not understand his own dream. 
It is clear that one can create a fantasy for the purposes of 
self-deception, which results in a desired feeling or emotion. 
Frequently this feeling is all that is remembered of the dream. In 
considering Simonides' dream we come to another point. What 
should be the procedure in interpreting dreams? Firstly, we must 
bear in mind that a dream is part of a person's creative power. 
Simonides, dreaming, used his fancy and built up a story. He 
selected the incident of the dead man. Why should this poet pick 
the incident of the dead man from out of all his other experiences? 
Obviously, because he was at that time very much concerned 
with ideas of death, because he was terrified at the thought of 
sailing on a ship. In those days a sea voyage presented real danger, 
and so he hesitated. It is a sign that he was probably not only 
afraid of seasickness but that he also feared the ship would sink. 
As a result of this preoccupation with the thought of death, his 
dream selected the episode of the dead man. 
If we consider dreams in this manner, the task of interpretation 
is not too difficult. We should remember that the selection of 
images, memories and fancies is an indication of the direction in 
which the mind is moving. It shows you the dreamer's tendency, 
and ultimately we can see the goal he is striving for.

dreams 
Let us consider, for example, the dream of a certain married 
man. He was not content with his family life. He had two 
children, but was always worried about them, thinking that his 
wife did not take sufficient care of them and was too interested 
in other things. He was always criticizing his wife and trying 
to reform her. One night he dreamt that he had a third child, 
and that this child got lost and could not be found. In the dream 
he reproached his wife because she had not taken care of the 
child. 
Here we see that he had in mind the thought that one of his 
two children might be lost, but he was not courageous enough to 
make one of them the victim in his dream. So he invented a third 
child and made him get lost. 
Another point to be observed is that the man loved his children 
and did not want to lose them. Also, he felt that his wife was 
overburdened with two children and could not care for three, and 
so this third child would perish. Hence we find another aspect to 
the dream, which, when interpreted, reads: 'Should I have a third 
child or not?' 
The real result of the dream was that he had created a bad 
feeling against his wife. No child had really been lost, but he got 
up in the morning criticizing and feeling antagonistic towards 
her. People frequently get up in the morning feeling argumenta- 
tive and critical as a result of an emotion created by that night's 
dream. It is like a state of intoxication and not unlike what one 
finds in depression, where patients intoxicate themselves with 
ideas of defeat, of death and of all being lost.

understanding l i f e  
We may also see that this man selected things in which he was 
sure to be superior, as, for instance, the feeling, 'I am careful with 
the children, but my wife is not, and therefore one got lost.' Thus 
his tendency to dominate is revealed in his dream. 
Methods of Interpretation 
Modern interpretation of dreams dates from the early part of the 
twentieth century. Dreams were first regarded by Freud as the 
fulfilment of infantile sexual desires. I cannot agree with this, 
inasmuch as if dreams are such a fulfilment then everything can 
be regarded as a fulfilment. Every idea behaves in this way - going 
from the depths of the subconscious up into consciousness. The 
formula of sex-fulfilment thus explains nothing in particular. 
Later Freud suggested that the desire for death was involved. 
But surely our last example could not be explained very well in 
these terms, for we cannot say that the father wanted a child to 
get lost and die, or to die himself. 
The truth is that there is no specific formula that will explain 
all dreams, except the general principles we have discussed about 
the unity of mental life and about the special emotional character 
of dream life. This character, and its accompanying self-decep- 
tion, is a theme with many variations. It is also expressed in a 
preoccupation with comparisons and metaphors. The use of 
comparisons is one of the best means of deceiving oneself and 
others, for we may be sure that if people use them they do not 
feel sure that they can convince others with facts and logic. They

always want to influence others by means of useless and far-

Poets use these devices to deceive, but pleasantly, and we 
enjoy being entertained by their metaphors and poetic compari- 
sons. We may be sure, however, that they are meant to influence 
us more than we would be influenced by plainer words. If 
Homer, for example, speaks of an army of Greek soldiers 
overrunning a field like lions, the metaphor will not deceive us 
when we think sharply but it will certainly intoxicate us when 
we are taken by the poetic mood. The author makes us believe 
in a marvellous power, but he could not do this if he were 
merely to describe the clothes the soldiers wore, the arms they 
carried, and so on. 
We see the same thing in the case of people who are in difficulty 
explaining something: if they see they cannot convince you, they 
will use comparisons. This use of metaphors and comparisons, as 
we have said, is self-deceptive, and this is the reason it is so 
prominent in dreams, in the selection of symbolic images. It is an 
artistic way of intoxicating oneself. 
Dreamers and Non-Dreamers 
The fact that dreams are emotionally intoxicating offers, curi- 
ously enough, a method for preventing dreams. If people under- 
stand what they have been dreaming about and realize that they 
have merely been intoxicating themselves, they will stop dream-

is the case with me; I stopped dreaming as soon as I realized what 
dreaming meant. 
This realization, to be effective, must be a thorough emotional 
conversion. This was brought about, in my case, by my last 
dream. The dream occurred during the First World War. In 
connection with my duties I was making a great effort to keep a 
certain man from being sent to the front. In the dream the idea 
came to me that I had murdered someone, but I did not know 
whom. I got myself into a bad state wondering, 'Who have I 
murdered?' The fact is, I was simply intoxicated with the idea of 
making the greatest possible effort to keep the soldier in a safe 
place. The dream emotion was meant to be conducive to this idea, 
but when I understood the subterfuge of the dream, I gave up 
dreaming altogether, since I did not want to deceive myself in 
order to do the things that, for reasons of logic, I should either 
do or leave undone. 
This may be taken as an answer to the question that is 
frequently asked, 'Why do some people never dream?' These 
are people who do not want to deceive themselves. They are 
concerned with action and logic, and want to face up to 
problems. People of this sort, if they dream, often forget their 
dreams very quickly, so quickly, in fact, that they believe they 
have not been dreaming. 
There is a theory that we always dream but forget most of 
our dreams. If we accepted such a theory it would shed a different 
light on the fact that some of us never dream: we would become 
people who always forget their dreams. I do not accept this

theory. I rather believe that there are people who never dream, 
and there are also dreamers who sometimes forget their dreams. 
In the nature of the case such a theory is hard to refute, but 
perhaps the burden of proof should be put on the propounders 
of the theory. 
Why do we sometimes have the same dream repeatedly? This 
is a curious fact for which no definite explanation can be given. 
However, in such repeated dreams we are often able to find the 
life style expressed with greater clarity. Such a repeated dream 
gives us a definite and unmistakable indication as to where the 
individual goal of superiority lies. In the case of long, extended 
dreams we must believe that the dreamers are not ready and are 
looking for the way out of their problem to the achievement of 
their goal. For this reason, the dreams that can best be understood 
are short dreams. Sometimes dreams consist of only one image, 
or a few words, and this shows that dreamers are really trying to 
find an easy way to deceive themselves. 
Sleep and Hypnotism 
We may close our discussion with the question of sleep. A great 
many people ask themselves needless questions about sleep. They 
imagine that sleep is the direct opposite of being awake, and that 
it is akin to death. But such views are erroneous. Sleep is not the 
opposite of being awake, but rather a degree of wakefulness. We 
are not cut off from life during sleep. On the contrary, we think 
and hear in our sleep, and the same tendencies are generally

expressed in sleep as in waking life. Thus, there are mothers who 
cannot be awakened by any noises in the street, but if the children 
make the slightest sound they immediately jump up. We see from 
this how their interest is always awake. Also, from the fact that 
we do not fall out of bed we can see that we are conscious of limits 
during sleep. 
An individual's entire personality is expressed in both sleeping 
and waking. This explains the phenomenon of hypnotism. What 
charlatans have represented as a magical power is for the most 
part nothing more than a kind of sleep. But it is a sleep during 
which people want to obey another and know that the hypnotist 
wants to make them sleep. A simple form of the same thing is 
when parents say, 'That's enough - now go to sleep!' and the 
children obey. Hypnotism, too, works because the subjects are 
obedient. The ease with which individuals may be hypnotized is 
in proportion to their obedience. 
In hypnotism we have an opportunity to make people imagine 
scenes, ideas, or memories that would be blocked by their waking 
inhibitions. The only requirement is obedience. By this method 
we can often discover early memories that h a y  have been 
forgotten before. 
As a method of treatment and cure, hypnotism has its dangers, 
however. I do not like hypnotism, and use it only when a patient 
responds to no other method. One will find that hypnotized 
people can be rather vengeful. In the beginning they appear to 
overcome their difficulties, but they do not really change their life

Principles of Education 
How shall we educate our children? This is perhaps the most 
important question in our present social life, and it is a question 
to which Individual Psychology has a great deal to contribute. 
Education, whether carried on in the home or at school, is an 
attempt to bring out and direct the personalities of individuals. 
The science of psychology is thus a necessary basis for proper 
educational technique; we may look upon all education as a 
branch of that vast psychological art of living. 
Let us begin with certain preliminaries. The most general 
principle of education is that it must be consistent with the later 
life that individuals will be called upon to face. This means that 
it must be consistent with the ideals of the nation. If we do not

to encounter difficulties later in life. They will not fit in as 
members of society. 
The ideals of a nation may change - they may change suddenly, 
such as after a revolution, or gradually, in a process of evolution. 
But this simply means that the educator should keep in mind a 
very broad ideal. It should be an ideal that will always have its 
place, and will teach individuals to adjust themselves properly to 
changing circumstances. 
The connection of education with social ideals is influenced 
by its connection with the rule of government, and it is in 
the government's interest that national ideals should be re- 
flected in the school system; the government cannot readily 
reach the parents or the family, but it monitors what is 
happening in schools. 
Historically, schools have reflected different ideals at different 
periods. In Europe schools were originally established for aristo- 
cratic families and were aristocratic in spirit. Later on, schools 
were taken over by the church, and only priests were teachers. 
Then the nation's demands for more knowledge began to increase; 
more subjects were taught and a greater number of teachers was 
needed than the church could supply. So others besides priests 
and clergymen entered the teaching profession.

The beginning of the modern spirit of education came in 
Europe in Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi's time. Pestalozzi was a 
Swiss educational reformer, and the first teacher to promote 
methods other than the rod and punishment. He showed the great 
importance of proper methods in schools. With correct methods, 
every child - unless he or she has learning difficulties - can learn 
to read, to write, to sing, and to do arithmetic. We cannot say 
that we have already discovered the best methods; they are in the 
process of development all the time. As is right and proper, we 
are always searching for new and better methods. 
Formerly in Europe only aristocrats were influential, and there 
was a demand only for officials on the one hand and for labourers 
on the other. Those who had to be prepared for higher station 
went to school; the rest had no education at all. The educational 
system reflected the ideals of the time. Today, the school system 
responds to a different set of national ideals. We no longer have 
schools in which children must sit quietly, hands folded in their 
laps, and not move. Now we have schools in which the children 
are the teacher's friends. They are no longer compelled by author- 
ity merely to obey, but are encouraged to develop more inde- 
pendently and to think for themselves. 
The connection between the school system and national and 
social ideals is organic - because of its origin and organization, 
as we have seen - but from a psychological point of view it gives 
schools a great advantage as educational agencies. The principal 
aim of education is social adjustment. The school can guide the

family because it is much nearer to the needs of the nation and 
less susceptible to the children's demands and criticism. It does 
not pamper the children, and in general has a much more detached 
attitude. 
The family, on the other hand, is not always permeated with 
social ideals. Too often we find traditional disciplinarian ideas or 
sheer materialism dominating there. Only when the parents are 
themselves socially well adjusted and understand that the aim of 
education must be social can progress be made. Wherever parents 
know and understand these things we will find children properly 
prepared for school, just as in school they are properly prepared 
for their special place in life. This should be the ideal development 
of the child at home and in school, with the school standing 
midway between the family and the nation. 
Understanding Parents and Children 
In previous chapters we have noted that the life style of a child is 
fixed after it is four or five years old and cannot be directly 
changed. This indicates the way in which the modern school must 
progress. It must not criticize or punish, but try to mould, educate 
and develop the social interest of children. The modern school 
cannot work on the principle of suppression and punishment, but 
rather on the idea of trying to understand and solve children's 
personal problems.

united in the family, it is often difficult for parents to educate their

u n d e r s t a n d i n g  l i f e  
children for society. They prefer to educate them for their own 
aspirations, and thereby create a tendency that will cause conflict 
for their children in later life. Such children are bound to face 
great difficulties, and are already confronted with problems the 
moment they enter school. 
To remedy this situation it is necessary to educate parents. 
Often this is not easy, for we don't have access to the elder 
members of the family as we do to the children. And even when 
we reach the parents, we may find that they are not very much 
interested in the ideals of society. They are so concerned with their 
own problems that they do not want to understand. 
Not being able to do much with the parents, we simply have 
to content ourselves with spreading more understanding as best 
we can. The best point of attack is in schools, firstly because large 
numbers of children are gathered there; secondly, because mis- 
takes in the life style appear more clearly there than in the family; 
and, thirdly, because teachers are trained to understand children's 
problems. 
The Superiority Complex in Problem

'Normal' children, if there be such a category, do not concern

develop their sense of superiority. Their superiority feeling, 
precisely because it is on the useful side of life, is not a 
superiority complex. 
On the other hand, problem children, neurotics, delinquents, 
and so on, express a superiority complex as a compensation for 
their feelings of inferiority. These feelings of inferiority, as we 
have shown, exist in all human beings, but only become a complex 
when they discourage people to the point of driving them to 
destructive or useless behaviour. 
All these problems of inferiority and superiority have their root 
in family life during the period before children enter school. It is 
during this period that they have built up their life style, which in 
contrast with the adult life style we have designated as a proto- 
type. This prototype is the unripe fruit, and like all unripe fruit, 
if there is a worm in it, the more it develops and ripens the larger 
the worm grows. 
As we have seen, the difficulty often develops from physical 
problems or organ inferiority. It is not the organic inferiority that 
causes the problem but the social maladjustment it brings in its 
wake. It is here that the educational opportunity lies, because we 
can train people to adjust themselves socially and the organic 
problems may become assets. For as we have seen, a physical 
problem may spark off a very striking interest, developed through 
training, which may rule the individual's whole life, and provided 
this interest runs in a useful channel it may be very advantageous. 
It all depends on the way the organic difficulty fits in with 
social adjustment. Thus in the case of children who are interested

only in seeing, or only in hearing, it is up to the teacher to develop 
their interest in the use of all their senses. Otherwise, they will be 
at a disadvantage compared with other pupils. 
Besides children with imperfect organs, a problem is presented 
by the great number of pampered children who come to school. 
With the way schools are organized, it is impossible for a single 
child always to remain the centre of attention. Occasionally a 
teacher may be so kind and soft-hearted that he panders to 
favourites, but as such children move from class to class they fall 
out of their position of favour. Later in life it is even worse, for 
it is not considered proper for one person always to be the centre 
of attention without doing anything to merit it. 
All such problem children have certain defined characteristics. 
They are not well equipped to meet the problems of life; they are 
very ambitious, and want to achieve success individually, not on 
behalf of society. In addition they are always quarrelsome and at 
loggerheads with others. They are usually cowards, since they lack 
interest in all the problems of life. 
Some Characteristics of Problem Children 
Another characteristic we often discover among such children is 
that they are cautious and continually hesitating. They postpone 
solving the problems that life poses, or else they come to a stop 
altogether when faced with problems, going off at a tangent and 
never finishing anything.

These characteristics come to light more clearly in school than 
in the family. School is like an experiment or acid test, for there 
it becomes obvious whether a child is adjusted to society and its 
problems. A mistaken life style often passes unrecognized at 
home, but it becomes all too readily apparent in school. 
Both the pampered child and the child with physical problems 
always want to 'exclude' the difficulties of life because of their 
great feeling of inferiority, which robs them of the strength to 
cope. However, we may control their difficulties at school, and 
thus gradually put them in a position to solve problems. The 
school thus becomes a place where we really educate, and do not 
merely give instruction. 
We see, then, that whether or not teachers and officials like it, 
an understanding of all these problems and of the best methods 
for handling them must be developed as part of the school 
curriculum. 
Gifted Children 
Besides these problem children, there are also children who are 
believed to be prodigies - the exceptionally bright children. Some- 
times, because they are ahead in some subjects, it is easy for them 
to appear brilliant in others. They are sensitive, ambitious, and not 
usually very well liked by their comrades. Children immediately 
seem to feel whether one of their number is socially well adjusted 
or not. Such prodigies are admired but not highly regarded.

problems. A mistaken life style often passes unrecognized at 
home, but it becomes all too readily apparent in school. 
Both the pampered child and the child with physical problems 
always want to 'exclude' the difficulties of life because of their 
great feeling of inferiority, which robs them of the strength to 
cope. However, we may control their difficulties at school, and 
thus gradually put them in a position to solve problems. The 
school thus becomes a place where we really educate, and do not 
merely give instruction. 
We see, then, that whether or not teachers and officials like it, 
an understanding of all these problems and of the best methods 
for handling them must be developed as part of the school 
curriculum. 
Gifted Children 
Besides these problem children, there are also children who are 
believed to be prodigies - the exceptionally bright children. Some­
times, because they are ahead in some subjects, it is easy for them 
to appear brilliant in others. They are sensitive, ambitious, and not 
usually very well liked by their comrades. Children immediately 
seem to feel whether one of their number is socially well adjusted 
or not. Such prodigies are admired but not highly regarded. 
107 

u n d e r s t a n d i n g  l i f e  
We can understand how many of these gifted children pass 
through school satisfactorily. But when they enter social life they have 
no adequate plan of life. When they approach the three great 
problems of life - society, employment and relationships - their 
difficulties appear. What happened in their prototype years becomes 
apparent, and we see the effect of their not being well adjusted in the 
family. There they continually found themselves in favourable situ- 
ations, which did not bring out the mistakes in their life style. But the 
moment a new situation comes their way, the mistakes appear. 
The solution that Individual Psychology offers for the prob- 
lems of prodigies is the same as that for other problem children. 
The individual psychologist says, 'Everybody can accomplish 
everything.' This is a democratic maxim that takes the pressure 
off prodigies, who are always burdened with expectations, are 
always pushed forward and become too much interested in 
themselves. People who adopt this maxim can have very brilliant 
children who do not become conceited or too ambitious. They 
understand that what they have accomplished was the result of 
training and good fortune. If their good training is continued they 
can accomplish much. But other children, who are less well 
favoured and not as well trained and educated, may also accom- 
plish good things if their teacher can encourage them.

Encourage Children

be protected against their marked feeling of inferiority, a feeling

These latter children may have lost courage, and must therefore

problem c h i l d r e n  
that none of us can suffer for long. One can understand their being 
overwhelmed by difficulties at school and misbehaving or else not 
going to school at all. They believe that there is no hope for them 
at school, and if this were true we should have to agree that they are 
acting consistently and rationally. But Individual Psychology does 
not accept the belief that their case is hopeless at school; it believes 
that everybody can accomplish useful work. There are always 
mistakes, but these can be corrected and the child can go on. 
Often, however, the situation is not handled well. At the very 
time when the child is overwhelmed by new difficulties at school, 
the mother adopts a watching and anxious attitude. Any bad 
school reports, criticisms or scoldings that the child gets at school 
are magnified by repercussions at home. Very often children who 
have been well-behaved at home, because they have been pam- 
pered, become badly behaved in school because their latent 
inferiority complex shows up the moment they lose contact with 
the family and are no longer the centre of attention. It is then that 
the pampering mother will be hated by such children because they 
feel deceived. The mother does not appear in the same light as she 
did before. All her old pampering is forgotten in the anxiety of 
the new situation. 
We often find children who are aggressive at home are quiet, 
calm, and even inhibited at school. Sometimes the mother comes 
to school and says, 'This child takes up all my time and attention. 
He is always fighting.' 
The teacher replies, 'He sits quietly all day at school and 
does not move.' This is simply the reverse of the former

situation; the child receives attention at school and for that 
reason is quiet and unassuming. At home he is not the centre 
of attention, and so he fights. 
There is the case, for example, of an eight-year-old girl who 
was very well liked by her schoolmates and was top of her class. 
Her father came to the doctor, saying, 'This child is very sadistic 
- a real tyrant. We can't stand it any longer.' What was the 
reason? She was the first child in a weak family. Only a weak 
family could be so intimidated by a child. When another child 
was born this girl felt herself in danger, and, still wanting to be 
the centre of attention as before, she began to be aggressive. At 
school she was liked and appreciated, and, not having any reason 
to fight, she developed well. 
Some children have difficulty both at home and in school. 
Both family and school complain, and the result is that the 
children's mistakes increase. Some are chronically untidy at home 
and in school. Now if the behaviour is the same both within the 
family and at school, we must look for the cause in things that 
have gone before. In any case we must always consider behaviour 
both in the family and in school in order to form a judgement 
on children's problems. Every part of their lives becomes impor- 
tant for us if we are correctly to understand their life style and 
the direction in which they are striving. 
It sometimes happens that fairly socially well-adjusted chil- 
dren, when they encounter the new situation school presents, 
may seem unable to cope. This usually happens when children 
come to a school where the teacher and other pupils are hostile.

For example, if children who are not from the upper classes are 
sent to an aristocratic school they may suffer because they are 
regarded as not from the 'right' background and their classmates 
will seem to be against them. Such children, who may previously 
have been pampered, or at least cosseted, suddenly find them- 
selves in a very hostile atmosphere; sometimes the cruelty of other 
children can be astonishing. In many cases children who experi- 
ence this never speak a word about it at home because they feel 
ashamed. They suffer their terrible ordeal in silence. 
Often such children, when they come to the age of sixteen or 
eighteen - the age when they have to behave like adults and face 
life's problems squarely - stop short because they have lost courage 
and hope. And along with their social difficulties go their problems 
in relationships, because they cannot find their place in society. 
What are we to do with such cases? They have no outlet for 
their energies. They are separated, or feel separated from the 
whole world. The type of people who want to hurt themselves for 
the sake of hurting others may commit suicide. On the other hand 
there are also types who want to disappear, and they isolate 
themselves, losing even the few social abilities they once had. They 
do not speak to people in the ordinary way, do not approach 
people, and are always antagonistic towards the world. This state, 
when acute, we call schizophrenia. If we are to help any of these 
people we must find a way to rebuild their courage. They are very 
difficult cases, but they can be cured.

is appropriate to review here the methods that Individual Psycho- 
logy has developed for this diagnosis. The diagnosis of the life 
style is of course useful for many other things besides education, 
but it is quite essential in educational practice. 
Besides direct study of children during their formative years, 
Individual Psychology uses the methods of asking children for 
early memories and for their plans concerning a future occupa- 
tion, observes posture and movement, and makes certain infer- 
ences from the child's place in the family. We have discussed all 
these methods before, but it is perhaps necessary to emphasize 
again the position of the child in the family, as this is the most 
closely connected with educational development. 
Birth Order and Family Dynamics 
The important thing about the order of children in the family is, 
as we have seen, that a first child is for a while in the position of 
an only child and is later dethroned from that position. He or she 
thus enjoys great power for a while, only to lose it. The psycho- 
logy of the other children is fixed and determined by the fact that 
they are not first children. 
Among eldest children we often find that a conservative view 
prevails. They have the feeling that those in power should remain 
in power; it is only an accident that they have lost their own power 
and they have great admiration for powerful people. 
Second children are in an entirely different situation. They go

running ahead of them. They always want to catch up. They do 
not recognize the sanctity of authority, but think it should change 
hands. They feel an impulse to go forward urgently, as in a race. 
All their movements show that they are fixing their attention on 
a point ahead in order to catch up with it. They are always trying 
to change the laws of science and nature, and are really revolu- 
tionary - not so much politically, but in social life and in their 
attitude towards their fellow human beings. We have a good 
example of this in the biblical story of Jacob and Esau. 
The position of the youngest in the family is of remarkable 
interest from a psychological point of view. By youngest we mean 
of course children who will always be the youngest and will never 
have any successors. Such children are in an advantageous posi- 
tion since they can never be dethroned. Second children may be 
dethroned, and sometimes they experience the same tragedy as 
first children, but this can never happen in the life of youngest 
children. They are therefore the most favourably situated, and, 
other circumstances being equal, we find that these children show 
the best development. They resemble second children in that they 
are very energetic and try to overcome others; they too, have 
pacemakers. But in general they take an entirely different path 
from the rest of the family. If the family includes several scientists, 
the youngest will probably work in the arts or commerce. If the 
family runs a business, the youngest may become a poet. Youngest 
children must always be different. For it is easier to work in 
another area than to have to compete in the same field of 
employment, and for that reason youngest children like to follow

a different line from the rest. This is also a sign that they are 
somewhat lacking in courage, for were such children courageous, 
they would be more willing to compete in the same field. 
It should be noted that our predictions of character based on 
the position of children in the family are merely tendencies; there 
is no certainty about them. And in fact if a first child is bright, he 
or she may not at all be conquered by the second, and thus will 
not suffer any tragedy. Such children are socially well adjusted, 
and their mother is likely to have encouraged their interest 
towards others, including the new-born baby. On the other hand, 
if a first child cannot be conquered this poses a greater problem 
for the second, and this second child may experience difficulties. 
Such second children often lose courage and hope. We know that 
children competing in a race must always have the hope of 
winning; when this hope is gone, all is lost. 
Where there are several children who are nearly grown up 
before another is born, the last child finds himself in a situation 
similar to that of an only child. Only children also have their 
tragedy, for they have been the centre of attention in the family 
throughout their childhood, and their goal in life is always to be 
at the centre. They do not reason along logical lines, but along 
the lines of their own life style. 
The position of an only boy among a family of girls is also 
difficult. It is commonly supposed that such a boy will behave in 
a girlish manner, but this view is rather exaggerated. After all, 
most of us are educated and cared for predominantly by women.

whole family in such a case is established both for and by women. 
A boy in such an environment may strive to appear more of a man 
and exaggerate this feature of his character; or else he may indeed 
grow feminine like the rest of the household. In short, we will 
usually find that such a boy is either soft and mild or else very 
aggressive. In the latter case it would seem that he is always trying 
to prove and emphasize the fact that he is a man. 
The only girl among boys is in an equally difficult situation. 
Either she is very quiet and develops strong femininity, or she 
wants to do everything that the boys do and to behave like them. 
A feeling of inferiority is quite apparent in such a case, since she 
is the only girl in a situation where boys are felt to be superior. 
The inferiority complex lies in the feeling that she is only a girl. 
In this word 'only' the whole inferiority complex is expressed. 
We see the development of a compensating superiority complex 
when she tries to dress like the boys and when, later in life, she 
wants to have the kind of sexual relations that she understands 
men have. 
We may conclude our discussion of the position and gender of 
children in a family with the particular case where the first child 
is a boy and the second a girl. Here there is usually fierce 
competition between the two. The girl is pushed forward not only 
because she is the second child but also because she is a girl. She 
makes more effort and thus shows very markedly the charac-

rapidly both physically and mentally than boys - a girl of twelve, 
for instance, is much more mature than a boy of the same age. 
The boy sees this and cannot explain it. Hence he feels inferior 
and has a longing to give up. He does not progress and starts 
looking for ways of escape. Sometimes he develops a constructive 
way of escape, and in other cases he may become neurotic, 
criminal, or insane. He does not feel strong enough to carry on 
with the race. 
This type of situation is a difficult one to solve even with the 
attitude that 'everybody can accomplish everything'. The main 
thing we can do is to show the boy that if the girl seems to be 
ahead it is only because she makes more effort, and by working 
harder he can find better methods of development. We can also 
seek to direct the girl and the boy into non-competitive fields, as 
far as possible, so as to diminish the impression that they are 
running a race.

social adjustment 
The Social Context 
The goal of Individual Psychology is social adjustment. This may 
seem a paradox, but if it is a paradox, it is only a verbal one. The 
fact is that it is only when we pay attention to the concrete 
psychological life of the individual that we come to realize how 
all-important the social element is. The individual becomes an 
individual only in a social context. Other systems of psychology 
make a distinction between what they call individual psychology 
and social psychology, but for us there is no such distinction. Our 
discussions hitherto have attempted to analyse the individual life 
style but the analysis has always been from a social point of view 
and had a social application. 
We will now continue our analysis with more emphasis on 
the problems of social adjustment. The principles to be dis-

and the methods for furthering proper action. 
The analysis of social problems builds directly on our analysis of 
educational problems, the theme of the previous chapter. The school 
and nursery are miniature social institutions, and we can study there 
the problems of social maladjustment in a simplified form.

Take the behavioural problems of a boy of five. His mother came 
to the doctor complaining that her son was restless, hyperactive, 
and very troublesome. She was always at full stretch trying to 
control him and at the end of the day she was exhausted. She said 
she could not cope with the boy any more and was willing to have 
him taken into care if such action was advisable. 
From these details we can readily 'identify' with the boy - we 
can easily put ourselves in his place. If we hear that a child of five 
is hyperactive, we have no difficulty imagining what his behaviour 
would be like: he would climb over the furniture, and would 
always want to be dirty and getting into trouble. If his mother 
wanted to read, he would play with the lights; or if his mother 
and father wanted to talk or listen to music he would yell. He 
would have temper tantrums if he did not get what he wanted, 
and he would always be wanting something. 
If we note such behaviour in a young boy, we may be sure that 
he wants to fight and that everything he does is designed to 
provoke a fight. He is restless day and night, while his father and 
understanding 
life 
on diagnosing life styles, we shall discuss life styles in action 
and the methods for furthering proper action. 
The analysis of social problems builds directly on our analysis of 
educational problems, the theme of the previous chapter. The school 
and nursery are miniature social institutions, and we can study there 
the problems of social maladjustment in a simplified form.

1 1 8

mother are always tired. The boy is never tired because, unlike 
his parents, he does not have to do anything against his will. He 
simply wants to be restless and keep others occupied. 
A particular incident well illustrates how this particular boy 
fought to be the centre of attention. One day he was taken to a 
concert at which his mother and father played the piano and sang. 
In the middle of a song the boy called out, 'Hello Daddy!' and ran 
all around the hall. One could have predicted this, but the mother 
and father did not understand the reason for such behaviour. They 
treated him as a normal child, in spite of the fact that he did not 
behave normally. 
To this extent he was, however, normal: he had an intelligent 
life plan. What he did was cleverly done, in accordance with his 
plan. And if we see the plan we can guess the actions that would 
result from it. Hence we may conclude that the boy is not lacking 
in intelligence. 
When his mother had visitors, he would push them off their chairs 
and always wanted the particular chair upon which someone was 
about to sit. We see how this, too, is consistent with his goal and with 
his prototype. His goal is to be superior and to rule others, and always 
to occupy the attention of his father and mother. 
We can judge that he used to be a pampered child, and that, 
were he to be pampered again, he would not fight. In other words, 
he is a child who has lost his favoured position. 
How did he lose it? The answer is, he must have acquired a 
younger brother or sister. He is thus a five-year-old in a new 
situation, dethroned and fighting to regain his important central

position, which he believes he has lost. For that reason he always 
keeps his father and mother busy. But there is another reason. 
One can see that the boy has not been prepared for the new 
situation and that in his life as a pampered child he did not develop 
any social feeling. He is thus not socially well adjusted. He is 
interested only in himself and occupied only with his own welfare. 
When his mother was asked how her son behaved towards his 
younger brother, she insisted that he liked him, but that whenever 
he played with him he always accidentally pushed him over. We 
might be pardoned for assuming that such actions do not indicate 
marked affection. 
To fully understand the significance of this behaviour we 
should compare it to the cases we frequently meet of aggres- 
sive children who do not fight all the time. The children are 
too intelligent to fight continuously, for they know that the 
father and mother would put an end to their fighting. Hence 
such children from time to time stop their fighting and put 
on their best behaviour. But the old impulse reappears, as it 
does in this case when, in the course of playing with his 
younger brother, the boy pushes him over. His goal in playing 
is, in fact, to push the child over. 
Now what is the boy's behaviour towards his mother? If she 
tries to smack him, he either laughs and insists that the smack 
does not hurt him; or else, if she hits him a little harder, he 
becomes quiet for a while, only to begin his fighting again a little 
later. One should notice how all the boy's behaviour is 
conditioned by his goal and how everything he does is without

exception directed towards it - so much so that we can predict 
his actions. We could not predict them if the prototype were not 
a unity, or if we did not know the goal of the prototype's impulses. 
Imagine this boy starting out in life. He goes to nursery school, 
and we can predict what will happen there. In general he will rule 
in a weak environment or, in a more difficult one, he will fight in 
an attempt to rule. And so his stay at nursery school is likely to 
be short if the teacher is severe. In that case the boy might try to 
find subterfuges, and would be constantly under tension; this 
tension might make him suffer headaches, restlessness, and so on. 
The symptoms would appear as the first signs of a neurosis. 
On the other hand, if the environment were easy and pleasant, he 
might feel that he was the centre of attention. Under such circum- 
stances he might even be at the top of the class - the champion. 
Nursery school, as we can see, is a social institution with social 
problems. Individuals must be prepared for such problems be- 
cause they have to follow the laws of the community. Children 
must be able to make themselves useful to that little community, 
and they cannot be useful unless they are more interested in others 
than in themselves. 
In later years at school, the same situation would be repeated, 
and we can imagine what would happen to problem children of 
this sort. Things might be a little easier if they were sent to private 
school, as these often have fewer pupils, to whom more attention 
can be paid. Perhaps in such an environment problem children 
could be less noticeable. Teachers might even find them to be their 
best pupils. It is also possible that if a child like this were at the

u n d e r s t a n d i n g  l i f e  
top of the class, his or her behaviour at home might change - he 
or she might be satisfied to be superior in this way only. 
Adiusting to School 
In cases where children's behaviour improves after they go to 
school, one may take it for granted that they have a favourable 
situation in their class and feel superior there. Usually, however, 
the opposite is true. Children who are very much loved and very 
obedient at home often disrupt the class at school. 
In the last chapter we discussed the school as standing midway 
between the home and life in society. If we apply that formula 
we can understand what happens to such children when they go 
out into life. Life will not offer them the favourable situation 
they may sometimes find in school. People are often surprised 
and cannot understand how children who are well-behaved at 
home and successful at school should have problems in later life. 
We are here dealing with problem adults who have a neurosis 
that may later become serious. No one understands such cases 
because the prototype has been concealed by favourable situ- 
ations until adult life. 
We must learn, therefore, to recognize the mistaken prototype 
in a favourable situation, or at least to realize that it may exist, 
since it is very difficult to understand it in such circumstances. 
There are a few signs that may be taken as definite indications of 
a mistaken prototype. Children who want to attract attention and 
who are lacking in social interest will often be untidy; by being

1 22 

social a d j u s t m e n t  
untidy, they occupy other people's time. They will also not want 
to go to sleep, and will cry out at night or wet the bed. They play 
at anxiety because they have noticed that anxiety is a weapon by 
which they may force others to obey them. All these signs appear 
even in favourable situations, and by looking for them one is likely 
to spot any problems. 
Facing the Three Tasks of Life 
Let us consider a boy with such a mistaken prototype later in life, 
when he is on the verge of maturity - say at seventeen or eighteen. 
There is a great hinterland of life behind him - a hinterland that 
is not easily evaluated because it is not very distinct. It is not easy 
to see the goal and the life style. But as he faces life he has to meet 
what I have called the three great tasks of life - the task of building 
successful human relationships, that of pursuing a socially useful 
occupation, and that of intimate relationships. These tasks arise 
out of the social relationships bound up in our very existence; the 
first involves our behaviour towards other people, our attitude to 
humankind and its future. This involves the preservation and the 
salvation of our species, for human life is so precarious that we 
can survive only if we pull together. 
As regards occupation in this case, we can judge from what we 
have seen of the boy's behaviour at school that if he seeks an 
occupation with the idea of being superior, he will have difficulty 
in obtaining it. It is difficult to find a position where one will not 
sometimes be subordinate, or where one will not have to work

with others. But as this boy is interested only in his own welfare, 
he will never get along well in a subordinate position, and 
moreover, such a person does not prove very trustworthy in 
business. He can never subordinate his own interests to the 
interests of the firm. 
In general we may say that success in an occupation is depend- 
ent on effective social adjustment. It is a great advantage in 
business to be able to understand the needs of colleagues and 
customers, to see with their eyes, hear with their ears, and feel as 
they feel. Such empathetic people will get ahead, but the boy we 
are studying cannot do so, for he is always looking out solely for 
his own interests. He can do only a part of what is necessary for 
progress. Hence he will often be a failure in his occupation. 
In most cases one will find that such people never complete 
their training for an occupation, or, at least, are late in taking up 
a career. They are perhaps thirty years old, and still do not know 
what they intend to do in life. They frequently change from one 
course of study to another, or from one type of job to another. 
Sometimes we find girls or boys of seventeen or eighteen who 
are striving, but do not know what direction to take. It is 
important to be able to understand such people and to advise them 
regarding the choice of a vocation. They can still become inter- 
ested in something, study it from the beginning and train properly. 
But it is rather disturbing to find people of this age not knowing 
what they want to do in later life. They are too often the type who 
do not accomplish much. Both at home and at school efforts ought 
to be made to interest children in their future occupations long

before they reach this age. In school and college this might be 
achieved by having discussion groups or giving assignments on 
possible career options. 
The last question that young people have to face is that of love, 
marriage and intimate relationships in general. Inasmuch as 
human beings live as two sexes, this is an all-important question. 
It would be very different if there were only one gender. As it is, 
we have to learn how to behave towards the other sex. We shall 
discuss the question of love and marriage at length in a later 
chapter: here it is only necessary to show the connection between 
personal relationships and the problems of social adjustment. The 
same lack of social interest that is responsible for social and 
occupational maladjustments is also responsible for the common 
inability to form good relationships with the other sex. A person 
who is exclusively self-centred does not have the proper prepara- 
tion for being half of a couple. Indeed it would seem that one of 
the chief purposes of the sex instinct is to pull individuals out of 
their shells and prepare them for social life. But psychologically 
we have to meet the sex instinct half-way - it cannot accomplish 
its function properly unless we are already predisposed to forget 
our own selves and merge into a larger life. 
The Need to Build Character 
We may now draw some conclusions about this boy we have been 
studying. We have seen him confronted by the three great tasks 
of life, despairing and afraid of defeat. We have seen him with his

personal goal of superiority excluding as far as possible all the 
questions of life. What, then, is left for him? He will not join in 
society, he is antagonistic to others, he is very suspicious and 
reclusive. And being no longer interested in others, he does not 
care how he appears to them, and so he will often be untidy and 
dirty. Language, we know, is a social necessity, but our subject 
does not wish to use it. He does not speak at all - a trait that is 
found in schizophrenia. 
Defended by a self-imposed barrier against all the questions of 
life, our subject is heading straight for the mental hospital. His 
goal of superiority brings about isolation from others, and it 
perverts his sex drives. We find him sometimes thinking he is Jesus 
Christ or the President of the USA. Only in this way can he 
manage to express his goal of superiority. 
As we have frequently said, all the problems of life are at 
bottom social problems. We see social problems expressed in the 
nursery, the school, in friendship, in politics, in economic life, and 
so on. It is evident that all our abilities are socially focused and 
have the benefit of humankind as their end. 
We know that a deficiency in social adjustment begins in the 
prototype; the question is how to correct this before it is too late. 
If the parents could be told not only how to prevent the big 
mistakes but also how to recognize the small ones in the prototype 
and how to correct them, it would be a great advantage. But the 
truth is that it is not possible to accomplish much in this way. Few 
parents are inclined to learn and to avoid mistakes. They are not

not regard them as perfect jewels, or else they are not sufficiently 
interested. Not much can usually be accomplished through them; 
it is impossible to give them a good understanding in a short 
enough time. It would take a great deal of time to teach parents 
and advise them of what they should know. It is much better, 
therefore, to call in a doctor or psychologist. 
Outside the work of the doctor and psychologist, the best 
results can be accomplished only through schools and education. 
Mistakes in the prototype often do not appear until a child enters 
school, and teachers familiar with the methods of Individual 
Psychology will soon notice a mistaken prototype. They can see 
whether children join the others, or want to be the centre of 
attention by pushing themselves forward, and which children lack 
courage. Well-trained teachers could recognize the mistakes in a 
prototype in the first week. 
Teachers, by the very nature of their social function, are well 
equipped to correct the mistakes of children. Schools were started 
because the family was not able to educate children adequately for 
the social demands of life - the school is the extension of the family, 
and it is there that children's characters are formed to a great 
extent, and where they are taught to face the problems of life. 
All that is necessary is that schools and teachers should be 
equipped with the psychological insight that will enable them to 
perform their task properly. In future, schools will surely make 
more use of the discoveries of Individual Psychology, for the true 
purpose of a school is to build character.

prototype in the first week. 
Teachers, by the very nature of their social function, are well 
equipped to correct the mistakes of children. Schools were started 
because the family was not able to educate children adequately for 
the social demands of life - the school is the extension of the family, 
and it is there that children's characters are formed to a great 
extent, and where they are taught to face the problems of life. 
All that is necessary is that schools and teachers should be 
equipped with the psychological insight that will enable them to 
perform their task properly. In future, schools will surely make 
more use of the discoveries of Individual Psychology, for the true 
purpose of a school is to build character.

Social Usefulness 
We have seen that social maladjustments are caused by the social 
consequences of the sense of inferiority and the striving for 
superiority. The terms 'inferiority complex' and 'superiority com- 
plex' describe the state of affairs after a maladjustment has taken 
hold. These complexes are not in the genes, nor in the blood- 
stream: they simply happen in the course of the interaction 
between individuals and their social environment. 
Why don't such complexes happen in all individuals? All 
individuals have a sense of inferiority, and a striving for success 
and superiority makes up the very life of the psyche. The reason 
not all individuals have complexes is that their feelings of inferi- 
ority and superiority are harnessed by a psychological mechanism

into socially constructive channels. The springs of this mechanism 
are social feeling, courage, and the logic of common sense. 
Let us consider both the functioning and non-functioning of 
this mechanism. As long as the feeling of inferiority is not too 
great, we know that children will always strive to do something 
worthwhile and to work on the useful side of life. Such children, 
in order to gain their ends, are interested in others. Social feeling 
and social adjustment are the right and normal compensations, 
and in a sense it is almost impossible to find anybody - child or 
adult - in whom the striving for superiority has not resulted in 
such development. We can never find anyone who could say truly, 
'I am not interested in others.' They may act this way - as if they 
were not interested in the world - but they cannot justify them- 
selves. They claim, on the contrary, to be interested in others, in 
order to hide their lack of social adjustment. This is mute testi- 
mony to the universality of social feeling. 
Hidden Complexes 
Nonetheless, maladjustments do take place. We can study their 
genesis by considering marginal cases -cases where an inferiority 
complex exists but is not openly expressed because conditions are 
favourable. The complex is then hidden, or at least there is a 
tendency to hide it. If people are not confronted with a difficulty, 
they may seem wholly contented. But if we look closely we shall see 
how they really express - if not in words, at least in attitudes - 
the fact that they feel inferior. This is an inferiority complex, and

people who are suffering from such a complex are always looking 
for relief from the burdens they have imposed upon themselves 
through their self-centredness. 
It is interesting to observe how some people hide their inferi- 
ority complex, while others confess in so many words, 'I am 
suffering from an inferiority complex.' The latter are always 
elated by their confession, and feel better than others because they 
have confessed while others have not. They say to themselves, 'I 
am honest. I do not lie about the cause of my suffering.' But at 
the same time as they confess their inferiority complex, they hint 
at difficulties in their lives or other circumstances that are respon- 
sible for their situation. They may speak of their parents or family, 
of not being well educated, or of some accident or restriction they 
have suffered. 
Often the inferiority complex may be hidden by a superiority 
complex, which acts as compensation. Such people are arrogant, 
impertinent, conceited and snobbish. They attach more weight to 
appearances than actions. 
In the early striving of a person of this type one may find a 
certain nervousness, which is thereafter used to excuse all the 
person's failures. He or she says, 'If I did not suffer from bad 
nerves, what could I not do!' These 'ifs' generally hide an 
inferiority complex. 
An inferiority complex may also be indicated by such charac- 
teristics as slyness, cautiousness, pedantry, avoidance of the larger 
problems of life, and the search for a narrow field of action limited 
by many principles and rules. It is also a sign of an inferiority

complex if people always lean on something, even if they do not 
need to. Such people do not trust themselves, and we will find 
that they develop unusual interests and are always occupied with 
little things, such as collecting trivia. People waste their time in 
this way and always find an excuse for themselves. They train 
themselves too much towards useless things, and this training, 
when prolonged, leads to a compulsion neurosis. 
Symptoms of Neurosis 
An inferiority complex is usually hidden in all problem children, 
no matter what type of problem they present on the surface. Thus, 
to be lazy is in reality to reject the important tasks of life and is a 
sign of a complex. To steal is to take advantage of another; to lie 
is not to have the courage to tell the truth. All these manifestations 
in children have an inferiority complex at their core. 
A neurosis is a well-developed form of inferiority complex. 
What can people not accomplish when they are suffering from an 
anxiety neurosis! They may be constantly wanting to have some- 
one accompany them; if so, they succeed in their purpose. They 
are supported by others and force others to pay attention to them. 
Here we see the transition from an inferiority to a superiority 
complex. Other people must serve! In getting other people to serve 
them, neurotics become superior. 
In all such cases where complexes develop, failure to function 
in social and useful channels is due to a lack of courage. It is this

course. Side by side with lack of courage are the intellectual 
accompaniments of failing to understand the necessity and utility 
of social life. 
All this is most clearly illustrated in the behaviour of 
criminals - who are really cases of inferiority complexes par 
excellence. Criminals are cowardly and stupid; their cowardice 
and social stupidity go together as two sides of the same coin. 
Heavy drinking may be analysed on similar lines. Alcoholics 
seek relief from their problems, and are cowardly enough to be 
satisfied with the relief that comes from the bottle. 
The ideology and intellectual outlook of such people differ 
sharply from the social common sense that accompanies a normal, 
courageous attitude. Criminals, for instance, always make ex- 
cuses for themselves or accuse others. They mention the impossi- 
bility of finding a job, they speak of the cruelty of society in not 
supporting them, or they say that deprivation drove them on. 
When sentenced, they always find excuses like that of a child-mur- 
derer who said, 'It was done by a command from above.' Another 
murderer, upon being sentenced, said, 'What is the use of a boy 
like the one I killed? There are a million other boys.' Then there 
is the 'philosopher', who claims that it is not wrong to kill a mean 
old woman with a lot of money, when so many worthy people 
are starving.

A Case History 
Let us examine an actual clinical case that illustrates how 
social attitudes and goals can be transformed into anti-social 
ones. Our case involves a girl who was nearly fourteen. She 
grew up in a good home where the father, a hardworking 
man, had supported the family as long as he was able to work, 
but his health had failed. The mother was a kind and honest 
woman and was very much interested in her six children. The 
first child was a very intelligent girl, who died at the age of 
twelve. The second girl was sickly, but later recovered and 
took a job to help support the family. The next child was the 
subject of our case history. This girl was always very healthy, 
and since her mother had always been very much occupied 
with the two sick girls and with her husband, she did not have 
much time for this girl - whom we shall call Anne. There was 
a younger boy, who was also highly intelligent, suffering from 
poor health, and as a result Anne found herself squeezed, so 
to speak, in between two very much loved children. She was 
a good child, but felt that she was not as well liked as the 
others, and complained of being slighted and of feeling that 
she was held back. 
In school, however, Anne worked hard and was top of her 
class. But when she was thirteen and a half and went on to high

school, she had a new teacher who did not like her. Perhaps she 
made a bad start; whatever the reason, lack of appreciation made 
her worse. 
She had not been a problem child as long as she had been 
appreciated by her old teacher; she had had good reports and 
had been well liked by her schoolmates. But an individual 
psychologist could have seen even then that something was wrong 
by looking at her friendships. She was always criticizing her 
friends and tended to try to dominate them. She wanted to be 
the centre of attention and to be flattered, but never to be 
criticized herself. 
Anne's goal was to be appreciated, favoured and protected. 
She found she could accomplish this only in school, not at home. 
When she changed schools she found appreciation lacking there, 
too; the teacher scolded her, told her she was badly prepared for 
lessons, and gave her bad reports. Finally she played truant and 
stayed away altogether for several days. When she came back, the 
situation was worse than ever, and in the end the teacher proposed 
that she be expelled from the school. 
Expulsion from school accomplishes nothing. It is a confession 
on the part of the school and the teachers that they cannot solve 
a particular problem. But if they cannot solve the problem, they 
should call in others who perhaps might be able to help. After 
talking with the parents, arrangements might have been made to 
try another school, or another teacher might have got on better 
with Anne. But her teacher did not reason that way; she reasoned, 
'If a child plays truant and does bad work, she must be expelled.'

social Feeling and common sense 
Such reasoning is a manifestation of private logic, not of common 
sense, and common sense is especially vital in a teacher. 
We can guess what happened next. The girl lost her last hold 
on life and felt that everything was falling apart for her. After 
being expelled from school, she lost even the slight amount of 
appreciation she had at home, so she ran away from both home 
and school. She disappeared for many days and nights, and finally 
it was discovered that she had been having an affair with a soldier. 
We can understand why: her goal was to be appreciated, and 
up to this time she had been trying to do useful work, but now 
she had turned away from it. The soldier appreciated her and liked 
her at first. Later, however, the family received letters from her, 
saying that she was pregnant and that she wanted to kill herself. 
This action of writing to her parents was in line with her 
character - she was always turning in the direction in which she 
expected to find appreciation, and eventually came home. She 
knew that her mother would be in despair about her and that she 
would therefore not be scolded. Her family, she felt, would be 
only too glad to take her in again. 
In treating a case of this sort, the skill of identification - the 
ability to place oneself empathetically in the situation of the 
person involved - is all-important. Here is someone who desper- 
ately wants to be appreciated and is struggling towards this one 
goal. We should identify with such people, and ask ourselves, 
'What would I do in that situation?' It is also important to try to 
encourage such people - but always towards useful activities. We 
should try to get them to the point where they say, 'Perhaps I need

a change of school, but I am not stupid. Perhaps I have not tried 
hard enough - perhaps I have not paid enough attention - perhaps 
I tried to do things in my own way too much at school and did 
not understand the teacher.' If it is possible to give a person 
courage, then they will learn to make this effort on the useful side 
of life. It is lack of courage compounded by an inferiority complex 
that causes problems. 
Another person of the same age and in the same position as 
Anne might turn to crime. Such cases are quite common: if 
children lose courage at school, they may drift into criminal 
activity or become a member of a violent group. Such behaviour 
is easily understood. When children lose hope and courage, they 
will begin to play truant, fabricate excuses, not do their home- 
work, and look for places to spend their days away from school. 
In such places they find companions who have followed the same 
path before them, and whom they join. They lose all interest in 
school, and withdraw more and more into a private world.

The inferiority complex is often connected with the idea that a 
person has no special abilities. It is a commonly held fallacy that 
some people are gifted and others are not. Such a view is itself an 
expression of an inferiority complex. According to Individual 
Psychology everybody can accomplish everything, and it is a sign 
of an inferiority complex when a boy or girl despairs of following

social feeling a n d  common sense 
Another aspect of the inferiority complex is the belief in 
inherited characteristics. If it were entirely true that success were 
dependent upon innate ability, then no psychologist could help 
anyone. But in reality success is largely dependent on courage, 
and the task of the psychologist is to transform feelings of despair 
into feelings of hopefulness which rally a person's energies for 
useful effort. 
Sometimes we encounter cases of young people of sixteen or 
so who are expelled from school and commit suicide in despair. 
The suicide is a sort of revenge - an accusation against society. It 
is the individual's way of affirming their own value - in terms of 
their private logic rather than common sense. All that would be 
necessary in such cases would be to win over these young people 
and give them courage. 
We could cite many other examples. Consider a case of a girl, 
eleven years old, who was not liked at home. The other children 
were preferred, and she felt she was not wanted. She became 
peevish, aggressive and disobedient. It is a simple case to analyse. 
The girl felt she was not appreciated, and at first she struggled 
against this, but then she lost hope. One day she stole something 
from a shop. For the individual psychologist, stealing is not so much 
a crime as the enactment of a child's impulse to enrich herself. It is 
not possible to have this impulse unless one feels deprived. The 
girl's stealing was thus the result of her lack of affection at home 
and of her feeling of hopelessness. Children only begin to steal when 
they feel deprived. Such feelings may not reflect the objective facts, 
but are nonetheless the psychological cause of their action.

Another case is that of an eight-year-old boy, an illegitimate, 
unattractive child who was living with foster parents. The foster 
parents did not take good care of him and did not discipline him. 
Sometimes the mother gave him sweets, and this was a bright spot 
in his life. The foster father was an old man, and the couple's own 
child, a girl, was his only pleasure in life. He pampered her 
continually, and always brought home sweets for his little girl, 
but not for the boy. As a result the boy began to steal the sweets 
from her. He stole because he felt deprived, and wanted to enrich 
himself. The father beat him for stealing, but he persisted. One 
might think that the boy showed courage in that he persisted in 
stealing in spite of the beatings, but that is not true - he always 
hoped to escape detection. 
This is a case of a child never experiencing what it means to 
be a valued member of a family. We have to win him over and 
give him the opportunity of living as a member of a community. 
When he learns to identify with others and to put himself in 
others' shoes he will understand how his foster father feels when 
he sees him stealing and how the little girl feels when she discovers 
her sweets are gone. We see here again how lack of social feeling, 
lack of understanding and lack of courage go together to form an 
inferiority complex.

Another case is that of an eight-year-old boy, an illegitimate, 
unattractive child who was living with foster parents. The foster 
parents did not take good care of him and did not discipline him.

intimate relationships 
The Importance of Preparation 
The right preparation for intimate relationships, love and mar- 
riage is first of all to be part of a community and to be socially 
well adjusted. Along with this there should be a certain guidance 
of the sexual instincts, which are apparent from early childhood, 
to find their expression in marriage and a family. 
All the necessary attitudes and inclinations for love and mar- 
riage can be found in the prototype formed in the first years of 
life. By observing the traits of the prototype we are able to put 
our finger on any difficulties that may appear later in adult life. 
The problems that we meet in relationships, love and marriage 
are of the same character as general social problems. There are

understanding life 
regard successful relationships and marriage as a potential para- 
dise in which all things happen according to one's desires. There 
is always work to do, and this work must be accomplished with 
the interests of the partner constantly in mind. 
More than the ordinary problems of social adjustment, mar- 
riage in particular requires an exceptional ability to identify with 
another person. If few people are properly prepared nowadays 
for family life it is because they have never learned to see with the 
eyes, hear with the ears, and feel with the heart of another person. 
Much of our discussion in the previous chapters has centred on 
the type of children who grow up interested only in themselves and 
not in others. Such children cannot be expected to change their 
character overnight with the onset of physical and sexual maturity. 
They will be unprepared for relationships in the same way and for 
the same reasons that they are unprepared for social life. 
Social feeling is slow to develop and grow. Only those who are 
really trained in the direction of social interest from early child- 
hood and who are always striving usefully will develop true social 
feeling. For this reason it is not particularly difficult to recognize 
whether a person is well prepared for life with a partner or not. 
We need only remember what we have already observed, that 
people must be courageous and have confidence in themselves to 
face the problems of life and go on to find solutions; they must 
have colleagues and friends and get along with their neighbours. 
People who do not have these traits cannot be regarded as 
prepared for relationships, love and marriage. On the other hand, 
we may conclude that people are probably ready for such

occupation and are progressing in it. We are judging their 
character by a small sign, but the sign is very significant in that 
it indicates whether or not people have social feeling. 
Equality of the Sexes 
An understanding of the nature of social feeling shows us that the 
problems of love and marriage can be solved satisfactorily only 
on the basis of total equality between the sexes. This fundamental 
give-and-take is vitally important, much more important than 
whether one partner esteems the other. Love by itself does not 
settle the matter, for there are all kinds of love. It is only when 
there is a proper foundation of equality that love will take the 
right course and make marriage a success. 
If either partner wishes to be the boss in a relationship, the 
results are likely to be fatal. Looking forward to a commitment 
with such a view in mind is not the right preparation, and 
subsequent events are likely to prove it. It is not possible to be 
boss in a situation where there is no place for a dominant partner. 
The marriage situation calls for an interest in the other person 
and an ability to put oneself in the other's place.

of social feeling in conjunction with the instinct of sexual attrac- 
tion. As a matter of fact we know that everyone creates in his own 
mind from childhood onwards an ideal picture of a partner. In 
the case of a boy it is very probable that the mother provides the 
model for the ideal woman, and that the boy will look for a similar 
type of partner. Sometimes there may be a state of unhappy 
tension between a boy and his mother, in which case he may look 
for a completely different type of partner. So close is the corre- 
spondence between a child's relationship with his mother and the 
person he afterwards marries that we can observe it in such little 
details as eye colour, figure, colour of hair, and so on. 
We know, too, that if a mother is domineering and represses 
her son, he may not want to act courageously when the time comes 
for becoming emotionally involved, for his sexual ideal is likely to 
be weak and obedient, or, if he is aggressive, he will fight and want 
to dominate his partner. 
We can see how all the characteristics manifested in childhood 
are emphasized and magnified when people face the problem of 
love. We can imagine how people suffering from an inferiority 
complex will behave in sexual matters. Perhaps because they feel 
weak and inferior they will express their feelings by always asking 
for support from other people. Often such types have the motherly 
character as an ideal. Or sometimes, by way of compensating for 
their inferiority, they may take the opposite direction in love and 
become arrogant and aggressive. Then they may select a stubborn 
or quarrelsome partner, finding it more honourable to be the 
conqueror in a difficult battle.

Neither sex can act successfully in this way. It is ridiculous to 
have the sexual relationship reduced to the satisfaction of an 
inferiority or superiority complex, and yet this happens very 
frequently. If we look closely we see that in seeking a partner many 
people are really looking for a victim. They do not understand 
that sexual relationships cannot be exploited for such ends. For 
if one person seeks to dominate, the other will do likewise. As a 
result, a shared life becomes impossible. 
The observation that some people are attempting to satisfy 
their complexes illuminates certain peculiarities in their choice 
of a partner which are otherwise difficult to understand. It tells 
us why some people choose weak, sick, or old partners: they 
choose them because they believe they will have an easier time 
with them. Sometimes they choose someone already married: 
here it is a case of never wanting to make a commitment. 
Sometimes we find people falling in love with two people at the 
same time, because, as I have already remarked, 'two people are 
less than one'. 
We have seen how people who suffer from an inferiority 
complex change their job, refuse to face problems, and never 
finish things. When confronted with the problem of love they act 
similarly. Falling in love with a married person or with two people 
at once is a way of perpetuating habitual indecisiveness. There are 
other ways, too, such as overlong engagements that never result 
in marriage.

The Spoi 
i n g  l i f e  
It Child 
Spoilt children show up in relationships and marriage true to type: 
they want to be pampered by their partners. Such a state of affairs 
may exist without danger in the early stages of a relationship or 
in the first years of marriage, but later it will bring about 
complications. We can imagine what happens when two such 
persons develop a relationship. Both want to be pampered, and 
neither of them wants to play the pamperer. It is as if they each 
stood around expecting something from the other and giving 
nothing. Both have the feeling that they are misunderstood. 
When people feel misunderstood and thwarted, they feel 
inferior and want to escape. Such feelings are extremely bad in 
a relationship or marriage, particularly if a sense of hopelessness 
arises. When this happens the desire for revenge begins to creep 
in; one person wants to disrupt the life of the other. The most 
common way to do this is to be unfaithful. Infidelity is always 
an act of vengeance. True, partners who are unfaithful always 
justify themselves by speaking about love and feelings, but we 
know the value of such feelings and sentiments - they always 
agree with the goal of superiority, and should not be regarded 
as anything but excuses. 
As an illustration we may take the case of a certain pampered 
woman. She married a man who had always felt in the shadow 
of his brother. The man was attracted by the mildness and 
sweetness of this girl, an only child, who in turn expected always 
to be appreciated and the centre of attention. The marriage was

1 44 

quite happy until a child came along. We can predict what 
happened then: the wife still wanted to be the centre of attention 
but was afraid that the child might take her place, and so she was 
not very happy. The husband, on the other hand, also wanted to 
be number one and was afraid that the child would usurp his 
place. As a result, husband and wife became suspicious of one 
another. They did not neglect the child and were quite good 
parents, but they were always expecting that their love for each 
other would decrease. Such a suspicion is dangerous, because if 
one starts to measure every word and every action, it is easy to 
find, or to appear to find, a decrease in affection. In this case, both 
parties found it. 
The husband went on a holiday to Paris and enjoyed himself 
while his wife recuperated from childbirth and looked after the 
baby. He wrote exuberant letters from Paris, telling his wife what 
a good time he was having, how he was meeting all sorts of people, 
and so on. The wife began to feel neglected, became depressed 
and soon began to suffer from agoraphobia. She could not go out 
alone any more. When her husband returned he had to accom- 
pany her everywhere. On the surface at least, it would seem that 
she had attained her goal, and that she was now the centre of 
attention. But nonetheless she had the feeling that if her agora- 
phobia disappeared, her husband would disappear, too, so she 
continued to suffer from agoraphobia. 
During her illness she found a doctor who gave her considerable

Offering Advice 
We see so many mistakes made in relationships and marriage that 
the question inevitably arises, 'Is all this necessary?' We know that 
these mistakes originated in childhood, and we know, too, that it 
is possible to change mistaken life styles by recognizing the 
characteristics of the prototype. One wonders, therefore, whether 
it would not be possible to establish advisory bodies which could 
untangle relationship mistakes using the methods of Individual 
Psychology. Such organizations would consist of trained people 
who would understand how all the events in individuals' lives 
cohere and hang together, and who would have the power of 
sympathetic identification with those seeking advice. 
These organizations would not say: 'You cannot agree - you 
quarrel continuously - therefore you should split up.' For what 
use is splitting up? As a rule people want to become involved or 
marry again and continue the same life style as before. We 
sometimes see people who have broken up time and again, and 
still get involved in new relationships, simply repeating their

proposed marriage or relationship had in it any possibility of 
success. Or they might consult it before separating. 
Mistaken Attitudes 
There are a number of small mistakes beginning in childhood 
which do not seem important until they become involved in a 
committed relationship. For example, some people always 
think they will be disappointed. There are children who are 
never happy and who are constantly in fear of being disap- 
pointed, who either feel that they have been displaced in their 
parents' affections by another, or have experienced an early 
difficulty which has made them superstitiously afraid that 
misfortune may recur. We can see that this fear and expectation 
of disappointment will create jealousies and suspicions in 
relationships and marriage. 
Among women there is a particular difficulty in that they may 
often feel they are only playthings for men, and that men are 
always unfaithful. It is unlikely that people with views like this will 
be able to sustain a happy relationship. Happiness is impossible if 
one party has the fixed idea that the other is likely to be unfaithful. 
From the way in which people always seek advice on love, one 
would judge that it is generally regarded as the most important 
question of life. From the point of view of Individual Psychology, 
however, it is not the most important question, although its 
importance is not to be underestimated. For Individual

Psychology no single question in life is more important than 
another. If people overemphasize the question of love and 
marriage they destroy the harmony of life. 
Perhaps the reason why this question is given such undue impor- 
tance in many people's minds is that, unlike other questions, it is a 
topic on which we do not receive any education. As we have said, 
there are three great questions in life. The first, the social question, 
involves our behaviour with others, and we are taught from the first 
day of our lives how to act in the company of others. We learn these 
things quite early. Likewise, we have a course of training to prepare 
us for our careers. We have teachers to instruct us in the various arts, 
and we have also books that tell us what to do. But where are the 
books that tell us how to prepare for an intimate relationship? To be 
sure, there are a great many dealing with love stories, but we find few 
books dealing with happy marriages. 
Love and marriage have had a bad press from the beginning. 
If we look at the Bible we will find there the story that a woman 
began all the trouble, and that ever since then men and women 
have always experienced problems in their love lives. 
Our education system could certainly be much improved. It 
would be wise to train girls and boys better in the roles of 
marriage - but train them both in such way that they feel equal. 
The fact that women often feel inferior proves that, in this 
particular, our culture has failed. Women often want to overcome 
others and train themselves more than is necessary, becoming 
self-centred. In the future, women must be taught to develop more 
social interest and not to seek benefit exclusively for themselves.

have always experienced problems in their love lives. 
Our education system could certainly be much improved. It 
would be wise to train girls and boys better in the roles of 
marriage - but train them both in such way that they feel equal. 
The fact that women often feel inferior proves that, in this 
particular, our culture has failed. Women often want to overcome 
others and train themselves more than is necessary, becoming 
self-centred. In the future, women must be taught to develop more 
social interest and not to seek benefit exclusively for themselves.

intimate relationships 
But in order to do this, we must first banish superstitions regard- 
ing the privileges of men. 
Danger Signs 
Let us take an example to show how poorly prepared for committed 
relationships some people are. A young man was dancing at a party 
with his pretty fiancee. He happened to drop his glasses, and to the 
utter amazement of the other guests he almost knocked the girl down 
in order to grab them. When a friend asked him, 'What on earth 
were you doing?' he replied, 'I could not let her break my glasses.' 
We can see that this young man was not prepared for marriage, and 
indeed the marriage did not take place. Later in life he visited the 
doctor and said he was suffering from depression, as is often the case 
with people who are too much interested in themselves. 
There are a thousand signs by which one can gauge whether or 
not a person is prepared for marriage. One should not trust a person 
in love who arrives late for a date without an adequate excuse. Such 
action shows a hesitating attitude, and may be a sign of lack of 
preparation for the problems of life. It is also a sign of lack of 
preparation if one half of a couple always wants to educate the other 
or always needs to criticize. To be over-sensitive is a bad sign, since 
it is an indication of an inferiority complex. People who have no 
friends and do not mix well in society are not well prepared for 
emotional life. Delay in choosing a career is also not a good sign. 
Pessimistic people are also ill-fitted, because pessimism betrays a lack 
of courage to face up to situations.

understanding l i f e  
Despite this list of undesirables it should not be so difficult to 
choose the right person, or rather to choose a person along the 
right lines - we cannot expect to find an ideal person. And indeed, 
if we see someone searching for an ideal partner and never finding 
him or her, we may be sure that such a person is suffering from 
chronic hesitancy. 
Marriage as a Social Task 
In conclusion, let me repeat that questions of relationships, love 
and marriage can be solved only by socially adjusted persons. 
Mistakes are, in the majority of cases, due to lack of social feeling, 
and these mistakes can be obviated only if people change. 
A relationship is a task for two. We are educated, however, 
either for tasks that can be performed alone or for ones that rely 
on groups of people - never for a task that takes two. But despite 
our lack of education, relationships and marriage can be handled 
properly if the partners recognize the mistakes in their character 
and approach things in a spirit of equality. 
It is almost unnecessary to add that the highest form of 
relationship is monogamy. There are many people who claim on 
pseudo-scientific grounds that polygamy is better adapted to 
human nature, but this cannot be accepted, because in our culture 
love and marriage are social tasks. We do not have relationships 
for our private good only, but indirectly for the social good. In 
the last analysis, marriage is for the sake of the race.

Fact and Superstition 
We discussed the normal problems of relationships, love and 
marriage in the preceding chapter. We turn now to a more specific 
area of the same general question - problems of sexuality and 
their bearing upon real or imagined abnormalities. We have 
already seen that most people are less well prepared and less well 
trained for successful sexual relationships than for other life skills. 
In the whole question of human sexuality it is extraordinary how 
many superstitions still need to be laid to rest. 
The most common superstition concerns inherited 
characteristics - the belief that there are degrees of sexuality which 
are of genetic origin and cannot be changed. The concept of 
inheritance can easily be used as an excuse or a subterfuge to avoid

some of the opinions that are advanced on behalf of science, which 
are often taken too seriously by the average layperson. Scientists

factors. 
Childhood Sexuality 
Sexuality manifests itself very early in life. Any carer or parent 
who observes closely enough can see that in the first days after 
birth there are already certain sexual impulses. However, this 
display of sexuality is much more dependent upon environment 
than one might expect. When children begin to express themselves 
sexually, parents should find ways to distract them. Often, how- 
ever, they do not provide the right type of distraction. We have 
seen that children may develop a strong interest in other organs 
of the body, if natural development is impaired or if attitudes are 
mistaken, and the sex organs are no exception. But if one begins 
early enough it is possible to train children correctly. 
In general, some sexual expression in childhood is quite nor- 
mal, and we should not be concerned by it. Our policy should 
therefore be one of watching and waiting, and standing by to see 
that sexual expression does not develop in an unhealthy direction.

characteristic, so that if children happen to be more interested in 
their own sex than in the other sex, this is considered to be a factor 
in their genetic make-up. But this is a tendency that develops from 
day to day. Sometimes children or adults show signs of sex 
perversion, and here again, many people believe this to be genetic. 
But if this is the case, why do such people train themselves? Why 
do they dream about and rehearse their actions? 
Some people's sexual development stops at a certain age, and 
this fact can be explained along the lines of Individual Psychology. 
There are, for example, those who fear defeat because they have 
an inferiority complex. Others develop so strongly that the result 
is a superiority complex, and in a case of this kind we note 
exaggerations that suggest overstressed sexuality. Such people 
may possess greater sexual potency. 
This type of development may be specially stimulated by the 
environment. We know how pictures, books, films, or certain 
social contacts tend to overstress the sex drive. In the modern 
world one may say that almost everything tends to develop an 
exaggerated interest in sex. It is unnecessary to play down the 
great importance of these natural drives and of the part they play 
in love, marriage and procreation, in order to assert that sex is 
overemphasized these days. 
It is the exaggeration of sexuality that is most to be guarded 
against by parents. Too often a mother pays too much attention 
to the first manifestations of sexuality in childhood, and thereby 
tends to make the child overvalue their significance. She is always 
talking to the child about these matters and punishing him or her.

Now, we know that many children like to be the centre of 
attention, and hence it is frequently the case that children continue 
in these habits precisely because they are scolded for them. It is 
better not to stress the subject with children, but to treat the 
matter like any other, and show children that one is not preoccu- 
pied with these things. A mother often expresses her affection for 
her child in kisses, embraces, and so on. Such things are healthy 
but should not be overdone, because a pampered child does not 
develop well sexually. 
The Life Style and Sexua 1 i ty 
Many doctors and psychologists believe that the development of 
sexuality is the basis for the development of the whole mind and 
psyche, as well as for all physical development. In my view this is 
not true. On the contrary, the whole form and development of 
sexuality is dependent upon the personality - the life style and the 
prototype. 
Thus, for example, if we know that a child expresses his or her 
sexuality in a certain way, or that another child suppresses it, we 
may guess what will happen to both of them in their adult life. If 
we know that the child always wants to be the centre of attention 
and to be boss, then he or she will also develop sexually so as to 
dominate and be the centre of attention. 
Many people believe that they are superior and dominant 
when they express their sexual instincts polygamously. They 
therefore have sexual relationships with many partners, and it is

easy to see that they deliberately overstress their sexual desires for 
psychological reasons. The resultant illusion that they are con- 
querors serves as a compensation for an inferiority complex. 
It is the inferiority complex that is at the core of sexual 
abnormalities. A person who suffers from an inferiority com- 
plex is always looking for the easiest way out, and sometimes 
finds this by excluding most aspects of life and exaggerating 
sexuality. 
In children we often find this tendency among those who crave 
the attention of others. They monopolize their parents' and 
teachers' attention by creating difficulties for them, and later in 
life they try to dominate others and wish to be sexually superior. 
Such children grow up confusing sexual desire with the desire 
for conquest and superiority. Sometimes, in rejecting some of the 
possibilities and problems of life, they may reject the other sex 
entirely and self-train for homosexuality. An overstressed sexu- 
ality is often used as an insurance against having to face the 
problem of living out a conventional sex life. 
We can understand all this only if we understand a person's 
life style. These people want to have much attention paid to them, 
and yet believe themselves incapable of sufficiently interesting the 
other sex. Their inferiority complex in regard to the other sex may 
be traced back to childhood. For instance, if a boy found the 
behaviour of girls in the family and the behaviour of his mother 
more attractive than his own, he may have come to believe that 
he would never have the power to interest women. Other indi- 
viduals may admire the other sex so much that they begin to

and women who want to be like men. 
A Criminal Case 
There is a case of a man accused of sadism and of sexual acts 
against children which illustrates the formation of the tendencies 
we have been discussing. Inquiring into his development, we learn 
that he had a dominant mother who was always criticizing him. 
Despite this he developed into a good and intelligent pupil at 
school, but his mother was never satisfied with his success. For 
this reason he wanted to exclude his mother from his affections, 
and was not interested in her, but occupied himself with his father. 
We can see how such a child might form the idea that women 
are severe and hypercritical and that contact with them is not to 
be made for pleasure but only out of necessity. In this way he 
came to exclude the other sex from his life. But he was also of the 
type who becomes sexually aroused when afraid. Suffering from 
anxiety and being thus stimulated, this type of person may later 
in life like to punish or torture himself, or see a child tortured, or 
just imagine himself or another being tortured. He will find sexual 
satisfaction only in the course of these real or imaginary tortures. 
The case of this man indicates the drastic results of the wrong 
kind of training. The man never understood the reasons behind 
his habits, or if he did, he only saw them when it was too late. Of 
course it is very difficult to start to train a person properly at the 
age of twenty-five or thirty. The right time is early childhood.

But in childhood, matters are complicated by psychological 
relations with the parents. It is curious to see how bad sexual 
training results from the psychological conflict between child and 
parent. An aggressive child, especially in the period of adoles- 
cence, may abuse sexuality with the deliberate intention of hurting 
the parents. Boys and girls have been known to have sex just after 
a fight with their parents. Children use these means to revenge 
themselves on their parents, particularly when they see that their 
parents are sensitive on this subject. An aggressive child, particu- 
larly, may well take this line of attack. The only way such tactics 
can be avoided is to make all children responsible for themselves, 
so that they should not believe that it is the parents' interest alone 
which is at stake, but their own as well. 
Besides the influence of childhood environment as reflected in 
the life style, the political and economic conditions in a country 
have their influence on sexuality. Certain conditions give rise to 
a social style which can be very contagious. One finds an exag- 
geration of sexuality during a revolution or other extreme social 
disturbance, and it is of course notorious that in wartime there is 
widespread recourse to sensuality because life seems precarious 
and worthless.

It has been remarked that man is the only animal that eats when

relations at all times. The over-indulgence of the sexual instinct 
1 57 

u n d e r s t a n d i n g  l i f e  
is similar to the over-indulgence of other urges. When any appetite 
is over-indulged and any interest is overdeveloped, this interferes 
with the harmony of life. Psychologists' records are full of cases 
where people develop interests or appetites to the point where 
they become a compulsion. Cases of misers who overstress the 
importance of money are familiar to us all, but there are also 
people who think cleanliness is all-important. They put washing 
ahead of all other activities and even spend the whole day and 
half the night washing. Then there are people who insist on the 
paramount importance of eating. They eat all day long, are 
interested only in food, and talk about nothing but eating. 
The cases of sexual excess are precisely the same. They lead to 
an imbalance in the harmony of human activity, and inevitably 
drag the whole life style towards useless activities. 
In the proper training of the sex instincts, sexual drives should 
be harnessed to a useful goal in which the whole of our character 
is expressed. If the goal is properly chosen neither sexuality nor 
any other single aspect of life will be overemphasized. 
On the other hand, while it is important that all appetites and 
interests are controlled and harmonized, there is danger in com- 
pletely suppressing any of them. Just as in the matter of food, 
when people diet to excess their mind and body suffer, so, too, in 
the matter of sex complete abstinence is undesirable. 
What this implies is that in a normal life style sex will find its 
proper expression. It does not mean that we can overcome 
neuroses, which are the marks of an unbalanced life style, merely 
by free, unrestrained sexual expression. The belief, so widely

1 58 

sexuality a n d  s e x u a l  p r o b l e m s  
propagated, that a suppressed libido is the cause of neurosis is 
untrue. Rather it is the other way around: neurotic people do not 
find their proper sexual expression. 
One meets people who have been advised to give free rein to 
their sex instincts and who have followed that advice, only to 
make their condition worse. The reason things work out that way 
is that such people fail to integrate their sexual life with a socially 
useful goal, which is the only thing that can improve their neurotic 
condition. The expression of the sex instinct alone does not cure 
the neurosis, for the neurosis is a disease of the life style, and it 
can be cured only by ministering to the life style. 
For the individual psychologist all this is so clear that he does 
not hesitate to say a happy marriage or committed partnership is 
the only satisfactory solution for sexual problems. A neurotic does 
not look favourably on such a solution, because a neurotic is 
always a coward and not well prepared for social life. Similarly, 
people who overstress sexuality, who talk of polygamy and of 
open relationships or trial marriage, are trying to escape the social 
solution to the question of sex. They have no resources for solving

the most difficult is in fact the most direct. 
s e x u a l i ty a n d  s ex u a l  problems 
propagated, that a suppressed libido is the cause of neurosis is 
untrue. Rather it is the other way around: neurotic people do not 
find their proper sexual expression. 
One meets people who have been advised to give free rein to 
their sex instincts and who have followed that advice, only to 
make their condition worse. The reason things work out that way 
is that such people fail to integrate their sexual life with a socially 
useful goal, which is the only thing that can improve their neurotic 
condition. The expression of the sex instinct alone does not cure 
the neurosis, for the neurosis is a disease of the life style, and it 
can be cured only by ministering to the life style. 
For the individual psychologist all this is so clear that he does 
not hesitate to say a happy marriage or committed partnership is 
the only satisfactory solution for sexual problems. A neurotic does 
not look favourably on such a solution, because a neurotic is 
always a coward and not well prepared for social life. Similarly, 
people who overstress sexuality, who talk of polygamy and of 
open relationships or trial marriage, are trying to escape the social 
solution to the question of sex. They have no resources for solving 
the problem of social adjustment on the basis of mutual co-op­
eration between husband and wife, and dream of escape through 
the use of some new formula. Often, however, the road that seems 
the most difficult is in fact the most direct.

chapter thirteen 
It is time now to conclude our survey. The method of Individual 
Psychology begins and ends with the problem of inferiority, which 
is the basis for human striving and success. On the other hand, 
the sense of inferiority is also the basis for all our problems of 
psychological maladjustment. When an individual does not find 
a proper concrete goal of superiority, an inferiority complex 
results, leading to a desire for escape. This desire for escape is 
expressed in a superiority complex, which is nothing more than 
a useless, vain goal offering the satisfaction of false success. 
These are the dynamics of psychological life. We know that 
mistakes in the functioning of the psyche are more harmful at 
certain times than at others. We know that the life style is 
crystallized in tendencies formed in childhood - in the prototype 
that develops by the age of four or five. And this being so, the 
whole burden of encouraging a healthy psychological life rests on 
proper childhood guidance, where the principal aim should be the

cultivation of proper social feeling in terms of useful and healthy 
goals. It is only by training children to fit in with the social scheme 
that the natural human sense of inferiority is properly harnessed 
and is prevented from engendering either an inferiority or a 
superiority complex. 
Social adjustment is the other side of the coin of the inferiority 
problem. It is because the individual is inferior and weak that we 
find human beings living together in society. Social interest and 
social co-operation are therefore the salvation of the individual.

glossary of key terms 
Individual Psychology The study of the individual as an indivisible 
whole, as a unitary, goaldirected self, who in the normal, healthy state 
is a full member of society and a participant in human relationships. 
Inferiority complex Feelings of inferiority or inadequacy that pro- 
duce stress, psychological evasions and a compensatory drive towards 
an illusory sense of superiority. 
Life style A key concept in Individual Psychology: the complex of an 
individual's personal philosophy, beliefs and characteristic approach to 
life, and the unifying feature of her personality. The life style represents 
an individual's own creative response to early experiences, which in 
turn influences all her perceptions of herself and the world, and thus her 
emotions, motives and actions. It was in this present work that Adler 
formally introduced the term 'life style' instead of earlier expressions 
such as the 'guiding line' and the 'life plant. 
Masculine protest A reaction, by either sex, to the preiudices of our

constitute a protest against the demands made on him by the myths of 
male superiority; a woman's may be a protest against the denigration
