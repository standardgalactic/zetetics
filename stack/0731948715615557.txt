After the development of basic decoding and fluency skills, 
continued progress in reading comprehension relies on the 
ability to make inferences that connect information across 
the text and with background knowledge or that fill gaps 
that would otherwise erode the coherence of the text (Cain, 
Oakhill, Barnes, & Bryant, 2001; van den Broek, 1997). In 
fact, a study of inference making found it uniquely pre-
dicted reading comprehension in 10- and 11-year-olds even 
after controlling for verbal intelligence, vocabulary, and 
story structure knowledge (Oakhill & Cain, 2012). Given 
the need for a threshold level of basic skills and vocabulary 
knowledge, researchers generally seem to agree that infer-
ence making is best taught in the middle grades (cf., L. 
Baker, 2002). This is also a time when the passages students 
read become longer and more complex—a circumstance 
more likely to enable the formulation of inferences with 
greater specificity and wider variety (Gygax, Garnham, & 
Oakhill, 2004; van den Broek, 1997).
The increased expectation for inference making is 
reflected in the progression of text and question types on the 
National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) 
Reading Framework (National Assessment Governing 
Board & U.S. Department of Education, 2012). Across the 
tested grades 4, 8, and 12, the NAEP texts become longer, 
include more sophisticated elements of various genres, and 
are assessed with items targeting interpretation and evalua-
tion more so than recall. In addition, students are required to 
answer more short (i.e., requiring 1–2 sentences) or 
extended (i.e., requiring 1–2 paragraphs) constructed 
response items in addition to multiple-choice items. 
Unfortunately, students with reading disabilities are likely 
to struggle with inference making and, subsequently, dem-
onstrate difficulties with reading comprehension (Kendeou, 
van den Broek, Helder, & Karlsson, 2014). This is because 
inference ability is multifaceted and requires the orchestra-
tion of skills that pose problems for those with disabilities.
To infer information, the reader must possess sufficient 
background knowledge of the words and concepts in the 
text, efficiently allocate attentional resources to relevant 
information, hold information from earlier parts of the text 
in memory to be integrated with later information, and mon-
itor comprehension to detect and resolve inconsistencies as 
they arise (cf., Kendeou et al., 2014; Kispal, 2008). In addi-
tion, readers need to make local inferences within and across 
sentences of a single paragraph as well as global inferences 
across an entire text (Graesser, Singer, & Trabasso, 1994; 
Gygax et al., 2004). Research with middle-grade students

The Effects of an Inference-Making  
Strategy Taught With and Without  
Goal Setting
Deborah K. Reed, PhD1 and Devon Lynn, MS2
Abstract
This quasi-experimental study examined the effects of a strategy for making text-dependent inferences—with and without 
embedded self-regulation skills—on the reading comprehension of 24 middle-grade students with disabilities. Classes were 
randomly assigned to receive the inference intervention only (IO), inference + individual goal setting (IIG), or inference + 
group goal setting (IGG). The Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance revealed no significant differences between groups 
on overall reading comprehension performance, but students in the IGG group significantly outperformed the IO and IIG 
groups on evaluation items, χ2(2, N = 24) = 13.18, p = .001. Paired samples t tests indicated all groups significantly improved 
their comprehension performance from pre- to posttest, IO: t(8) = 2.76, p < .05; IIG: t(6) = 3.97, p < .01; IGG: t(7) = 4.35, 
p < .01. The IGG group wrote significantly more valid inferences in Lessons 3 to 7 than the IO or IIG groups; χ2(2) ranged 
from 7.26, p < .05, to 16.16, p < .001.

has identified that those with reading difficulties struggle 
even with local inferences (Barth, Barnes, Francis, Vaughn, 
& York, 2015). But as the distance between the pieces of 
information that must be related increases, students have 
exhibited still greater difficulty (Johnston, Barnes, & 
Desrochers, 2008). Although it is believed to be a malleable 
skill, more is understood about the dimensionality and con-
tributions of inference making than the strategies that might 
improve it (e.g., Cain et al., 2001; Graesser et al., 1994; 
Oakhill & Cain, 2012). As noted by Elbro and Buch-Iverson 
(2013), many intervention studies have been multicompo-
nent in nature, limiting the ability to disentangle the impact 
of inference instruction on students’ reading outcomes.
Inference-Making Interventions With 
Middle-Grade Students
A search of the extant literature revealed four intervention 
studies specific to inference making with students in the mid-
dle grades. Two of these utilized a single paragraph (Elbro & 
Buch-Iverson, 2013; Holmes, 1985), which would allow for 
making only local inferences. The other two used short pas-
sages of 100 to 400 words (Fritschmann, Deshler, & 
Schumaker, 2007) or a one-page, multiple paragraph passage 
(McMaster et al., 2012), which potentially could target both 
local and global inferences. Students in all four studies 
received prepared questions to prompt specific inferences, 
but each study exclusively used fictional narratives 
(Fritschmann et al., 2007; McMaster et al., 2012) or exposi-
tory passages (Elbro & Buch-Iverson, 2013; Holmes, 1985). 
The researchers reported positive effects for the students par-
ticipating in the interventions—including those with disabili-
ties (Fritschmann et al., 2007), in remedial reading classes 
(Holmes, 1985), in general education (Elbro & Buch-Iverson, 
2013), and at a range of ability levels (McMaster et al., 2012).
The inference-making intervention reported here dif-
fered from the previous studies in the following ways. First, 
students read both fictional and informational narrative pas-
sages that were multiple pages in length so that a number 
and variety of inferences could be made. To support con-
necting information across the text, participants were taught 
to use a graphic organizer for recording information stated 
in the text that could become the basis for an inference. This 
organizer functioned as an external memory store to over-
come the limitations of text memory noted for students with 
reading difficulties (Hua & Keenan, 2014). Students also 
could choose from a list of inference stems rather than 
receiving questions to prompt particular inferences. The 
stems allowed for local and global inferences (see the 
“Method” section). Finally, all participants received the 
inference-making instruction, but the comparison groups 
included individual or group goal setting to examine the 
potential benefits of self-regulation.
Goal Setting
Teaching students with disabilities to monitor and regulate 
their behavior has been effective at improving their access 
to general education and their post-secondary transition 
(Harris, Friedlander, Saddler, Frizzelle, & Graham, 2005; 
Shogren, Palmer, Wehmeyer, Williams-Diehm, & Little, 
2012; Test et al., 2009). A synthesis of self-regulation inter-
ventions found effects were strongest when goal setting was 
used to improve productivity and math skills (Konrad, 
Fowler, Walker, Test, & Wood, 2007). The authors argued 
for combining goal setting with direct instruction in aca-
demic skills because the self-regulation behaviors can only 
augment, not replace, what students need to know and do to 
be successful in academic courses.
This can create tension for classroom teachers who must 
balance the time needed to teach content and skills with the 
time needed to improve students’ self-regulation. In a 
national survey, middle and high school teachers responded 
that time constraints were the leading cause of omitting 
self-regulation instruction (Wehmeyer, Agran, & Hughes, 
2000). In addition, elementary and middle school teachers 
have reported not having good knowledge of how to teach 
or embed such skills within academic instruction (Stang, 
Carter, Lane, & Pierson, 2009).
Not developing self-regulation skills can have deleterious 
effects on adolescents. Such students are less likely to be 
exposed to the general education curriculum and standards 
(Shogren et al., 2012) and more likely to engage in delin-
quent behavior (Thompson, Whitmore, Raymond, & 
Crowley, 2006). In fact, as many as 90% (Drerup, Croysdale, 
& Hoffman, 2008) of juvenile offenders are believed to meet 
criteria for one or more mental health disorders that are 
linked to or further compromise the brain’s self-regulatory 
systems (Thayer, Hansen, Saus-Rose, & Johnsen, 2009).
Aspects of self-regulation, such as goal setting, were 
found to predict the long-term success of individuals with 
learning disabilities (LD; Raskind, Goldberg, Higgins, & 
Herman, 1999). Moreover, there is some evidence that 
including goal setting within literacy interventions has 
improved the performance of middle-grade students in the 
short term. For example, involving sixth- and seventh-grade 
students with LD in setting goals for their learning was asso-
ciated with stronger improvements in reading fluency as 
compared with peers who did not set goals (Swain, 2005). 
Similarly, a meta-analysis found the average weighted effect 
of goal setting in writing interventions was moderate (0.57) 
across four studies involving students in Grades 4 to 8 
(Gillespie & Graham, 2014). The authors concluded that 
“the positive impact of goal setting . . . suggests students 
with LD possess greater capabilities for carrying out writing 
processes than they apply spontaneously” (Gillespie & 
Graham, 2014, p. 469). Whether this might be true of adoles-
cents’ inference abilities while reading is not known.

Purpose and Research Questions
Previous studies have explored teaching students to make 
inferences on short paragraphs or passages and with the assis-
tance of specific questions (Elbro & Buch-Iverson, 2013; 
Fritschmann et al., 2007; Holmes, 1985; McMaster et al., 
2012), but little is known about the effectiveness of explicit 
inference instruction with longer passages and more general-
ized supports. Therefore, this study sought to contribute to the 
sparse literature on teaching adolescents with reading difficul-
ties to make inferences while reading fictional and informa-
tional narratives. The following question guided the research:
Research Question 1: To what extent does an inference-
making intervention improve the abilities of middle-
grade students with reading difficulties to infer 
information in fictional and informational narratives 
(i.e., productive tasks) and to respond correctly to literal, 
inference, and evaluation multiple-choice test questions 
(i.e., receptive tasks)?
The present work also examined the effectiveness of 
adding a self-regulation component. Previous studies of 
embedded self-regulation have overwhelmingly utilized 
single case designs and examined outcomes related to 
school and classroom behaviors with academic improve-
ment serving as a distal outcome (Konrad et al., 2007). 
Therefore, the study was designed to address the second 
research question:
Research Question 2: What are the relative effects of 
combining an inference-making intervention with individ-
ual or group goal setting on the reading comprehension 
performance—using both productive and receptive 
tasks—of middle-grade students with reading difficulties?
Method
Participants were drawn from two different schools in the 
southeastern United States that were more than 70 miles 
apart. School A was a Grade 6 to 8 public middle school, 
and School B was a juvenile correctional facility for chil-
dren between the ages of 9 and 14 (see Table 1 for partici-
pant characteristics). These sites were recruited for 
participation because they had dedicated reading or learn-
ing strategies classes as a supplement to students’ general 
education English language arts (ELA) class. Furthermore, 
juvenile offenders were included in acknowledgment that 
the students only differ by the setting in which they are 
being taught. That is, juvenile offenders move between pub-
lic and correctional schools and experience the same chal-
lenges with reading and academic achievement (Wexler, 
Reed, & Sturges, 2015).
Participants
Students from School A were all identified with a disability, 
primarily LD, and were enrolled in a learning strategies 
class taught by the same special educator. Of the 16

students, 100% agreed to participate in the study. They 
spent the remainder of their school day in general education 
classes, including a 55-min general education ELA class. In 
addition, nine students received a supplemental reading 
intervention. This was a computer-based reading practice 
program offering activities aligned to the tested state stan-
dards, but it did not deliver direct instruction in reading 
skills. Two different teachers taught the ELA classes, and 
one of those teachers facilitated the reading classes.
Students in School B were committed to the juvenile jus-
tice facility for a minimum of 6 to 9 months. Of the nine 
students in the class, eight (i.e., 89%) consented to partici-
pate. All were considered to be performing below grade 
level based on their school achievement and performance 
on reading assessments administered by the facility on 
intake, but not all were identified with a disability. It should 
be noted that under-identification of disabilities has been a 
problem among juvenile offenders due to high mobility, a 
lack of proper evaluation in the facilities, and caregivers’ 
reluctance to acknowledge the issues (Snyder & Sickmund, 
2006; Watson, Kelly, & Vidalon, 2009). Students in School 
B had a 40-min ELA class and a 45-min reading class. 
These classes met 4 days per week and were taught by the 
same teacher. The curriculum followed a state adopted text-
book series and included reading trade books.
Intervention Teachers
The distance between the schools necessitated that the sec-
ond author (a graduate assistant with 2 years’ experience 
working in special education classrooms) served as the 
interventionist in School A, and the first author delivered 
the intervention in School B. The typical classroom teach-
ers were occasionally present during the sessions but were 
not involved in delivering any instruction. In School B, two 
security guards were required to be present. They enforced 
the behavior plan when necessary but were not otherwise 
involved in the sessions.
Measures
The interventionists administered all measures during stu-
dents’ usual class time. Pre- and posttests were used to 
establish group equivalency prior to the start of the inter-
vention and to determine within-group gains and between-
group differences after the conclusion of the intervention. 
Student inferences were monitored each session. All docu-
ments were scored by two raters, one of whom was not 
involved in the intervention and was blind to condition.
Pre-/posttest of reading ability.  The easyCBM multiple-choice 
reading comprehension measure (Alonzo, Tindal, Ulmer, & 
Glasgow, 2006) was used to determine students’ overall 
reading ability as well as their disaggregated inference and 
evaluation performance. Students read one narrative easy-
CBM passage at the sixth-grade level for pretesting and a 
different one for posttesting to control for practice effects. 
The sixth-grade easyCBM was selected because 23 of the 
24 participants were in Grade 6 or higher, and the one fifth-
grade student was the same chronological age as the 
younger sixth-grade students. Each passage is followed by 
20 multiple-choice questions. Of these questions, seven are 
identified as literal, seven as inference items (also referred 
to as low-level inferences), and six as evaluation items (also 
referred to as high-level inferences). For the sixth-grade 
easyCBM measures, developers reported a Cronbach’s α 
range of .63 to .67 and split-half reliability of .47 to .52 
(Sáez et al., 2010).
Inference strategy.  Students’ work from each session was 
evaluated for the number of attempted inferences and the 
number of inferences made that were connected to informa-
tion stated in the text. For the groups with embedded goal 
setting, scores on the intervention strategy were used to 
determine whether students met their goals. Inter-rater reli-
ability among the independent scorers was 99% overall 
with a range of 97% to 100% for each of the three groups.
Intervention Materials
Although students from both schools were expected to 
make inferences to complete assignments in their ELA and 
reading courses, the teachers reported they did not teach a 
specific strategy for doing so. This was confirmed by 
reviewing the curricular materials used for typical practice 
as well as observing each ELA class twice and each reading 
class once. Three fictional narratives and three informa-
tional narratives, each 3 to 5 pages in length, were selected 
from a sixth-grade anthology. The research team read the 
selections and generated sample inferences to ensure a min-
imum of five inferences could be made per passage.
From the sample inferences and the extant literature 
(e.g., Fritschmann et al., 2007), researchers created a list of 
12 stems that students could use to support their work such 
as, I think the reason _____ happened was because _____. 
In addition, a graphic organizer (Elbro & Buch-Iverson, 
2013; McMackin & Witherell, 2005) was adapted to pro-
vide a structured means for students to record stated infor-
mation from the passage and the inferences they generated 
from that information (see Figure 1). The stems and graphic 
organizer were used as scaffolds for the students with learn-
ing difficulties, who are known to struggle with written 
tasks (S. K. Baker, Chard, Ketterlin-Geller, Apichatabutra, 
& Doabler, 2009).
To facilitate goal setting in two of the three intervention 
groups, the researchers created a form (see Figure 2) for 
students to identify the number of inferences they wanted to 
make per passage and three steps they could take to

accomplish that goal. The form also included a graph tem-
plate for students to chart their progress in each session.
Procedure
The two learning strategies classes at School A and the one 
class of students at School B were randomly assigned to the 
three treatment conditions: inference instruction only (IO), 
inference + individual goal setting (IIG), and inference + 
group goal setting (IGG). Although random assignment of 
classes is a less rigorous research design than random 
assignment 
of 
individual 
students 
(What 
Works 
Clearinghouse, 2014), cluster-randomized designs can be 
considered necessary (a) to minimize contamination 
between treatments within the same classroom or (b) when 
the treatment is intended at the level of the cluster (Hedges 
& Rhoads, 2009). Both scenarios were present in this study: 
It was necessary to (a) minimize contamination among stu-
dents assigned to IO or IIG and (b) implement IGG with one 
intact class.
Inference only (IO).  In the first of the seven sessions, the 
interventionists started by building students’ background 
knowledge of what an inference was. They defined infer-
ence (i.e., using stated information to figure out a piece of 
information that was not directly stated) and then wrote four 
sentences on the board to demonstrate making inferences 
and to practice doing so with the students. For the example 
sentence, “Harold dribbled down the court and passed the 
ball to Anne,” the interventionists explained that the infor-
mation about dribbling, being on a court, and passing a ball 
could be used to infer that Harold and Anne were playing 
basketball.
Next, the interventionists distributed the graphic orga-
nizer and explained how it would be used to record infor-
mation stated in a passage (e.g., dribbling and passing a 
ball) in the things you know for sure box and information 
that could be inferred (e.g., playing basketball) in the things 
you infer or figure out box. They then distributed a passage 
and provided a brief introduction to the fictional story and 
three key words. The interventionists read the passage aloud

to students while stopping periodically to model completing 
the graphic organizer. The interventionists performed a 
think aloud, verbalizing why they recorded some interest-
ing information that connected to one or more pieces of 
information stated earlier in the text or that seemed to sug-
gest something else that was not directly stated by the 
author. The interventionists also explained how they might 
use a sentence stem from the list to help compose an

inference if they were not sure how to express it. Using the 
stems was encouraged but not required.
In Session 2, the interventionists reviewed with the 
students what an inference was, how inferences were 
made from stated information, how both the stated and 
inferred information were recorded on the graphic orga-
nizer, and how to use the list of stems when necessary. 
They then distributed a new passage and blank graphic 
organizer before providing an introduction to the topic 
and time period of the informational narrative as well as 
the key words. The interventionists and the students alter-
nated reading the passage aloud so that the class could 
stop together to record information on the graphic orga-
nizers and generate inferences.
After introducing the passage (alternating fictional and 
informational narratives) and about three key words, the 
interventionists also conducted Session 3 in a whole-group 
fashion. However, students now were asked to generate their 
inferences independently whenever the class stopped to 
record information on their graphic organizers. Although the 
interventionists always introduced the passage and key 
words, students gradually assumed greater responsibility for 
making inferences. In Sessions 4 and 5, students worked in 
pairs to complete the graphic organizers, and they worked 
independently in the final Sessions 6 and 7. Students always 
received a new graphic organizer and had access to the list of 
inference stems. In addition, they received feedback on their 
performance each session so that they knew when they were 
making valid inferences (i.e., inferences connected to infor-
mation stated in the text).
Inference + individual goal setting (IIG).  Instruction began 
and proceeded in the same fashion as described for the 
IO group. The only difference was that, starting in Ses-
sion 2, students in the IIG group were asked to set a goal 
for the number of inferences they thought they could 
make by considering how well they understood and con-
tributed to the process of making inferences from the 
previous session. Each student recorded that number as 
his or her individual goal on the goal setting form and 
then worked with the interventionist to develop three 
steps for reaching that goal. For example, a student might 
use the stems, confer with a partner, and reread the pas-
sage. After receiving their graded organizers each ses-
sion, students recorded the number of their correct 
inferences on the graph. A student who met his or her 
goal for two consecutive sessions then increased the 
goal. A student who did not meet his or her goal for two 
consecutive sessions worked with the interventionist 
either to revise the steps to take or decrease the goal.
Inference + group goal setting (IGG).  As with the IIG group, 
instruction in the IGG group began and proceeded in the 
same fashion as described for the IO group. The only 
difference was that, in Session 2, the IGG group collectively 
set a goal for how many inferences they thought they could 
make. All students had to agree to the same goal. That same 
number was recorded on everyone’s goal setting form, and 
the class then worked with the interventionist to develop 
three steps for how they could reach the goal. After receiving 
their graded graphic organizers each session, students 
recorded their own number of correct inferences on the 
graph. If all students in the class met the group goal for two 
consecutive sessions, they collectively increased the goal. If 
everyone did not meet the group goal for two consecutive 
sessions, they worked with the interventionist either to revise 
their steps or goal.
Dosage and duration.  Across groups, intervention sessions 
were provided 1 to 2 times per week based on other school 
or facility scheduling demands. The seven sessions spanned 
7 weeks in Building A (groups IO and IIG) and 5 weeks in 
Building B (group IGG). The review of inference instruc-
tion in Sessions 2 through 7 lasted 3 to 5 min, and the text 
reading with periodic inference making required 30 to 40 
min of class time. In the IIG and IGG groups, the review of 
goals lasted an average 2 min per session.
Fidelity of Implementation
All sessions across groups were audio recorded, and the 
recordings subsequently were coded by two separate raters, 
neither of whom was involved in delivering the instruction. 
Poor quality audio resulted in the loss of one session from 
each of the IO and IIG groups (14% of the fidelity data from 
those groups), so a total of 19 sessions (90% of all fidelity 
data) were coded for fidelity to treatment protocols. Raters 
disagreed on only one code, resulting in 99% inter-rater 
reliability. Using the more conservative rating, overall fidel-
ity was 99% with a range of 96% in the IIG group to 100% 
in the IO and IGG groups.
Results
Descriptive data for all dependent variables are provided 
in Table 2. Given the small sample, different group sizes, 
and use of clustered-randomized assignment, the non-
parametric Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance 
was used to evaluate whether the pre- and posttest data 
differed significantly among the IO, IIG, and IGG groups 
(Kruskal & Wallis, 1952). The Kruskal–Wallis H test is 
similar to a Mann–Whitney U test but allows for the 
comparison of more than two groups. Results of the pre-
test analysis indicated there were no statistically signifi-
cant differences between groups on the total easyCBM 
score or the inference and evaluation easyCBM items 
specifically (see Table 3 for mean ranks and Chi-square 
values).

Productive Tasks
There were no statistically significant differences among 
the treatment groups on the number of attempted or valid 
inferences in Session 2. This was the first time students 
were involved in making inferences, but the interventionists 
led this as a whole-group lesson and had not yet introduced 
goal setting to the IIG or IGG groups. When students were 
more self-directed in making inferences during Sessions 3 
through 7, the IGG group significantly outperformed both 
the IO and IIG groups on the number of inferences 
attempted, χ2(2) ranged from 11.06, p = .004, to 15.53, p < 
.001 and the number of those attempts that were accurately 
linked to information stated directly in the text; χ2(2) ranged 
from 7.26, p = .03, to 16.16, p < .001. A Benjamini–
Hochberg correction (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995) was 
applied to control for the false discovery rate in multiple 
hypothesis testing. The resulting q value was .023, confirm-
ing the results were significant.
Students in the IO group made mostly steady improve-
ments in the number of valid inferences they could make on 
a passage, regardless of whether it was a fictional or infor-
mational narrative or whether they were working with peers 
or individually. They progressed from an average 2.14 
inferences in Session 2 to 4.25 inferences in Session 7, with 
only one small decline from Session 4 (average 3.50 infer-
ences) to Session 5 (average 3.44 inferences). The IIG 
group had more variable performance with two periods of 
decline (from Sessions 2–3 and 5–6), which coincided with 
the transitions from teacher-directed to partner work and 
from partner work to completely independent work. The 
IGG group demonstrated a large increase in the number of 
valid inferences made once goal setting began (average 
2.57 inferences in Session 2 to 10.29 inferences in Session 
3). The latter was the highest number of valid inferences 
made in any session. Thereafter, performance fluctuated 
with the lowest average of 6.75 inferences in Session 6 and 
a final average of 8.00 inferences in Session 7.
Receptive Tasks
The significantly better performance of the IGG group was 
maintained in the posttest only on the evaluation (or high-
level inference) items of the easyCBM, χ2(2) = 13.18, p = 
.001. Again, the Benjamini–Hochberg correction confirmed 
the significant finding, q = .023. The overall easyCBM 
score as well as the scores on the literal and inference items 
specifically were not significantly different across groups. 
However, the standard deviations suggest there was less 
variability in the performance of the IGG students.
Despite the lack of significant differences in their overall 
posttest scores, it was apparent that all groups improved. Paired 
samples t tests confirmed the within-group gains on the overall 
comprehension score were significant, IO: t(8) = 2.76,

Goal Attainment
Data on the number of students in the IIG and IGG groups 
who met their goal for each of the Sessions 3 through 7 (the 
lessons which incorporated goal setting and required stu-
dents to be more self-directed in making inferences) were 
analyzed descriptively. Means are presented in Table 4. The 
IGG group had a higher proportion of students meeting the 
group goal in each session (75%–100%) than the proportion 
of students in the IIG group meeting their individual goals 
(0%–57%).
Discussion
Because reading achievement in the middle grades and 
beyond hinges on students’ ability to glean more than a sur-
face-level understanding of the text (Cain et al., 2001; van 
den Broek, 1997), the study reported here implemented an 
inference-making intervention that incorporated a number of 
important features. To facilitate writing a greater number 
and variety of inferences (Gygax et al., 2004; van den Broek, 
1997), students read longer fictional and informational nar-
rative passages from a typical sixth-grade anthology. 
Interventionists built or activated background knowledge by 
introducing the passage and key words before students 
began reading (Cain et al., 2001). In addition, students used 
a graphic organizer as an external memory store to

overcome reported difficulties with integrating information 
from across the passage (Barth et al., 2015; Hua & Keenan, 
2014), and students had access to inference stems as a sup-
port for making inferences without prompting.
Improvements in Productive and Receptive 
Inference-Making Tasks
In answer to the first research question, findings revealed 
that middle-grade students with LD who received explicit 
instruction significantly improved their pre- to posttest per-
formance on a multiple-choice test of reading comprehen-
sion. This extends the positive findings of previous studies 
(Elbro & Buch-Iverson, 2013; Fritschmann et al., 2007; 
Holmes, 1985; McMaster et al., 2012), which used ques-
tions to prompt particular inferences with shorter passages 
of a single type (either narrative or informational). The 
gains demonstrated by participating students were attribut-
able to their significant improvement on non-literal items: 
the inference items for the IO and IIG groups or the evalua-
tion (high-level inference) items for the IGG group. 
Students’ improvement also might be described as practi-
cally significant because their overall performance would 
have been considered a failing grade (M = 57% correct 
responses) at pretest but a passing grade (M = 71% correct) 
at posttest just 5 to 7 weeks later.
The test passages were different at each testing point, 
and neither passage was used in the intervention sessions. 
Therefore, students’ performance is interpreted as an indi-
cator of their ability to generalize the knowledge of infer-
ence making to a new context for which they did not receive 
any of the instructional components described above (i.e., 
building background knowledge, using a graphic organizer, 
or having the freedom to make unprompted inferences). 
The multiple-choice items were a receptive task as opposed 
to the productive act of making inferences without a spe-
cific prompt. Across the seven sessions, performance on the 
production of inferences was variable with the pattern of 
performance seemingly related to treatment group, which 
partly answers the second research question.
Effects of Embedded Goal Setting
Students in the IO group, who were not asked to set goals, 
demonstrated steady improvement in the number of infer-
ences they attempted and the valid number of inferences 
made. This seemed immune to passage type (fictional or 
informational narrative) and stage of explicit instruction 
(teacher-led, partner work, or independent). Embedding 
individual goal setting did not make a significant difference 
in the number of inferences attempted or made by the IIG 
group, but it did increase the variability of their attempts 
and valid inferences. Declines in the valid number of infer-
ences made coincided with instructional stage changes, 
suggesting students initially had some difficulty achieving 
their goals whenever the amount of support decreased. This 
was not the case for the students in the IGG group. Once 
they set their first group goal, the IGG students began 
attempting to make significantly more inferences than the 
IO or IIG groups and had significantly more valid infer-
ences than the other groups. Although the IGG group’s per-
formance was variable, it was not related to instructional 
stage change.
Anecdotally, interventionists noticed that students in the 
IIG group tended to set goals at the extreme high and low 
values. That is, they either wanted to establish a low bar to 
ensure they could meet it, or they wanted to set an unrealisti-
cally high bar as though in competition with their peers. This 
difficulty with goal setting among students with LD has been 
noted by others (Graham & Harris, 1989; Swain, 2005). In 
the present study, setting the goal as a group seemed to bal-
ance out the over- and under-ambitiousness of students 
because they had to negotiate what everyone was willing and 
able to do. Those who had that sense of competitiveness 
applied it to attempting inferences above the number of the 
group goal. This was an unintended but beneficial strategy 
for those students. Making more inferences increased the 
likelihood they would have some correct and would meet or 
exceed the goal. Those who only tried to make the minimum 
number of inferences established by the group goal would 
fail to meet it if any of the inferences were deemed invalid 
(i.e., not connected to information from the text). Because the 
entire group had to meet the goal to advance to a new goal, 
students felt some accountability for altering the steps they 
would take (see goal setting form in Figure 2) by attempting 
to write more inferences. This is reflected in the higher pro-
portion of IGG students meeting the goal each session as 
compared with the IIG group.
The increased practice the students in the IGG group 
imposed on themselves could have contributed to their sig-
nificantly better performance on the evaluation items post-
test. However, the three treatment groups did not 
significantly differ in their overall posttest or their inference 
item performance.
Limitations
This study was conducted in unique settings (self-contained 
learning strategies classes and a juvenile justice facility), 
which limited the sample size in each treatment group. In 
addition, the requirements for the goal setting necessitated 
using a cluster-randomized design (Hedges & Rhoads, 
2009). These circumstances present the possibility that the 
findings are due to particular characteristics present in this 
sample and, potentially, not true of or generalizable to the 
larger population of middle-grade students with reading dif-
ficulties. Furthermore, the authors acknowledge there were 
fewer students with identified disabilities in the IGG group

in School B (the juvenile justice facility) as compared with 
the IO and IIG groups in School A (the public middle 
school). Juvenile offenders often are under-identified with 
disabilities (Snyder & Sickmund, 2006; Watson et al., 
2009), but it is possible any differences in performance 
were due to the higher rate of LD within the IO and IIG 
groups rather than the effects of the goal setting conditions. 
However, there were no significant differences found at 
pretest or on the first teacher-guided, whole-group lesson 
(Session 2). The IGG group’s significantly higher number 
of attempts and valid inferences were not realized until goal 
setting initiated in Session 3.
Given that the groups were taught by different interven-
tionists, it is not possible to rule out teacher effects. Fidelity 
in all conditions was consistently high (96%–100%), thus 
increasing confidence that instruction was equivalent across 
groups and sessions. Moreover, an independent rater, who 
was bind to condition, verified the scoring of all dependent 
measures with consistently high inter-rater reliability 
(97%–100%).
Some variability in student performance across sessions 
or from pre- to posttest could be attributable to passage 
effects. Although future studies might attempt to use equated 
passages, the preference in the present study was to evaluate 
student performance with ecologically valid materials and 
measures (Bronfenbrenner, 1993). Passages were drawn 
from a typical school anthology, and the test administered 
was not unlike the kind a typical classroom teacher might 
give. With respect to the latter, the pre- and posttest included 
only one passage each and had few items per type (literal = 7, 
inference = 7, evaluation = 6). The reported Cronbach’s α 
range of .63 to .67 (Sáez et al., 2010) for all 20 items is 
slightly below the liberal minimum of .70 (Nunnally, 1978) 
but likely would be even lower for the smaller number of 
disaggregated item types. Hence, the significant finding for 
the evaluation items needs to be interpreted with caution.
Instructional Implications and Directions for 
Future Research
The participating middle-grade students with reading diffi-
culties learned to make inferences from text-based informa-
tion with relatively little instruction. Instruction progressed 
from modeling, to guided practice, to independent practice 
in seven sessions lasting 45 to 50 min each. This is similar 
to the time required for two previously studied interven-
tions (Elbro & Buch-Iverson, 2013; Fritschmann et al., 
2007) and less than that for the McMaster et al. (2012) 
intervention. In contrast to the extant research, students in 
this study read longer texts and were not reliant on teacher-
prepared questions to narrow their inferences. Rather, they 
were able to write their own inferences, using only a generic 
graphic organizer and a list of suggested sentence stems. 
Hence, it is believed the inference intervention implemented 
could be a feasible practice for classroom teachers. Future 
research should explore its effectiveness in general educa-
tion classes. Ideally, these studies would be planned for lon-
ger durations and include comparison groups not receiving 
the intervention as well as standardized measures of student 
performance and growth.
For two of the treatment groups, goal setting was embed-
ded within the inference intervention. Classroom teachers 
have expressed concern that they lack the time or knowl-
edge to address self-regulation skills (Stang et al., 2009; 
Wehmeyer et al., 2000), but the simple approach reported 
here took a minimal amount of time each session—about 2 
min. Students in the IIG group did not set very appropriate 
goals when asked to do so individually, and the goal setting 
did not contribute to significantly better performance. In 
fact, the IO group without any goal setting was making 
more steady progress that might, over an extended period of 
time, have demonstrated an advantage over the IIG group. 
If that hypothesis is borne out in future research, it would 
render the 2 min per day devoted to individual goal setting 
an unnecessary loss of instructional time that could add up 
to several hours over the course of a semester or year.
However, the group goal setting seemed to be more ben-
eficial for encouraging practice and self-reflection on stu-
dents’ efforts and progress, which has been shown to 
improve self-efficacy in reading and writing (Schunk, 
2003). This warrants further study for its potential relation-
ship to distal student outcomes such as overall achievement 
and educational attainment. As Schunk (2003) stated, 
“People do not attempt to attain what they believe is impos-
sible” (p. 164). For middle-grade students who have experi-
enced repeated and increasing difficulty with the 
inference-making expectations of course work and account-
ability tests, it may be motivating to learn an intervention 
that is transferable to different texts and with which they are 
able to make noticeable progress.
