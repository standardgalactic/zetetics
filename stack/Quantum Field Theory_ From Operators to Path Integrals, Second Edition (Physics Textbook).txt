Preface 
Quantum field theory, one could say, is an all-encompassing framework of the-
oretical physics. The laws of nature, as we know them, are best formulated and 
explored in this language. Its applications include the fundamental interactions of 
elementary particles, as well as the statistical behavior of condensed matter. 
This book introduces the subject to an advanced audience in theoretical physics, 
on the level of a graduate textbook. We assume that the reader is conversant with 
quantum mechanics at the level of a graduate course. 
The field concept is indispensable in the classical theory of electromagnetism. 
The quantal version arises as soon as Planck introduces the quantum in black-
body radiation, whose modes are described in terms of the quantum harmonic 
oscillator. As every student of quantum mechanics knows, there arise a and  at,  the 
creation and annihilation operators of photons, which must appear to be stunning-
ly empowering concepts at first encounter. However, they occur in the combination 
at a ± a at . That is, you create a photon and immediately destroy it, or vice versa; 
and that doesn't sound like serious business. It's when you operate a and at sepa-
rately, in the act of destroying or creating a single photon, as in Einstein's theory of 
the photo-electric effect, that the quantum field really flies. 
Thus, the first quantum field theory is QED (quantum electrodynamics). Af-
ter decades of development, culminating in Feynman's graphical techniques and 
Dyson's renormalization theory, QED has become the most accurately verified the-
ory we have, to the tune of one part in a trillion, in its calculation of the magnetic 
moment of the electron. A detailed exposition of this theory forms an important 
part of this book. 
Feynman's whimsical "space-time approach" to quantum-mechanical transitions 
not only gives us the Feynman graph that proves to be such a powerful computa-
tional tool, but, perhaps more profoundly, his path integral — a "sum over histories", 
as he calls it. This method reformulates quantum mechanics without operators, 
extends it in ways heretofore unimaginable, and bridges quantum field theory and 
statistical mechanics. The second part of this book goes into the subject in some 
detail. 
A far-reaching development arising from the bridge to statistical mechanics is 
Wilson's formulation of renormalization. The Wilson scheme transforms what ap-
pears to be a mathematical trick in QED to something with physical content, and 
Quantum Field Theory from Operators to Path Integrals. K. Huang

XIV Preface 
shows us how a theory navigates the space of all possible Lagrangians, under scale 
transformations. It suggests that all theories designed by us are "phenomenologi-
cal", in that they can only be approximations to some "true" theory, in the neigh-
borhood of a particular fixed point of the group of scale transformations. The wider 
implications of renormalization remains to be explored. In this connection, we de-
scribe the terrain of theory space near the Gaussian fixed point, and introduce a 
more general formulation due to Polchinski. 
The connection between quantum field theory and statistical mechanics rests on 
the apparent accident that the operator of time translation in quantum mechanics, 
exp (— i t Hlh), where H is the Hamiltonian, maps into the density operator of the 
canonical ensemble exp (—PH), where 13 is the inverse temperature, if one makes 
the substitution t —ihfi. That is, time corresponds to a pure-imaginary inverse 
temperature. The reason for this coincidence remains unknown. This mystery, and 
the deeper meaning of renormalization, are left for the reader's contemplation. 
One important subject omitted from this book is the Yang-Mills gauge theory that 
underlies the standard model of particle theory. This subject has been covered in 
the author's Quarks, Leptons, and Gauge Fields, 2nd ed. (World Scientific Publishers, 
Singapore, 1992), which, although predating this book, may be considered a sequel. 
The material in this book are gathered over the years in courses I have taught 
at MIT, and I have learned much from my colleagues, past and present. They in-
clude the late Herman Feshbach, Kenneth Johnson, and Francis Low, and present 
associates Jeffrey Goldstone, Roman Jackiw and Patrick Lee.

Introducing Quantum Fields 
1.1 
The Classical String 
We obtain a quantum field by quantizing a classical field, of which the simplest 
example is the classical string. To be on firm mathematical grounds, we define 
the latter as the long-wavelength limit of a discrete chain. Consider N ± 2 masses 
described by the classical Lagrangian 
N+1 
L(q, = 	
—q • — —(q —q 
+02 
_2 	
2 
j  
j=0 
where m is the mass, and K a force constant. The coordinate (41 (t) represents the 
lateral displacement of the j-th mass along a one-dimensional chain. We impose 
fixed-endpoint boundary conditions, by setting 
go(t)= qN-Fi(t) =  0 	
(1.2) 
The equations of motion for the N remaining movable masses are then 
mq j  K (qj 	
— 	 + 	
= 0 
(j 	N) 	
(1.3) 
The normal modes have the form 
q1 (t) = cos(w t) sin( jp) 	
(1.4) 
To satisfy the boundary conditions, choose p to have one of the N possible values 
grn 
P 	
(n 	
1, ... N) 
N+1  
(1.5) 
Substituting this into the equations of motion, we obtain N independent normal 
frequencies co :

where 
(Do = 
(1.7) 
This is a cutoff frequency, for the modes with n > N merely repeat the lower ones. 
For N = 4, for example, the independent modes correspond to n = 1, 2, 3, 4. The 
case n = 5 is trivial, being equivalent to n = 0. The case n = 6 is the same as that 
for n = 4, since w 6  = w4, and sin( j p6) -= — sin( j 194). 
When N is large, and we are not interested in the behavior near the endpoints, it 
is convenient to use periodic boundary conditions 
qi+N(t) = q1 (t) 	
(1.8) 
In this case the normal modes are 
q1 (t) = 	
P —w t) 	
(1.9) 
For N even, the boundary conditions can be satisfied by putting 
2grn 
Pn = 	
 
(n = 0, +1, 	
N/2) 	
(1.10) 
The corresponding normal frequencies are 
w =  
prrt 
N 
Compared to the fixed-end case, the spacing between normal frequencies is now 
doubled; but each frequency is twofold degenerate, and the number of normal 
modes remains the same. A comparison of the two cases for N = 8 is shown 
in Figure 1.1. 
The equilibrium distance a between masses does not explicitly appear in the 
Lagrangian; it merely supplies a length scale for physical distances. For example, it 
appears in the definition of the distance of a mass from an end of the chain:

Figure 1.2 Normal modes of a discrete chain of 4 masses, compared with those of a con-
tinuous string. The former repeat themselves after the first 4 modes. (After J. C. Slater and 
N. H. Frank, Mechanics, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1947). 
For fixed-end boundary conditions 
q(0, t) = q(R, t) = 0 
the normal modes of the continuous string are 
q n (x, t) = cos(w n t)sin(k nx) 
with co, = ck n , and 
on/ 
k n  = 	
(n = 0, 1, 2, • • • ) 
The normal frequencies w n  are the same as those for the discrete chain for n/N .<< 
1, as given in (1.6). However, the number of modes of the continuum string is 
infinite, and only the first N modes have correspondence with those of the discrete 
string. This is illustrated in Figure 1.2 for N = 4. Thus, there is a cutoff frequency

We obtain the cutoff frequency co, by setting n = N/2. 

1.3 The Quantum String 
1.2 
Renormalization 
The high-frequency cutoff is a theoretical necessity. Without it, the specific heat 
of the string will diverge, since each normal mode contributes an amount k  T.  
The value of the cutoff cannot be determined from the long-wavelength effective 
theory, because only the combination c = aco cpr occurs. Absorbing the cutoff into 
measurable parameters, as done in (1.17), is called renorrnalization. A theory for 
which this can be done is said to be renorrnalizable. 
Non-renormalizable systems exhibit behavior that is sensitive to atomic motion. 
Such behavior would appear to be random on a macroscopic scale, as in the prop-
agation of cracks in materials, and the nucleation of raindrops. 
1.3

limit. The Hamiltonian of the classical discrete chain is given by

commutation relation 
[p  (x,  t), q(x' , t)] = 	x') 	
(1.38) 
Just as in the classical case, we have to introduce a cutoff frequency co,. General 
properties of the quantum field will be discussed more fully in Chapter 2. 
1.4 
Second Quantization 
Another way to obtain a quantum field is to consider a collection of identical par-
ticles in quantum mechanics. In this case, the quantum field is an equivalent de-
scription of the system. Identical particles are defined by a Hamiltonian that is (a) 
invariant under a permutation of the particle coordinates, and (b) has the same 
form for any number of particles. The quantized-field description is called "sec-
ond quantization" for historical reasons, but quantization was actually done only 
once. 

1.4 Second Quantization 
Let 7i N  the Hilbert space of a system of N identical non-relativistic particles. The 
union of all NN is called the Fock space: 
00 
= (_j 	
(1.39) 
N=0 
The subspace with N = 0 contains the vacuum state as its only member. We as-
sume that N is the eigenvalues of a "number operator" Nop, which commutes with 
the Hamiltonian. It is natural to introduce operators on Fock space that connect 
subspaces of different N. An elementary operator of this kind creates or annihi-
lates one particle at a point in space. Such an operator is a quantum field operator, 
since it is a spatial function. This is why a quantum-mechanical many-particle sys-
tem automatically gives rise to a quantum field. 
For definiteness, consider N non-relativistic particles in 3 spatial dimensions, 
with coordinates Ir l , 	
, r N  1. The Hamiltonian is 
+ V(ri, 	
, rN) 	
(1.40) 
where V is the Laplacian with respect to ri, and where  Vis a symmetric function 
of its arguments. The eigenfunctions V', are defined by 
H Wn (ri , 	
,r N) = En 111,(ri, 	
rN) 	
(1.41) 
For Bose or Fermi statistics, Wn  is respectively symmetric or antisymmetric under 
an interchange of any two coordinates r i  and  r1 .  The particles are called bosons or 
fermions respectively. 
We now describe the equivalent quantum field theory, and justify it later. Let tp (r) 
be the Schrbdinger-picture operator that annihilates one particle at r. Its hermitian 
conjugate /pi-  (r) will create one particle at r. They are defined through the commu-
tation relations 
[Ip (r), 	
(I')] +  = 6 3  
[7,i) (r), (01 ±  =0 	
(1.42) 
where [A, .13]+ =  AB  ±  BA, with the plus sign corresponding to bosons and the 
minus sign to fermions. The Fock- space Hamiltonian will be defined in such a 
manner that it reduces to (1.40) in the N-particle subspace. 
A general N-particle Hamiltonian has the structure 
H = 
f(ri) 
g(ri,ri ) + 	
h(ri,ri,rk) + • • 	
(1.43) 
i< j<k 
where the functions g, h, etc. are symmetric functions of their arguments. The first 
term is a "one-particle operator", a sum of operators of the form f(r), which act on 
one particle only. The second term is a "two-particle operator", a sum of operators 

8 f 
1 Introducing Quantum Fields 
of the form g(ri  , r2 ), over all distinct pairs. Generally, an "n-particle operator" is 
a sum of operators that depend only on a set of n coordinates. To construct the 
Hamiltonian on Fock space, we associate an n-particle operator with an operator 
on Fock space, with the following correspondences: 
f(ri) —> f d 3  ript (r) f(r)v) (r)

V2111) 31h 123 7P3 1P2 1P1 
(1.44) 
where for brevity we have written v i 	
(ri ), g12 =-- g(ri, r2), etc. 
As an example, suppose the potential in (1.40) is a sum of two-body potentials: 
V(ri , 	
, rN) = 	
v(ri, ri) 	
(1.45) 
i<j 
Then the corresponding Fockspace Hamiltonian, also denoted H, takes the form 
H =_ — —
1  f d 3  rlp (r)V2 V(r) 
2m 
+  i f  d 3  c/ 3  r2 V
1 (ri )lp I (r2)v(r i , r2)/p(r2)1p(ri ) 
The particle number is the eigenvalue of the number operator, defined as 
Nop  =f d3  rtp (r)V(r) 
By using (1.42), we can verify the relations 
[Nop , H] = 0 
[V) (r), Nod = (r) 
Pp I (r), Nop] 	
_
t (r) 
These imply that the action of  p (r) on a eigenstate of Nop  is to decrease its eigen-
value by 1, while that of lp t (r) is to increase it by 1. Thus 
(r) is an annihilation 
operator, while zp (r) is a creation operator. The vacuum state 10) is defined as the 
eigenstate of Nop  with eigenvalue zero. It is annihilated by all annihilation opera-
tors: 
(010) = 0 	
(1.49) 
By applying ?pt (r) to the vacuum state repeatedly, it is easy to show that the eigen-
values of Nop  are nonnegative integers. 
(1.46) 
(1.47) 
(1.48) 

1.5 Creation and Annihilation Operators 
To demonstrate that the quantum field is equivalent to the many-particle system, 
consider a complete set of states I E, N) of the quantum field, which are simultane-
ous eigenstate of Hand Nop : 
HIE, N) = E, N) 
Nop l E, N) = NI E, N) 
We define the N-particle wave function 'PE  (ri, 	
, r N ) corresponding to I E, N) by 
1 
WE(ri, • • • , rN) = 	
N! (017P(ri) • • • lp(r N )I E, N) 	
(1.50) 
which the correct symmetry with respect to particle permutation. It tell us that the 
probability amplitude for finding N particle at the positions r1, , r N  can be found 
by annihilating the particles at the respective locations from the state I E, N), and 
evaluating the overlap between the resulting state and the vacuum state. We leave 
it as an exercise to show that this wave function satisfies the N-particle Schriidinger 
equation (1.41). (See Problem 1.3.) 
1.5 
Creation and Annihilation Operators 
The field operator lp (r) annihilates a particle at r. That is, it annihilates a particle 
whose wave function is a 6-function. Since the latter can be written as a linear 
superposition of a complete set of wave functions, we can express ?p (r) as a linear 
superposition of operators that annihilate particles with specific types of wave func-
tions. Suppose u k (r) is a member of a complete orthonormal set of single-particle 
wave functions: 
f
cl 3 ru *k  (r)uk/(r) = 
k k' 
u(r)u * (ri) = 6 3 (r — 
An example of such a set is plane-waves: 
uk(r) 	
1 	
 ik.r 	
(1.51) 
We can expand the field operators with respect to such a basis: 
(r) — 	
uk(r)ak 
(r) = 	
u (r)a lk  
The coefficient ak and a are operators that satisfy the commutation relations 
ak, akl ±  = 5 kki 
ak, ak ,]+ = 0 	
(1.52) 

1 Introducing Quantum Fields 
where the + sign is for bosons, and the — sign for fermions. These relations follow 
from (1.42) and the orthonormality of the functions uk (r). 
It follows from the commutation relations that, for each k, the eigenvalues of 
ak  are integers nk, called the occupation number of the single-particle state k: 
aTa1n) = nin) 
(n1m) 	
(1.53) 
where we have omitted the label k for brevity. The allowed values of the occupation 
number are given by 
n = 0, 1, 2,

(Bose statistics) 
0, 1 	(Fermi statistics) 
The actions of a and  aT  have the following results: 
am)  = N/TtIn — 1) 
atm)  = ,V1+ n1n +1) 	
(1.54) 
where the ± sign corresponds respectively to Bose (+) and Fermi (—) statistics. 
which show that a annihilates a particle in the state with wave function u(r), and 
at creates such a particle. We leave it as an exercise to derive these basic results. 
(See Problem 1.2.) 
The state 10) corresponding to n = 0 is the vacuum state, which satisfies 
al0) -= 0 	
(1.55) 
We assume that it is normalizable: 
(010) = 1 	
(1.56) 
Obviously all other states can be obtained by creating particles from the vacuum: 
In) = 	
1 (at)n  In) 	
(1.57) 
We can simultaneously diagonalize ak t ak  for all k. The eigenstates are then la-
beled by a set of occupation numbers {no , n 1 , ...}, and they constitute a basis for 
the Fock space. The total number of particles present is N =- Ek  nk. We have

A complete set of states can be constructed by creating particles from the vacu-

These states are not normalized to unity. When there are many particle present, it 
is more convenient to label the state with occupation numbers {n k  }, where n k  is 
the number of particles with single-particle quantum number k: 
=  cl  .i[aktink JO)

These states can be normalized to unity by choosing

1.6 
Bose and Fermi Statistics 
The term "statistics" refers to the rule for counting the degeneracy of an energy lev-
el of a many-particle system. In 3 dimensional space, it depends on the symmetry 
of the wave function under a permutation of the particle coordinates. Technically 
speaking, the different possible symmetries correspond to the different irreducible 
representations of the permutation group. 
The completely symmetric and the completely antisymmetric representations 
correspond respectively to Bose and Fermi statistics. They are the only possible 
ones in a two-particle system; but for more than two particles other possibilities ex-
ist, in which the wave function is symmetric with respect to permutations among 
one subset S of coordinates, and antisymmetric for the complementary set. Called 
"parastatistics", such representations correspond to the Young's tableaux with more 
than one row, or more than one column. Since the particle are identical, there is 
more than one way to choose the subset S. Consequently, such "para" representa-
tions must be multidimensional. That is, the carrier space for such a representation 
must be spanned by states having the same energy eigenvalue, and they mix under 
a permutation of the coordinates. Therefore, the energy levels of particles obeying 
parastatistics must have intrinsic degeneracies, which cannot be removed by any 
interaction that treat the particles as identical. 
The Bose and Fermi statistics can be set apart from the parastatistics by virtue of 
the following properties: 

1 Introducing Quantum Fields 
•
Under particle permutation, the symmetry character of wave functions is inde-
pendent of the number of particles present. 
•
Energy eigenfunctions do not mix under particle permutation. 
Parastatistics does occur in atomic physics, but only in the context of "incomplete" 
permutations, which interchange the positions of atomic electrons but not their 
spins. With respect to permutations of both position and spin, electrons obey Fermi 
statistics, as we know. No known examples of parastatistics have been found in 
nature. Perhaps the simple properties itemized above are essential for consistency 
on some level. 
Although we live in a 3D world, some interesting physical systems are effective-
ly 2D. These include the electron sheets that exhibit the quantum Hall effect, the 
copper-oxide planes in a high-temperature superconductor, and thin films of su-
perfluid helium on various substrates. In a 2D system, the variety of statistics is 
far richer, because the exchange of two particle in a plane is not a unique process: 
we may rotate the particles about a center through angle nyr, where n is any odd 
integer, and the paths corresponding to different n are not necessarily equivalent. 
Consequently, the symmetry group relevant to particle exchange is not the permu-
tation group, but the much larger braid group. This circumstance allows for frac-
tional spin and statistics; but we shall not discuss this, except for a brief discussion 
on fractional spin in Chapter 19.

Scalar Fields

Klein—Gordon Equation 
A fast way to go from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics is to replace the 
energy and momentum of a particle by operators, according to the prescription 
E --> i8/8t

(2.1) 
Making the replacements in the non-relativistic relation E = p2  / 2  in,  and applying 
the result to the wave function, we obtain the Schr6dinger equation:

(2.2) 
Of course, this is not covariant under Lorentz transformations. For a covariant 
equation, we use the same trick on the relativistic relation E 2  = p2  + m2 . The 
result is the Klein—Gordon equation

we have a covariant equation — one that has the same form in all Lorentz frames. 
What is not clear is how to interpret v(x). 
By analogy with the Schr6dinger equation, we might interpret  /'  (x)  to be the 
wave function of a relativistic particle. That would require the existence of a 4- 
vector probability current density j", which should be conserved: ap 
O. How-
ever, the obvious choice Jo  = v*Ip is untenable, for zp*lp is Lorentz-invariant by 
assumption, and cannot be part of a 4-vector.

The root of the difficulty lies in the second time derivative in the Klein—Gordon

tized it by imposing the commutation relations 
411,(0) ,  qv (0) = (5 kie 
kk(0), goo)] = o 
(2.13) 
where 4, (0) is the hermitian conjugate of qk(0). This fixes the normalization of the 
field, left arbitrary by the Klein—Gordon equation. 

2.3 Energy and Momentum 
Since the Klein—Gordon equation is invariant under time translation, the origin 
of time is arbitrary. The commutations relations in fact hold at any time t: 
qv(t) 	
à kk, 
[qk (t), qw(t)] = 0 
which are equivalent to 
i [(r, t), 0(e, t)] = 6 3 (r — r') 
[0(r, t), 0(e, t)] = 0 
(2.14) 
(2.15) 
These are called equal-time commutators, which serve as initial conditions for the 
equation of motion. The unequal-time commutators must be calculated from the 
solutions, and contain dynamical information. 
In the present free-particle case, the equation of motion (2.11) is trivial to solve. 
For given wave number k there are two frequencies ±  w k, with 
wk 	
+ k2  + rn2 	
(2.16) 
Taking into account the reality property (2.10), we write the solution in the form 
qk(t) 
1 
ake —i wk 
wk t - 
(2.17) 
where ak and d'ir, are operators, with commutation relations determined by (2.14): 
[ak, akin = c5kk,  
[ak, ay] -= 0 	
(2.18) 
The normalization factor (2w) -1 /2  in (2.17) is chosen to make the commutators 
simple. We recognize that ak is an annihilation operator, and ai'f, a creation opera-
tor for a boson, as introduced in Section 1.5. The time-dependent quantized field 
operator can be represented in the form 
1 
0(r, t) =
2co k Q L 	
i- e — i(k.r — wkt)] 	
(2.19) 
N/  
The positive-frequency part (the first term) annihilates a particle, and the negative-
frequency part creates a particle. The negative-frequency part is absent in a non-
relativistic field, because the kinematic relation E = p 2/2m allows only one sign 
of the frequency. 
2.3 
Energy and Momentum 
Analogy with the harmonic oscillator suggests that the Hamiltonian of the free 
scalar field should be 
H = —1 
[I
k1 2  + w 2kigkI 2 ] 	
(2.20) 
2 

20 I 2 Scalar Fields 
In terms of the field 0 (x) = 
(r, t), it has the form 
H -= f r7-((x) 
7-((x) = —21  [00002 + iv 012 + m202] 	
(2.21) 
where Ii(x) is called the Hamiltonian density. The Lagrangian of the system can 
be obtained through the general relation L(q, 4) = p 4 — H(p , q): 
L = f d 3  rf 	
(2.22) 
where r(x) is the Lagrangian density given by 
f(x) = —2  1  [00 100 2 
iv 01 2 
m 2 0 2] 	
21  al, 
a Ito  _ rn2 02] 	
(2.23) 
The last form shows that the Lagrangian density is Lorentz invariant. In contrast, 
the Hamiltonian density, being an energy density, cannot be invariant. For this 
reason, relativistic theories are usually specified via the Lagrangian density. 
In terms of creation and annihilation operators, the Hamiltonian takes the diag-
onalized form 
H = 12, co, (ak  k 
1  )
2 	
(2.24) 
The zero-point energy diverges unless there is a cutoff; but the cutoff has no phys-
ical relevance, since the energy of any state relative to that of the vacuum is inde-
pendent of it. The energy of a particle is given by 
Wk  = Vk2  in2 	
(2.25) 
where k is its momentum, and  rn the rest mass. Accordingly, the total momentum 
operator is 
P = Lka -i ctk 	
(2.26) 
According to the general principles of quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is 
the generator of time evolution, through the Heisenberg equation of motion 
t)  
I  [H, 
(r, t)] = 	
(2.27) 
The formal solution yields 
(r, t) = ei Ht 
(r, 0)e—i 
t 	
(2.28) 
For consistency, we must show that this is consistent with the Klein—Gordon equa- 
tion, which we used to arrive at the solution (2.19). Substituting 0 (r, 0) from (2.19) 

into (2.28), we obtain

For the free-field Hamiltonian, we have (See Problem 2.1) 
e i H t ake —t t

This demonstrates that (2.29) is the same as (2.19). 
Again, according to general principles, the momentum operator P should gener-
ate spatial translations: 
P, 0(r, t) = VO(r, t) 	
(2.31) 
with formal solution 
0(r, t) 	0(0, t)e 	
(2.32) 
As a straightforward calculation shows, this is the same as (2.19).

Using the commutation relations, we find

(2.33) 
(2.34)

(2.36) 
The field operator has non-vanishing matrix elements only between a one-particle 
state and the vacuum: 
e i(p.r—co n t)

\/2(u p  
(2.37) 
This is the wave function of a particle of momentum p, normalized to a densi- 
ty (2a) p 
) -1 .By successively creating particles from the vacuum, we can build a

We define continuum versions of the annihilation and creation operators by 
putting 
a(k)

a i (k) - ./ ct 	
(2.39) 
The commutators then have limiting forms 
[a(k), at  (k')] = (2:70 3 6 3 (k — k') 
[a(k), a(k')] = 0 	
(2.40) 
The field operator can be represented as a Fourier integral: 
0(r, t) = f  d 3  k 	
1  	
 [a(k)e i(k. r— cok t)  + a (k)e—ikt) ] 
(LT) 3  \/2(0k 	
(2.41) 
As before, the vacuum state 10) is defined by a(k)10) = 0 with (010) = 1, and a 
one-particle state is defined by 
IP) = at  (P) 10) 	
(2.42) 
Using the commutation relations, we find 
a (k) 1p) = (2gr) 3  (5 3  (p — k) 10)

(2.45) 
The choice between discrete or continuum normalization is a matter of notation, 
since we always regard Q as large but finite in intermediate steps of calculations. 
The limit Q 
co is taken only in final answers. This is done to avoid irrelevant 
concerns about mathematical rigor, like how to define the Hilbert space when the 
dimensionality is noncountably infinite. The continuum normalization merely an-
ticipates this limit. 
2.6 
Complex Scalar Field 
A complex scalar field is just two real scalar fields constituting the real and imag-
inary parts. What is new is a symmetry between the two fields, and this leads to 
a conserved current. In physical terms, a complex field can have electric charge, 
whereas a real field must be neutral. 
We denote the complex scalar field by 'tp (r, t), and decompose it into real and 
imaginary parts in the form 
1 
= 71(9)1 + 2) 
The Lagrangian density is taken to be 
(2.46) 
L(x) -= 
(x)ktp(x)—rn 2 v) 	
)v(x) 
2  
= 	
[a" 	
(x)a, 	
(x) — m 2  (x)0 (x)] 
2 j=i  
(2.47) 
The normalization factor lhh in (2.46) is chosen in order that .95 j has the same 
normalization as the real scalar field discussed previously. 
To quantize the system, we impose the commutation relations 
i [
i (r, t), 0 1  (r', t)] = 	
(5 3 (r — r') 
[0 i (r, t), 	
1 (r',  t)] = 0 	
(2.48) 
The complex field v(r, t) becomes a non-hermitian operator satisfying 
i [ip (r, t), v)(r' t)] = (5 3 (r — r') 
[ip(r, t), y)(r', t)] 	t), 	
t)] =  Pp(r, t), 	
t)] = 0 	
(2.49) 
Thus, the canonical conjugate to p  is ipt.

There are two type of quanta, which can be designated either as al  and a2  quanta, 
or as b and c quanta. The energy and the momentum do not distinguish between 
these descriptions. We shall see, however, that only the b and c quanta have definite 
charge.

Charge and Antiparticle 
The current density for the complex scalar field is given by 
OpaiLtp*

(2.56) 
which satisfies the conservation law

Integrating both sides over the spatial volume, we obtain 
f

(2.58) 
Or 
dQ 
dt =o  
where 0 is the total charge operator 
Q= 
d3xj°(x) 
- E (a ai — 
k 
(b b 
— Ct  
(2.59) 
(2.60) 
As we can see, a b quantum carries one unit of positive charge, and a c quantum 
carries one unit of negative charge. The al , a 2  quanta, being linear combinations of 
those of b and c, do not have definite charge. By convention, we refer to a c quantum 
as an "antiparticle". Thus, the positive-frequency part of 
annihilates a particle, 
and its negative-frequency part creates an antiparticle. Similarly, lp 1-  either creates 
a particle or annihilates an antiparticle. In light of this, we can say that for the real 
field, the particle is its own antiparticle. 
The term "charge" is used in a generic sense, and does not necessarily mean the 
electric charge, since we have not turned on the electromagnetic coupling. The unit 
of charge is arbitrary, because j ," is defined only up to a multiplicative constant. 
It is straightforward to verify that charge is conserved: 
0 H] = 0 
(2.61) 
This implies that the number of particles N+ minus the number of antiparticles 
N_ is a constant of the motion. In the free-field case, this conservation law is trivial, 
since N± are separately conserved. It becomes significant when, in the presence of 
interactions, N+ are no longer conserved. In that case, N+ — N_ is still conserved 
as long as (2.61) holds.

Microcausality 
A classical signal propagating according to the Klein—Gordon equation has a group 
velocity

(2.62) 
which never exceeds 1. This means that events at two space-time points lying out-
side of each other's light cone, (or separated by a space-like interval,) cannot in-
fluence each other. In the quantum theory, this means that two field operators at 
points separated by a space-like interval must commute with each other. That is, 
[0(x), (x')] = 0 if (x — x') 2  <0 	
(2.63) 
This condition is called microcausality. We must verify that our quantized field the-
ory satisfies this condition. 
To compute the commutator in (2.63), note that it is a c-number 2), and at fixed x' 
it satisfies the Klein—Gordon equation, because q5 (x) does. The initial condition at 
x0  = x(f, is the equal-time commutator (2.15), which is a c-number. Therefore the 
commutator remains a c-number at all times, and we can equate it with its vacuum 
expectation value: 
(x) , 	
(y)] =1-  (0 1 [g6  (x) ,  (y)]1 0) 	
i A (x 	
Y) 
(2.64) 
This defines a Lorentz-invariant correlation function A (x — y), which depends on 
x — y, and not on x and y separately, because of the translational invariance of the 
vacuum state. (See Problem 2.1) We use the expansion (2.41) to obtain 
f

d 3  k sin(wk t)  e ik-r

cok 
Since A (x) is Lorentz invariant, it can only depend on the invariant 
x 2 = t2 — X2 
(2.65) 
(2.66) 
(2.67) 
If x is space-like, for which x2  < 0, we can put t = 0. By (2.66) thus gives 
(x) = ON. 
2) A c-number is a "classical" number, a multiple of the identity operator. 

2.9 The Feynman Propagator i 27 
The proof of microcausality depends on the initial condition from the commu-
tator in (2.15), which quantizes the system according to Bose statistics. Had we 
used Fermi statistics by replacing commutator with anticommutator, microcausal-
ity would have been violated. The particles here have spin 0, since there does not ex-
ist discrete degrees of freedom corresponding to spin. Our result is partial demon-
stration of the spin-statistics connection, which states that particles with integer spin 
are bosons, while those with half-integer spin are fermions. The second half of the 
statement will be shown in Chapter 6 on the Dirac field. 
2.9 
The Feynman Propagator 
The propagation of a free particle in the vacuum can be described by the correlation 
function 
A (+ ) (x2 — xi ) = —i(04(x2)/p (x1 )10) 	
(2.68) 
in which VI-  (x1 ) creates a particle from the vacuum at xi , and is annihilate by v (x2 ) 
at x2 . This make physically sense when t2  > ti . Similarly, the correlation function 
A (—) (x2  — xi ) = —i(011» r(xi)zp(x2)10) (2.69) 
describes the propagation of a test antiparticle from x2  to xi , and is physically 
meaningful when ti  > t2 . To obtain a correlation function that has physical mean-
ing, we use either 4 (+) or A (—) depending on the sign of the relative time. The 
result is the Feynman propagator, or causal propagator: 
A F(x2  — xi ) = —i(0rnp(x2)7p i (xi )io) 	
(2.70) 
where the time-ordering operator T rearranges the operators, if necessary, such 
that the operators stand in such order that time increases from right to left: 
1A(t 2)B(t 1 ) 
if t2  > ti  
TA(t2)B(t 1 ) = 	
(2.71) 
B(t 1 )A(t 2 ) 
if t2  < ti  
If t2  > ti , the Feynman propagator describes the propagation of a particle from x i 
 to 
x2 ; if t2  < t i , it describes the propagation of an antiparticle from x2  to xi . This 
is the basis of Feynman's famous remark: "An antiparticle is a particle traveling 
backwards in time". 
To calculate the propagator, we start with the expression 
A F(x) = —i (01V) (x)tpt (0) O) 
(010(0)1P (x )I0) 
if x°  >0  
if x°  <0  
(2.72) 
and insert a complete set of states between the operators. Since the field operator 
connects the vacuum to one-particle states only, we can write 
f  d 3 k  1(04(x)1k)(klIpt(0)10) 
if x° > 0 
AF(X) = — i

the propagation amplitude of a virtual particle of 4-momentum 10. The virtual par-
ticle, whose squared mass k 2  ranges between  —oc and oc,  becomes a real particle 
when it "goes on mass shell", at k 2  = m2 .

To calculate any functional derivative, we need the elementary functional derivative 
c5 (x)1 6 0 (y), which is obviously proportional to 6 (x — y). To determine the pro-
portionality constant, we replace the continuous space of x by a lattice of spacing a, 
and denote by 0 the value of the function on site j.  Clearly,

where we have assumed that boundary conditions are so chosen that surface inte-
grals from partial integrations vanish. 
A functional integral is defined as the limit of an ordinary integral. Again, let us 
replace continuous space by a lattice of discrete points labeled by]. A function 0(x) 
becomes a discrete set of values {0 j }, and a functional F[0] becomes a function of 
this set F(0 1 , 0 2 , • • • ). The functional integral of F is defined as 
	 00 
f DOF[0]=Clif dOiF(.75 1 , 02,— )

(2.101) 
where C is a normalization constant. The continuum limit is to be taken eventually. 
Alternatively, we put the system in a large cube of volume  Q, with periodic 
boundary conditions. The Fourier components -0 (k) of 0(x) are then discrete. The 
functional integral over 0 can be defined as the multiple integral over all Fourier 
components independently:

In either of the above methods, the integral by itself may not have a continuum

forming a partial integration in every term, and sum the series again. The surface

field has the functional form q5(r) in the vacuum state. The relative probability for 
the field to have a functional form lying in the neighborhood of 0 in the volume

I v[0 ]1 2  D 
The most probable form is 0 	
0, and deviations from it occur with a Gaussian-

To quantize the theory, we impose the equal-time commutators (2.15), which can 
be satisfied by taking as initial condition

Chapter 9.

Problem 2.1 Space-time Translation 
Consider a free scalar field q) (x), which can be expanded in terms of the an-
nihilation operators ak. This problem illustrates the fact that the 4-momentum

Problem 2.2 Charge Conjugation 
The designation of particle and antiparticle is a matter of convention, and we can 
freely reverse the labels. More specifically, for a complex scalar field  O (x), construct 
an operator C that takes bk to ck and vice versa, and commutes with Hamiltoni-
an H: 
p (x) C -1  = e i Y 	
(x) 
[H, C] = 0 
Ct C = 1 
C 2  = 1 
where y is an arbitrary phase angle. The operation C is called charge conjugation, 
or particle-antiparticle conjugation. 
Problem 2.3 Lorentz Invariance 
We have calculate the function A (x) = (01[0(x), 0 (0)]10) in (2.66), but not in a 
manifestly Lorentz-invariant form. Show that it can be put into the desired form

where E(ko) denotes the sign of ko . 
Problem 2.4 Spin and Statistics 
Quantize the real scalar field according to Fermi statistics, i.e., replace the commu-
tators in (2.15) by anticommutators. In this case, microcausality requires that field 
operators at positions separated by a space-like interval anticommute with each 
other. Show that this is not the case., and thus a spin-zero field cannot obey Fermi 
statistics. 
Problem 2.5 External Source

Lagrangian density

result will be a divergent integral. Cut it off at a large momentum A. This 
illustrates a prototype of divergence in quantum field theory. 
c) Show that all levels of the system shift by the same amount, and therefore the 
divergence in this case has no physical relevance. 
Problem 2.6 Yukawa Potential 
Continuing with the last two problems, suppose the source function J(x) consists 
of two static point sources located at r1 , r2 : 
J(r, t) = g [6 3 (r — ri ) + 6 3 (r — r2)] 
Treating g as a perturbation, calculate the change in the vacuum energy to second 
order in g, and show that there is an attractive potential between the two point 
sources:

where R = 1r 1  — r2 1. This is the Yukawa potential, originally proposed as the poten-
tial between two nucleons due to interactions with scalar mesons. 
Problem 2.7 Vacuum Fluctuations 
Consider a free scalar field in a large periodic box of volume  Q.  Let the Fourier 
transform be denoted 
(k) = 	
f d 3  re— ` 1" (r)

a) Show that the vacuum expectation value of -,i)(k) is zero. 
b) By expanding the field in terms of creation and annihilation operators, show 
that the mean-square fluctuation of the Fourier transform is given by 
(01:73 2 (k)10) = 
2,\/k2  + m2  
c) The mean-square average can be expressed in the field representation as 
(010 2 (k)10) = f Do -9-52(k) wo2[0]  
where W0 [0] is the wave functional of the free vacuum state. Reproduce the last 
result from this formula. 
d) Calculate the mean-square fluctuation (010 2  (x)10) in coordinate space. The re-
sult is divergent because of the high-momentum modes. Exhibit its depen-
dence on the cutoff momentum A.

Relativistic Fields 
3.1 
Lorentz Transformations 
Relativistic quantum fields can be classified according to the way they transform 
under Lorentz transformations. More specifically, they transform according to ir-
reducible representations of the Lorentz group. The different representations give 
rise to particles with different values of the spin angular momentum. 
According to the principle of special relativity, the laws of physics should be co-
variant with respect to Lorentz transformations, i.e., they should have the same 
forms in all reference frames connected by Lorentz transformations. The simplest 
Lorentz transformation is a "boost" of the reference frame with velocity v along 
some axis, say the x axis: 
tl  = t — v x 
— v 2  
X  — v t 
(3.1) 
V1 — v 2  
This may be supplemented by a rotation of the coordinate system, say, about the z 
axis through an angle 0: 
X'  = x cos 0 + y sin 0 
y' = —x sin 0 + y cos 0

(3.4) 
The inverses of these matrices can be obtained by reversing the signs of 0 and  O,  
respectively. The rotation matrices are orthogonal matrices, while the Lorentz 
boosts are not, because the invariant form t 2  — x 2  for the Lorentz boost is not 
positive-definite. 
The angles of rotation are not additive, unless the rotations are all made about 
the same axis. Similarly, the velocities of successive Lorentz boosts are not additive, 
unless the boots are all made along the same direction. 
We use a relativistic notation in which the coordinate 4-vector is denoted by xP = 
(t, r) and the metric tensor is diagonal: 
glt

(3.5)

A general Lorentz transformation is a linear transformation A on x that leaves 
x2 = t2 
r2  invariant: 
= 	
(3.6) 
with the requirement 
g1 AA — g afi 	
(3.7) 
which ensures the invariance of x 2 . As a short hand, we write the transformation 
in the form 
X' A 
= x 	
(3.8) 
The transformations above form the continuous Lorentz group, which is character-
ized by 6 parameters: 3 velocity components, and 3 angles of rotation. As we can 
see from (3.4), they are represented by matrices with determinant +1. In contrast, 
the discrete transformations

have determinant —1. These discrete elements together with the continuous 
Lorentz transformations form the general Lorentz group. We shall reserve the 
name "Lorentz transformation" for the continuous Lorentz transformations. 
Any element of the Lorentz group can be built up from infinitesimal ones, with 
the general form 
g`i; + 	
(3.10) 
We write in short hand 
A =1+ w 	
(3.11) 
Lorentz transformations generally do not commute with one other; but the in-
finitesimal transformations do, because their commutators are of second order 
smallness: 
(1 + (01 ) (1 + (02) = 1 ± w1 + (02 	
0(w 2 )

Minimal Representation: SL(2C) 
It is well-known that the smallest faithful representation of the rotation group is

group, the minimal representation is SL(2C), the linear group of 2 x 2 complex

matrices of unit determinant. To see this, let us organize the coordinates into a 
2 x 2 complex matrix:

X  — i y) 
t — z

a = la 
(and cyclic permutations) 
[0.1, a2] = 2 i  0.3 
(and cyclic permutations) 	
(3.18) 
The cyclic relation can also be expressed in the form 
j ak = ic jict at 	
(j o k) 	
(3.19) 
where summation convention is used. We see that 
det X = x 2  
(3.20) 
A Lorentz transformation that takes X into X' can be represented by the opera-
tion 
X' = L(A)X L (A) 	
(3.21) 
where L(A) is a 2 x 2 complex matrix, and Lt (A) its hermitian conjugate. Taking 
the determinant of both sides, we have 
det X'  = det X I det L(A)1 2 	
(3.22) 
To preserve x 2 , we must have det X' = det X, and hence 
det L(A) = +1 	
(3.23) 
Consequently det A = +1. This is a more formal proof of a result stated earlier. 
The matrices L(A) with det L = 1 constitute the group SL(2C). 
Any 2 x 2 matrix can be represented in the form 
A + B3 B1 — 1B2 
A + (B u) = (B1  ± _s2  
id 	
A —  B3)  
(3.24) 
where A and Bk are real numbers. The determinant of the above is A2  — E k  B. 
Hence L(A) is a matrix of this form, with A2  — E k  B i2c  = 1. We leave it as exercises

The Poincaré Group 
The laws of physics should be covariant with respect to space-time translations as 
well as Lorentz transformations. These transformations combined constitute the 
inhomogeneous Lorentz group, or the Poincaré group. The transformation law is 
as follows:

where a," is a 4-vector. The infinitesimal version has the form 
(3.27)

From (3.31) we obtain the commutator

Though derived from an explicit representation, we consider the above as abstract 
algebraic relations. Such a procedure is analogous to obtaining the Lie algebra 
[ ji ,  pc] , iEjkiji for angular momentum from the special representation J = 
—ir x V. As abstract relations, the Lie algebra admits half-integer representations. 
The Lie algebra of the Poincaré group consists of the following commutators:

make up the total 4-momentum operator, and P°  = H is the Hamiltonian. The 6 
independent components of MY' are generalized angular momentum operators.

Pi , P k ] =  [PI,  H] = [Ji, H] = 0 
i Ejkl pl

(3.37) 

3.4 Scalar, Vector, and Spinor Fields 
These relations all involve the inhomogeneous part of the group. The first equation 
above expresses the independence of the spatial translations among themselves, of 
spatial and time translations, and of rotations and time translations. The second 
equation is what one can deduce from J = — ir x V and P = — iV. The other equa-
tions above describe how energy and momentum change under a Lorentz boost. 
In addition to these, we obtain from (3.34) a closed set of commutation relations 
among angular momentum and boost operators: 
jI , jk 
i ejklil 
i e jkl JI 
K1 ,  K 
ji ,  Kk] = IEJuKI 
 
(3.38) 
These form the Lie algebra of the Lorentz group. 
3.4 
Scalar, Vector, and Spinor Fields 
In quantum mechanics, the wave functions in a central potential can be classified 
according to orbital angular momenta, which correspond to irreducible represen-
tations of the rotation group, with possible dimensions 21 + 1, (1 = 0, 1, 2, ...). In a 
similar way, relativistic fields transform according to irreducible representations of 
the Lorentz group, which have definite dimensions. Accordingly, a relativistic field 
has a definite number of components, related to the spin angular momentum of 
the field. 
The simplest relativistic field is a scalar field, which may have more than one 
component, but each component ç (x) must be invariant under Lorentz transfor-
mations: 
(11(x') = 0(x) 	
(3.39) 
This says that the transformed field called q5', at the transformed coordinate x', 
is the same as the original field called 
, at the old coordinate x. It expresses the 
fact that x' and x are different labels we use for the same physical point, and the 
scalar field does not care about that; but to us the functional form of the field must 
change: 
4/(x) = 0(A -1 x) 	
(3.40) 
As we shall see, the spin of a scalar field is zero. 
A vector field, such as the electromagnetic field AY (x), does care about a change 
in the coordinate system, since by definition its 4 components transform among 
themselves like xi'. The transformation law is 
4 
26V1'(x l) = 	
A' (x) 	
= 0, 1, 2, 3) 	
(3.41) 
The spin of a vector field is 1. This will be demonstrated in Section 5.5.

In general, a tensor field of rank n transforms like a product of nx/vs, and cor-
responds to spin n. For example, the gravitational field is a symmetric tensor of 
rank 2. 
There are "half-integer" representations, analogous to those for the rotation 
group. The latter are representations of SU(2), which generalizes to SL(2C) in 
the present case. To accommodate space-time reflections, we have to include two 
copies of SL(2C), so that they transform into each other under a reflection. Accord-
ingly, the minimal representation space is spanned by a 4-component complex 
field, called the Dirac spinor field  p (x) , which transforms according to 
V ir (xt) = Srs (A)/) s(X)(r = 1, 2,  3,4) 	
(3.42) 
where S (A) is a 4 x 4 complex matrix discussed in more detail in Chapter 6. The 
spin of a spinor field is 1/2. 
In general, a field forming a K-dimensional irreducible representation of the 
Lorentz group has K components: 
a(x) 	
(a =- 1, 2, ... , K) 	
(3.43) 
which transform under a Lorentz transformation A according to 
= S ab(A)0b(x) 	
(3.44) 
For an infinitesimal transformation A = 1 ± co, we can put S (A) in the form 
Sab = 6  ab 	
LevI ktilv  
2 	
a, 
(3.45) 
this defines the coefficients Z:by , which, as we will show, constitute the spin matrix. 
Under an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation, then, a general field transforms 
according to 
qvc,(x 1) = o.(x) + (0„,,E:bv 95 b (x) 
The change in the functional form of the field can be found by writing 
(3.46) 
Thus, 
O fa (xt ) 
qVa (x ± cox) = qVa (x) + co 	
a/.`

(3.48) 
Substituting .75',(x l ) from (3.45), we obtain 
qVa(x) = 0,(x) -1- —21  wyv  [(x,"av — xv F)ôab + 	
b(X) 	 (3.49) 

3.5 Relativistic Quantum Fields 
47 
This identifies the K x K matrices X ,"' = 	
v" as spin matrices, since they are 
added to the generalized orbital angular momentum. 
The spin matrix for a scalar field is obviously zero. For the vector field, we can 
find it from it transformation law under an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation: 
A(x 1) = A a (x) 	
af3A '(X)

3.5 
Relativistic Quantum Fields 
Since quantum fields are operators that act on a Hilbert space, we can represent 
Lorentz transformations by transformations on the Hilbert space. Recall that a 
Lorentz transformation changes the functional form of a classical field: 
0,(x) ---> O la(x) 	
(3.53) 
In the quantized version, this means that the operator Ø a  attached to point x is 
replaced by Ota . Since çb a  and O ta  act on the same Hilbert space, the transforma-
tion is a mapping of the Hilbert space into itself. Since 
a  and q5',„ are physically 
equivalent, the transformation must be unitary. Thus, there should exist a unitary 
operator U(A) on the Hilbert space, corresponding to the Lorentz transformation 
A, such that 
gYa(x) = U(A)q5 a(x)U-1 (A) 	
(3.54) 
That the transformation is unitary means 
U 1 (A) =- U-1 (A) 	
(3.55) 
From the definition of the primed fields C,(x') = Sab 
b( X), we obtain the condi-
tion 
uo 
(x ) u-1  = 	
b (A —1  x) 	
(3.56) 

48 
3 Relativistic Fields 
The set of operators U(A ) forms an infinite-dimensional unitary representation of 
the Lorentz group. In contrast to this, the finite-dimensional representations of the 
Lorentz group are non-unitary. As examples, we have 
Scalar field: 
U (x)  U 	
0(A -1 x) 
Vector field: 
U AP (x) U-1  = 	
A"(A —1 x) 
Spinor field: 
Uv r(x) U-1  = S rop s (A —l x) 	
(3.57) 
We can immediate extend the above consideration to Poincaré transformations: 
UO ta(x)U 
= SabOb(A —l x — a) 
(3.58) 
For infinitesimal Poincaré transformations, U must be in the neighborhood of the 
identity operator, and linear in the parameters of the Poincaré group: 
U = 1 — i aP 	
— 	 MP" 	
(3.59) 
2 
This defines the hermitian operators PP and MP", which represent the generators 
of the Poincaré group on the Hilbert space. In contrast, the generators denoted by 
the same symbols in (3.31) are finite matrices, generally non-hermitian. 
Substituting (3.59) into (3.58), we obtain 
(1 — ia • P 
—
2
co • M) 0,(x) (1 
i a • P — —
2 w • M) 
( 6  ab 
—2 (0  • rab) b (X — aix — a) 	
(3.60) 
which is written in an obvious abbreviated notation. Expanding both sides to first 
order in aP and wit", and equating their coefficients, we obtain 
[P", a(x)] = 
i [MP", „(x)] = (x," 	
— x"0") 
a (x) 	
l'aPbv  b(x) 	
(3.61) 
This shows that PP is the 4-momentum operator, since it generates space-time 
translations, and MP" is a generalized angular momentum operator, since it gen-
erates space-time rotations. The spin matrix Ta b induces a mixing of the field com-
ponents undergoing space-time rotation. 
The generators PP and MP" can be constructed explicitly from the field operators 
a. Rather than doing this on a case-by-case basis, we shall do it via a unified 
approach in the next chapter. 
3.6 
One-Particle States 
A one-particle state is an eigenstate of PP, with energy eigenvalue E > 0, and 
momentum eigenvalue p, such that the invariant mass squared 
p2 = E2 
p2 
m2 
(3.62) 

3.6 One-Particle States 
is a fixed number. Such a state corresponds to a particle of mass m. The P 2  of any 
state generally lies in a continuum, but those of one-particle states form a discrete 
set. If there are no massless particles, the invariant-mass spectrum of a field theory 
consists of the vacuum value 0 as a lower bound, a discrete set of particle masses, 
and a continuum separated from the vacuum value by a finite gap. The continuum 
corresponds to states containing two or more particles, whose masses occur within 
the gap. There can be particles whose mass occurs in the continuum, but only if 
these particles are stable against decay, dues to selection rules. The gap vanishes 
when there are massless particles, such as the photon. In this case, there is a dis-
crete mass in the continuum corresponding to the electron, which cannot decay 
into photons due to conservation laws. 
The one-particle states of a free field can be generated by applying creation op-
erators al-  to the vacuum state. If we do this for a non-free field, we will not get 
one-particle states, because we will not get eigenstates of  P".  Instead, we will have a 
mixture of states involving interacting particles. Nevertheless, we can discuss prop-
erties of a one-particle state through general considerations, without constructing 
it explicitly. 
We confine our attention to massive particles, with m > O. There exists a Lorentz 
frame in which p = 0, called the rest frame. The spin operator S of the one-particle 
state is defined as the total angular momentum in the rest frame. The eigenvalue of 
S2  has the form S(S + 1), where S is called the spin of the particle. The projection 
s of S along the momentum of the particle is called the helicity, which for m > 0 
has 2S  1 possible values S,S — 1,...,
— S. We can label a one-particle state by 
momentum p and helicity s: 
lone-particle state) = jp, s) 	
(3.63) 
The parameters m and S are suppressed, because they are constants. 
For m > 0 a one-particle state in the rest frame is denoted by Is), and we can 
obtain I p, s) from I s) through a Lorentz boost L(p). Here, L(p) stands for a 4-tensor 
of the same type as the generic A li', . It should not be confused with L (A) 
in (3.25), which is a 2 x 2 matrix. 
The state of a particle can thus be represented as 
jp, s) = U (L(p)) Is) 	
(3.64) 
Under a Lorentz transformation A, this state transforms according to 
U(A)1p, s) = U(A)U (L(p)) Is) 	
(3.65) 
We expect that the momentum is changed from p to A p, and the spin might un-
dergo a rotation. To exhibit these changes explicitly, insert in front of the right side 
the identity operator in the form 1 
U (L(A p)) U-1  (L(A p)): 
U(A)Ip, s) =  U (L(Ap))[U -1  (L(Ap)) U(A)U (L(p))]Is) 	
(3.66) 
The motivation is to write the state in the form of a boost to A p from some state. 
By the group property, the factors in the square brackets can be identified with a

50 
single operation: 
U-1  (L(Ap)) U(A)U (L(p)) = U (L -1  (Ap)A L(p)) 
This represents a rotation of the spin called the Wigner rotation: 
R(A,p)
=-7.- L-1 (Ap)AL(p) 
(3.67) 
(3.68) 
which boosts a particle from rest to momentum p, makes Lorentz transforma-
tion A, and then boosts the particle back to rest. The state vector of the particle 
is unchanged, except possibly by a phase factor, which represents a rotation. Thus 
the Lorentz transformation A can be represented as 
U(A)lp, s) = U (L(Ap)) U(R)Is) 	
(3.69) 
That is, the spin is first rotated by R  (A,  p) in the rest frame, and the resulting state 
is then boosted to momentum Ap. 
A more explicit representation of the Wigner rotation can be obtained by insert-
ing a complete set of helicity states to obtain 
U(A)lp, s) = L U (L(Ap)) Is') (sl IU(R))Is) 
si 
where 
L Dsss,(R) Ap, s') 
s,  
(3.70) 
asss,(R) = (si  lU(R))1s)

is the rotation matrix for spin S. A physical example of the Wigner rotation is the 
Thomas precession of the electron discussed in Section 6.8. An example of a gen-
eral Wigner rotation is worked through in Problem 3.6. 
Massless particle are special, in that there is no rest frame. A massless particle of 
spin S can only have the two values of the helicity ± S. We shall explicitly demon-
strate this for photons in Section 5.5. A general proof may be found in books on 
representations of the Lorentz group 3) .

as the photon, is Lorentz invariant.

4.1 
Principle of Stationary Action 
The equations of motion for a classical field can be derived from a Lagrangian 
through the principle of stationary action. This approach gives a unified treatment 
of topics discussed previously through special examples. It also makes clear that 
symmetries of the system give rise to conservation laws. Consider a set of classical 
fields collectively denoted by 
(x): 
0(x) = 	
(4.1) 
We denote their space-time derivatives by 
0(x) 	
aji 0(x) 	
(4.2) 
The Lagrangian density is assumed to depend on the fields and their first deriva-
tives: 
f(x) —= L(¢) (x), 
1,(x)) 	
(4.3) 
This will ensure that the equations of motion are second-order differential equa-
tions in the time, as in classical mechanics. We assume that, unless external fields 
are explicitly introduced, space-time is homogeneous. Thus, G(x) depend on x not 
explicitly, but only implicitly through 0(x) and çb ,u  (x). We consider only local field 
theories, for which the Lagrangian density at x depends only on properties of the 
field at x. Non-local terms of the form 
f
d4 y0,,(y)K ab(x — Y)Ob(Y)

are ruled out, unless Ka  b(x — y) oc c5 (x — y).

where Q is the space-time volume, which eventually goes to infinity. We impose 
definite boundary conditions on the surface of  Q, say 
= 0. The principle of 
stationary action, which is a generalization of that in classical mechanics, states 
the following: 
Suppose 0(x) is a solution to the equations of motion. If we vary its functional 
form by adding an arbitrary infinitesimal function 60(x) that preserves the 
boundary condition: 
0(x) -± 0(x) -I-  ô (x) 	
(x) = 0 on boundary of Q 
then the variation of the action will be of second-order smallness: 
OS 
S[0 ± 60] — S[0] = 0 
This means that S[0] is at an extremum when q5 (x) is a solution to the equation of 
motion. 
To find the equation of motion according to this principle, let us calculate the 
variation of the Lagrangian density: 
ar 	
ac 
(5,C = —WO + 	
(4.6) 
Using the fact that 
O 95  = (5(ay o)=a(60) 	
(4.7) 
we get

The last term is a total 4-divergence. It vanishes when integrated over the space-
time volume, since it then becomes a surface integral by Gauss' theorem, and 
(50 = 0 on the surface. Thus 
as= f crx ar
au ( ar)-- 
 ao 60 = 0 	
(4.9) 
Since (50(x) is arbitrary, its coefficient must vanish. We thus obtain the equation 
of motion

4.2 Noether's Theorem 
The independent variables of the local field are 0 (x) and aP o(x). The Hamilto-
nian density is defined by 
7-4x) 	
— G(x) 	
(4.13) 
The independent local variables are 7r, 0, ak  0. Thus, 0 should be re-expressed in 
terms of 7r according to (4.12). The Hamiltonian is given by 
H =-- 	
d 3 x7i(x) 	
(4.14) 
To quantize the system, we replace the field and its canonical conjugate by opera-
tors, which are defined by the equal-time commutators 
= (53  (x — y) 
i [r (x, t), r(y, t)]+  = [0(x, t), 0(y, t)]+ = 0 	
(4.15) 
where for boson we use the commutator 
[A, B]_ 
[A, B] = AB — B A 
and for fermions we use the anticommutator 
[A, B]+ = IA, B1 
AB ± BA 
(4.16) 
(4.17) 
If (x, t) 	
0, as is the case for the electromagnetic field, then the field conjugate to 
.7r(x, t) is not an independent dynamical variable, and should not be independently 
quantized. 
4.2 
Noether's Theorem 
A transformation 0 (x) —> 0(x) + ç5(x) is called a symmetry transformation of the 
system, if it changes the Lagrangian density only by the addition of a 4-divergence. 
As we have seen, this does not change the equations of motion. More specifically, 
the change must be of the form G(x) = EJ W (x) for arbitrary 0(x), whether or 
not it obeys the equation of motion. If the symmetry transformation is continuous, 
then there is an associated conserved current density. The formal statement is as 
follows. 
Theorem 4.1 Noether's Theorem [1,2] 
If, under a continuous infinitesimal transformation 
0(x) —> 0(x) c 50(x) 
the change in the Lagrangian density is found to be of the form 
G(x) =

where the equation of motion was used in the last step. Specializing the above to 
symmetry transformations, we equate the above with a,„\v" to obtain 
e(50 — vv") =  0 
The conserved current j12 is called a Noether current, and is determined only up 
to an arbitrary normalization factor. 
Noether's theorem was proven for classical fields, and one usually extends it to 
quantum theory by replacing the fields in j by the corresponding quantized fields. 
This does not always give a conserved current in the quantum theory. When the 
quantum current so obtained fails to be conserved, the nonzero divergence a,„ j" 
is called a "current anomaly". Some examples of this are discussed in Section 19.8. 
4.3 
Translational Invariance 
An important symmetry for any system is Poincaré invariance, which is called a 
"space-time symmetry", because it is associated with the transformation of the field 
under a change in the coordinate system. We discuss this symmetry by breaking 
up the Poincaré group into the translation and Lorentz subgroups. 
Invariance under the translation group should give rise to 4 independent Noether 
currents corresponding to the 4 possible space-time translations. Consider an in-
finitesimal translation

under which each component of 
(x) independently transforms according to 
'(x + a) = 0(x). The functional form of the field changes according to 
0 1 (x) = 0(x — a) = 0(x) — 	
0(x) 	
(4.21) 
We shall choose al, to have only one non-vanishing component, say 	
and take 
a = 0, 1, 2, 3 in turn. Thus, the change in functional form of the field is 
(50(x) = 0"0(x) 	
(4.22) 
where we have dropped the proportionality constant —a„, because it enters all sub-
sequent formulas only through the overall normalization of the Noether current. 
Differentiating the above with respect to x ," gives 
(50 11 (x) = a'0„(x)

(x) = 0 	
(4.27) 
This is called the canonical energy-momentum tensor. It is generally not a symmet-
ric tensor. The subscript c, which stands for "canonical", distinguishes it from a 
symmetrized version to be discussed later. 
The conservation law can be rewritten in the form

where

is the total 4-momentum. Thus, Tic3°  is the energy density, and VcDk  the k-th compo-

is clear that Tck°  is the k-th component of the energy current, and Tcki  is the 
k-th component of the current of the  'J-th  component of momentum". The latter 
is called the stress-energy tensor. These components are displayed in the following 
matrix:

(4.32) 
The identification of T°°  as the energy density is consistent with the definition of 
the Hamiltonian density in (4.13). 
The explicit expressions for the total energy and momentum are 
P°  =f d3  x (x) k  b (x) — L(x) = f d 3  xR(x) 
pk 	
f d3 xyr(x )ak (x) 	
(4.33) 
where a dot denotes time derivative, and 7-1(x) is the Hamiltonian density. We go 
over to the quantum theory by replacing 7r(x) and 0 (x) by the appropriate opera-
tors. 
To show that Pk  generates spatial translations, we calculate the commutator of 
0(x) with the total momentum operator 
Pk  =f co y
(y)8( y ) 	
(4.34) 
The above does not depend on yo . We are therefore free to choose yo  =xo  = t, to 
take advantage of the simplicity of the equal-time commutators. Thus, we have

4.4 Lorentz Invariance 
To show that P°  generates time translations, we calculate 
[P°, (x, t)] = f d3  y {[yr(y, t)b(y, t), 
(x, t)] — [L(y, t), 0(x, t)ll 
= —i0(x, t) 	
f d3 y {yr(y, t) [0(y, t), (x, t)] — [C(y, t), 
(x, 	
(4.36) 
The integral in the second term identically vanishes. 
Proof: Use the representation 0 = i 6 Id .7t to write 
6 0(y) 
[0 (Y) ,  0(x)] = 	
ào_r(x) 
3 	
a0(y) 
i (x

Using yt = aL • b , we can calculate the integral as follows:

a,c(x) 
ab x) a7r(x) 	
a:r(x) 
Combining the above results, we have 
i [Pa , 0(x)] = 	
(x) 
This shows that the total 4-momentum generates space-time translations. 
If F is a function of 0 and its derivatives, then 
[P", F] = a" F 
0 
(4.37) 
(4.38) 
Choosing, in particular, F = 	
, we have i  [Pa,  1) ,"] = aa 	
. The right side van- 
ishes because PP is independent of space by construction, and independent of time 
by 4-momentum conservation. Thus 
[P", PP] = 0 
(4.39) 
which is part of the Poincaré algebra discussed in the last chapter. It is realized 
here in terms of the field operators. 
4.4 
Lorentz Invariance 
Consider an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation in the direction labeled by {a, fi } . 
For example, a rotation about the x 3  axis corresponds to 11, 21, and a boost along 
the x 1  axis corresponds to 10, 11. Under the transformation, the functional form 

62 I 4 Canonical Formalism 
of the field changes by 0(x), as given by (3.46). We have, up to a multiplicative 
constant, 
60(X) = (X a afi  — X/ 3  aa 	
(4.40) 
where a/3  is the spin matrix, antisymmetric in {a, /3 } . Differentiating ô q5 with 
respect to acl` , we find 
0,„ (x) = xaafi — xfi a. + 
(x) + (41,0 
— g1,3  45 a ) 	(4.41) 
Using the fact that L(x) has no explicit x-dependence, we have 
ai: 	
ai:  
= 	+ 	
  
a 0 	
u y  
= (ea,' — xfiaa) + —
aL X afi  + "l c°  Op  + gra  0/3  — q5 a  
a 0 
(4.42) 
The statement of Lorentz invariance is that the above is a 4-divergence. The 
first term is of the desired form, for it can be rewritten afi (xa — 	
L) = 
a, (g`i xa 
— 	 x 13  L). Therefore the rest must vanish: 
a o 	
+ Ic°  y  Yr a  O P  — 7r 13  q5 a  = 0 	
(4.43) 
With this, we have 
a = a„ (efi 	
— guaxfi,c) 	
(4.44) 
which gives 
WY(x) = (efixa — eax) L(x) 	
(4.45) 
This leads to 6 independent Noether currents labeled by la, fif: 
Mrfi = grf` (x° — xaa 	
(x)  (et3  XcluaX 13  G(x) 
(4.46) 
which can be written in the form 
Mr/3 (x) = x° 	
(x) — x' 	
(x) + yr"Zafi 0(x) 	
(4.47) 
where Tr is the canonical energy-momentum tensor. It satisfies the conservation 
law 
= 0 	
(4.48) 
and is called the canonical angular momentum tensor.

The first two terms above represent orbital angular momentum, and the last term 
is the intrinsic spin. 
It is straightforward to verify that Ki and J I` generate Lorentz transformations 
by showing 
f d3 y mc0a/3(y,  t), 0(x, t) 
c50(x, t) 	
(4.51) 
where 6,95 is given by (4.40). It can also be verified that the commutation relations 
among the operators PI' and M,Ou/3  realize the Poincaré algebra (3.31). 
4.5 
Symmetrized Energy-Momentum Tensor 
The canonical energy-momentum tensor Tr is not unique, because the La-
grangian density is defined only up to a 4-divergence. We can replace it by any 
tensor of the form 
(4.52) 
where X'IP" is antisymmetric in Ay: 
x4la —xPAa 	
(4.53) 
The antisymmetry is a sufficient condition that the conservation law be unchanged: 
a T" = a ( 1-'"" ±

A possible change in the total 4-momentum is

which vanishes for the following reasons. (a) The term with 2 = 0 vanishes because 
xoou = 0 by antisymmetry. (b) The terms from 2  =  k vanish because they gives a 
surface integral. From a physical point of view, therefore, Pm is equivalent to 
because they give the same total 4-momentum. 
The fact that Tr is not guaranteed to be a symmetric tensor, poses a problem 
if it is to be used as a source of the gravitational field. We can, however, replace it 
with a equivalent symmetric tensor T. The condition for symmetry is 
1 
T" —

(x I." — X )1") = 0

(4.59) 
This term is needed only when the spin is nonzero. 
Corresponding to the symmetrized energy-momentum tensor, we can define a 
new angular momentum tensor: 
xa ritt3  — x t3 T 	
(4.60) 
This is related to the canonical angular momentum tensor through 
mitaP

It is easy to show that MP° is conserved, and that it preserves the definition of the 
boost and the angular momentum:

f d 3 xm° 0  = f d3 xm c°0 	
(4.62) 
From a physical point of view, therefore, MY a13  and MrP  are equivalent. 

4.6 Gauge Invariance 
65 
4.6 
Gauge Invariance 
In contrast to space-time symmetries, there are internal symmetries, which are 
x-independent transformations of the field that leaves the Lagrangian density in-
variant. 
A simple example is a change of phase in a complex scalar field: 
7,0 (x) 
 
(x) 	
eia 	
(x) 	
(4.63) 
This is called a global gauge transformation, where the label "global" refers to the 
fact that a is independent of x. Invariance with respect to it means that the La-
grangian density is independent of the phase. This is true for the free field, in 
which the fields appear in the combination v 1- (x)zp (x) or aft tpt (x)a,,v)(x). The 
infinitesimal form of the transformation is 
611)(x) = Ip(x) 
6V) (x) = ---tp(x) 	
(4.64) 
where we left out a proportionality constant i a. 
In terms of the real and imaginary parts defined by 
zp(x) = 	
[0 1 (x) ± i0 2 (x)] 
2 
1 [01(x) 	
io2(x)] 	
(4.65)

the transformation is a rotation in internal space: 
0 11 (x) =0 1 (x) cos a + 02(x) sin a 
0 12 (x) = —95 1 (x) sin a + 0 2 (x) cos a 	
(4.66) 
The Noether current is just the conserved current mentioned in Chapter 2:

(4.67) 
More generally, internal symmetries are linear transformations for a multicom-
ponent field O a  (x), (a = 1, 	
, K), of the form 
O ia(x) = CabOb(x) 	
(4.68) 
where Ca b are elements of a Kx K constant matrix. If the matrix belongs to a 
K-dimensional representation of some group G, we call G an internal symmetry 

4 Canonical Formalism 
group. The group can be continuous or discrete. In the previous example G =- 
U(1), the unitary group of dimension 1. 
Physical examples of conserved charges are 
•
electric charge = positive minus negative charge 
• baryon number = number of protons minus number of antiprotons 
•
electron number = number of electrons minus number of positrons 
A important case is isospin, which is discussed in Section 7.5. 
Problems 
Problem 4.1 
Consider a field 0 (x) with Lagrangian density L o (x) 
L i  (x), where the first term 
has a certain symmetry, while the second term does not. That is, under a transfor-
mation 0(x) —> 0(x) ± 0(x), 
(5,c0(x)= aft 
 
whereas L l (x) cannot be put into the above form. If L i (x) were absent, the system 
would have a conserved Noether current. Show that, in the presence of L i (x), the 
divergence of the would-be Noether current is 6L i (x).

ance, and global gauge invariance. 
Problem 4.4 Modified Field Representation 
Since lp (r) and i t (r) are canonical conjugates in the non-relativistic system, it 
would be awkward to introduce the field representation by diagonalizing  p (r).

Problem 4.5 First-order Lagrangian 
The non-relativistic Lagrangian in the last problem differs from a relativistic one, 
in that it is first-order instead of second-order in the time derivative. The Dirac field 
discussed in Chapter 7 also has a first-order Lagrangian. To frilly  explore the consis-
tency of the canonical formalism, let us strip the problem down to bare essentials, 
and consider a classical system with two coordinates a and b, which are like iv* 
and  'p.  Take the Lagrangian to be 
L(a, b, b) = ab  — V(a, b) 
The canonical rule says that a has no canonical conjugate. It is the conjugate to b. 
Show that this is completely consistent with the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian equa-
tions of motion, and thus it is thus completely consistent to quantize the system by 
imposing [a, NI =

The symmetric appearance of these equations is sometimes convenient; but it ac-
tually obscures the physics. These equations seem to indicate that there are four 
independent propagating modes; but actually there only two — the transverse com-
ponents of A. This can be shown by going to Coulomb gauge. 
In Coulomb gauge (or radiation gauge,) A is purely transverse:

Covariance of the Classical Theory 
We postulate that the potentials form a 4-vector 
--= (0, A)

mation. Since we always impose a gauge condition, a Lorentz transformation must 
be accompanied by a gauge transformation

In this gauge, however, the physical degrees of freedom are not manifest. 
In the Coulomb gauge, where physical degree freedom are made explicit, the 
equations of motion (5.9) are not manifestly covariant; but they actually are, be-
cause there always exists a gauge transformation to maintain the appearance of the

equations in all Lorentz frames. One has to choose between manifest covariance 
with Lorentz gauge, or manifest transversality with Coulomb gauge, and we choose 
the latter.

The Lagrangian density of the free electromagnetic field is

(

(5.25) 
Apart from an overall factor, this is uniquely determined by the requirement that it 
be Lorentz and gauge invariant, and does not contain higher derivatives of At than 
first derivatives. The minus sign in front is chosen to give a positive energy density 
for the free field, and the factor 1/4 sets the normalization of the fields. To obtain 
the equations of motion from the action principle, we must use the potential AV as 
the field variable. The Lagrangian density then reads

which vanishes identically for y = 0, indicating that A°  is not a dynamical variable. 
The dynamical fields are Ak, with canonical conjugate — F°k  = Ek. However, the 
longitudinal part of A has no physical significance, because it can be changed at 
will through a gauge transformation. (See Table 5.1.) The only dynamical degrees 
of freedom are the two transverse components of A, and we can go to Coulomb 
gauge to make this explicit. In Coulomb gauge A° satisfies the Poisson equation, 
and is determined by the external charges.

Quantization in Coulomb Gauge 
To quantize the electromagnetic field, we must first eliminate all unphysical de-
grees of freedom by fixing the gauge, and in the following we shall use Coulomb 
gauge. In the absence of external charges, we can set A° = 0, and write the Hamil-
tonian in the form 
1 
H = —2 f d 3 r(E2  + IV x Al 2) (V • A = 0) 
(5.44) 
The canonical conjugate to A is —E = aAla t, and we would normally impose the 
equal-time commutation relation [Ei (r, t), Ak 
= i 
k (5 3 (r — rI). But this is 
incorrect here, because the right side is not consistent with V • A = 0, nor with 
one of Maxwell's equations V • E = 0. We therefore replace di  k (5 3 (r — r') by its 
transverse projection, and take: 
flu (r, t), Ak  (11 , t) 
ic5 j  k
7: (r — r') 
(5.45)

where  e (k) is a unit polarization vector normal to k. For each k, there are two in-
dependent polarization vectors c i (k) and 6 2 (k), and E i (k), c 2 (k), k together form a 
right-handed coordinate system: 
k • E (k) = k.6 2 (k) = 0 
E s  (k) • E r  (k) = 5 sr 
 
E 1 (k) x c 2 (k) = klIkl 	
(5.48) 
Having chosen E i (k), 6 2 (k), there is still arbitrariness in the choice of c i (—k), 
E2(—k). By convention, we choose 
El (—k) = E l  (k) 
E2(—k) = —E 2 (k) 	
(5.49) 
as illustrated in Figure 5.1.

The commutation relations (5.45) are satisfied by imposing the commutation rela-
tions 
_a s  (k), a(p) = ôsrôkp  
[a (k), ar(p)] = 0 	
(5.52) 
where a s  (k) is the annihilation operator of a photon — a field quantum of momen-
tum k and linear polarization s. In the free-field case, the time dependent operator 
Aj (r, t) is simply obtained by replacing (k r) by (k . r—w kt) in the exponents in 
(5.51), because

The Hamiltonian and total momentum operator of the electromagnetic field are

These equations show that photons are boson with energy-momentum relation 
(1) k = IN. The vacuum state 10) is the state with no photons. All other states of the 
system can be generated by applying creation operators repeatedly to the vacuum 
state 
In the limit Q 	
co, the expansion (5.51) becomes a Fourier integral: 
where we write E (k, s) = E s  (k) for consistency in notation. The continuum form of 
the annihilation operator is 
a(k, s) = ALQ a,(k) 	
(5.56) 
which obeys the commutation relations 
a(k, s), at  (k', s')] = (2,7)3  ss, (5 3  (k — le) 	
(5.57) 
The Hamiltonian and total momentum now take the forms 

5 Electromagnetic Field 
5.5 
Spin Angular Momentum 
According to (5.43), the angular momentum density is 
u =  r x [E x (V x A)] 	
(5.59) 
We define the spin density to be the part that is independent of the origin of r. To 
find it, let us first rewrite the above in component form: 
ui = 
jk e kl 
mnq x  j Elan A q 
Now combine the last two c symbols according to the rule 
E klm E nqm 	
A A 
= tiknk-qq — 6 kOln 
We then obtain 
= c ii k (xi Eqak Aq — x 1  Enan A k ) 
e i jk [x  j Eqak Aq a n (x  j En Ak ) x j (anr)A k ± En Ak 
(5.60) 
(5.61) 
(5.62) 
The factor xi in the first term cannot be remove by manipulations involving ak , 
because j k. The second term is a total 3-divergence, and can be ignored. The 
third term vanishes because V • E = 0. The last term is independent of r, and 
identified as the spin density: 
s=ExA 	
(5.63) 
This is the spatial part of the tensor 
sPev 	
A al'"orfi 	
(5.64) 
where TI2v  is the spin matrix given in (3.52). The spin angular momentum is given 
by 
S = f d3 rE x A 	
(5.65) 
Using the expansion (5.51), we obtain 
s=iLk 
2 (k) 1  al  (k) — al (k) a2 (k)] 	
(5.66) 
where  Ic = k/lki. To diagonalize this, we make a linear transform to circularly 
polarized photons. 
The polarization vectors for circularly polarized photons are

5.6 Intrinsic Parity I 79 
where the label k has been suppressed. As one can easily verify, the plane wave 
Re [c 
ei_(k tY 
(5.68) 
represents a traveling wave whose polarization vector rotates in a right-handed 
sense about k. This is called a left-circularly polarized wave, because an observer 
facing the incoming wave would see the polarization rotating to the left. Similarly, 
E_  corresponds to a right-circularly polarized wave. The annihilation operators for 
circularly polarized photons are given by 
Left-circularly polarized: 	
a±(k) = 	
a i (k) — ia 2 (k)] 
Right-circularly polarized: 	
a_ (k) = —
1 	
i (k)

(5.69) 
2 
The commutation relations are 
[a± (k), a±
1 (p)] = 6kp 
[a+ (k), a_ (p)] = [a+ (k), a_ I (p)] = 0 	
(5.70) 
In terms of these, the spin operator becomes diagonal: 
S = 	
[a+(k)i a+ (k) — 	
(k) a_ (k)] 	
(5.71) 
This shows that the photon has spin 1, but there are only two helicity states. The 
helicity +1 corresponds to left-circular polarization, and —1 corresponds to right-
circular polarization: 
a ± (k) annihilates helicity state ± 1 	
(5.72) 
In terms of circular polarization, the field operator has the expansion

(5.76) 
j =1 
where AI (r) =  A1  (r, 0). For spatial reflection r' = —r we denote the unitary trans-
formation by?:  
PAk (r)P-1  = —Ac(—r) 	
(5.77) 
This establishes the fact that the electromagnetic field has odd intrinsic parity. 
To investigate how photon states transform, we substitute into the above the 
expansion (5.51). Using the abbreviation 
2  
a(k) =»s(k)as(k) 	
(5.78) 
s=1 
we have

PA(r)7) -1  =   
 [Pa(k)P- 1 e ilc.r

,‘/2W k

where the last relation is obtained by changing the summation variable from k to 
—k. Thus, 
'Pa(k)P-1 = —a(—k) 	
(5.80) 
which gives 
Pa 1 (k)7 -1  = —ai (—k) 
Pa2(k)P-1  = a2 (—k) 	
(5.81) 
In terms of circular polarization,

(5.82) 
A one-photon state of momentum k, linear polarization s, is defined by

(5.86) 
Thus, under spatial reflection, left and right are interchanged, and the state vector 
changes sign. 
5.7 
Transverse Propagator 
We now calculate the photon propagator in Coulomb gauge: 
(x) =  —i(01TA'(x)AJ (0)10) 	
(5.87) 
where the subscript T reminds us that the field is transverse:  8k A/ =--- 0. Expanding 
the field in creation and annihilation operators, we have 
(X) = 
f d 3 kd 3 k'

where

w = lc() 	
(5.89) 
and we use the abbreviation 
ct i (k, s)

(5.90) 
The vacuum expectation values are easily calculated: 
(01 a' (k, s)a)

(5.95) 
This is not Lorentz covariant, for it is in Coulomb gauge. To prove that the quan-
tized field theory is covariant, we should exhibit the gauge transformation that will 
maintain the form of the transverse propagator under Lorentz transformations. 
However, this is unnecessary, as we shall show in Chapter 11. The points is that 
non-covariant part of the propagator is physically irrelevant, because, owing to cur-
rent conservation, it does not contribute to the scattering amplitude. 
5.8 
Vacuum Fluctuations 
The vacuum state is neither an eigenstate of E nor B, since these operators annihi-
late or create photons singly. Although the fields average to zero, their mean-square 
fluctuations are large. This can be shown via direct calculation, but we can also 
demonstrate it through the following argument. The energy density in the vacuum 
state is 
(01E 2  +B2 10) = (01 E2 10) 	
(5.96) 
for the free field theory is invariant under the duality transformation. Equating this 
with the zero-point energy per unit volume in (5.54), we have 
1

(01E2 10) =

(2703  f d3 k1k

(5.97) 
which diverges due to the short-wavelength modes. This divergence is harmless, 
since only energy differences have physical significance; but the long-wavelength 
part of the fluctuations give rise to observable effects, including the Casimir ef-
fect. 
We illustrate the essence of the Casimir effect in a simple one-dimensional ex-
ample, leaving for the next section a more detailed treatment. Consider the modes

where we have introduced a cutoff function f(w), with the properties 
f(0) = 1 
f(co) --> 0 
(0--->co 
(5.98) 
(5.99) 
There is a cutoff frequency (p c , above which f(co) decreases rapidly to zero, and we 
take the limit co, 
oc  eventually. Suppose a partition is inserted, such that normal 
modes are required to have a node at the wall. The modes near the cutoff frequency 
are hardly affected, because their wavelengths are vanishingly small. Therefore, 
there are now fewer normal modes below the cutoff, as illustrated in Figure 5.2, 
and the zero-point energy decreases. 
Now insert two partitions into the box, separated by a distance a << L. As a de-
creases, an increasing number of modes are suppressed, and thus the zero-point 
energy decreases. This gives rise to an attractive force between the partitions, and 
the question is whether this force is independent of the cutoff frequency. For defi-
niteness choose the cutoff function to be

The Casimir Effect 
We now calculate the force between two metallic plates in the electrodynamic vac-
uum. The first task is to obtain the normal modes of the electromagnetic field in 
a perfectly conducting box of size axbx c. We choose one corner of the box as 
origin, and use Coulomb gauge. On each face of the box, the boundary condition is 
Ell = 0 Bi_ = 0 	
(5.104) 
where the subscripts II and I denote respectively the tangential and normal com-
ponents. We put B = V x A, E = —A, to obtain 
A11 --,-- 0 (V x A)" ---= 0 	
(5.105) 
On the y-z plane, for example, the boundary conditions are 
A y  -=-- A, = 0 a y A z  — az A y  ----= 0 
The first says that A is normal to the surface, and therefore the second condition is 
automatically satisfied. We must, however, satisfy the gauge condition 
8,A, + ay A y  + az A z  _ o 	
(5.106)

which leads to 
ax  A x  = 0 	
(5.107) 
Thus, the boundary conditions in Coulomb gauge are

For  A,  for example, the conditions are

A x (x, y,0) = A x (x, y, a) = 0 
A x (x,y, 0) =- A x (x , y, c) = 0 	
(5.109) 
A complete set of solutions to the wave equation is given by 
A, = cos(k,x) sin(k y y)sin(k,z) 
A y  = sin(k,x)cos(k y y)sin(k,z) 
A z  = sin(k,x) sin(k y  y)cos(kzz) 	
(5.110) 
where

k y  = 7rn y /b k, = rrrnz /c 
with ni = 1, 2, ... , oo. The frequency is given by 
k 	
+  k  +  k 	
(5.112) 
If all three components of k are nonzero, there are two independent solutions cor-
responding to the ± signs in  A. If any component of k vanishes, there is only one 
solution. For example, if k x  = 0, then A, = A, = 0, and the ± sign does not 
make any difference. We can now obtain the zero-point energy:

Consider now a large cubicle box of edge L, which is divided into 3 compartments

axis, separated by a distance a, symmetrical about the midpoint. The zero-point 
energy is the sum of those of the compartments. That of the middle compartment,

5.10 
The Gauge Principle 
We now discuss how the electromagnetic field should be coupled to charged fields. 
A non-relativistic charged particle obeys the Schr6dinger equation 
[ 21m (v 
i eA) 2  + eq) 
(r , t) = —
a v(r, t) 
at 
(5.122) 
where A, 0 are the vector and scalar potentials of an external electromagnetic field, 
and e is the charge of the particle. We can derive the form of the interaction as 
follows. In the absence of external fields, the Schrbdinger equation is invariant 
under a global gauge transformation 
(r, t) —4- e —i w v(r, t) 	
(5.123) 
where co is an arbitrary real constant. The invariance depends on the fact that ai, lp 
and 
transform in the same manner as lp . If we make a local gauge transforma-
tion, with co dependent on r, t, these conditions will not hold, for we have 
aU 	
e 	
— 	
cow] 	
(5.124) 
To make the equation invariant, we must cancel the terms involving at,  w. This can 
done by introducing the fields AY = (A, 0) through the replacement 
88 
a + ieA" (x) 11)(x) 	
(5.125) 
The Schr6dinger equation is now invariant under the local gauge transformation 
(x) 	
A" (x) + B' 1
(x) 
Ip(x) --> exp[—iez(x)]p(x) 	
(5.126) 
The quantity 
DP/p(x) =[aP + ieA" (x)] 
(x) 	
(5.127) 
is called the covariant derivative, and Af1  is called the gauge field, and the recipe to 
replace a- by DP is called the gauge principle. 
Actually, the gauge principle works only for a fully relativistic theory. For the 
non-relativistic Schr6dinger equation, it fails to produce magnetic moment terms 
of the form —p • V x A, which has to be put in by hand, with p arbitrary. In the 
relativistic Dirac equation discussed in the next chapter, the gauge principle gives 
the full electromagnetic interaction of the electron, with a completely determined 
magnetic moment. 
As a relativistic example, consider the complex scalar field with Lagrangian den-
sity

where w is a constant; but it is not invariant when w depends on x. To extend the 
symmetry to local gauge invariance, we make the replacement

where e is the electric charge. The Lagrangian density is generalized to

Problem 5.5 Two-Photon States [5] 
We can obtain interesting information about a state of two photons by examining 
its behavior under rotations and reflection. Consider two photons with momenta 
k and —k. There are 4 independent states of polarization, which can be classified 
according to circular polarizations:

From this, note that the polarization of the two photons are correlated: 
• in the state 1+ +) + 1— —) the planes are parallel; 
• in the state 1+ +)-1--) the planes are orthogonal; 
O in the states 1+—)  and 1—+), the planes have equal probability of being par-
allel or orthogonal. 
b) Work out the transformation laws for the 4 polarization states under R,  ,  P,  
using results of the last problem, and the fact that the vacuum state is invariant. 
Verify the results are summarized in the table of eigenvalues (listed whenever 
the state in question is an eigenstate of the operation indicated):

c) From the table above, verify the following quantum numbers for a two-photon 
state: 
* The only state with odd parity is I++)—I--).  There are 3 states with even 
parity: 1+ +)+1--),  1+—),  and 1—+). 
•
For odd total angular momentum J = 1, 3, 5, • • • , the only possible states 
are  1+—)  and 1— +). The reason is as follows: The other two states are both 
eigenstates of R and 
with eigenvalue 1. However, an eigenstate of R with 
eigenvalue 1 must have the rotation properties of the spherical harmonic yy, 
and therefore changes sign under 
for J = 1, 3, 5, • • • . 
O For total angular momentum J = 0, 1, the only possible states are 
1+ +) + 1--) and 1++)-1--), because the other two states have spin pro-
jections ±2 along the z-axis, values that are too large for J = 0, 1. 
d) Verify that a two-photon state cannot have J = 1. This gives Yang's selection 
rule [6]: A spin 1 particle cannot decay into two photons. For example, since the 7r0  
meson decays into two photons, we know that its spin cannot be 1. (It is in fact 
a spin 0 particle.) 
Problem 5.6 Dirac Monopole 
A magnetic monopole has a magnetic field B pole —  g17 r2 , with total magnetic flux 
4,7g. This makes V • Bpoie  O. We can reconcile this with Maxwell's equation 
V • B = 0 by postulating a returning flux —47rg concentrated in a "string" — an 
infinitely narrow flux tube. The vector potential then consists of a part due to the

monopole, and a part due to the string:

straight-line string leading from the monopole to infinity, show that the vector 
potential of the string is of the pure-gauge form 
Astring  = —2gVya 
where ça is the azimuthal angle around the string. 
c) Consider a quantum-mechanical particle of electric charge e in the field of the 
monopole, with wave function p.  Show that the string can be transformed away

d) Since 7p has to be single-value, the coefficient of ()a in the exponent must be an 
integer n, and thus 
ge = n/2 
This is the Dirac quantization condition. The mere possibility that a monopole 
can exist quantizes the electric charge. 
e) Show that the total angular momentum of the system consisting of a charge e 
and a monopole g points from the charge to the monopole, and has the mag-

Dirac Ecpation 
6.1 
Dirac Algebra 
A relativistic wave equation must treat space and time on the same footing. The 
Klein—Gordon equation does that, but it involves second time derivatives, a fea-
ture responsible for its failure as a one-particle equation. Dirac tries to remedy this 
by proposing a first-order differential equation. To obtain a equation for the wave 
function //) that is linear in the space-time derivatives a/t ip , Dirac writes 
(iy ,"611  — m) 7,0(x) = 0 	
(6.1) 
where the r" are numerical coefficients, so far undetermined. To satisfy the rela-
tivistic kinematics, V)(x) must also satisfy the Klein—Gordon equation. Multiplying 
from the left by (i yi` a + m), we have

According to (6.4) yUy '' should be a hermitian matrix. Thus y' is either hermi-
tian or antihermitian. Putting y

This condition immediately rules out matrices of odd dimension. It also rules out 
dimension 2, for there are only 3 independent traceless 2 x 2 matrices — the Pauli 
matrices. Therefore, the dimension must be at least 4. That a 4 x 4 representation 
exists can be shown by explicit construction. 
Define the following 4 x 4 hermitian matrices:

We shall not use different notations for 2 x 2 and 4 x 4 matrices, since the context 
usually makes the meaning clear. It follows from the definitions that

(6.26) 
The hermitian conjugate of (6.1) reads 
[a

(6.27) 
Now write lpt  =  y ° ,  and use y ° y 	
° = yP to obtain the equation for the Pauli 
adjoint: 
(84)iyft + my) = 0 	
(6.28) 
Another way of writing this is 
Ip(irut, + rn) = 0 	
(6.29) 
where the overhead arrow on a indicates that it acts to the left. 
The conserved current density is given by 
1PYP/P

The current jP can therefore serve as a particle current density. As we shall see, 
however, the Dirac equation fails to qualify as a single-particle equation for a differ-
ent reason, namely the energy spectrum is not bounded from below. The remedy is 
a redefinition of the vacuum state known as "hole theory", which makes the system 
a many-particle system. With this modification, j °  is no longer positive definite, 
but can be interpreted as a charge density.

For given momentum, there are two roots for the energy p ° , with opposite signs: 
Po = ±E 
where E is defined as the positive quantity 
E =

The Dirac equation now takes the form 
(0 — m)u(p)  =0  
where 0 is a 4 x 4 matrix defined by

It has the property

and 2 of (6.42) for p °  = E, and columns 3 and 4 for p °  = —E. We designate them 
as u(p, s). The explicit solutions for p° = E are

For a given energy, the wave functions above resemble those of a non-relativistic 
particle of spin 1/2, and it is natural to regard s as a spin label. We shall see that 
this is a correct interpretation. 
Taking the hermitian conjugate of the equation (6.38), we have 
u (p, s)(0 1  — m) = 0 	
(6.48) 
Multiplying the equation from the right by y °, and using the identity

we find the Pauli-adjoint equation

Note that y'1  remains unchanged, because it is just a numerical matrix. We relate 
the new wave function to the old through a linear unitary transformation: 
10x') = S(x) 	
st s = 1 	
(6.55) 
where S is a non-singular 4 x 4 unitary matrix. To demonstrate Lorentz covariance, 
we shall show that there exists a non-singular transformation on y 11  that will re-
store the Dirac equation to the old form. Putting aft, = A a, and multiplying the 
equation by S -1  from the left, we obtain 
S -1 (iy/tA8, — m)S1p(x) = 0 
which reduces to the original equation if  (S1 y " 	
= y 'or 
S —l eS = 	
(6.56) 
The existence of S will be demonstrated by explicit construction. 
It suffices to consider an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation

We put 
(6.58) 
S = 1 + R 	
(6.59) 
where R is an infinitesimal hermitian matrix linear in co,. To first order in 04 the 
condition for covariance is 
w;yft  = i[y", R] 	
(6.60) 
We can write R as a linear combination of the T, of Table 6.1, whose commutators 
are listed in Table 6.2. As we can see, only cr4  can contribute to R. Thus R must 
have the form R = C co it ,,a,"", and a short calculation determines C = —1/4. 
Therefore 
S = 1 —

This demonstrates the Lorentz covariance of the Dirac equation. Comparison with 
(3.52) shows that the spin operator is

A finite rotation about a given axis can be build up from successive infinitesimal 
rotations about the same axis: 
S = e i0.612  = cos —2 + iê o-  sin —2 	
(6.64) 
where 0 is a vector whose direction is the axis of rotation, and whose magnitude 
is the angle of rotation. Similarly, for a Lorentz boost of the reference frame with 
finite velocity y corresponds to

6 Dirac Equation 
The advantage of using 0 is that, unlike v, it is additive for successive boosts. We 
note that S is unitary for rotations, but not for Lorentz boosts. 
The Dirac equation realizes a finite-dimensional representation of the Lorentz 
group. As we have seen in Chapter 3, the smallest faithful representation of the 
Lorentz group is of dimension 2. Here the dimension is doubled in order to repre-
sent spatial reflections. 
Consider the total reflection of the spatial coordinate system

In the transformed frame, the Dirac equation reads

axk 
which exhibits covariance if there exist S that commutes with y °, anticommutes 
with y k , with S 2  = 1. An obvious choice is 
S = y °  (Spatial reflection) 	
(6.68) 
which shows the necessity for 4 x 4 matrices. 
For total space-time reflection x' = —x, we have 
(—iraa,„ —  m)'(—x)  = 0 
with complex conjugate 
— m)0/*(—x) = 0 
Accordingly we put 
= S0*(x) 
To restore the original equation, we seek S that anticommutes with ru, with S 2  = 
1, and an obvious solution is 
S = y 5  (Space-time reflection) 	
(6.69) 
For time reversal, which is the product of space-time reflection with spatial reflec-
tion, we have 
S = y ° y 5  (Time-reversal)

This is an algebraic transformation that preserves the form of the Dirac equation 
when t is replaced by —t; but it is not the operation that governs physical states, 
which must be taken as states in quantum field theory. In the next chapter, we 
shall see that physical time reversal must involve complex conjugation of the state. 
For a plane-wave state we have 
(x) = e—i "u(p, s) 
(x') 	
Di! (pf  , s') 	
(6.71) 
where p' is the 4-momentum with respect to the new frame, and s' labels the new 
solutions. Since p • x is invariant, we have 
ut (pl , s') = S u(p, s) 
a/(p', s') = a(p, s) S 	
(6.72) 
In general, we can reshuffle the 4 solutions in the new frame; but since a Lorentz 
transformation preserves the sign of the energy, the mixing of solutions can only 
occur among s = 1, 2, and separately among s = 3, 4. With this freedom under-
stood, we set .5' = s by convention. It is straightforward to show (Problem 6.2) 
Y cl u(-13,

(s =  1,2)  
u(p, s) 
(s =  3,4)  
(6.73) 
which indicates that positive-energy and negative-energy states have opposite  pari-
ty.  
We see from (6.72) that au is invariant under a Lorentz transformation, and 
ay ," u transforms like a 4-vector. More generally, the transformation properties of 
aT ," u are listed in Table 6.3.

Interpretation of Dirac Matrices 
The Dirac matrices ak  are velocity components in the sense 
d dt = i[H, x k 1  = 	
(6.74) 

6 Dirac Equation 
Individually, each component has eigenvalues +1, but the components do not com-
mute with one another. This conjures up the picture that the electron performs a 
curious dance at the speed of light about its average motion called the zitterbewe-
gung. But this motion is not directly observable. (See Problem 6.5.) Expectation 
values of the Dirac matrices, on the other hand, have physical significance. 
Let I E) be a normalized eigenstate of energy: 
HIE) = EIE) 
(RIE)  = 1 	
(6.75) 
We have the trivial identity 
(El(HO — OH)IE) = 0 	
(6.76) 
which can be rewritten in the form 
(El(HO +  OH — 20 H)I E) = 0 	
(6.77) 
This gives 
1  
(0) = 2E ({H, O}) 
where (0)  =( E I 01 E) / (E I E). Choosing for O the Dirac matrix fi, we find 
m 
(fi) = 7 = -\/ 1  - v 2  
As we have seen, a is the velocity. Hence the magnetic moment is 
e 
p = -I' X a 
2 
(6.78) 
(6.79) 
(6.80) 
where e is the electric charge. Now put 0 = It in (6.78). A straightforward calcula-
tion gives 
(p) .= —
e (L + 2S) 
2E 
(6.81) 
where L = r x p is the orbital angular momentum, and S = aI2 is the spin 
operator. This show that the gyromagnetic ratio associated with the intrinsic spin 
is 2, but that associated with orbital motion, as in spin-orbit coupling, is 1. We shall 
verify these properties, and give physical interpretations.

where E and B are respectively the external electric and magnetic fields. The first 
equation is the analog of the Lorentz-force equation, and the second describes spin 
precession. Taking the dot product of the second equation with a, we have 
2a•a-xa= 2Jr  x :r a 	
(6.87) 
Noting that 
axa- =—e(Axp+pxA) =—ieB 
we can write

Combining this with the equation for daldt, we obtain

In arriving at this equation, we used the identity ux a = 2ia, which can be obtain 
from ux  u  = 2i o-  by observing that a = y 5 0-. 
The equations (6.89) and (6.90) have interesting physical consequences [1]. For

Suppose a longitudinally polarized particle moves along the z axis, loses energy, 
and stops. This equation says duz /d t = 0, or that the particle is not depolarized. 
This result is crucial to the interpretation of the classic experiment [2] that estab-
lished parity violation in the decay process yr–  y –  f). The y-mesons were 
observed after being stopped in matter, and found to be longitudinally polarized. 
The above result shows that they had the same longitudinal polarization at the mo-
ment of decay. 
6.7 
Non-Relativistic Limit 
We shall study the non-relativistic limit of (6.82) by first putting it in second-order 
form. Multiplying it from the left by i y "D i, 
m, we obtain 
()iv D„D ± m2) V = 0 	
(6.93) 
Writing the first term as half the symmetric part plus the antisymmetric part with 
respect to the labels y and y, we can show

y "[D„, D„] 	
(6.94) 
A straightforward calculation gives

We thus arrive at the second-order equation

(6.97) 
where we have used the relation

The equation displays a magnetic-moment term u • B, with electric-moment term

(E —

Solving for the "small" component we have 
u • (p — eA)z 
E — e0 4- m 
which shows that it is of order Ipl / E compared to the "large" component z. 
The second-order equation can be rewritten in the block form

(6.103) 
which is an exact equation. We go to the non-relativistic limit by putting 
E = m E (6.104) 
and assume c <.< m and e0 << m. Keeping only terms to first-order in c and es 75, 
we obtain

This has the form of a Schrbdinger equation except for the non-hermitian iE • 
term, which reflects the fact that ztz is not conserved, due to the existence of 
negative-energy states. A one-particle interpretation is consistent only when this 
term can be neglected. 
The magnetic-moment term has the form 
2m  u B = — —e S • B 
(6.106) 
where S = u/2 is the spin operator. The coefficient of the magnetic field gives the 
magnetic moment:

the anomalous magnetic moment, due to vacuum fluctuations of the quantum 
fields.

preted as the energy —p' • B' of a magnetic moment p' in the magnetic field 
B' = E x y = —r x 02- 
r 
where v = p/ m. This gives 
(6.112) 
it' = g' (e 12m)S 	
(6.113) 
with 
g' = 1 	
(6.114) 
which is in agreement with experiments on the fine structure of atomic spectral 
lines. 
6.8 
Thomas Precession 
The electron exhibits two different gyromagnetic ratios: g = 2 with respect to an 
external magnetic field, and g' = 1 with respect to a magnetic field generated by 
its orbital motion in a central electrostatic potential. To understand these results, 
consider first an electron in an external magnetic field B. It moves in a circular 
orbit with the cyclotron frequency 
110  
W cydotron = (el rn)B 
(6.115) 

6.8 Thomas Precession 
111 
The spin precesses about the magnetic field according to the equation dpldt = 
x B. With p = gS, this gives a precession frequency 
CO precession  = ( e /2 in)gB 	
(6.116) 
Thus 
CO precession — CO cyclotron = ( e / 2 m)(g — 2)B 	
(6.117) 
If g =- 2, as implied by the Dirac equation, the orbital motion and the spin preces-
sion are synchronized, as stated previously in (6.91). In reality g deviates slightly 
from 2, due to vacuum fluctuations, and g — 2 can be measured to very high accu-
racy by observing the slippage between orbital motion and spin precession. 
Consider now an electron moving in an electrostatic potential in a circular orbit. 
In the frame co-moving with the electron, there is a magnetic field B', about which 
the spin precesses with frequency 
Wrest = (e/2m)gB' 	
(6.118) 
with g = 2. However, this is not the precession frequency observed in the labo-
ratory frame, due to the Thomas precession. This arises because the electron frame 
has a precession relative to the lab frame, due to the non-additivity of velocities 
in successive Lorentz transformations. To see this, make a Lorentz transformation 
from the laboratory frame, (which is presumed to be an inertial frame), to the in-
stantaneous rest frame of the electron at time t. The orbital velocity y being small 
in the non-relativistic limit, the electron spinor undergoes an infinitesimal Lorentz 
transformation 
1 
=- 1 — —2 a • y 	
(6.119) 
At time t dt, the velocity becomes y ± ad t, where a is the instantaneous acceler-
ation, and we make a successive Lorentz transformation 
S2 = 1 — —
1 a • ad t

Over the time interval d t, we have made the overall transformation

(6.120)

with last term causing the non-additivity of velocities. Now use the identity 
(a 	
B) = (a.  • AO • B) = A • B 
ia •AxB 	
(6.122) 
and write 
(a • a)(a • y)dt = ia • a x ydt 	
(6.123)

As illustrated in Figure 6.1, its sense is opposite to that of W rest , and the magnitude

(6.126) 
The spin precession frequency in the lab frame is therefore 
Wlab = Wrest — WT = (e/2 m)(g -1)B' 	
(6.127) 
which leads to the result g' = g —1 = 1. 
6.9 
Hole Theory 
The energy spectrum of the Dirac equation consists of a positive continuum ex-
tending from m to oo, and a negative continuum from —m to  —oc. The negative-
energy levels cannot be ignored, because it is required by relativistic kinematics. 
Their existence destabilizes the theory, for, if there are any interactions at all, a 
particle can lose energy and fall down the bottomless pit of negative-energy states. 
Thus, no stable particles of positive energy can exist. 
Imagine that the negative spectrum is cut off at some large but finite depth. If 
the particles obey Fermi statistics, the avalanche will stop when all negative-energy 
level are filled with two particles (of opposite spin.) The filled "negative-energy sea" 
will be the state of lowest energy — the vacuum state. Removing a particle in this 
sea will create a hole that appears as an "antiparticle", in the sense that it can be

annihilated with a particle falling into the hole. Redefining the vacuum state in this 
manner results in "hole theory", as illustrated in Figure 6.2. This redefinition of 
the vacuum state stabilizes the theory, and the important points are that 
• it is possible only if spin 1/2 particles obey Fermi statistics; 
• it makes the system into a many-particle system — a quantized field. 
In hole theory, the absence of a negative-energy particle corresponds to the pres-
ence of an antiparticle with positive energy. This is expressed through the fact that 
the wave function of an antiparticle of energy E and momentum p is the complex 
conjugate of that of a particle of energy —E and momentum —p. Accordingly, we 
shall redefine the solutions to the Dirac equation by reversing the momentum for 
negative-energy states. Let the positive-energy solutions be redesignated u+ (p, 1), 
u + (p, 2), and the negative-energy solutions u_ (p, 1), u_ (p, 2). We choose as a com-
plete set the following: 
u(p, s) = Co  u + (p, s) 
v(p, s) = Co  u_(—p, s) 
(6.128) 
where 
Co = V(in

They satisfy the equations

In the above equations, pa is defined such that p° > 0:

(—a • p

(6.133) 
Note that the energy of v(p, s) is still negative, for all we did was to reverse the 
momentum, and write its energy as —E (with E > O.) 
The orthonormality of the solutions is expressed by the relations 
114 
4(p, s)u(p, s') = ass,  
ij(p, s)v(p, s') = — ass,  
s)u(p, s') -= 0

which are equivalent to

ut (p, s)v(—p, s') = 0

They have the properties 
[A ±(P)

A + (p) 	
_ (p) = 1 	
(6.139) 
Note that the 4-vector pP in p is defined to have positive time component p °  = E. 
The Dirac equation cannot be a one-particle equation, but it furnishes a finite-
dimensional representation of the full Lorentz group. As such, it provides a com-
plete set of one-particle wave functions, in terms of which we can analyze the oper-
ator of a spin 1/2 field, as we shall do in the next chapter. 
6.10 
Charge Conjugation 
An antiparticle should have opposite charge to a particle, since it represents the 
absence of a particle in the negative-energy sea. This is intuitively obvious; but let 
us make certain that the formalism gives this result. In the presence of an exter-
nal electromagnetic field AP (x) the Dirac equation is given by (6.82). We denote 
the wave function as ?p (x) for positive-energy plane wave states, and  p`(x) for 
negative-energy plane-wave states: 
11) (x) 	
e —i Et+ ip.x u(p, s)  
(x) 	
e iEt—ip.x v (p, s ) 
(6.140) 
where E = + Vp2  + m2 . Then (6.82) can be rewritten 
i eA — 	
11)(x) = 0 
— 	
— m]lp c(x) = 0 
(6.141) 
which show that the charge indeed has opposite signs for particle and antiparticle. 
The two equations above can be transformed into each other through "charge con-
jugation", or "particle-antiparticle conjugation". To change the sign of the coupling 
term in the first equation, we take the complex conjugate: 
[—iy*P(a 
- ieA p ) — m] tp*(x) = 0 	
(6.142) 
We then make a unitary transformation to bring it to the form of the second equa-
tion. Thus, 
Tpc(x) = ipp*(x) 	
(6.143) 
where )7 is a 4 x 4 matrix with the properties 
)7 2 = 1 	
(6.144) 
= -y" 

116 I 6 Dirac Equation 
The solution is, in our standard representation of the Dirac matrices, 
y  2 	
(6.145) 
(where y 2  is the second Dirac matrix.) In terms of the spinors, charge conjugation 
corresponds to the transformation 
v (p, s) =  17 u* (p, s) 	
(6.146) 
Since {y 2 ,  y = O. this shows that particles and antiparticles have opposite parity. 
Like the time reversal discussed earlier, the charge conjugation here is an op-
eration on Dirac wave functions, and not on physical states, which are defined in 
quantum field theory. They are relevant because we expand the quantum field op-
erators in terms of Dirac wave functions.

For a massless Dirac particle, with m = 0, the equation for the Dirac spinor reduces 
to Ou(p) = 0, or 
(a • p) u(p) = po u(p) 	
(6.147) 
where 
P0  =  ± E,  E 	
II 	
(6.148) 
Since [a ',  y5] = 0, we can diagonalize y 5 , whose eigenvalue ±1 is called "chiral-
ity". The solution with chirality +1 is called "right-handed", denoted u (p, R); one 
with chirality —1 is called "left-handed", denoted u (p, L): 
y5 u(p, R) = u(p, R) 
y5 u(p, L) = —u(p, L) 
Using the relation 
Ys a = a 
we have 
(a • P) u(13) = 	
)15 U (P) 
(6.149) 
(6.150) 
(6.151) 
which states that the helicity (u •)  is the chirality times the sign of the energy. 
Thus, for R the helicity is has the same sign as  p ° ,  and for L it has the opposite 
sign. The helicity is not an independent variable for massless Dirac particles. We 
can classify the four independent spinors of given momentum p by chirality and

sign of energy: 
u+(p, 	
u_(p, 	
(6.152) 
where 
= R, L is the chirality, and ± refers to the sign of the energy. 
With the mass equal to zero, we cannot normalize the spinors according to 
ut u = E/ in, as we did in (6.135). Instead, we put 
-= ô
2E 	
(6.153) 
With this normalization, the one-particle states 1p) have the properties 
(pi lp) = 2 E(2.7) 3 6 3 (p — p') 
f  d 3  p 
(27)32E 11)41 = 1  
We note that the Pauli adjoint a is orthogonal to u: 
= 0 
(6.154) 
(6.155) 
This is because it has opposite chirality, owing to the relation { y 5 , y = 0, and is 
left as an exercise (Problem 6.7). 
We must of course define the vacuum using hole theory. In analogy with the 
massive case, we define antiparticle spinors 1), and use a new notation:

Problem 6.3 Pauli term 
The Dirac equation describes a particle with g = 2. Physical particles have g-factors 
different from 2 because of interactions, which give rise to an "anomalous" mag-
netic moment. The electron acquire the anomalous moment through interactions 
with the quantized electromagnetic field. That for the proton and neutron are dom-
inated by the strong interactions. Suppose the g-factor is 2 + K. Show that this can 
be accommodated by taking the Dirac equation in external electromagnetic field to 
be

The zitterbewegung is a kinematic property of the spin 1/2 representation of the 
Lorentz group, the "clockwork" of the Dirac equation. It refers to an unobservable

The last term is the zitterbewegung, which arises from an interference between 
positive- and negative-energy states. On dimensions grounds, we can conclude that 
the amplitude of this oscillatory motion is of the order of the Compton wavelength 
1/ m, and therefore unobservable. In the hole theory, when all negative energy state 
are filled, the zitterbewegung becomes part of the vacuum fluctuations of the Dirac 
field, for it can happen only when holes are momentarily created due to fluctua-
tions.

The Dirac Field 
7.1 
Quantization of the Dirac Field 
In hole theory, the Dirac equation describes a many-fermion system, and thus the 
Dirac "wave function" lp (x) should be regarded as a classical field to be quantized 
according to Fermi statistics. To carry out the quantization in the canonical formal-
ism, we take as classical Lagrangian density 
L(x) = V(x)(irua y  — rn)tp(x) 	
(7.1) 
where 7p (ac) is a 4-component spinor, and the independent field variables are the 
components v), (x). We note that L(x) is Lorentz invariant, and globally gauge 
invariant. This is a first-order Lagrangian density, involving first instead of sec-
ond derivatives with respect to time. We have illustrated the self-consistency of the 
canonical formalism in this case, in Problem 4.5. Therefore, following strict canon-
ical procedures, we calculate 
I 123 
The equation of motion is 
+ mV) = 	
(7.3) 
which correctly gives the Dirac equation in hermitian-conjugate form. The La-
grangian density vanishes for fields satisfying the equation of motion: 
G(x) = 0

(7.6) 
where a and b denote spinor indices. The anticommutators serve as initial condi-

7.1 Quantization of the  Dirac Field 
125 
From the angular momentum, we can read off the spin operator: 
z pv 	
2 	
(7.15) 
in agreement with what we found in the last chapter. 
The one-particle solutions obtained in the last chapter constitute a basis in terms 
of which the field operators may be expanded. We normalize the wave functions in 
a large periodic box of volume Q,  and write 
where 
Ep 	
1/p2 
rn2 
The factor VmlE p  appears because the Dirac spinors are normalized according to 
(6.134) and (6.135): 
1-4(p,  s) (p,  s') = (mlEp )ui (p, s)u(p, s') 
i3(p, s)v(p, s') = — (ml Ep )vi (p, s)v(p, s') = — (5ss' 
= 0 
With this factor taken out, we have simple anticommutation rules 
laps , apty l =  {bps, 	
6 ss'àppf 
(7.18) 
{aps ,

aps  >py = 0 	
(7.19) 
which lead to the interpretation that aps  annihilates a particle whose wave function 
is u(p, s), and b ps  annihilates an antiparticle whose wave function is  v 1  (p, s). 
Hole theory is implement through the statement 
ap5 10) = b p5 10) = 0 for all p, s 	
(7.20) 
That is, there are neither particles nor antiparticles in the vacuum state 10). In 
terms of the annihilation and creation operators we have 
H = 	
Ep  (a s aps  — bps b,) = 	
Ep  (a-pr s aps  + 
s bps

b ps ps)

(7.16) 
(7.17) 

7 The Dirac Field 
126 
If we had not used hole theory, b ps  would be a creation instead of annihilation 
operator, and bps  145  would have eigenvalues 0,1. Consequently, the Hamiltonian 
would not be bounded from below. The sign-reversal that makes the Hamiltoni-
an positive-definite, of course, depends on the fact that we quantized the system 
according to Fermi statistics. 
The charge operator is given by 
Q= f d 3 rïpy °V f d 3 rtp 
— 	
(ct;s  aps  — N;s bp, + 1) 	
(7.22) 
ps 
which shows that particles and antiparticles have opposite charge. The minus sign 
above arises through rewriting bps4s  as — b bp, + 1. This is dictated by the fact that 
s bps  has positive eigenvalues in holes theory. The normalization of Q is arbitrary, 
for the magnitude of the charge is determined only when there is interaction with 
the electromagnetic field. 
7.2 
Feynman Propagator 
The Feynman propagator for the Dirac field is a 4 x 4 matrix 
iS F(x) = (01TV (x)tp (0)I O) 
(7.23) 
where the time-ordering operator T is defined to include a sign change when two 
fermion operators A and B are interchanged: 
T[A( ti) B ( t2)] 
A(ti)B(t2) 	
if t 1  > t2  
—B(t 2)A(t i ) 
if t2  >  ti 
(7.24) 
The propagator can be calculated straightforwardly, using the expansions (7.16). 
Let x = (t, r). For t > 0, the only contribution comes from terms in the expansion 
of the form  caT :

This shows that the residue at the mass-shell pole at 13' = m2  contains the wave 
functions of an electron of momentum p, or those of a positron of momentum 
= —P. 
7.3 
Normal Ordering 
Both H and Q contain divergent contributions from the zero-point energy and 
charge of the vacuum state. These terms have no physical relevance since energy 
and charge are measured relative to those of the vacuum state. They can be elimi-
nated by redefining the reference points, and this can be achieved by arranging the 
order of operators appropriately. 
We first introduce the notion of normal ordering. Suppose 0 is a product of cre-
ation and annihilation operators. The corresponding normal product : 0 : is defined 
as that obtained from 0 by rearranging the order of the factors, if necessary, such 
that all creation operators stand to the left of all annihilation operators. In the rear-
rangement process, an interchange of two fermion operators gives rise to a factor 
— 1. As an example: 
•= 
ps  p s • 	
ps p s 
: a , at • -- —at a , 
p s 
ps  • 	
ps  p s 
Normal ordering can be naturally extended to a sum of products: 
: 	 +  02:=: 01  :+:  02:  
We now redefine the Hamiltonian and the current as 
H =: f d3  rzp (r, t)(—ict • V ± 	
(r, t) : 
j(x) =: 
 
(7.36) 
(7.37) 
(7.38) 
It is clear that these operators give zero when operating on the vacuum state, be-
cause annihilation operators stand to the far right. This is just a formal way of 
stating that the zero-point energy and currents are to be omitted. As the notation 
is somewhat cumbersome, we shall not explicit indicate normal ordering unless 
necessary. 
7.4 
Electromagnetic Interactions 
We consider systems of interacting fields with a Lagrangian density consisting of 
the sum of the free Lagrangian densities of the participating fields, plus an interac-
tion Lagrangian density that couple the fields together. This is not the most general 

7.5 lsospin 1 129 
case conceivable, but it is what we can handle mathematically. We illustrate the 
types of interactions commonly encountered. Consider a Dirac field, a complex 
scalar field, and the electromagnetic field, which have free Lagrangian densities 
given by

According to the gauge principle, the matter fields can be coupled to the electro-
magnetic by replacing ,9/1  by the covariant derivative 
= 	
+ iekt(x) 	
(7.40) 
where e is the electric charge. Assuming that both the Dirac field and the scalar 
field have the same charge e, the electrodynamic Lagrangian density is

(I)  
(7.41) 
(7.42) 
The matter fields are coupled through conserved currents, which are the Noether 
currents associated with global gauge invariance. For the scalar field, the current 
has an e2  term proportional to AP . This becomes a mass term for the photon when 
0* 0 develops a vacuum expectation value, in spontaneous symmetry breaking. 
(See Problem 15.5.) 
The electromagnetic field couples to all charged fields through the gauge princi-
ple, and is universal in this sense. The vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic 
field includes the momentary creation of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs and their 
subsequent annihilation. The temporary charge separation makes the vacuum into 
a dielectric-like medium, and all the charged fields of the world participate in this 
"vacuum polarization", their contributions being determined solely by charge and 
mass. 
7.5 
lsospin 
The Dirac field can be used in a phenomenological description of protons and neu- 
trons, which are really made of quarks. The effective theory is useful in describ- 
ing the "charge-independent" pion-nucleon interactions at low energies. It is based 

7 The Dirac Field 
130 
on the fact that proton and neutron are almost identical, and so are the three 7r 
mesons, and the strong nuclear forces respect the identities. By ignoring the elec-
tromagnetic and weak interactions, we can regard the proton and neutron as dif-
ferent state of a particle called the nucleon, and the 7r mesons as different states of 
the pion. 
The nucleon field is represented by a two-component Dirac field 
(x) = 	
) 	
(7.43) 
zP2(x)) 
where i = 1 corresponds to proton, and i = 2 to neutron. Each Tp i  is a 4- 
component Dirac spinor field. Writing out all the indices, we have 8 complex fields 
zpi a(x), with a = 1, • • • ,4  and i = 1, 2. By analogy with spin angular momen-
tum, we define the isospin Y/2 as generators of rotations in the two-dimensional 
internal space spanned by 
and 1p 2 :

+1/2 and —1/2: 
1p) = (1) 	
In) = (

(7.45) 
which can be created from the vacuum by applying v) (x). We use a shorthand 
notation in which the spinor and internal indices are suppressed. For example, 
7/-) 	
-rf = Via(ru)abMijVbj 	
(7.46) 
where a, b are sum from 1 to 4, and i, j are summed from 1 to 2. 
More generally we define isospin as an internal symmetry group whose genera-
tors I obey angular-momentum commutation relations (the Lie algebra): 
{Ik  Iii  = ic k`'n 1. . 
Thus one can simultaneously diagonalize  Y  = I(I + 1) and 13 , and denote isospin 
eigenstates by I I,  13 ). The nucleon belongs to the fundamental representation with 
I = 1/2, in which 7 = Y/2. The overhead arrow denotes a vector in isospin space, 
which has 3 components because that is the number of generators of the group. 
The pion field has I = 1, and is described by a 3-component real field 
( 
Ox) = 
0 2 (x) 
01(x)) 
(7.47) 
This the "adjoint representation" of the group, which has the same dimension as 
the number of generators, and in which the generators are represented by matrices 
T taken directly from the Lie algebra:

7.6 Parity 
Experimental evidence dictate that 0 (x) be pseudoscalar, i.e., it changes sign un-
der spatial reflection. We note that 13 is not diagonal. The physical pion fields, 
which are eigenstates of  i 3 ,  are related to 0 k through

(7.49) 
These operators create states with 1 3  = +1, —1, 0 respectively, when they operate 
on the vacuum state, 
Charge-independence in the pion-nucleon system means that the interaction 
conserves isospin. A Lorentz-invariant effective Lagrangian density, known as 
"pseudoscalar coupling", is given by 
L(x) = (ir"a  —M) + —21  aq; • 	
—  m 2
. .;b]+ g( t» ysi-  tp)j (7.50) 
The vector notation makes manifest the rotational invariance in isospin space. A 
competing model is the "pseudovector coupling" model, with

Some consequences of isospin invariance are explored in Problem 7.4.

Charge conjugation, or particle-antiparticle conjugation, is defined as a unitary op-
eration C on the Hilbert-space that interchanges particle and antiparticle, and re-
verses the sign of the electromagnetic field:

7.8 Time Reversal I 133 
The transformation of A°  (x) is not specified independently, because it in Coulomb 
gauge it is not an independent field. It is clear that 
(x) is invariant under this 
transformation, because the free fields Lagrangian densities are invariant, and the 
Dirac field is coupled to the electromagnetic field through the current density, 
which changes sign. 
To find how the Dirac field operator transforms, let us compare the following 
expansions: 
The expansion coefficients satisfy (6.146): 
v(p, s) = yu * (p, s) 
where y = 1/ 2  is a real 4 x 4 matrix. Therefore

(7.65) 
Note that the Dirac wave functions undergo complex conjugation, which is a non-
linear operation, because (.1u)* = /1* u*. The field operator, however, undergoes a 
linear transformation, because C(.11p)C -1  = AC lp C-1 . The difference can be traced 
to the fact that in the Dirac equation we have to change the sign of the coupling to 
an external electromagnetic field, whereas in the field theory, the electromagnetic 
field is part of the system, and automatically changes sign under charge conjuga-
tion. 
7.8 
Ti me Reversal 
Time reversal is the operation of interchanging past and future, represented by a 
operator T on Hilbert space. Suppose Vla  is a member of a complete set of states 
in Hilbert space, where a stands for quantum numbers, such as momentum p and 
helicity, i.e., spin projection s on the momentum vector. The operation T is defined 
by the following properties: 
TW a
Wã 
 = 
(TWa,TWb) = (Wb, WO 	
(7.66) 

134 I 7 The Dirac Field 
where a are the time-reversed quantum numbers: 
p = —p 
s = —s 	
(7.67) 
(Thus the helicity remains invariant.) Orthonormality of basis states is preserved: 
(n,via)= (TWa,T 114) = (Wb, Wa) 	
(7.68) 
The time reversal is not a linear operation. To see this, rewrite the last property 
in the form 
(TWa,"1- Wb) = (Wa, Wb) * 	
(7.69) 
Replacing Wb by .1 Wb, where is a complex number, we obtain 
W a , 	
gib)) ---= 2* (Wa, Wb) * 	
(7.70) 
Therefore 
T(AWb) = A*T
.Vb 	
(7.71) 
That is, when acting on a number, T takes its complex conjugate. This makes T 
nonlinear. Generally, the operation T consists of complex conjugation, followed by 
a unitary transformation: 
T = U* 
T-1  = U-1 * 
It is assumed that U commutes with complex conjugation. 
For the Schrbdinger equation 
= 	
 
at 
time reversal means 
(7.72) 
(7.73) 
H(TW) = i a(TW) 
at 	
(7.74) 
The system is invariant under time reversal if the time-reversed equation is equiv-
alent to the original. Taking the complex conjugate, we have 
(.a uw)  
H*(UW) = t 	
(7.75) 
at 
Thus, the system is invariant under time reversal if the Hamiltonian is real: 
H = H* 	
(7.76) 
which implies that the Lagrangian must be real. 

135 
Problems 
Without going through all the details, we can conclude that 
TA k (r)T-1 _Ac (r) 
y 0 y5  (r)  
(7.77) 
The first follows from the requirement that Ak  transform like the current density, 
which must change sign, because classically it is a velocity. The second follows from 
the fact that y 0 y 5  is the transformation that preserves the Dirac equation under 
time reversal, as shown in (6.70). It is straightforward to verify that the Lagrangian 
is invariant, if the charge e is real. 
There is a theorem known as the PCT theorem, which states that a local field 
theory that is Lorentz invariant is automatically invariant under the product PCT, 
even though it may not be separately invariant under P,C,T separately. We refer the 
reader elsewhere [1] for proof.

Dynamics of Interacting Fields

Time Evolution 
The dynamics of a quantum mechanical system is governed by the Hamiltoni-
an H, which generates time translations. One may view the time development from 
different perspectives. In the Schrbdinger picture, one regards the operators O s  as 
time-independent objects, and the state vector lifs  changes with time according to 
the Schr6dinger equation 
vf
,a  s (t) 	
 = H lifs (t) 	
(8.1) 
a t 
Assuming that H is time-independent we have the formal solution 
ips(t) 	
e—itH 	
(8.2) 
The matrix element of an operator O s  evolves in time according to 
(0 5 (t)10 5 1W5 (t)) = (0,(0)le"HOse't w5(0)) 	
(8.3) 
The subscript s identifies states and operators in the Schr&linger picture. 
In the Heisenberg picture, the state is assumed to be constant in time, but the 
operators evolve. The matrix elements of an operator must be independent of the 
picture, and this requirement relates the Heisenberg picture to the Schrbdinger 
picture: 
tlfh = W5 (0) 
Oh(t) = e itHose — itH 	
(8.4) 
The subscript h labels states and operators in the Heisenberg picture. The two pic-
tures coincide at time t o, which will be taken to be zero from now on. The equation 
of motion in the Heisenberg picture is 
,aoh (t) 	
 = [Oh(t), LI] 	
(8.5) 
at 
If the Hamiltonian has explicit time dependence, then e —ItH  will be replaced by a 
more complicated evolution operator, but Wh is still defined to be constant in time.

8 Dynamics of Interacting Fields 
8.2 
Interaction Picture 
Suppose the Hamiltonian can be split into a "free" part and an interaction term: 
H = Ho  ± 	
(8.6) 
where Ho  represents an "unperturbed" system that we understand. The two terms 
above are time-dependent, even if H is independent of time. By convention, the 
split is made at some fixed time, say t = 0. Thus, Ho  and H' are constant operators 
by definition, being shorthands for H0 (0) and H 1 (0). 
We now introduce the interaction picture, in which Ho  governs the time evolution 
of operators, while H' governs that of the state vector. In this picture, the state W, 
and operators 0 s  are related to those in the Schriklinger picture by 
W(t) = e iH°' tlfs (t) 
0,(t) = e` 1-1°`Os e — ` 1-10 ' 	
(8.7) 
Thus, interaction-picture operators are the Heisenberg operators of the unper-
turbed system. 
The equations of motion in the interaction picture can be found by substituting 
(8.7) into the Schrbdinger equation, resulting in 
,aw,(t)

(8.9) 
We define an evolution operator U( t2 ,  t1 ) through 
'F (t) = U(t, to) W.,(to) 	
(8.10) 
It is a unitary operator, since H' is hermitian, and the norm of V", (t) is conserved: 
Ulr(t, to) U(t, to) = 1 
The following properties are easily deduced: 
U(t, t) = 1 
U(ti, to) = U-1  (to, t1) 
U(t2, to) = U(t2 , t1 ) U(ti , to) 
The equation of motion can now be cast in the form

8.2 Interaction Picture 
It is not trivial to solve for U(t, to), because  Hi(ti ) and PO t2 ) generally do not 
commute. Let us divide the time interval (t, to) into N small steps of duration A t: 
A t  = (t — to)/N 
To first order in A t, the equation of motion gives 
U(to  +  At, to) =  [1—  1-1/ (to).4 	
U(to , to)

(8.15) 
The last factor is of course unity. We built up the finite time interval t — to  from 
successive infinitesimal ones. Putting 
t n  = to  + nA t 	
(8.16) 
we have

This is a formal solution to the equation of motion. 
To make the integration regions more symmetrical, consider, for example, the 
integral in the third term: 
11  = j dt f ' 
 d t2  Fr (t i )Hf(t 2 )

where the integrations extend over the region I in Figure 8.1, in which t 1  > t2 . If 
we integrate over region II, we would have 
t2 
= 	
d t2 f d ti H I ( t2) H I (t1) 
to 	
t0 
where t2  > t 1 . The ordering of the operators in the integrand is such that they stand 
in chronological order from right to left. Evidently 1 1  = /2 , for they differ only by 
an exchange of integration variables. We can therefore replace  11 by ( + 12 ) 12,

In this form, we should expand the exponential in a power series, and then apply 
the operator T to each term.

Adiabatic Switching

t —> ±oo. To make the expression well-defined, we assume that the interaction

"switched off' very slowly in the distant future. Specifically, we replace H' with

(8.24) 
E 
This is a unitary operator: 
ST S  =

(8.25) 
and is central to the theory of scattering, which we shall discuss later. 
Let us put adiabatic switching to use. We assume that the vacuum state in the 
Heisenberg picture 10) is unique and normalizable: 
(010) = 1 	
(8.26) 
The interaction-picture vacuum state 1W0 (t)) evolves according to the interaction 
Hamiltonian, with initial condition1W0 (0)) = 10), up to a phase factor. By switching 
off the interactions, we make 
lim  I  Wo ( t)) = 1 0 )

which defined the phase. In the infinite future we have 
lim 1 1F 0(t)) = S10) = ei L 10) 
t —oo 
(8.27) 
(8.28) 
where L is a real number. Taking the scalar product of the above with (01, we obtain 
e` =  (OIS  10) 	
(8.29) 
The relation between the interaction and Heisenberg pictures can be obtained 
from (8.7) and (8.4): 
IAA = e i Hot e
t wh  
0 1 (t)  = e 
—i1-1,t O h m e—i He t e i Hot 
(8.30) 
where 
H0  = Ho + 	
t i 	
(8.31) 

8 Dynamics of Interacting Fields 
Substituting this into (8.10), we obtain an explicit form for the evolution operator: 
U0  (t, to) =-- 	
1-10t 	
HE(t -1°) 	
11°1° 	
(8.32) 
We can rewrite (8.30) as 
• (t) = Ue (t, Vfh 
0,(t) = Ue  (t, 0) 0 h(t) UE-1  (t, 0) 	
(8.33) 
The initial time t = 0 can be changed to t = to  by using the identity UE (t, 0) = 
U,(t, to )  U0 ( to, 0) to write 
11-f, (t) = UE (t, to) U, (to, 0) WI, 	
(8.34) 
Owing to adiabatic switching, 
•
( to , 0) = eixoto

to  —> 00 	
(8.35) 
Therefore 
V(t) = U6  (t , -o0) Wh 
0 1 (t) = UE (t, -00) Oh(t) Unt , —oo) 	
(8.36) 
This formula is more convenient to use than (8.33), because the two pictures coin-
cide at t —> —oo, when the system was being prepared. As we shall see, perturba-
tion theory relies on this relation. 
Why is it legitimate to use adiabatic switching? In the theory of scattering, the 
answer is that it reflects what happens in the laboratory. An incident particle, in 
the form a wave packet, approached the target particle, but did not interact with it 
until the collision took place. After the collision, the scattered particles eventually 
leave the scattering region as non-overlapping wave packets, and there is no inter-
action after that time. The adiabatic switching is a mathematical simulation of the 
situation, justified by the fact that the scattering cross section is insensitive to the 
detailed shapes of the wave packets. 
Actually, adiabatic switching need not correspond to any physical process; in gen-
eral it serves a more abstract function. When we describe a physical process by 
saying "A interacts with B", we have to define what is meant by A and B, and to 
do that we must conceptually turn off the interaction. In the theory of metals, for 
example, it is customary to apply adiabatic switching to the electron-phonon inter-
action, which is of course always present. What we are doing is to imagine that 
the system was "assembled" by putting free electrons into an idealized lattice. As 
long as the conceptual assemblage took place a long time ago, it should not make 
any difference whether it actually happened; but we need it to identify the "free 
parts". 
As long as we accept the crucial formula (8.36), adiabatic switching has done its 
job, and need not be invoked again.

product of Heisenberg field operators: 
G n (xi , • •  , x) = (01T A h(x i)Bh(x 2) • • • Ch(x)j0) 	
(8.37) 
where 10) is the exact vacuum state, normalized such that (010) = 1. They are also 
called vacuum Green's functions, because they satisfy differential equations with a 
delta-function source. But "correlation function" more closely describes their role 
in our applications. 
In the interaction picture, we can use adiabatic switching to "assemble" the cor-
relation functions of the interacting system from those of the unperturbed system, 
and this leads to perturbation theory. Consider a correlation function involving two 
operators: 
G(ti , t2 ) = (01TAh(t i )Bh(t 2 )10) 	
(8.38) 
where we display only the time dependences, the spatial coordinates being kept 
fixed. Our objective is to re-express the above in terms of interaction-picture opera-
tors. 
Consider first the time-ordering t 1  > t2 . From (8.36), we have 
A h(t) = U-1  (t, —oo)A i (t) U(t,  —oc)  = U(—oo, t)A t (t) U-1  (—o o, t) 	
(8.39) 
Thus, 
G(th t2) = (01 U(-00, t1).A 1 (t1)U-1 (-0o, t1)U-1 (t2,  —oc)  
x B 1 (t2)U(t2, — 00)10) 
=- (01  U(—oc,  ti )A,(t i ) U(ti , t2).13,(t2) U(t2, —00)10) 	 (8.40) 
where we have used the relation  U'(—oc,  t 1 ) U-1 (t2 ,  —oc)  = U(ti ,  —oc)  U(—co, t 2 ) 
= U(ti , t2 ). The time development is represented in Figure 8.2(a) by a contour 
beginning from the far right at t =  —oc,  going to t2 , then to t 1 , and then back to 
—oc.  
This contour can be deformed to two straight path from —co to  oc, and from  oc  
to  —oc,  by rewriting 
U(—oc,  t1 ) = U(—co,  oc)  U(oo, t1 ) =  S 
	t1 ) 	
(8.41) 
Therefore 
G(t i , t2) = (01S -1  U(co, t i )A 	
U(ti , t2)B,(t2 ) U(t2 , —oo)10) 	(8.42) 
The new time contour is illustrated in Figure 8.2(b). The returning branch of the 
contour, represented by the operator S -1 , contributes a phase factor when acting 
on the vacuum, for, using (8.28) and (8.29), we can write 
(01 S —1  = e 	
(01 = 
(01S10)

(01 	
(8.43) 

G (ti , t2) = 	
(0 1 S1 0) 
(01 U(00, ti)A (4) U(ti, t2) 13, ( t2) U(t2, —00)10)

Figure 8.2 (a) Contour of time evolution. (b) Contour deformed into two branches. Because of 
the uniqueness of the vacuum state, the lower branch gives only a phase factor. 
Therefore 
The time contour now consists of the path from —oo to  oc  only. The trick to 
straighten the contour works because the vacuum state is unique. If the vacuum 
expectation value were replaced by an ensemble average, then we would be stuck 
with a contour that comes from  —oc and returns to  —oc. A technique to deal with 
such a case has been developed by Keldysh [1]; but we do not need it here. 
We can simplify (8.44) further, by examining more closely the operator 
X = U(oo, ti )A,(t i ) U(ti, t2)B,(t2) U(t2, —00) 
= [Te-117 drH/(r) ] At(ti)  [Te —ii  drHt(T) 
B 1 (t2 ) 
j_•`20„, drxi(r)] 
(8.45) 
If all the exponential factors are expanded out, we will have a sum of terms, each 
containing products of the H' bunched into three groups, of the form 
T {T[Fe(ri)H 1(T2) • • • iA1(ti)T[H /(4) 1-11 (T;) • • • iBt(t2)T[FOrï)-FOri) 
(8.46) 
where we have supplied a redundant T in front, not needed because t 1  > t2 . With 
it in place, however, we are free to rearrange all the H' factors in arbitrary order. 
The condition t1  > t2 , which determines the relative position of A , (ti ) and B,(t 2 ), 
ensures that the factors cannot wind up in the wrong group when the overall time 
ordering is enforced. As a shorthand, therefore, we can write 
X = Te — ` ,11 `1THV) A,(ti)Bi(t2) 	
(8.47) 
The correlation function can then be written in a more compact notation: 
G (ti, l2) = 
(01 S 1 0) 
(01TSA,(ti)B,(t2)10) 
(8.48) 

8.5 S-Matrix and Scattering 
Though derived under the assumption ti  > t2 , this result is also valid for t1  < 
t2 , as one can easily verify by repeating the derivation. The above results can be 
immediately generalized: 
(OITSA,(xi )B,(x2) • 
C1(x)l 0)  
=  
	
(8.49) 
(OIS  0)  
This is convenient for calculations, because the interaction-picture operators evolve 
like free fields. 
8.5 
S-Matrix and Scattering 
In a scattering experiment, an incident beam of particles A falls on a target parti-
cle B, producing a number of outgoing particles C, . . . , D, which are detected by 
devices that measure their momenta, and possibly other quantum numbers. We 
indicate the reaction by 
Ad- B
—>C+•••±D 
The states of the particles are labeled by momentum, mass, spin, and other single-
particle quantum numbers. 
The wave functions of A and B are wave packets that do not overlap initially. 
When they eventually overlap, the reaction takes place, and after a short time the 
final particles emerge from the interaction region as wave packets that recede from 
one another, eventually becoming well-separated. 
The size of the interaction regime is microscopic, and by comparison the wave 
packets is practically a plane wave. In our theoretical treatment, we idealize the 
wave packets as plane waves, but only before the interaction began, and after the 
interaction is over. The is done mathematically via adiabatic switching. 
Let us denote the initial and final free-particle states by O i  and Of respectively. 
In our idealized scattering experiment, O i  is the state prepared in the infinite past, 
and  1 is the state that the detectors are set up to detect in the infinite future. The 
actual state of the system evolves from O i  into some interaction-picture state at 
time to, which is denoted by 
Wi(±)  ( to ) = U( to , —oo) 	
(8.50) 
The superscript (±) indicates that eventually final particles will emerge as outgoing 
spherical waves. In the infinite future, the particle detectors looks for plane waves 
Of instead of spherical waves. The state that will become Of is, at the time to , 
given by 
Vff(  ) (to ) -- U(to , co) Of 	
(8.51) 
147 
where the superscript (—) indicates that it consists of incoming spherical waves in 
the past. The overlap between 01-)  and Wi(+)  is the probability amplitude that the

(8.53) 
where I i) and I f) are free-particle states. Thus, as anticipated earlier, 
S  = u(00,  _00)  = Te—iff°„ dtHt(t) 	
(8.54) 
The process is illustrated in Figure 8.3. 
8.6 
Scattering Cross Section 
Ifs  = 1, then the final state is the same as the initial state, and no actual scattering 
occurs. The probability amplitude that a reaction occurs is therefore the matrix ele-
ment of S — 1. By analogy with potential scattering, we define the T-matrix through 
the relation 
(ii(S — 	
= — 4270464(P — P ) ( f iTii) 
(8.55) 

8.6 Scattering Cross Section 
where P1 and  P1  are respectively the total 4-momentum in the final and initial 
state. The the factor (5 4 ( Pf — Pi) expresses conservation of total momentum and en-
ergy. The energy conserving factor 27r (5(P °, —  P)  is familiar from potential scatter-
ing; it comes from the assumption that the total Hamiltonian is time-independent, 
and that the process was observed over a long time. The momentum-conserving 
factor (270 3 6 3 ( Pf — Pi ) was extracted from the transition matrix element, under 
the assumption that the system is invariant under spatial translations. 
The transition probability for the reaction i 	
f is given by 
I f I ( s — 1)101 2  = (2 T)4 6 4 (0) (17)464 ( Pf — Pi )1(fITIO 	 (8.56) 
The factor (2yr) 4 (5 4 (0) should be interpreted as the total volume of space-time, being 
the limit 
(2n)464 (0)  = Bin 	
x e iP•x 
P—>-0 
(8.57) 
We omit this factor to obtain the transition rate per unit volume. 
The final state f, which must lie in a continuum of states, is contained in an 
infinitesimal neighborhood d Q of some state. For example, we may specify that 
final particles are scattered into specific solid-angle elements. The transition rate 
per unit volume into d Q is given by 
dR = 	
(27 ) 464 ( pf  _ POI( f IT1i)1 2  = Ida 	
(8.58) 
fEd52 
This defines the differential cross section du, with the incident flux I given by 
= 	
n 2 v12 	
(8.59) 
where v12  is the relative velocity of the colliding partners, and n 1  and n2  their spatial 
densities. For the decay of an unstable particle from the initial state i, the lifetime 
is given by 
,L(2,)4,54(pf  
V 
(8.60) 
where the sum extends over all possible final states f. 
The S-matrix is unitary:  SI S  = 1. In terms of the T-matrix this means 
(11( T — TI- )J i) = 	
(2a- )4 4 ( Pi — PO( 	
( n T Ii) 	
(8.61) 
Putting f = i, we obtain the optical theorem:

where a t°, is the total cross section. 

8 Dynamics of Interacting Fields 
The normalization of particle wave functions affect the matrix element (f1T1i), 
phase space volume elements, and the incident flux I; but the cross section is in-
dependent of the convention, as long as it is used consistently. A wave function 
normalized to n particle per unit volume has the form 
ip.r 	(boson) 
(r) =

particle state 1p) with the properties

(2yr)3n iP) (Pi = 1 	
(8.64) 
Whatever we choose for n, the convention must be adhered to in the expansion of 
field operators into creation and annihilation operators. 
The convention used in this book is n = 1. With this, the creation or annihi-
lation of a boson or fermion is accompanied respectively by a factor (2E) — 
 1/2 or  
(m/E) -1 /2 . This is indicated in the field expansions (2.29) and (7.16) respectively, 
and originates from the fact that the boson Lagrangian is quadratic in the time 
derivative, whereas the fermion Lagrangian is linear. By taking 
2E 	
(boson) 
n = 	
(8.65) 
E/  m 
(fermion) 
these factors disappear in the field expansions, but reappear in the properties of 
1p). This convention is call invariant normalization, because it has the same form 
in all Lorentz frames. In practice, it makes little difference which convention we 
choose, for these factor appear either with the matrix element, or appear squared 
in the phase-space volume element. It is merely a matter of when to include them.

The transition rate I du is not changed. 
8.7 
Potential Scattering 
To help understand scattering in quantum field theory, we give a parallel descrip-
tion of potential scattering in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. The experimen-
tal situation is that a steady beam of particles is scattered by a potential well, and 
detectors are set up very far away to register scattered particles of definite momen-
ta. The incident beam is represented by a stream of non-overlapping wave packets, 
which can be considered one at a time. A wave packet must small enough that it 
does not overlap the scattering center initially, but large enough that its momentum 
can be well defined. It is assumed that the wave packet does not spread appreciably 
during the course of the experiment. We imagine the wave packet getting larger 
and larger, and ultimately approaching a plane wave. 
In the plane-wave limit, the overall scattering process is described by the station-
ary wave function 71, (r) of the particle, which satisfies the Schrôdinger equation 
with outgoing-wave boundary condition: 
1 
2m  V

(r) = E 
(r) 
e ikor 
 (r)  
	f(Q ) 	
 
r  >00 
 
(8.69) 
where V(r) is the scattering potential, and Q denotes the scattering angles. We have 
written r = rI, ko  = kol,  and E = ki /2 m. The the incident wave corresponds to 
exp(iko  • r), and the outgoing spherical wave corresponds to exp(i ko  r)/ r. We can 
calculate the number of particles scattered per unit time into solid angle d S2 from 
the current density of the scattered wave. The differential cross section d  u/ d S2 is 
the above rate per unit solid angle, divided by the incident flux. This procedure 
yields the familiar result 
du 	
 = 	
Q )1 2  
d S2 
(8.70) 
where f (Q ) is called the scattering amplitude. The wave-packet nature was taken 
into account through the neglect of interference between incident and scattered 
wave. 
In the laboratory, scattering is a time-dependent process, which can be described 
by the stationary wave function 1,0(+) through the following construction. Let the 
initial wave packet be 
F(r) = f d 3 k f 	
r 

152 I 8 Dynamics of Interacting Fields 
where f(k) is a function peaked about k = 1(0 . Then the time-dependent wave 
function describing the actual scattering process is 
W(r, t) = f d 3 k f(k)V4,±) e— l Et  
where E = k 2/2m. A "motion picture" of this wave function will show the 
wave packet being scattered by the potential, receding as an outgoing spher-
ical wave front. The stationary wave function obtains in the plane-wave limit 
f (k) 6 3  (k — k0). 
We now restate the problem in a more formal language, to compare with the 
treatment in quantum field theory. Let us write the Hamiltonian as 
H = Ho + V 	
(8.71) 
with Ho  = —V2/2 m. Consider the eigenvalue problem with a continuous spectrum 
E: 
(Ho ± V)14o  (r) = E» (r)

v(±)(r)

f(s 2  )

(8.72) 
where the superscript (±) labels a solution with outgoing (incoming) spherical 
wave. The unperturbed problem at the same energy E is defined by 
Ho Oko  = E0k0 	
(8.73) 
where 
Ok = e ik.r 	
(8.74)

We define the T-matrix by

(8.76) 
It satisfies the Lippmann—Schwinger equation

where k is the scattered wave vector, with magnitude ko  and polar angles  Q.

8.7 Potential Scattering 
153 
The set of wave functions with the (+) and (—) boundary conditions separately 
form complete sets of eigenstates of H, (barring bound states.) The unitary trans-
formation matrix relating the two sets is called the S-matrix: 
(1(1 s 110 
) , h (+)) 
k0 ) 
(8.79) 
To find the relation between the S-matrix and the T-matrix, rewrite (8.75) in the 
more explicit form 
,h(±)

we have

E — H

(8.81) 
where P denotes principal part. We therefore have 
ko  — ko

Now take the scalar product of both sides with respect to 1p k  , noting that 
(V)(k+), 	
= (klko) = (2.7) 3 6 3 (k — ko ) 	
(8.83) 
This leads to 
(k1S1k0) = (kl  [1— 27rià (Ek — Ek o ) T] iko) 	
(8.84) 
Energy conservation is enforced in the S-matrix, but not in the T-matrix. The latter 
can be defined for arbitrary E, including complex values, through the Lippmann—
Schwinger equation (8.77). 
We can write as an operator relation 
S = 1— 2yrià(E — H)T 	
(8.85) 
The unitarity condition  St  S = 1 implies that 
T 	
T = 27riTtô(E — H)T 	
(8.86) 
The diagonal matrix element of this relation gives the optical theorem: 
4,7 
otot 	Im f(0) 
(8.87) 
where ato, is the total cross section for incident wave number k, and f(0) is the 
scattering amplitude in the forward direction.

8.8 
Adiabatic Theorem 
The meaning of the S-matrix rests upon the statements (8.27) and (8.28). That 
is, the vacuum state in the interaction picture approaches that of the Heisenberg 
picture in the infinite past and in the infinite future. The two limiting states can 
differ only by a phase factor, which defines the S-matrix. The assumption was that 
the system remains in an evolving ground state, and does not get excited from 
it. A formal statement is the adiabatic theorem, which can be loosely stated as fol-
lows: 
A system being perturbed in its ground state will remain in the ground state, as long 
as the perturbation varies sufficiently slowly with time. 
A precise mathematical statement of the theorem will be given later, after we 
develop some mathematical tools. 
We write the Hamiltonian in the form 
H = Ho  ±  AH' 	
(8.88) 
where H' is the interaction to be turned on and off by adiabatic switching, and 
A is a parameter introduced for convenience, to be set to unity at the end of the 
calculations. The splitting of H into the two terms is made at time t = 0. We 
enclose the system in a large but finite box, and assume that the eigenvalues of H 
are discrete and non-degenerate. 
Suppose W is an eigenstate of H, and 0 the corresponding unperturbed state: 
H E 
H00 =EM 
(0 , 0) = 1 	
(8.89) 
In stationary perturbation theory, the relation between W and 0 can be found as 
follows. We write 
(8.90) 
where (x, 0 ) = 0. Note that W is not normalized to 1. It simplifies the analyze to 
take the coefficient of 0 to be unity. Substituting this equation into H W = E W, 
we obtain, after some rearrangement, 
(E — 0)0 = (Ho — E)2( — A 	
(8.91) 
Taking the scalar product of this equation with 0, we obtain an expression for the 
perturbed energy: 
E = 	
+ A(0 , H' Vf) 	
(8.92) 
The perturbed state W is found by solving for x from (8.91). To insure that the 
result is orthogonal to 0, we first multiply both sides of (8.91) by the projection 
154

We then obtain the result

(8.94) 
The following is an equivalent form of the equation with the unperturbed energy 
EM in the denominator: 
1 
W = 	
H0  — E(c )  Q(H t 	
— E) 	
(8.95) 
The formulas for E and W are valid for any state, as long as the energy levels do not 
cross when A varies from 0 to 1. In particular, we use them for the vacuum state, 
which is assumed to be unique for all A. 
With adiabatic switching, the Hamiltonian is taken to be

a) Consider the scattering of a charged particle by the Coulomb potential of an 
atomic nucleus, as in Rutherford scattering. The scattering amplitude involves 
the Fourier transform of 1/ r, which is ambiguous due to the lack of conver-

a definite scattering cross section in the limit a —> 0. 
b) The screening is a mathematical device like adiabatic switching. Why does it 
make sense physically in this case? 
c) Can you think of circumstances in which the screening device should not be 
used, because it would correspond to the wrong physics? (Hint: Would you get 
plasma oscillations if the Coulomb potential is screened?)

Perturbation Theory 
We have obtained the S-matrix as an expansion in powers of the interaction Hamil-
tonian. Perturbation theory is based on this expansion, considered an asymptotic 
expansion, whose first few terms can give very good approximations. Whether the 
expansion actually converge is usually unknown. The value of perturbation theory, 
however, goes beyond obtaining good numerical answers, for the following rea-
sons: 
• The formal sum of the perturbation series, or even a partial sum, can reveal in-
teresting properties of the theory, as for example the renormalizability of quan-
tum electrodynamics. 
•
Divergence of the perturbation series usually signals "non-peiturbative" effects, 
such as the formation of bound states or solitons, or the onset of a phase transi-
tion. 
In this chapter, we illustrate the use of perturbation theory in the calculation of 
S-matrix elements in the çb 4  theory. The Lagrangian  density of the theory is given

where q5 (x) evolves in time like a free field. Our goal is to calculate the matrix 
element of S between given initial and final free-particle states. 
The field operator çb  (x) contains two terms: a positive-frequency part that annihi-
lates a particle, and a negative-frequency part that creates a particle. The n-th order 
term in the S-matrix is a sum of terms, each of which is a product of creation and 
annihilation operators. To obtain the matrix element of such a product, we first try 
to rearrange the order of the factors in normal order — with all annihilation opera-
tors standing to the right of all creation operators. In general, the factors involved 
do not commute with one another, and we will generate other terms in the rear-
rangement process. This is, however, a finite process, and in the end we will obtain 
the nth-order S-matrix as a finite sum of normal products. Once this is done, the 
matrix element can be read off, because a normal product has non-vanishing ma-
trix element only between an initial state containing the particles to be annihilated, 
and an final state containing those to be created. In the following we develop some 
mathematical tools to implement this task. 
9.2 
Time-Ordered and Normal Products 
In this section, let capital letters, such as A, denote either a creation or annihilation 
operator for fermions or bosons. The commutator between any two boson opera-
tors, or the anticommutator between any two fermion operators, is a c-number. The 
same is true of the commutator between a boson and a fermion operator. Such a 
commutator or anticommutators may be replaced by its vacuum expectation value. 
We restate the definitions of time-ordered and normal-ordered products in a more 
formal way. 
A time-ordered product (T-product) is defined as 
T(A1A2 
• An) 	
ABBi B2 • • Bn 	
(9.5) 
where { Bi } is the same set of operators as {A i }, except possibly in different order, 
such that an operator with a later time label appears to the left of one with an earlier 
label. The quantity rJAB  is a signature factor: 
if {A} and { B } differ by an odd permutation

Time-ordering is distributive:

A normal product (N-product) is defined as

Cn 
where {C} is the same set as {A}, except possibly in different order, such that in 
the set { C i  } all creation operators appear to the left of all annihilation operators. 
The signature factor 77 AC has been defined in (9.6). Normal-ordering is distribu-
tive:

AC B' _= ±(0IABIO)C

where the sign is ± depending on whether an even or odd number of fermion 
operators exchange position when B is pulled across C to the left. If there is more 
than one contractions in a product, we distinguish the different contractions using 
multiple dots: 
A .  B" C s" D E •  F." G" = ±(01AE10) (OP G10) (0ICF10)D

Wick's Theorem 
The operator form of Wick's theorem tells us how to expand a T-product into 
N-products. A T-product orders operators according to time labels, regardless of 
whether they are creation or annihilation operators. An N-product, on the other 
hand, orders operators according to whether they are creation or annihilation op-
erators, regardless of time label. Thus, it is sufficient to learn how to expand an 
ordinary product into N-products, because at fixed times a T-product is just an or-
dinary product, and the N-product does not care about time labels. Since a single 
operator is its own N-product, the non-trivial cases start with a product of two op-
erators. The general result will be obtained by induction on the number of factors 
in the product.

a) For two boson operators, 
In the latter case we write 
A 2 A 1  = A 1 A 2  + [A 2,  A 1 ]  = A 1 A 2  + (0 1[A2, A 11 10) 
= A A 2 — (0 1A i A 2 10) 	
(9. 15 ) 
where the last step follows because (01A 2  = O. Therefore, if A2 is a creation 
operator, we have 
This is also true if A2 is an annihilation operator, for then the second term 
vanishes. 
b) For two fermion operators, 
In the latter case write 
—A 2 A 1  = A 1 A 2  — 2, 	
= A1A2 — (011A2, A1110) 
= A 1 A 2  — (01A 1 A 2 10) 	
(9.18) 
which leads to the same result as in the boson case. 
If one operator is boson, and the other fermion, then the boson calculations 
apply, for the operators commute.

The extension of Lemma 3 to a T-product Is straightforward, because for any

Corollary: Wick's theorem also holds when any A 1  is replaced by a linear combina-
tion of creation and annihilation operators. 
A weaker form of Wick's theorem deals with vacuum expectation values of a

It is convenient to represent the procedure graphically as follows. The basic inter-
action consists of a product of 4 field operators at the same space-time point, which 
we call a "vertex". It may be depicted as follows:

We draw a line sticking out from each field operator, to represent a possible incom-
ing or outgoing particle. These lines are distinguishable, since each corresponds to 
a factor 0 (x) at a definite position in the product. 
A contraction a la Wick's theorem will be indicated by joining the lines of the 
operators being paired. This produces an "internal line" representing a propagating 
virtual particle:

An uncontracted line is an "external line" associated with a particle in the initial 
state or final state, whose wave function depends on the normalization convention.

Figure 9.2 Second -order graphs for a scattering process. 
According to Wick's theorem, we must make all possible distinct choices of con-
traction schemes, normal order the results, and add their contributions. In graphi-
cal terms, to normal ordering is to assign external momenta to uncontracted lines. 
This procedure gives rise to the Feynman graphs shown in Figures 9.2 and 9.3. The 
pattern (9.37) gives rise to the three graphs in Figure 9.2, which differ only in the 
assignment of external momenta to the external lines. The number of terms in the 
Wick expansion corresponding to each of these Feynman graphs is

The first factor 2 comes from interchanging the positions x1  and x2 , which are 
to be integrated over the same domain. The numerator in the next factor comes 
from permuting the 4 lines of each vertex among themselves; but this overcounts 
by a factor 2, because of a symmetry: interchanging the two internal in graph 1 
Figure 9.2 does not lead to a distinct situation. Thus we divide by 2. The 4! in both 
coupling constants are again canceled. If it were not for the symmetry in the graph, 
the factor 1/2! in front of the second-order S-matrix would also be canceled. The 
correction factor for overcounting is called the symmetry number of the graph, which 
we shall discuss later in more general terms.

In non-relativistic perturbation theory, virtual transitions conserve momentum 
but not energy. That is, virtual particles go "off energy shell". In contrast, virtual

transitions here conserve both momentum and energy, but the squared mass be-
comes unphysical, being 1c 2  instead of the fixed value m2 . We say that a virtual 
particle propagates "off mass shell". 
It is evident from (9.39) that an incoming particle of 4-momentum p ," is asso-
ciated with factor exp(—ip • x), while an outgoing one with exp(ip • x). We can 
therefore convert an initial particle to a final one, or vice versa, by simply reversing 
the sign of its 4-momentum. This property is called crossing symmetry. 
From gl , we can obtain the contributions gi and g3  of graphs 2 and 3 in Fig-
ure 9.2 by interchanging momentum labels. To get g2 , we interchange p 3  and /9 4 , 
and to get g3 , we interchange /9 2  and —p 3 . The last operation is an illustration of 
crossing symmetry. The sum of the three graphs gives

In the following, we state the rules to generate all Feynman graphs of this order. 
First, draw n vertices, with 4 lines emanating from each vertex. Then, contract the 
4n lines attached to the vertices in all possible manners, including no contraction. 
Each distinct contraction scheme gives a graph. Assign external momenta to the 
uncontracted lines (the external lines.) for either incoming or outgoing particles. 
Each distinct assignment gives a Feynman graph. The matrix element correspond-
ing to a Feynman graph can be obtain by inspection, through the use of the Feyn-
man rules. For real 0 4  theory they are as follows: 
•
An n-th order Feynman graph consists of n vertices where 4 lines meet. Some 
of these are internal lines carrying a internal 4-momentum. Others are external 
lines identified with incoming or outgoing particles of definite momenta. 
•
Each vertex contributes a factor —1:2 0 . The net 4-momentum flowing into each 
vertex is zero. 
•
An external line of 4-momentum p contributes a factor (2(.0 p ) -1/2 . It is an in- 
coming particle if p o  > 0, outgoing if p o  < O. 
•
An internal line of 4-momentum 10 contributes a factor 
0+ ) 
i F (k) 	
k2 	
+ 
Not all internal momenta are independent because of 4-momentum conserva-
tion at vertices. The independent ones are integrated with measure (2.7)-4 d4  k. 
* Overall conservation of total 4-momentum is enforced through a factor 
(27)4 .64(P1 —  Pi) 
where P1 and Pi  are respectively the total 4-momentum of the final and initial 
state. 
e The graph is divided by a symmetry number S. 
In general, the symmetry number has to be worked out for each graph. However, 
in 0 4  theory, a rule can be stated for connected non-vacuum graphs (graphs with 
external lines, with no disjoint subgraphs.) In such a graph, k internal lines are said 
to form an equivalent set, if they all share the same vertices at both end. If there 
(9.44) 

9.5 Types of Feynman Graphs 
are more than one such set, containing respectively k b  k2 , ... internal lines, then 
the symmetry number of the graph is s)  
S = I 
ki! 	
(9.45) 
Vacuum graphs do not follow this rule. An example is given in Section 9.5 below. 
There are topological relations among graph elements. Consider the more gen-
eral 0 K  theory, in which K lines meet at a vertex. We may say that an external line 
"uses up" 1/K vertex, while an internal lines uses up 2/K  vertex. Therefore, for a 
graph with n vertices, L e  external lines, and L i  internal lines, we have the relation 
Le  ± 2L i  = Kn 	
(9.46) 
In the case under discussion, K = 4. 
The 4-momenta of internal lines are not independent of one another, because of 
4-momentum conservation at each of the n vertices. There are thus n conservation 
conditions, of which one is taken into account through total 4-momentum conser-
vation. This leaves n — 1 constraints on the Li internal 4-momenta. The number of 
independent internal 4-momentum is accordingly 
N, = L, — (n —1) 	
(9.47) 
This is the number of f d4 k integrations in a graph.

The final form can be written down directly using the Feynman rules. The factor

tal volume of space-time. Vacuum processes such as this one occur with uniform

probability over all space-time, and they can accompany any reaction we consider. 
Thus, the sum of all vacuum processes (01S10) occurs as a factor in any S-matrix 
element. As we shall show below, this factor is a phase exp(i 00), and so does not 
affect transition probabilities. From a practical point of view, therefore, vacuum 
graphs may be ignored. 
9.5.2 
Self-Energy Graph 
An example of a self-energy graph is Figure 9.1(c), which describes a particle in-
teracting with itself while propagating in the vacuum. It does this by emitting and 
reabsorbing a virtual particle at the same point. Alternatively, we can say that the 
particle creates a virtual pair, which eventually annihilates. The matrix element is 
gself = (NI S (1) 1130 = —i20 f d4Xi(p210110)(01T01011°)01011P1)

(9.49) 
Again, we could have obtained this directly from the Feynman rules. 
Such a self-energy "bubble" can be inserted into any line, external or internal, 
any number of times. Some examples are shown in Figure 9.3. We shall discuss 
such insertions systematically in Section 13.2. At this point, we merely mention 
that the effect of all possible self-energy insertions is to replace the free propagator 
F (k) by a "full propagator" d'F  (k), in which the mass pole at k 2  =- m is shifted 
in position, and the residue is also changed. The shifted positions corresponds 
to a "renormalized mass", and the changed residue corresponds to a change in 
normalization of the wave function, by a factor conventionally designated as 
the "wave function renormalization". 
9.5.3 
Connected Graph 
A connected graph does not contain disjoint subgraphs. The converse is a discon-
nected graph, illustrated by graph 4 of Figure 9.3, which corresponds to the matrix 
element 
Ç4 — gvertexgvac 	
(9.50) 
This describes a vacuum fluctuation during scattering. As mentioned before, vac-
uum component of graphs can be ignored. 
Graphs 13-15 of Figure 9.3 are disconnected graphs describing separate uncor-
related events. (One takes place on Earth, the other on Mars a thousand years later, 

71 
9.6 Wick Rotation 
perhaps.) For example: graph 13 corresponds to two independent self-energy in-
teractions; graph 14 represents a scattering event, with a spectator particle inter-
acting with itself; graph 15 describes two independent uncorrelated reactions. Dis-
connected graphs do not require separate calculations, because they are products 
of lower-order connected graphs. Therefore, we only need to consider connected 
graphs. 
9.6 
Wick Rotation 
In calculating a Feynman graph, we generally have to integrate over internal 4- 
momenta. Consider the self-energy graph gself, where we encounter the integral 
I = f d4 k 
1 
(9.51) 
k 2  — Lfl + iy 
Putting aside the question of convergence, let us first describe how the "mass-shell" 
singularity at k 2  = m(2)  should be handled. Written more explicitly, the integral 
reads 
cc 
— f d 3
k 	
f 	
1 
dk o 	
(9.52) 
_co 	
k(2 — (k2  + m(2) ) — i 
The term i y in the denominator displaces the mass-shell poles away from the path 
of integration, as shown in Figure 9.4(a). Since the integrand has no other sin-
gularities in the ko-plane, we can rotate the ko  contour counter-clockwise, until it 
lies along the imaginary ko  axis, as indicated in Figure 9.4(b). This corresponds to 
making ko  pure imaginary: 
ko  = ik4 	
(9.53) 
where k4  is real. We now have an integral over a 4-dimensional Euclidean space:

imaginary ko  axis can be done in all Feynman integrals, because the integrand does

not contain singularities other than those in the Feynman propagators. A virtual 
particle has Euclidean 4-momentum, instead of Minskowskian, because of the 
in the Feynman propagators. 
9.7 
Regularization Schemes 
Having defined the contour of integration, we are faced with the problem that I 
has an "ultraviolet divergence", at the upper limit of integrations. We must render 
it finite by introducing a high-momentum (or small distance) cutoff. Eventually, 
when all graphs are added up, we hope to "renormalize" the theory, by reexpressing 
the cutoff in terms of experimentally measurable parameters. 
Cutting off the high-momentum contributions means modifying the asymptotic 
behavior of the Feynman propagator, and way to do this is not unique. The simplest 
scheme introduces a sharp cutoff A, by replacing I with 
(9.55) 
The k4  integration can be performed through contour integration:

'"4 
Thus we have 
yr 
Vk2  + rn,6 
(9.56) 
172 
The quadratic divergence when A —> oo is typical of a boson self-energy. 
The sharp cutoff is simple, but not Lorentz -invariant. When it is important to 
keep the theory invariant, we can use the Pauli—Villars regularization, which re-
places the propagator in the following manner: 
1 	
1 	1 
k2 - 	
-± k2 
/11) 	
k2 _ A2 	
(9.58) 
The cutoff A appears as the mass of a fictitious particle, whose propagator has 
the opposite sign from that of a physical particle. Since according to (2.77) the 
residue at the mass pole is the squared modulus of the wave function, the fictitious 
particle here has negative probability, and therefore has no physical meaning. In 
the example considered, the Pauli—Villars regulator gives the same A -dependent 
term as in the sharp cutoff case. 
Another Lorentz-invariant cutoff scheme is dimensional regularization, which is 
based on analytic continuation of the space-time dimensionality. To illustrate the

We are interested in its value near d = 4. Using the formula

which can be continued to complex d. We then put d = 4 ± E, and obtain 
_2ij.r 2 rn2 E-1 
e—>-0 
(9.62) 
This gives the same result as the sharp cutoff if we identify A 2  = 
Still another cutoff scheme is lattice regularization, in which continuous space 
is replaced by a discrete lattice. The advantage of this scheme is that local gauge 
invariance can be preserved, and that it is well suited for Monte-Carlo simulations. 
An example of this is given in Section 16.3. 
9.8 
Linked-Cluster Theorem 
We made the distinction between connected and disconnected graphs, because the 
latter are composed of connected subgraphs. If we know all the connected graphs, 
that is sufficient to generate all graphs. The linked-cluster theorem tell us exactly 
how to do this: 
Theorem 9.2  Linked-cluster theorem: 
exp (Sum of all connected graphs) = (Sum of all graphs) 	 (9.63) 
Proof: Let I-, denote a connected graph, so that the set of all connected graphs is 
{R, F2 , ...}. The general graph g contains m i  copies of Ti, and may be represented 
in the form 
Font Tori2 
g =  1 	
2  
(9.64) 
The factors account for the fact that the copies are indistinguishable. As we shall 
show later, they arise as symmetry numbers. Summing over all possible choices of 
subgraphs gives the sum of all possible graphs: 
c° 
rrn 
 
Eg - 	
m! 
m=0 
173 

174 
9 Feynman Graphs 
This the desired result; but it remains to derive the symmetry numbers. Consider 
the graph composed of m T's. If T is of order n, the graph is of order n m, and has 
the form 
1 
Graph — 	 
 (nm)! f d4 xi • • • cl4xn.( f ITN(xi ) • • R(x)I i) 
 
(9.66) 
A permutation the n m vertices has no effect on the integral; but a permutation that 
bodily interchanges two subgraphs does not give a distinct term in the Wick expan-
sion. Thus, the number of distinct permutations is ( n m)!/ m!, and the symmetry 
number is m!. This completes the proof. 
9.9 
Vacuum Graphs 
First we show that a connected vacuum graph is a pure imaginary number. Con-
sider OK theory, in which an nth-order connected graph is of the form 
F 	
f(d4 k) Ni  
k2  — mo2 )

(9.67) 
where Li is the number of internal lines. For a vacuum graph there are no external 
lines, and so according to (9.46) 
Kn 
L, = 
By (9.47), the number of 4-momentum integrations is given by 
K n 
Ni = Li — n + 1 = 	
 n + 1 
2 
(9.68) 
(9.69) 
After making Wick rotations in all the /co  integrations, the integral gives a real 
number; but the rotations produce a factor i Ni . Thus 
il+Kn 
= in+Ni+L i x (real number) = 	
x  (real number) 	(9.70) 
For K odd, the theory is unphysical, because the Hamiltonian is not bounded from 
below. For K even, the graph is pure imaginary. 11 
It follows from the linked-cluster theorem that the sum of all vacuum graphs is 
a phase factor: 
Sum of all vacuum graphs = (01S10) = 	
(9.71) 
Since vacuum graphs have no external lines, we can freely add them to any graph 
with a fixed number of external lines. Any graph is therefore multiplied by e 1(1) ; 
but this has no effect on the scattering cross section. Therefore we can ignore all 
vacuum subgraphs.

Any graph for the full propagator can be dissected into "one-particle irreducible" 
components, which are graphs that cannot be made disconnected by cutting one 
line. The sum of all irreducible graphs, with external lines omitted, is denoted 
i 17 (k 2), where H (k 2 ) is called the "proper self-energy part". It is also known as 
"vacuum polarization", because describes virtual pair creation and annihilation in 
the vacuum, and for a complex field this creates a fluctuation of dipole moment 
density.

where Ii(x) is the interaction Hamiltonian density. The numerator may be expand-
ed into sums of normal products according to Wick's theorem. Since we are taking 
the vacuum expectation value here, all factors in a normal product must be con-
tracted. This leads to an expansion of the numerator in terms of Feynman graphs. 
Just as in the case of the S-matrix, each graph is multiplied by vacuum subgraphs, 
and the sum of all vacuum graphs occurs as a common factor to all graphs. This 
factor is (01S 0), which cancel the denominator. We may therefore replace the de-
nominator by 1, and at the same time ignore all vacuum graphs.

70 Vacuum Correlation Functions 
The Feynman rules can be derived directly by using 
Theorem 10.1 Wick's Theorem for Vacuum Expectations: 
Let al  • • • a2p  be a product of an even number of creation or annihilation operators, 
and let 
(al  • • • a2p).----  (0 
Then 
Tal  - • - a2p  0) 	
(10.5) 
(a 1  • • • a2p ) = (al  a2 )  (a3  a4) • • • (a2p _i a2p ) 
± Op (al  a3) (a2 a4) • • • (a2p _i a2p ) 
+ • • • (All possible pairings with signature factor) 	
(10.6) 
where the signature factor  Op  is defined as follows. For bosons Op = 1. For 
fermions, Op is the signature of the permutation that will bring the list of oper-
ators in the term that it multiplies to the standard order a l  • - • a2p  . 
The theorem, of course, follows from the operator form given in Section 9.3; but 
a direct proof is simple: The case p = 1 of this theorem is trivial. The general case 
can be proven by induction on p, with the help of the following 
(ai  • • • a2p ) 
01 (a02) (a3 • - - a2 p ) ± 02 (aia3) (a2a4 • • • a2 p ) 
± • • • ± c5 2p_i (ai a2p )(a 2  • — a2p _i ) 	
(10.7) 
PROOF: Let b i  • • • b 2p  be the set a l  • • • a2p  in chronological order. We may assume 
that b i  is an annihilation operator, for otherwise both sides trivially vanish. We 
commute b i  all the way to the right, where it annihilates the vacuum state. Each 
time it commutes across some b n , we write 
bb, + [bl , b n ] 	
(bosons) 
b n b i  + {bi , b n } 
(fermions) 
The commutator or anticommutator above is a c-number, and may be replaced 
by its vacuum expectation value. Further, in the vacuum expectation value, it may 
be replaced by  b 1  b, since  b, l 0) = 0. Then, b i  b, may be replaced by  Tb, b, since 
the operators are in chronological order. This proves that a typical term in the ex-
pansion is generated, whenever b i  is commuted across some b.  The signature 
factor supplies the appropriate sign. 
As an example, consider the two-point correlation function G2 in 0 4  theory: 
G2 (x, y) = (OIT 0(x)0(y)10) 
0, 
— —4! f exi(0lT0 4 (x1 )0(x)0(y)10) + • - - 	
(10.9) 
with the understanding that vacuum graphs are to be ignored. The first term is the 
basic pairing, which gives iA F (X - y). This is represent graphically by drawing a

Compared with Feynman graphs for the S-matrix with external lines, there are only 
two differences: 
• The external 4-momenta are arbitrary, not necessarily on the mass shell. 
•
Each external line contributes a propagator i.-4 F(k), instead of wave function 
(Lok) -1/2 . 
Other than these exceptions, the Feynman rules are the same as those for the S-
matrix.

10 Vacuum Correlation Functions 
10.2 
Reduction Formula 
The converse of the rules stated above is the following: A Feynman graph for the 
S-matrix can be obtained from a corresponding one for the correlation function, by 
performing the following operations for each external line, of 4-momentum k: 
o
, 
Replace the propagator IA F (k) with a wave function (2co k) 1/2 ; 
•
Put k on mass shell. 
While this procedure is correct graph by graph, a neater rule applies to the sum 
of all graphs. The sum of all Feynman graphs can be regrouped, such that all free 
propagators iLl  F (k) are replaced by full propagators i :4 1F, (k), in which the pole in k 2  
is displaced from the bare mass to the renormalized mass, and the residue of the 
pole acquires a factor Z -112  from wave function renormalization. Thus, to obtain 
the S-matrix from the correlation function, we replace i2I( k) by (2co k Z) -1/2 , and 
then go on the renormalized mass shell. This rule is the content of the reduction 
formula [1], as illustrate schematically in Figure 10.2. 
To formally derive the reduction formula, we consider external particles whose 
wave functions are finite wave packets. We shall let them approach plane-waves, 
but only in the final formula. A wave packet f(x) is defined as a normalizable 
solution of the Klein—Gordon equation:

10.2 Reduction Formula 
Figure 10.2 Reduction formula in pictures: The S-matrix can be obtained from the correlation 
function by replacing external full propagators with normalization constants of wave functions. 
Consider now a two-particle scattering process symbolically denoted as 
3 + 4 —> 1 + 2 
(10.17) 
Let the Heisenberg field operator of the i-th particle be j5 i 	
(x,), and its nor- 
malizable wave packet be fi 	
f(x i ). The annihilation operator for the i-th wave 
packet can be defined as 
ai (x0) 	
if  d 3  x fi* ( x) a °
(x) 	
(10.18) 
which is a Heisenberg operator. As xo 	
±co, the wave packets of different par- 
ticles diverge from each other, and eventually the particles will behave like free 
particles. Thus, we may assume 
a(x0) 
X0—> —00 
—> 
N/Z i  art 	
(10.19) 
X0 —>00 
where a tin and  at  are free-field annihilation operators of the plane-wave state i, in 
the limit a —> 0. The factor 
accounts for wave function renormalization. This 
is called the adiabatic condition, which embodies adiabatic switching in the present 
context. 
The free-field operators are defined by the commutation relations 
[aiin, ã j 	
= a il 
 
art ,  7, out 
 
(10.20) 
where, to avoid too many superscripts, we use a bar to denote hermitian conjugate. 
These define two equivalent set of operators that may differ by a phase factor, which 
forms the S-matrix. The initial and final states are defined by 
13, 4in) 	
d'3ndi4n10)

where 10) is the physical vacuum state. The S-matrix element is

dent of time. Therefore 
t2; t3, t4) --> V21222324(1, 21,513,4) 	
(10.27) 
We now calculate the left side using the reduction theorem. Go to (10.24), and 
perform the indicated operation with respect to particle 1, in the limit t 1  —> co. 
This is called "reducing particle 1":

This is the reduction formula. 
We can recover the rules obtained through Feynman graphs as follows: When 
we go to the plane-wave limits of the wave packets, the operator (0 21  + n1 ) can 
be replaced by (-14 + trq), where k 1  is the 4-momentum of particle 1. Thus it 
vanishes, unless canceled by its inverse from the correlation function. The effect is 
to cut off the external leg in the correlation function, forcing it to go on mass shell, 
and multiplying it with (2k10 Z1)- 1/2.

70.3 The Generating Functional 
10.3 
The Generating Functional 
The vacuum correlation functions may be considered to be the response of the 
system to an external source J(x) coupled to the field, which is turned on an off 
adiabatically: 
J(x) 
-÷ 0 	
(10.30) 
IX° I->-00 
The Lagrangian density in the presence of the source is 
Lj (x) = L(x) - J(x)0(x) 	
(10.31) 
where L(x) is the Lagrangian density without source. We assume that the vacuum 
state 10) in the absence of source is unique, with (010) = 1. When the source is 
turned on and off, it remains unique according to the adiabatic theorem of Sec-
tion 8.8. We denote the vacuum in the infinite past by 10- ) j , and in the infinite 
future by 10+) j . These state vectors describe the same state as 10), but may differ 
by a phase W[J]: 
(0+10- ) 	
e iw[J] 	
(10.32) 
Let us go to the interaction picture with respect to the source interaction: 
H' = 	
d 3  x j(x)0 (x) 	
(10.33) 
The field operator in this picture is just the Heisenberg operator in the absence of 
source. According to the adiabatic theorem, we have 
10- ) = 	
dt 
(Op) 
I 0+) ]  = Te- ifIdtH/(t)10) 	
(10.34) 
where 10) is the vacuum state vector at t = 0. Thus 
(0+ 10 — ) j 	
(0 r-re - i 117, dtH/(0 10) = (01Te-l1 d4x  -1(*/)(x) 10) 	
(10.35) 
Taking 6/6 J(x) of the right side brings down a factor  -i(x) from the exponent. 
Hence

tions.

Connected Correlation Functions 
In terms of Feynman graphs, we can state 
G,(xi...., x 0 ) = Sum of all Feynman graphs with n external lines (10.38) 
where the sum include both connected and disconnected graphs. (It is understood 
that vacuum components of graphs are to be omitted.) Since disconnected graphs 
are made up of lower-order connected graphs, it is useful to separate out the con-
nected ones: 
I0 (x1, 
Sum of all connected Feynman graphs 
with n external lines 
(10.39) 
A general G, consists of a number of disconnected components, which we can 
enumerate by giving the "occupation numbers" lab  cr2 , • • • 1, such that there are 
o- k copies of Ik. This is indicated by the formula

where{ a l ,

n = al  + 2a2  + • + nun 	
(10.41) 
In each term of the sum over  {o-k}, there appear n asterisks representing the co-
ordinates xi , 
, x, in some fixed order, and P denotes a distinct permutation of 
these coordinates. The number of such permutations is 
n! 
(o- 1 !... o- 0 !) [(1!)(7 1 • • (n!)al 
When (10.39) is substituted into (10.40), terms in the P-sum give the same contri-
bution upon integration over x 1 ..... x0. Thus we have

Lehmann Representation 
The correlation functions know about the mass spectrum of the field theory. For 
two-point correlation functions, the dependence on the mass spectrum is made 
explicit in the Lehmann representation [2]. We consider a variety of two-point cor-
relation functions, which for a real scalar field are conventionally designated as 
follows: 
iLVF(x) = (01T0(x)95 (0)1 0) 
= (01[0(x), 0(0)110) 
iA (±)f(x) = (010(x)(0)1 0) 
iA (—)'(x) = ( 010(0)0(4 0) 	
(10.46) 
where 0(x) is the Heisenberg operator, and 10) the vacuum state of the interacting 
theory.  The corresponding correlation functions for the free field, denoted without

(10.52) 
which is real, positive definite, and depends on k 2  only by Lorentz invariance. We 
now integrate over kP keeping k2  = m2 , by writing 
f d4 k  _ f drn2 f d4 kc5(k2 m2) 	
(10.53)

d m 2  p(k 2)z1 (±)  (x , m2) 	
(10.54) 
A similar result holds for other correlation function, i.e., a correlation function is 
the spectrally weighted integral of the corresponding free function, over all possible 
values of the mass. In particular, the full Feynman propagator has the representa-
tion

(10.57) 
Consider the function 	
(x) defined in (10.46). Writing x = (x, t), and taking 
the time derivative at t = 0, we have 
21'(x, 	
= —i(01[(x, 0), 0(0, 0)110) = —6 3 (x) 	
(10.58) 
This is also equal to 2i (x,  0), since it depends only on the equal-time commuta- 
tion relation. Thus, performing this operation on both sides of the representation 
f (x)  Loo d m2p(m20 ( x,  rn  2

dyn 20,n2 )  = 1 	
(10.59) 
An elementary particle, defined as a one-particle state 11) with definite mass mi, 
corresponds to a delta-function term in the spectral function: 
p(m 2) z (m 2 _ 	
+ ( n) 	
(10.60) 
where Z = 1( 1 101 0)1 2  is the wave function renormalization constant. The condi-
tion (15.43) implies 
0 	
Z 	
1 	
(10.61) 
We can see from (10.56) that the particle corresponds to a pole in the full propaga-
tor. 
In an interacting theory there may exist bound states, which are states of defi-
nite mass connected to the vacuum through a product of field operators, but not 
through a single field operator. They correspond to poles not in the full propagator, 
but in a correlation function involving 4 or more fields. We shall discuss this in a 
later section.

10 Vacuum Correlation Functions 
10.6 
Dyson—Schwinger Equations 
The Dyson—Schwinger equations are integral equations for vacuum correlation 
functions. We shall illustrate them in a field theory of interacting fermions and 
bosons. The fermion field is denoted v(x) with adjoint zi) (x), and the real boson 
field is denoted by 0 (x). The Hamiltonian density is 
H(x) = NF 
'NB + 
(x) = 	
(x)0(x)lp (x) 	
(10.62) 
where RF and 7-63  are respectively the free fermion and boson Hamiltonian densi-
ty, and g is a coupling constant. Our discussion will concentrate on two- and four-
fermion correlation functions, with the boson field relegated to the background 
role of mediating the interaction between fermions. 
We assume that qp is a column vector, and 
either the hermitian or Pauli ad-
joint; but the number of components are not specified. Similarly, q) may be mul-
ticomponent, and each component may be a matrix on the fermion internal vec-
tor space. The free Hamiltonians, which determine the propagators in Feynman 
graphs, need not be specified in detail. The general form of the Hamiltonian cov-
ers a non-relativistic electron gas interacting through phonons, or quantum elec-
trodynamics, with 0 = y 11  . Our treatment will be based on general properties 
of Feynman graphs, and detailed specifications are purposely avoided, in order to 
focus on the relevant algebraic structure. A property we explicitly assume is that 
fermion number is conserved. 
We consider the two- and four-point fermion correlation functions: 
G2(x, y) = (OIT(x)p(y)I0) 
G4(x1, x2;  y1, y2) = (01TV(xi)V(x2)7P(H1p(Y2)1 0) 	
(10.63) 
where all operators are in the Heisenberg picture, and the spin indices are sup-
pressed. Consider first the two-point function, with Fourier transform 
G2 (x, y) =f ( 612:P)4 G2 (p ) e — ip•(x — y) 	
(10.64) 
The full fermion propagator S(p) is given by 
iS(p) = G2 (p) 	
(10.65) 
This a matrix on the fermion internal space. The Feynman graph expansion is 
shown in Figure 10.3(a). Owing to fermion number conservation, fermion lines 
cannot terminate, and therefore a single fermion line runs through a graph for 
S(p). Since vacuum subgraphs can be omitted, all graphs for S(p) are connect-
ed. Denoting the free propagator by So , and leaving the momentum argument p

i So  + So iZ i So  + So iZ S o iZ i So  + • • • 
= i So  + i So iZ(i So  + So iZ S + • • • ) 	
(10.66) 
where 	
(p) is the sum of all "irreducible" graphs, with external leg amputated, 
as shown in Figure 10.3(b). Here, an irreducible graph is a connected graph that 
cannot be made disconnected by cutting one fermion line. Sometimes one uses the 
name "one-particle irreducible" graph. 
The Dyson—Schwinger equation for G2 is obtained by rewriting (10.66) in the 
form 
S =  So  — SoZ S 	
(10.67) 
When transformed to coordinate space, this becomes an integral equation. The ker-
nel Z is variously called the "proper self-energy", or "mass operator". The explicit 
solution is 
S  = (s0  + 
)-1 	
(10.68) 
This has a simple appearance, but all the complications are buried in Z 
We now turn to the 4-point function. In terms of interaction picture operators, 
we have (without bothering to change notation) 
G4(xi , x2 ; yl, y2) = (01T/p(xi)V)(x2)V(y1)1P(y2)e —if d4x7-1(x) 10) 	
(10.69) 
with the instruction that all vacuum graphs are to be omitted in the Feynman-graph 
expansion. The zeroth-order graphs are shown in Figure 10.4(a), and the second-
order graphs in Figure 10.4(b). Any graph has two fermion lines running through 
it, and they can be drawn either parallel or crossed. The interactions merely "adorn" 
the basic pattern. Each graph with the parallel pattern is in one-one correspondence 
with one with the crossed pattern, in which x1 ,  x2  are interchanged, with a change 
of sign. 
The Fourier transform is denoted by 
(qi, q2I G I pi, p2) = f G4(xi, x2;  Yi'  y2)0Prx1+P2.x2)—i(g1.y1+,12-y2) 	
(10.70) 
where the measure d4  x1 d4 x2  d4 y 1  d4 y is left understood. The same set of Feynman 
graphs describes 3 possible channels of scattering (with off-mass-shell momenta):

the s-channel from now on. 
Let D (xi  , x2; yl, y2) be the sum of all "direct" graphs with parallel fermion lines,

The connected graphs can be decomposed into two-particle irreducible compo-
nents, i.e., connected graphs that cannot be made disconnected by cutting two 
fermion lines. As indicated in Figure 10.5, the sum of all such irreducible com-
ponents, with external line omitted, is denoted by (ql, q21Klpi, P2).

(10.75) 
Further analysis of the integral equation (10.74) is left to the exercises. 
A t-channel process can be described through the continuation (qi, -q21 G iPi, 
—p 2 ). Although such a continuation of (10.74) yields an expression for the cor-
relation function, it is not in the form of an integral equation. to get an integral 
equation for the t-channel, we have to go back to the Feynman-graphs to define a 
different kernel. We refer the reader elsewhere [3] for a more general discussion, 
as well as derivation of integral equations for higher correlation functions. 
10.7 
Bound States 
The distinction between elementary and composite particles is purely theoretical. It 
depends on the model we use to describe the particles. For example, nucleons were 

10 Vacuum Correlation Functions 
once regarded as "elementary", but are now considered bound states of quarks. 
Similarly, the electron is considered elementary because so far it is adequate to 
describe it by a basic field. Within a given quantum field theory, there is a clear 
distinction between elementary and composite particles. 
Like any single-particle state, a bound state should have definite mass and spin. 
In addition, it must be orthogonal to any elementary particle state. For illustration, 
let us consider a bound state in the s-channel, with fermion number 2. Suppose 
x2  have times earlier than those of y 1 , y 2 .We insert a complete set of states into 
the 4-point function: 
(0 1 7.1) (xi) i» (X2) ip (Y1) 1P (F2) 10) 
017- 	
(x2)1n)(n1V(Y1)7P (F2)10) 	
(10.76) 
Only states of fermion number 2 can occur, and the bound state will be among 
them, if it exists. Thus we expect the bound state to show up as a pole of the Fourier 
transform, in an appropriate momentum variable. The residue of that pole can be 
regarded as the wave function of the bound state. 
We introduce total and relative coordinates: 
+ X2 
X = 	 X = X1 + 
2 
Fi + F2  
Y = 	
y = y - F2 	
(10.77) 
2 
and consider times such that x 1 , x2  are well ahead of y i , y 2. This means X°  — Y°  > 
a, where a is some sufficiently large number dependent on x° and y°, as illustrated 
in Figure 10.6. We separate out the term fulfilling this condition by writing 
G4 = 0(X °  - Y °  - a)(01[TI P (X x /2)1P (X — x/ 2)] 
x [Tv (Y 	
y /2)tp (Y — y /2)]10) + 7 	
(10.78) 
where R. denotes the rest. Now insert a complete set of states between the two 
T-products, using the completeness relation 
i= f  (2dyr3)2E1B)(BI  + •— 	
(10.79) 
where I B) denotes a bound state, and the dots denotes contribution from other 
states. The bound state has fermion number 2, and energy-momentum (E, P). In 
the relativistic case E = VP 2  ± M 2 . We have chosen to normalize the bound state 
covariantly, and left understood that I B) depends on P. 
Splitting off the contribution from the bound state, we have

The normalization of the wave function is not fixed by the Bethe—Salpeter equa-

Quantum Electrodynamics

Interaction Hamiltonian 
Quantum electrodynamics (QED) describes the interaction between electrons and 
photons. The Lagrangian density is 
,C(x) = — 1 —4 F"'Fill + V[iY 
(aii + ie0A,) — rrt0]tP 
where Fv" =

AP is the electromagnetic field tensor, AP the 4-vector 
potential, and 7,0 the Dirac spinor field. We use Coulomb gauge, in which 
V • A = 0 	
(11.2) 
The fields are quantized according to canonical commutation or anticommutation 
rules. When there is ambiguity, the order of operators are taken in normal order. 
The charge e0 and mass mo  of the electron are "bare" or "unrenormalized" param-
eters. The corresponding renormalized or physical parameters have the values 
e =  —1.6 x 10-19  Coulomb 
in  = 9.1 x 10-31  kg 	
(11.3) 
We are using rationalized electromagnetic units, in which the dimensionless fine-
structure constant is

77.2 Photon Propagator 
Let us define the "Coulomb propagator" as 
(x °  — y ° ) 
Dcoul(x — y) = 470x 	
yi  
Then the interaction Hamiltonian density can be written in the form 
,2 
Hint(x) = — eo j k (x)A k (x) 	
f d 4yDcoui(x— y) j °(x)j °(y) 
2 
eo  j,„(x)AL t(x) 
In practice we can replace the above with a simpler expression. As shown in the 
following section, the first two terms can be effectively replaced by eo  j (x) A" (x), 
because the difference does not contribute to S-matrix elements. 
In free propagators and external wave functions, the bare mass mo  will be re-
placed by the renormalized mass m when all Feynman graphs are added up. Thus, 
it is convenient to redefined the unperturbed problem such that renormalized mass 
occurs in the free propagator. Accordingly, we take the unperturbed electron Hamil-
tonian density to be 
Rei =T(_ia.V+J3m) iP 
 
(11.18) 
The difference (mo  — m)efi 7p with the original form, called the "mass counter 
term", is considered part of the interaction. With this, the interaction Hamiltonian 
density of QED will later taken to be 
Hint(x) = eo :1P(+ iikext) 	
-  6m: 	11) 	
(11.19) 
where we have used the effective form of the electromagnetic interaction, and 
6m= m — l'110 
(11.20) 
This quantity is considered  O(e) in perturbation theory. In scattering processes 
calculate to second order in eo , therefore, the mass counter term need not be taken 
into account. 
11.2 
Photon Propagator 
Since the Coulomb gauge is not Lorentz covariant, neither is the photon propaga-
tor (OITA" (x) A" (y )10) in that gauge. However, the part of the propagator that con-
tributes to the S-matrix is covariant, because of current conservation. We shall show 
this in the context of electron-electron (ee) scattering, which is indicate schemati-
cally as follows:

namely, in which 10 = (0, k) and I i°  = oo = 0. Let and 12/' be 4-vectors that 
reduce in the special frame to

This replacement applies not just to second-order matrix elements but to higher or-

which we shall use from now on, together with (11.42). 
The freedom of gauge choice is reflected in the fact that terms in the photon prop-
agator proportional to le k " have no effect on S-matrix elements. Special choices 
of such gauge terms can be useful for technical reasons. A popular form of the

replace 4 by 4+  4,„,. In the above we have ignored the term —6m : 1-p :, which 
will be taken care of later. 
We can represent the basic vertex — ieo l-p (x)4(x)lp (x) graphically as shown in 
Figure 11.1. The wavy line represents an incoming or outgoing photon, and a di-
rected line whose arrow points along the direction of flow of electron charge (which 
is negative,) and represents either an electron propagating along the arrow, or a 
positron against the arrow. To generate the Wick expansion of the n-th order S-
matrix, we draw n vertices, and make all possible contractions of the lines. The 
only non-vanishing contractions are the following: 
A" (x)A v  (y) = i Dir (x — y) 
p (x)lp f (y) = S F (x — y) 
(11.45) 
where the electron propagator is given in (7.30). The contraction V) I  (x) (x) does 
not occur, because the interaction is defined as a normal-product. In contrast with 
scalar 0 4  theory, the lines meeting at a vertex are all different. As a consequence, 
the symmetry number is unity for all connected non-vacuum graphs.

Figure 11.6 The effect of the mass counterterm is to replace 
i6m 	
all electron lines by the sum of the two graphs above, where a 
cross denotes a factor id m. 
In this case, interchanging the two vertices does not lead to a new configuration, 
and the symmetry number is 2. But this is a graph we can ignore. 
Consider now the mass counter term — 6 m : z-,/)ip : in (11.19). Because of normal-
ordering, the two fields occurring in this term do not contract with each other, 
and must be contracted with other fields. This term therefore gives rise to a vertex 
where an electron line enters and leaves, with no photon line, and give a factor 
(— i)(-6m) = i6 m. Every internal or external electron line should in principle be 
replaced according to 
iSF 	
iS F 	
iSF(i6 m)iS F 	
(11.70) 
as indicated in Figure 11.6; but Since 6m is consider to be second order in 4, 
the replacement has no effect on second-order matrix elements. Its effect in high-
er orders will be discussed in Chapter 12. We now state the Feynman rules for 
QED. 
11.4 
Feynman Rules 
A Feynman graph is made up of vertices, electron lines and photons lines. An 
electron line is directed. It describes the propagation of an electron along the line 
direction, or a positron against the line direction. A photon line has no direction, 
and represents either an incoming or outgoing photon. 
Each vertex emits an electron line, absorbs another electron line, and emits (or 
absorbs) a photon line. Thus, an electron line cannot originate or end inside a 
graph. This means that "electron number", the number of electrons minus the 
number of positrons, is conserved. The number of photons, on the other hand, is 
not conserved. 
A graph consists of a number of electron lines going through the graph, and a 
number of electron lines in closed loops. On these lines are vertices from which 
photons are emitted or absorbed. A closed loop must have at least two vertices. 
A disconnected graph is a product of its subgraphs. Thus it suffices to consid-
er connected graphs, whose contribution to the S-matrix may be obtained as fol-
lows: 
•
Each vertex with 4 -vector index ,u contributes a factor — ieor". The total 4- 
momentum flowing into a vertex is zero. 
• Each internal photon line of 4 -momentum k contributes a factor i .15 Fy ,( k), 
where kt and y are contracted with the indices of the vertices at its ends. 
•
Each internal electron line of 4 -momentum p contributes a factor i  S (p ). 

71.5 Properties of Feynman Graphs 
•
Each external photon line of momentum k and polarization c contributes a wave-
function factor c,"/,\/2C0k, where kt is contracted with the index of the vertex to 
which the line is attached. 
•
Each outgoing external electron line of momentum p and spin s contribute a 
wave-function factor 
Vrn/ Epu(p, s) 	
(if outgoing electron) 
Ep v(—p, s) 	
(if incoming positron) 
•
Each incoming external electron line of momentum p and spin s contribute a 
wave-function factor 
rn/Ep u(p, s) 	
(if incoming electron) 
m/Ep iJ(— p, s) 	
(if outgoing positron) 
•
Each closed electron loop contributes a factor —1. 
• There is an overall factor (270 46 4 ( Pf — Pi). 
•
Each independent internal 4-momentum k is integrated over, with measure 
d4 k/(2.7) 4 . 
•
Connected non-vacuum graphs have symmetry number 1. The symmetry num-
ber of a vacuum graph is generally different from 1; but vacuum graphs may be 
ignored. (See below.) 
• The contribution of a Feynman graph to a correlation function follows the same 
rules as above, except that the wave-function factors of external lines are replaced 
with propagators. 
11.5 
Properties of Feynman Graphs 
In a general Feynman graph, let 
n = Number of vertices 
E, = Number of external electron lines 
Ei = Number of internal electron lines 
P, = Number of external photon lines 
Pi = Number of internal photon lines 
Note first that n — Pe  is the number of vertices that do not emit external photon 
lines. Since these vertices must be connected in pairs by internal photon lines, we 
have n — Pe  =  2 P1, or 
215 
1 
Pi = 
(n — Pe ) 
(11.72) 

17 Quantum Electrodynamics 
Since an external electron line must enter and exit the graph, Ee  is an even integer. 
An external electron line touches only one vertex, while an internal electron lines 
touches two. Therefore 
Ei  = n — —
1 E, 
2 
(11.73) 
The number of internal 4-momenta is Pi+ Ei , but not all are independent because 
of 4-momentum conservation at the vertices. The overall 4-momentum conserva-
tion is not a restriction on internal lines. Therefore there are n — 1 constraints, and 
the number of independent integrations over internal 4-momenta is 
N = Pi  + Ei — n 1 	
(11.74) 
We can now show that, just as in scalar theory, a vacuum graph in QED is a 
pure imaginary number. In a vacuum graph n must be even. There are E, electron 
propagators of the form 
i(0 + m) 
p 2 
m2 ± ij 
 
where (p  m) yield a real number when operating on a Dirac spinor, and the de-
nominator is real after a Wick rotation. Hence each electron propagator contribute 
a pure-imaginary factor. There are P, photon propagators of the form 
k 2  
which is pure-imaginary after a Wick rotation. 
Therefore a vacuum graph is of the form 
F 	
(-12 0)n 1 E1+ 	
N  f d 4 ki • • • d 4  k N Pki, • • • , kN) 	
(11.75) 
fis real, and a factor i N  comes from the Wick rotations. Noting that (—i)r is real 
because n is even, we have F iEi+ 
N  x (Real number). Since E, = P, =  CI, we 
have Ei  = n, Pi = n/2, N = (n/2) + 1. Thus Ei + Pi  N = 2n + 1. Therefore 
F 	
i x (Real number) 
131 	
(11.76) 
As shown in Section 9.9, this means that the sum of all vacuum graphs gives a 
phase factor, and consequently we can ignore all vacuum subgraphs. 
A useful property, known as Furry's theorem [1], is that a graph or subgraph with 
an odd number of external photons may be ignored, because it is cancelled by 
similar graphs. This is because such a graph must contain one closed electron loop 
that emits an odd number of photons. As illustrated in Figure 11.7, there exist a 
graph identical in every way except that the sense of the electron is reversed. These 
two graphs go into each other under charge conjugation, which sends e0  to —e 0 . 
Hence the sum of the two graphs is zero. 
216  

11.5 Properties of Feynman Graphs 
217 
Figure 11.7 According to Furry's theorem, these graphs cancel each other. They have an odd 
number of external photon lines and no external electrons lines, and differ only in the sense of 
the closed electron loop. 
Suppose the interaction Hamiltonian density is of the form 
I- (x) = P(x) 	
Q(x) 	
(11.77) 
as for example R(x) =  e0  41P+ e0V41extV. The following double series expansion 
makes in possible to take P into account to order n, and Q into account to order m, 
independently: 
s = 	 — 1) n  (-1)' 
n=0 n1=0 
n! 	
m! 
X f d 4  xi  • • d 4  xn +,,T [P(xi) • • • P(xn)Q(xn -pi) • • • Q(x),+)n) 	
(11.78) 
For example, in an atomic problem, we might want to treat the Coulomb interaction 
Ale`xt  exactly, but take radiative corrections into account only to second order. 
To derive this expansion, we start with the  perturbation series 
s = c° (-kl!)k  f ex i  • • • exkT{[(P(xi) + Q.(xi)]• • • [(P(xk) + Q(xk)]} 
k=o 
(11.79) 
and group terms by the number of factors of P. Terms in which P occurs n times, 
regardless of the number of 0-factors, have the form 
E  (n 	
f ex, d4 xn+fn  
in=0 
x T[(P(x1 )- • P(xn)Q(xn+i) • Oxn+m)] 
To get S, we multiply this by (—i)"+"/(n m)! and sum over n. Using 
1 	m\ 	
1 
(n 	
m)!
in 	 n!m! 
we obtain the desired result. •

Electromagnetic Form Factors 
Consider the scattering of an electron by an external electromagnetic field Aeuxt. If 
the external field is very weak, we can treat it in lowest-order perturbation theory, 
but in principle consider radiative corrections to all orders. The S-matrix element 
between the initial state 1 and final state 2 is then, according to (11.78),

Figure 12.3 (a) Proper vertex graphs. (b) Vertex graphs with insertions. 
The electron wave functions are normalized to unit density, and hence in the labo-
ratory frame we have 
I = 	
(12.29) 
the velocity of the incident electron. 
To include higher-order radiative corrections, we only need to replace air" u1  
by a more general quantity corresponding to the Feynman graphs in Figure 12.3, 
which are call "vertex graphs". These graphs can be separated into two categories: 
the "proper" ones and "improper" ones. The former, also called "one-particle irre-
ducible", are connected graphs that cannot be made disconnected by cutting one 
internal line. The improper graphs has insertions on the external lines, and con-
tribute to mass renormalization of the external particles. 
The sum of the proper vertex graphs, with external wave functions omitted, de-
fined the "proper vertex part" 
T"(pi , pi)  =  »U  + Alp2, pi) 	
(12.30) 
where the term y is the bare vertex, and A (pi , p i ) is defined by the series of graphs 
in Figure 12.3(a). The scattering cross section to first order in the external field, 
with all radiative corrections taken into account, is given by (12.28) with 5. 2 y/` 
replaced by 
2 PI  ul. 
By Lorentz covariance, rit  (P2, pi) must be of the form 
r"(pi, P2) 	
C1p  + (- 2 p2 + c3Y ,11  + c4 cruP pi i, + c50-1" 	(12.31) 
where Ci are Lorentz-invariant functions of p i  and pi . Let 
PU  = P1I  ± 
= 14 — 	
(12.32) 
When the external lines are on mass shell, with pi = p  = m2 , there is only 
one independent invariant, which we shall choose to be k 2 . Current conservation 
requires 
224

(12.33) 

72.2 Electromagnetic Form Factors 
This leads to the conditions C1  = C2 = 0 and C4 C5 = 0. Consequently, there are 
only two independent functions C3 and C4, and we can rewrite the vertex operator 
in terms of two invariant form factors: 
1 
Fqpi , p2) = Fi (k 2)r" + 27-
m F2 (k 2)io-""k„ 
(12.34) 
It should be emphasized that there will be extra form factors when p i  and p 2  are 
not on mass shell. 
We now use the Gordon decomposition (Problem 6.6)

For an electrostatic potential A0 = V(r), A k = 0, the second term vanishes when 
k --> 0, and we have 
S1  —> —ie0F1 (0)2yrc5(Ei — E2) f d 3  re — `k.r V(r)C121-ti 	
(12.43) 
This shows that the coupling constant to an electrostatic potential is eci F1 (0), which 
is by definition the electric charge of the particle:

eo  Fi  (0) 	
(12.44) 
Next choose the external field be a static magnetic field B, with A°  = 0, A = 
r x B/2. We have 
Ae:(11" 	
iak„) = —A • (pi + p2 ) 	
i A i o' k 	
(12.45) 
The first term gives no contribution in the limit k

Consider now the F2 041 " term in the vertex part. The S-matrix element for for-

This is called the "anomalous magnetic moment". The total magnetic moment is 
thus given by

The g-factor is given by

The integral is divergent both in the ultraviolet (q 	
oo) and in the infrared (q 
0). The ultraviolet divergence is logarithmic. We introduce both high q and low q 
cutoffs, and explain later how to dispose of them. 
The factors in the denominator of the integrand can be combined, with the help 
of Feynman's formula [3]:

Now change the integration variable from q to q + yp i  + zp 2 . Generally, doing this

(12.59) 
Further simplification can be made by noting that terms linear in q," may be 
dropped because they integrate to zero, that y and z may be interchanged because 
the rest of the integrand is symmetric in y and z. Since we are on mass shell, we 
may also use the Gordon decomposition. After some algebraic manipulations, we

order in quantum electrodynamics, beyond which the weak interactions should be 
taken into account. The result is as follows:

The first term is the prediction of the Dirac equation, dated from 1928, and the 
second the Schwinger correction [4] arising from one Feynman graph. The third 
term is the result of summing 18 Feynman graphs [5], while the fourth involves 72 
Feynman graphs [6]. The comparison with experiments [7] is as follows:

which was obtained experimentally via the Josephson effect. 
The anomalous magnetic moment of the electron arises from the electromag-
netic interactions. Nucleons, on the other hand, have strong interactions, which 
give dominant contributions to their anomalous magnetic moments. The values 
are relatively large, as can be seen from the following experimental values of the

[R2  + (1 — x) 2  — yz(k 2/m2)] 3  
where we have performed a Wick rotation, and changed the integration variable to 
R = V— q 2/ m2 . As we shall see, the high-momentum cutoff A can be absorbed 
through charge renormalization. 
The lower cutoff E is introduced to avoid the "infrared catastrophe" occurring at 
k 2  = 0 and x = 1. The divergence occurs because the photon is massless, and an 
infinite number of channels for multiphoton emission simultaneously open up at 
the same threshold. Our lower cutoff essentially supplies the photon with a finite 
mass, and of course violates gauge invariance. This divergence is real, and must 
be cancelled by the addition of Feynman graphs with soft-photon emission from 
the external lines. Emission of photons of arbitrarily long wavelength cannot be 
detected by any conceivable measuring device, and must therefore be included as 
part of the physical process. The Feynman graphs for the soft-photon processes 
are themselves infrared divergent. It can be shown, however, that when all relevant 
graphs are summed up, the infrared divergences cancel [9, 10]. 
We shall deal only with the ultraviolet divergence here. The form factor at zero 
momentum transfer is given by

which contains the ultraviolet divergence. To isolate it, we define the finite quantity

F1 (0) 
and write 
(12.72) 
F1 (k 2) = F1 (0)f(k 2 ) 	
(12.73) 
Thedivergent factor F 1 (0) can now be absorbed through charge renormalization: 
e0 F1 (k 2) = e f(k 2 ) 	
(12.74) 
The charge distribution in the physical electron is given by the Fourier transform 
of f(k 2). To second order in e0  we can take f(k 2) = 1 + F1 (k 2) — F1 (0), and replace 
CO  by e, since the errors incurred in so doing are of a higher order.

scattering. [After E. E. Chambers and R. Hofstadter, Phys. Rev. 103, 1454 (1956)]. 
The charge structure of the electron has not been seen in experiments so far, 
because it has such a small radius. The proton, on the other hand, has stronger 
interactions, and a bigger charge radius, which has been detected experimentally 
via electron-proton scattering [11]. In this process, the electron produces the virtual 
photon that probes the charge structure of the proton. Figure 12.4 shows the results 
for f 2  ( k 2 ) at various incident laboratory energies of the electron [12]. The straight-
line fit in the semilog plot corresponds to a Gaussian distribution

The proton and neutron have strong interactions, whose contribution to the 
anomalous magnetic moments dominates over that produced by electromagnet-
ic interactions. A phenomenological way to take this into account is to introduce a

Perturbative Renormalization 
13.1 
Primitive Divergences in QED 
Feynman graphs are generally ultraviolet divergent, and a high-energy cutoff A 
is needed. The cutoff sets the scale at which the coupling parameters in the La-
grangian are defined. The process of renormalization relates the parameters at one 
scale to those at another. When this is achieved we can express the "bare" parame-
ters defined at the cutoff scale to the "renormalized" ones at a lower energy scale. 
In this chapter we show how this is done in perturbation theory in QED. 
A Feynman graph in QED may be represented schematically in the form 
f  d4N k 
Graph — 	
(13.1) 
(k2)Pi kE, 
where Pi is the number of internal photon lines, Ei the number of internal elec-
tron lines, and N the number of independent internal 4-momenta. This integral, 
which is generally divergent, is being cut off at a momentum A much larger than 
any physical momenta in the problem. We define a primitively divergent graph as a 
divergent graph that becomes convergent when any one of its internal lines is cut, 
i.e., when any integration variable is held fixed. Any divergent graph can be reduced 
to a primitively divergent one by cutting a sufficient number of internal lines. This 
is obvious because the graph becomes convergent when all internal lines are cut. 
The superficial degree of divergence D of a primitively divergent graph may be 
obtained by counting powers: 
3 
D = 4N — 2/Di — Ei = 4 — Pe  — — E e 	
(13.2) 
2 
where the final result follows by eliminating N, Pi, Ei, using (11.72)—(11.74). This 
number is independent of the number of vertices, and decreases with increasing 
number of external lines. This property is what makes the theory renormalizable. 
It should be noted that the actual degree of divergence may be smaller than 
D. Note also that the counting procedure cannot be used for a non-primitively 
divergent graph. For example, the integral f dkdpk —l p -2  is logarithmically diver-
gent; but power-counting would give D = —1, which suggests incorrectly that it is 
convergent.

Since D > 0 for a divergent graph, and D decreases with the number of external 
lines, there exist only a finite number of types of primitively divergent graphs, and 
they can be classified according to Pe  and Fe . There are 6 possible cases, as shown 
in Table 13.1. Among these, the vacuum graphs can be ignored. The graphs with 
3 external photon lines can be ignored according to Furry's theorem. The graphs 
with 4 external photon lines are logarithmically divergent individually; but it turns 
out that the sum over the 4! possible assignments of external momenta gives a 
convergent result. Therefore, there are only 3 types of primitively divergent graphs: 
electron self-energy, photon self-energy, and vertex. 
Assume that we know how to renormalize the primitive divergences. Then con-
sider a connected non-vacuum graph. We define its skeleton graph as the graph 
obtained after the removal of all SE and vertex insertions. The skeleton may be 
convergent or divergent. If convergent, we reinsert the renormalized SE and ver-
tex parts. If divergent, it must be primitively divergent. To prove the last state-
ment, assume the contrary. Then, by cutting a sufficient number of internal lines, 
the graph can be reduced to a number of components, (possibly disconnected), 
of which one is primitively divergent. The latter must be either an SE or ver-
tex graph; but these have been removed by assumption. Therefore the divergent 
skeleton graph must be primitively divergent. The procedure to renormalize a 
connected non-vacuum graph therefore reduces to that for the primitive diver-
gences.

Electron Self-Energy 
The full electron propagator is defined as 
i[S f (x)],fi = (01TV)(x)(0)10) 
= (OITV) ( )(0)e —i l d YN'61 10) 
(13.3) 
where v) h  is a Heisenberg operator, and y) an interaction-picture operator. Its ex-
pansion in terms of Feynman graphs is shown in Figure 13.1, where 
(p) denotes 
the proper self-energy part, which is the sum of all1PI graphs. Without taking into 
account the mass counterterm, we have 
s 1(p ) = i S F  + i S FiiS F  + i S FiiS FiiS F  + • • • 
= iS F [1. + (iI i SF) + (iSF)2  + • • .1 
= iS F (1 — 	
iS F)-1 	
(13.4) 
where we denote the electron propagator in momentum space as SF (without the 
tilde). Taking the inverse of both sides, we obtain 
(i S') -1  =  (1—  iZiS F)(iS F)-1  = [(iS F )-1  — i2 ]  
= — 40 — m + I(P)] 	
(13.5) 
where we have left the  ij  term in the denominator understood. 
To include the mass counterterm, we make the replacement i 	
i SF ± 
iSF i mi SF in all the Feynman graphs. This means that X (p ) now depends on 
6m,  and that it is replaced by 
(p) +  6m.  Consequently we have (S') -1  — — 
m +  +6m  + (p), or 
(p) =  
	
(13.6) 
— m + m + 
(p) 
By Lorentz invariance, we can write 
(p) in the form 
Z(./9 ) = A(P 2) + (0 — m)B(P2) 	
(13.7) 
Thus

73 Perturbative Renormalization 
Mass renormalization consists of the assertion that the pole of the full propagator 
is located at m. Therefore 
A(m 2) + m = 0 	
(13.9) 
Since A(m2) is divergent, this shows that 6m  must be divergent 
Another divergent quantity is B(m 2), and it is customary to put 
238 
so that Z2 —> 0. However, we regard it as an infinite series in q, with divergent 
coefficients. At the mass pole we have

This shows that/Z2  is the renormalization constant for electron wave functions. 
To verify this explicitly, we examine the self-energy insertions on an external elec-
tron line. The Feynman graphs in this case are the same as those in Figure 13.1, 
except that the left-most line is taken to be an external line. The sum of the graphs 
give

(13.13) 
Therefore 
Di(p) = Z2 u(p) 	
(13.14) 
We have shown that the wave function renormalization constant is ,-,/Z2. There-
fore, a factor ,/Z 2  goes towards the renormalization of the vertex that absorbs this 
particle. 
We have yet to show that the electron propagator is finite after mass and wave 
function renormalization. To do this we first analyze the skeleton self-energy graph. 
Later, we shall discuss how to make insertions. The skeleton is just the second-
order proper self-energy graph:

The result of mass and wave function renormalization to second order can be 
summarized by the statement 
where 
Z2 
 
S' (p) = 
(Pi — in) + Ic(P) 
X(p) = z(p) — z(po) 
(13.25) 
(13.26) 
where p o  is a 4-momentum on mass shell. It remains to be shown that this form 
is correct to all orders. 
Mass renormalization first made its appearance in Lorentz's calculation of the 
self-force of the classical electron. Lorentz modeled the electron as a spherically 
symmetric uniform charge distribution of radius a. The self-force F s  is the sum 
of all the forces between charge elements, with retardation taken into account. 
In the limit a —›- 0, the result is [1] 
F, = — 4. f dedet  + 2e2 V + 0(a)

4yrr

(13.27) 
The first term, which arises from the Coulomb self-energy, is divergent. The 
second term is independent of a, and gives the famous radiation damping of a. 
The other terms vanish when a —> 0. The equation of motion for an electron of 
"mechanical mass" mo  is 
moil =  Fe  xt + Fs 	
(13.28) 
where Fext  is the external force. When a --* 0, this has the form 
where

is the renormalized mass, to be taken from experiments. The self-energy di- 
verges like a-1  classically, but only logarithmically in QED. The difference can 
be attributed to the presence of the Dirac sea of negative-energy electrons [2, 3]. 

13.3 Vacuum Polarization I 241 
13.3 
Vacuum Polarization 
We can take the free photon propagator to be 
ory, 
DIv (k) =— b
k2 
(13.31) 
where, for simplicity, we have dropped the subscript F, and the i 77 term in the 
denominator. The full photon propagator is given by the series of graphs shown 
in Figure 13.2, which can be reduced to1PI components. The sum of all 1PI 
graphs, with external photon lines omitted, is called the vacuum polarization 
tensor //ilk). It describes virtual electron-positron pairs produced by a photon 
propagating in the vacuum. In terms of this tensor, we can write the full photon 
propagator in the form 
(k) = au" (k) 	
a""(k)i 
co(k)i Dfi"(k) 	
(13.32) 
Because of current conservation, or gauge invariance, we should have 
ki` 	
(k) = 11„,1 	
= 0 	
(13.33) 
We can therefore put 
= (et' k 2  — 	
kv)e,W (k 2 ) 	
(13.34) 
This form guarantees that the photon has zero mass, unless II (k 2 ) develops a pole 
at k 2  = 0, which does not happen in perturbation theory. Note that 17 (k 2 ) is defined 
with e factored out. 
To avoid a profusion of indices, we shall regard D'!" as a 4 x 4 matrix V',  with 
matrix multiplication is defined such that an upper index can be contracted only 
with an lower index. To be able to invert these matrices, we define the transverse 
and longitudinal projection operators 'P T  (k) and PL (k) as follows: 
le le  
(k) = g""

which is quadratically divergent. By (13.34), the degree of divergence of H (k 2 ) 
should be reduced by 2, and we expect the latter to be logarithmically divergent. 
But (13.44) violate gauge invariance, for kna  /7/("(k) 0 O. 
The violation of gauge invariance originates in the singular nature of the current, 
in which the electron field and its canonical conjugate are coupled at the same 
point, in a product of the form lp a (x)v) /3 (x). By reversing the order of fp and g», 
one would generate a meaningless term involving 6 3 (0). To avoid the singularity, 
we could replace the factor by V), (x c)zp ii(x — E), and take the limit E 
0 
eventually; but to make the product gauge invariant, we have to amend it further 
and take the current to be 
= eo-p(x 	
E ) y  o x  o e ieo fxx-±6E  dYrA y (Y) 	
(13.45) 
with c —> O. This procedure is called the "point-splitting method," and will yield a 
gauge-invariant vacuum polarization tensor [4]. 
We use the following shortcut, which yields the correct answer. By (13.34), we 
can calculate H (k) through the relation 
1 
4,11 (k 2) =  	
(k) 
3k 2  
(13.46) 
To ensure  H(0) = 0, we replace the above by 
411 (k 2) = 3 1k2  [H1 (k) — /MO)] 	
(13.47) 
The subtraction reduces the quadratic divergence to a logarithmic one. Explicitly, 
we have

73.8 Renormalization to All Orders 
It is important to note that the renormalized charge e depends only on the photon 
renormalization constant  Z3,  and does not depend on how the electron propagator 
or the vertex renormalizes. This is because Z1  =  Z2,  as guaranteed by the Ward 
identity. Because of this fact, Z3 is universal. If we bring in other charged fields 
into the system, such as nucleons or pi mesons, then Z3 will acquire contribution 
from all fields through vacuum polarization, but it will be the common charge 
renormalization constant for all fields. 
13.8 
Renormalization to All Orders 
We now describe the renormalization program of Dyson and Ward [5, 6], following 
a version due to Gell-Mann and Low [7]. The first item of business is to specify 
how SE and vertex parts are to be reinserted into a skeleton graph. Consider first 
the vertex part. We regard the skeleton A; as a functional of the free electron 
propagator S, the free photon propagator D, and the free vertex  y:  
Sum of skeleton vertex graphs .=• A 7,[S, D,  y:  eo, p, p'] 	 (13.83) 
It also depends on the bare charge e0  and external momenta p, p' as parameters. 
With this notation, we can write 
A 1,(p, p') = A[S' , D', T; eo, p, 	
(13.84) 
That is, A i, is obtainable from A 7, by inserting the full propagators S', D' in place 
of the free propagators S, D, and full vertex T in place of the free vertex  y:  The 
skeleton 4,*( [S, D, y; e o, p, p'] is only logarithmically divergent; but /1 1, is much 
more divergent, due to the insertions. 
For the electron self-energy, there is an ambiguity known as an "overlapping di-
vergence", as illustrated in Figure 13.6. It is not clear whether A should be regarded 
as an insertion into B, or the other way round. We avoid this problem by using the 
Ward-Takahashi identity to expresses S' in terms of the vertex: 
[s/(p) -  
—7-1 
=[s ,
(p0)] 	
+ (P Po) Tp(P,  Po) 
(13.85) 
The right-hand side is actually independent of po , but for definiteness we take po  to 
be a 4-momentum on mass shell. Mass renormalization consists of the statement 
[S I  (pod 
1  = 	
— 	
(13.86) 
Figure 13.6 An overlapping divergence. 
249 

13 Perturbative Renormalization 
The photon self-energy also contains overlapping divergences. To circumvent 
them, we mimic the Ward identity by defining an auxiliary function W ,u(k) by 
differentiating the inverse photon propagator: 
a 
 
W(k) 	
[i 	
(k)i — 	
(13.87) 
a 
Using (13.43), we can write 
WIL (k) = 2ik,„ — ik,„T(k) 	
(13.88) 
where 
k"  a 
 
T (k) = k2 	
[k 2  411(k)] 
(13.89) 
We then define the skeleton of T, denoted by T* , by removing all SE, vertex, as 
well as Wp  insertions. The skeleton is logarithmically divergent, and we can again 
isolate the divergence through one subtraction. To recover D' from Iya  , use the 
formula 
{iD i(k)] 	
fo
i dx 	
Wi.,(xk) 	
(13.90) 
An ambiguity occurs in the definition of the skeleton of T, due to the fact that the 
external momentum k can be routed through a graph in more than one way. The 
difficulty occurs in graphs of  W1,  containing at least 3 closed electron loops, and 
are therefore at least of order 44 , but can be overcome by the proper convention 
for momentum routing [8]. 
The reason that divergences in perturbation theory can be absorbed into renor-
malized coupling constants is that the effective coupling constant at one energy 
scale can be related to the at any other energy scale. This property depends on the 
scaling properties the insertions, which lie at the heart of renormalizability. 
The graphs in A* are all of even order, and a graph of order 2n contains factors 
of eo , S, D and y to various powers, as indicated schematically below:

p, p i ] 	(13.94)

7-2*n 	
e(2)11 s2r1+0 y2n-P c1(21:1C,„)1—a 	
(13.95) 
where u is an integer that receives an additive contribution 1 from each differ-
entiation of an electron line, and 0 from that of a photon line. Under the scale 
transformation (13.92) supplemented by 2 i 2 i

Therefore a second scaling law is 
b-1 T [S, D, y

b —l eo , 
(13.97) 
The functions S', D',  and I" satisfy the following coupled functional equations:

[D'(k)]-1  = f dx 	
\V„(xk) 	
(13.98) 
The solutions to these equations are divergent, because the functionals A* and T* 
have skeletal divergences. However, they are only logarithmically divergent, and 
can be made finite through one subtraction. Using the abbreviations A* (p, p') 
and T* (k) for the functionals, we define two finite functionals by')  
21 : (P Pi) —= A.;'; (P ,  P f ) 	
[A7, (Po ,  Pô) do=in 
(k) 	
T* (k) — T* (y) 	
(13.99) 
where ,u is an arbitrary reference momentum, and p o  momentum of an electron 
on mass shell, with 4, = m2 . The subscript pp =- al instructs us to commute Oo  
all the way to the right, and then replace it by m. Thus, 
[A (Po ,  Pod 	
= LYv 	
(13.100) 
where L is a power series in e(2)  with logarithmically divergent coefficients. The 
same is true of T* (y). 
By replacing A*, T*  respectively by 21*,T 
we have from (13.98) a set of fi-
nite functional equations. The renormalized functions 
1:k-7 are defined as 
solutions to these finite equations, with eo  replaced by an appropriately defined 
6) For simplicity we have chosen to subtract 17„ at a mass-shell momentum p o . Actually the 
subtraction can be made at any momentum, whose invariant mass would then serve as an extra 
renormalization parameter in addition to p.

The normalization of 15 is such that

(13.105) 
To complete the renormalization scheme, we show that the renormalized quan-
tities are proportional to the unrenormalized ones. Note that -t,„ can be rewritten 
as follows:

This explicitly shows the connection between the unrenormalized and renormal-
ized quantities. 
The system of functional equations is a formal property of perturbation expan-
sions. There is no guarantee that the expansions converge, or that the  function-
ais  actually exist mathematically. Our best indication that the process makes some 
sense is still the good agreement between perturbation theory and experiments. 
13.9 
Callan-Symanzik Equation 
Under a change of scale, the running coupling constant changes according to 
e2 (u 2) e 2oz(,it 2 )  
(13.112) 
where the renormalization constant Z(u 2 ) depends on the cutoff A,  the electron 
mass m, and the bare coupling e,2:).  = e2  (A 2). It can only depend on the ratios ,u 2/A 2  
and m 2 /A 2 , because it is dimensionless. In a more general discussion, we would 
treat the mass as another running coupling constant; but here we shall assume 
,u 2  » m2  and set m = 0. Thus we rewrite the above relation in the form 
( /2 2 
ct (itt 2) 	
a(A2) z

or, putting x =  ,u 2  and y = A 2 ,

Differentiating both sides with respect to x at fixed y, and then setting y = x, we 
obtain

aZ(x, a) 
/3(a) = a 	
 
ax 
(13.116) 
The function [3(a) is the "/3-function", also called the Gell-Mann—Low function [9]. 
It generates scale transformations called "renormalization group" transformations. 
The  /3-function of QED to lowest order in perturbation theory, can be obtained from 
(13.63): 
a2 
( a ) =- 
(13.117) 
Since this is positive, the coupling grows at high energies, and consequently we 
cannot investigate the high-energy behavior of QED using perturbation theory. In 
quantum chromodynamics on the other hand, the /3-function is negative at small 
coupling, and thus the coupling vanishes at high energies — a behavior known as 
asymptotic freedom. 
An important property of the  /3-function is that it depends only on a. We can 
obtain the running coupling constant a (x) by integrating (13.115) to obtain 
fa 2  da 	
, x 2  
	
 = 
— 
Ja,  /3(a) 
(13.118) 
where a 2  = a (x2), a l  = a (xi ). This equation expresses the essence of renormal 
ization: A dimensionless coupling constant at one energy scale can be related to that at 
another energy scale, without reference to any intrinsic scale. This means that there is 
nothing special about the cutoff; it is just a scale like any other. Where /3(a) = 0, 
the value of a is at a fixed point, where it remains invariant under scale changes. 
These fixed points define possible quantum field theories, and are therefore physi- 
cally interesting. We shall take up this subject in Chapter 16. 
We can abstract from QED a general property of renormalizable field theories. 
Let G' (p; A, g o) be an renormalized correlation function, which is generally di-
vergent, and depends on a high-momentum cutoff A. The external momenta are 
collectively denoted by p, and go  is a dimensionless coupling constant at the energy 
scale A. Renormalizability means that 
Op; A, g o ) = Z(A I ,u, go)G(p; ,u, g) 
g = g(A /,u, go) 	
(13.119) 
254 
where g is the renormalized coupling at the energy scale ,u. The renormalized cor-
relation function G is assumed to be a finite function of its arguments. The cutoff 

255 
13.10 Triviality 
dependence is isolated in the dimensionless renormalization constant Z. We as-
sume that 1u and p are much greater than the particle masses, which have been 
neglected . Since the left side of the equation is independent of u , so must be the 
right side. Thus, we can write 
.= 0

Triviality 
Landau [12] noted that, by calculating the renormalized charge using a plausible 
partial summation of Feynman graphs, one arrives at the conclusion that it vanish-
es in the limit of infinite cutoff. He concluded that this is absurd, and invalidates 
quantum field theory, which should be "buried with due honors." In hindsight, this 
is a tempest in a teapot. 
We can derive Landau's result as follows. Substituting (13.117) into (13.118), with 
a 2  = a(A 2 ) and a l  = a(k 2), we obtain

This is "triviality".

13 Perturbative Renormalization 
Similar perturbative calculations also point to triviality for scalar 0 4  theory. (See 
Problem 13.4.) The conclusion for 0 4  theory is supported by numerical calcula-
tions, and can be established more rigorously, as we shall show in Chapter 17. The 
result for QED is plausible though not proven; but even if proven it hardly invali-
dates quantum field theory. 
To view this alarming result in proper light, we have to understand what renor-
malization is really about, and we shall explain that in Chapter 17. In the meantime, 
we offer the following observations: 
e Trivial .ty has no impact on practical applications, because the renormalized 
charge is insensitive to A, because it goes like (ln A )'. One can choose a fi-
nite value of A to fit experiments. This is no different from what we do in QED, 
where we take the mass and charge from experiments. In doing so, we are fixing 
the cutoff at some value, not necessarily infinity. 
e A notion behind renormalization is that we can hold the renormalized charge 
fixed at an arbitrary value, and "send the cutoff to infinity". We shall see in 
Chapter 16 that sending the cutoff to infinity means approach a fixed point of 
the renormalization group. We can adopt an arbitrary value of the renormalized 
charge only if the fixed point is an "ultraviolet fixed-point", as in a theory with 
asymptotic freedom. When the theory is governed by an "infrared fixed-point", 
as is the case for 0 4  theory, the renormalized charge approaches the value at the 
fixed-point, as the cutoff goes to infinity, and that value happens to be zero. 
• QED appears to be a theory of the infrared type. However, the mathematical 
QED is only an approximation to the a "real" theory. As we know, it is embedded 
in the standard model, which in turn may be embedded in some grand unified 
theory yet unknown.

Problem 13.5 Neutron-proton mass difference [13,14] 
Since the proton is charge whereas the neutron is neutral, one might expect the 
proton to be heavier because of the electromagnetic self-energy; but in fact the 
opposite is true. To understand this, one must include the magnetic self-energy 
due to the anomalous magnetic moment. This can be done phenomenologically 
through the Pauli term described in Problem 12.3:

Path Integrals 
14.1 
Path integrals in Quantum Mechanics 
Quantum mechanics is based on the commutation relation between the momen-
tum operator p op  and the coordinate operator q op  at equal times, say t = 0: 
[Pop, got)] 	
(14.1) 
In the Heisenberg picture, the coordinate operator at time t is given by 
qop(t) 	
eiHt qope—iHt 	
(14.2) 
where H is the Hamiltonian operator. If q') denotes the eigenstate of q op  with 
eigenvalue  q',  then the eigenstate of q op (t') with the same eigenvalue is given by 
I

(14.3) 
The transition amplitude defined by 
(e rig / t t) 	
( q t l e-iH(C-t 1)10 	
(14.4) 
contains a complete description of the quantum mechanical system. Through the 
Feynman path integral [1], we can express this amplitude in terms of the classical 
Lagrangian, and thus obtain an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics that 
makes no reference to a Hilbert space. 
Assume t" > t'. To derive the path-integral representation, we break up the time 
interval t" — t' into N equal pieces, and use the identity

Next replace (q'ITIq) by the mixed matrix element (pIT1q), by inserting complete

A classical Hamiltonian H(p, q) can be defined through the relation 
(p1H1q) 	
(plq)H(p, q) 	
(14.13) 
To obtain H(p, q), we pull all the p op  occurring in H to the far left, commuting 
across the qop  if necessary, and then replace them by the number p. Thus, 
(pITIq) = (pig) [1— i H(p, q)d] 	
(14.14) 
and we define 
T(p, q)---._ 1 — iH(p, q).4

in which the time advancement is now effected by T(p, q), a c-number. The crucial 
step towards obtaining the final result is to make the replacement 
T(p, q) —>- e—iH( P'cl)A 	
(14.17) 
which becomes exact in the limit A 
—> 0. The purpose is to make T(p, q) a unitary 
transformation over the finite time interval A. Putting (p I q) = exp(ip q), we obtain 
"1 	
t') = 	
fp  exp

— H(pi, qi)A] 
1=1 
(14.18) 
We can think of  {pi'  q 1 } as successive samplings of a path in phase space at 
equal time intervals A, and the whole path fp (t), q(t)} is covered when A 
—> 0. In 
that limit (gi_i — q i)/ A becomes the velocity q(t), and the integrals over qi and p 
become functional integrals: 
DqDp exp 
dt [p(t)g(t) — H (p(t), q(t)d} 
(14.19) 
263 
where the limits of integration denote the endpoint 
q(e) =  g' 
g(t") = g" 
The measures of the functional integration are given by 
(14.20) 
(14.21) 
which, however, do not have well-defined limits when A 
—> 0. For this reason, 
we retain the discrete time steps for all intermediate computations, and take the 
desired limit only in the final answer. 
Assume that the classical Hamiltonian has the form 
2 
H(p, q) =  	
V(q) 
2 rn 
(14.22) 
We can then perform the momentum integrations in (14.19) to obtain the final 
result

The representation (14.23) is the Feynman path integral. It gives the transition am-
plitude as a "sum over histories" — a sum over all possible paths leading from the 
initial to the final state, weighted by i times the classical action of the path. 
An illustration of a Feynman path is shown in Figure 14.1. The integration over 
all paths means integrating the coordinate q ( t ),) at the nth time step over all possi-
ble values, independently for all n. In the limit A —> 0, the limiting paths q(t) are 
generally discontinuous, but they must be single-valued. 
14.2 
Time-ordering 
Consider the following matrix element of coordinate operators: 
(q", t" qop (t2 )qop (ti )lq' , t')

74.3 Imaginary Time 
265 
where t" > t'. If t 2  > t 1 , we can proceed with the same treatment as before. The 
only difference is that, when complete sets of coordinate eigenstates are inserted, 
we will pick up a factor of the eigenvalue q (t2)q (4). If t 2  < ti , on the other hand, 
we would be faced with multivalued paths. (See Problem 14.1.) In physical theories, 
however, correlation functions are always time-ordered, and we have the result 
q" 
(q",  t" IT qop (t2)qop (ti)Iq' , t') =

14.3 
Imaginary Time 
The time in the transition amplitudes can be analytically continued to pure imag-
inary values. In this domain the integrand of the path integral is real instead of 
pure imaginary, and this makes it convenient for some computations. The pure-
imaginary time is called "Euclidean time", because it converts Minkowskian space-
time to a 4-dimensional Euclidean space. 
Let us go back to (14.4) at the beginning, and insert a complete set of energy 
eigenstates: 
f(t) 	
(q", 	
t') = (q" Ie Ht l q') 
— E( quin) (n1q1) e— E, t 	
(14.28) 
n 
where t = t" — 
, and the n-th eigenstate defined by 
H In) = En in) 
E0  = 0 	
(14.29) 
The energy spectrum is bounded from below by assumption. We can therefore 
analytically continue f (t) to negative imaginary time 
t = —it 
(r > 0) 	
(14.30) 
The result may be written 
f(-ir) 	e _Eu r

where  p(q) is the wave function of the n-th eigenstate. The oscillatory terms are 
now replaced by damped exponentials. For example, we can extract the energy

We enclose the system in a large periodic box, and introduce a high-momentum 
cutoff A,  so that the number of degrees of freedom finite. The path-integral for-
mulation can be taken over from that in quantum mechanics. We can view 0 (x) as 
a coordinate labeled by x, and denote the eigenstate of 0 (x) by 10'). The eigenstate 
of the Heisenberg operator q)(x, t) is then

The path integral extends over all such fields with the specified endpoints. Note 
that there is no longer a distinction between upper and lower indices on ai . For 
infinite time interval, rit  — r' -->  oc,  we write 
SE[]  = f dd x E

(14.48) 
It is assumed that the initial and final constraints become irrelevant in this limit.

We will omit the subscript E on Euclidean quantities when the context makes it 
unnecessary. 
14.6 
Vacuum Amplitudes 
We have obtained path integrals for transition amplitudes between field eigen-
states. For practical calculations, however, it is more convenient to work with am-
plitudes taken between vacuum states. To derive path integrals for the latter, we 
first couple the field to an external source J(x, t), which is switched on and off adi-
abatically: 
J(x, t) 	0 	
(14.51) 
The classical Lagrangian density becomes 
Li  (x, t) = L(x, t) — J(x, t)10 (x, t) 	
(14.52) 

74.6 Vacuum Amplitudes

amplitude with respect to J(x) will insert a factor —i (x) in the integrand. Thus

We now show that the vacuum correlation function can be obtained by letting t' 
—oo, and t" --> oo. 
Assume for simplicity that the external source is present only during a finite but 
large time interval T: 
J(x) = 0 
for 
tj > T 	
(14.55) 
Eventually, we shall take the limit T 	
oo. Consider the transition amplitude 
(02, tzlçbi, ti ) j  for t 1  before the source was turned on, and t2  after the source was 
turned off. Assuming that the eigenstates of the field form a complete set at any 
time t, we have 
f D010,0(0, ti = 1 
Thus, for t 1  < — T, t2  > T, we can write 
(02> t2101, t 1 )1 
f
DOD0 1 (02, t210, T)(0, TIOI, — n1(01,-11101 ,  ti) 	(14.56) 
The amplitudes (0 2 , t21
, T) and (0f, —T110 1 , t1)  pertain to source-free time in- 
tervals, and may be calculated as in the following example: 
(02 ,  t210 ,  T) = (21e—t2—T)1) 	
(02In) (nkb)e —i E„(t2—T) 	
(14.57) 
where we have inserted a complete set of energy eigenstates, with vacuum state 
satisfying  H10) = O. To it pick out, we go to the limit of large imaginary t2  — T, so 
that contributions from all other states are damped out: 
( (/52, t210, T) 	(0 2 10) (OW 	
(14.58) 
In the original amplitude, then, let us make t

(14.60) 
where H1  is the total Hamiltonian in the presence of source, and (0+101 j  is the 
vacuum to vacuum amplitude in the presence of source discussed in Section 10.4. 
We can now write for this amplitude: 
(0+ 1 0—)j = lim

(14.61) 
In taking the limit of large imaginary time, the real part of the time is kept arbitrary. 
All this does is to make sure that oscillating phases damp out. Using (14.53) to 
rewrite the right side above in terms of path integrals, we have 
(0+10—)= f Doeis[oi—iu,o) 
f DOeis[01 
where (J, 0) = f  d dxJ(x)0(x). Taking functional derivatives of both sides, we

Statistical Mechanics 
As (14.65) shows, there is a similarity between a vacuum correlation function in 
path-integral form and an ensemble average in statistical mechanics. In fact, in 
Euclidean space-time the generating functional (14.66) is just the logarithm of the 
partition function in the presence of an external field:

where S[0] is the Euclidean action (14.48), with subscript E suppressed, and

is an integral over Euclidean space. In statistical mechanics, we would make the 
identification 
S []  = 
E[0] 
(14.68) 
where E[0] is the energy functional of a classical field 
(x), and  3 is the inverse

ating functional:

Q 
(14.69) 
where Q is the volume of the d-dimensional space. Like the generating functional, 
it is determined only up to an additive constant. 
We see that (14.67) gives on the one hand the generating functional for a quan-
tum field theory in d space-time dimensions, and on the other hand the parti-
tion function for a classical field in d spatial dimensions. This is a special case of 
an equivalence between quantum field theory and quantum statistical mechanics, 
based on a correspondence between imaginary time and inverse temperature:

On the left, the Hamiltonian H appears as the generator of the Lie group of time 
translations. On the right, the same operator appears in the Boltzmann weight in 
a statistical ensemble. The deeper reason for this correspondence remains one of 
the great mysteries in physics. 
For practical use of the correspondence, consider a quantum field at absolute 
temperature )8-1, in d — 1 spatial dimensions. Denote the field by 
(x, r), where 
(x, r) denotes Euclidean space-time coordinates. We use field eigenstates I 
) as a 
basis to calculate the partition function (with no external field):

where lp (x) denotes a time-independent field. The matrix element in the integrand 
above is a transition amplitude with the same initial and final state. We can write it 
as a path integral in Euclidean-time:

where 7- (0 (x, r)) is the Hamiltonian density, and Q is the volume of the (d — 1)- 
dimensional spatial box. To obtain the partition function, we integrate over the 
initial field 'zp (x). This removes the restrictions to particular initial and final fields, 
but the initial field is still constraint to be equal to the final field. Thus

In the limit Q —>  oc,  we recognize this as the generating functional of a Euclidean 
quantum field theory, (at absolute zero,) in a flat box of thickness [3, with periodic 
boundary conditions required along the short edge. Along the long edges, which 
eventually tend to infinite length, we normally impose periodic boundary condi-
tions anyway. The box is depicted in Figure 14.2. In the limit of infinite tempera-
tures (0 —> 0) the volume flattens to a box in d — 1dimensions, and we recover the 
classical system mentioned earlier. In the limit of absolute zero (/3 —>  oc)  we have 
a quantum field theory in d Euclidean dimensions. 
In statistical mechanics, there is the Ginsburg-Landau theory, in which the parti-
tion function has the form 
z=fpoe—/3  E[o 	
(14.74) 
where 0(x) is a classical field enclosed in a d-dimensional volume. One imagines 
that this was obtained by summing over all variables in a microscopic partition 
sum, while keeping a certain "order parameter" 
(x) fixed. This order parameter 
characterizes phase transitions. It vanishes at the critical point of a second-order 
phase transition, and in the neighborhood of such a point one can expand the

Figure 14.2 A flat box in d dimensions, of

function in path-integral form describes either

sion (d — 1) at temperaturel3-1.

where the parameter a, r, u, • • • are phenomenological quantities that may depend 
on the temperature. The functional fi E[0] is called the Landau free energy. In this 
fashion, the theory gives a macroscopic description of phase transitions, yielding 
phase diagrams and critical exponents. We see that the Ginsburg-Landau theory al-
so gives a quantum field theory. The significance of the critical point will be discuss 
in more detail in Chapter 16.

The correlation functions in the unperturbed system can be calculated using Wick's 
theorem: 
(0 (xi ) • • • 0 (x,))0 = Sum of all possible pairings 	
(14.109) 
where the average 0 0  is taken with respect to S0[0], and "pairing" means a group-
ing of all members of the set Içb (xi ), • • • , (x n )} into distinct pairs, with each pair 
contributing a factor 
(x)0 (y) = E(% — y) 
I 	 I 	
(14.110) 
We now outline different methods to get a perturbation expansion for the parti-
tion function. The most straightforward is an expansion in powers of Si  [0]:

(14.111) 
The quantity inside the average 0 0  can be expanded as an infinite series in 0(x), 
and the average calculated using Wick's theorem. This gives an expansion in terms 
of Feynman graphs for Z[J], and we get a sum of connected graphs when we cal-
culate ln Z[J]. The constant Z (°)[0] then becomes an irrelevant additive constant. 

278 
14 Path Integrals 
An alternative method is to use the "cumulant expansion". In its generic form, 
this gives an expansion ofln (ex ) in terms of the moments (xn), and works for any 
definition of the average (). It is straightforward to write down the expansion: 
ln(ex) = ln 	
(xni

= (x) + -2 [(x 2) ( x) 2] + -6 [(x 3 ) 
3 (x)(x 2) + ( x) 3] + 
(14.112) 
To apply this to the partition function, we write 
Z[J] = »NO] (e- s' [°]- (-14))o 	
(14.113) 
Thus, 
in  Z[ J] = ln ZO 1 [0] + (A) + -21  [(A2 ) 0  - ( A),2)] + • • • 	
(14.114) 
where A =  -*{Si[]  + (J, çb)}. This will generate connected Feynman graphs for 
correlation functions. 
Another method is to regard the interaction Hamiltonian as a function of 0(x), 
and write 
7-t1 (x) = V (0(x)) 	
(14.115) 
even though it may depend on 80(x). The partition function may be expanded in 
powers of  Si[],  and further developed as follows:

14.10 The Loop Expansion 1 279 
14.10 
The Loop Expansion 
Connected Feynman graphs can be classified according to the number of closed 
loops in the graph. For any connected Feynman graph, let 
n = No. of vertices 
I = No. of internal lines 
E = No. of external lines 	
(14.118) 
Each internal line carries an internal momentum that is integrated over. Not all the 
internal momenta are independent, on account of momentum conservation; but 
each closed loop can be associated with a loop momentum, and thus the number 
of loops is equal to the number of independent internal momenta. To find this 
number, we note that each vertex imposes one condition of momentum conser-
vation, and there is one condition of overall momentum conservation. Thus, the 
number of independent internal momentum is 
= I — n + 1 	
(14.119) 
which is equal to the number of loops. 
Now consider the power of h multiplying a Feynman graph. We can find this 
number by examination of (14.117). Each vertex comes with a factor h-1 , since it 
comes from a factor h 
V. Each internal line results from an application of h Id J 
twice to  Z0 [ J] = C expU, zl E J)/2h] to bring down a factor h-1 Z1 E. Thus it comes 
with a factor h. Thus, when external lines are ignored, a connected graph is propor-
tional to 
hl—n+1 = h 	
(14.120) 
where a term +1 is added to the exponent because the generating functional is 
h ln Z. In the classical limit h —> 0, we have only tree graphs — graphs with no 
closed loops. The first quantum correction is given by one-loop graphs, etc. 
As h —> 0, we can calculate the partition function 
Z[J] = f D e—Osloi+u,o)} 	
(14.121) 
through a saddle-point expansion. Suppose the exponent in the integrand has an

This is a saddle point, on the assumption that 5[0] is analytic, and therefore cannot 
have an absolute maximum or minimum. To carry out this out, it is convenient to 
redefine the variable of integration as 0 + 00 , and write

h 
(14.126) 
where we have dropped a J-independent constant. It should be noted that 0 0  and 
Q are functionals of J. In this expansion, the first term comes from tree graphs, the 
second term from one-loop graph, and the 0(h) term represents 2 or more loop 
contributions. Applications of this formula can be found in Section 15.7. 
14.11 
Boson and Fermion Loops 
We have seen in Chapter 11, in particular (11.62), that a closed fermion loop carries 
an extra minus sign, because fermion operators anticommute. The point is that a 
closed fermion loop is the result of a contraction of the form 
vivj tp2 
(14.127) 

14.77 Boson and Fermion Loops 
To write this as a product of two  fermion propagators, we reverse the order of ip 
thus getting a minus sign. Fermions are set apart from bosons just by a minus 
sign. In the wave function of a many-particle system, the minus sign occurs in the 
signature of a permutation of two particles. In Feynman graphs, the minus sign 
occurs in closed loops. 
To illustrate this difference, let us compare free boson and fermion theories, 
coupled to external field in such a manner that all Feynman graphs are one-loop 
graphs. Consider the classical Lagrangian density 
L(x) = aP v)* aIp — m 2 1»*

(14.130) 
(14.131) 
where K = _a2 ± m2. To quantize lp as a boson field, we write the path-integral 
representation for the generating functional:

Grassmann Variables 
We may look upon a general Gaussian integral as a way to represent the reciprocal 
of a determinant. The question is how to represent a determinant. Let us go back 
to an elementary Gaussian integral. We want to define variables y* and y, and a

sense of integration, such that we can write 
f cly* dw A u *  'I = A 	
(14.137) 
Clearly this is impossible if y* and y are ordinary numbers; but it is possible if 
they are Grassmann variables, which are anticommuting objects defined in the 
following fashion. 
Consider first two Grassmann variables /7 1  and 17 2 , defined by the relations 
2 	
2 
171 =  172 = 
112} = 0 	
(14.138) 
This is different from fermion creation and annihilation operators because the anti-
commutator is always zero. The most general function of two Grassmann variables 
must be linear in each: 
f(ii 1, 772) = CO ± C1/71 ± C2 172 ± C3 )71/12 	
(14.139) 
where Ci is a complex number. We now define integration to mean 
f  d=0  f dy 2  = 0 
f dy i y i  = 1 f d77 2 7 2  = 1 	
(14.140)

/7 1  and /7 2 . Thus,

To get (14.137), we must therefore take y and ri* to be two independent Grassmann

Suppose there are an even number 2N of variables. We divide them into two sets, 
label one set {y } and the other 07„*I. The asterisk here merely serves as a distin-
guishing label, and does not denote conjugation of any sort. We form the quadratic 
form 
X = 1.:17A upy/3 	
(y*Ay)

where A a/3  is a real symmetric matrix. Through a linear transformation, we can 
diagonalize A, and obtain 
X =

When we integrating over all the Grassmann variables, only the last term survives, 
because all other terms must have at least one integral of the form f d y, which 
vanishes. Thus, 
f

where there are N factors. In the expansion of this quantity, no y may appear twice 
in a one term. Therefore a typical term in the expansion is obtained by choosing 
one term from each factor, which gives 11 A  a17a*ria.  The total number of terms in 
the expansion is the number of ways to one term from each factor, or N!. Thus,

possibility that the membrane might fold over itself, we take 0(x, y) to be single-
valued, and take the energy to be proportional to the area of the membrane: 
E[0] =  of  dxdy,/g

Problem 14.8 Anderson localization 
The Anderson localization problem is the study of a single non-relativistic particle 
moving among "impurities", modeled as a random potential. The single-particle 
Hamiltonian is 
v2 
H = — —
2m + V(r) 
where V( r) is the random potential. That is, V( r) is one member of a suitably cho-
sen ensemble of potentials, and physical properties are to be averaged over this 
ensemble. The difficulty of this task will call for exotic methods, and turn this one-
particle problem into one of interacting boson and fermion fields. In particular, the 
fermion field is a Grassmann variable introduced to give a convenient representa-
tion of a certain determinant.

Broken Symmetry 
15.1 
Why Broken Symmetry 
When the Hamiltonian of a system is invariant under a symmetry operation, but 
the ground state is not, we say that the symmetry is spontaneously broken. By ap-
plying the symmetry operation to the ground state, we transformed it to a different 
but equivalent ground state. Thus, the ground state is degenerate, and in the case 
of a continuous symmetry, infinitely degenerate. The actual ground state of the 
system, of course, can only be one of these degenerate states. 
Let the degenerate ground states be denoted la).  In the case of broken contin-
uous symmetry, a is a continuous label, and we can construct a state l a (x)) that 
coincides with different ground states at different points in space in a continuous 
manner. This state is orthogonal to the true ground state, and, in the limit of in-
finitely slow variation of a (x), a state of vanishing excitation energy. This is an 
intuitive picture of the Goldstone mode, an excitation whose energy vanishes in the 
limit of zero momentum. In a relativistic system with no long-range interactions, 
one can prove that such a mode corresponds to a zero-mass particle called the Gold-
stone boson. (See Problem 15.4.) In a ferromagnet, the Goldstone mode corresponds 
to spin waves, as we shall show later. 
Broken symmetry is ubiquitous in nature. For example, a solid has rigidity be-
cause the atoms occupy fixed positions, breaking translational invariance. When 
you kick a stone, no doubt remains in your mind about this quality' )  — as forceful-
ly demonstrated by Dr. Johnson in his famous retort to Bishop Berkeley" ) . In the 
breaking of translational invariance, the Goldstone mode corresponds to acoustic 
phonons. Less obvious is the breaking of gauge symmetry, manifested in Bose—
Einstein condensation. This appears to be the most prevalent form of symmetry

10)From James Boswell's Life of Johson, edited by 
M. Waingrow (Edinburgh University Press,

1763): After we came out of the Church 
we stood talking for some time together of 
Bishop Berkeley's ingenious sophistry to 
prove the nonexistence of matter, and that 
every thing in the Universe is merely ideal. 
I observed that though we are satisfied his 
doctrine is not true it is impossible to refute 
it. I never shall forget the alacrity with which 
Johnson answered, striking his foot with

breaking in nature, exhibited in such diverse phenomena as superfluidity, super-
conductivity, mass for elementary particles, and the inflation of the early universe. 
Modern pioneers in this subject include Anderson, Nambu and Jona-Lasinio, and 
Goldstone [2-4]. 
It may seem puzzling that broken symmetry can occur at all. Consider a fer-
romagnet, where rotational symmetry is allegedly broken, through the fact that all 
the atomic spins point along the same direction. However, rotational invariance im-
plies that all directions of the total spin are equally probable, and its average over 
a statistical ensemble should therefore be zero. This puzzle is usually resolved by 
considering the spin density S(B, Q) in a system of volume Q,  in the presence of 
a small external magnetic field B. The point is that the limits Q oc and B 
0 
do not commute. That the ensemble average yields zero is the statement 
lim lim S(B, Q) = 0 	
(15.1) 
whereas spontaneous magnetization means 
lirn lim S(B, Q ) 	
0 
B—>-052--->co 
(15.2) 
Though mathematically useful, this formulation masks the physics. 
The physical reason for symmetry breaking is that, during its dynamical evolu-
tion, the system gets stuck for a long time in a certain pocket of states. In a ferro-
magnet, neighboring atoms prefer to have parallel spins, and if thermal agitation 
is reduced, all the spins would line up. The total spin can still freely rotate in space, 
but the rotation is very slow, because it requires the cooperative effort of a large 
number of atoms. When the number of atoms becomes macroscopically large, the 
total spin is forever stuck in a definite direction. What causes spontaneous symme-
try breaking, then, is a breakdown of ergodicity. 
A generic example of spontaneous symmetry breaking is the real 0 4  theory, with 
energy functional 
E[0] = f ex {-21 [a0(x)]2  V(0(x))} 
V(0(x)) = —r 0 2  (x)

The potential V(0) is shown in Figure 15.1. There is only one minimum at 0 = 0 
if r > 0; but there are two minima at q) 	
/—  r/).  if r < 0. From the point of 
view of statistical mechanics, the two minima q) = 	
— r1.1. are equally probable, 
and therefore the ensemble average of must be zero. The time average of 0, 
however, is not necessarily the same as the ensemble average. In the case r < 0, 
the system can go back and forth between the two minima, but the transition takes 
a long time, because it requires a simultaneous transition at all x. Based on simple 
models in statistical mechanics, one can estimate this time to be of order e .Q  , where 
Q is the total volume. Thus, ergodicity fails when Q —> co. 
The failure of ergodicity can be demonstrated through a Monte-Carlo simulation 
of the 0 4  model on a 4D Euclidean lattice [5]. As the field configuration evolves

to flip simultaneously. This is the underlying 
cause of spontaneous symmetry breaking. 
A symmetry-breaking phase transition occurs 
at r = —165. [After K. Huang, E. Manousakis, 
and J. Polonyi, Phys, Rev. 35, 3187 (1987).] 
in time by successive Monte-Carlo updates, we record the instantaneous field (0), 
averaged over all lattice sites. This is shown in Figure 15.2. for different values of r, 
with A  = 1000, for a lattice with 104  sites. We can see that there is a phase transition 
at a critical value I-, 
—165. For r > rc , the average field makes small fluctuations 
about zero. As we approach rc , the fluctuations become more pronounced, with 
(0) making flip-flops between periods of positive and negative values. The time

long, presumably of order e 104 . The average field now makes small fluctuations 
about a nonzero value.

We use the mean-field approximation, through the replacement 1,0 a lp

The mean-field Hamiltonian describes two free Fermi gases, with up and down 
spin, respectively, for which the single-particle energies are E± = (p 2/2 m)+J S. In 
the ground state, the two gases must have the same Fermi energy EF, for otherwise 
we can lower the total energy by transferring particles from one gas to the other. 
This is illustrated in Figure 15.3. Denoting the number of particles in the two gases

solutions r = ±r0  arise when J > Jc , where 
bJ, = 4 	
(15.17) 
As discussed in the last section, choosing one of these roots leads to spontaneous 
magnetization. From the form of the mean-field Hamiltonian, it is obvious that a 
symmetry-breaking solution has lower energy than the symmetric one. 
The symmetry-breaking solution exists only if b > 0, which means n > O. Thus 
it is possible in unbounded free space only in the limit N

solutions to the homogeneous equation

(15.31) 
There is always a trivial solution. A non-trivial solution will indicate the existence 
of "excited states" in the field-free system. As we shall see below, it is easy to prove 
fin = 10- 	
(15.32) 
which shows that there exist solutions at k = 0. However, these are state of constant 
density, both in space and time, and thus correspond to other ground states. For 
this reason, we might call this statement the "ground state theorem". To show the 
existence of spin waves, we must prove the "spin-wave theorem" 
(k) k 	
_>>0  1/J 	
(15.33) 
This states that there exists a Goldstone mode, a non-uniform state that joins 
smoothly onto some ground state in the long-wavelength limit. To establish this, 
all we have to do is show that II (k) is regular at k = 0. An explicit calculation of 
H(k) yields more information:

The condition  f(k) = 0 then determines a relation between 11(1 and co, the disper-

To establish (15.32), turn on a spatially uniform external field B. By rotational 
symmetry the magnetization must have the form: 
S = —B f( B 2)

Breaking Gauge Invariance 
When Kamerlingh-Onnes liquefied helium in 1908, and not long after observed 
strange behavior in liquid helium [7], and discovered superconductivity [8], (after 
trying unsuccessfully to fix what was thought to be a short-circuit [9]), he observed 
for the first time broken gauge symmetry. 
Both the strange behavior called superfluidity in liquid helium, and the super-
conductivity in certain metals, are manifestations of a Bose—Einstein condensate, 
formed by a macroscopic number of bosons in a single quantum state. The con-
densate wave function y) (x) is a complex number with a definite phase, and the 
existence of such a phase in the ground state breaks global gauge invariance — 
a symmetry associated with particle conservation. The ground state of the system 
is labeled by the phase, and hence infinitely degenerate. 
Consider a non-relativistic boson system described by a field operator @(x), 
which is denoted with a caret to distinguish it from the c-number (x). Let IN) 
be the ground state with N particles, where N eventually approaches infinity. The

macroscopic occupation of a single state is indicated by the fact that the amplitude 
to annihilate a particle at any point x is of order N 112 : 
(x) = 	
— 11@. (x)IN) = 0(N 1.12 ) 	
(15.41) 
This amplitude defines the condensate wave function. Yang [10] calls this condi-
tion "off-diagonal long-range order" (ODLRO), and proved that it is possible only 
if  W(x) is a boson field, or a product of an even number of fermion fields, but not 
for a product of an odd number of fermion fields. The distinction between 0(N) 
and 0(1) exists only in the limit N 
oo, and this underscores the fact that spon-
taneous symmetry breaking is a macroscopic phenomenon. 
Let us describe the system using states in the grand canonical ensemble, which 
are not eigenstates of particle number, but an average number N is determined by 
the chemical potential. Then the condition for ODLRO, or Bose—Einstein conden-
sation, can be stated in the form 
(x) =  (  (x)) =  0(N 112) 	
(15.42) 
where () denotes average with respect to the grand canonical ensemble. This condi-
tion was suggested much earlier by Penrose and Onsager [11], but we deviate from 
historical order in the interest of pedagogy. The condensate density is defined by 
no  = —
Q1  f d 3 Op(x)1 2 	
(15.43) 
where Q is the volume of the system. This should remain finite in the thermody-
namic limit Q —>- oo, N

To study the condensate in more detail, take the Hamiltonian to be

In physical units,

This gives the energy per particle in the condensate. 
There is an uncertainty relation between the phase 0 of a many-body wave func-
tion and the number of particles: (See Problem 15.2) 
ZIOAN> 1/2 	
(15.56) 
Thus an isolated system with a definite number of particles does not have a defi-
nite phase. If two such systems come into contact, and can exchange particles, then 
the relative phase becomes definite. Such a relative phase has been observed be-
tween two Bose condensates of sodium atoms, by Ketterle and his team at MIT [17], 
eighty-nine years after Kamerlingh-Onnes created a condensate in the laboratory. 
The interference fringes can be seen in the photograph in Figure 15.5.

deBroglie wavelength hlmv of the atoms, 
where y is the relative velocity of the two con-
densates as they approach each other. 
In quantum mechanics, the gradient of the phase of a wave function is a particle 
current density. Here, since the wave function is macroscopically occupied, the cor-
responding current density is a hydrodynamic quantity that describes superfluidity, 
the frictionless transport of particles. From the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we have 
the conservation law 
V • j 	
ap/a t = 0 	
(15.57) 
where 
V1,0 — V 
(15.58) 
In the ground state the entire system can be regarded as a superfluid at rest. When 
boundaries conditions are changed slowly, the adiabatic theorem tell us that the 
ground state changes slowly in response, and this leads to a frictionless superfluid 
flow described by j and p. Friction will occur as soon as the system can be excit-
ed from the ground state into a mode that lacks phase coherence. In the neigh-
borhood of the ground state, there is the Goldstone mode, which corresponds to 
long-wavelength phonons [18]; but they maintain the phase coherence. Vortex ex-
citations, on the other hand do disrupt phase coherence, and destroy superfluidity. 
To investigate vortices, let us put 
(x) = e' (x)  -N/ p(x) 
Then the current can be expressed as

is the "superfluid velocity". [In physical units, vs  = (h I m)V 0 •] In order that zp be 
single-valued, the phase angle 0 can change only by a multiple of 2yr over a closed 
path C in space. Therefore, the circulation of the superfluid velocity is quantized: 
(15.62) 
where n = 0, ±1, 	
If n 	
0, then C must encircle a line on which p = 0, 
for otherwise we could shrink C to a point, at which the phase angle 0 becomes 
undefined. This line of zeros is the core of a vortex with quantized vorticity, and can 
terminate only on the boundary of the system, or terminate on itself by forming a 
closed curved. 
To describe a vortex with core along the z axis, let us use cylindrical coordinates 
(r, ço, z), and put

where C is a constant. It is found that the energy is proportional to n2 . Thus, vor-
tices with 1111 > 1 need not be considered, for they will breakup into vortices with 
1n1 = 1 to lower the energy. The linear vortex described has macroscopic energy, 
since it has a linear core whose dimension is that of the box containing the system. 
Finite-energy solutions are vortex rings — those in which the vortex core forms a 
closed curve. The solution above gives an approximate picture of the flow near the 
core.

The vortex core is devoid of superfluid, and filled with particles not in the con-
densate (the ones whose field operator is 4) ,) whose effects were neglected in the 
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The core renders the space non-simply connected, and 
makes it possible to have 96c. dx.v, 0, even though v s  is the gradient of a function. 
As a simplified model, we assume that the density of the superfluid is constant, 
except that it vanishes inside vortex cores, taken to be tubes of radius a, with energy 
per unit length v. The system is then described by the energy functional 
E[v s] = —
P2°  f d 3 xv 2s  v L 	
(15.68) 
where L is the total length of vortex cores in the system. The integral f d 3  x ex-
tends over the space outside of vortex cores only. The superfluid velocity vs  is not 
irrotational, and may be decomposed it into longitudinal and transverse parts: 
Vs  = VL 
VT 
VL = 
vT =VxA 
(15.69) 
where V w describes irrotational flow, while V x A arises from vortices. Substituting 
this into (15.62) yields 
cls • V x A 	
2,7rn

(15.70) 
(the mass is m = 1.) Thus, A can be likened to the vector potential set up by steady 
currents flowing along the vortex cores. The energy functional can now be written 
as

E[vs] = 2 f

At very low temperatures, vortices are suppressed because the cores cost energy. 
The low-energy excitations are longitudinal phonons, corresponding to the Gold-
stone mode.

The superfluid density ps  is a transport coefficient that describes the response

not respond to a shear force. This analysis is described in Appendix B, and we shall 
just make use of the result here:

where D is the dimension of space, and fi the inverse temperature. The thermal 
average indicated by () is weighted by the energy functional (15.71). This indicates 
that the superfluid density differs from po  due to vortex activity represented by vT .

the space of all possible vortex cores, which form arbitrary loops in space. This 
poses an insurmountable problem. 
In contrast, the vortex cores are point-like in 2D, and the superfluid density can 
be calculated exactly, for a dilute gas of vortices. As we will show in Chapter 18, 
this gives a complete understanding of the phase transition associated with 2D 
superfluidity.

In Figure 15.7, the potential is plotted over the 0 1-0 2  plane for u 2  < 0. It has a 
"wine-bottle" shape, which makes 10 I > 0 in the ground state. In contrast to Fig-
ure 15.1, where the potential breaks a discrete symmetry, the potential minimum 
here gives a continuous set of degenerate ground states. 
The condition 101 > 0 is necessary but not sufficient for spontaneous breaking, 
which requires (0) 
O. For the latter to be true, the fluctuations of the phase 0 (x) 
of the field has to be small. Let us put

For d > 3, the fluctuations are bounded, and we expect (0)

modulo 27r. Hence we expect (0) = 0. This case will be studied separately in

o For d = 4 —  E,  we can model the ;t-transition in liquid helium at temperature 
T, by choosing u 2  = a (T — Te), where a is a constant, and T is the absolute

of c, and we extrapolate the results to c = 1. The reason we cannot do the 
calculations directly in d = 3 is that there are infrared divergences. 
e For d = 4, we have a quantum field theory with broken symmetry. This is used 
in the standard model of particles, grand unified models, and the theory of the 
inflationary universe.

Renormalization 
16.1 
The Cutoff as Scale Parameter 
In perturbation theory, we encounter divergent Feynman graphs that must be cut 
off at high momentum. The cutoff marks the energy scale at which known physics 
ends, and the unknown begins, and would be necessary even if there were no di-
vergences. It is presumed that we observe the world at an energy scale far below 
that of the cutoff, but the Lagrangian of the system is specified at the cutoff scale, 
with parameters appropriate to that scale. It would be desirable to express them 
in terms of low-energy parameters, without explicit reference to the cutoff, and 
renormalization is the means for doing that. 
To insure that we remain in the low-energy domain, we would like to take the 
cutoff to be infinite; but this cannot be done by declaration. In the absence of ex-
ternal fields, the action of the system should not contain an intrinsic energy scale 
apart from the cutoff. Thus, the cutoff disappears from the action when we reduce 
all quantities to dimensionless form. The only way to tell whether the cutoff is fi-
nite or infinite is to calculate some physical quantity with dimension, such as the 
correlation length, and the cutoff is infinite when the correlation length diverges. 
Using the terminology from condensed matter physics, we say that such a system 
is at a critical point. To approach the limit of infinite cutoff, therefore, we must 
adjust the parameters so as to make the system "go critical". Let us illustrate this 
with a concrete example.

With units such that h = c =  1, the dimensionality of any quantity can be 
expressed as a power of length, or equivalently momentum. The dimensionality of 
a quantity X, denoted by [X], can be deduced from the assertion that the action is 
dimensionless. We use the cutoff momentum A as a standard scale. The statement 
[X] = A —P 	
(16.9) 
means that X transforms like A — P under a change of scale, or that X A is dimen-
sionless. It is straightforward to verify the following:

The exponents above are the so-called "canonical dimensions". It is convenient to 
use the following dimensionless quantities:

Fourier component:

Coupling constants: 	 —d+

and the interaction term can be represented in the form 
(5 (2' q ,)(p g ,Y 6 2 0 q 3 Y9 4

We see that A has disappeared. Its value is reflected only through the coupling 
coefficients {u,}. Thus, changing the cutoff means changing  { }. 
The correlation length is defined through the asymptotic behavior of the cor-
relation function:

With all the couplings {g} 
	
by powers of the cutoff, the theory here is 
"renormalizable" in the sense of perturbation theory, for the cutoff dependence of 
(g, } supplies convergent factors in Feynman graphs. Problem 16.3 discusses the 
56 theory in d = 4 as an example.

16.2 
RG Trajectories 
We define a field theory at a certain energy scale specified by the cutoff A,  with a 
set of coupling coefficients u, (A), and we call this the "bare" theory. Under a scale 
transformation A —> Alb, the "bare" couplings are transformed into "renormal-
ized" ones: 
u (A) —> U (  (A b) 	
(16.19) 
In so doing, we change the units with which to measure energy, but we have not 
changed the theory. The scale transformations form a group, called the renormaliza-
tion group (RG), and these transformations generate RG trajectories in the parameter 
spanned by all the u . An RG trajectory cannot cross itself, since we assume that 
the equation of motion has a unique solution, given an initial condition. By conven-
tion, the direction of positive flow along an RG trajectory is that of coarse-graining, 
i.e., b > O. That s, the effective cutoff decreases with RG flow. 
In perturbative renormalization, renormalizability means self-similarilty, i.e., 
new types of coupling do not arise under a scale change. With the realization that 
in a self-contained theory the cutoff is the only scale parameter, and all coupling 
constants should be scaled by appropriate powers of the cutoff, self-similarity is 
generalized to the notion of the RG trajectory. New coupling not originally in the 
bare Lagrange my now arise. The RG trajectory is not just confined to a subspace of 
self-similarity, but may break out into new dimensions, as symbolically illustrated 
in Figure 16.1. In this generalized view of renormalization, 
• there is no distinction between renormalizable and  non-renornaliz able theories; 
• the dimensionality of the coupling parameter space cannot be predetermined; 
the admissible space is the space of all possible Lagrangians. 
New dimension 
Figure 16.1 The renormalization group (RG) 
is the group of transformation of coupling 
parameters under scale changes. The RG tra-
jectories in parameter space are not confined 
to a particular subspace, as in the case of per-
turbative renormalization, but can break out 
into new dimensions. This is made possible 
by treating the cutoff as the scale parameter 
of the system, so that all coupling coefficients 
can be made dimensionless by scaling them 
with appropriate powers of the cutoff. 

76.3 Fixed points 
319 
16.3 
Fixed points 
The fixed points of RG remain invariant under coarse-graining, and correspond to 
scale-invariant Lagrangians. At such fixed points, the correlation length 
must be 
infinite or zero at a fixed point, since (a) it is supposed to be invariant, and (b) it 
should decrease under coarse-graining. The case = 0 is ignored as pathological, 
and the case = oo corresponds to infinite cutoff. 
A fixed point is a source or sink of trajectories, and appears to be either UV 
(ultra-violet) or JR (infrared). Viewed from a trajectory flowing away, it is a UV 
fixed point, representing the high-energy limit. From a trajectory flowing in, it is 
an I R fixed point, representing the low-energy limit. These cases are illustrated in 
Figure 16.2. 
The UV case is shown in the upper panel of Figure 16.2 a UV. We can place a bare 
system on this trajectory, and obtain a renormailzed system by going downstream. 
We can then hold the renormalized point fixed, and push the bare system towards 
the fixed point, where the cutoff goes to infinity. Thus we approach the continu-
um limit while holding the renormalized system fixed. This is possible only in an 
asymptotically free theory, for which a UV fixed point exists. 
The situation is very different with an JR fixed point, which is illustrated in the 
lower panel of Figure 16.2. The JR trajectory, which flows into the fixed point 
(shown as the dotted curve), is a limiting trajectory with = oo throughout the 
curve. This is because can only decrease along the trajectory, and it is infinite at

but never reach this trajectory.

the endpoint. If we make a contour map using E  as a measure of depth, the iR 
trajectory will appear as a bottomless ravine flanked by sheer cliffs. 
A bare system cannot be placed exactly on an IR trajectory, but only on a neigh-
boring trajectory. To approach the limit of infinite cutoff, it is only necessary to 
touch any point on the IR trajectory (the flow speed being infinite). The coupling 
constants will then approach the values at the fixed point. There is no freedom 
to vary the renorrmalized couplings, except by maintaining a finite varying cut-
off. 
16.4 
Momentum Space RG 
Wilson [11 12)  proposes a specific to effect the scale change in an RG transformation. 
In a theory with sharp cutoff, the cutoff momentum is reduced from A to /1/b by 
"integrating out" the modes in between, in a manner that we shall describe. This 
gives a new action containing fewer degrees of freedom, but it describes the same 
system. There are three steps involved in this process, as described in the following, 
and illustrated in Figure 16.3: 
a. Designate fast and slow modes: Decomposing the field into a "slow" part a q  
and "fast" part fq  : 
ç9q = aq  + fq  
Uk =- 0 unless I k <  1/ b  
fk = 0 unless 
1/b < 	
< 1 	
(16.20) 
where b > 0. The partition function can be rewritten in the form 
Z = f Do-  f D fe -51"+fi 	
(16.21) 
and we imagine carrying out the f D f integration. 
b. Coarse-grain: Define a new action -5-[u] dependent only on the slow fields 
through the relation 
A 	
D fe -s[u+11  
where Ar is a constant. The new action is expanded in the form 
1 
[o] =

S 1[0 ] 	
(16.23) 
2  lql<l/b 
which defines z, r1 , and new parameters in 75 1 [4 The constant Ar is put in to 
absorb any constant terms generated, to make this expansion possible. We put

Note that u'a  depends not only on the scale parameter b, but also on the initial

It is convenient to parametrize the trajectory by an additive parameter t defined 
by 
b = 	
(16.31) 
with an arbitrary origin to. The coupling constants along the trajectory are then 
functions of t: 
= u n (t) 	
(16.32) 
From (16.29), which gives u(t) in terms of some initial value u o  = u(to), we can 
calculate the tangent vector along the trajectory: 
a u c, = 0,„(u, uo) 
We can erase the memory of the initial state by taking the limit u o  —> u * , where 
14,, is a fixed point. If this can be done, we have the conventional 0-function of 
perturbative renormalization: 
,8„(u) 	
fi (i (u, u * ) 	
(16.33) 
The advantage of the Wilson formulation is simplicity and clarity, and the disad-
vantage is its reliance on a sharp cutoff. A method proposed by Polchinski [2] has 
remedied this defect. We shall use it in the next chapter, with derivation given in 
Appendix C.

Real Space RG

The coarse-graining process of the RG transformation can also be performed in 
real space. This is Kadanoff's "block-spin" transformation [3], which historically 

16.5 Real Space RC  1 323 
precedes Wilson's momentum-space formulation. The system is defined on the 
discrete sites x of a d-dimensional hypercubic lattice, with lattice spacing a = A -1 . 
We consider again a scalar field, whose value at site x is denoted by Cc . We make 
the following correspondence with the continuum formulation:

(16.54)

16 Renormalization 
To make contact with perturbative renormalization, choose 
b = A /it 	
(16.55) 
where ,tt is the renormalization scale, to be held fixed while we make A 	
co by 
making u 0  --> u.. Multiplying both sides of (16.54) by A —n = (by), we obtain 
G(p; go, A) = Zo n/2u —ngn (p/u; ul) 
which can be rewritten in the form 
G",(p; go, A) = [zo(A 	
go)] n/2  Gn(P; g„tt) 
(16.56) 
(16.57) 
where G, is the unrenromalized correlation function, and G n  is the renormalized 
one, and g denotes the renormalized coupling constants. On the right side, the 
cutoff A explicitly appears only in the renormalization factor in front. This relation 
is the same as (13.119), and establishes the equivalence of Wilson's method to that 
in perturbative renormalization. 
16.7 
Relevant and Irrelevant Parameters 
Consider a fixed point u.. If there is a UV trajectory flowing out of it, then a point 
u on the trajectory goes away from the fixed point under the RG transformation. In 
this case u is said to be a relevant parameter, because u — u. grows. On the other 
hand, along an JR trajectory that flows into the fixed point, we have (u — u.) —> 0, 
and u is said to be irrelevant. Relevancy and irrelevancy are properties associated 
with directions in parameter space with respect to a given fixed point. 
In the neighborhood of a fixed point, we can neglect those couplings that vanish 
rapidly. Let us assume that we can limit the number of couplings to a finite number 
K, and represent them as components of a vector 
Ui 
U2 
U 
(16.58) 
u K/ 
We parametrize the trajectory by t, so that the tangent vector to the trajectory is 
du/ dt. In the neighborhood of 
to linear order in u —  u
, the RG is represented 
by a matrix equation 
d 
= R(u — u * ) 
(16.59) 
where R is called the RG matrix. Let us diagonalize R:

16.8 The Free Field 
The eigenvectors y define the principal axes, along which we have 
u(t) — u *  =  ce )" 	
(16.61) 
where c is some constant vector. If /1 > 0, the principal axes corresponds to a rele-
vant direction, for the trajectory flows away from the fixed point. If A < 0, we have 
an irrelevant direction, and u — u *  O. The eigenvalues of the RG matrix furnish 
information about the nature of the RG flow, and consequently the geometrical 
properties of parameter space in the neighborhood of the fixed point. 
The linear analysis becomes inadequate if there are null eigenvalues A = O. The 
corresponding directions are said to be "marginal", and the flow patterns have to 
be investigated in a higher order. 
16.8 
The Free Field 
We work out the RG for the free field, or Gaussian model, defined through the 
action 
where 0 is a real scalar field, with dimensionless form yo, and 
r 2u2  
Since (P- q = (Pg* , we can write 
(16.63) 
[(10 ]  = 
(t32 ± 	
bpti i2 
0<lci l< 1 
(16.64) 
where the sum over q extends only over a hemisphere. We write the same action 
either as S o [0] or So [çp]. The partition function is 
where

The partition function can be calculated directly; but, for illustration, we shall carry 
out RG transformations "by the book". 

328 
76 Renormalization 
Decomposing the field into fast and slow components, ço = f +  a,  we have 
fq  o-  _ g  = 0, because their ranges are disjoint. Thus, the free action decomposes 
into separate sums with no cross term: 
So[ f + u] = So[ f + So [a] 	
(16.67) 
The partition function factorizes: 
Z = 	
DO" f D f e —s° [ -f±a}  = 	
Due —s° 1'1  f
D f e —s ° 11] 	(16.68) 
and integrating over the fast modes yields an overall factor: 
f D f e—s° [-f-J = 
q 2 	
r 
;7-t- 
1/b<iql<1 
(16.69) 
Thus, the slow modes undergo renormalization solely because of resealing. With 
q' = qb , we have 
so[0] , 	( q 2

(16.70) 
where 
0<1 q' 
(16.71) 
Thus the RG transformation gives 
— b 2 r 	
(16.72) 
We put b = e t—t0, and regard r as a function oft:  
r(t) = re 2( ' — `0) 	
(16.73) 
Since r and to  are arbitrary, we have 
= coo2t 
r(t) 	
(16.74) 
where co  is a constant. 
The RG trajectories are depicted in Figure 16.5. There is only one fixed point 
at r 0, the Gaussian fixed point. It is an UV fixed point, corresponding to the 
high-momentum limit t —>- —co. The parameter r(t) exhibits asymptotic freedom, 
since it vanishes in the limit of infinite momentum scale. The negative r axis is 
unphysical, since it corresponds to systems whose energy spectrum is not bounded 
from below. To verify that the correlation length diverges at the Gaussian fixed

16.9 
IR Fixed Point and Phase Transition 
An JR  fixed point is the endpoint of an  JR  trajectory that forms the dividing line be-
tween two different phases. We illustrate this with 0 4  theory in d = 4 dimensions. 
The RG trajectories are shown in Figure 16.6. This parameter space is spanned by 
u 2  and 144 . Only the upper half plane has physical relevance, since we must have 
144  0 for the energy spectrum to be bounded from below. The Gaussian fixed 
point occurs at the origin, and there is an JR  trajectory flowing into it. The points P 
and Q represent cutoff theories, which approach continuum limits at any point on 
the IR trajectory. From any point in the neighborhood of the  JR trajectory, coarse-
graining will tend to decrease 144 , bringing the system close to the origin. Thus, 
in the continuum limit, the renormalized system approaches the Gaussian fixed 
point, the free-field theory. This is the so-called "triviality". 
As illustrated in Figure 16.5, the contours of constant are parallel to the JR 
trajectory, along which 
= oc. The contours of equal separation in 
become in-
finitely dense in the neighborhood of the  JR trajectory, which divides the u2

plane into the symmetry-broken phase to the left, and the symmetric phase to the 
right. The points P and Q approach continuum limits in the respective phases. In 
this limit we have u 2  —> 0 and A --> oo , and thus the mass parameter is indeter-
minate: 
m2  —> 2 u2.4. 2  
(16.77) 
We can set to an arbitrary value, and this is called "mass renormalization". In 
the symmetric phase, where m2  is positive, it gives the squared mass of the field 
quanta. In the unbroken phase it is negative, and contributes to the vacuum field 
(0) = -V— m2/4g4. 
We can interpret the 0 4  theory as a Ginsburg-Landau theory for an order pa-
rameter 0. In this case, u 2  is regarded as a temperature. The points P and Q in 
Figure 16.5 correspond to thermodynamic states near a second-order phase transi-
tion, and the eigenvalues of the RG matrix determines the critical exponents ' 3). 
16.10 
Crossover 
When a trajectory flows from the neighborhood of one fixed point to that of another, 
the qualitative nature of the system changes. This is called crossover behavior, and 
is illustrated in Figure 16.7, for 0 4  theory in d = 4 — c dimensions, 
—> 0L)  
The Gaussian fixed point describes a massless free field; but the non-trivial fixed 
point describe something else. To illustrate the difference in an extreme limit, 
imagine that the nontrivial fixed point recedes to the far corner of the second quad-
rant. The potential will become steep double well, with the field trapped in two 
possible values, and the fixed-point system resembles an Ising model. 
Consider the trajectory marked with point P in Figure 16.6. At very short dis-
tance scales, the system is near the Gaussian fixed point, and will remain there 
through orders of magnitudes of coarse-graining. Thus, the system appears to be 
a massless free field through orders of magnitudes of scale change. When we con-
tinue to "zoom out", eventually the system leaves this neighborhood, and begins to 
move towards the nontrivial fixed point. Once it gets under way, the system moves 
quickly until it comes close to the nontrivial fixed point, like the point P referred 
ti previously, where the system remains Ising-like through orders of magnitude of 
scale change. 
If we imagine performing experiments on this system, we would first see the 
system at low energies, corresponding to a point far downstream on the trajectory. 
When the energy scale is increased, the system will quickly settle down to Ising 
behavior, and remain there until we enter the realm of "high-energy physics", when 
almost suddenly we see it as a free field whose mass exhibits "asymptotic freedom". 
The terms "crossover" emphasizes the rapid transition.

Perturbative Renormalization Revisited 
It might be instructive to review perturbative renormalization in QED in light of 
present development. There are three divergent functions: the vertex T', electron 
propagator S', and photon propagator D', which are rendered finite (grudgingly) 
by a cutoff momentum A. The gist of renormalization is that A can be (thank-
fully) swept inside the renormalization constants Z1 , Z2, Z3, which appear as fac-
tors multiplying convergent quantities. Final renormalization depends on the Ward 
identity Z1  = Z2, but that is a technical property of QED. 
Let us recall the full electron propagator, which according to (13.6) has the form 
1 
P — + Orn + (p) 
To second order, X (p) is logarithmically divergent, and can be render finite through 
one subtraction: 
X (p ) = [Z(P) 
I(P0)] 	
(Po) 	
(16.78) 
Now Ic(p) = [1' (p)— E(po)] is convergent, and the cutoff A is contained in 
E (Po). The arbitrary subtraction point po establishes a scale 1u 2  = p, and in 
the convergent function y replaces A. The scale change A —> 
itt is the analog 
of A —> A lb in the Wilson scheme. 
S' (p) = 

332

Now we write

where B and A depend on A.  Thus

(0 —

A factor (1 ± B) -1  in front of

second order. The "miracle" is that 
•
a subtraction turns into a multiplication; 
• this happens to all orders of perturbation theory. 
As we have shown in (16.57), however, this is no miracle; it's just the way scaling 
works.

of the cutoff. While the cutoff was treated as a mathematical de,  '.;e  in  pe 
renormalization, it was given physical meaning in the Wilson scheme, as the 
scale parameter in an otherwise self-contained theory. Such a view is natural in the 
theory of matter, where the atomic lattice underlies the structure of a macroscopic 
body. No one would raise an eyebrow when the cutoff was introduced. 
The development in the present chapter follows Wilson's orisrnal formulation, 
which relies on a sharp cutoff, for a scale change of scale is e''re - te.7.l by "integrat-
ing out" degrees of freedom with momenta lying in a shell below the cutoff. This 
procedure is very concrete and clear. However, one might question its generality. 
A new formulation due to Polchinski [5] frees the theory from a sharp cutoff by 
regulating the free propagator with an arbitrary cutoff function. The requirement 
that the correlation functions remain invariant under a scale change is expressed 
through the statement d Z[J]/ clA = 0, where  Z[J]  is the the generating function of 
correlation functions — the partition function with external source J. This condition 
leads to a functional equation for the action, which is derived in Appendix C. 
(16,80) 

1 a 1 3 Why Correct Theories Are Beautiful I 333 
The Polchinski scheme captures the essence of Wilson's renormalization in the 
most general language. A special application worked out in Appendix C demon-
strates its remarkable computing power. It appears to be the right way to do renor-
malization; but more study is needed to fully explore its mathematical proper-
ties. 
One mighi: jump to the conclusion that all theories are renormalizable; the cou-
pling coefficients just flow along RG trajectories, which can go wherever they want. 
But this is not true. The exception occurs in theories exhibiting "anomalies", which 
destroy current conservation expected from classical physics. In perturbation the-
ory, they manifest themselves in the wrong scaling behavior for renormalizabili-
ty [6]. We offer examples in the last chapter to indicate that they might originate 
from topological excitations, but it is fair to say that we do not know where they 
really come from.

16 Renormalization 
How is it that our effective theories at different scales are so compelling as to 
make physicists think they are gods? The answer is that, like Aesop's mouse, they 
walk in front of a lion, and the lion is renormalization. 
Because of renormalization, we can understand the observed world on its own 
terms, without reference to detailed structures of a lower level. Thus, the proper 
way to calculate satellite orbits is to use Newtonian mechanics, even in the post-
quantum era. And it is better not to mention quarks when we describe supercon-
ductivity. The fact is, a system in coarse grain can appear completely different from 
that in fine grain. Looking at a certain canvas through a microscope, one only per-
ceives paint pigments. But when viewed with the naked eye, a Rembrandt might 
emerge. At different ranges of length scales, the world will appear to be governed 
by different fixed points, because of the phenomenon of crossover. A fanciful inter-
pretation is shown in Figure 16.8. 
The task of the physicist has been to find out where our RG trajectory came 
from. This is done by guessing the Hamiltonian, and working out its low-energy 
consequences to compare with experiments. This process is perhaps what Einstein 
had in mind when he said [7], 
"The axiomatic basis of theoretical physics cannot be abstracted from experi-
ence, but must be freely invented, ... Experience may suggest the appropriate 
mathematical concepts, but they most certainty cannot be deduced from it."

Problems 
Through "free inventions", physicists have had remarkable success in the seem-
ingly impossible task of reverse coarse-graining. In this they have been guided by 
the faith that a "true" theory must be "beautiful". This mysterious unity prompted 
Wigner [8] to wonder about the "unreasonable effectiveness" of mathematics, and 
Dirac")  to extol formalism. We can perhaps understand it by noting that what one 
really tries to do is to construct fixed points, which are purely mathematical objects 
endowed with a high degree of symmetry and universality. 
Problems

c) A change of scale changes the cutoff from A to Alb without changing the

this mean that 0 0  can be scaled differently from O p  with p 0? This would

differently from 0(x). 
14) In a two-lecture series on creativity in physics at Harvard University in 1960, Dirac said in the first 
lecture that he was always guided by "correct formalism". But Heisenberg, in the second lecture,

The Gaussian Fixed Point 
17.1 
Stability of the  Free Field 
To study renormalization in greater depth, we investigate the space of Hamiltoni-
ans in the neighborhood of the one fixed point we know about - the Gaussian fixed 
point, corresponding to a massless free field with Lagrangian density 
(0 0) 2  . 
We want to know, in particular, whether the fixed point is stable against pertur-
bations. Were we to displace the system from the origin of parameter space along 
some direction, by adding extra terms to the action, will the system return to the 
origin under coarse-graining, or will it go off on a tangent? Stability would mean 
that we have picked an "irrelevant" direction in parameter space, and instability 
would mean that the direction is "relevant". In the former case we would have 
"triviality", and in the latter, "asymptotic freedom". But since the parameter space 
was not there to begin with, we must invent it. The possibilities are vast, for the 
only condition is that the space contain the null element. In our investigation, the 
choice is dictated by what we can mathematically handle. 
The simplest extension is to add a mass term u 2
2 .  This is a relevant term, as we 
can see in Figure 16.5. Under coarse-graining, u 2  runs to infinity without reaching 
a fixed point. At smaller length scales, on the other hand, it approaches zero. This 
means that the mass-term is asymptotically free, which is hardly surprising, since 
it is intuitively clear that mass can be neglected at high energies. 
The situation becomes more complicated when we introduce the simplest inter-
action u 4 0 4 . The parameter space is now spanned by u 2  and u4, and the physical 
regions corresponds to the upper half plane u4  > 0. The Gaussian fixed point is 
stable if d > 4, as indicated in Figure 16.6; but it becomes unstable for d = 4 - c 
(c -÷  0+),  as indicated in Figure 16.7. When d decreases from 4, what happens is 
that a non-trivial fixed point splits off from the Gaussian fixed point and moves to 
the upper half plane. The Gaussian fixed point is now unstable, but the trajecto-
ries flowing from it are confined to an infinitesimal strip above the u 2  axis. When 
d changes in the opposite direction, the non-trivial fixed point moves towards the 
Gaussian fixed point, merges with it at d = 4, and then moves off to the unphysical 
lower half plane when d > 4.

17 The Gaussian Fixed Point 
In condensed matter physics the interesting case is d = 3. In this case, the non-
trivial fixed point is presumably located at a finite distance from the origin. The 
motivation for studying the case d =  4—  E is the hope that the critical exponents at 
the non-trivial fixed point can be extrapolated to c = 1. For particle theory, however, 
the physical case is d = 4, and we are stuck with the fact that the 0 4  interaction 
is irrelevant. To avoid triviality, we must keep a finite cutoff A. Physical quantities 
depend only on ln A, and are therefore not sensitive to changes in A. While this 
is acceptable from a phenomenological point of view, it does not seem very satis-
factory. This provides an incentive to inquire whether there are relevant directions 
emanating from the Gaussian fixed point for d > 4. 
17.2 
General Scalar Field 
We shall study the real scalar field 0 (x) in d Euclidean dimensions, whose action is 
given in (16.1). In terms of the dimensionless variables in (16.11), it has the form 
S[0] = f d d  x

In momentum space it has the form given in (16.5):

(17.2) 
where the field (pq , the coupling coefficient u„, and the momentum q are all di-
mensionless quantities. The cutoff is not explicitly seen. 
In this chapter, however, we shall start with a more general theory, to see whether 
the action is closed under RG. In particular, we want to know whether RG generates 
derivative couplings and non-local interactions not originally included. By deriva-
tive coupling, we mean terms containing derivatives of the field not of the form 
(4) 2 , as for example 
f
d d x(a2 0) 2  
A nonlocal term involves fields at different space-time  points, as for example 
f d d xd d Y0(x)K(x Y)0(Y) 
Of course, in a cutoff field theory with ostensibly "local" interactions are nonlocal 
within a spatial distance of order A -1 . By nonlocal terms, we specifically refer 

17.3  Feynman Graphs 
341 
to those for which the range of non-locality is large compared to A -1 . We shall 
first consider a very general model containing arbitrary derivative and non-local 
couplings, in order to show that, in an infinitesimal RG, such interactions are not 
generated if they were not present originally. We shall then revert to the action 
of (17.1). 
To generalize the action given in (17.2), we replace u, by an arbitrary function of 
momenta

(17.3) 
Since this quantity multiplies the symmetric combination (pg, • • • yoga  , we may take 
it to be a symmetric function. The kinetic term E (q 2  + r) g 0 00-q is generalized 
by replacing r by the momentum dependent quantity 
w(q) = r + c4 q4  + c6 q 6  + • • • 	
(17.4) 
Our starting point, then, is the action

where the sum over a extends over even integers only, and 
(q) stands for (5(q +

term has the form

(17.6) 
where (80)2n =- (81 oai or. The other terms in the action contain similar deriva-
tive couplings; but in addition, nonlocal terms can arise. For example, u 4 (q) can 
contain a term of the form (5 
, q26 q3 , q, s(q i ) w (q 3 ). This will give a nonlocal term 
with an infinite range of the nonlocality. But we are not actually going to use these 
interactions, and will not bother to impose physical constraints. 
17.3 
Feynman Graphs 
The RG has been described in Section 16.2. We introduce Feynman graphs in order 
to make certain arguments important for our later calculation. When the field is 
split into slow and fast parts with yo = a +  f,  the kinetic part of the action is

be written

(17.8) 
where N-1  = f D f exp{— S2[f]f is a constant, and  ( 0) f  denotes averaging overf

The interaction S 1  is a sum of vertices represented pictorially in Figure 17.1, where 
each line emanating from a vertex is a sum of a slow and a fast line. All the slow 
lines become external lines, and all the fast lines are internal lines to be integrated 
over. We substitute the sum of vertices into (17.10), and expand in powers of u. The 
averaging with respect to fcan be done using Wick's theorem: 
( fqi  • • • fg,) f =, Sum of all contractions

The average of an odd number off's is zero. This generates Feynman graphs in the 
usual way. For example, the first two interaction vertices give rise to the Feynman 
graphs shown in Figure 17.2. Averaging the first vertex yields a 4-line graph that

contributes to 14 14 , and a 2-line graph that contributes to u12 . Similarly, averaging 
the second vertex yields contributions to 7/6, tt'4, u'2 . Vacuum graphs are irrelevant 
because they contribute only to the constant Al. With this expansion, we have the 
rules

The second statement is the linked cluster theorem. We will not state the Feynman 
rules in detail, for we shall not need them for later calculations.

Wegner and Houghton [1] show that the renormalized action can be obtained exact-
ly to order t, with the momentum-dependent interactions introduced earlier. What 
makes this possible is that all the internal momenta in Feynman graphs are con-
fined to a thin shell of thickness 0(t) in momentum space: 
(1 — t) < lqi < 1 	
(17.15) 
Specifically, we have the following simplifications: 
• To first order in t, only tree and one-loop graphs contribute. Some of the latter 
are shown in Figure 17.3. 
• A one-loop graph with two or more vertices is generally 0(t 2 ), except that it is 
0(t) when all the internal lines carry exactly the same loop momentum. This 
requires that the total momentum of external lines at any one vertex be zero.

where external momenta are denoted p, and internal momenta are denoted q. 
This integral is 0(t 2 ) in general, because there are two q integrations, and each 
ranges over a momentum shell of thickness 0(t).  An exception occurs when p i  + 
P2 = O. The integrations are then constraint by 
(qi + q2), and the graph be-
comes 0(t). This argument applies to any vertex of a graph, even if it is a sub-
graph. 
We have shown in Section 14.9 that the sum of tree and one-loop graphs is given 
by the first two terms in a saddle-point expansion of the partition function. In this 
particular instance, the simplifications mentioned above make the calculation even 
easier. We expand the action in powers off.

Proof: Each A in the expansion corresponds to an internal line in a Feynman 
graph of momentum q. In the one-loop graphs we need, there emerge from every 
vertex two and only two internal lines with equal and opposite momenta, (since 
the external lines must have total zero momentum.) Thus we need not go beyond 
quadratic order in A, and of the quadratic term we only need to keep terms of the 
form f f

This gives, to first-order in t, 
S[a] = S[u] + t B[o] 
(17.19) 
(17.18) 
This is the Wegner-Houghton equation. 
The quantity B[o] is 0(1) because the summation over the thin shell is 0(t), 
and it is divided by t. The Wegner-Houghton equation is valid only to order t, 
in terms of its dependence on cutoff; but it is exact to all orders in the coupling 
constants u, (q). By allowing the couplings u, (q) to depend on the momenta, thus 
admitting derivative couplings in coordinate space, the theory is very general. How-
ever, not all choices of u,(q) are physical, and the constraints needed to make the 
theory physical is a problem that has not been investigated systematically. 

17  The Gaussian Fixed Point 
The Wegner—Houghton equation is a special case of Polchinski's equation de-
rived in Appendix C.

Renormalized Couplings 
We still have to transform to rescaled variables according to (16.26). To first order

It is clear that if all 1,1,, (q) = 0, then the action is invariant under RG. This estab-
lishes the Gaussian fixed point. 
If the action does not contain odd-powers of the field initially, then none will be 
generated to first order in t, because 0 q[]  is even in ço, as we can see from (17.17). 
If no derivative couplings were present initially, then to first order in t none will

be induced. This can seen as follows. Derivatives are generated by momentum-
dependent terms, and they can occur only in Ck,o] in the term

If only non-derivative local couplings were present at the start, then the above van-
ishes except for a = 2, for which it gives a term proportional to q 2 . Therefore no 
derivative couplings are generated to first order in t. We have thus shown that the 
action (17.1) is closed under RG to first order in t. 
To obtain the RG equations, we expand B [çp] and  C[p] in powers of yo to rewrite 
S'[] in the form (17.1), and read off the new coupling functions uta (q). This is 
straightforward but messy, and we shall do it only to linear order in the couplings. 
But first, some general comments about the 0-function. 
From the point of view of RG, the momentum q in  u (q) is on the same footing 
as a, being a label for the type of interaction. To emphasize this, we write 
u,(q) 	
(17.26) 
The 0-function in our case is defined by 
p a  (u/ ,-
1 (ut
A  
, — u,, q ) 
t 
 
(17.27) 
where u' — u = 0(t) by construction. By considering a function u 
q (t), we can 
write 
d 	
q (t) 
d 	
'
t 	
= ,,q (u(t), u(0)) 
(17.28) 
where u(t) stand for the set of all couplings at t, and t = 0 corresponds to the cutoff 
scale. We have calculated p exactly to first order in t. The 0-function one uses in 
particle theory corresponds to 
Pa,q(U) =  fi a , q (U, 14,
) 	
(17.29) 
where u *  is a fixed point. To calculate this will require integrating the fast modes 
over a finite instead of an infinitesimal shell in momentum space. This seems 
difficult, but its equivalent has been achieved via perturbation expansions in special 
cases. Such calculations are the forte of perturbative renormalization, although in 
that context one is not aware of the role of u * . 
Our modest calculation has non-trivial consequences. By placing u(0) at the 
Gaussian fixed point 
u(0) = u *  = 0 	
(17.30) 
we obtain the exact 0-function at the Gaussian fixed point. This gives us the tangent 
vectors of all the trajectories at that point, and we can tell which directions are 
irrelevant, and which relevant. 
347 

348 17 The Gaussian Fixed Point 
17.6 
The RG Matrix 
We study the tangent vectors to RG trajectories at the Gaussian fixed point. For 
this, we only need the linearized RG equations. All tree graphs can be ignored, 
since they are at least of second order in the couplings. The only relevant graphs 
are the one-loop graphs with one vertex, the first graph in each row of Figure 17.3, 
(the octopuses). It is easily verified that to this order y = O. 
We revert to the action (17.1), with momentum-space representation (17.2). From

350 I 17 The Gaussian Fixed Point 
a) If 2 < 0, then lp -> 0 as t -4- co. The couplings constants are irrelevant. Under 
coarse-graining, they tend to the Gaussian fixed point. On such a trajectory, the 
Gaussian fixed point is I R, and the theory is trivial. 
b) If A > 0, then zp grows with t. The coupling constants are relevant. Under 
coarse-graining, they tend to go away from the Gaussian fixed point. On such 
a trajectory the Gaussian fixed point is UV, and the theory is nontrivial. The 
trajectory is specified by some initial condition at an arbitrary point t = to , and 
it flows away from the Gaussian fixed point. The latter can be reached by letting 
t ->  -oc, in which limit the couplings vanish. This is asymptotic freedom. 
c) The case A = 0 corresponds to "marginal" coupling constants. In this case, 
we have to go beyond the linear approximation in order to determine the true 
behavior. 
Using (17.39), we can put the eigenvalue equation (17.43) in the form

separately. For d > 2, it is convenient to introduce a parameter a by writing the

For a polynomial potential of degree K in 0 2 , then, we have a = —K + 1. The 
corresponding eigenvalues are 
A = 2[1 — (d — 2)(K — 1)] (K = 1, 2, ...) 	
(17.55) 
The eigenpotential changes under a scale transformation according to 
au, 
 = AU 	
(17.56) 
The case a = 0, or K = 1, corresponds to a free field with squared mass r, which 
is relevant for all d. For a > 1, or K > 2, we have A < 0 for d > 4. For d = 3 
the eigenvalue is negative, except for the marginal case of K = 2. The case d = 3 
corresponds to the 04 theory in d = 4 — E, with RG flow shown in Figure 16.6. 
The Gaussian fixed point is relevant in this case. The marginal case d = 2 will be 
analyzed separately later. 
In summary, all potentials that are polynomials in 0 2  lead to triviality for d > 3, 
except for the free field, and the 0 4  theory in d = 3. 
In Appendix C we give an alternate derivation of the eigenotential based on 
Polchinski's equation.

352 
The eigenpotentials have the following asymptotic behavior for large ça:  
(d — 2)(p' 
2Sd 
U((p) 
exp 
(17.58) 
Nothing in canonical field theory rules out such a potential. 
Sufficiently close to the Gaussian fixed point, the potential is proportional to r, 
which evolves in t according to 
r(t) = r(to)e)` (t— `°)  = Ce)` t 	
(17.59) 
with C = r( to) exp(— to). This is a running coupling constant, with an arbitrary 
renormalized value r(to ) at the reference point to. The theory is nontrivial, because 
the potential does not tend to zero in the low-momentum limit. Instead, we have 
asymptotic freedom, corresponding to the fact that the potential vanishes in the 
limit t —> —oo, which corresponds to infinite momentum. 
In order to have spontaneous symmetry breaking on the semiclassical level, the 
eigenpotential must have at least one minimum at (p 0 0. The power series expan-
sion for the eigenpotential reads 
r Sd 
Uct(0 	
(d

az 2 	
a(a + 1)z3  
z+ 	
 
(3/2)2! 	
(3/2)(5/2)3! 
(17.60) 
where z is defined in (17.52). A sufficient condition is that U'(0) < 0, and U > 0 for 
large z. The first is satisfied by choosing r < 0. Asymptotically U is proportional 
to r[(a — 1)T (a)]- 1 , the rest of the factors being positive. Thus we must have 
-8 
Figure 17.4 Eigenpotentials for d = 4, with 
(x) being a dimensionless field variable, 
exhibiting spontaneous symmetry breaking. 
Theories with these potentials are covariant 
with respect to RG. The curves correspond, 
from top to bottom, values of the eigenvalue  
parameter a uniformly spaced from —0.999 
to —0.001. All potentials behave like expço 2  
for large yo. The theories are all non-trivial and 
asymptotically free. The limiting case a = —1 
is the 0 4  theory, which is trivial. 

353 
17.8 The Case d -= 
(a — 1)F (a) < 0, which is equivalent to 
(a — 1) < O. Using the formula 
E(a)r(—a) = 
sin(yt a), and the fact that F(a) is positive for a > 0, we find 
that a must be in one of the open intervals (-1, —0), (-3, —2), etc. For a nontrivial 
theory, we have 
> 0, or 2 + (d — 2)a > O. Combining these requirements, we 
obtain the sufficient condition 
2 	
 < a < 0 
d — 2 
(17.61) 
A family of eigenpotentials for this range of a, and d = 4, is plotted in Figure 17.4. 
The eigenpotential Uu ((p) corresponds to a theory that lies on a trajectory tangent 
to a principal axis. Generally, we can consider a theory on an arbitrary trajectory, 
which is represented near the Gaussian fixed point by a linear superposition of the 
eigenpotentials. This gives us considerable freedom in choosing potentials. 
17.8 
The Case d = 2 
We now calculate the eigenpotential for d = 2. The Kummer function does not 
apply, and we have to go back to (17.45):

where /1 is the eigenvalue of the RG matrix. We can rewrite the recursion relation

where R (t) = A 2  r(t). This is dubbed the "sine-Gordon equation" [4]. 15)  For 0 < 
y 2  < 8/c, the potential is relevant, and the theory is asymptotically free. For  y 2  > 
8:r it is irrelevant, and the theory is trivial. These conclusions agree with those 
arrived at through perturbation renormalization. 
As we shall see in the next chapter, the angular nature of the field dictates the 
existence of vortices, which cannot be described within the linear approximation 
considered here.

Perturbation theory in powers of r should break down for d < 4. The dimension 
d = 4 is called the "critical dimension" for the Gaussian fixed point. In the theory 
of critical phenomena, one tries to circumvent the difficulty through the so-called 
"4 — E expansion", in which one sets d = 4 — c, and uses a double perturbation 
expansion in powers of r and  E.

In two Dimensions 
18.1 
Absence of Long-Range Order 
We consider systems in two Euclidean dimensions, which may be statistical sys-
tems in two spatial dimensions, or quantum field theories in one spatial dimen-
sion. These interpretations are merely different aspects of the same partition func-
tion in the language of path integrals. For definiteness, we phrase our discussion 
in terms of statistical mechanics. 
From a physical point of view, the essence of two-dimensionality is that long-
range order cannot be maintained over arbitrarily large distances, due to large fluc-
tuations of the Goldstone mode [1]. An equivalent statement is that spontaneous 
breaking of a continuous symmetry is impossible: 6)  We shall illustrate this in a 
simple model. 
Consider a collection of atoms in a plane, in which a crystal of size L x L begins 
to form. Let x denote an equilibrium lattice site, and u(x) the deviation of an atom's 
instantaneous position from x. We can make the decomposition 
u(x) = 
1 	
k•X 	(k) 	
(18.1) 
1„k 
where q2(k) is the amplitude of a normal mode of type A, of wave vector k. In 
thermal equilibrium, the amount of energy residing in this mode is given by 
E2 (k) =-
1 04(k)lq.),(k)1 2 	
(18.2)

where w (k) is the normal frequency. At absolute temperature T, this should be 
equal to T by equipartition, (in units with Boltzmann's constant set to unity.) Thus,

Since formation of a crystal means that translational invariance is broken, there 
exists a Goldstone mode whose frequency co o (k) approaches zero in the limit k 
O. This corresponds to lattice phonons, with w o(k) = ck, where c is the  velocity of 
sound. Thus we have a lower bound:

where A is the inverse lattice spacing. As L —> oc,  the integral diverges like ln L. 
This shows that crystalline order cannot be maintained over long distances, for it 
will be disrupted by long-wavelength density fluctuations. 
18.2 
Topological Order 
Although long-range correlations are eventually disrupted, they can extend over 
a considerable distance, because (u2 ) diverges only logarithmically. In fact, there 
can exist crystalline structure of macroscopic size. The boundaries these patches 
are domain walls, which can be modeled by removing lines of atoms from the 
lattice, leaving chasms across which the atomic interactions are altered. Domain 
wall so created are illustrated in Figure 18.1. The endpoint of a domain wall is a 
"dislocation center", or center for short. To find a dislocation center through a site-
by-site inspection would be very tedious; but there is an easier way. Let us go around 
a circuit made up of successive lattice steps, such that we make n steps in each of 
the 4 directions. For example, Figure 18.1a shows a circuit with n = 3, starting at A. 
On a perfect lattice a circuit will return to the starting point, but it does not close if 
we go around a dislocation center. The difference between the starting point A and 
the endpoint B is called the Burgers vector. When we go around a single dislocation 
center, the Burgers vector is either +1 or —1, as illustrated in Figure 18.1(a) and (b). 
We call the +1 case a "center", and other an "anticenter". In general, the Burgers 
vector of a circuit is the sum of contributions from the centers enclosed. It is a 
topological property independent of the size and shape of the circuit, as long as it 
goes around the same set of centers. We now imagine that the imperfect crystal is 
very large, so we can draw a circuit C of macroscopic size, on whose scale the lattice 
appear to be almost a continuum. We associate with C a topological order parameter 
defined as 
(C) = (N± — N_) 	
(18.6) 
where N± is respectively the number of centers and anticenters enclosed by C, and 
() denotes thermal average. This is a loop function, and quite different from a local 
order parameter. 
A isolated center can cost a lot of energy, because a domain wall must extend 
from the center to the surface of the system, and there is a fixed energy per unit 
length. On the other hand, the domain wall that connects a center with an anticen-
ter has energy proportional to their separation. Thus, in an infinitely large system,

there must be an equal number of centers and anticenters, tied in pairs by do-
main walls. These pairs may form an "ionized" gas, or a collection of tightly bound 
"dipoles", as illustrated in Figure 18.2. These configurations are characterized by 
different behaviors of the topological order parameter. 
In the ionized state, the centers are uniformly distributed. The probability of 
finding a center or anticenter inside C is proportional to the area enclosed by C. 
The average value of N+ — N_ is therefore proportional to the statistical fluctuation 
N+,  the square root of the area, or the perimeter L( C) of the closed loop. 
In the bound state, on the other hand, a bound pair makes no contribution to the 
order parameter, unless it is cut through by C. The number of pairs cut is propor-
tional to L(C), and a cut pair contributes ±1 with equal probability. Therefore, the 
average contribution is proportional to the fluctuation V L(C). 
Thus, up to a proportionality constant,

where L( C) is the perimeter of the loop C. The two cases become distinct for large 
loops, such that L(C) 
—>  oc. In a thermodynamic treatment of this system, one 
finds there is a phase transition between a low-temperature bound phase, and a 
high-temperature ionized phase. In the bound phase the system responds to an 
external stress like an elastic solid, whereas the ionized phase cannot support any 
stress at all, but flows like a liquid. This model forms the basis of a theory of 2D 
melting [2]. We shall discuss the phase transition in the equivalent XY model. 
18.3 
XY Model 
The XY model consists of a 2D square lattice of classical spins s i  of unit length, 
which are free to rotate in the xy plane. The energy of the system is given by 
Exy[0] = —J 	
s i 	
._/ Lcos ( e 1 _0;) 	
(18.8) 
where Oi is the angle of s i  with respect to some fixed axis, and (ij ) denotes a 
nearest-neighbor pair. This is invariant under a simultaneous rotation of all the 
spins. The partition function is given by 
zxy =
fo  2.7 
d 01 e
101 	
(18.9) 
where fi is the inverse temperature. The absence of spontaneous magnetization in 
2D can be proven rigorously, and is known as the Mermin—Wagner theorem [3]. 
Our physical discussion earlier shows that there can be large but finite patches 
of magnetization; but long-range correlation is disrupted by defects, which in this 
case are vortices, as illustrated in Figure 18.3. They have the property that the spin 
rotates through 27c around a vortex, and —2:r around an antivortex. They bear a 
one-to-one correspondence with dislocation centers and anticenters, and we can 
take over the idea of topological order from the 2D crystal.

E[0] = —

(18.11) 
where po  is a constant. This looks just like a free field theory, and we seem to have 
lost the vortices. However, there is an important difference, namely, 0 has physical 
meaning only modulo 2yr. The system has a kind of gauge invariance, and, as 
pointed out by Berezinkii [6], this gives rise to vortices.

With this, we can identify our continuum model with a limit of the GL model: 
E[0] = EGL [po, 0] 	
Const. 	
(18.16) 
With this, it is convenient to take the spin variable as

poe i°  , being a com-
plex representation of a planar spin. The spin-spin correlation function has been 
calculated by Berezinskii [7]:

This is equal to (cos( 0 (x)
— 0 (0))), because (sin( 0 (x)
— 0 (0))) = O. This correlation 
function is "gauge invariant", for it depends only on 0 mod(27t). 
Consider the gauge non-invariant correlation function:

Formally this is just a correlation function of a free field in 2D. It says that the 
probable value of 0 (x) increases with distance, when it is fixed at x = O. If 0 (x) 
were an ordinary scalar field, this simply means that the field amplitude gets larger 
and larger. But since 0 (x) is an angle, this says that it makes an increasing number 
of revolutions as I xi increases. Sufficiently far the origin, therefore,  O (x)mod(2r) 
will be randomized, and  e9()t)  will average to zero. Therefore, in an infinite 2D 
system 
(V) = 0 	
(18.19) 
This statement is equivalent to the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and has been proven 
more rigorously by Hohenberg [8] and Coleman [9]. 
Consider now two paths P and Q with the same endpoints, as illustrated in Fig-
ure 18.4. The phase change along P and Q may differ by a multiple of 27r, since 
only 0 mod(2r) has physical meaning: 
(f2  — fp) ds V 0 = 27-cn (n =  0,+1,  ±2, ...) 	
(18.20) 
We can regard the two paths as a closed path C = Q —  P.  When C is continuously 
deformed, the line integral cannot change continuously, by must jump by units of 
+27r. These quanta are vortices or antivortices, defined by 
(18.17)

363 
78.3 XY Model 
Figure 18.4 The phase change along P and Q may differ by an 
integer multiple of 2.7r. signifying the presence of vortices within 
the close path Q — P. 
For counter-clock-wise C, the sign +1 (-1) corresponds to a vortex (antivortex). We 
shall refer to the quanta generically as "vortices", and regard an antivortex as a 
vortex with vorticity —1. 
The loop C cannot be shrunken to a point, because the angle becomes ill-defined. 
Therefore the function 0+ (x) has singularities at the location of the vortices, and 
we need a short-distance cutoff This is introduced by decreeing that there is a 
"vortex core" of radius a, inside of which we set  0± (x)  = O. This renders the space 
effectively non-simply connected. 
An explicit solution for the vortex field is 
0 ±(r, (p) = +ço 	
(18.22) 
where (r, (p) are cylindrical coordinates with respect to the vortex center. The ref-
erence axis cp = 0 is arbitrary, and changing this axis is a gauge transformation. 
That the phase angle increases by +2yr around the vortex is the hallmark of a 
"gauge soliton": A transformation in spatial coordinates induces a "gauge trans-
formation" of the internal coordinates. The  velocity field of a vortex is gauge invari-
ant: 
V 0+(r,(p) = ±—
CP 	
(18.23) 
where rp is the unit vector in the (pi direction. The  velocity field is tangent to circles 
about the vortex center. The velocity in this case corresponds to the difference 
between neighboring spins in Figure 18.3. 
The energy of a vortex is, up to an additive constant, 
Po 	
2 
= 	
d xlV 0 ±12  = po ln 
2 
(18.24) 
where R is the radius of the whole system. The energy of an isolated vortex diverges 
as R 
oc;  but that of a dipole pair remains finite, because the corresponding ve-
locity field is short-ranged. Thus, in an infinite system there must equal numbers of 
vortices and antivortices. The vortices are just like dislocation centers in a 2D crys-
tal, and we can take over the definition of the topological order parameter (18.6), 
with the property (18.7).

Kosterlitz—Thouless Transition 
To see whether a system of vortices can undergo a phase transition, consider an 
ionized gas of N/2 vortices and N/2 antivortices, with uniform density. The free 
energy of the system at temperature T is given by 
F = E — TS 	
(18.25) 
where E is the total energy: 
E = Nyrpo ln—R 
a 
(18.26) 
and S is the total entropy, the logarithm of the number of ways to distribute the 
vortices and antivortices in space. The number of way to place one vortex is (R/a) 2 , 
the ratio of total area to the area of the core. Thus 
S = Nln (—R )2 
(18.27) 
a 
The free energy is thus 
F = N(yrpo
— 2T) In —
a 	
(18.28) 
This shows that there is a critical temperature 
=- zp0/2 	
(18.29) 
For T > T, the free energy decreases with increasing N, favoring the creation of 
free vortices. If T < 'lc , however, the free energy is minimum at N = 0. That 
means the free vortices will form tightly bound pairs. This phase transition, which 
marks a change in topological order, is known as the Kosterlitz—Thouless transi-
tion [10]. 
18.5 
Vortex Model 
We can now describe the continuum limit of the XY model taking vorticity into 
account, in a manner similar to Section 15.5. Since the vortex core makes the space 
non-simply connected,  VO  has both longitudinal and transverse parts: 
VO -, Void-VxA 	
(18.30) 
where V co is a regular function, representing spin-wave contributions, while V x A 
is singular, coming from vortices. We can obtain A from the expression for V 0+,  
but it is easier to find it from the defining condition 
364 
cis • V x A = 2,7z- n 	
(18.31) 

78.5 Vortex Model 
365 
For point-like vortices, this can be rewritten in differential form: 
V2A = —in(x) 	
(18.32) 
where is the unit vector normal to the plane of the system, and n(x) is the "vortex 
charge density": 
n(x) =pix5 2 (x — ri ) 
The vortices are centered at r1••-rN, with "charges" p i  = +1 for vortex, —1 for 
antivortex. Using the 2D Green function 
1 	
Ix I 
G(x) =

(18.33) 
we obtain 
A(x) = 	
d 2  y

i=1 
This holds outside of vortex cores. Inside any vortex core A(x) = O. 
In the presence of N vortices, the energy functional (18.11) should be generalized 
to

Since the total vorticity should be zero for an infinite system, 
pi = 0 	
(18.37) 
We see that the vortex system is equivalent to a neutral 2D Coulomb gas.

RG Trajectories 
We make an RG transformation through the scale change a --> aet , without alter- 
ing the system. For infinitesimal t, we rewrite (18.55) by splitting the integral:

which has the same form as (18.55), except for a change of parameters. As we can 
see, Ks  is scale- invariant. 
The differential form of (18.59) gives the RG equations of the XY model [10]: 
d 1 =  2
3z 2  0(z 4) 
dt K 
d z 2  	
 = z 2 (4 — 2grK) 
0(z 4) 
dt 
(18.61) 
The line z = 0 is a continuous distribution of fixed points. An isolated fixed point 
occurs at z = 0, K = 2/yr. This is the critical point of the KT transition, and we 
call it the KT fixed point. In terms of the temperature T = pp/ K, the critical point 
occurs at '11 = YrPo/ 2 . Let

dr

(18.63) 
From the first equation we see that drIdt > 0. Thus trajectories always flow in the 
positive r direction. 
Dividing the first equation by the second, we obtain dr/dz = 2,7 2 z/r, which 
leads to the orbit equation 
T2 2 ,7T 2 z 2 = c 
 
(18.64) 
where C is an integration constant. The trajectories are hyperbolas, as shown in Fig-
ure 18.5. There are two asymptotes corresponding to C = 0. The left asymptotic is 
the transition line of the KT transition. In the region to the left, all trajectories flow 
into the fixed line. This means that z is irrelevant, and there are no free vortices. 
The correlation length diverges in the entire region, and the correlation function 
has algebraic rather than exponential behavior.

KT fixed point 
Figure 18.5 RG trajectories of the XY model. Here,  r is a reduced temperature, and z is a vortex 
fugacity. 
The region to the right of the transition line represents the high-temperature 
phase, where all trajectories eventually tend towards large r and z. The points A 
and B in Figure 18.5 lie on opposite sides of the KT transition line, with A in the 
low-temperature phase and B in the high-temperature phase. 
In the region between the right asymptote and the positive 1-  axis, all trajectories 
are UV, and the fixed line is unstable against vortex creation. 
We have derived the RG equations in a fugacity expansion to order z 2 , and this 
only covers an infinitesimal strip just above the negative r axis. We can analytically 
continue the RG equations to positive r, but the domain of validity remains an 
infinitesimal strip. Fortunately, this is sufficient to give a complete understanding 
of the KT transition, because the strip contains the fixed point. 
The correlation function of this model is the same as (18.17), except that the 
phase angle should include contributions from vortices: 
(x) = co (x) 	
v(x) 
where co (x) represents the spin wave part, and 
v(x) = 	
p 
is a sum of vortex contributions (18.22). The correlation function is thus 
G(x) 	
(e ico(x) e—ia)(0) )(e iv(x) e—iv(0) )  
(18.65) 
(18.66) 
The spin-wave factor is given by (18.17), and Kosterlitz [10] has calculated the vortex 
contribution in the low-temperature phase at the KT fixed point: 
(e iv(x) e—iv(o) ) 	
(110-1/4 pnwad 1 18

Thus in the low-temperature phase 
G (x) = [1n(r/a)] 118  (r1a)—(112"°p0)-114 	
(18.68) 
which verifies that the correlation length is infinite. 
In the high-temperature phase, the correlation length is finite, but diverges at 
the critical point. Recall that 
a e—t  under a scale change. Let A r be the distance 
to the transition point at fixed z. To find how depends on A r, we shall find how 
r depends on t. 
In the high-temperature phase, since C > 0 in (18.64), we put C =  a2 .  The 
transition line corresponds to a = O. A point such as B in Figure 18.5 moves along 
the trajectory when t changes, but moves to a different trajectory when a changes. 
We want to find the correlation between these movements. The distance to the 
transition point at constant z is given by 
	
 a 2 
A r  = c — / c 2  — a 2  
(18.69) 
where c = 'N/17E-Z. By integrating the RG equation for r, we obtain its t dependence 
(with arbitrary origin):

which becomes —7r/2a = t when a —> O. In terms of A r, then, we have

where c' is a constant. Therefore the correlation length diverges like

The extra term the first equation comes from the fact that K is no longer dimen-
sionless. The second equation is unchanged because z remains dimensionless. We 
see that the KT fixed point is moved to a location above the z axis. But there is no 
longer a line of fixed points. As shown in Figure 18.6, there is a line crossed by 
trajectories at normal incidence. It is this line that becomes the fixed line at z = 0 
when E -> O. The fact that the fixed point is off the z axis means that the fugacity 
expansion no longer yields exact answers. 
18.8 
Universal Jump of Superfluid Density 
Ordinarily, when a superfluid is heated, the superfluid  density decreases to zero 
according to a power law. Nelson and Kosterlitz [13] pointed out that in 2D the 
superfluid density suddenly jumps to zero at the transition point, with a universal 
discontinuity. This can be seen by inspection of Figure 18.5. We recall that K, is 
scale invariant in 2D, and therefore has the same value along a RG trajectory. Thus, 
as the point A approaches the transition line, Ks  —> 2/.7r, the KT fixed point. At 
the point B, on the other hand, Ks  = 0, because it is equal to its value at high 
temperatures. There is thus a discontinuity across the phase transition line:

dz 2  
dt 
K5 =  
2pr 
(Low-temp phase)

(High-temp phase) 
(18.74) 
The superfluid density is Ps  = /3-1  K,, in some natural units, in which the energy 
functional lpo  f d x (V 0) 2 . In physical units the superfluid velocity is (h / m)V 0 , 
and all densities acquire the units (h/ m) 2 . Thus the  superfluidity  density has a 
discontinuity given in physical units by

where the numerical value refers to helium atoms. The jump is universal in that 
it depends only on atomic constants. It has been tested in experiments on helium 
films from different laboratories, using different methods to measure the super-
fluid density, with different film substrates and thicknesses. Very good agreement 
was obtained, as shown in Figure 18.7. This indicates that only the temperature

A general vortex than is a configuration 0(x, y) satisfying 95c. dxkak 0(x, y) =

the current defined by j k(x, y) = E ki al 0(x, y) fails to satisfy the expected identity

ter 18, in the presence of an external magnetic field W. We view it here as a classical 
field theory in one spatial dimension. 
The topological essence of this model is as follows [1]: The field variable 0(x) is 
an angular variable defined on a circle Sl, while the boundary condition e 10  = 1 
identifies the points x = +co, and compactifies the manifold of x to S 1 . Thus, 
(x) represents a map S —> S 1 , which falls into classes labeled by an integer 
winding number, which denotes the number of time the .1) manifold is covered 
when the x manifold is covered once. The winding number is invariant under ho-
motopic transformations — continuous deformations of the field configuration.

The classical vacuum — the configuration of lowest energy — corresponds to 
0(x, t) = 0 mod(2.7). A topological soliton is a solution in which the field ap-
proaches different but equivalent values as x —›- +oo, for example

The solution can be obtained by minimizing the Hamiltonian. Consider first a 
static soliton. Since the potential is zero only when q) = 27rn, to keep the potential 
energy small 0 would like to switch from 0 to 27r suddenly, but that would costs 
too much kinetic energy. A compromise is struck by having the transition occur in 
an interval of width L. The kinetic energy is then of order 1/L, and the potential 
energy is of order W L. Thus,

The soliton is a "kink" in the field centered at some location xo , as illustrated in 
Figure 19.1. The energy is independent of xo . 
We can construct a time-dependent soliton, which moves with a definite velocity 
without changing its shape. To do this, let

where x0  is an arbitrary constant. The name soliton was derived from the "solitary" 
wave witnessed in 1834 by J. Scott Russell [2]: 
I was observing the motion of a boat which was rapidly drawn along a narrow 
channel by a pair of horses, when the boat suddenly stopped — not so the mass 
of water in the channel which it had put in motion; it accumulated round the 
prow of the vessel in a state of violent agitation, then suddenly leaving it behind, 
rolled forward with great velocity, assuming the form of a large solitary elevation, 
a rounded, smooth and well-defined heap of water, which continued its course 
along the channel apparently without change of form or diminution of speed. I 
followed it on horseback, and overtook it still rolling on at a rate of some eight 
or nine miles an hour, preserving its original figure some thirty feet long and 
a foot to a foot and a half in height. Its height gradually diminished, and after 
a chase of one or two miles I lost it in the windings of the channel. Such, in 
the month of August 1834, was my first chance interview with that singular and 
beautiful phenomenon. 
Such solitary waves have been observed in plasmas and optical media. But our 
interest here is confined to the topological aspects of static solitons.

19.2 
Instanton and Tunneling 
The static soliton is obtained by putting y = 0: 
0(x) = 4 tan-1 (e/ w('°) ) 	
(19.14) 
Classically, this represents a time-independent field configuration in one dimen-
sion. But, in quantum theory, we can interpret x as Euclidean time. In this view, 
0(x) is the coordinate of a particle, and the soliton (19.14) interpolates between the 
vacua 0 (—oc) = 0 and 0 (oc) = 2yr in Euclidean time. 'tHooft [3] named it the "in-
stanton", for one could imagine that the vacuum "pops" at time x0 . We can show 
that the instanton give the transition amplitude for quantum tunneling between 
the two vacua. 
Consider a quantum mechanical particle of unit mass and coordinate 0 , mov-
ing in a potential V(0), which possesses two minima at 0 1  and 0 2 , as shown in 
Figure 19.2. The amplitude for a particle to tunnel from 0 1  to 0 2  at zero energy is 
given in the WKB approximation by

In this semi-classical approximation, the particle is a wave packet of zero classical 
energy, whose motion is described by classical mechanics (in real time) except for 
the tunneling. It was located initially at 0 1 , and makes a quantum jump with prob-
ability I TwKB 1 2  , to appear at 0 2  with zero velocity. Thereafter, its motion is again 
governed by classical mechanics except for tunneling. 
The quantum jump can be regarded as a process happening in imaginary time

This show that the instanton is the Feynman path that dominates the tunneling 
amplitude in the semi-classical limit. 
19.3 
Depinning of Charge Density Waves 
We now apply the instanton description of tunneling to a physical problem. In 
linear-chain conductors, such as TTF-TCNQ (tetrathiafulvalene—tetracyanoquino-
dimethane), there exists a periodic charge distribution p(x, t) called a charge den-
sity wave (CDW) [4]: 
p(x t) = + Po cos(Qx + 95 (x, t)) 	
(19.24) 
where is a uniform background density, po  the amplitude of the CDW, Q the 
wave number, and 0 (x, t) is the phase relative to an underlying periodic lattice.

Figure 19.3 The potential seen by a charge density wave in an external electric field. In a small 
"bubble" in space, the phase angle 0 can go from 00 to 01 by tunneling. 
When the wave number Q is the same as that of the lattice, the latter presents a 
commensurate potential that pins the CDW, preventing it from sliding. In equilib-
rium, then, 0 (x. t) has a value 0 o everywhere. If we turn on an external electric 
field, the potential will become "tilted", as shown in Figure 19.3, and the CDW 
can slide by tunneling from 0 0  to 0 1  = 0 0  ± 2:r. This process cannot take place 
throughout the chain simultaneously; the probability of that is nil. Due to random 
fluctuations, thermal or quantum mechanical, a small one-dimensional "bubble" 
of phase 01 occurs somewhere, and then expands to engulf the whole chain [5]. 
What happens in real time may be described as follows. In the absence of an elec-
tric field, the periodic lattice potential leads to a sine-Gordon form for 0 (x, t), and 
there are soliton solutions. Random fluctuations can create a soliton-antisoliton 
pairs somewhere along the chain, so that 0 (x,  t) looks momentarily like the con-
figuration in Figure 19.1(c). In the presence of a electric field, there is incentive for 
the pair to grow in order to lower the energy, and the size of this excitation expands 
to eventually cover the entire chain. 
We treat the creation of the bubble as a tunneling process — a quantum jump 
in Euclidean time. Outside of this transition, the motion proceeds according to 
classical mechanics in real time. This description is a one-dimensional version of 
Coleman's theory [6] of a bubble of "true vacuum" in a background of "false vacu-
um"

where — W cos 0 is the commensurate potential due to the underlying lattice, and 
E is the external electric field in suitable units. We have rescaled the variables to 
absorbed physical parameters such as charge and mass, so as to present a neat form 
for mathematical analysis. The fact that the electric field is coupled directly to the 
phase 0 may be seen as follows. The current density in the system is j a aolat.

infinite past, and off in the infinite future.

a finite-sized bubble of phase 0 1  = 0 0  + 27r appears somewhere at r = 0. At this 
time, the quantum jump is complete, and the subsequent expansion of the bubble 
classically. The semi-classical picture is based on the fact that tunneling occurs with 
very small probability, and is treated as a rare interruption of the classical motion. 
For the formal solution, we take advantage of the symmetry under Euclidean 
time reversal, and impose the boundary conditions

a mean radius R, with 0 E  = 00  outside the radius, and O E = 0 1  inside. The wall

After the bubble is formed, it expands according to the equation of motion in real

tion, which becomes a function of x 2  — t 2 . Thus, the size of the bubble expands

What we have described is the sliding of the CDW by one lattice length due to 
tunneling. It is clear that this process repeats, and generates a current proportional 
to the transition probability: 
I — Ce  W / 2E 	
(19.36)  

19.4 Nonlinear Sigma Model 
383 
This current is extremely small, and has not been detected experimentally, because 
it is masked by currents arising from thermal fluctuations. In an incommensurate 
lattice, the CDW is not pinned by the lattice, but by impurities. The depinning due 
to tunneling across impurities can be described in a similar manner [7]. 
19.4 
Nonlinear Sigma Model 
We turn to a model with interesting topological properties. Consider a unit 3-vector 
field n(x) in a d-dimensional Euclidean space. The Euclidean action is 
1 
s 	
— f ddx  B  nau Is, 
4 
(19.37) 
where a = 1, 2, 3 labels field components, and the Greek index itt = 1, 	
, d is a 
Euclidean index for general d. For specific dimensions such as d = 2 or d = 3, we 
switch to Roman indices k. In physical applications, this model is variously known 
as the "classical Heisenberg model", or "0(3) nonlinear sigma model", (for histori-
cal reasons that need not concern us). The nonlinearity arises from the constraint 
n a na  — 1 	
(19.38) 
The designation 0(3) refers to the fact that n(x) may be identified with a point on 
the surface of a 3-dimensional sphere, and therefore corresponds to an element of 
the rotation group 0(3). 
Since rotations can also be represented by S U(2), we can map the model to one 
involving a spinor field. Let z be a two-dimensional spinor: 
Z = ( Z1) 
Z2 
where zi are complex-number fields, with the condition 
* 
zz = Zi*  Zi + Z2  Z2 = 
We can represent n in the form 
n = Z
ffZ 
 
where a, (a = 1, 2, 3) are the 2 x 2 Pauli matrices. More explicitly, we put 
ni  = 2 Re(z i* z2) 
n2  = 2 Im(zr z2 ) 
n 3  = zz i  — z27z2

Thus, the action can be written in the form

We can define a vector potential by

The field n(x) can be visualized as a point on the surface of a sphere, which 
constitutes the 2-sphere S 2 .  For a finite-action solution, it must approach a constant 
vector at infinity: 
n(x) 	
> 
no  
ixi—>00 
(19.49) 
For definiteness we take n o  = (0, 0, 1). Thus, spatial infinity is thus identified as 
one point, and the space is effectively compactified from Euclidean space R d  to the 
d-sphere S d  . A finite-energy solution therefore corresponds to a map 
n(x): S d  —* S 2 	
(19.50) 
These maps fall into homotopy classes Cm  characterized by a winding number m. 
The maps in each class are "homotopic", in the sense that they can be continuously 
deformed into one another [8]. The classes 
Co, C1, • .1 form a group, the homo-
topy group. For a map S d  —> X, the homotopy group is denoted by .TC d (X), called 
the "d-th homotopy group" of X. In particular, 7r 1  (X) is called the "fundamental 
group" of X. 
For the 0(3) nonlinear sigma model, the relevant homotopy groups are 
 
i(S 2) = 
T 2(S 2) = Zoo  
t 3(5 2) = Zoo  
r 4(S 2) = Z2 
(19.51) 

19.5  The Skyrmion 
385 
where 0 denotes the trivial group containing only the identity, Zoo  denotes the set 
of integers 10, +1, ±2, • • • 1, and Z2 is the group 10, 11mod(2) under addition, or 
11, —11 under multiplication. We see that there are topological solitons for d > 1. 
They can be regarded either as a static soliton in d spatial dimensions, or an instan-
ton in d — 1 spatial dimensions and one Euclidean time dimension. We discuss the 
different dimensions separately. 
19.5 
The Skyrmion 
The Skyrmion [9] is a static soliton of the 0(3) nonlinear sigma model in two spatial 
dimensions. Let us represent n(x) by a unit vector whose tip lies on a sphere in an 
internal space with axes labeled by a = 1, 2, 3. There is thus an internal coordinate 
frame attached to each point x, and we take all these frames to have the same rela-
tive orientation. An element of the surface of the sphere is dS = (d d S 2 , d S 3 ), 
with

dS = nadSa = —

(19.53) 
As x ranges over the compactified spatial S 2 , n(x) ranges over the internal 5 2 . The 
winding number of the map n(x) is the number of times the internal S 2  is covered, 
and is thus given by 
1
f 
 dS(x) 
4,7  
(19.54) 
where dS(x) is the surface element corresponding to n(x), and the above integral 
extends over the range such that x covers S 2  once. A convenient way to express 
this condition is to use (x 1 , x 2 ) as the parameters 
2 ). Therefore the winding 
number of the configuration n(x) is given by

For 0 = 1, take w (z) = z /A. This leads to

To obtain the corresponding antisoliton, replace ço by —yo, or replace n 2 (x) by 
—n2 (x). We visualize this soliton in the two views presented in Figure 19.5. In the 
view (a) we sketch n(x) along a radius from the origin in the spatial plane. In the 
view (b), we superimpose the internal S 2  on the compactified spatial S 2 , showing 
a "hedgehog" configuration. 
The solution can be viewed as an instanton, if we regard x 1  = x as space, and 
x 2  = r as imaginary time. As illustrated in Figure 19.6, the instanton evolves 
along world lines shown in (a), and the tip of the vector n(x, r) traces closed loops, 
as shown in (b). When (x, r) covers space-time once, the locus of n(x, r) sweeps 
over the 2-sphere once.

The Hopf Invariant 
Viewing the Skyrmion as a static soliton in 2D, it is natural to ask how it propagated 
in time. To consider this question, we go to d = 3, where n(x) represents the Hopf 
map S 3  -> S 2 . 
Let us parameter S 2  by two parameters (
1 , 	
and consider first a continuous 
map R 3 	
S 2 , represented by the functions 
fi ( x l , x 2 , x 3) 	
(19.76) 
4-2 	
f2 ( x l , x 2 , x 3) 
For a given point on 5 2 , i.e., for given 	
the above gives two relations among 
the coordinates Ix 1 , x 2 , ,C 3 1, and one combination of the coordinates remains arbi-
trary. This means that the inverse map of a point on S 2  is a curve on R 3 , and the 
curve must be a closed loop, since a point has no boundary. Two different closed 
loops cannot intersect, for otherwise the intersection would be mapped to different 
points. To insure that the closed loops do not run off to infinity, we require 
(x) 	
C 	
(19.77) 
lxi—>00 
where C is a constant. This compactifies R 3  to S 3 , and the map f is the Hopf map, 
which is illustrated schematically in Figure 19.7. As shown in the figure, two loops 
in 3-dimensional space are characterized by a topological invariant, the linkage 
number, giving the number of times one loop winds around the other. The linkage 
number is a property of the map, called the Hopf invariant. If we displace the image 
points P" and 0' continuously, the loops P and Q will change, but the linkage 
number remains the same. It is now evident that  r3( S 2) = Z.

S 2  maps closed loops into points, because the two spaces 
have different dimensions. Any two closed-loop inverse images are characterized by the linkage 
number, which is the Hoof invariant of the map.

The Hopf map can be represented by the spinor representation introduced earli-
er in (19.41): 
n(x) = z (x)az(x) 	
(19.78) 
We can write the spinor z in the form 
390 
(19.79) 
where U E S U(2), and zo  is some fixed spinor. An element of S U(2) is of the form 
U = bo  + b • 	
(19.80) 
with bo  -1- 1b1 2  = 1. Therefore the manifold of S U(2) is S 3 , and (19.78) represents 
a map S 3  S 2 . Since n is invariant under the gauge transformation z 
e iYz, 
the inverse map is a circle on S 3 , as depicted in Figure 19.7. 
Since z(x) is a map S 3 	
S 3 , the representation (19.78) involves a two-step 
map S 3 	
S 3  --->- S 2 , and the winding number of the step S 3 	
S 3  is the Hopf 
invariant: 
1 
H = 	
f d S(x) 
(19.81) 
where d S(x) is a volume element of the S 3  manifold of z (x), and the integral is 
such that x ranges over its S 3  manifold once. The factor 27E2  is the volume of S 3 . 
Parametrizing the manifold of z by 3 parameters (A l , 22, 2 3 ), we can write 
H= 
 
d, 8(21, 2 2, 2 3)  
2,72 	
a(x l , x 2 , x 3) 
(19.82) 
The Jacobian in the integrand is eijkaiA l aj 22 8k 23, which is a 3-form constructed 
from z. There is only one such 3-form  Eij kAi  aj Ak, with A k  = —izt ak z. Thus we 
have the Hopf invariant up to a normalization constant, which can be calculated 
from an explicit construction of z (x). (See Problem 19.3.) The result is

As we have seen in (19.47), A is like a vector potential. The corresponding mag-
netic field is a topological current density that is identically conserved: 
B= V xA 	
(19.84) 
There is an interesting parallel with classical electromagnetism. Because of the 
gauge invariance (19.48), we can impose Coulomb gauge V • A =- 0. Putting

we can write

(19.88) 
To derive this formula, consider the solid angle subtended by the loop Qat the point 
x, and count the number of 47r increments as x traverses the loop P. The gradient 
of the solid angle in question is the magnetic field created by a unit current flowing 
in the loop Q, which can be obtained via the Biot-Savart law. Thus, (19.87) calcu-
lates the Hopf invariant of the configuration by calculating the Gaussian linkage 
between loops of the topological current. 
Finally, we express the topological current (or magnetic field) B in terms of n(x):

This is the only invariant we can construct out of n a  (x) involving 2 derivatives. The

Fractional Spin 
We now show that the spin of the 2D Skyrmion is an arbitrary real number [12]. We 
regard n(x) = n(x, r) as a 2D Skyrmion evolving in imaginary time r, and imagine

Figure 19.8 A Skyrmion makes complete rotations during its imaginary-time evolution. The 
number of rotations is the Hopf invariant of the space-time con figuration. We introduce a spec-
tator anti-Skyrmion, in order to have a vacuum on the space-time boundary. 
that it makes one complete rotation in space as it propagates from t  =  —oc  to t  = 
00. In Figure 19.8, we show two world lines of points on the Skyrmion, identified by 
given values of the spin. For example, the world line at the center of the Skyrmion 
has n = (0, 0, —1). The initial and final states of the Skyrmion are the same, but 
any two world lines are linked once. The number of complete rotations made by 
the Skyrmion is in fact given by the Hopf invariant of n(x, r). To see this, imagine 
that at r = —oc a Skyrmion-anti-Skyrmion pair was created, and pulled apart. 
The Skyrmion propagates in the manner indicated, with the anti-Skyrmion as a 
passive spectator, and eventually the pair annihilates at r = 00. World lines from 
the anti-Skyrmion are indicated by dotted lines in Figure 19.8, which completes the 
Skyrmion world lines into closed loops. On the space-time boundary we now have 
the vacuum configuration n = (0, 0, 1). Hence the function n(x, r) is a Hopf map 
S 3  —›- S 2 , and the linkage of any two closed world lines is the Hopf invariant. 
Now describe the process in Minkowski space-time, by continuing t  = — it. The 
Minkowski action is

We can add to this a term 0 H, where 0 is an arbitrary real number, without chang-
ing the equation of motion. This is because His a integer and cannot change in the 
continuous variations made in applying the action principle. Thus, the amplitude 
for the process is 
A(0) = Ar 
—
J  Dneisini+i0H 
(19.93) 
where IV is a normalization constant, such that the vacuum-vacuum transition 
amplitude is 1. For all paths contributing to the above integral H = 1. Thus relative 

I

393 
to the vacuum-vacuum amplitude we have 
A(0) = e 10 	
(19.94) 
Equating this to e2' 1J, where J is the spin of the Skyrmion, we obtain an arbitrary 
real number: 
(Skyrmion) 	
(19.95) 
This result does not contradict basic principles of quantum mechanics, for the 
rotation group in 2D is the Abelian group U(1), and thus the angular momentum 
may have continuous eigenvalues. 
Continuing in this vein, we can view the time development of the Skyrmion, 
described by a configuration with nonzero Hopf invariant, as a 3D static soliton 
— the "Hopfion". To find the spin of the Hopfion, we go to d = 4, where n(x) 
becomes a map ,S 4  5 2 , with .74 ( S 2 ) = Z2. The additive topological invariant 
has possible values 
I = 0,1 mod(2) 	
(19.96) 
As before, we may add to the Minkowski action a term 0 I without affecting the 
equation of motion, but now we must require e210 - 1. Therefore the values for 0 
are quantized: 
0 = yrn 	
(19.97) 
where n is an integer. Repeating the argument in the last section, we find that the 
spin of the Hopfion must be integer or half-integer: 
0 	
n 
J = kr  — (Hopfion) 
2 
(19.98) 
This is of course implied by the angular-momentum commutation relations in 3D. 
What is unusual is that we can construct half-integer spin states from boson fields. 
19.8 
Monopoles, Vortices, and Anomalies 
According to (19.91), the topological charge of a Skyrmion is the magnetic flux nor-
mal to the x 1 —x 2  plane, in which the static Slcyrmion resides. If we follow the time 
development in imaginary time x 3 , the Skyrmion will sweep out a flux tube, which 
cannot terminate because of the conservation of the topological current (19.90). 
However, there exist monopole configuration in d = 3 that will destroy the conser-
vation law. for example the "hedgehog" configuration 
gxa 
n a(x) = 	
 
xj 
 
(19.99) 

19 Topological Excitations 
which is singular at the position of the monopole pole. This means that the world 
line of the Skyrmion can be of finite length, terminated at both ends by monopole 
and antimonopole, respectively. Such singular configurations may be ruled out in 
a classical theory, but cannot be ignored in quantum field theory, for the path in-
tegral extends over all fields, singular or not. In quantum theory, therefore, the 
monopoles render the topological current "anomalous". 
To demonstrate the existence of the monopole, let us calculate the vector po-
tential corresponding to a Skyrmion in the x 1 —x 2  plane, with topological charge 
Q = 1. From the explicit solution (19.75), we find 
Ak (
ço)
r, 	
ak ga  sin2( r) /2) 	
(19.100) 
where f(0) = 7r, f(oo) = 0. The magnetic flux through a loop C of radius r is given 
by 
(r) = 56c  dx k  Ak  = 2,7r sin2 (f(r)/2) 	
(19.101) 
which is 2.7t-  for r = 0, but approaches zero as r 	
oo. The total flux over the 
x 1 —x 2  plane is therefore zero, in contradiction with the fact that Q =  1 by con-
struction. The discrepancy is due to the failure of the relation between the flux and 
the topological winding number, because of the presence of a monopole in d -= 3. 
As illustrated in Figure 19.9(a), where the compactified  x'—x 2  plane as a spherical 
surface, the flux through the close loop C1  is 2.7r, but that through C2 is zero. This 
implies that there is a monopole inside the sphere, which terminate the flux tube 
of the Skyrmion. In this picture, the world line of the Skyrmion is the Dirac string 
of the monopole. When we open up the compactified sphere, the world line of the 
Skyrmion is illustrated in Figure 19.9(b), which is terminated by the monopole. 
Apart from the short-distance singularity, a single monopole has infinite action, 
and would not contribute to the path integral; but a monopole-antimonopole pair 
can contribute. Thus, the topological current in the 0(3) nonlinear sigma model in 
d = 3 should have a non-vanishing divergence given by the monopole density in 
the vacuum state. In analogy with the XY model in d = 2, the theory should have a 
phase in which monopole-antimonopole pairs are tightly bound, and one in which 
they are ionized. The topological current will be normal in the former phase and 
anomalous in the latter. Such a scenario is supported by numerical studies [13]. 
The mechanism that causes a current anomaly can be demonstrated analytically 
in the simpler XY model. In the presence of an external magnetic field W, the XY 
model is described by the Euclidean version of the sine-Gordon model (19.2), with 
action

and we have ak i k  =' 0 for non-singular field configurations. However, the conser-
vation is violated by a vortex configuration 0 0 (x, y) which satisfies 
ds • Vq50(x, y) — 27rv0 	
(19.104) 
where C is a closed loop containing the origin of the x—y plane. As shown in Prob-
lem 18.1, a solution is 
0o(x, y) = vo  tan-1 (x/y)

(19.106) 
As shown in Problem 18.1, we have for this configuration 
V • j -= 2o-rvo  6 2 (x) 	
(19.107) 
Thus we expect the current to be anomalous in the high-temperature phase above 
the Kosterlitz—Thouless transition. This is verified in a more detailed analysis [14]. 
A physically important anomaly occurs in the the chiral current of a Dirac field 
discussed in Problem 6.4. For a massless field this current is conserved in a clas-
sical theory, but not when the theory is quantized. The divergence of the current 
turns out to be given by a magnetic charge density. The current is somewhat differ-
ent from those considered above, in that it is not defined as a topological current. 
We refer the interested readers elsewhere for a full discussion [15].

configuration with Hopf invariant 1. 
a) Use spherical coordinates x = (r,  O,  (p). Show that S 3 , which is the surface of a 
4-dimensional sphere of unit radius, can be parametrized by the 4 coordinates

Classical Mechanics 
A classical particle is a object characterized by a position vector q, whose compo-
nents { (3', • • • , qd} are functions of the time t. In the non-relativistic regime, the 
time dependence is governed by Newton's equations: 
a V (q) 	
, 
(I = 1, 	
, d) 	
(A10) 
aqi 

A.3 Quantum Mechanics

where m is the mass, and V(q) the potential. The Lagrangian function is defined by 
L(q, 4) = -2 mq — V(q) 	
(A11) 
where q2  =  q q i . Newton's equations can be represented in the form 
d8L 	
aL

dt 84i 	
a qi 
If there are N particles, the above equation still applies, provided we interpret q as 
the collection of all the coordinates. 
A.3 
Quantum Mechanics 
Classical mechanics must be supplanted by quantum mechanics, whenever any 
relevant physical quantity of dimension energy x time becomes comparable or 
smaller than Planck's constant 
h = 6.27 x 10-27  erg sec 	
(A13) 
The state of a system in quantum mechanics is associate with the direction of a 
vector in a Hilbert space — a ray in Hilbert space. Two vectors differing only in 
normalization represent the same state. Physical observables are associated with 
hermitian operators on the Hilbert space. The inner product between two state 
vectors W and 0 are denoted either by the notation ( W , ) commonly used in 
mathematics, or the Dirac notation  (WI  0). The inner product between W and 
00 , where 0 is a hermitian operator, is denoted by the equivalent notation 
(V1 , 00) = (WI010) 	
(A14) 
For a non-relativistic particle in one dimension, the relevant operators are mo-
mentum p and position x, which are defined by the commutation relation 
[p, x] = —ih 	
(A15) 
where h = h/2yr. We summarize properties for a one-dimensional system. It is 
straightforward to general them to higher dimensions. 
We assume that there exist a Hamiltonian operator H(p, x), which is hermitian 
and time-independent, and it generates time translation: 
It + dt) = 	
— — H dt) 	
+ 0(dt2 ) 	
(A16) 
where I t) is the state of the system at time t. For time translation over a finite 
interval A t, we subdivide the interval into N successive infinitesimal intervals. In 
the limit N

(A23)

where p is the  probability density for finding the particle at x at time t, and j is the 
corresponding probability current density. For a real wave function j = O. 
The operators p and x in infinite space have continuous spectra of eigenvalues. 
It is more convenient to work with countable sets of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. 
To do this, we enclose the system in a large but finite box of dimension L, and 
let L Do at the end of all calculations. The boundary condition imposed on 
the surface of the box is not crucial, because it usually affects the wave function 
only in a finite layer near the boundary, and has no effect on volume properties, 
such as the energy density. A convenient choice is the periodic boundary condition 
(x 	
L) = (x). For a plane wave 7,u (x) = e ikx , this means the wave number k 
is restricted to the discrete values 
k =

 (n = 0, ±1, ±2, ...)

Superfluidity 
B.1 
Linear Response 
We illustrate the calculation of a response function to a disturbance in the path-
integral formalism, where no references are made to Hilbert-space states and op-
erators. It is suited to macroscopic descriptions based on the Ginsburg—Landau 
free energy, which may be looked upon as a very general quantum field theory. We 
consider the example of superfluidity, and derive formulas used in Chapter 15. 
Superfluidity is a transport property defined in terms of the response of a system 
to an imposed velocity field. We assume that the imposed field w i(x, t) is infinites-
imal, and adiabatically turned on and off: 
)

I t I

In response, the momentum density of system changes by an amount 5 g i  (x , t). 
The Fourier transforms of these quantities are denoted by

response function z:

(B3) 
where () denotes thermal average. The inverse Fourier transform reads

Consider the static response

on  k 1 .  Its most general form is thus given by

(k) =

ki 
k2 	
B (k 2) 
(B6) 
where A and B are two scalar functions associated respectively with the longitudinal 
and transverse response. The longitudinal response for long wavelengths define 
the total mass density p of the system: 
p 	
A(0) 	
(B7) 
while the transverse response defines the "normal fluid density": 
B(0) 	
(B8) 
The "superfluid density" is the difference 
Ps 	
A(0) — B(0) 	
(B9) 
These definition can be justified as follows [1-3].

First put the system between flat disks with normal along the x axis, as shown in 
Figure B.1. This is realized by first letting L2 -> 00, L3 ---> 00, and then L 1  —>  oc. 
The imposed velocity field can be created by moving the disks in the x direction 
with infinitesimal velocity w 
The entire system must move with the disks, and 
therefore the induced momentum density is the total density p times the velocity:

Superfluid Density 
Let us now calculate the superfluid density for a system described by a velocity field 
v(x), with Landau free energy 
E[v] = _ f cipxlv(x)12 	
(B21) 
The partition function of the system is 
Z = f Dve — fi EN 	
(B22) 
where fi is the inverse temperature. We impose a prescribed velocity field w(x), 
understood to be switched on and off adiabatically. The energy becomes 
E[y] = —
Po f d D  xlv(x) — 
2 
The first-order change in energy is 
6E  = f dD  xg i  (x)w i  (x) 
where 
e (x) = Po v (x ) 
which is defined as the momentum density. This averages to zero in the unper-
turbed system. With the external velocity field, the average momentum density 
becomes 
= Po f Dve —i3Ew [viv i (x)

To first order in w, we can neglect the second term, and integrate both sides to 
obtain the linear response

(B28)

(B29) 
where () denotes thermal average without external field, and we have assumed

result with (B10), obtain the response function

Decompose the velocity field into longitudinal and transverse parts

with V • = 0, and V x NTT  = O. Then 
fip02 f e xe —ik•x [(v (x ) 
(0)) + (14(x)4(0))] 	 (B32) 
We have used (14(x) v (0)) = 0, which follows from the fact that there is no cross 
term in the energy E[v]. 
To obtain the superfluid density, we have to decompose z1  into longitudinal and 
transverse parts. We write in matrix notation 
Z(k) = A(V)PL B(k 2)PT 	
(B33) 
where 
1 k 1

Taking the matrix trace  oft, we have 
Trz(k) = A(k 2) + (D — 1) B(k 2 ) 	
(B35) 

Appendix B Supedluidity 
Thus 
B(k
2) = Tr(k) — A(k2) 
D — 1 
(B36) 
The superfluid density is 
Ps  = A(0) — B(0) = A(0) 
D 	Tr z (0) 
D — 1 A(k0) 	
 
D — 1 
We now calculate Tr z (0): 
Tr x(0) — A(0) 
D — 1 
(B37) 
Tr z(0) = p20.  f d °  x _0)1, (x)q (0)) + ( 
( ) li-(0))] 	
(B38) 
The longitudinal contribution satisfies the f-sum-rule: 
po  f d p  x(vz(x)v(0)) = 1 
Thus 
Tr z(0) = Po + 	
f (I D  x ( 1)I'i(x)v'( 0)) 
This leads to the formula 
Ps =

Here, K-1 (x — y) is the regulated free propagator, which differs from the inverse

Appendix C Polchinski's Renorrnalization Equation 
As an example, 
Gk (A) = —
k2 f(k 2  I A 2) 	
(C7) 
where the cutoff function is such that f(0) = 1, f(z) 	
0. A sharp cutoff 
z—>oo 
corresponds to f (k 2  1 A 2) = 0 (1 — k 2  I A 2). 
In Wilson's renormalization scheme, high-momentum modes are "integrated 
out", but not discarded, in order to effectively lower the cutoff. This changes the 
form of S', but the system itself is unaltered. A similar process takes place in per-
turbative renormalization, although the scale change is effected in a technically 
different manner. In both schemes, all correlation functions change in appearance, 
but not in substance. An old correlation function, as function of old coupling coef-
ficients, is rewritten as a new correlation function involving new couplings, times 
a renormalization factor. This is most clearly stated in (13.119): 
Op; A, go) = Z(A 1,u , go)G(p;,u, g) 
g =- g(A ,u, go) 	
(C8) 
That G' is actually independent of the scale parameter ,u is stated in (13.120): 
d 
= 0 	
(C9) 
These statements form the basis of the Callan—Symanzik equation (13.122). 
Polchinski [1] rephrases the condition in the form 
d Z[J, A]  
dA 	
° 
where Z[J, A] is the generating functional of correlation functions, the partition 
function in external field J: 
Z[J,./1] = f 	
(C11)

C.2 The Equation 
We call this Polchinski's renormalization equation. This is a functional equation for 
the action that implies the Wegner—Houghton equation (17.20), which is the first-
order expansion of the action about some fixed cutoff A 0 : 
S [0, A0 + 	
S [0, A 0] + dA (œ
cil 	
(C14) 
dA 
A=/10 
If we used (C13) to calculate the last term above, we would get a generalization of 
the Wegner—Houghton equation to arbitrary cutoff. But (C13) is far more general, 
for in principle we can try to solve it to determine the action. 
It should be noted that (C13) does not involve a rescaling of the field. The rescal-
ing step is to be added when S'generates a correction to the kinetic term So , and 
one wishes to bring to it back to the standard form (Cl). 
To derive Polchinski's equation, it suffices to set J = 0. We start by calculating 
dZIdA in momentum space:

The measure D contains normalization factors that may depend on the cutoff, 
but we shall ignore that, since the normalization does not affect the correlation 
functions. In view of this, (C10) should be understood to be modulo normalization. 
Now substitute Polchinski's equation (C13) for dS' IdA:

The above vanishes (modulo normalization) because it consists of field integrals 
of total derivatives, and e— s vanishes at infinite field. This verifies Polchinski's

Following Periwal [2], we use Polchinski's equation to rederive the eigenpotential 
in Section 17.6 that gives an asymptotically free scalar field.

C.3 Asymptotically Free Scalar Field

We work in the neighborhood of the Gaussian fixed point, where S' = 0. Thus 
we can linearize Polchinskf s equation. Assuming that there are no derivative cou-
plings, we write S' as the integral of a local potential: 
S' [0, A} = A d  f d d  xUA (A 1–d12  0(x)) 	
(C22) 
where we have introduced appropriate powers of A to render S' and un 
 dimen-
sionless. The equation to be solved is

Now we seek eigenpotentials with the property

A

where A.  > 0 corresponds to asymptotic freedom. The equation for the potential 
becomes

The subscript A on UA can be omitted, because the A-dependence has been ab- 
sorbed into K. For d

tion

The solution is, up to a normalization factor,

where M is the Kummer function. We have subtracted 1 to make U (0) = 0. This is 
permissible since it adds a constant term to the action, affecting only the normaliza-
tion of the partition function. This recovers the eigenpotential (17.50), except that K 
replaces Sd, and that the normalization is left undetermined by the homogeneous 
linearized equation.
