The two-dimensional Ising model with nearest-neighbour pair interactions is simulated on the
Creutz cellular automaton by using the ﬁnite-size lattices with the linear dimensions L = 80, 120,
160, and 200. The temperature variations and the ﬁnite-size scaling plots of the speciﬁc heat and the
Binder parameter verify the theoretically predicted expression near the inﬁnite lattice critical temper-
ature. The approximate values for the critical temperature of the inﬁnite lattice Tc = 2.287(6), Tc =
2.269(3), and Tc =2.271(1) are obtained from the intersection points of speciﬁc heat curves, Binder
parameter curves, and the straight line ﬁt of speciﬁc heat maxima, respectively. These results are in
agreement with the theoretical value (Tc =2.269) within the error limits. The values obtained for the
critical exponent of the speciﬁc heat, α = 0.04(25) and α = 0.03(1), are in agreement with α = 0
predicted by the theory. The values for the Binder parameter by using the ﬁnite-size lattices with the
linear dimension L = 80, 120, 160, and 200 at Tc = 2.269(3) are calculated as gL(Tc) = −1.833(5),
gL(Tc) = −1.834(3), gL(Tc) = −1.832(2), and gL(Tc) = −1.833(2), respectively. The value of the
inﬁnite lattice for the Binder parameter, gL(Tc) = −1.834(11), is obtained from the straight line ﬁt of
gL(Tc) = −1.833(5), gL(Tc) = −1.834(3), gL(Tc) = −1.832(2), and gL(Tc) = −1.833(2) versus L = 80,
120, 160, and 200, respectively.

1. Introduction
The application of fractal concepts, ﬁrst introduced
by Mandelbrot et al. to describe complex natural
shapes and structures as well as mathematical sets and
functions having an intricately irregular form, has been
studied [1 – 4]. The aggregation of particles to form
cluster has, for a long time, been one of the central
phenomena in natural science with important implica-
tions for physical problems such as air pollution, di-
electric breakdown, bacterial colony growth, and natu-
ral formations (snowﬂakes and manganese dendrites).
The model allow an exploration of the process of
pattern formation in real physical systems which is
based mostly on the model of diffusion-limited aggre-
gation. This model describes the most important mor-
phology patterns observed in various non-equilibrium
systems, such as diffusion-limited aggregation-like,
dendrite, needle, tree-like, dense-branching, compact,
stingy, spiral, and chiral structures [5 – 14].

The Creutz cellular automaton [15] has simulated
the two dimensional Ising model successfully near the
critical region, and has reproduced its critical expo-
nents within the framework of the ﬁnite-size scaling
theory [16,17]. This algorithm is an order of magni-
tude faster than the conventional Monte Carlo method
and it does not need high quality random numbers.
These features of the Creutz cellular automaton would
make the Ising model simulations in higher dimen-
sions more practical. Compared to Q2R cellular au-
tomaton [18] it has the advantage of allowing the spe-
ciﬁc heat to be computed from the internal energy ﬂuc-
tations.
The purpose of this study is to test the ﬁnite-size
scaling study of the speciﬁc heat and the Binder param-
eter of the two-dimensional Ising model for the frac-
tals obtained by using the model of diffusion-limited
aggregation. However, the test studies in d = 2 dimen-
sions are not available. The simulations are carried out
on the Creutz cellular automaton, which has success-

fully arisen as an alternative research tool for Ising
models in the dimensionalities 2 ≤d ≤8 [19].
The model is described in Section 2, the results are
discussed in Section 3, and a conclusion is given in
Section 4.
2. Model
In the model of diffusion-limited aggregation, the
central particle is placed in the closed square lattice.
Another new particle is started to move on the edge of
the lattice site. If this fragment passes by the neigh-
bouring site of the central particle during the random
moving, it ﬁxes there. The same conditions are applied
to the other particles. However, when the particle or
a group of particles goes out of the determined lattice
site, at which the particle is cancelled, then another par-
ticle is suggested. The operation is repeated until the
suggested number of particles in the aggregate, i. e. the
behaviour of a particle or a particle group, is obtained.
At the Creutz cellular automaton, four binary bits
are associated with each site of the lattice. The value
for each site is determined from its value and those of
its nearest neighbours at the previous time step. The
updating rule, which deﬁnes a deterministic cellular
automaton, is as follows: Of the four binary bits on
each site, the ﬁrst one is the Ising spin Bi. Its value
may be “0” or “1”. Ising spin energy (internal energy)
of the lattice, HI, is given (in units of the nearest neigh-
bour coupling constant J) by
HI = −J ∑
⟨i,j⟩
SiS j,
(1)
where Si = 2Bi −1, and ⟨i, j⟩denotes the sum over all
nearest neighbour pairs of sites. The second and the
third bits are for the momentum variable conjugate to
the spin (the demon). These two bits form an integer
which can take on the value 0, 1, 2, or 3. The kinetic
energy (in units of J) associated with the demon can
take on four times these integer values. The total en-
ergy
H = HI +HK
(2)
is conserved; here HK is the kinetic energy of the
lattice. For a given total energy the system tempera-
ture T (in units of J/kB where kB is the Boltzmann
constant) is obtained from the average value of the ki-
netic energy. The fourth bit provides a checkerboard
style updating, and so it allows the simulation of the
Ising model on a cellular automaton. The black sites
of the checkerboard are updated and then their color
is changed into white: the white sites are changed into
black without being updated.
The updating rules for the spin and the momentum
variables are as follows: For a site to be updated its
spin is ﬂipped and the change in the Ising energy (in-
ternal energy), HI, is calculated. If this energy change
is transferable to or from the momentum variable as-
sociated with this site, such that the total energy, H, is
conserved, then this change is done and the momen-
tum is appropriately changed. Otherwise the spin and
momentum are not changed.
As the initial conﬁguration all spins are taken or-
dered (up or down). The initial kinetic energy is ran-
domly given to the lattice via the second bits of the
momentum variables in the white sites. The quantities
computed are averages over the lattice and the num-
ber of time steps during which the cellular automaton
develops.
The simulations are carried out on simple hyper-
cubic lattices L2 of linear dimensions 80 ≤L ≤200
with periodic boundary conditions by using two-bit
demons. The cellular automaton develops 9.6 · 105
(L = 80, 120, 160, 200) sweeps for each run with seven
runs for each total energy.
3. Results and Discussion
The fractals obtained by using the model of
diffusion-limited aggregation are illustrated in Figure 1
for the lattice with L = 80, 120, 160, and 200. In d = 2
dimension, the ﬁnite-size scaling relation for the spe-
ciﬁc heat CL is derived below [16,20]. The ﬁnite-size
scaling relations for the critical temperatures and the
free-energy density are given as [16, 20]:
(Tc −Tc(L)) ∝L−1/ν,

fL = L−dF(tLyt,hLyh),
h →0,
L →∞,

where yt = 1
ν and yh = ∆
ν , with dν = 2 −α and ∆=
γ +β, t = (T −Tc)/Tc is the reduced temperature with
t > 0 for T > Tc and t < 0 for T < Tc, h is the reduced
external magnetic ﬁeld, α, β, and γ are the critical ex-
ponents for the speciﬁc heat, order parameter, and the
magnetic susceptibility of the inﬁnite lattice, respec-
tively. Thus, fL takes the following form:
fL = L−dF(tL1/v,hL(γ+β)/v).

CL takes the following form:

At h = 0 (7) becomes
CL = F(tL1/v),
(8)
where F = F(x) is the ﬁnite-size scaling function (the
shape function) for the speciﬁc heat. This is the relation
to be tested. The plots of CL versus temperature (T)

tion of the curves in Figure 2 for 80 ≤L ≤200 gives
the critical temperature of Tc = 2.287(6) at which the
speciﬁc heat maxima occur when L →∞. The straight
line ﬁt in the plot of TC
c (L) vs. L−1/v also implies
Tc = 2.271(1) as L →∞, seen in Figure 3. These results
are in agreement with the value of the Creutz cellular
automaton result of Tc = 2.263 [17] and the theoretical
prediction of Tc = 2.269 [22]. In order to calculate the
critical exponent for the speciﬁc heat we use the gen-
eral relation forCL at h = 0 and t = 0. Thus, (6) reduces
to the following form:
CL ∝Lα/v.
(9)
This relation is also used for the maxima of the ﬁnite
lattices. By using the data of Table 1 in getting the log-
log plots ofCL(Tc) and Cmax
L
vs. L, the following values
of α are obtained: α = 0.04(25) and αmax = 0.03(1),
the average of which is α = 0.03(25). These result
is in agreement with α = 0 results predicted by the
theory.
In Figure 4 we show the ﬁnite-size scaling plot of
the speciﬁc heat. In this ﬁgure, not all of the data points
for a given L fall on the ﬁnite-size scaling curve which
is formed by the overlapping parts of the plots for dif-
ferent L. Since all the scaled quantities of CL for dif-
ferent L values overlap above Tc, the ﬁnite-size scaling
relations for CL is valid only in the region above Tc.
Therefore, this scaling for CL is veriﬁed only in the re-
gion tL1/v > 0, but not in the region tL1/v < 0. It should

be mentioned that the contribution to CL from the reg-
ular part is not considered in this plot. That is, the val-
ues of the speciﬁc heat computed in the simulations are
used directly in the plots.

Binder [16,20, 21], the critical point Tc is located by
ﬁnding the common crossing point of plots of gL vs.
temperature for a range of different system sizes L
[16,20, 21]. The temperature variation of the Binder
parameter for L = 80, 120, 160, and 200 is shown
in Figure 5. In this ﬁgure, the intersection point of
the curves for 80 ≤L ≤200 gives Tc = 2.269(3)
which is in good agreement with the theoretical pre-
diction of Tc = 2.269 [22]. From Figure 5 the val-

lattices with the linear dimension L = 80, 120, 160,
and 200 at Tc = 2.269(3) are calculated as gL(Tc) =
−1.833(5), gL(Tc) = −1.834(3), gL(Tc) = −1.832(2)
and gL(Tc) = −1.833(2), respectively. From Fig-
ure 6 and Table 2 the value of the inﬁnite lat-
tice for the Binder parameter, gL(Tc) = −1.834(11),
is obtained from the straight line ﬁt of gL(Tc) =
−1.833(5), gL(Tc) = −1.834(3), gL(Tc) = −1.832(2),
and gL(Tc) = −1.833(2) versus L = 80, 120, 160,
and 200, respectively. This result is in good agreement
with the Monte Carlo simulations results of gL(Tc) =
−(1.830 −1.835) [23 – 27].
The ﬁnite-size scaling relation for the Binder param-
eter has the following form:
gL = G(tL1/v),
h →0,
L →∞,
(11)
where t > 0 for T > Tc and t < 0 for T < Tc. We il-
lustrate gL vs. tL1/v in Figure 7. Since all the scaled
quantities of gL for different L values overlap above
Tc, the ﬁnite-size scaling relations for gL is valid only
in the region above Tc. Therefore, this scaling for gL
is veriﬁed only in the region tL1/v > 0, but not in the
region tL1/v < 0.
4. Conclusion
Creutz cellular automaton computer simulations are
a tool in scientiﬁc ﬁelds such as condensed-matter
physics, including surface-physics and applied-physics
problems (metallurgy and diffusion, etc.). With the in-
creasing ability of this method to deal with quantum-
mechanical problems such as quantum spin systems
or many-fermion problems, it may become useful to
answer some questions in the ﬁelds of elementary-
particle and nuclear physics as well.
In this work, the two-dimensional Ising model is
simulated on the Creutz cellular automaton using the
ﬁnite-size lattices with the linear dimension L = 80,
120, 160, and 200 for the fractals obtained by us-
ing the model of diffusions-limited aggregation. Since
all the scaled quantities of CL and gL for different
L values overlap above Tc, the ﬁnite-size scaling re-
lations for CL and gL are valid only in the region
above Tc.
