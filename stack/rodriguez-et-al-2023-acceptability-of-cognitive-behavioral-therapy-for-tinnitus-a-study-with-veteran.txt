Purpose: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a gold standard yet underuti-
lized treatment for tinnitus, and tinnitus is especially highly prevalent among vet-
erans. The aims of this study were twofold: to determine (a) if CBT for tinnitus is 
underutilized because participants find it less acceptable than other behavioral 
treatments for tinnitus and (b) if veterans and nonveterans rate behavioral treat-
ments for tinnitus differently. 
Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted online with a sample of 277 
adults in the United States who self-reported at least some level of bothersome 
tinnitus in the past week. The sample for this study consisted of 129 veterans 
and 148 nonveterans. Participants read descriptions of CBT, tinnitus retraining 
therapy (TRT), and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). For each treat-
ment, presented to them in random order, they provided credibility, expectancy, 
and acceptability ratings. 
Results: Among 277 participants, 147 (53.07%) reporting gender were women, 
216 (77.98%) reporting race/ethnicity were White, and 129 (46.57%) were vet-
erans of any branch of the U.S. Armed Forces. Veteran ratings of credibility, 
expectancy, and acceptability were significantly lower than nonveteran ratings 
across treatments. There were differences in credibility, expectancy, and 
acceptability ratings across treatments, and post hoc testing revealed that TRT 
was consistently rated higher than CBT or MBSR. 
Conclusions: Despite strong research support, CBT was rated as less accept-
able than a different, less widely empirically supported treatment. Veterans’ rat-
ings of acceptability were lower than those of nonveterans across all treatments. 
Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of 
an external stimulus and is often described as a ringing or 
hissing sound (Baguley et al., 2013; Bauer, 2018). If this 
perception of sound originates from a specific bodily 
source, it is considered objective tinnitus (Lockwood 
et al., 2002). However, the majority of cases are consid-
ered subjective, meaning the sound is only perceived by 
the individual and not tied to a clear physiological event 
(Baguley et al., 2013). Reports of tinnitus prevalence in 
the United States vary, with most falling between 4% and 
15% of all adults (e.g., Møller, 2011). Tinnitus can differ 
in its level of associated bother, varying from no bother to 
severe impairment. Recent efforts to define tinnitus have 
drawn attention to the need to devise a standardized clini-
cal definition of tinnitus as well as the need to differenti-
ate between the auditory percept and the emotional or 
psychological distress caused by tinnitus (De Ridder et al., 
2021). Perhaps connected to the psychological distress that 
some people with tinnitus experience, researchers have 
also identified comorbid tinnitus and mental health com-
plaints such as anxiety and depression to be common 
(Carlson et al., 2019; Krog et al., 2010; Malakouti et al., 
2011; Shargorodsky et al., 2010). 
Currently, there is no known reliable cure for sub-
jective tinnitus (McFerran et al., 2019; Searchfield et al., 
2011), although tinnitus can sometimes subside with the

use of appropriate hearing aids (Searchfield et al., 2010; 
Shekhawat et al., 2013; Trotter & Donaldson, 2008). Per-
haps as a result, many patients feel that the treatment they 
receive for tinnitus is not particularly effective (Husain 
et al., 2018). Clinical guidelines on the management of tin-
nitus encourage providers to spend time discussing treat-
ment options with patients experiencing bothersome tinni-
tus (Cima et al., 2019; Tunkel et al., 2014), but researchers 
have estimated that only about half (50.6%) of patients 
with tinnitus discuss the issue with a medical professional 
(Bhatt et al., 2018). Although there are many treatments 
for 
bothersome 
tinnitus, 
cognitive 
behavioral 
therapy 
(CBT) and hearing aids have had consistent empirical sup-
port (Hesser et al., 2011; Manchaiah et al., 2020; Search-
field et al., 2010; Shekhawat et al., 2013). Importantly, 
clinical guidelines devised by Cima et al. (2019) note that 
hearing aids are recommended for patients who present 
with hearing loss and tinnitus, but not for those who do 
not have hearing loss. Recent clinical guidelines also 
strongly recommend the delivery of CBT to patients suf-
fering from bothersome tinnitus (Cima et al., 2019; Tunkel 
et al., 2014). Despite these guidelines, in one study, Bhatt 
et al. (2018) found that more patients report discussing 
hearing aids with a medical professional (9.2%) than CBT 
(0.2%); they also found that other behavioral treatments 
for tinnitus were discussed more often than CBT, includ-
ing tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT; 3%) and stress 
reduction (6.7%). 
Since CBT for tinnitus has substantial empirical sup-
port, it is concerning that it is so rarely discussed with 
patients, especially compared to other, less empirically 
supported behavioral treatments. There are multiple bar-
riers that may be contributing to this discrepancy, such as 
a lack of familiarity with tinnitus among mental health pro-
viders (e.g., psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers), 
issues of insurance coverage, and others. Attending to these 
barriers would increase access to CBT for tinnitus, but it is 
important to know whether patients would choose to 
receive the treatment if they had the chance. If CBT is pro-
spectively less acceptable to patients, it may be discussed 
less often in initial tinnitus treatment consultations. To 
determine the best steps to take to improve access to empir-
ically supported care for tinnitus, we must first understand 
how these treatments are perceived by people with bother-
some tinnitus. As a result, we sought to determine whether 
patients would perceive CBT more or less acceptable than 
other, less empirically support treatments if it were dis-
cussed with them. For this study, we will consider and 
compare 
the 
following 
treatments 
for 
tinnitus: 
CBT, 
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and TRT. 
Notably, because our study was designed to examine indi-
vidual treatment approaches, we decided not to include 
stepped 
care 
models 
or 
other 
treatment 
models 
that 
combine multiple approaches such as progressive tinnitus 
management (PTM; Henry et al., 2010). 
The goal of  CBT  for tinnitus is to reduce tinnitus-
related distress through psychoeducation, cognitive restruc-
turing, and teaching the patient skills (e.g., progressive 
muscle relaxation, challenging negative thoughts, shifting 
attention, and others; Beukes et al., 2021; Greimel & 
Kröner-Herwig, 2011). There is substantial empirical sup-
port for the efficacy of CBT for tinnitus, and it is strongly 
recommended by clinical guidelines for treating tinnitus 
(Cima et al., 2014, 2019; Hesser et al., 2011; Manchaiah 
et al., 2020; Tunkel et al., 2014). Similar to CBT, the goal 
of MBSR is to reduce tinnitus-related distress. MBSR 
employs mindfulness meditation as a main mechanism 
(Kabat-Zinn, 2003; Roland et al., 2015). Although there is 
less evidence for the efficacy of MBSR when compared to 
CBT, some studies have found mindfulness-based treat-
ments 
to 
reduce 
tinnitus-related 
distress 
(Rademaker 
et al., 2019; Roland et al., 2015). 
TRT attempts to leverage the neuroplasticity of the 
brain’s auditory system to habituate to the sound of tinni-
tus, decreasing the intensity and frequency of one’s per-
ception of their tinnitus (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2000, 
2006). Patients engage in retraining counseling and sound 
therapy (Jastreboff & Jastreboff, 2000). Although there 
are some studies suggesting the efficacy of TRT for reduc-
ing tinnitus-related distress (e.g., Bauer et al., 2017), other 
results have inspired less optimism (e.g., Scherer et al., 
2019). The latter finding of TRT showed no clear advan-
tage over standard care among veterans. Cima et al.’s 
(2019) clinical guidelines for tinnitus treatment do not pro-
vide a recommendation for the use of TRT on the basis of 
a lack of high-level evidence for its effectiveness. 
Tinnitus and Veterans 
Tinnitus is the most common service-related disabil-
ity claim of military veterans (Karch et al., 2016; Myers 
et al., 2014). Veterans are exposed to unique tinnitus risk 
factors, including industrial noise, auditory trauma, and 
blast exposure (Burns-O’Connell et al., 2019; Karch et al., 
2016; Kreuzer et al., 2014; Moring et al., 2018). Blast 
exposure is an issue specifically related to recent military 
engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan and is associated 
with the incidence of tinnitus, traumatic brain injury, and 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Carlson et al., 2019; 
Kreuzer et al., 2014; Moring et al., 2018). These three 
diagnoses often complicate each other, as veterans with 
both tinnitus and PTSD report more disturbance than 
those with only tinnitus (Fagelson, 2007; Fagelson & 
Smith, 2016). Furthermore, tinnitus in both civilian and 
veteran samples is associated with anxiety and depression 
(Bhatt et al., 2017; Carlson et al., 2019), and tinnitus is

also associated with substance use in a veteran sample 
(Carlson et al., 2019). Researchers have also identified sev-
eral unique aspects of veteran populations that complicate 
tinnitus treatment, including the comorbidity of tinnitus, 
traumatic brain injury, and PTSD and a higher chance 
of low health literacy, particularly in senior veterans 
(Rodríguez et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2018). 
Acceptability of Treatments 
Treatment acceptability is an often ill-defined con-
cept, as many research teams have measured acceptability 
in different ways, such as with retention and recruitment 
rates (e.g., Jones et al., 2018), thematic analysis of qualita-
tive interviews (e.g., Finucane & Mercer, 2006), compli-
ance rates (e.g., Scheutzow et al., 2022), `or others. 
Sekhon et al. (2017) have provided a comprehensive and 
multifaceted framework of acceptability, including compo-
nents such as affective attitude, burden, and perceived 
effectiveness in their definition. An important component 
of this framework is the understanding that acceptability 
ratings can be taken before (prospective), during (concur-
rent), or after (retrospective) partaking in a treatment and 
that each holds value for comprehensively understanding 
acceptability (Sekhon et al., 2017). We decided to follow 
this framework for measuring acceptability, supplementing 
our measurement with an established measure of credibil-
ity and expectancy, which appeared to us to overlap with 
the concept of acceptability. 
This Study 
In this study, we were interested in comparing how 
veterans and nonveterans prospectively rated CBT, MBSR, 
and TRT for tinnitus on credibility, expectancy, and overall 
acceptability items. We were interested primarily in pro-
spective ratings because we believe they will most closely 
capture the experience of receiving a diagnosis and discuss-
ing treatment options with a health care provider. We had 
two main hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that CBT for 
tinnitus would not be the highest-rated treatment across 
our three outcome variables, meaning TRT, MBSR, or 
both would be rated higher than CBT. Previous research 
has shown CBT to be less discussed by medical providers 
and patients (Bhatt et al., 2018), which may be indicative 
of lower ratings of credibility, expectancy, and acceptabil-
ity. Second, we hypothesized that veterans would rate all 
three treatments lower on all three outcome variables than 
nonveterans. This hypothesis stems from research that dem-
onstrates a multitude of related complications to tinnitus 
often observed in veteran populations (Carlson et al., 2019; 
Fagelson, 2007; Karch et al., 2016). Veterans with compli-
cated cases of tinnitus may perceive that available treat-
ment options do not adequately address their specific needs, 
leading to overall lower ratings of credibility, expectancy, 
and acceptability.

Method 
Participants 
Our sample consisted of 129 veterans and 148 nonvet-
erans that we recruited using Prolific, an online research 
platform. Prolific is free to join, is open to adults residing in 
a variety of countries, and sets a minimum hourly rate for 
payment. Participants must verify their identity before being 
allowed to participate in research studies in order to protect 
data quality. Once verified, participants fill out demographic 
questionnaires in order to match them with research studies 
seeking to recruit participants like them. Prolific participants 
are then provided with a list of studies they meet criteria for 
that includes a brief description of each study, the time 
requirement for participating, and payment. They may then 
select and participate in any studies from that list, which 
periodically refreshes with more studies. 
All 277 of our participants were over the age of 
18 years, were fluent in English, resided in the United States, 
and self-reported ringing in their ears. All participants also 
reported at least a nonzero level of bothersome tinnitus on 
an item from the Tinnitus Functional Index (Meikle et al., 
2012), “Over the past week how bothered have you been 
because of your tinnitus (ringing in the ears).” This was to 
ensure that participants had at least some level of psycholog-
ical distress accompanying their auditory distress as sug-
gested by recent multidisciplinary models of tinnitus (Cima 
et al., 2019; De Ridder et al., 2021). On a scale from 0 to 
10, veterans who participated in the study had an average 
rating of 4.42 at screen. Nonveterans who participated in the 
study had an average rating of 4.38 at screen. 
All 129 veterans reported military service in the 
U.S. Armed Forces. Participants were not eligible to be 
included in the veteran sample if they reported service in a 
military other than that of the United States. All 148 non-
veterans reported no prior or current military service.

questionnaire that asks participants to rate a treatment 
based on their thoughts and feelings about that treatment. 
Set 1 asks participants to answer based on what they think 
about the treatment. Set 2 asks participants to answer 
based on how they feel about the treatment. Aside from 
Item 4 in Set 1 and Item 2 in Set 2, which ask participants 
to choose a percent rating from 10% to 100%, the CEQ 
was scored on Likert-type scales with options ranging from 
1 to 9. Two distinct factors, expectancy and credibility, 
have high internal consistency (Devilly & Borkovec, 2000). 
The expectancy factor, composed of the final question from 
Set 1 and both Set 2 questions, displayed satisfactory 
internal consistency for each of our treatment conditions: 
CBT (α = .96), MBSR (α = .96), and TRT (α = .95). The 
credibility factor, composed of the first three questions 
from Set 1, also displayed satisfactory internal consistency: 
CBT (α = .91), MBSR (α = .92), and TRT (α = .90).

Acceptability Items 
In addition to the CEQ, we added a series of seven 
self-report items adapted from Sekhon et al. (2017). All 
items were scored on Likert-type scales similar to the

satisfactory internal consistency (α = .90) for each of our 
treatment 
conditions. 
We 
also 
calculated 
Cronbach’s 
alpha for these questions and the six items of the CEQ 
(see Results). 
Tinnitus Severity Short Form 
The Tinnitus Severity Short Form (TS-SF; Frumkin 
et al., 2021) is a 10-item self-report questionnaire that asks 
participants to rate statements about their tinnitus symp-
toms over the past week. In this data set, the TS-SF dis-
played excellent internal consistency (α = .95). 
Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 
The Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5 (PC-
PTSD-V; Prins et al., 2016) is a six-item self-report question-
naire used to screen for PTSD. The first item briefly assesses 
if the respondent has experienced a traumatic event, followed 
by five diagnostic items. In our sample, these five diagnostic 
items displayed acceptable internal consistency (α = .80). 
Procedure 
The study was approved by the institutional review 
board of a private university in the Midwest and preregis-
tered (https://osf.io/djtsy) before data collection began. 
Participants completed the informed consent process at 
the beginning of each survey by reading an information 
sheet about the study so they could decide whether they 
wished to participate. Participants were recruited online 
through a study posting on Prolific. All participants with 
a profile matching our inclusion criteria (i.e., over the age 
of 18 years, residing in the United States) gained access to 
the screening survey by seeing it appear in the list of stud-
ies they could participate in. We posted two separate 
screening surveys, including one that we made available to 
potential participants indicating past military experience 
and one that we made available to participants who 
reported no past military experience. We screened 304 
participants for the veteran group and 500 participants for 
the nonveteran group. Of those screened for the veteran 
group, 31 were ineligible because they did not report mili-
tary service, 71 were ineligible because they did not report 
any current tinnitus, and eight were ineligible because they 
reported no bother from their tinnitus in the past week. 
Of those screened for the nonveteran group, 23 were ineli-
gible because they reported prior military service, 200 
were ineligible because they did not report any current tin-
nitus, and 13 were ineligible because they reported no 
bother from their tinnitus in the past week. After screen-
ing, we opened our main survey to 194 eligible veterans 
and 264 eligible nonveterans.
https://osf.io/djtsy). Descriptions were reviewed 
by all authors for accuracy prior to data collection. 
In the main survey, participants answered ques-
tions about their mental health, tinnitus symptoms, and 
demographics. Participants then viewed one of three writ-
ten descriptions of a treatment for tinnitus (CBT, MBSR, 
or TRT) and were asked to complete items related to the 
respective treatment description.2 These questions con-
sisted of the CEQ (Devilly & Borkovec, 2000) and accept-
ability items adapted from Sekhon et al. (2017) to assess 
credibility, expectancy, and acceptability of each treat-
ment. Descriptions of treatments included a summary of 
their research support, with the statement for CBT for tin-
nitus indicating the strongest research support of the three. 
Participants then viewed the next two descriptions of 
treatments for tinnitus, again in random order, until they 
had viewed and answered questions about each of the 
three treatments. 
2 Descriptions of CBT, MBSR, and TRT that were presented to par-
ticipants can be found on the Open Science Framework preregistra-
tion for this project (
To participate in studies posted on Prolific, potential 
participants are asked to fill out questions to help match 
them with studies. Questions assess demographics, jobs 
and work experience, and other domains. We used some 
of this information for our study, including past military 
experience, gender, age, ethnicity, and hearing difficulties 
(i.e., 
“Do 
you 
have 
any 
hearing 
loss 
or 
hearing 
difficulties?”). 
We completed all analyses in R, using the following 
packages: rstatix (Kassambara, 2021), lavaan (Rosseel, 
2012), psych (Revelle, 2022), lme4 (Bates et al., 2015), 
effectsize (Ben-Shachar et al., 2020), and esvis (Anderson, 
2022). We first calculated Cronbach’s alpha to evaluate 
the internal consistency of our acceptability items with the 
CEQ. We conducted confirmatory factor analyses with all 
of the items from the CEQ and all of our acceptability 
items to determine whether these items would be best rep-
resented by a single-factor model. In evaluating the fit of 
our models, we relied on the Tucker–Lewis incremental fit 
index (Tucker & Lewis, 1973), the comparative fit index 
(CFI; 
Bentler, 
1990), 
the 
root-mean-square 
error 
of 
approximation (RMSEA; Steiger & Lind, 1980), and the 
standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR; Bentler, 
1995). Recommendations for model fit index cutoffs based 
on the work of Hu and Bentler (1999) were considered. 
We chose to use the robust maximum likelihood estimator 
to fit our models. For simplicity, we also chose to explore 
the factor structure using data from a single treatment 
condition (CBT) instead of all three treatments. Once we 
established the factor structure, we roughly standardized 
our variables before running a mixed analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) with repeated measures.

A Priori Analyses 
Cronbach’s Alpha 
Cronbach’s alpha for individual measures is listed in 
the Materials section. The acceptability items displayed 
satisfactory internal consistency across each treatment 
condition and indicated that all items were positively cor-
related: CBT (α = .85), MBSR (α = .84), and TRT (α = 
.84). Item–total and item–whole correlations displayed 
low internal consistency with the second acceptability 
item (i.e., How much effort is required to participate in 
this treatment?). Once this item was removed, internal 
consistency improved across each treatment: CBT (α = 
.90), MBSR (α = .90),  and TRT (α = .90). Cronbach’s 
alpha for the combination of the six CEQ items and six 
remaining acceptability items was excellent for all three 
treatments: CBT (α = .96),  MBSR  (α = .96), and TRT 
(α = .96).  
Confirmatory Factor Analysis 
Including all of the CEQ items and all of the accept-
ability items except for the one that was removed in the 
above section, we fit three models before reaching ade-
quate fit: a single-factor model (CFI = .83, TLI = .79, 
RMSEA = .21, SRMR = .06), a three-factor model 
(CFI = .93, TLI = .91, RMSEA = .14, SRMR = .06),

Mixed ANOVA 
Due to the data fitting a three-factor model, we con-
ducted three 2 (veteran and nonveteran) × 3 (CBT, 
MBSR, and TRT) mixed-model ANOVAs with repeated 
measures to examine each of our outcome variables (credi-
bility, expectancy, and acceptability) instead of the origi-
nally 
planned 
single 
ANOVA. 
Veteran 
status 
varied 
between 
subjects, 
and 
ratings 
(credibility, 
expectancy, 
acceptability) of treatments varied within subjects. 
ANOVA results are displayed in Table 3. Across all 
three analyses, there were significant main effects of vet-
eran status (ps < .035), such that veterans provided signifi-
cantly lower ratings. There were also significant effects of 
treatment (ps < .015). There were no interactions between 
treatment and veteran status (ps > .350). 
Pairwise t-test results with Bonferroni correction can 
be found in Table 4. 
Post Hoc Analyses 
Although our analyses suggested differences in credi-
bility, expectancy, and acceptability ratings between vet-
erans and nonveterans, it is also true that these two 
groups typically differ across multiple demographic char-
acteristics that may have confounded our a priori results.

To further examine the robustness of the effect of veteran 
status on our outcome variables, we checked to see 
whether other variables significantly differed between vet-
erans and nonveterans in our sample and whether any 
such variables might be associated with the effects we 
observed in our a priori analyses.

Linear Mixed-Effects Models 
Further testing revealed that, of the variables that dif-
fered across veteran status, only reporting hearing difficulties 
had an association with credibility, expectancy, and accept-
ability ratings. Thus, we used linear mixed-effects models 
with repeated measures to determine the extent to which vet-
eran status, reporting hearing difficulties, and the interaction 
between these two variables were predictive of credibility, 
expectancy, and acceptability scores. Across all three models, 
there were significant effects of veteran status (ps <  .001,  
η2 = .010–.030) and hearing difficulties (ps < .01,  η2 = 
.009–.020) but no significant interactions (ps > .450).  
Discussion 
We hypothesized that CBT for tinnitus would not 
be rated the highest of the three treatments across all three 
of our outcome variables (credibility, expectancy, and 
acceptability). This hypothesis was partially supported, as 
TRT was rated significantly higher than CBT and MBSR 
in terms of credibility and expectancy. Although TRT 
acceptability scores were higher than CBT acceptability 
scores, this effect was not significant after Bonferroni cor-
rection. Although the description of TRT noted that 
research on its efficacy was mixed, providing less strong 
research support than CBT or MBSR, TRT was rated 
more favorably than the other treatments. Thus, it appears 
that having more research support was not necessarily asso-
ciated with being a credible and effective treatment. 
We also hypothesized that veterans would rate all 
three treatments less favorably than nonveterans across 
each of our outcome variables. This hypothesis was sup-
ported, as veterans rated credibility, expectancy, and 
acceptability lower than nonveterans. Furthermore, this 
finding was robust in post hoc testing that examined dif-
ferences between veterans and nonveterans on other mea-
sured variables, including gender, highest level of educa-
tion completed, and tinnitus severity. This finding may 
reflect the oftentimes complex nature of tinnitus among 
veterans due to a multitude of complicating factors, 
including concurrent diagnoses (Carlson et al., 2019; 
Kreuzer et al., 2014), occupational auditory risks (Moring 
et al., 2018), and the possibility of low health literacy 
(Rodríguez et al., 2013). In our sample, veterans were 
more likely than nonveterans to report hearing difficulties, 
which may have been a complicating factor. Such factors 
may lead to veterans being less willing or able to under-
stand new treatments or more pessimistic about treatment 
efficacy if their tinnitus is complicated by other diagnoses, 
auditory trauma, or hearing difficulties. We also found an 
unexpected significant effect of reporting hearing difficul-
ties on credibility, expectancy, and acceptability. It is 
possible that hearing difficulties are attributed to a more 
physically identifiable cause than subjective tinnitus. Com-
pared to treatments for hearing difficulties that are able to 
directly address the presenting problem (e.g., a patient can 
use hearing aids to directly improve their hearing), behav-
ioral treatments for bothersome tinnitus may appear less 
overtly helpful. Treatment initiatives designed for veterans 
will need to be mindful of credibility, expectancy, and 
acceptability, and providers may need to address veteran 
concerns. Since PTM, the stepped care model utilized in 
the Veterans Affairs system, includes CBT for tinnitus for 
patients whose bothersome tinnitus does not subside at 
lower levels, efforts to accurately describe CBT and 
address veteran-specific concerns early may aid with reten-
tion. It would also be useful to test, in future studies, 
whether veterans would respond more favorably to CBT 
if it were described as being part of PTM. 
Considering these results against the backdrop of 
current clinical guidelines for tinnitus treatment, there is a 
clear disconnect between recommended practices in the 
management of tinnitus and perception of the credibility, 
expectancy, and acceptability of these treatments among 
the lay population. The empirical support of CBT for tin-
nitus and its prominent inclusion in current clinical guide-
lines (Cima et al., 2019; Tunkel et al., 2014) did not trans-
late to higher credibility, expectancy, or acceptability rat-
ings among participants with bothersome tinnitus. Partici-
pants instead favored TRT, a treatment that is not a core 
component of current clinical guidelines. These findings 
provide further evidence for the need of health care pro-
viders to have conversations with patients about current 
options to manage their tinnitus, as well as to provide 
brief education on the multidisciplinary nature of tinnitus 
discussed by De Ridder et al. (2021). 
Furthermore, these results may have implications 
for training health care professionals. Our findings suggest 
that even if access to CBT for tinnitus were increased by 
familiarizing primary care and mental health providers 
with treatments for tinnitus, barriers to empirically sup-
ported care may persist. Further research will be required 
to identify specific strategies for helping to improve the 
perception of empirically based treatments such as CBT 
for tinnitus, but focusing on accurately describing the 
treatments, 
addressing 
common 
misconceptions 
about 
tinnitus and each treatment, and taking the time to respond 
to patient concerns may be a useful starting point. 
Limitations 
Some limitations must be noted. First, these ratings 
of credibility, expectancy, and acceptability were collected 
from participants who did not expect to actually receive 
any of the treatments during their participation. Although

there is clear value in understanding prospective accept-
ability, further research will be needed to understand con-
current and retrospective acceptability of these treatments 
as well (Sekhon et al., 2017). It is possible that partici-
pants would rate the treatments differently while actively 
undergoing each intervention, which would further our 
understanding of the specific aspects of each treatment 
that participants prefer. Furthermore, it would be interest-
ing to learn if participants’ attitudes about each treatment 
change after participating in them. 
Second, since our study sample was composed of 
people who self-reported some level of bothersome tinnitus 
in the past week, it does not allow us to specifically exam-
ine ratings from treatment-seeking patients with tinnitus. 
Treatment-seeking participants would arguably be most 
important to survey for credibility, expectancy, and accept-
ability ratings, but our study was not designed to differenti-
ate between treatment-seeking and not–treatment-seeking 
people with tinnitus. 
Third, we did not assess duration of tinnitus in this 
study. Duration of tinnitus may have an effect on the pro-
spective credibility, expectancy, and acceptability of treat-
ments and will need to be examined in future work. 
Conclusions 
The finding that veterans and nonveterans rated 
TRT higher than CBT or MBSR on credibility and expec-
tancy measures, as well as rated TRT higher than MBSR 
on an acceptability measure, provides avenues for future 
investigation. First, although we would expect patients to 
consider treatments with more empirical support more 
credible, this does not appear to necessarily be the case in 
our sample. Second, further investigation will be necessary 
to determine what specific aspects of these treatments are 
more and less acceptable. In addition, the finding that vet-
erans and those reporting hearing difficulties rated all 
three treatments less favorably across all three outcome 
variables compared to nonveterans or those without hear-
ing difficulties has important public health implications. 
Researchers have already identified veterans as a poten-
tially difficult population to reach for treatment (e.g., 
Rodríguez et al., 2013), and our findings appear to sup-
port this concern. Future research is needed to further 
examine the significant difference between veterans’ and 
nonveterans’ perceptions of credibility, expectancy, and 
acceptability, as well as how best to reach patients who 
are skeptical of treatments for tinnitus. Furthermore, these 
findings suggest a divide between current clinical guide-
lines for tinnitus and public perceptions of treatment effi-
cacy. As a result, these findings provide further evidence 
for the need to have educational conversations between 
health care providers and patients to explain the options 
available to manage bothersome tinnitus.
