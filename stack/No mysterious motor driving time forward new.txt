Abstract 
In this work, we address the concept of time within classical physics with the aim of solving 
some old questions concerning the definition of time and the conflict between the time 
reversibility of classical physics and the time irreversibility observed in every physics system. 
We start from a mathematical definition of time based on the intuitive idea that time is an 
attribute of movement or change, an attribute perceived by the observer through the action of 
wait. In this definition, the wait, a mind-dependent concept, is mathematically related to 
successive positions or path of movement, giving birth to an objective time. It is shown that 
time defined in this way possesses all the properties of the time of physics, and is necessarily 
reversible for deterministic motion having uniqueness of path prescribed by the principle of 
least action. However, time irreversibility emerges for indeterministic (random) motion 
occurring over multiple paths. A mathematical proof of time irreversibility is formulated by 
using path probability. The possibility to characterize time irreversibility using path entropy is 
also discussed.

1) Introduction 
As a millennium-old puzzle, time continues to elude us; many open questions can be traced 
back to the beginning of our civilization [1][2][3][4]. Today we know very well how to measure 
time with moving objects (moon, earth, sun, heart-beating or clocks). However, we do not know 
what time is. We do not know how to define it. Many even refuse or do not want to define it. 
We do not understand many of its essential properties and behaviors. Despite all the progress 
in science, we can hardly say that the apprehension of time has progressed since Aristotle [2] 
and Saint Augustine [3]. This paper presents the result of an effort to make some progress in 
this seemingly dead-end situation in the understanding of time.  
We have noticed that time has a remarkable dual character. On the one hand, the concept 
seems familiar to all. It is everywhere and at every instant in everyday life. Time is one of the 
most employed word in every language. To feel time, we just need to look at a clock or 
something moving around, or to close our eyes and to wait for the break of dawn in bed during 
a sleepless night. An animal can feel time as well when, for example, a hungry dog waiting for 
food with impatience. It is taken for granted that time is familiar to everybody. This is one of 
the reasons as to why many have thought that the definition of time is useless. Newton wrote, 
when he used time as a mathematical variable in the equation of motion, that it is unnecessary 
to define time because everybody knows it [5]. Pascal wrote approximately the same thing 
before Newton1 [6]. As time is everywhere in Nature, in human society, in our everyday life 
and consciousness, it is a remarkable multidisciplinary concept. Not only physicians can dig 
into it, philosophers, sociologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, and presumably all scientists 
from any domain of sciences are entitled and have the authority to talk about time from different 
angles and apprehensions. 
On the other hand, time is one of the hardest topics in science, especially in physics. It’s 
true nature is still a mystery today. Strangely enough, as a so familiar concept and a 
indispensable mathematical variable in science, time does not have a rigorous and unanimous 
definition. There are some conceptual definitions, such as time is 'mobile image of eternity' [1], 
'number of movement' [2], 'order of succession' [4], or 'measure of movement' [6][7]. None of 
                                                 
1 … le temps est de cette sorte. Qui le pourra définir ? Et pourquoi l'entreprendre, puisque tous les 
hommes conçoivent ce qu'on veut dire en parlant de temps, sans qu'on le désigne davantage ? [6]

these definitions is clear-cut enough to be immune from confusion. Today the confusion is such 
that we can mention a crisis of time: it would be very difficult to make an exhaustive list of the 
different interpretations and understandings of time 2 [9]-[21]. 
One of the fundamental mysteries of time is the conflict between the time irreversibility 
observed everywhere in nature where time eternally heads from the past to the future, and the 
time reversibility in the fundamental laws of nature in which the past and the future are 
symmetric. The only time irreversible law, the second law of thermodynamics, has been 
interpreted as a statistical property emergent from the time reversible laws [17], meaning that 
the second law is no longer a fundamental law of physics; it may or may not happen, and can 
be violated with small likelihood3 [22]. This conflict is one of the causes of the impressive 
divergence of understanding of time.  
In this work, we propose a solution of this conflict by introducing mathematical tools into 
the study of time within classical physics4. We think that a rigorous definition of time is now 
necessary to make progress in the understanding of time. Thus, our starting point is a 
mathematical definition of time relating time to the path of motion. Such a definition, the first 
one in physics to our knowledge, is helpful for eliminating confusion about the nature of time 
and for proving rigorously time irreversibility with mathematical tools.  
                                                 
2 We just give some examples here. Time does not exist [9][10]. The passage of time is an illusion [11]. Time 
irreversibility is a statistical impression, meaning time is reversible, albeit with small probability [12]. Time is 
reversible in deterministic physics [13]. Time arrow (not time itself) comes from quantum randomness or 
uncertainty [14][15][16]. Time arrow emerges from thermodynamics as a statistical property [18]. Time arrow 
emerges from chaos [18], and from the initial conditions [19][20]. Time itself (not only its arrow) emerges from 
quantum world [19][21]. 
3 In [22] it is proved that the second law of thermodynamics has an unbreakable connection to the laws of energy 
and mass conservation, so that its violation would lead to the failure of these laws and of the most if not all of the 
laws of physics and chemistry. Therefore the second law is as fundamental as the laws of conservation of energy 
and mass. 
4 As mentioned in the above footnote, there has been efforts to understand time from quantum considerations 
[14][15][16][19][21]. In our opinion, quantum interpretation of time is premature in the context of today’s 
incomplete understanding of quantum world itself. Besides, time flowing from past to future is omnipresent in the 
macroscopic world where quantum efforts are absent or negligible. It is hence necessary to solve the time puzzle 
in classical world in first place before looking into the time of quantum world.

2) What is time? 
a) Can we define time? 
By definition of time, we mean a mathematical expression of time as a function of other 
more fundamental quantities than time. Such a definition has been considered unnecessary or 
impossible [5][6][25] simply because time is always considered one of the most fundamental 
and primitive quantities in physics5, as primitive as space for example. This explains why, 
despite the intuitive and reasonable idea associating time with movement [1][2][4][6][7], time 
has never been considered a function of space, or more precisely, a function of movement in 
space, and has always been regarded as a quality independent of and parallel to space [7]. We 
would remark that this old belief that time cannot be defined is, as a matter of fact, not well 
founded because the proponents themselves ignore what time is, making their assertion about 
time little credible. 
Our proposition about the definition of time is the following. The universally accepted point 
of view that time is associated with movement comes directly from the intuition that time is 
only quantitatively perceptible when something moves or changes [7]. If nothing changed, there 
would be no measurable time. Thus, time is always measured with moving objects, examples 
include the sun, earth, moon (the very first clocks of human beings), the pendulum, the arms of 
clocks, and today’s most developed atomic clocks. If we look carefully into this connection 
between time and movement, it becomes obvious that time is placed at the same epistemic level 
as movement. Movement is changing position. We must admit that movement can only occur 
or be well defined when there is well defined positions. Position is defined in space, or positions 
form space [7]. By this consideration, time becomes unquestionably less primitive than space, 
                                                 
5 … je reviens à l'explication du véritable ordre, qui consiste, comme je disais, à tout définir et à tout prouver. 
Certainement cette méthode serait belle, mais elle est absolument impossible : car il est évident que les premiers 
termes qu'on voudrait définir, en supposeraient de précédents pour servir à leur explication, et que de même les 
premières propositions qu'on voudrait prouver en supposeraient d'autres qui les précédassent; et ainsi il est clair 
qu'on n'arriverait jamais aux premières. Aussi, en poussant les recherches de plus en plus, on arrive nécessairement 
à des mots primitifs qu'on ne peut plus définir….C'est ce que la géométrie enseigne parfaitement. Elle ne définit 
aucune de ces choses, espace, temps, mouvement, nombre … parce que ces termes−là désignent si naturellement 
les choses qu'ils signifient … que l'éclaircissement qu'on en voudrait faire apporterait plus d'obscurité que 
d'instruction. - Blaise Pascal, De l'esprit géométrique.

not the inverse, as argued in [7]6. This point of view means that defining time as a function of 
space is not impossible. 
b) How to define time? 
It is helpful to think once again about the assertion of Aristotle that time is the number of 
motion according to before and after [2]. Here the number means measure of time with given 
unit, day, month, years etc. [7]. Aristotle insisted that the essence of time is movement, as he 
discussed at length in his Physics [2]. But he did not specify the property and the form of this 
link to movement. Bergson went farther in the analysis of the concept of time by introducing 
the pure duration of consciousness, kind of sensation of wait with patience or impatience, 
defined as a succession of certain states of consciousness [7]. He illustrated the pure duration 
with the feeling of wait for a sugar to melt in water, but he differentiated it from the time of 
physics7 [8]. Certainly, state of consciousness is not state of physics of a movement; but a state 
of consciousness of the observer can be connected to a state of physics (position) by the action 
of observation of the position. Similarly, a succession of states of consciousness, represented 
by the feeling of wait, can be connected to a succession of positions by a series of simultaneous 
observations. To put it differently, the pure duration can be spread out, by the action of wait 
                                                 
6 For if time, as the reflective consciousness represents it, is a medium in which our conscious states form a discrete 
series so as to admit of being counted, and if on the other hand our conception of number ends in spreading out in 
space everything which can be directly counted, it is to be presumed that time, understood in the sense of a medium 
in which we make distinctions and count, is nothing but space ([7] p.91).  
   If, then, one of these two supposed forms of the homogeneous, namely time and space, is derived from the other, 
we can surmise a priori that the idea of space is the fundamental datum ([7] p.99). 
7 Si je veux me préparer un verre d'eau sucrée, j'ai beau faire, je dois attendre que le sucre fonde. Ce petit fait est 
gros d'enseignements. Car le temps que j'ai à attendre n'est plus ce temps mathématique qui s'appliquerait aussi 
bien le long de l'histoire entière du monde matériel, lors même qu'elle serait étalée tout d'un coup dans l'espace. Il 
coïncide avec mon impatience, c'est-à-dire avec une certaine portion de ma durée à moi, qui n'est pas allongeable 
ni rétrécissable à volonté. Ce n'est plus du pensé, c'est du vécu (If I prepare a cup of sweet water, I must wait for 
the sugar to melt …the time of my wait is no more the mathematical time which would apply along the whole 
history of the material world when it is spread out over space. It coincides with my impatience, i.e. with a portion 
of my own duration which is neither extensible nor shrinkable. It is no longer thinking, it is lived [8] … Pure 
duration is the form which the succession of our conscious states assumes when our ego lets itself live… ([7] 
p.100).

and observation, over a succession of positions of a motion. This consideration opens the way 
to a definition of time as presented below. 
We will avoid the words such as before, after, duration, elapse, period, anterior, posterior 
etc. in defining time, because these terms are too often associated to time in common languages. 
Using them may give an impression of self-referential definition of time [25]. We propose 
instead to use the term wait. As mentioned above, wait is the sensation experienced by the 
observer of movement, i.e., the observer must wait in order to perceive the succession of 
positions one after another. The ability of waiting, or the action of wait for something in the 
future, is an instinctive and innate capability of human being and of most if not all animals; it 
is a basic capability guaranteeing their survival, just as the capability of perceiving position 
correctly to find things necessary for their life or to protect themselves from danger. The word 
wait is familiar to everybody and easier to understand than the abstruse concept of pure duration 
of consciousness8 whose origin is still under active investigation today [26]. 
c) Definition of time 
To start the introduction to our approach to a definition of time, it is helpful to move our 
mind away from the familiar concepts of space-time, velocity, acceleration etc., and to go back 
to the cognitive context before modern physics as early as 14th century when there was no 
calculus using time. Many scholars of that time, Buridan and Oresme among others, tried to 
investigate the relationship between the mobility (they called it quality) of motion and time 
[28]. They took time as a primitive variable without defining it, and expressed the quality (Q) 
as a function of time. To our knowledge, this is the first use of time as mathematical variable 
because Oresme expressed Q as vertical axis in a figure where time is horizontal axis. A uniform 
motion is represented by a constant quality (horizontal straight line) in Oresme's figure [28], in 
which the spatial position of moving object or the distance L covered by the motion can be 
defined by the area below the straight line between the initial time 𝑡0 and final time 𝑡𝑓, i.e., 𝐿=
                                                 
8 The concept of wait does coincide with the pure duration of Bergson. The difference is that wait is a concrete 
action of our innate ability of perceiving successive positions (or states of physics) with the help of the memory 
recording the past positions until the present one, while the pure duration of Bergson is an abstract and obscure 
concept belonging to consciousness and independent of the external physics world. The innate ability of perceiving 
successive positions is a potential of action of wait. There is no duration in it. The feeling of duration can take 
place when the action of wait occurs with the perception of successive positions or events.

𝑄(𝑡𝑓−𝑡0). We will follow this approach in replacing time by space as horizontal axis because 
we do not know yet time, but space is already well defined.  
First, let us consider a whole space containing immobile objects, each one being at its fixed 
position. There is no motion at all. To characterize this space, a fixed spatial position x for each 
object is enough. Let us suppose a primitive but smart geometer who is observing this space, it 
is enough for him to measure the positions of the objects and to establish a map as a complete 
description of the space (an ensemble of x values). He does not need any other parameter than 
the positions x. There is no change, no duration, no elapsed time. 
Now the objects start to move. The space becomes a movie instead of a picture. The map 
of the geometer is no longer sufficient. In order to describe the changing space, the geometer 
starts to look for some rules of the motions by studying the moving bodies. At a given moment, 
he measured a body at position 𝑥0. He waits a little, the body has changed its position from 𝑥0 
to 𝑥1. He waits a little bit more, the body reaches 𝑥2, so on and so forth. The primitive geometer 
does not have yet the notion of time, he only feels wait between successive positions. He is 
smart enough to realize that this wait can be used to describe the changing positions of the 
objects in the space. He begins to study of the relationship between his wait and the changing 
positions by studying a simplest motion: a moving body that seems uniformly traveling the 
distance with a constant quality. He measures his wait throughout this uniform motion using 
his heartbeat as Galileo did [29], using 𝑡1 to denote the wait from 𝑥0 to 𝑥1, 𝑡2 from 𝑥1 to 𝑥2, 𝑡3 
from 𝑥2 to 𝑥3 and so on until the final point of a motion 𝑥𝑁. He quickly notices the following 
relationships between the consecutive waits and positions: 
𝑡1
𝑡2 =
𝑥1−𝑥0
𝑥2−𝑥1, 
𝑡2
𝑡3 =
𝑥2−𝑥1
𝑥3−𝑥2, …
𝑡𝑖
𝑡𝑖+1 =
𝑥𝑖−𝑥𝑖−1
𝑥𝑖+1−𝑥𝑖…  
which implies an underlying rule linking the waits to the distances  
𝑡i = 𝑞(𝑥i −𝑥i−1 ) 
(1) 
where 𝑖= 1,2 … 𝑁, and q is the quality (mobility) of the motion relating his wait to different 
distances.  
He realizes that different uniform motions have different qualities, and that the quality of 
non-uniform motion varies as a function of the position. He then establishes a figure, à la 
Oresme, where position x is the abscissa and the quality 𝑞1 is the ordinate. A uniform motion 
has a horizontal straight line in his figure. Different uniform motions are represented by 

 
 
 
8 
 
horizontals of different heights. His wait is then the area under the lines between the initial and 
final points (Figure 1). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Representation of the quality q of two motions. The left one describes a uniform 
motion with a horizontal line indicating its quality 𝑞1, The hatched area is the wait 𝑡1 =
𝑞1(𝑥1 −𝑥0 ). The right one describes a motion with varying quality 𝑞2(𝑥) as certain 
function of position x. The wait of this motion is given by 𝑡2 = ∫
𝑞2(𝑥)
𝑥3
𝑥2
𝑑𝑥.  
It is worth mentioning that to express the wait in Eq.(1) as a function of positions and of the 
quality of motion is not an arbitrary choice by our geometer. He does not have other choice 
because only spatial positions are well defined. Once the wait 𝑡 is defined with Eq.(1) and 
measured as he did with his heartbeats, the quality 𝑞 can be determined from Eq.(1). Notice 
that 𝑞 (inverse speed) is an intrinsic quality directly related to the energy of the moving body.  
Now the geometer wants to communicate and discuss his study of moving bodies with 
colleagues, who say the wait he has counted is not credible because his heart rhythm is unstable. 
These colleagues cannot repeat his measurements because different persons in different mental 
states would have different heart rhythm and read differently the wait of a given movement. 
The only solution is a compromise to take a stable, controllable and familiar motion as standards 
of wait and to compare other waits of different movements to the standard. Examples of the 
standard includes the apparent motion of the sun, of the moon, hourglass, pendulum, arms of 
clock, atomic clock etc. as happened in the history of metrology of time. In this way, the wait 
defined by Eq.(1) gives birth to the time of physics, losing its mental dependence, and obtaining 
its objective and mind-independent character from the path of motion.

To summarize, time is nothing but an attribute of movement corresponding to the wait of 
the observer for perceiving successive positions. More generally, time is the wait necessary for 
perceiving successive states (values) of any changing quantity.  
d) Time and path of movement 
One of the objectives of this work is to associate time with the trajectory of motion. From 
Eq.(1), we can naturally write 𝑡= ∑
𝑡𝑖
𝑁
𝑖=1
= 𝑞(𝑥𝑁−𝑥0) for uniform motion and 
𝑡= ∑𝑞𝑖(𝑥𝑖−𝑥𝑖−1)
𝑁
𝑖=1
 
(2) 
for non-uniform one, where t is the time of the motion over the path (𝑥0, 𝑥1, 𝑥2, … 𝑥𝑖… 𝑥𝑁). 
Eq.(2) relates the time t of a movement to its path. If the path is a continuous line between 𝑥0 
and 𝑥𝑁, we have 
𝑡= ∫
𝑞(𝑥)𝑑𝑥
𝑥𝑁
𝑥0
 
(3) 
In case where 𝑞(𝑥) is position independent (uniform motion for instance), Eq.(3) reads 𝑡= 𝑞𝑙 
where 𝑙= ∫
𝑑𝑥
𝑥𝑁
𝑥0
 is the length of the path of the motion. A very special uniform motion whose 
quality is not only independent of position but also independent of the reference frame is the 
light motion for which 𝑡= 𝑙/𝑐 (𝑞= 1/𝑐) is valid for any reference, where 𝑐 is the speed of 
light in vacuum. This allows using light as a universal standard of time, as discussed below. 
3) What behind the name of time? 
a) Objectivity of time 
Eqs.(1) to (3) offer an unambiguous definition of an objective time for physics, since this time 
is completely determined by the mind-independent path of motion. No confusion is possible 
about its nature. As stated above, time is just an interval, perceived by the observer via the 
feeling of wait, between two consecutive positions of a same moving object, or two consecutive 
values of any measurable changing quantity, such as temperature, pressure, light intensity, 
frequency etc. No doubt is possible about its objectivity, as long as space (or the changing 
observables used in the definition) is objective. In this way, the objectivity of time is guaranteed 
by the objectivity of the observed changing quantities. Within the definition Eq.(1), one cannot 

 
 
 
10 
 
say time does not exist or is illusionary [9][10][11], unless he considers position illusionary, 
which is irrelevant in physics. 
b) Subjective time dilation 
Nevertheless, as the time of Eq.(1) is a wait, and the feeling of wait is experienced by our 
mind always affected by emotion or by the nature of the observed movement [27], a given time 
duration may be perceived differently, depending on the mental state of the observer or on the 
nature of the movement [27]. It is a common knowledge that our emotions warp our perception 
of time (one minute seems longer for someone suffering than for someone enjoying himself). 
However, this mental effect is by no means a proof of the subjectivity of the time of physics. 
An advantage of Eq.(1) is that it removes the mind-dependent character of wait by connecting 
it to the objective positions.  
c) Relativity of time 
The relativity of time is a very important property of the time of physics. It is related to the 
famous time dilation due to relative motion and gravitation [23][24]. This property of time is 
sometimes puzzling for many because, if time is an objective quantity in nature, why is it 
observed differently by different observers? Does this hint that time is not objective at all and 
just a mind-dependent variable and spurious concept9 [9][10][25]? Here we will show that the 
objective time of Eq.(1) inevitably possesses this relativistic property. 
One of the important characteristics of Eq.(1) is that time is a relative quantity delimited by 
at least two consecutive events. Therefore, on the one hand, absolute time of a single position 
or event does not make sense. What we call time is nothing but an interval (duration) between 
two successive events. It is useless to imagine a time other than duration between events. It is 
a common knowledge that a time moment associated with a single event in our common 
language is always calculated with respect to another time moment of an event (reference).  
On the other hand, as positions and paths movements are reference-dependent, reference-
independent absolute time does not exist. Time defined by Eq.(1) must inherit the relativistic 
character of position and path. This naturally leads to the dilation of time due to relative motion. 
                                                 
9 We may therefore surmise that time, conceived under the form of a homogeneous medium, is some spurious 
concept, due to the trespassing of the idea of space upon the field of pure consciousness ([7] p.98).

Considering that light motion is reference-independent, we can use it as a universal standard to 
measure time in all references with 𝑡= 𝑞𝑙 (𝑞= 1/𝑐) as has been done in special relativity [23] 
using light clock with two mirrors reflecting a photon in the vertical direction. Now use 𝑡= 𝑞𝑙 
for two inertial references , we obtain  𝑡=
𝑡0
√1−(𝑉/𝑐)2
10, where 𝑡0 is the proper time of a clock 
during the up-down motion (measured in the reference co-moving with the clock), and 𝑡 is the 
time of the clock during the same motion but observed in the other reference in which the clock 
is flying at a speed V in the horizontal direction. Similarly, using 𝑡= 𝑞𝑙, we can show that the 
perception of the simultaneity of two events also depends on references [24]. The gravitational 
time dilation is natural to understand as well with light clocks (the speed of light is independent 
of gravity). Gravity warps space and the paths of movement, time defined by Eq.(1) is therefore 
naturally affected by gravity [24].  
We mention here these well-known results of relativity theories in order to show that they 
are a natural consequence of the definition of time by Eq.(1) relating time to the path of motion. 
They are by no means the reasons for killing time as asserted by many [9][10][25]. 
a) Zeno’s paradoxes of motion 
Now we have connected time to the path of motion, it is of interest to say some words about 
Zeno’s paradoxes of motion which are directly related to time and space [2]. The solution of 
these paradoxes has motivated many philosopher from Aristotle [2] until Bergson [7] during 
more than two thousand years, and is still open questions today [30]. It should be noticed that 
in Zeno’s paradoxes and all the relative discussions, time and space are always separated and 
considered independent from each other. Here we will show that, if time is connected to the 
path of motion, many Zeno’s paradoxes simply disappear.  
                                                 
10 For an observer who is immobile with respect to the light clock, the length of the path of the photon in an up-
down movement is 2ℎ  where ℎ is the distance between the two mirrors. The time of this motion is given by Eq.(3), 
i.e. 𝑡0 =
2ℎ
𝑐, also called the proper time of the clock. Now suppose that the clock starts to move in the horizontal 
direction with respect to the observer at a speed V. As the speed of light is the same for the observer and in the 
reference co-moving with the moving clock, the proper time does not change. But the length of the path of the 
photon in an up-down motion recorded by the observer is now √(𝑐𝑡0)2 + (𝑉𝑡)2 where t is the time of the moving 
clock during an up-down motion read by the observer, we must have 𝑡=
√(𝑐𝑡0)2+(𝑉𝑡)2
𝑐
 and 𝑡=
𝑡0
√1−(𝑉/𝑐)2.

A typical Zeno’s paradox is Dichotomy proposed to show that all motions are illusory. A 
version of it states that a motion can never start because the moving body, in order to reach its 
goal at a distance 𝐿, must travel the first half the distance 
𝐿
2. And before doing this, the body 
must travel the first quarter  
𝐿
22, and the first eighth  
𝐿
23, first sixteenth 
𝐿
24, so on and so forth ad 
infinitum. Finally, the distance d covered by the moving body becomes 𝑑=
𝐿
2∞= 0, implying 
the body cannot move, so the motion can never start. Never meaning forever. There is a forever 
or eternity because there are indeed infinite operations to halve the distance to travel. Each 
operation takes a finite duration of time in general, leading to infinite amount of time or eternity.  
However, Zeno’s arguments can no longer hold once time is related to the path of motion 
as in Eq.(3). For simplicity, suppose a uniform motion with a constant velocity 𝑉 (quality), the 
time 𝜏  of the motion should be 𝜏=
𝐿
𝑉. If now we halve the distance 𝐿 to travel, the time  𝑡 of 
the motion is also halved 𝑡=
𝜏
2. If we halve the distance ad infinitum, we also halve the time of 
the motion ad infinitum, leading to 𝑡=
𝜏
2∞= 0. The time for the body to make the first move 
becomes zero, implying that the motion does not have time to start, which is totally different 
from that the motion can never start. There is no Never (infinite amount of time) at all because 
the time necessary for the motion to occur is fuirtively reduced to zero by taking advantage of 
the disconnection between time and space. Zeno’s sophistic trick is clear. This solution also 
applies to the paradox of Achilles and Tortoise and the Arrow paradox. 
4) From uniqueness of path to time reversibility 
Defining time by Eqs.(1) to (3) is as natural and intuitive as reading time in the changing 
positions of the arms of a clock. It is the simplest way to see what is called time. Nevertheless, 
people have tried to find it elsewhere outside movement for many reasons. One of them may 
be the paradox between the reversibility of movement (and time as well) prescribed by the laws 
of physics and the irreversibility of time in nature where these laws seem to apply perfectly. 
Finding a solution of this paradox is the main objective of this work. Let us first discuss the 
sign of time, which is necessary since there seems no unanimous understanding of the negative 
sign (−𝑡) we are used to write in front of the (forward) time 𝑡 [34].

a) What is time reversal 
As defined in Eqs.(1) to (3), time of a motion is perceived by the observer through his 
sensation of wait. Wait gives the feeling of increasing duration. So naturally, we tend to give a 
positive sign to the time of the observed motion along a trajectory. We accept the convention 
that a forward motion has positive and increasing time 𝑡. Given this choice, what does mean if 
we write −𝑡? 
Now let 𝑞(𝑥) in Eq.(3) be the quality of a motion along its trajectory in the direction with 
positive 𝑡, then −𝑞(𝑥) implies the inversion of the sign of forward quality at every point on the 
path, yielding an opposite motion along the same trajectory, just as the rewind of a video of 
motion. If a real motion can be rewound in this way, it is able to go back and retrieve all its past 
positions. We say that the motion is reversible. If a system completely recovers its past, we can 
say that its time is reversed. Mathematically, this reversal can be represented by a negative time. 
Let t' be the time of the inverse motion, we have 𝑡′ = ∫
−𝑞(𝑥)𝑑(−𝑥)
𝑥0
𝑥𝑁
= −∫
𝑞(𝑥)𝑑𝑥
𝑥𝑁
𝑥0
=
−𝑡. This means that the reversibility of time in a motion is a consequence of the reversibility of 
that motion. More generally, the time reversibility of a process means that the process itself is 
reversible, i.e. capable of retrieving its past states11. 
b) Reversibility, uniqueness of path, principle of least action 
It is trivial to show that all motions obeying Newtonian equation of motion 𝐹= 𝑚𝑑2𝑥𝑑𝑡2
⁄
 
are time reversible since this equation does not change when you replace 𝑡 by – 𝑡 in the second 
derivative. As a consequence, both 𝑥(𝑡)  and 𝑥(−𝑡) are solutions of Newtonian equation, i.e., 
movements that can actually happen. There is no time arrow in classical mechanics. The origin 
of this time symmetry is in a fundamental principle of classical mechanics. To explain this, let 
us notice that all classical mechanical motions are characterized by the uniqueness of path 
between two spatial points for given time duration (or for given initial states). This path, in the 
                                                 
11 In case of biological processes, the growth of a plant for example, if time of the plant was reversible, it would 
be able to go back to its past, i.e., retrieving all its past states of a younger plant. We suppose that the states of 
plant are completely determined by the ensemble of the states of all the molecules and atoms in the plant. 
Therefore, the time reversal of a plant to a given past moment is a process having – 𝑡, retrieving all the molecules 
and atoms it has lost since (the dead leaves for example) in shrinking (abandoning all the molecules and atoms it 
has gained since that time), but also get them back at the same states as that past moment. 

 
 
 
14 
 
case of a Hamiltonian system conserving energy, is the path of least (or stationary) action, a 
rule announced for the first time by French scientist Maupertuis then developed further by 
Lagrange and Hamilton [31]. The action, denoted by 𝐴, can be defined by the time integral of 
Lagrangian function ℒ along a path between two spatial points [31] a and b : 
𝐴= ∫ℒ𝑑𝑡
𝑏
𝑎
 
(4) 
where the Lagrangian ℒ has different forms for motions of different nature, and turns out to be 
time symmetric with ℒ(𝑡) = ℒ(−𝑡) [31]. Hence, along the same path, the forward action from 
a to b, 𝐴𝑎𝑏= ∫ℒ(𝑡)𝑑𝑡
𝑏
𝑎
, turns out to be equal to the action of the backward motion: 𝐴𝑏𝑎=
∫ℒ(−𝑡)𝑑(−𝑡)
𝑎
𝑏
= −∫ℒ𝑑𝑡
𝑎
𝑏
= ∫ℒ𝑑𝑡
𝑏
𝑎
= 𝐴𝑎𝑏. As this action is the least one, the forward 
motion and the backward one must follow the same unique path. Hence, the basic principle and 
the concomitant laws of motion do not have preference of direction of time on the unique path. 
In other words, along the least action path, 𝑡 and −𝑡 are both possible, the past can be the future, 
and the future can be the past. From a known present state, the state of a movement is 
predictable with precision for any moment in the future, and can as well be traced back to any 
moment in the past. We call this kind of motions deterministic. All deterministic motions 
prescribed by the principle of least action are time reversible and characterized by uniqueness 
of path. 
5) When and how can time be irreversible?  
According to the above analysis, all motions obeying the principle of least action must be 
time reversible. This explains why the laws of physics which can be derived from this basic 
principle are all time reversible. The question is how and why, in all systems supposedly 
governed by those time reversible laws, time is always irreversible? If each of the components 
of an ensemble is white, but the ensemble is not white, there must be something else in play. 
This point is now tackled in what follows. 
a) Multiplicity of path of random motion 
Strictly speaking, deterministic motion as described above does not exist in nature. The 
uniqueness of path has never been observed in real motions, all motions in nature being more 
or less random with unpredictable future states. One may object to this assertion by saying that 
all motions in nature obeying Newtonian laws have uniqueness of path and predictability. The 

 
 
 
15 
 
movement of the earth around the sun is an example. This is true only for sufficiently short time 
period. If the period of observation is sufficiently long, all the uncertainties in the unpredictable 
variation of the masses of the sun and of the planets of solar system will make earth’s motion 
uncertain, finishing by canceling the uniqueness of its path (orbit) prescribed by the principle 
of least action. All random motions have a common character, i.e., leaving a given state, a 
system can go to different destination along multiple paths, or go to a given final state along 
different paths as illustrated in Figure 2. We also call this kind of motion indeterministic. 
 
Figure 2: A simulation of the paths of a random motion between two points on x-axis, 
𝑥= 0 𝑚 and 𝑥= −4 𝑚, for a given duration of 16 seconds. The moving body is subject 
to a weight and to a random perturbation by Gaussian noise. 
 
Indeterministic motion along the different paths is no longer predictable. As a probabilistic 
motion, it must be described with the help of path probability, i.e. each time the moving body 
leaves the starting point (𝑥= 0 𝑚 in Figure 2), it takes a given path with a given probability 
towards the end point (𝑥= −4 𝑚 in Figure 2). Let 𝑝𝑗= 𝑝(𝑄𝑗) be the probability for the body 
to follow the path j represented by (𝑥𝑎, 𝑥1, 𝑥2, … 𝑥𝑖… 𝑥𝑏)𝑗 in discrete step i=0, 1, 2, …N (N can 
be very large) between two spatial points a and b, where 𝑄𝑗 is a path-dependent quantity along 
the path j and determines the probability for the path j to be taken.  

 
 
 
16 
 
However, the existence of the path probability 𝑝𝑗= 𝑝(𝑄𝑗) with a well defined 𝑄𝑗 is not 
self-evident for all random motions. For the time being, existence of this probability has only 
been proved for Hamiltonian systems in random motion with statistically conserved energy 
[35]-[38]. In the case of randomness created by Gaussian noises, 𝑄𝑗 is just the action 𝐴𝑗 along 
the path j, and 𝑝𝑗 is an exponential function of action: 𝑝𝑗∝exp (−𝛾𝐴𝑗), where 𝛾 is a positive 
constant characterizing the randomness [35]-[38].  
Our following discussions of time in indeterministic motion are limited to the systems 
having this path probability as a function of action. If a system is not Hamiltonian or exchanges 
energy with its environment, such as a Brownian particle, the existence of 𝑝𝑗= 𝑝(𝐴𝑗) is not 
guaranteed. In this case, we should include the environment of the system in such a way to form 
a larger Hamiltonian system having path probability for a sufficiently long period. Logically, if 
a large system is time reversible, each of its subsystems must be time reversible. If a large 
system is not time reversible, its subsystems, being interdependent in general, cannot be time 
reversible either. For example, the motion of a Brownian particle contained in water, considered 
isolated, cannot be time reversible if the ensemble of water+Brownian particle is not, even if 
the Brownian particle seems to retrieve several of its past states. This is because there are always 
something missing in the retrieved past states due to the irreversibility of the ensemble (a 
molecule of the water has not come back to its past position in interaction with the Brownian 
particle for instance).  
b) Irreversibility from multiple paths 
When position and paths are continuous, the probability of a path j is given by 𝑑𝑝𝑗=
 𝜌(𝑄𝑗)𝐷𝑥, where 𝜌(𝑄𝑗) is the path probability density distribution and the differential 𝐷𝑥 
represents the "width" of the path (see Figure 3) given by the product of all the tolerances 𝑑𝑥𝑖 
at each one of the N positions 𝑥𝑖: 𝐷𝑥= 𝑑𝑥1𝑑𝑥2 … 𝑑𝑥𝑁. Note that 𝑥𝑎= 𝑥0 is the fixed initial 
point so 𝑑𝑥𝑎= 𝑑𝑥0 may or may not be included. The normalization of this path probability is 
calculated with the path integral technique [41]:  
∑
𝑑𝑝𝑗

𝑑𝑥1
∞
−∞

𝑑𝑥2
∞
−∞
… ∫
𝑑𝑥𝑁−1
∞
−∞
𝜌[𝑄(𝑥𝑎, 𝑥1, 𝑥2, … 𝑥𝑖… 𝑥𝑏)] = 1   
where the sum over the index j is replaced by the integral over all 𝑑𝑥𝑖 (i=1, 2, …N-1, 𝑥𝑁= 𝑥𝑏 
is fixed). 

 
 
 
17 
 
Now consider Eq.(2) defining time 𝑡= ∑
𝑞𝑖𝑗
𝑁
𝑖=1
(𝑥𝑖−𝑥𝑖−1)𝑗 over a path j between a and b. 
Suppose 𝑡 is positive during the forward motion from a to b, and becomes negative for the 
inverse motion from b to a (when the sign of all the 𝑞𝑖's is reversed).  Let 𝜌[𝑄(𝑥𝑎, 𝑥1, 𝑥2 … 𝑥𝑏)𝑗] 
be the probability density of the forward motion along the path (𝑥𝑎, 𝑥1, 𝑥2 … 𝑥𝑁−1, 𝑥𝑏)𝑗, and 
𝜌[𝑄(𝑥𝑏, 𝑥𝑁−1 … 𝑥1, 𝑥𝑎)𝑗] the probability density for the inverse motion on the same path. The 
probability for the forward motion along the path of width 𝐷𝑥𝑎𝑏= 𝑑𝑥1𝑑𝑥2 … 𝑑𝑥𝑁 is given by 
𝑑𝑝𝑗(𝑎, 𝑏) =  𝜌[𝑄(𝑥𝑎… 𝑥𝑏)𝑗] 𝐷𝑥𝑎𝑏. The probability of the backward motion on the same path 
j with the width 𝐷𝑥𝑏𝑎= 𝑑𝑥𝑁−1 … 𝑑𝑥1𝑑𝑥𝑎 is given by 𝑑𝑝𝑗(𝑏, 𝑎) = 𝜌[𝑄(𝑥𝑏… 𝑥𝑎)𝑗]𝐷𝑥𝑏𝑎. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3: A 1-dimensional path of N steps along x axis from a and b, illustrated in space-
time x-t. The hatched band represents the width 𝐷𝑥= 𝑑𝑥1𝑑𝑥2 … 𝑑𝑥𝑁. The width of the 
path at the step at 𝑥𝑖 is given by the tolerance 𝑑𝑥𝑖. It is obvious that if one of the N 
tolerances 𝑑𝑥𝑖 is zero, the path is at once deadlocked since its width 𝐷𝑥= 0. 
 
Notice that the probability of a given path, in the case of continuous variation of position 
and of infinite number of paths, is proportional to the width 𝐷𝑥 of the path. The smaller 𝐷𝑥, 
the thinner the path, the smaller its probability. This implies that the probability is zero along a 
path of width 𝐷𝑥= 0. More precisely, the path probability 𝑑𝑝𝑗=  𝜌(𝑄𝑗)𝐷𝑥= 0 if anyone of 
the N widths 𝑑𝑥1, 𝑑𝑥2, … 𝑑𝑥𝑁 is zero, i.e., the path is deadlocked (see figure 3). This property 
of the path probability does not affect the motion (forward or backward) of a particle that is free 
to move on and to explore all possible space with liberty, with no constraint on the width of any 
step. However, constraints on the width of path may occur for the motions that are required to

go somewhere with certain precision. To reverse a motion for example, we require the motion 
to reach its past states. Below we discuss two constraints coming from two different kinds of 
reversed motion which we referred to as strong reversibility and weak reversibility.  
c) Strong time reversibility,  
Strong time reversibility means the motion is reversed in such a way that the moving object 
retrieves, step after step, all its past positions. In this way, the moving object experiences again 
all its past, as if nothing had happened and the world is the same as before. Let (𝑥𝑎→ 𝑥1 →
 𝑥2 … →𝑥𝑁−1 → 𝑥𝑏) be the forward path, and (𝑥𝑏→ 𝑥𝑁−1 → … 𝑥1 →𝑥𝑎)  the backward 
path, where each reversed position 𝑥𝑖 must be exactly the same as the forward 𝑥𝑖. No deviation 
of backward 𝑥𝑖 from the forward 𝑥𝑖 is tolerated. Any deviation, even infinitesimal one, would 
mean the moving body is not returning to its past so that its time is not reversed. Hence, the 
width of the inverse path must be strictly zero at every inverse step, leading to 𝐷𝑥𝑏𝑎=
𝑑𝑥𝑁−1 … 𝑑𝑥1𝑑𝑥0 = 0 and to the zero probability for the backward motion along a certain path 
j: 𝑑𝑝𝑗(𝑏, 𝑎) = 𝜌[𝑄(𝑥𝑏… 𝑥𝑎)𝑗]𝐷𝑥𝑏𝑎= 0. The inverse motion along a path is possible only with 
nonzero width 𝐷𝑥𝑏𝑎≠0, meaning that the deviation of backward 𝑥𝑖 from the forward 𝑥𝑖 for 
all i is nonzero. This implies that the backward path is not exactly the same as the forward one, 
so the moving object is not experiencing a return to its past, and time is not reversed. The 
backward path becomes dead-ended whenever we want to produce time inversion by imposing 
𝐷𝑥𝑏𝑎= 0. To summarize, the probability of inverse motion producing time reversal is always 
zero along any already realized path.  
d) Weak time reversibility 
Weak time reversibility means the moving body continues its forward motion without 
reversing the sign of 𝑞𝑖's in Eq.(3), and turns out to revisit at least one of its past positions, 
making a circular motion. Similar return to the past occurs in science fiction when someone 
travels back in time and meets himself of twenty years ago, or his parents when they were 
younger. This circular motion also occurs with the eternal return of Poincaré in his recurrence 
theorem [39]. For simplicity, let us suppose that the moving body starts its motion at the point 
𝑥𝑎= 𝑥0, and, without reversing its time course, comes back to 𝑥𝑎 at the step N (𝑥𝑁= 𝑥𝑎) on 
the path (𝑥𝑎→ 𝑥1 → 𝑥2 … →𝑥𝑁−1 →𝑥𝑎). The probability of this path, numbered by j, is 
given by 𝑑𝑝𝑗(𝑎, 𝑎) = 𝜌[𝑄(𝑥𝑎, 𝑥1, 𝑥2 … 𝑥𝑁−1, 𝑥𝑎)𝑗]𝐷𝑥𝑎𝑎 with 𝐷𝑥𝑎𝑎=  𝑑𝑥1𝑑𝑥2 … 𝑑𝑥𝑁−1𝑑𝑥𝑎. 
If we do not impose time reversal to the whole path, none of the N widths in the product 

 
 
 
19 
 
𝑑𝑥1𝑑𝑥2 … 𝑑𝑥𝑁−1𝑑𝑥𝑎 is zero. However, if you want to produce the weak time reversal for the 
moving body to revisit the initial position 𝑥𝑎, you cannot but impose zero tolerance 𝑑𝑥𝑎= 0 at 
𝑥𝑁= 𝑥𝑎, leading to 𝐷𝑥𝑎𝑎= 0, and to zero path probability 𝑑𝑝𝑗(𝑎, 𝑎) = 0 for the return. To 
summarize, it is impossible for the body to revisit even a single past point.  
This result does not contradict the Poincaré's recurrence theorem [39] because it is valid 
only for deterministic motion characterized by the uniqueness of path, while the above result is 
obtained for indeterministic motion characterized by the multiplicity of path. A detailed 
discussion of the modification of Poincaré’s theorem has been given in [40].  
I would like to stress the generic character of the above proof of time irreversibility based 
on a system-independent property of indeterministic motion: multiplicity of paths with well-
defined path probability. Whenever a motion shows this property, it definitively loses the 
possibility to revisit its past. This is the main result of this work.  
In what follows, we discuss this irreversibility from the angle of informational entropy as a 
measure of the dynamic uncertainty of random motion. 
6) Path entropy, a possible measure of irreversibility 
The dynamic uncertainty or the randomness of indeterministic motion can be reflected by the 
informational entropy associated with the path probability 𝑑𝑝𝑗=  𝜌(𝑄𝑗)𝐷𝑥. This entropy has 
been referred to as caliber or path entropy 𝑆𝑝 expressed as a function of path probability with 
Shannon formula 𝑆𝑝(𝑎, 𝑏) = −∫
𝜌(𝑄)ln𝜌(𝑄)𝐷𝑥
𝑎,𝑏
12 [42][43]. 𝑆𝑝(𝑎, 𝑏) is of course a relative 
quantity between the starting point a and the endpoint b of the motion.  Obviously, 𝑆𝑝(𝑎, 𝑏) =
0 if the randomness cancels out between a and b, meaning that the motion is deterministic with 
a single path j of unitary probability 𝑝𝑗= 1. 𝑆𝑝(𝑎, 𝑏) > 0 whenever the motion is random. The 
larger  𝑆𝑝(𝑎, 𝑏) is, the more the motion is uncertain, and the more the paths are dispersed around 
the deterministic path of the system.  
Suppose now a movement from a to b, but passing by a given point c. The path entropy 
𝑆𝑝(𝑎, 𝑏)𝑐 of the motion on this path (𝑎, 𝑐, 𝑏) should be 𝑆𝑝(𝑎, 𝑏)𝑐= 𝑆𝑝(𝑎, 𝑐) + 𝑆𝑝(𝑐, 𝑏). As 
                                                 
12 This formula risks giving negative information measure. A solution to this trouble is proposed in [44] to 
guarantee the positivity of the informational entropy of continuous probability distributions. 

 
 
 
20 
 
𝑆𝑝(𝑎, 𝑐) and 𝑆𝑝(𝑐, 𝑏) are positive by definition [42], 𝑆𝑝(𝑎, 𝑏)𝑐 as a total entropy must be larger 
than each of them. This implies that, as a motion goes on, its total path entropy is an increasing 
function of time. This time increasing property of path entropy can also be proven by reductio 
ad absurdum as follows. Suppose 𝑆𝑝(𝑥𝑎, 𝑥𝑏)𝑐 starts to decrease from the point c to b. This 
means 𝑆𝑝(𝑐, 𝑏) < 0, which contradicts the positivity of path entropy. Hence, as time goes on, a 
system in random motion experiences more and more dynamic uncertainty. This growing 
uncertainty is cumulated in path entropy, making it increasing with time. It seems possible to 
use path entropy to mark the time arrow and to measure the aging of the system in random 
motion. This arrow is always pointing in the direction of increasing uncertainty and disorder, 
as Eddington asserted when he introduced the term 'time's arrow'13 [45]. However, for the time 
being, we don’t know yet how to relate path entropy, a mathematical tool for calculating path 
probability uncertainty, to some measurable physical quantity, thermodynamic entropy or heat 
for example if it concerns thermodynamic systems. Further work is necessary in this direction. 
7) Concluding remarks 
In this work, we have addressed the conflict between the time of physics, which is reversible 
according to the fundamental laws of classical physics, and the irreversible time of nature we 
experience every day. Our starting point is a mathematical definition of time to implement the 
intuitive idea that time is an attribute of movement perceived through the instinctive action of 
wait of the observer to see successive positions. The concept of wait is thus related to the path 
of motion to give birth to time of physics. This definition opens the way to mathematical 
investigation of the properties of time from the properties of the paths of motion. We have 
shown that the time defined in this way has all the attributes of the time of classical physics, 
and is necessarily reversible in deterministic movement.  
The second step of this work is to consider the role of random motion characterized by 
multiplicity of path. We have shown with mathematical proof that, in the case of multiple paths 
                                                 
13 Without any mystic appeal to consciousness it is possible to find a direction of time … Let us draw an arrow 
arbitrarily. If as we follow the arrow we find more and more of the random element in the state of the world, then 
the arrow is pointed towards the future; if the random element decreases, the arrow points towards the past. That 
is the only distinction known to physics. This follows at once if our fundamental contention is admitted that the 
introduction of randomness is the only thing which cannot be undone (Eddington, The Nature of the Physical 
World). 

 
 
 
21 
 
having path probability, time inevitably becomes irreversible. To put it differently, one cannot 
rewind time when it goes on in disordered dynamics. You can never undo the randomness of 
an indeterministic movement. This randomness turns out to be the motor driving time in the 
direction towards increasing disorder and uncertainty14.  
The result of this work is in accordance with the thermodynamic arrow of time and entropy 
increase, with no need of probabilistic interpretation of the second law. In the framework of the 
probabilistic Hamiltonien mechanics based on the path probability, Poincaré's recurrence 
theorem is absent due to the modification of the Liouville's theorem (conservation of phase 
density distribution along the path of the motion), leading to Boltzmann's H theorem (no need 
of molecular chaos [12]) and the concomitant increase of entropy [40]. The probabilistic 
Hamiltonian mechanics invalidates all the arguments of deterministic mechanics against the 
pioneer work of Boltzmann [39][46], including the Maxwell's demon (and other ones [19]) 
haunting the second law of thermodynamics. Indeed, in the context of indeterministic motion 
with multiplicity of paths and uncontrollable randomness of the gas molecules, the demon can 
no more measure the velocity of a molecule with certainty and foresee its direction towards his 
trapdoor. It is useless for him to open the trapdoor to let a fast-moving molecule pass through 
because the molecule may change its direction and its velocity just in front of the door instead 
of going through. In this random world, does the demon himself also show more or less disorder 
in his action? Yes to our eyes because he is living in a ubiquitous randomness. 
It is also worth emphasizing that the indeterministic nature of movement considered in this 
work must be objective in order for the path probability to be objective, leading to observer-
independent time arrow. Subjective and observer-dependent randomness due to incomplete 
                                                 
14 This impossibility of time reversal can be popularized as follows. You leave your car walking away in an open 
field for a while, blindfolded. Then you are asked to return to your car by walking backwards along whatever path 
as you please, you will end up finding your car, perhaps after a long walk. Now you are imposed a constraint to 
walk backwards on the same footprints as your walking away. With the presence of all the uncertainty in the 
measure of step size, in the way you move your legs, and in the irregular form of the ground which you cannot 
see, without mentioning all the other chances you can meet on a wild field, the probability for you to recover your 
car will be very small, eventually almost zero. Now let the size of your footprints and of your feet become 
infinitesimally small (required by the strong reversibility), I am sure that you will lose your car. If, moreover, the 
size of your car tends to zero (required by the weak reversibility), the probability for you to meet again your car is 
zero whichever path you take. 

 
 
 
22 
 
knowledge of deterministic motion, including chaos [12][18], necessarily leads to subjective 
and observer-dependent probability and then to the illusory character of entropy increase and 
time arrow.  
This view is closely related to a philosophy-laden question about the origin of the objective 
randomness in the context of the deterministic laws of classical physics ruling the world. The 
millennium old puzzles opposing determinism against indeterminism, and necessity against 
chance, are well known to all [18][33][34]. The debate seems deadlocked nowadays because 
the absence of irrefutable evidences persists for both deterministic and indeterministic view of 
nature [18][33][34]. In this context, we suggest the following alternative approach to the 
question. In view of the infallible mathematics linking time arrow to multiplicity of path, it is a 
certainty that time loses its reversibility in random motion. Inversely, if a motion is time 
irreversible, it certainly takes place over multiple paths of random motionsd, since the 
uniqueness of path of deterministic motions necessarily yields reversible time. It’s mathematics. 
Therefore, a plausible method to justify the objectivity and the ubiquity of indeterministic 
nature of the world by its time irreversibility, observed everywhere with no counter-example to 
date. Put it shortly, time irreversibility is an evidence of the indeterministic nature of the world.
