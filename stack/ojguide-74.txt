Open Joist
This guide is a supplement to an engineered Floor Framing 
Plan created for a specific job.  Details included in the Floor
Framing Plan take precedence over any other general 
Open Joist framing details contained in this guide.
IMPORTANT:  
Deviation from the engineered Floor Framing 
Plan supplied for a specific job will result in material 
shortages, job delays and possible unsafe installations!  
Do not deviate from the plan without contacting your 
Open Joist representative.

HANDLING, STORAGE 
AND SAFETY
Handle Open Joist trusses upright and by the bottom chord.  Handle 
trusses carefully to avoid damaging them.
Store trusses out of mud and water.
Open Joist floor trusses stored outdoors should be covered for
protection from weather.
In the interest of safety, bundles of Open Joist should remain banded
until ready for use.  Care should be exercised when cutting bands 
on bundles.
Avoid excessive flat-wise bending of Open Joist trusses.  Only use
Open Joist floor trusses for their intended purposes.  Do not use trusses 
for ramps, ladders, etc.
Open Joist trusses are designed for floor framing and may only
be used for roof framing if the roof pitch is 1/2 on 12 or less and 
trusses have been adequately sized.
Distribute piles of building materials (gypsum board, plywood, concrete
blocks, etc.) in small bundles and over bearing supports.  Do not 
overload Open Joist members.  Do not stack materials on trusses that 
have not been properly supported, braced or sheathed to provide 
lateral support.
Do not walk on floor trusses that have not been properly supported
and braced.
For any questions about the correct use of Open Joist floor trusses,
call Open Joist Technical Services at 800-584-5191.

TEMPORARY BRACING
No one should be allowed on the Open Joist floor system until all hangers, blocking, rim 
board and temporary bracing are completely installed.
Open Joist trusses must be held straight and plumb at their design-specified spacing
while all blocking, rim board and bracing are installed.
Temporary bracing is required at all supports and at the interval shown on the drawing
until permanent bracing elements and/or sheathing are installed.
Cantilevered trusses require lateral bracing at ends.
Installation of permanent “strongback” bridging for the purposes of load sharing and
vibration dampening is recommended.  See Framing Details #5 and #5A.  Permanent 
bracing to transmit lateral forces or to provide stability in some applications may be 
required and should be specified by the building designer.

TRIMMING AND ALTERING
Open Joist floor trusses are manufactured in one-foot incremental lengths and 
may be trimmed by a maximum of 11 inches for precision fitting.
A maximum trim 
of 5-1/2” may be 
made on each end of an Open Joist truss,
leaving a minimum of 1-3/4” of the solid end block remaining.  Do not leave 
less than 1-3/4” of remaining end block.
When trimming an Open Joist truss, it is not necessary to trim both ends of 
the truss unless the total amount to be trimmed off is greater than 5-1/2”.  In 
cases where it is necessary to trim both ends of the truss, it is not necessary to 
trim both ends equally.
Special end trims are possible with Open Joist.  A ribbon notch may be cut 
into the end block as long as a minimum of 1-3/4” of the end block remains 
at its narrowest point.  Following the same requirements, angled “bevel cuts” 
or “fire cuts” may be made on the ends of Open Joist trusses for pocket instal-
lation 
or raf-
ter 
clear-
ance.

Only the end blocks of Open Joist trusses may be cut according to the guide-
lines stated.  Top and bottom truss chords and truss webs may not be cut, 
drilled or notched.  Altering these elements will alter the trusses’ structural 
integrity and may result in dangerous conditions.  Cutting, drilling or 
notching chords and webs (other than normal end block trims as 
previously stated) without prior approval from Open Joist Engineering will 
result in the assumption of liability for floor system defects and responsibility 
for repair of such defects by the mechanic who performs unauthorized cutting 
or altering.  Care should be taken during truss layout to allow for adequate 
mechanical clearances so that there will be no need to cut or notch trusses.  
Mechanicals subcontractors should be made aware of these cautions.  If trusses 
have been cut, altered or installed incorrectly, contact Open Joist Engineering 
immediately at 800-584-5191.

Nailing Notes
Caution: When fastening Open Joist trusses, care should be taken to avoid splitting
wooden truss members.
Hangers: Follow hanger manufacturers’ nailing instructions when installing Open Joist
trusses with hangers.
Gussets: Open Joist engineered drawings will specify nailing schedules for attachment
of gussets to trusses for cantilever and point load situations.
Strongback Bracing: When fastening 2X bracing perpendicular to and through OPEN
JOIST trusses, use the following attachments.  When fastening to a vertical web or block, 
use (2) 3” nails fastened to the vertical member only.  When fastening to a diagonal web, 
use (1) 3” nail into the web and (1) 3” nail into the bottom truss chord (see details 
5 and 5A).  Strongback bracing should be nailed in place before decking/sheathing is 
installed.  
Decking/Sheathing: Follow APA recommendations for fastening sheathing to the top chord
of Open Joist floor trusses and rim members.
Screws: Wood screws of sufficient strength may be substituted for nails when fastening
Open Joist floor trusses.
Adhesives: Engineered drawings will specify adhesive requirements where needed for
attachment of gussets, etc.  Using adhesives in addition to fasteners when installing 
decking/sheathing will improve floor system performance.

NAILING AND BEARING CONTINUED
Bearing Requirements
Bearing is any part of a structure (wall, column, pier, etc.) that supports vertical
loads and is itself supported by a footing (a concrete pad under a foundation 
wall or a thickened concrete slab that carries loads down to “undisturbed 
earth”).  Walls, etc. that are not supported by footings are not considered bearing.
Unless indicated otherwise by Open Joist Engineering, minimum bearing
length of 1-1/2” is required to support each end of an Open Joist floor truss 
(see Framing Details 3, 3A and 3B).
Open Joist is a bottom-chord-bearing product that must be supported
by the truss’ bottom chord. To achieve the same framing results as “top-chord-
bearing” or “mid-chord-bearing” trusses, hangers and/or blocking should 
be used.
Open Joist is a simple-span product that must be butted or overlapped
at any intermediate bearing such as a beam or wall.  Open Joist is not designed 
for multiple-span applications.

Each Open Joist floor truss is marked to indicate the top and bottom of the truss.  
Trusses should be installed in the proper orientation as indicated by these 
markings.  To ensure correct installation, make sure the end diagonal web of 
the truss is pointing downward toward the sill plate.

Plumbing, electrical and HVAC systems can be installed around and through the open web 
area of Open Joist floor trusses as long as the truss chords and webs are not cut, notched 
or altered.
Cutting or notching chords and webs (other than normal end block trims)
without prior approval from Open Joist Engineering will result in the assumption of 
liability for floor system defects and responsibility for the repair of such defects by the 
mechanic who performs the unauthorized cutting or altering.  Care should be taken dur-
ing truss layout to allow for adequate mechanical clearances so there will be no need 
to cut or notch trusses.  Mechanicals sub-contractors should be made aware of these 
cautions.
Detail #17 below shows typical through-web clearances for mechanicals.  In addition,
Open Joist floor trusses feature a rectangular chase opening (size varies by truss size) 
located at the center of the truss.
