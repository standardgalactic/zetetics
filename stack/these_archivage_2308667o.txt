Abstract
From numerical simulations, coupling the growth of large scale structure and of dark
matter halos with gas physics, we now understand theoretically that galaxy evolution
involves inows of cold gas from the cosmic web. Galaxies in these cold accretion
models have large amounts of baryons compared to observed galaxies. To overcome this
issue, theorists focus on making star formation inecient by blowing baryons out of star-
forming disks through massive gaseous outows. In my thesis, I explore a dierent road,
investigating processes that may moderate gas accretion onto disks. My methodology is
based on multiphase gas physics honed through studies of the interstellar medium (ISM)
in our own and nearby galaxies over the past decades using analytical modelling and
numerical simulations to follow the gas thermodynamics and structuration from cosmic
web laments to galaxy halos.
In Chapter 2, we present a phenomenological scenario where gas accretion ows  if it
is shocked as it enters the halo as we assume  become biphasic and, as a result, turbulent.
We consider a collimated stream of warm gas that ows into a halo from an over dense
lament of the cosmic web.
The post-shock streaming gas expands because it has a
higher pressure than the ambient halo gas, and fragments as it cools. The fragmented
stream forms a two phase medium: a warm cloudy phase embedded in hot post-shock
gas. We argue that the hot phase sustains the accretion shock. During fragmentation,
a fraction of the initial kinetic energy of the infalling gas is converted into turbulence
among and within the warm clouds. The thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas
is largely determined by the relative timescales of several processes. These competing
timescales characterize the cooling, the expansion of the post-shock gas, the amount of
turbulence in the clouds, and the dynamical time of the halo. We expect the gas to
become multiphase when the gas cooling and dynamical times are of the same order-of-
magnitude. In this framework, we show that this occurs in the important mass range
of Mhalo ‚àº1011 ‚àí1013M‚äô, where the bulk of stars have formed in galaxies. Due to
expansion and turbulence, gas accreting along cosmic web laments may eventually lose
coherence and mix with the ambient halo gas. Through both the phase separation and
disruption of the stream, the accretion eciency onto a galaxy in a halo dynamical time
is lowered. De-collimating ows make the direct interaction between galaxy feedback and
accretion streams more likely, thereby further reducing the overall accretion eciency.
As we discuss, moderating the gas accretion eciency through these mechanisms may
help to alleviate a number of signicant challenges in theoretical galaxy formation.
To establish the likely initial conditions for accretion ows into halos, using the
adaptive mesh-renement code Ramses, I performed a zoom-in simulation of a specic
halo and extracted the results for a particular accreting intergalactic lament into a
‚àº31011 M‚äôat z ‚àº2. This part of my work is presented in Chapter 3. After having
presented the need for a simulation, I briey describe the code Ramses. I investigate the
gas thermodynamics and structuration, along and across the lament, with respect to
dark matter. I study several key quantities as they evolve along the lament and derive
a rened paradigm to study laments, as well as consequences regarding their fate after
v

entering a halo. I nally make use of these results to extrapolate gas processes that the
simulation may not have captured accurately.
In Chapter 4, I oer some conclusions and perspectives on how to extend our phe-
nomenological model presented in Chapter 2 and how the results of simulations from
Chapter 3 relate to our phenomenological results generally. With this thesis I started
exploring and understanding the importance of non-linear gas physics within the context
of large scale structure and global halo-galaxy evolution. I introduced some of the physics
of the multiphase gas, processes which are well known in the ISM, but not well-modeled
within cosmic web laments. I see my work as a rst step towards dedicated numerical
studies for understanding the impact of gas physics on galaxy evolution.

R√©sum√©
Les simulations num√©riques, prenant en compte le couplage des structures d'√©chelle cos-
mique √† la physique des gaz, nous ont appris que l'√©volution des galaxies doit impliquer
un apport de gaz  froid  provenant de la toile cosmique. Les mod√®les en tenant compte
conduisent √† des galaxies plus riches en baryons que celles observ√©es. Pour surmonter ce
probl√®me, les th√©oriciens oisissent de rendre la formation stellaire inecace gr√¢ce √† une
√©jection massive de gaz par les disques en train de former leurs √©toiles. Dans cette th√®se,
j'explore une autre voie, en √©tudiant les processus qui pourraient att√©nuer l'accr√©tion de
gaz sur les disques. Ma m√©thode s'appuie sur la physique des gaz multiphases connue
√† travers les √©tudes du milieu interstellaire de notre galaxie et de ses proches voisines
au cours des derni√®res d√©cennies, √† l'aide d'une mod√©lisation analytique et de simula-
tions num√©riques, pour suivre l'√©volution thermodynamique et structurelle du gaz, des
laments cosmiques aux halos galactiques.
Le chapitre 2 expose un sc√©nario ph√©nom√©nologique dans lequel l'accr√©tion du gaz,
s'il y a un choc viriel, devient biphasique et, en cons√©quence, turbulent.
Nous com-
men√ßons par consid√©rer un courant collimat√© de gaz ti√®de qui s'√©coule dans un halo, √†
l'embouchure d'un lament cosmique. L'√©coulement post-choc s'√©tend puisqu'il a une
pression sup√©rieure √† celle du gaz environnant dans le halo et se fragmente au cours de
son refroidissement. Le milieu comporte alors deux phases : un phase nuageuse et ti√®de
baignant dans le gas rest√© chau√© par le choc.
Nous expliquons en quoi cette phase
chaude supporte le choc. Au cours de la fragmentation, une fraction de l'√©nergie cin√©-
tique est convertie en une turbulence parmi et au sein des nuages ti√®des. L'√©volution
thermodynamique est alors en grande partie d√©termin√©e par les rapports d'√©chelles tem-
porelles de di√©rents processus, √† savoir le refroidissement, l'expansion, la turbulence et
la dynamique propre au halo. On s'attend √† ce que le gaz devienne multiphase quand les
temps de refroidissement et de la dynamique du halo sont comparables. Dans ce sc√©nario,
nous montrons que cela arrive dans la gamme de masses de halo Mhalo ‚àº1011 ‚àí1013M‚äô,
pour lesquelles la majorit√© des √©toiles est d√©j√† form√©e dans les galaxies. L'expansion et la
turbulence peut faire perdre √† terme leur coh√©rence aux laments et entra√Æner leur disso-
lution dans le gaz du halo. La s√©paration des phases et la  disruption  de l'√©coulement
conduit alors √† amoindrir l'ecacit√© d'accr√©tion sur la galaxie en un temps ynamique
du halo. La d√©collimation accro√Æt de m√™me la probabilit√© d'interaction entre le courant
d'accr√©tion et les √©jections galactiques, diminuant d'autant plus l'ecacit√© d'accr√©tion.
Nous discutons enn de l'eet de cette diminution en tant qu'elle permet de r√©soudre un
certain nombre de probl√®mes th√©oriques concernant la formation des galaxies.
An d'√©tablir les conditions initiales propres aux √©coulements d'accr√©tion sur les halos
et qui soient r√©alistes, nous avons utilis√© le code √† ranement adaptatif de maillage
Ramses pour simuler de fa√ßon cibl√©e un lament intergalactique accr√©tant sur un halo
de masse ‚àº3 1011 M‚äô√† z ‚àº2. Cette partie de mon travail est expos√©e dans le chapitre 3.
Apr√®s avoir √©tabli la n√©cessit√© d'une simulation num√©rique, les propri√©t√©s du code lui-
m√™me sont pr√©sent√©es. J'ai ensuite √©tudi√© la thermodynamique et la structuration du
gaz, le long et √† travers le lament, corr√©lativement √† la distribution de mati√®re noire.
vii

J'ai suivi l'√©volution de quantit√©s importantes le long du lament et ai d√©riv√© un cadre
plus judicieux pour l'√©tude des laments, ainsi que les cons√©quences attendues sur leur
destin apr√®s avoir p√©n√©tr√© dans le halo. J'ai enn extrapol√©, √† partir de ces r√©sultats,
certains processus que la simulation pouvait n'avoir pas captur√© avec pr√©cision.
Dans le chapitre 4, je propose des conclusions g√©n√©rales ainsi que les d√©veloppements
possibles de notre mod√®le ph√©nom√©nologique pr√©sent√© au chapitre 2, ainsi qu'une mise
en rapport plus g√©n√©rale des r√©sultats du mod√®le et de la simulation. Au cours de cette
th√®se, j'ai commenc√© √† explorer et √† circonscrire le r√¥le jou√© par la physique non-lin√©aire
du gaz dans le contexte des structures cosmiques et de l'√©volution globale des couples
halo-galaxie. J'ai pu introduire une part de la physique des gaz multiphase, bien connue
en ce qui concerne le milieu interstellaire, mais encore imparfaitement mod√©lis√©e dans
le cadre des laments cosmiques. Ce travail constitue une premi√®r √©tape vers une s√©rie
d'√©tudes num√©riques sp√©cialement d√©di√©es √† la compr√©hension de l'impact de la physique
des gaz sur l'√©volution des galaxies.

Foreword
At the end of the writing of this thesis, I wondered: how is this work in particular
related to science in general? Here is my view on science, and on how my particular
experience relates to it, introducing the outline of this manuscript.
A lot has been written on science, but what results from it, is that there is
no clear and simple formulation circumscribing all of what science is. Is it only a
search for truth? Is it particular because of its usage of mathematics? Is it dened
by a back and forth motion between experiment and theory?
Has it emerged
because of its relative ability to predict? Can it be reduced to the hypothetico-
deductive model?
All of these limiting assertions are way too simple and too
naive.
I will propose here a very crude description of how science works.
Science is the product of social activities of nding correlations in nature, con-
strained by what the agents recorded from nature and by self-consistency, of nd-
ing explanations suciently convincing to improve the overall consistency, and of
keeping a memory of itself.
I intentionally omitted any term like aiming at or trying to.
It is a social activity. Science is made in a collective and organized way. Sci-
entists have to think collectively, then share their ndings and convince of the
reliability thereof. Finding alone and keeping it to oneself is not doing science.
Publishing is neither an end to a scientic process, but rather a step in its course.
Convincing the community is fundamental. It makes science subject to individual
and sociological internal conicts of course. More, since scientists also live in a
broader society, their interactions outside of their eld matter, especially when
metaphysical, ethical or technological questions arise therefrom. This is why sci-
ence is essentially social. But rather than making it awed, this essence makes it
dynamic.
Its internal functioning is also formally, even if not always explicitly, con-
strained.
The constraints come rst from observed data, that is from nature.
But these do not constitute an ultimate guide. One needs to know that no obser-
vation can be categorized as direct or indirect. It is always indirect, mediated by
several physical transformations and observational biases. What are the measured
1

quantities? What do they trace? What is their accuracy? Previously established
models are often needed to simply interpret what is seen in nature, setting up
loops of trust that can be one day broken. Not only is the trust in measurements
dicult to establish, but the way they are represented has much to do with their
acceptation by a scientic community. To nd correlations, certain combinations
of observed quantities are to be tested and this choice may already be a source of
distrust. Is the correlation robust? Is there enough data? What are the odds that
it be coincidental?
After having recognized a new correlation as universal, or at least suciently
general, scientists are eager to provide an explanation. This has nothing to do
with a quest for causality. Explaining correlations consists in forging a symbolic
structure. The most technical way of explaining involves modelling to some degree.
Modelling is an abstract construction of reality which needs:
‚Ä¢ to conceive, that is gathering a minimal set of relevant concepts and detailing
relationships therebetween,
‚Ä¢ to formalize, that is gathering a minimal set of symbolic forms and ordering
them to translate the conceptual links.
Mathematics provide us with a considerably powerful symbolic formalism. And
even if it leaves, in general, no room to doubt when used rigorously, it is rarely
the essence of conviction. The choices lie rather mainly in the conceptualization,
and both requirements of a minimal set and of its relevance are often the heart of
the issue.
A given personal scientic work can also become a game1. So many observations
were made through exploration, guided by a more or less sharp intuition, sometimes
even luck! I can remember a past experimental work I was involved into, where by
playing with the knobs of instruments I found new regimes of a physical instability.
And this exploration is not limited to observation and experiment.
Exploring by means of models may be quite vertiginous and exciting. Given the
existing models, one can extend their results to what has not yet been observed. We
may refer to this as prediction. When scientists extrapolate from already accepted
models, they address the invisible, the unknown. Instead of fabricating a magical
belief related to a mystic world, they keep following the aforementioned constraints
while stating a consistent hypothesis about unknown or unsure situations.
This is what we have done here. Few information from observational instru-
ments indicate the existence of intergalactic laments. Given the expected central
role of laments in shaping the evolution of galaxies, which we will set forth in
1I here mean a game with no competition and sometimes with strict rules, sometimes very
free. In Roger Caillois' words, it would be more alea than ag√¥n, more ilinx than mimicry, and
oscillating between ludus and paidia.

Chapter 1, we chose to address what is not yet known, namely their descriptive
and dynamical properties.
Current knowledge about gas physics at galactic and cosmological scales al-
lowed to consistently envision what could happen to the gaseous laments when
approaching galaxies. We stated that, in common circumstances, microphysics
alone would play such a role that accreting lamentary streams could lose their
identity. The expected timescales of interaction with galaxies and their close en-
vironments are then reassessed. This work is presented in Chapter 2.
A combination of physical, fundamental models with conditions that are cur-
rently considered realistic allows for a mathematical estimation of plausible solu-
tions. Given the complexity of the said conditions, a numerical computation was
used to investigate the state of resulting intergalactic laments. The analyses of
the simulation revealed a possibly complex structuration of lamentary streams
before their entry in a galactic halo, product of an interplay between dynamics
ascribed by cosmic structures and physics specic to a condensing gas. We report
our ndings in Chapter 3.
Both consistently arose from current knowledge but gure new results, whose
in turn are to be tested observationally. This is what would be enjoined by the
empiricism. However, as said before, science can not be reduced to a simple cycle
of hypothesis and falsication.
We may later nd that our results are not as
general as we thought, or new developments may stem from them.
Science is
about acceptance of a nding by a community. I hope that this work will be a
convincing, building brick to erect one new piece of the scientic edice.

Chapter 1
The role of dark matter and gaseous
laments in galaxy evolution
Abstract
Over the last decade, it has been realized that galaxies may acquire much of
their dark matter and baryonic mass through accretion along lamentary struc-
tures.These structures grow gravitationally from small uctuations in the density
eld in the early Universe. Why are intergalactic laments so important to the
eld of galaxy evolution? Such accretion ows shape many of the essential proper-
ties of galaxies, like their shape, their colors, their mass, their gaseous and stellar
contents, and so on. We can only understand galaxy evolution as a balance or
competition between gas accretion, through lamentary structures driven by the
growth of large scale structure, star formation, and the outows intense star for-
mation or active galactic nuclei may produce. But the fuel for all this activity
and galaxy growth are all connected to the way matter has fallen, and is falling,
onto galaxies, in combination with the way they react to the condensation pro-
cesses and outows. Let us revise now the dierent theoretical elements needed to
understand the role played by intergalactic laments (IGFs) in galaxy evolution.

1.1
Cosmological framework
The most fundamental principles governing the characteristics of the Universe, its
expansion rate, mix of baryonic to dark matter, dark energy, its initial primoridial
uctuation spectrum, are all of prime importance for understanding of processes
that shaped the objects in the universe over the last ‚àº13 Gyrs, since the time
of the Big Bang.
The growth and evolution of galaxies is no exception.
The
cosmological conditions are the rst building blocks of any pertinent theory aiming
to explain the history of one given galaxy, and of course, that of the ensemble of
observed galaxies. The most important of these are the rate and rate of change of
the cosmic expansion and the dominance of dark matter over (ordinary) baryonic
matter. These are most consistently explained through variants of the cold dark
matter with a non-zero cosmological constant, the Œõ-CDM, model.
1.1.1
Cosmic expansion
The further the luminous bodies, the longer it took the light to travel from the
source to the observer. But that distance also correlates with a widening of the
wavelengths, making visible light become redderthis is the redshift:
z = Œª ‚àíŒª0
Œª0
(1.1)
that is, the light initially emitted at a wavelength Œª0 is observed at a wavelength
Œª and the redshift z measures, for any wavelength, the light travelling time.
The most satisfying and convincing explanation for redshift is the cosmic expan-
sion. This led to the introduction of a new energy source term Œõ in Einstein's eld
equation of general relativity, called the cosmological constant. The corresponding
fraction of mass-energy density to the one needed to stop the ination (i.e. to
make the Universe at) is ‚Ñ¶Œõ and is estimated from Planck measurements (Planck
Collaboration et al., 2014, 2016) of the CMB to be about 0.69. The linear term in
the rate of expansion of the Universe is the Hubble's constant, H, and its current
value is estimated by the Planck collaboration to be H0 ‚âà67.3 km.s‚àí1.Mpc‚àí1.
The density required for a at Universe is called the critical density and is dened
by:
œÅcrit = 3H2
8œÄG
(1.2)
where G is the gravitational constant. This also means that a given redshift z
also corresponds to a recessional velocity. The further the object, the faster it
apparently recedes from the observer. This phenomenon impacts not only electro-
magnetic waves, but more generally all quantities whose dimension is proportional
7

to a length at some non-zero power. Three simple examples reveal the ubiquity of
the notion, when writing physical models: densities, sizes and velocities.
1.1.2
Dark and baryonic matter
Several peculiarities arose from observations. Rotation curves of galaxies, if one
only considered the distribution of luminous baryonic matter, show unexpected
behaviour at large radii: they are almost at. It was expected from Newtonian
dynamics applied to the mass of detected stars and gas that the orbital speed
should decrease inversely to the distance. More, general relativity allows for light
rays to be bent by masses, resulting in the so-called lensing eect.
From the
deformation of a luminous background, we can derive the value of a mass lensing
it. Surprisingly, lensing galaxy clusters appeared to have a much higher mass than
that computed from its stellar content1. Finally, the study of the cosmic microwave
background led to an oddity: its spatial power spectrum has peaks, signatures
of primordial acoustic oscillations, but their amplitudes were incompatible with
models that only considered luminous matter.
A solution to the three problems is now widely accepted: there exists in the
Universe a massive matter that does not produce radiation, and its mass density
exceeds that of light-emitting matter. The latter is referred to as baryonic matter2,
the former being dark matter (DM), and whose fundamental nature is still unclear.
Neglecting the density of mass-energy of radiation and assuming a at Universe,
the fraction owing to matter is ‚Ñ¶m ‚âà0.31 and, still from Planck measurements
(Planck Collaboration et al., 2014, 2016), the fraction for baryons is ‚Ñ¶b ‚âà0.05,
leaving a fraction of DM ‚Ñ¶DM ‚âà0.26. The ratio fb = ‚Ñ¶b/‚Ñ¶m ‚âà0.16 is called the
baryonic fraction and this cosmic value is considered constant3. This enables us
to write the redshift-dependent Hubble constant:
H(z)2 = H2
0
 ‚Ñ¶m(1 + z)3 + (1 ‚àí‚Ñ¶m ‚àí‚Ñ¶Œõ)(1 + z)2 + ‚Ñ¶Œõ

(1.3)
and, for a at Universe, the middle term of the parenthesis vanishes.
Dark and baryonic matter are thought to follow the same initial distribution
but with dierent amplitudes, in proportion of their cosmic fractions.
This is
referred to as coupling of DM and baryons. The dark matter particles must have
had initial velocities negligible compared to the speed of light to let the models
t with observational data (see below about the large-scale structures) and this is
1We could also add the cases of bound galaxies in superclusters whose dynamics suggested a
higher mass than that derived from total luminous mass in galaxies.
2The term is not the most accurate one: electrons are indeed not baryons, i.e. they are not
sensitive to strong interaction. A more general term could be fermionic matter, since baryons
are composed of quarks, which are fermions like the electrons.
3Neither DM or baryons are produced, destroyed, or converted one into the other.
8

why the currently leading theoretical ground on which astrophysics stands now is
called Œõ-CDM, for non-zero cosmological constant, Œõ, cold dark matter.
1.1.3
Initial density uctuations
Theory suggests that, in the young Universe, the distribution of matter was in
a state of a slightly perturbed but generally homogeneous state. Such a smooth
eld with small uctuations may be considered Gaussian in rst approximation
its Fourier modes have independent imaginary and real parts, which simplied
calculations of its evolution. The phases of these modes are however of prime im-
portance in determining later growth of structure with the density eld. Statistical
properties of those uctuations are derived from the knowledge gained in the last
decades about the cosmic microwave background, notably the power spectrum.
Research on non-Gaussianities is still currently at the frontier of what is known or
knowable. Gravity then drives matter towards regions of highest densities. This
amplication of density peaks has been studied theoretically by means of (early)
linear and (more recent) non-linear analysis.
1.2
Gravity in action
1.2.1
Large scale structures
The consideration of a gravitational and small scale uctuations within the cosmo-
logical density eld in three dimensions led to the prediction that matter should
grow an organized characterizable structure. Dark matter halos sitting at the nexus
of elongated, overdense regions (laments), themselves circumscribing slightly
overdense patches (sheets or walls), themselves enclosing under-dense compart-
ments (voids). We can see it as, at rst, an amplication of distinct features of a
bidimensional density eld: low density valleys get deeper, intermediate density
crests get sharper, and high density summits get higher.
Early views of halo formation
The modelling of the evolving density eld has given a more solid ground to the
idea that density peaks, or halos, grow by acquiring mass from their environ-
ment. After the setup of an ideal, isotropic formulation for a self-similar spherical
collapse, the mathematical developments of tridimensional, anisotropic growth al-
lowed for ellipsoidal (triaxial collapse), rather than perfectly spherical halos. This
more realistic depiction would then support some fundamental explanations for
the strong asymmetry of their observed central luminous components, namely the
galaxies that lie within these dark matter halos. However, even very elongated
9

halos can not t the proles of observed laments, nor can very oblate halos t
the observed sheets.
Detection
The easiest method to detect these particular spatial arrangements of dark matter
was to look at the way galaxies and clusters were distributed in three dimensions
(angular position and redshift). Zeldovich et al. (1982) observed alignments and
aggregation in clusters of galaxies, leaving giant voids in between. de Lapparent
et al. (1986); Geller & Huchra (1989) reported a distribution in sheets bounding
bubbles, now called voids. Klypin & Shandarin (1983) modelled the structures
numerically and found a two-point correlation function in relatively good agree-
ment with observations. Blumenthal et al. (1984); Davis et al. (1985) studied the
structures to nd that the Œõ-CDM paradigm was particularly adapted to numeri-
cally reproducing observations, a work that opened the way to many others.
Fig. 1.1 shows a galaxy distribution slice of a plane in the sky computed from
the galaxies the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In this slice following the north-
ern equatorial plane, lamentary distributions of galaxies (here plotted in each
galaxy's g-r color) are visible. Fig. 1.2 is a snapshot of the Millennium Simulation
(Springel et al., 2005). Represented is the dark matter distribution, also organized
in large-scale structures. Even visually, it is evident that galaxies and dark matter
are both distributed in halos, laments, walls, and voids.
Often described as a honeycomb or form architecture, the pieces of that cosmic
skeleton approximately draws a tessellation of the space, and they were entitled
large-scale structures. In voids, matter ows as if expanding in all directions, as
a negative pressure, until encounters a comparable ow from neighbouring voids,
building panels, or sheets. In turn, matter from the sheets ows as if expanding on
a surface, reaching other sheet-like ows and forming laments. Finally, matter ex-
pands in two directions along each laments, pulled to the regions where laments
meet, namely the halos. This scenario for matter condensation is reminiscent of
the chemical process of reticulation. From massive halos hosting galaxy clusters
down to low-mass, dwarf galactic halos, the larger-scale structures should embed
smaller-scale, similar ones. The model is hierarchical.
Dynamics
The formation and the ows associated with the growth of large-scale structure
can be understood with a simple metaphor: rain, which occupies a tridimensional
volume, falls on a sloping roof and forms a mostly bidimensional sheet, that in
turn runs down to a gutter, giving rise to a thicker but mostly one-dimensional
ow, and the water nally gets trapped into the sink that connects the gutters.

Although useful, this picture proves inadequate, when describing the motion of
the large-scale structures, and the associated deformation of the network. Indeed,
dense structures not only give rise to a gravitational eld, but they also are subject
to it.
Individual structures, as they grow from the surrounding density eld,
will eventually merge with any neighboring halos as they become gravitationally
attracted. It is through this growth pattern where from the concept of hierarchical
growth comes  smaller halos grow and merge to form larger and larger halos. Halos
growth from the small to larger scales, from numerous small low mass halos, into
larger and larger halos.
In that way, halos, albeit pulling matter down their laments, are likely to
ascend in the direction of their shortest feeding lament, pulled by the closest
halo, at the other end. Depending on the mechanical conditions, gravitationally
bound halos (for example, subhalos within a larger more massive one) may orbit
each other. In the same way, laments can exhibit a woven pattern, with their
axes transiently intertwined. Halos may undergo a merger, followed by some of
their laments and nally some of their sheets.
Notwithstanding the cosmic expansion, these dynamics of the large-scale struc-
ture have a measurable impact: the two-point correlation functions should give
dierent results depending on the redshift.
12

1.2.2
Halo growth
Merger mode
From the dynamics of large-scale structures, we have seen that the densest neigh-
boring ones are attracted by each other. Because they travel until they merge
with an similarly moving neighbor, and so on, halos follow a tree-like, or hierar-
chical storyline for their mass growth. The Press-Schechter formalism (Press &
Schechter, 1974) is the earliest attempt to analytically predict the results. In a way,
this paradigm for matter condensation is reminiscent of the process of coagulation
and coalescence.
Accretion modes
As a corollary to the geometry of the large-scale structures and the associated ows,
halos collect matter from laments, but also sheets in the corner of which they sit,
and from voids in the vertices of which they sit. Similarly, laments accrete from
sheets at the intersection of which they lie, but also from voids, Finally, sheets
only receive mass ows from the voids they separate.
Smooth accretion, or (quasi-)spherical accretion corresponds to that coming
from voids. It crosses a typical sphere around the halo with the widest angular
sector but is also characterized by the lowest densities. Then comes the anisotropic
accretion: from sheets (walls, or pancakes, representing the extremely oblate halos
from the triaxial theory), and from laments. The lamentary accretion represents
the densest ows (in both gas and dark matter) and cover the least angular sector
on the spheres they cross.
Describing a halo
Halos, no matter how dark and baryonic matter constitute them, are commonly de-
scribed by geometrical (a radius) and kinematic (a speed) parameters, that in turn
are related to its mass MH and the redshift z. From a model of an initially isother-
mal gas exhibiting an isolated spherical over-density, Jeans derived a criterion to
characterize the scales at which the system would be unstable to a gravitational
collapse. Under the assumption that the system is initially virialized, we can derive
the average over-density, compared to the critical density at that redshift. Over-
dense structures are gravitationally bound and will collapse. With the cosmology
know cosmological parameters, yields an overdensity of ‚àÜ= œÅH/œÅcrit ‚âà100 (Bryan
& Norman, 1998). But in this paradigm the Universe was thought to be matter-
dominated, the same calculation gave ‚àÜ= 18œÄ2 ‚âà177.7 and most researchers
continue to use this value of 200. Nevertheless, the idealized models being far
13

from the reality, it is really only an arbitrary choice, chosen simply to make it
easier to compare dierent and especially, older, studies.
Considering the sphere centered around the density peak of a halo and which,
on average, has a density ‚àÜtimes the critical one, its radius is then set and denoted
r‚àÜ. Its relation to the halo mass is simply:
MH = 4
3œÄ‚àÜr3
‚àÜœÅcrit
(1.4)
and conversely, if the mass had been given rst:
r‚àÜ=

3MH
4œÄ‚àÜœÅcrit
1/3
(1.5)
Using the denition of the critical density,
r‚àÜ=
 2GMH
œÄ‚àÜH(z)2
1/3
(1.6)
Note that if the Universe was matter-dominated, we would get
r‚àÜ‚àùM 1/3
H (1 + z)‚àí1
(1.7)
This means that, the halo mass being constant, the virial radius grows with time
(i.e. with decreasing redshift). This eect may sometimes produce the illusion of
growth (pseudo-growth), although the cosmic expansion is the sole responsible.
A typical order of magnitude for r‚àÜ=200 is 100 kpc.
Having dened a radius and assuming a spherically symmetric distribution, it
is possible to compute the speed at which a mass point would orbit precisely at
that radius. It is called the virial velocity (for it may be derived in the simplest
way from the virial theorem) and is dened by
vvir =
GMH
r‚àÜ
1/2

(1.8)
Note that if the Universe was matter-dominated, we would get
vvir ‚àùM 1/3
H (1 + z)1/2
(1.9)
A typical order of magnitude for vvir is 200 km.s‚àí1.
Setting arbitrarily ‚àÜ= 200, and calling r200 the virial radius, we can describe
any halo in a minimal way. Additionally, we may dene a typical time called the
dynamical time of the halo:

which is close to a free-fall time from the virial radius to the center of the halo,
if its mass was concentrated in its center, or alternatively an orbital time. It is
remarkable that this time does not depend on the halo mass, and in a matter-
dominated Universe, it would be simply proportional to (1 + z)‚àí3/2.
1.3
The importance of gas physics
Between gas and dark matter, a decoupling may occur at some stage of the conden-
sation process, due to (baryonic) gas physics emerging from microphysical inter-
actions (e.g., collisions) and the transitions between and losses of dierent energy
types (e.g., thermal, micro-kinetic, to electronic excitation through collisions lead-
ing to radiative cooling as the atoms recombine or change electronic states). The
gas may either resist gravitational forces due to its own internal pressure, or en-
dure a secondary condensation phase resulting from its cooling in pressurized
environment and self-gravitation.
15

1.3.1
Radiative cooling
The interaction between the particles of gas may convert its internal energy into
radiation. If the gas is largely transparent to this radiation, radiative losses repre-
sents a net cooling. The temperatures of interest in this work concern largely the
circum-galactic and intergalactic media, and thus range from 104 to 108 (but only
for the most extremely massive halos at low redshifts).
More precisely, for temperatures between 1 and 3 104 K, atoms of hydrogen get
ionized, while helium atoms are collisionally excited. When ions recombine with
an electron, they emit a photon. When atoms spontaneously decay (or de-excite),
they also emit a photon. Around 105 K, helium is ionized. At temperature higher
than 106 K, another phenomenon occurs: the plasma is almost fully ionized and the
electrical interactions make fast electrons to deviate from their linear trajectories.
This braking is, again associated with radiation: this is the bremsstrahlung, which
gets more intense with faster particles, so its intensity increases with increasing
temperature. Immediately below 104 K, a gas of composition close to the primeval
one displays a very inecient radiative cooling; this explains our temperature
oor that we will assume subsequently in our phenomenological modeling. It also
justies in many simulations why the cooling is truncated at 10,000 K.
Pristine gas being composed only of hydrogen and helium (with number density
ratio nHe/nH ‚âà1/12), Fig. 1.3 gives an example of the cooling power per unit of
number density of such a very low metallicity (10‚àí3 Z‚äô). These curves have been
computed under the assumption that the gas is at all times in a collisional ionized
equilibrium. Other higher metallicities are also represented and we can see the
strong impact of metals on the cooling rate.
Given such tabulated values for the cooling eciency Œõ(T, Z), it is possible to
evaluate the temperature loss:
dT
dt = ‚àí
nenHŒõ(T, Z)
(3/2 + s)(ne + nH)kB
(1.11)
with ne and nH the number densities of electrons and hydrogen respectively, s is
either 0 or 1 if the cooling is assumed to be isochoric or isobaric, respectively.
Although the eect of pressure may prevent the gas from following precisely the
gravitational eld generated by the dark matter distribution as the dark matter
grows into ever denser structures, the radiative cooling is often crucial for relieving
that pressure and allowing gravity and external work from a still hot environment
to compress the gas to an even larger extent than the dark matter would have
allowed on its own in the absence of radiative cooling.
16

1.3.2
Shock due to condensation
When do compression eects occur to gas as it is gravitationally driven by dark
matter? Let us reason with a theoretical, idealized formalism. When dark matter
converges toward a dense structure, DM particles cross the system, because matter
is transparent to them. After one crossing, and while the structure gains mass,
they turn around, thus describing an orbital curve around the barycentric locusa
plane for sheets, an axis for laments and a point for halos. Once a distribution
of mass is settled, with a density decreasing with the distance to that locus, newly
accreted shells (planar, cylindrical or spherical) will cross the distribution. The
surfaces of shell-crossing are called caustics and their mathematical study is still
ongoing (see for example Hidding et al., 2014). At this point, the accompanying
gas shells collide with the previously condensed ones.
The shell crossing of dark matter is hence a source of the decoupling between
dark and baryonic matter. The gaseous shell collision translates into an increase
in pressure, that propagates to further shells. As can be seen from the scalings
given above (Eqns. 1.2,1.9), densities are proportional to (1 + z)3 and speeds to
(1 + z)1/2, meaning that the higher the redshift, the stronger the collision. It is
then expected that a so-called accretion shock should occur in the external regions
of dense structures.
At high redshift, this ecient conversion of kinetic energy density (scaling like
(1+z)4) to thermodynamic and the associated entropy production must shape not
only the spatial discrepancy between dark and baryonic density gradients, but also
the history of the gas condensation. This motivated Birnboim & Dekel (2003) and
later Birnboim et al. (2016) in determining the stability of such shocks against the
pressure loss due to the ensuing radiative cooling.
1.3.3
From warm gas to stellar light
From halo growth to galaxy growth
The rst global theory for the formation of a dense, gaseous region at the center
of dark matter halos, presumably then into forming realistic galaxies, came with
Rees & Ostriker (1977); White & Rees (1978a); Fall & Efstathiou (1980a). They
stated that while matter settles in isotropically converging ows forming halos, gas
is prevented from condensing because of its collisional nature. The high pressure
supports it, its temperature increases as the halo grows in mass, scaling as if the
speed of sound was close to an orbital speed in the halo. More precisely, we call
this temperature the virial one and dene it as:
Tvir = ¬µmp
3kB
v2
vir
(1.12)
17

where ¬µmp is the average particle mass (mp being the mass of a proton), and kB
is the Boltzmann constant. Its typical values are around 3 105 ‚àí106 K.
The densest, innermost gas would then cool radiatively, up to a radius where
the cooling time (density-dependent, so radius-dependent, as soon as a density
prole is specied4) is equal to the dynamical time of the halo. This radius where
the two time scales are equal is called the cooling radius.
At the cooling radius, the gas loses its pressure, the central region further
collapses and the larger shells of gas lack the necessary pressure support, collapsing
as well, until a new pressure equilibrium is reached. This may never happen for
very low-mass halos since neither the virial temperature is high nor the equilibrium
can be reach quickly, leading to a rapid gas condensation. On the other hand, high-
mass halos (say, MH > 5 1011 M‚äô) exhibit a virial velocity higher than the speed
of sound in the incoming gas (T0 ‚âà104 K), thus possibly producing a spherical
shock. The post-shock gas may then keep its pressure support for more than one
dynamical time, and the rate of gas condensing in the center of the potential is
strongly decreased.
During its cooling and compression, the gas, in this model, conserves its angular
momentum which leads to a faster rotation. This has been one explanation for the
formation of planar dense gaseous regions, precursor of (spiral) galaxies. We only
talked about the migration and the condensation of accreted gas through the halo,
but what happens next? The central, oblate region reaches high densities and
undergoes further gravitational instabilities that fragments it into much smaller
but much denser disks and eventually forming stars. Populated with stars in a
gaseous bath, the central regions of halos are now galaxies, within the context of
this simple cooling picture.
Gaseous lamentary accretion onto galaxies
Since the works of Birnboim & Dekel (2003); Kere¬≤ et al. (2005); Dekel & Birn-
boim (2006); Dekel et al. (2009), a new paradigm has emerged. Kere¬≤ et al. (2005)
showed that a substantial fraction of the mass of gas accreted by a galaxy came
from thin, dense, almost unidimensional channels, with the peculiarity of being
warm (‚àº104 K) even when the halo gas was much hotter. This lamentary accre-
tion was found to be dominant over other modes, even mergers, above a redshift of
about 1. While Birnboim & Dekel (2003) had provided a new explanation for the
change of regime in smooth accretion, by reducing the virial shock stability to
a simpler criterion based on an eective adibatic index, Dekel & Birnboim (2006)
extended this study to the lamentary accretion. The involved densities being
separated by orders of magnitude, the stability criterion was met so that even in
4The simplest case is that of an isothermal sphere at pressure equilibrium. An alternative
would make use of an NFW density prole.

Figure 1.4: An important and inuential gure from Dekel & Birnboim (2006).
Below ‚àº5 1011 M‚äô, the smooth accretion cools faster than it is compressed and
stimulates galactic star formation; above that limit, a stable shock prevents any
ecient cooling. The cold-in-hot zone represents the masses and redshifts for
which laments are most likely to undergo no stable shock, thus feeding the galaxy
with warm gas. Dashed lines show the Press-Schechter 1- and 2-œÉ typical halo
masses as functions of the redshift, to guide the eye through the process of halo
growth.
However, such a picture leads to galaxies drowning in baryons.
To
alleviate this, models then require very ecient outows to moderate the gas
content of galaxies and to keep their growth inecient. We concern ourselves in
this thesis with this supply of gas. Can micro-physical processes prevent or at least
lengthen the time it takes for gas to accrete onto galaxies? Lowering the accretion
eciency alleviates a number of signicant astrophysical challenges as we discuss
in Chapter 2.

lution studies. Galaxies are simply not following the development of dark matter
and its distribution in halos. Various processes must have made galaxy formation
inecient. As can be seen in this gure, the authors concern themselves with
the loss term, outows, where active galactic nuclei eject mass from the high mass
halos, while supernovae (SN) remove the gas from low mass halos. In this thesis,
we concern ourselves with the supply side, how does the gas form into structures
and accrete into individual dark matter halos.
the case when the spherical accretion is shocked, laments may endure no such
shock and penetrate the halo, feeding the galaxy with fresh fuel to support the
growth of the stellar populations within galaxies. As seen in Fig. 1.4, this cold
mode accretion was found to occur at redshifts higher than 2 and for halo masses
lower than a value which increases with redshift.
The work presented here is precisely an attempt to better understand the
nature and the dynamics of this accretion mode. The next section explains why it
is important to investigate this mode of accretion in more detail.

1.4
Challenges of galaxy evolution
Several pieces of observational information are intriguing. First of all, the overall
average star formation rate (SFR) reaches a clear maximum up to a redshift of
about 1.5 and then abruptly declines (e.g. Madau et al., 1996; Madau & Dickin-
son, 2014). Why would galaxies form more and more stars and then decline so
precipitously? Moreover, as highlighted by Fig. 1.5, if one na√Øvely states that the
stellar mass of galaxies should be proportional to their host halo mass, Œõ-CDM
would provide strong overestimates for low-mass and high-mass galaxies. So, what
prevented low-mass and high-mass halos to grow a galaxy with a stellar component
consistent with that of average L‚ãÜgalaxies? This apparent lack of stars is con-
nected to the broader question of the so-called missing baryon problem (less than
50% of the expected baryons are observed), the other side of the same coin being
the over-cooling problem (numerical simulations tend to heavily overestimate the
gas condensation by cooling). Why is galaxy formation so inecient? Two families
of explanations were provided, and neither totally excludes the other.
1.4.1
Extrinsic explanations for inecient galaxy formation
The rst explanation may come by investigating processes for limiting the accretion
of gas. As we said before, if a stable shock propagates outwards in the halo gas,
baryons may remain at constant radius, supported by the hydrostatic pressure of
the halo gas, for a time larger than one dynamical time, if for example, the circum-
galactic medium is very dilute. This may be the case for the highest scale structures
like inter-cluster laments or cluster halos. Hard X-ray emission is the signature of
hot gas with a long cooling time. Within this context, missing baryons would lie
in multi-phase gas retained in the halo as warm-hot intergalactic gas. It's emission
would be extremely weak due to its rarity (low density).
Then, a new question arises: if strong mass inows of warm gas is allowed via a
cold-mode accretion at high redshift, would not this mode stimulate the forma-
tion of baryon-rich, luminous galaxies? Without ruining the judicious reasoning
that accounted for early massive galaxies, we need to investigate the precise fate
of intergalactic laments close to the point where their role in supplying galaxies
with gas shifts from leading to negligible. There may well be mechanisms to reduce
their galaxy-feeding eciency earlier, at higher redshifts and in lower mass halos,
than currently expected from theory.
1.4.2
Intrinsic explanations for inecient galaxy formation
The second possible type of explanation as to why galaxy formation is so inecient
is illustrated in Fig. 1.5. These intrinsic explanations involve processes that are a
21

result of the formation history of the galaxy itself. A galaxy is basically composed
gaseous and a stellar components, and it exchanges mass and energy with its im-
mediate environment, the circum-galactic medium, possibly the local inter-galactic
medium. Internal evolution, correlated with mass growth and the evolution of its
stellar populations or the growth of a supermassive black hole through gas accre-
tion, could lie at the heart of galaxies evolving from a rapid accretion and vigorous
outows mode of growth and evolution to a more quiescent growth of gas and stars
with only limited outow rates.
On the low-mass end (‚àº108 M‚äô) of the galaxy and dark matter mass dis-
tribution, the gravitational well of the dark matter halo is neither sucient to
overcome the gas pressure up to a point where the cooling becomes ecient, nor,
on the other hand, can it retain the gas expelled due to the combined energy out-
put supernovae (if such energy is eectively thermalized). On the high-mass end
(‚àº1013 M‚äô), mass accretion is accompanied by growth of a central (super)massive
black hole. The more massive it gets, the more energy it extracts from the gas at
constant accretion rate, which increases its bolometric luminosity and mechanical
energy output in the form of intense radiation and powerful outows. This ejec-
tion, even if it is collimated and as long as it couples eectively to the ambient gas,
disrupts and heats the interstellar medium. Since internal processes give rise to
the shutdown of star formation, nominally by removing the gas, but also perhaps
through the strong generation of turbulence, such processes are collectively called
negative feedback.
1.4.3
Accretionfeedback interaction?
Feedback processes generally involve energy, mass, and momentum ejection from
the galaxy. The thermal, turbulent, and kinetic energies, as well as the momentum
must be deposited in the surrounding medium, that is the circum-galactic medium
(CGM), possibly in to the IGM well beyond the virial radius. But these are also
the very regions crossed by accreting material, themselves carriers of energy and
momentum.
We expect the two families of ows to interact in some extent5 . The result
of such an interaction is dicult to predict: there exist many sets of conditions,
allowing or preventing from condensing again and raining on the galaxy (see
e.g. Voit et al., 2015b). In other words, the interaction between accreting and
outowing gas could turn into either a positive or negative feedback loop. In fact,
in reality, it is probably both. That's not the real question. The really poignant
5The eciency of such an interaction depends on several factors, fro example the geometry
of the ows: if an AGN produces a jet perpendicular to the galactic plane while a warm lament
reaches the ISM parallel to that plane, they would not directly interact.
22

question is does feedback increase or decrease the gas accretion ecient overall.
With the current state of the art simulations, it appears that this interaction
moderates the inow rates but it is not exactly clear how. In this context, it is
essential to study the stability of the accreting IGFs, as a possible disruption would
not only alter the accretion eciency, but also the way they interact with galactic
feedback outows.

Chapter 2
Modeling the entry in the halo
Abstract
Simulations of cosmological lamentary accretion reveal ows (streams) of warm
gas, T‚àº104K, which are ecient in bringing gas into galaxies.
We present a
phenomenological scenario where gas in such ows  if it is shocked as it enters the
halo as we assume  become biphasic and, as a result, turbulent. We consider a
collimated stream of warm gas that ows into a halo from an over dense lament
of the cosmic web. The post-shock streaming gas adjusts its pressure with the
ambient halo gas, and fragments as it cools. The fragmented stream forms a two
phase medium: a warm cloudy phase embedded in hot post-shock gas. We argue
that the hot phase sustains the accretion shock. During fragmentation, a fraction
of the initial kinetic energy of the infalling gas is converted into turbulence among
and within the warm clouds. The thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas
is largely determined by the relative, competing timescales of several processes:
the cooling, the expansion of the post-shock gas, the amount of turbulence in
the clouds, and the dynamical time of the halo. We expect the gas to become
multiphase when the gas cooling and dynamical times are of the same order-of-
magnitude. In this framework, we show that this occurs in the important mass
range of Mhalo‚àº1011 ‚àí1013 M‚äô, where the bulk of stars have formed in galaxies.
Due to expansion and turbulence, gas accreting along cosmic web laments may
eventually loose coherence and mix with the ambient halo gas. Through both the
phase separation and disruption of the stream, the accretion eciency onto a
galaxy in a halo dynamical time is lowered. De-collimating ows make the direct
interaction between galaxy feedback and accretion streams more likely, thereby
further reducing the overall accretion eciency. As we discuss, moderating the
gas accretion eciency through these mechanisms may help to alleviate a number
of signicant challenges in theoretical galaxy formation.

2.1
Motivations
The physical state of the gas accreting onto a galactic halo is thought to largely de-
termine the star formation history of the galaxy itself. When most of the accreting
matter is still coming from intergalactic laments (IGFs), studying theoretically
the physical conditions of the gas they carry into the halo is therefore of prime im-
portance in understanding how galaxies grow and evolve. Two families of scenarii
have been envisioned theoretically. The rst one, the gas is warm1, ‚àº104 K, as
falls into the potential of the halo ultimately feeding the galaxy with fresh gas and
supporting its star formation. In the other scenario the gas is hot, ‚â≥5 105 K, and
due to mixing generally leads to feeding the halo with hot gas. Unless the cooling
time of the gas penetrating the halo is short relative to the dynamical time of the
halo, it will simply feed the halo with gas, generally not the galaxy itself except
perhaps over a very long timescale.
The lamentary accretion obviously shares common features with the spher-
ical2 accretion because the gas it involves is considered of the same general na-
ture, but with a higher density and an expected lower temperature, and because
its dynamics is also strongly driven by the potential well of the dark matter halo.
Nevertheless, the geometry of a lament, as opposed to spherical diuse accretion,
has a stronger inuence on how the galaxy evolves. First, due to its collimated
nature as its travel through the halo, its cross section is small enough that it may
not encounter outows from the galaxy. The cross section of a stream is roughly
two orders of magnitude less than the surface of a sphere encompassing the galaxy
itself. More particularly, by conservation of angular momentum, infall trajectory
of streams tends to align with the galactic plane, avoiding then possible powerful
outows from an AGN or intense star formation occurring within the halo's cen-
tral galaxy. Secondly, its possibly high overdensity compared to most of the halo
gas provides it with enough inertia to penetrate deeply into the circum-galactic
medium (CGM) of the galaxy. Because of their possible high eciency in reaching
the galaxy proper, IGFs are expected to be major drivers of the gas supply within
galaxies and hence support their star formation, when suitable conditions are met.
As with spherical accretion, the two scenarios rely on the existence of a shock
propagating upwards into the cooler core of an IGF. When it exists, its stability,
1This situation is often refered to as cold mode accretion. However, we will use the term
warm, since this is the common nomenclature in studies of the interstellar medium for ionized
and neutral gas at a few 1000 to 104 K such as the warm ionized or the warm neutral medium
(WIM/WNM). The term cold is reserved for gas below these temperatures  the cold neutral
and the cold molecular media.
2Spherical, or isotropic accretion are named this way because of idealized spherical halos.
It is of course rather unrealistic, as dark matter halos are expected to be ellipsoidal and irregular.
Some authors use the word smooth to refer to this kind of accretion.
27

its strength and the propensity to cool all determine whether the mode of accretion
is hot or warm. If it is unstable, as predicted by Dekel & Birnboim (2006) at low
redshifts (z ‚â≤2 ‚àí3) and for high halo masses, the shock collapses down and no
heating occurs. Its stability may be inferred from the radiative nature of the shock,
as well as the compression due to the converging owlines and the pressure increase
in the halo when falling in. If it is not strong enough (Mach numer M ‚â≤5), the
gas is heated up to only ‚àº105 K and the density is increased by a factor > 3.5. In
such a case, the radiative cooling is ecient on a timescale shorter than the infall
timescale (here the relevant dynamical time) and the stream ends up warm.
2.2
Rationale
Numerical simulations may be of great help to understand the fate of the gas
driven along laments, especially their dynamics. Chapter 3 shows that a great
deal of information about the physical conditions are revealed in zoom-in simula-
tion. However, there are limitations that are inherent to numerical computations,
such as the nite resolution or the nite number of processes modeled. A number
of phenomena that stem from excluded (or of which scale is unreachable) micro-
physical processes, such as many hydro- and thermodynamic instabilities, may not
develop in simulations of relatively low resolution. In particular, the turbulence
because of the extended range of scales needed to cover the turbulent cascade(s),
and the thermal fragmentationbecause of the small-scale uctuations needed to
seed the rst fragments would not be computed. For example, observations of
the ISM in the MW suggest that turbulence is dissipated on scales well below a
pc (e.g., Miville-Desch√™nes et al. 2017).
We already noted the importance of the weak interactions between the halo
gas and the galactic outows on the one hand, and the IGF material on the other
hand, when accreting in warm mode. Allowing for the possibility to have both
hot and warm gas leads to the possibly increased eciency of such interactions.
As far as this model allows it, we will then address at least the question of the
eective cross-section of the lament when it penetrates into the virial sphere.
The redshift 2 will be the one we exemplify in specic illustrative calculations,
but the model does not restrict to that value. There are two reasons for this. First,
this is the epoch when, statistically, the co-moving density of star formation of the
ensemble of galaxies is at a turning point. The star-formation rate (SFR) density
evolution bends from increasing to decreasing around z ‚âà2.
The prediction
from Dekel & Birnboim (2006) that warm laments would stop feeding galaxies
eciently in massive halos matches this value. Thus, learning more about the
gas physics of lamentary accretion will help rening models that explain this
evolution in the star-formation rate density with cosmic time.
28

Secondly, the redshift at which the dominant contribution to the growth of
galactic halos shifts from the lamentary accretion to the halo mergers is estimated
to be around z ‚àº1.5. Below this redshift, the study of IGF accretion may be
somewhat less relevant within the context of galaxy growth, even if it would still
be interesting to understand peculiarities of halo gas and CGM close to galaxies
at all redshifts.
But as said, our model is more general and is aimed at determining the con-
ditions under which a lamentary ow becomes turbulent and multiphase, and in
what amount.
2.3
The beginnings of a phenomenological model
for a turbulent and multiphase post-shock medium
In this section, we discuss our initial analysis of the formation of bi-phasic turbulent
post-shock medium of the streams. We discuss the initial conditions of the stream
and halo gas the stream is owing into. In this early analysis, our basic assumption
was that the post-shock gas was in thermodynamic equilibrium.
Thus, if the
post-shock gas met the criterion for becoming thermally unstable (Field, 1965),
then it would become bi-phasic. Turbulence would also be generated from the
transformation of the bulk kinetic energy into random motions of the warm clouds
and in turbulence within the clouds. However, subsequently, we realized that the
assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium was not necessary, and perhaps even
dicult to justify within the context of a phenomenological model. We developed a
more general case where the stream develops inhomogeneities due to, for example,
the shock being oblique, having a range of velocities due to shock curvature, and/or
having an initially inhomogeneous stream (where the inhomogeneities are amplied
in the post-shock gas). This section captures the development of our initial ideas
and initial conditions and assumptions for a more fully developed model of gas
accretion into galaxy halos.
2.3.1
Overview
The phenomenological and somewhat idealized models all considered an initially
cylindrical ow of conned, warm gas and the possible shock was stationary, with
a priori laminar, homogeneous post-shock ow, surrounded by a medium at hy-
drostatic equilibrium. We considered the case where:
‚Ä¢ there is a stable, stationary shock;
‚Ä¢ the IGM is at very low metallicity (Z < 10‚àí3Z‚äô);
29

‚Ä¢ turbulence is produced3 by the shock;
‚Ä¢ the post-shock medium, being in thermodynamic equilibrium, heterogeneously
cools to develop a multiphase medium leading to two phases: the warm one
and the hot one;
‚Ä¢ the relative motion of warm clouds has captured all of the turbulent motions.
2.3.2
Fixed parameters
Our model applies to any given halo mass MH at any given redshift z. Thus, the
critical density of the Universe œÅcrit, the virial radius rvir and the virial velocity vvir
are considered known. A oor temperature is xed at T0 = 104 K, below which the
gas can not cool. This is a consequence of the abrupt fall of the cooling eciency
at low metallicities. The initial temperature of the lament, dened as `warm', is
set to T0.
2.3.3
Free parameters
A few parameters are kept free. The over-density of the lament compared to the
surrounding IGM is denoted f and is considered free because simulations show
that it may widely vary from one lament to another, and from one halo to an-
other. The nal volume-averaged turbulent pressure over the initial ram pressure
is labelled Œ∑ and is free because it is extremely dicult to reliably quantify the
energy conversion to random turbulent motions. We would indeed need, rst, a
robust model for shock instabilities, and for compressive, non-isothermal, turbu-
lence in radiating medium. Even with those, we would need to expand the number
of assumptions and postulate realistic values for supplemental parameters. The
volume lling factors of the warm and hot components are œÜv,w and œÜv,h = 1‚àíœÜv,w.
The use of œÜv,w as an input parameter is complementary to the use of œÜm,w, the
mass fraction of the gas falling into warm temperatures. It is a free parameter
because only few may be known about the phase separation without the knowl-
edge of power-spectra of thermodynamic quantities and other information related
to microphysics. This, again, prevents us from making the model too intricate
and too dubious due to an oversized set of assumptions. We note that ultimately,
some of these parameters are not truly free but that microphysics within the gas
must regulate the amount of energy, for example, it transformed into cloud-cloud
motions.
3We can either consider that turbulence is produced or that the turbulent velocity dispersion
in the pre-shock medium was negligible compared to the total pressure but strongly amplied
by the shock.
30

2.3.4
Foundational denitions
Denition 1  The properties of the halo gas useful to our scenario are its density
at the virial radius, œÅH, its temperature, TH, and the law for ideal gases let us also
directly derive its pressure PH. The density of IGM/halo gas close to the virial
radius, is the fundamental density of the model: œÅ0 = œÅH.
Denition 2  The lament is cylindrical (perfectly collimated), homogeneous,
its initial density is:
œÅ1 = fœÅ0
(2.1)
Denition 3  Its initial pressure is then:
p1 = (kB/¬µmp) œÅ1T0
(2.2)
Denition 4  The density of the warm and hot components are respectively
designated as œÅw and œÅh.
Denition 5  The volume-averaged densities of the warm and hot components,
of the overall medium are:
f
œÅw = œÜv,wœÅw, eœÅh = œÜv,hœÅh
(2.3)
which allows us to dene the overall average density as:
œÅ2 = f
œÅw + eœÅh
(2.4)
Denition 6  The mass fractions of each component are easily dened:
œÜm,w = f
œÅw/œÅ2, œÜm,h = eœÅh/œÅ2
(2.5)
Denition 7  The initial speed of sound in the lament is (squared):
c2
s = Œ≥ (kB/¬µmp) T0
(2.6)
so that the initial Mach number is:
M1 = v1/cs
(2.7)
Denition 8  The nal post-expansion or contraction cross section of the ow
is increased by a factor S. Note that it may take any real, positive value, meaning
that S < 1 implies an actual contraction.
31

2.3.5
Hypotheses and their formal expressions
To allow for a suciently simple modelling, we posited a number of hypotheses
that were plausible from what was known about cold streams, virial shocks, and
gas physics in this kind of environment. We here present them, with their formal
translations into mathematics, using the previous denitions.
Hypothesis 1  The lament comes in at the virial velocity:
v1 = vvir
(2.8)
This is equivalent to the case where gas is falling from innity toward an isolated
halo. It is compatible with the ndings of Goerdt & Ceverino (2015a).
Hypothesis 2  The whole system (including the shock) is stationary.
The Rankine-Hugoniot jump relations apply easily to a stationary shock and
that is why it is often easier to choose the reference frame of the discontinuity
front. Would the shock propagate in the frame of the halo? Birnboim & Dekel
(2003) numerically found that an accretion spherical shock would settle close to
the virial radius along the cosmic expansion and the halo growth. Our intuition
that the possible existence of a shock in the penetrating lament would occur at
the virial radius and thus correspond to a virial shock led us to postulate that this
shock would also be stationary. Assuming its existence also means that we assume
that the conditions for its stability are met, implying that its post-shock medium
would support it, even if dissipative processes occur afterward. To ensure this, the
simplest hypothesis consists in the stationarity of the whole system.
Hypothesis 3  Halo is in hydrostatic equilibrium with an NFW prole. Halo is
set to be at the virial temperature:
TH = Tvir = Œ≥ ‚àí1
2
(¬µmp/ kB)v2
vir
(2.9)
The isothermal sphere is a common assumption that ts to observations of
cluster halos. Our goal being to model cases where the halos are massive, this is
acceptable. The hydrostatic equilibrium is an idealized situation, as it is specif-
ically applicable to isotropic and homogeneous gaseous halos.
Using the virial
temperature also means that the halo gas has itself been shocked, or at least com-
pressed, without being able to radiate away its heat.
The density in the halo follows an NFW prole:
œÅ0 = fbœÅnfw (rvir) ‚âà37.0 √ó fbœÅcrit
(2.10)
The prole derived in Navarro et al. (1997) is known to t the observed density
proles of halos. It is then appropriate to estimate the values of our initial condi-
tions. However, the NFW prole applies to dark matter. By multiplying it with
32

the cosmic baryonic fraction, we simply express the fact that before the entry in
the halo, gas and dark matter are still coupled. This of course is an extreme as-
sumption, but recent observational results seem to suggest that perhaps the CGM
of galaxies has a signicant reservoir of gas (e.g., Werk et al. 2014).
The pressure close to the virial radius is then:
pH = (kB/¬µmp) œÅ0TH = Œ≥ ‚àí1
2
œÅ0v2
vir
(2.11)
This directly results from the two previous choices.
As we may see later,
this assumption is of great importance, as it sets the thermodynamic boundary
condition of the ow.
Hypothesis 4  The system is impermeable, i.e. mass is conserved along the ow:
SœÅ2v2 = œÅ1v1
(2.12)
and there is no (immediate) mixing with the surrounding gas and such mixing
only takes place when the hot stream gas has expanded and reached pressure
equilibrium with the ambient halo gas.
If the gas originally coming from the IGF mixed at some point with the halo
gas, the imaginary boundary of our system would be permeable and we could not
rely anymore on the mass conservation relation. The mixing may occur wherever
the surface separating the two uids is the site of a sheared ow. Giving rise to
hydrodynamical instabilities such as that of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KHI), the growth
rate thereof is to be evaluated. It appears to be, for the choices of densities we
will make, of the order of the transverse sound-crossing time, which is in some
cases shorter than other times typical of the evolution of our system. However,
the rate may only be evaluated at the onset of the instability, where it is maximal,
decreasing when entering the nonlinear regime. If the KHI develops, the resulting
mixing layer would be restricted in width at its saturation and it would still be
correct to apply then our model to a narrower system that does not undergo any
rapid mixing.
Hypothesis 5  The ow system entirely reaches pressure equilibrium with the
halo:
œÅwTw = œÅhTh = œÅHTH
(2.13)
This assumption will be tested. The propagation of rarefaction waves from the
interface with the halo gas to the innermost region of our ow should occur in a
few times the transverse sound-crossing time. Computing this time and comparing
it to other dynamical times has proved fundamental to our approach, as will be
discussed subsequently.
33

Hypothesis 6  The system is adiabatically bounded (no heat exchange) and
there is no momentum exchange, momentum is conserved:
S
 œÅ2v2
2 + Œ∑œÅ1v2
1 + pH


1 + p1
(2.14)
which, in virtue of Hypothesis 3, can be written as:
SœÅ2v2
2 =

œÅ1v2
1 + p1
(2.15)
For a monatomic gas, the Prandtl number is Pr = 2/3. It relates the viscous
term to the heat diusion term of the energetic equation, so that if viscosity is
neglected at the interface with the halo gas, thermal diusion would also be. Like
for the KHI, this layer may be omitted if needed, but viscous eects are very likely
to be weak on the scales considered in our model: the Reynolds number is lower
than a few hundreds, still close to a laminar regime.
Hypothesis 7  The warm component has radiated away its heat and ends at the
oor temperature:
Tw = T0
(2.16)
The oor temperature is set by the cooling eciency of a metal-poor gas,
which is very low below 104 K and also by possible heating sources of gas at this
temperature such as the meta-galactic ux. The ability for the gas to cool down to
that temperature is measured by the cooling time, dened later. Like the sound-
crossing time, it is essential to compare its value relative to other times in order
for our model to be valid.
Hypothesis 8  The ow rst endures a normal shock and the Rankine-Hugoniot
equations apply at this stage:

1p1
(2.17)
where the subscript ps stands for 'post-shock', and the rightmost members of each
line correspond to the asymptotic case of a Mach number much greater than 1.
In fact, this is the strongest assumption we make. The post-shock conditions
are indeed derived from it, and hence all the subsequent calculations. The existence
of a shock inside the lament is debated. Numerical simulations may have found
that it propagates up to a few virial radii but can not accurately resolve the
discontinuity. Analytical arguments are not easy to develop either. In the next
chapter we will hypothesize about possible ways of forming such a shock. The
34

planarity and the orthogonality to the ow are chosen for the sake of simplicity.
Nevertheless, oblique shocks would not result in very dierent numbers and curved
shocks imply many more parameters to be correctly dened. But ultimately, we
will argue that oblique and curved shocks may be central to understanding how
post-shock gas may fragment.
Hypothesis 9  If the phase separation occurred after having expanded, both
component have the same bulk motion:
vw = vh = v2
(2.18)
and if the phase separation occurred before the expansion, then:
vw = vps, vh = v2
(2.19)
In other terms, the mass of gas that will end up being warm must keep the
velocity it has when the cooling begins, since both its mass and its momentum
are constant, provided that warm clouds y freely into the hot component. In
one asymptotic case, the warm component forms rapidly just after the shock, it
keeps the post-shock velocity. In the other asymptotic case, it starts cooling after
the pressure has adjusted to the halo and thus after the bulk velocity has evolved
accordingly to the cross-section of the ow. This relation is needed to close the
system of equations. But it depends on the ratio of the cooling to the sound-
crossing time. As we will see, even if the intermediate situation is the most likely
one, the two extreme cases (a ratio much greater or much lower than one) are of
great help in understanding the evolution of the ow.
Hypothesis 10  The hot component has only adiabatically and reversibly, i.e.,
no heat transfer and no entropy increase, expanded since the post-shock stage:
œÅŒ≥
hpps = œÅŒ≥
pspH
(2.20)
which is strictly equivalent to:
œÅŒ≥‚àí1
h
Tps = œÅŒ≥‚àí1
ps Th
(2.21)
This directly derives from Hypothesis 6 and from the assumption that the loss
of pressure due to the cooling of a fraction of the gas will not signicantly aect
the remaining hot fraction.
Hypothesis 11  Turbulence is only carried by the warm phase in the form of
relative random motions:
Œ∑œÅ1v2
1 = f
œÅwœÉ2 = xwœÅwœÉ2 = ywœÅ2œÉ2
(2.22)
where œÉ is the velocity dispersion associated with turbulence, more precisely the
nal warm cloud velocity dispersion. Written this way, this term has the dimension
35

of a pressure and precisely corresponds to the Reynolds-averaged stress tensor,
when inserted into the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation (RANS).
2.4
From our initial phenomenological analysis to
a more general model
The model that we have just outlined, with its set of hypotheses, enabled us to
successfully derive various relations that are useful for a more general and perhaps
more appropriate model for streams passing through an accretion shock.
The
fact that several quantities are free parameters also allowed us to explore a wide
range of parameter space. Some surfaces in the (f, Œ∑, œÜv,w) space bound with the
subspace where the solutions to the equations exist. This is also one of the reasons
why we performed a numerical experiment as described in the next chapter, as a
means to constrain parameters and to better understand the initial conditions for
the stream before it penetrates the halo.
After a year and a half of exploration, we developed a more complete phe-
nomenological model for streams penetrating halos.
The development just de-
scribed in the previous section was useful for setting the stage for the evolution
of the post-shock streaming gas. Now however, to understand the impact of al-
lowing for expansion and fragmentation of the post-shock accreting gas within
the context of galaxy evolution, we have to consider various timescales that are
relevant for galaxies. The salient time scales that necessary to understand the
evolution of the the post-shock gas are: the time necessary for the gas to cool 
the post-shock cooling time scale; the hot post-shock gas will expand into the am-
bient halo gas. We estimate this expansion timescale as a relative rate of change
in the pressure, assuming the expansion is adiabatic. The leads to the concept of
the post-expansion cooling time; to understand how the stream may evolve, we
compare these timescales with the dynamical time of the halo. There are other
relevant timescales of course, as we describe, but it is the relationships between
these characteristic timescales, that are essential for establishing the regimes in
which the post-shock gas might become bi-phasic and turbulent. Doing a parame-
ter space search phenomenologically by comparing various timescales for dierent
post-shock temperature (halo masses) and stream over-densities, always us to in-
vestigate which regimes where the gas will not develop a bi-phasic structure. For
example, in what regime the post-shock gas will remain hot or cool quickly re-
forming a warm stream of gas. To make such an analysis, we rely now on the
assumption that through a variety of mechanisms, like obliqueness of the shock
or inhomogeneities in the accreting stream, the post-shock gas is inhomogeneous.
With these more general developments and timescale comparisons, we can now
36

investigate: When and how do post-shock gas in streams become multi-phased
and turbulent?
2.5
Are cosmological gas accretion streams multi-
phase and turbulent?
We here reproduce in extenso the article submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics
and whose initial version had been published on ArXiv as Cornuault et al. (2016).
We added two subsections developping and extending the model for a time-evolving
distribution which we used in the paper.
2.5.1
Introduction
The realization that we live in a dark matter dominated universe led to the de-
velopment of the rst comprehensive theory of galaxy formation (e.g. White &
Rees, 1978b; Fall & Efstathiou, 1980b). These analytic models embedded simple
gas physics into the hierarchical growth of structure whereby smaller halos merged
over time forming successively more massive halos (White & Rees, 1978b). Despite
the successes of this model in understanding the scale of observed galaxy masses,
it was soon realized that there were a number of problems. The most signicant
is that modeled galaxies form with a higher fraction of baryons than is observed
(e.g., Ferrara et al., 2005; Bouch√© et al., 2006; Anderson & Bregman, 2010; Werk
et al., 2014). This failure was dubbed the over-cooling problem (Benson et al.,
2003).
As numerical simulations allowed for galaxy growth to be coupled to the de-
velopment of large scale structure, they showed that much of the accreting mass
may penetrate into the halo as laments of gas and dark matter (Kere¬≤ et al.,
2005; Ocvirk et al., 2008a). Whether or not these streams pass through a stable
accretion shock as they penetrate the halo depends on the mass and redshift of
the halo (Birnboim & Dekel, 2003; Dekel & Birnboim, 2006, hereafter BD03 and
DB06 respectively). If the shock is not stable, the accretion ow is cold. This
cold mode accretion in simulations occurs as streams of warm (104 K) gas enter-
ing the halo, smooth at kpc-scale and weakly coupled to the infalling dark matter
laments (Danovich et al., 2015; Wetzel & Nagai, 2015). Cold mode accretion is
ecient in reaching down to a few tenths of a virial radius (Dekel & Birnboim,
2006; Behroozi et al., 2013). The high eciency of gas accretion in some simula-
tions leads to model galaxies with unrealistically high baryon fractions emphasizing
the over-cooling problem. To alleviate the problem of excess baryons in simulated
galaxies, ecient outows and feedback were introduced (e.g., Hopkins et al., 2012,
37

2016). Feedback both heats the gas in the halo, preventing it from cooling, and
also ejects gas from both the galaxy and halo lowering their total gas content.
The circum-galactic media of galaxies are certainly not devoid of gas, perhaps
containing up to approximately half of the total baryon content of the halo (e.g.,
Werk et al., 2014; Peek et al., 2015). This gas is known empirically to be mul-
tiphase. The multiphase nature of halo gas is most evident in local high mass
halos, those with masses on the scales of cluster or groups. In clusters, for ex-
ample, even at constant pressure, a very wide range of gas phases are observed,
from hot X-ray emitting gas to cold, dense molecular gas (e.g., Jae et al., 2005;
Edge et al., 2010; Salom√© et al., 2011; Tremblay et al., 2012; Hamer et al., 2016;
Emonts et al., 2016). In galaxy halos, the detection of multiphase gas is mostly
through the absorption lines from warm neutral and ionized gas (‚â≤104 to ‚àº106
K) and dust via the reddening of background galaxies and quasars (M√©nard et al.,
2010; Peek et al., 2015, but see Pinto et al. 2014 for the detection of hot gas in
X-ray emission lines). Outows from galaxies are also multiphase (e.g., Beir√£o
et al., 2015; Heckman & Thompson, 2017) and are likely crucial for creating and
maintaining the multiphase gas in halos (e.g., Gaspari et al., 2012; Sharma et al.,
2012a; Borthakur et al., 2013; Voit et al., 2015b; Hayes et al., 2016).
There is only circumstantial evidence for smooth, collimated accretion streams
penetrating into galaxy halos (e.g., Martin et al., 2015; Bouch√© et al., 2016; Ver-
net et al., 2017a,
and references therein).
In analogy with analyses of gas in
halos and outows, a phenomenological approach may provide additional insights
into the nature of ows and halos that galaxy simulations are perhaps not yet
achieving (e.g., Sharma et al., 2010, 2012a,b; Singh & Sharma, 2015; Voit et al.,
2015b,a; Thompson et al., 2016). The notion that over-cooling remains a problem
in simulations, that there is scant observational evidence for the streams of the
type currently simulated, and because high speed collisions of gas can lead to mul-
tiphase turbulent media (Guillard et al., 2009, 2010; Ogle et al., 2010; Peterson
et al., 2012; Appleton et al., 2013; Alatalo et al., 2015), all motivated us to analyze
gas accretion ows phenomenologically.
Just as with the explanation for the lack of cooling ows in clusters (e.g.,
Peterson et al., 2003; Raerty et al., 2008), our current understanding of accre-
tion ows in galaxy halos may also suer from an overly simplistic view of gas
thermodynamics. In clusters, it is now understood that heating and cooling are
in approximate global balance, preventing the gas from cooling catastrophically
(e.g., Raerty et al., 2008; Sharma et al., 2012a,b; McCourt et al., 2012; Zhuravleva
et al., 2014; Voit et al., 2015a). In analogy with gas in cool core clusters, and in
contrast to what a number of cosmological simulations currently show, the gas in
streams may not cool globally. Instead, if the gas in streams is inhomogeneous and
subject to thermal and hydrodynamic instabilities (e.g., Sharma et al., 2010), the
38

dierences in cooling times between the gas phases will lead to fragmentation of
the gas. If streams are unstable, their gas will not remain monophasic or laminar.
Thus, our goal in this paper is to investigate the question posed in the title: Are
Cosmological Gas Accretion Streams Multiphase and Turbulent?. If yes, the gas
energetics may regulate the gas accretion eciency. Dekel et al. (2013) estimated
the penetration eciency over large halo scales at z‚àº2 of ‚àº50% but this estimate
only considered macroscopic processes that may inuence the accretion eciency.
Because heating and cooling are controlled by the mass, energy and momentum
exchanges between the gas phases, a careful investigation of the gas physics on
microscopic scales is required to investigate whether those microphysical processes
may further reduce the eciency of gas accretion onto galaxies.
To investigate the question posed in the title, we begin by presenting a qual-
itative sketch of our scenario, make a quantitative investigation of the impact of
expansion in the post-shock gas on an accretion ow, and then discuss the case
where the post-shock gas has small uctuations in density and temperature, de-
veloping a criterion for when the gas will fragment (¬ü 2.5.2). In ¬ü 2.5.3, we discuss
the consequences of the formation of a multiphase ow on the thermodynamic
evolution of the stream after it penetrates the halo. To gauge the astrophysical
pertinence of our model, we analyze the evolution of an idealized gas accretion
stream into a halo of 1013 M‚äôat z=2 (¬ü 2.5.4). In Section 2.5.5, we discuss why
simulations may be missing some ingredients necessary for modeling accretion
shocks robustly and outline a few simple consequences of our proposed scenario.
2.5.2
Our framework for multi-phased streams
The idea that gas in halos is multiphase has been suggested for decades (e.g.,
Binney, 1977; Maller & Bullock, 2004). More recent studies of halo gas attribute
the development of multiphase gas to the growth of local thermal instabilities (e.g.,
Sharma et al., 2010) or galaxy outows (e.g., Thompson et al., 2016; Hayes et al.,
2016). Thermal instability is only relevant when the cooling time of the unstable
gas is of the same order-of- magnitude or smaller than the dynamical time of
the halo (e.g., Sharma et al., 2012a; McCourt et al., 2012). In ambient halo gas
and outows from galaxies, the gas must often meet this requirement given that
they are observed to be multiphase. However, in an accreting stream of gas, it is
dicult to understand how the gas might achieve such a balance in heating and
cooling. We may have to consider other processes to determine if it is possible
for streams themselves to become multiphased as they ow into the halo. In the
following sections, we examine the physics of gas owing into halos from cosmic
web laments.
39

Figure 2.1: Sketch of our phenomenological picture of ows of gas passing through
a virial shock.
The initial inowing gas (in blue) is over-dense relative to the
halo gas at the boundary by a factor f (=œÅ0/œÅH or the stream density divided by
the density of the ambient halo gas at the virial radius), shocks at the boundary
between the inter-galactic medium (labeled as IGM) and the hot halo gas (labeled
as halo). The persistent virial shock and the higher pressure of the post-shock gas
compared to the ambient halo gas, allows the ow to expand after being shocked
(labeled as expansion). The post-shock gas may become unstable, fragmenting
to form a biphasic medium. The fragmentation enables a fraction of the initial
momentum and energy of the stream to be captured as turbulent clouds of warm
gas with a dispersion, œÉturb, and a volume-lling factor, œÜv,w. The clouds may
move beyond the initial radius of the stream, de-collimating the ow. Eventually,
the hot post-shock gas mixes with the ambient halo gas which prevents it from
cooling further. See text and the Appendix for denitions of the variables.
40

Qualitative sketch of our specic framework
We briey qualitatively outline our scenario of gas accretion through streams,
sketched in Fig. 2.1, introducing the concepts developed later in the paper. We
consider a collimated stream of warm gas with a temperature of 104 K that pen-
etrates into a dark matter halo lled with hot gas at the halo virial temperature.
The smooth density distribution of the hot gas follows the density distribution of
the underlying dark matter halo. The ambient halo gas has a long cooling time
and has constant density and temperature during the ow. The speed of the ow
is set to the virial velocity of the halo and is highly supersonic relative to the sound
speed of the gas within the stream. In the following we introduce the three basic
physical ingredients of our modeling of streams.
As the stream penetrates at the virial radius, we assume it is shock-heated
whenever the hot halo gas provides the necessary pressure support for sustaining
the shock (¬ü 2.5.2). The post-shock gas is over-pressurized relative to the ambient
halo gas and expands, invalidating the classical one-dimensional analysis of streams
(DB06, Mo et al., 2010). The hot post-shock gas mixes with the ambient halo gas,
which prevents much of the gas initially in the stream from cooling completely
to form a monophasic post-shock stream. We further posit that the post-shock
gas will develop inhomogeneities due to, for example, non-planarity or obliqueness
of the shock-front or through inhomogeneities in velocity and/or density of the
stream before it is shocked.
The fragmentation of the gas into hot and warm
cloudy phases is central to our scenario. If certain physical conditions are met,
the expanding inhomogeneous gas will cool and fragment, forming a two phase
medium  a hot phase with an embedded warm cloudy phase (¬ü 2.5.2). Density
and velocity inhomogeneities in the post-shock gas may be amplied through gas
cooling, leading to the formation of a multiphased ow (see ¬ü 2.5.2).
We expect that part of the kinetic energy of the infalling gas will be converted
to turbulence within the warm clouds and random cloud-cloud motions (e.g., Hen-
nebelle & P√©rault, 1999; Kritsuk & Norman, 2002a; Heigl et al., 2017). If the level
of turbulence is high or if the clouds are formed while the gas is expanding, the
warm clouds may spread beyond the initial boundary of the collimated inowing
stream (Fig. 2.1 and see ¬ü 2.5.3). If these conditions are met, the stream will de-
collimate. The thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas in the stream is
largely determined by the timescales of several relevant processes  gas cooling,
expansion of the hot phase, dynamical time of the halo, and the stream disruption
due to turbulent motions  which we quantify in the remainder of this and the
next section.

The Impact of Expansion on the Phenomenology of Accretion Flows
Since the pioneering work of White & Rees (1978b) decades ago, the accretion
of gas onto galaxies or into halos has been analyzed in one, radial dimension,
assuming homogeneity of the ow (see Mo et al., 2010).
The one-dimensional
approximation is also used for streams, where it is valid only if one can ignore
lateral expansion. To know if this approximation is valid, one has to compare
the expansion to cooling time of the gas within the ow. Historically, even the
analysis of the stability of the accretion shock neglected the possibility that the
post-shock gas may expand into the ambient halo gas gas (DB06;
Mo et al.,
2010). In our study, we reconsider the sustainability of the accretion shock that
occurs as the infalling lament collides with the ambient halo gas. To conduct
this analysis, we compare the cooling time of the post-shock gas to various other
measures of its dynamical evolution. For simplicity, we only compare the cooling
time to the expansion time of the post-shock gas into the surrounding ambient
halo gas and the dynamical time of the halo. Intuitively, one can understand that
if the cooling time is signicantly shorter than either the expansion or dynamical
times, the stream after the shock will quickly cool down and maintain much of
its integrity. Such a shock can be unstable and this is essentially the textbook
situation that has been considered already (Mo et al., 2010). If the cooling time of
the post-shock gas is signicantly longer than either the expansion or dynamical
times, then the post-shock gas will mix the ambient halo gas further supplying
it with hot gas and entropy. This is another textbook example that has been
analyzed one-dimensionally (DB06; Mo et al., 2010). However, if the cooling time
is of the same order-of-magnitude of the expansion and halo dynamical times, a
wider range of outcomes of the post-shock gas are possible (e.g., Sharma et al.,
2010, 2012b). This is the point of this paper  to describe phenomenologically this
more complex regime.
We now consider the impact of expansion on the properties of the post-shock
gas. To estimate the cooling, expansion, and dynamical timescales, we introduce
two parameters specic to the ow, its over-density relative to that of mean density
of gas at the virial radius, f, and the radius of the stream, rstream. All variables
used in this and subsequent sections are summarized in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 of the
Appendix. As we now show, the gas in the stream immediately after being heated
to a high post-shock temperature, Tps, has a pressure, Pps, higher than the ambient
halo gas, PH, and thus expands into the surrounding ambient halo gas of density,
œÅH. All of the post-shock quantities are given by the normal Rankine-Hugoniot
shock relations (see Appendix for appropriate formulae). The halo pressure at the
virial radius is,

the be virial temperature. The pressure ratio just after the shock is,

(2.24)
where g : M1 7‚Üí(2Œ≥/(Œ≥ ‚àí1) ‚àíM ‚àí2
1 )‚àí1. For Œ≥ = 5/3 and within the domain
[1,+‚àû], this function rapidly decreases from 1/4 to 1/5. Hence the pressure ratio,
Pps/PH is between 9/5 and 9/4 times the initial stream over-density, f. Since f‚â≥1,
the pressure of the post-shock gas is higher than the pressure of the ambient halo.
Thus, since the pressure ratio is always greater than one, the ow will expand into
the ambient halo gas.
To dene the expansion time of the ow, we approximate this as the inverse
of the relative rate of change of pressure in the post-shock gas as it expands.
Quantitatively, this is,
texpand = Pps/ ÀôPps = ‚àí2Œ≥rstream/ Àôrstream ‚àº2Œ≥rstream/cps
(2.25)
where rstream is the initial radius of the stream before it expands and cps is the sound
speed of the gas immediately after passing through the shock front. As a rst order
approximation, in the case of a homogeneous post-shock medium, one can easily
compare the cooling and expansion times. Our denition of the expansion time
means it is a dierential measure of the expansion and so the most appropriate
comparison is with the instantaneous cooling time of the gas immediately after the
shock. The isobaric cooling time is dened as,

mass density of the cooling gas, ne is the electronic density and nH the Hydrogen
particle density5.
Hereafter, the cooling time of the post-shock is denoted by,
tcool,ps. We also refer to the cooling time after expansion, noted tcool,pe.
The other timescale with which to compare the cooling time is the dynamical
time of the halo. It is simple to estimate the dynamical time. We estimate the
4¬µ = 0.6 mp for a fully ionized gas.
5The factor 4.3 in Eq. 2.26 comes from ne = 1.2nH and nH ‚âàœÅ/(1.4 mp).

function of halo mass, MH, and stream over-density, f, at redshift, z=2. The colors
represent the log (tcool,pe/tdyn,halo) (Eqs. 2.26 and 2.27) whose corresponding values
are indicated by the color bar. The solid black lines indicate log (tcool,pe/tdyn,halo)
of increasing values of 0 and 1 from the middle to the top of the diagram. Dashed
black lines indicate log (tcool,pe/tdyn,halo)=‚àí1. The white contours indicate values of
log (tcool,ps/texpand) (Eqs. 2.25 and 2.26) equal to 0 and 1 (solid), and ‚àí1 (dashed).
For this analysis, we have assumed log (rstream/rvir)=‚àí1.5. We highlight regions
where the cooling times are signicantly longer than the halo dynamical times as
hot accretion, regions where the cooling time is signicantly shorter than the
dynamical times as cold accretion, and regions where the cooling times are of the
same order-of-magnitude as the dynamical times as multiphase accretion (see
text for details). These labels are illustrative and are not intended to precisely
delineate a clean separation in the timescales.

dynamical time for matter falling from the virial radius with a radial velocity of
v2 (the post-shock velocity) directed at the center of the potential as,
tÔ¨Ä= Œ±rvir
v2
‚âàtdyn,halo
(2.27)
For this estimate, we assume a NFW dark matter potential (Navarro et al., 1997)
and Œ±, is a factor of-order unity to account for the integrated gravitational accel-
eration during the fall. Assuming that the characteristic velocity and radius are
the virial values, vvir and rvir, the dynamical time is independent of halo mass (Mo
et al., 2010).
Fig. 2.2 illustrates how these time scales depend on the post-shock temperature,
directly related to the halo mass (top x-axis) and for a range of relative stream
over-densities, f, and relative stream radii, rstream/rvir at z=2. The initial stream
penetrating the halo gas and the warm post-shock clouds are assumed to have
a temperature of 104 K, which is maintained through external heating processes,
such as the ionization by the meta-galactic ux or ionizing photons from the galaxy
in the halo. Since the post-shock temperatures are proportional to velocity, the
post-shock temperature translates into dark matter halo mass. From this analysis,
we see that the expansion times are almost constant above MH ‚â≥few1010 M‚äôsince
the virial shock is suciently strong such that texpand ‚àùtdyn,halo. As f increases, the
cooling times decrease systematically, which means for low temperatures (low mass
halos at z=2), the cooling time is always less than the expansion time. For very
high mass halos, even for wide streams with relatively high densities, the cooling
time is much longer than the expansion time and can be longer than the halo
dynamical time for low to moderately over-dense laments. A wide range of values
in f and rstream/rvir lead to cooling times that are less than the halo dynamical time
and within an order-of-magnitude of the expansion time. Whenever the expansion
time is comparable to the cooling time, the gas ow will globally cool neither
purely adiabatically or isobarically.
We can understand the competition between these time scales, tcool,ps, tcool,pe,
tdyn,halo, and texpand, more clearly by considering them as a function of the stream
over-density, f, and post-shock temperature or halo mass (Fig. 2.3). For the case
where tcool,ps >>texpd and tcool,pe >tdyn,halo, the post-shock gas will expand rapidly
remaining hot over at least a dynamical time of the halo.
In this regime the
hot post-shock gas will likely mix with the ambient halo gas preventing signicant
cooling. This is akin the hot mode accretion discussed by Dekel and collaborators
(e.g., DB06). In Fig. 2.3, we have labeled this regime, "hot accretion". At the
other extreme in Fig. 2.3, when tcool,ps << texpand and tcool,ps << tdyn,halo, the gas
cools before signicant expansion and before the stream has penetrated deeply into
the halo. Accretion in this regime corresponds to their cold mode accretion and
have labeled it as such in Fig. 2.3. In between these two regimes, tcool,pe, tcool,ps,
46

tdyn,halo, and texpand are all about the same order-of-magnitude. In this regime,
there is not a simple dichotomy between the types of accretion streams  they can
be both hot and warm if the post-shock gas has a range of temperature and/or
densities and the thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas will be more
complicated. We labeled this regime multiphase accretion in Fig. 2.3.
Inhomogeneous infalling streams and post-shock gas: dierential cool-
ing
We now discuss the physical mechanisms behind the development of multiphasic
accretion streams.
Although our previous discussion of the relevant timescales
considered homogeneous streams, density and velocity inhomogeneities may arise
through the dynamics of the shock itself (Kornreich & Scalo, 2000; Sutherland
et al., 2003). Simulations show that stream are not accreted homogeneously but
have substructure in both density and velocity (Nelson et al., 2016).
Inhomo-
geneities may arise due to a range of curvature in accretion shock-fronts, trans-
lating into a range of Mach numbers and post-shock temperatures and densities.
Density uctuations at constant shock velocity will also lead to inhomogeneities in
the post-shock gas in both temperature and density resulting in a range of cooling
times (Guillard et al., 2009). As we now discuss, once such dierential cooling
sets in, it acts like the thermal instability, leading to phase separation in the ow
(Sharma et al., 2012a), but over a nite range of time in the absence of a heating
process balancing cooling of the hot phase.
To understand how the inhomogeneous post-shock gas evolves, we investigate
how small uctuations in the density and/or temperature are amplied. Neglecting
the inuence of any heating process, the radiative cooling is not balanced and there
are no xed equilibrium points. Following closely the development in Sharma et al.
(2012a), we begin with a parcel of gas that is over-dense relative to an ambient
medium. The magnitude of the over-density is, Œ¥ ‚â°|Œ¥œÅ/œÅ| ‚àº|Œ¥ T/T| for isobaric
conditions. The inverse of the eective cooling time of the over-dense gas parcel
relative to the ambient medium is then

Marginally denser gas cools faster than the gas in which it is embedded and
the cooling becomes a runaway process for temperatures below a few 105 K. We
47

refer to this process as dierential cooling". As soon as heterogeneities form in
approximate pressure equilibrium with their surroundings, denser cooler regions of
the gas will cool rapidly, forming clouds, leaving a hotter, rarer, high volume-lling
inter-cloud medium.
Thus, dierential cooling leads to multiphasic post-shock
accretion ows. This is akin to what occurs for thermally unstable gas (Field,
1965) but the phase separation is transient in the absence of a heating process of
the hot gas balancing cooling.
Of course, a natural consequence of dierential cooling is that even for halo
masses where the post-shock gas has on average a long cooling time, gas with
uctuations in temperature or density may locally cool suciently rapidly to form
a multiphased stream.
Analytically, inhomogeneities can be accounted for as is done in phenomenolog-
ical analyses of the formation of stars through the use of probability distribution
functions (PDFs) in gas density and/or temperature (e.g., Hennebelle & Chabrier,
2009). We follow the thermodynamical evolution of the temperature and density
PDFs using the energy equation, namely,
Àôe = ‚àíœÅ Œõ(T)
4.3¬µmp
+ P ÀôœÅ
œÅ2 ,
(2.30)
where e is the specic internal energy.
We illustrate the isobaric evolution of
inhomogeneities in a ow using such an approach in Fig. 2.4. In this illustration,
we consider a log-normal PDF in temperature with a dispersion of œÉT = 0.3 (1œÉ
dispersion of log œÅ
œÅ0 = log T
T0, where œÅ0 and T0 are the initial mean values of the
density and temperature, with corresponding cooling time t0
cool). We have chosen
a gas pressure and mean temperature appropriate for the post-shock gas of a ow
into a massive, 1013 M‚äô, halo at z=2 (see ¬ü 2.5.4). For this illustration, the gas
pressure is P/k = 5.8 √ó 104 K cm‚àí3, and the initial mean temperature T0=2.7 √ó
106 K. We nd that a substantial fraction of the accreting gas cools to 104 K in
a fraction of t0
cool, while the peak of the hot gas temperature PDF does not shift
with time (see Fig. 2.4).
We show in Fig. 2.5 both the mass fraction and volume-lling factor of the gas
that cools to 104 K as a function of time. Note that since the results shown on
Figs. 2.4 and 2.3 are plotted as a function of the initial cooling time t0
cool, to a rst
approximation they are not much dependent on the specic values of œÅ0 and T0.
Those results also apply to the gas cooling after expansion when texpand << t0
cool.
Figure 2.3 shows that the warm gas becomes the dominant mass phase, within
about half of the post-shock cooling time, and that the warm gas only lls a small
fraction of the volume. For a larger value of the temperature dispersion œÉT, Œ¶m,w
increases over a broader range of fractional times distributed around the same
mean value.
48

Figure 2.4: Probability distribution function of the gas temperature at dierent
times for isobaric cooling. The initial distribution (black line) is log-normal with
a dispersion, œÉT = 0.3, and an initial mean gas temperature, T0=2.7 √ó 106 K. The
distribution at a time equal to the initial isobaric gas cooling time is plotted in blue,
that of half and a quarter of this time in red and green, respectively. In the last
column of the legend, we indicate the fraction of the gas that has cooled to 104 K
within the indicated fraction of the cooling time. For example, in this illustration,
after one cooling time, approximate 85% of the gas has cooled to 104 K.
49

In Fig. 2.5, the gas is multiphase for only a few t0
cool. The hot gas eventually
cools because we have not considered any heating processes. However, the pro-
cess of fragmentation of the gas could be sustained if there is heating of the hot
gas. Even in absence of heating, after expansion the hot gas will eventually mix
with the ambient halo gas thus sustaining the hot phase. Possible local sources of
heating for the post-shock gas are the radiative precursor of high velocity shocks,
thermal conduction, radiation from the surrounding hot medium, and dissipation
of turbulence. The mechanical energy input from active galactic nuclei (AGN),
winds generated by intense star formation, and other processes can plausibly bal-
ance the cooling of the hot gas globally (e.g., Best et al., 2007; Raerty et al.,
2008). Overall, there is more than enough energy, but what is unknown is how
and with what eciency this energy is transferred to the streaming gas. Even
though simulations do not capture this process, it has been suggested that the
energy from the galaxy is transferred eciently through turbulent energy cascade
and dissipation (Zhuravleva et al., 2014; Banerjee & Sharma, 2014).
A poignant question to ask is can the owing post-shock gas actually become
multiphase while cooling in a halo dynamical time? It is a dicult question to
answer in the particular case of accretion streams because it depends on how
inhomogeneous the gas is. It will occur if the post-shock conditions are suciently
inhomogeneous. The gas will become multiphased around when tcool,pe is the same
order-of-magnitude as tdyn,halo.
This justies where we placed the multiphase
accretion label in Fig. 2.3. This gure shows that this occurs in the important
mass range of Mhalo‚àº1011 to 1013 M‚äô. The values of course depend on the relative
over-density of the streams (f) and through the characteristics of the halos, on
redshift. Halos within this mass range is where the bulk of stars have formed in
galaxies. Moreover, because the volume lling factor of the warm gas is likely
to be always small, even in the cases where the mass fraction is large, multiphase
streams are likely to be dicult to identify observationally. We discuss this further
in ¬ü 2.5.5.
2.5.3
Consequences of the formation of multiphased, cloudy
accretion ows
Turbulence in warm clouds
As the gas fragments, perhaps due to dierential cooling and/or thermal instabil-
ities, we assume that some of the initial kinetic energy of the stream is converted
into turbulence within the warm component. We parameterize the turbulence af-
ter phase separation as the ratio, Œ∑, of the turbulent energy density of the clouds
and the initial bulk kinetic energy density of the stream. We dene this ratio as,
50

Figure 2.5: The change in the mass fraction, œÜm,w, and the volume lling-factor,
œÜv,w, of the warm, 104 K gas as a function of the post-shock cooling time. The
time scale is expressed in units of the isobaric cooling time, t0
cool as dened in the
text. The values of the pressure and temperature are the same as those used in
Fig. 2.4.
51

(2.31)
where ‚ü®œÅw‚ü©v is the volume-averaged density of the warm clouds (‚ü®œÅw‚ü©v=œÜv,w œÅw,
where œÜv,w is volume-lling factor and œÅw is the density of the warm clouds respec-
tively), œÉturb is the cloud-cloud velocity dispersion, œÅ1 and v1 are the pre-shock gas
density and velocity. We assume that v1 is equal to the virial velocity, vvir. The
initial density of the stream is related to the hot halo density, œÅH, as œÅ1 = fœÅH.
The amount of turbulence generated in the post-shock gas is likely determined by
as yet poorly understood and undoubtedly complex gas physics. In our model we
do not attempt to investigate the complexity involved in this transformation of
energy, we simply parameterize the amount of turbulence by Œ∑ which we allow to
be free (see ¬ü 2.5.3).
As we briey alluded to in ¬ü 2.5.2, as the turbulent energy dissipates, it reheats
the warm clouds, moderating the cooling. The cooling of the clouds will also be
moderated by mixing with the ambient halo gas as the stream penetrates deeper
into the halo potential (Fragile et al., 2004). Dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy
in the hot phase may also contribute to heating the post-shock gas as well as the
radiation from the high-speed accretion shock (Allen et al., 2008). The parameter
Œ∑ may be high enough to provide the required heating of the hot gas in the stream
through turbulent dissipation and mixing with the halo gas, perhaps instigating
thermal instabilities. On the other hand, Œ∑ must be low enough such that turbulent
dissipation and mixing does not prevent instabilities, both thermal and cooling,
from growing in the post-shock gas (Banerjee & Sharma, 2014; Zhuravleva et al.,
2014). These constraints and considerations may ultimately provide limits on how
much or how little turbulence is sustainable in the post-shock gas, but determining
these exact values requires further detailed study and will not be considered here.
Mass and momentum budget of the multiphase medium
We assume that as the stream ows into the halo, its mass owate is conserved
during the post-shock expansion and does not mix immediately with the ambient
halo gas. This leads to the relation,
SœÅ2v2 = œÅ1v1
(2.32)
where œÅ2 is the density after the hot gas has expanded by a factor, S, and similarly,
v2 is its velocity (Fig. 2.1). The expansion factor, S, is dened as the ratio of
the initial over the nal mass uxes (per unit surface perpendicular to the ow).
The post-shock gas will ultimately reach pressure equilibrium with the halo which
implies, œÅwTw = œÅhTh = œÅHTH, where œÅw and œÅh are the densities of the warm
52

and hot components and TH is the temperature of the hot components after phase
separation in the post-shock gas.
Before there is any momentum exchange with the halo gas, the momentum of
the streaming gas is conserved, implying,
S
 œÅ2v2
2 + Œ∑œÅ1v2
1 + PH

= œÅ1v2
1 + P1
(2.33)
where P1 is the initial pressure of the stream. We assume the fragmenting gas
radiates away its heat until reaching a oor temperature, Tw=104 K. The hot
component only cools adiabatically and reversibly (no heat transfer and no entropy
increase) expanding after it passed through the shock front, namely, œÅŒ≥
hPps = œÅŒ≥
psPH,
where Œ≥ is the ratio of specic heats. This approximation holds until the expanding
gas reaches pressure equilibrium with the ambient halo gas.
The expansion factor, S, is derived from Eqs. 2.23, 2.32, and 2.33, as,

(2.34)
The expansion of the stream is important in our formulation. It leads to the mixing
of the expanding post-shock gas with the ambient halo gas. This mixing couples
the hot post-shock gas to the larger energy reservoir of the ambient halo gas which
acts as a thermostat preventing the gas from cooling, thereby possibly maintaining
the pressure necessary to support a sustained shock. As we discussed in ¬ü 2.5.2, it
is the relative ratios of the thermal cooling time and the expansion time that will
inuence how the stream evolves.
Cloudy stream disruption
The relative cloud-cloud motions may lead to the warm clouds spreading beyond
the original radius of the stream. So instead of the streams being highly colli-
mated as we assumed they are initially (before the virial shock), the ows may
de-collimate. This can be thought of as disruption since the warm clouds expand
away from the original trajectory of the stream, thus disrupting the ow. We
dene the timescale for disruption as the cloud crossing time of the stream, namely,
tdisrupt = rstream
œÉturb
(2.35)
œÉturb may be computed from Œ∑, f, and the volume-lling factor of the warm clouds,
œÜv,w. From Eqs. 2.23 and 2.31, assuming pressure equilibrium between gas phases,
yields,

2.5.4
A specic case: 1013 M‚äôhalo at z=2
To gauge whether any of the phenomenology we have discussed is pertinent as-
trophysically, we calculate the stream characteristics for a single dark matter halo
of mass, 1013 M‚äô, at redshift 2. We chose this halo mass and redshift because in
DB06, halos at this mass and redshift were determined to have substantial accre-
tion rates in the hot mode. Our analysis in ¬ü 2.5.2 indicated that this halo mass
and redshift would be a revealing illustration of how the impact of expansion and
accelerated dierential cooling might change the physical characteristics of gas ac-
cretion ows (i.e., it would no longer simply be hot mode accretion). Both the
halo mass and the redshift set the initial stream density and the characteristics
of the halo gas. We provide all the characteristics of the halos and initial gas
conditions in the Appendix.
Why are streams cloudy?
There are two limiting cases to specically consider when attempting to understand
the development of a biphasic stream. The two cases are: (1) texpand ‚â™tcool,ps and
(2) texpand ‚â´tcool,ps. In case (1), the warm phase develops only after the expansion
has occurred, while in case (2) the clouds form before the expansion. We sketch
the thermodynamic evolution (path) of a stream in Fig. 2.6.
To make these
illustrations, we adopted f = 30 and rstream/rvir=0.01 for case (1), and f = 150
and rstream/rvir=0.1 for case (2).
In case (1), clouds ll the entire expanse of the expanded ow.
Adiabatic
expansion occurs before radiative cooling becomes important, the stream cools
and the density of the hot phase declines without a change in entropy. In case (2),
the two phase separate before expansion. In both cases, the hot post-shock gas
reaches pressure equilibrium and mixes with the ambient halo gas.
These two conditions are of course for the extreme cases, in reality, the gas will
have texpand ‚àºtcool,ps (Fig. 2.3). For these intermediate cases, the thermodynamic

as labeled (cf. Eqs. 2.35 and 2.27). We assume a volume-lling factor of 0.1 (see
Fig. 2.5) for the warm clouds and rstream = rvir/10. In regions with values less than
1, the streams are disrupted (¬ü 2.5.4). The shaded region indicates regions that
are forbidden because for these values of the parameters, the post-shock pressure
is less than the halo pressure. We note that because tdisrupt ‚àùœÉ‚àí1
turb, the contours
of constant tdisrupt/tdyn,halo are shaped like contours of constant œÉturb in the same
plane. For example, the contour, tdisrupt/tdyn,halo=0.2, is close to the contour for
œÉturb=200 km s‚àí1, which is almost half the initial velocity of the ow.
56

evolution is more complex, but the clouds reach the same nal thermodynamical
state. The cooling length at the post-shock temperature is the size over which
structures can cool isobarically (i.e., cooling length, Œªcooling,ps =cps tcool,ps). In case
(1), the cooling length is much larger than the stream radius, Œªcooling,ps >>rstream,
clouds may form over all scales within the stream. In case (2), it is much smaller,
Œªcooling,ps << rstream, and clouds may form over a range of sizes smaller than the
stream radius. The expansion of the hot gas does not inhibit the growth of thermal
and dierential cooling instabilities because the decrease in the pressure is roughly
compensated by the decrease of temperature along an adiabat in the expression
of the cooling time. In other words, for the post-shock temperature, i.e., for the
halo mass we have adopted, the gas cooling time remains roughly constant as the
gas expands (Fig. 2.6; see also Fig. 2.2). Eventually, the warm phase equilibrates
at approximately the halo pressure and the hot phase mixes with the halo gas.
We are obviously considering fragmentation on scales much smaller than the scale
height of the gravitational potential well and thus we can safely ignore thermal
stabilization by convection (Balbus & Soker, 1989; Sharma et al., 2010).
Does the accretion ow disrupt?
The only process we consider in determining whether or not the warm clouds will
travel coherently towards the galaxy proper as observed in numerical simulations
(e.g. Brooks et al., 2009; Danovich et al., 2015) is the cloud-cloud velocity disper-
sion. The cloud-cloud dispersion will broaden the stream as it penetrates into the
halo. Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 show contours of tdisrupt/tdyn,halo for a constant rstream
(Eqs. 2.35 and 2.27). We nd that the disruption time is shorter than or approxi-
mately equal to the halo dynamical time. Thus it appears that for a wide range of
relative turbulent energy densities, stream over-densities, and volume-lling fac-
tors of the warm gas, the ows will not simply fall directly into the potential as a
highly collimated, coherent streams. In reality, the clouds are dynamical entities,
we expect clouds to keep forming through cooling as other clouds are destroyed
by hydrodynamic instabilities and heated by dissipation (Cooper et al., 2009).
2.5.5
Discussion
We now discuss broadly how our ndings relate to aspects of galaxy formation and
evolution.
Are virial shocks persistent?
In our scenario, the existence of a hot phase in hydrostatic equilibrium supports a
persistent shock (Binney, 1977; Maller & Bullock, 2004). Cosmological simulations

appear to show a similar phenomenology as that described in DB06. Depending
on the mass of the halo and redshift, streams penetrate at about one to many
100s of km s‚àí1 (van de Voort & Schaye, 2012; Goerdt & Ceverino, 2015b) or much
greater than the sound speed of the stream, cs‚àº10-20 km s‚àí1. Simulated accre-
tion shocks are isothermal at high Mach numbers and not stable (e.g., Nelson
et al., 2016, 2015). Perhaps this uniform isothermality is due to the spatial and
temporal resolutions adopted in the cosmological simulations. The scales that sim-
ulations must probe are roughly delineated in one-dimensional shock calculations.
Raymond (1979) show that atomic shocks with velocities of ‚àº100 km s‚àí1 reach
their post-shock temperatures within a distance of ‚âà1-10 √ó1015 cm in less than
‚àº30 yrs. For higher shock velocities, the spatial and temporal scales will be even
shorter (Allen et al., 2008). The gas cools after the shock on timescales that are at
most only a couple of orders-of-magnitude longer. In addition, in order to capture
the dierential cooling and thermal instabilities in the post-shock gas, resolutions
much ner than the Field length are required (Koyama & Inutsuka, 2004; Gres-
sel, 2009). Simulations should be specically designed to capture the multiphase
nature of streams penetrating halos to test our scenario by resolving the Field
length (Koyama & Inutsuka, 2004). Since the Field length decreases strongly with
decreasing temperature, this is most easily done with ad hoc oor temperature
higher than 104 K but lower than the virial temperature as done for simulating
thermal instabilities in cool core clusters (McCourt et al., 2012).
The resolution and temporal scales necessary to resolve high Mach number
shocks are not achievable in galaxy- or cosmological-scale simulations. To overcome
this limitation, numericists use articial viscosity in the form of a dissipative term
either in dynamical equations or dispersion relations, depending on the properties
of the gas or the ow (e.g., Kritsuk et al., 2011; Price, 2012; Hu et al., 2014; Beck
et al., 2016). Articial viscosity spreads the shock over several resolution elements
enabling simulations to resolve heating and cooling across the shock front. The
Reynolds number is inversely proportional to the kinetic viscosity of the uid.
If the ow properties are unchanged but the viscosity increased, the Reynolds
number of the ow will be articially low. Simulations with articial viscosity have
ows with low Reynolds numbers. Simulated low Re ows, Re ‚â≤1000, tend to be
laminar. Those with low spatial and temporal resolutions, due to not resolving the
Field length and having unrealistical low Reynolds numbers likely fail to produce
biphasic turbulent ows (see, e.g., Kritsuk & Norman, 2002a; Sutherland et al.,
2003; Koyama & Inutsuka, 2004; Kritsuk et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2016,

Nature of Flows into Galaxies: Observational tests
As a consequence of our assumption that all energetic quantities scale as vvir,
the cloud-cloud dispersion is a simple linear function of Œ∑, f, and œÜ‚àí1
v,w.
This
relation implies that turbulent velocities of the warm clouds in the post-shock
gas are independent of both halo mass and redshift. In principle this means that
post-shock streams may be turbulent in any halo at any redshift. The reality is
probably much more complex, through both macro- and microscopic gas physics
which is not yet well-understood, the 2 parameters, Œ∑ and œÜv,w, likely depend on
the accretion velocity and the physical state of the ambient halo gas  both of
which undoubtedly depend on redshift and halo mass.
Our scenario has observationally identiable consequences. If our scenario is re-
alistic, then observations should reveal: (1) clumpy, turbulent streams; (2) strong
signs of the dissipation of turbulent mechanical energy in the warm medium (e.g.,
Guillard et al., 2009; Ogle et al., 2010; Tumlinson et al., 2011). The situation
described in our model where a large fraction of the bulk kinetic energy of the
accretion ow is transfered to turbulent motions amongst cold clouds is observed
in large-scale galaxy colliding ows, like the situation in the Tay Galaxies or the
Stephan's Quintet, where we see evidence for this energy cascade (Peterson et al.,
2012; Cluver et al., 2010). In Stephan's Quintet, two atomic gas laments are col-
liding at ‚àº1000 km s‚àí1 and yet instead of nding intense X-ray emission from the
post-shock gas, most of the bulk kinetic energy is contained in the turbulent energy
of the warm molecular gas (Guillard et al., 2009, 2010). Remarkably, roughly 90%
of the bulk kinetic energy has not been dissipated in the large-scale shock and is
available to drive turbulence. If gas in halos is multiphase and turbulent, then it
may be the case as well for accretion streams.
Obviously, a clumpy stream is dicult to identify as such through absorption
line spectroscopy and this may explain why streams have not been conspicuously
identied so far. This is most obviously seen in Fig. 2.5 where despite a large
fraction of the gas is warm, its volume-lling factor is minuscule. Along most
lines-of-sight, absorption spectroscopy is expected to sample only the hot, high
volume-lling factor halo gas or probe a population of warm ambient halo clouds
(Maller & Bullock, 2004; Tumlinson et al., 2011; Werk et al., 2014). The clouds
should be looked for in emission.
Their emission can be powered by the UV
radiation from the galaxy but also through the localized dissipation of turbulent
energy and through losses of their gravitational potential energy as they fall into
the halo. This may have already been observed in LyŒ± (e.g., Cantalupo et al., 2014;
Martin et al., 2015). In particular, it would be promising to interpret spectral-
imaging observations such as those provided by MUSE on the ESO/VLT within
the context of our scenario (see Borisova et al., 2016; Fumagalli et al., 2016; Vernet
et al., 2017a).
60

Moderating the accretion rate: Biphasic streams and increased coupling
between feedback and accretion
In our phenomenological model, two mechanisms moderate the accretion eciency
on to galaxies: (1) disruption and fragmentation of the ow; (2) interaction be-
tween streams and outows of mass, energy, and momentum due to processes
occurring within galaxies (e.g., AGN, intense star-formation).
First, streams potentially become multiphase and turbulent leading to short
disruption times resulting in de-collimation. Any de-collimation undoubtedly leads
to longer accretion times and thus lower overall accretion eciencies compared to
smooth isothermal streams (Danovich et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2016). The post
shock gas becomes multiphase over a wide range of halo masses at z=2. A fraction
of the initial stream mass ow becomes hot gas and ultimately mixes with the
surrounding ambient hot halo gas. Thus even accretion streams potentially feed
gas into the hot halo which may have long cooling times compared to the halo free
fall time (White & Rees, 1978b; Maller & Bullock, 2004).
Second, simulations indicate that the mass and energy outows from galaxies
can interact with streams, regulating or even stopping the ow of gas (e.g., Ferrara
et al., 2005; Dubois et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015). Simulated
streams are relatively narrow (e.g., Ocvirk et al., 2008a; Nelson et al., 2013, 2016)
and generally penetrate the halo perpendicular to the spin axes of disk galaxies
and their directions are relatively stable for long periods (e.g., Pichon et al., 2011;
Dubois et al., 2014; Welker et al., 2014; Laigle et al., 2015; Codis et al., 2015;
Tillson et al., 2015). Feedback due to mechanical and radiative output of intense
galactic star formation and active galactic nuclei is observed to be highly collimated
in inner regions of disk galaxies (opening angle, ‚Ñ¶‚àºœÄ sr, e.g., Heckman et al.,
1990; Lehnert & Heckman, 1995, 1996; Beir√£o et al., 2015). In the case of dwarf
galaxies, their outows are generally more weakly collimated (e.g., Marlowe et al.,
1995, 1997; Martin, 1998, 2005). The geometry of the accretion ows and the
signicant collimation of outows from galaxies in simulations, result in only weak
direct stream-outow interactions. However, accretion ows in simulations can
be moderated or stopped when the halo gas is pumped with mass and energy
via feedback to suciently high thermal pressures and low halo-stream density
contrasts to induce instabilities in the stream and disrupt it; or when the halo
gas develops a suciently high ram pressure in the inner halo due to angular
momentum exchange between the gas, dark matter, and galaxy disk to disrupt
accretion ows (van de Voort et al., 2011; Dubois et al., 2013; Nelson et al., 2016).
The processes we have described are generic to ows, whether they are inows
or outows. It is only the context and timescales that change (Thompson et al.,
2016). Just as with the accretion ows modeled here, we also expect the galaxy
winds to be highly uncollimated as they ow from the galaxy due to the formation
61

(and destruction) of turbulent clouds. Thus, the generation of turbulent cloudy
media in both accretion ows and starburst-driven outows will allow for ecient
interaction between these two types of ows. This dynamical interaction likely
sustains turbulence in the halo compensating for the dissipation. It is perhaps
through this interaction that galaxies become self-regulating on a halo scale (e.g.,
Fraternali et al., 2013), and not only on a galaxy scale (e.g., Lehnert et al., 2013,
2015).
While the fate of the turbulent clouds is beyond the scope this paper, the qual-
itative implication is that the gas accretion eciency may be moderated through
the generation of turbulence in biphasic ows. The fragmented, turbulent nature
of the gas in streams and outows likely makes their dynamical and thermal in-
teraction and coupling ecient. Note that other mechanisms, like the growth of
Rayleigh√¢¬Ä¬ìTaylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, associated with gas cool-
ing, can also trigger the formation of cold clouds in the surrounding halo (e.g. Kere¬≤
& Hernquist, 2009). Moderating the overall gas accretion eciency onto galax-
ies may help to alleviate two signicant challenges in contemporary astrophysics:
the distribution of the ratio of the baryonic to total halo mass as a function of
halo mass (e.g. Behroozi et al., 2013), where low mass galaxies have especially low
baryon fractions; and the requirement for models to drive extremely massive and
ecient outows to reduce the baryon content of galaxies (e.g., Hopkins et al.,
2012, 2016).
2.5.6
Conclusions
We developed a phenomenological model of lamentary gas accretion, streams,
into dark matter halos. We assume both that streams penetrate ambient hot halo
gas as homogeneous ows of 104 K gas and that they undergo a shock at the virial
radius of the halo. The ingredients of the model, those which sets it apart from
other phenomenological models of gas accretion, are that we assume the virial
shock is sustained, the post-shock gas expands into a ambient hot halo gas, and
through several mechanisms or characteristics of the shock front, the post-shock
gas is inhomogeneous. To gauge whether this model is astrophysically pertinent,
we discuss the thermodynamic evolution of a single stream penetrating a dark
matter halo of mass 1013 M‚äôat z=2. From this analysis, we nd that:
‚Ä¢ The post-shock gas expands into the halo gas and it can fragment due to
dierential cooling and hydrodynamic instabilities. Instabilities lead to the
formation of a biphasic ow. It is the formation of a hot post-shock phase
which mixes with the ambient hot halo gas, ultimately limiting how much
of the gas can cool. As a result of the phase separation and the pressure
provided by the hot post-shock gas, we argue that the virial shock may be
62

sustained. However, we have not analyzed the sustainability of the shock in
detail in this paper.
‚Ä¢ The development of a biphasic medium converts some of the bulk kinetic
energy into random turbulent motions in the gas (e.g., Hennebelle & P√©rault,
1999; Kritsuk & Norman, 2002a). The turbulent energy cascades from large
to small scales and across gas phases. The ows, while retaining signicant
bulk momentum as they penetrate into the halo, are turbulent with cloud-
cloud dispersion velocities that can be up to 1/2 of the initial velocity of the
stream.
‚Ä¢ For a wide range of turbulent energy densities, our model shows that the
stream will lose coherence in less than a halo dynamical time. We emphasize
that the turbulent energy density is not in reality a free parameter but is
determined by macro- and microscopic multiphase gas physics about which
we have only a rudimentary understanding. To understand what processes
regulate the amount of turbulence in streams, high resolution simulations of
accreting gas need to be made and additional multi-wavelength observations
useful for constraining the properties of turbulent astrophysical ows are
necessary.
The post-virial shock gas is not isothermal, accretion streams are both hot
and cold. The hot-cold dichotomy (see DB06) is no longer a simple function of
whether or not the shock is stable, but now relies both on the shock occurring and
under what circumstances the post-shock gas becomes multiphase and turbulent.
However, we have discussed may apply if there is no virial shock provided that
inowing gas is hot and already inhomogeneous (Kang et al., 2005; Cen & Ostriker,
2006). Thus, even in absence of a virial shock, the gas may become multiphased
by compression as it falls deeper into the halo potential.
Moderating the gas accretion eciencies on to galaxies through this and other
mechanisms may help to alleviate some signicant challenges in theoretical astro-
physics. If gas accretion is actually not highly ecient, then perhaps models will
no longer have to rely on highly mass-loaded outows to regulate the gas content
of galaxies. It is likely that the underlying physical mechanisms for regulating the
mass ow rates and evolution of outows are very similar to those that regulate
gas accretion (Thompson et al., 2016). If so, then observing outows in detail can
provide additional constraints on the physics of astrophysical ows generally. We
do not only have to rely on apparently challenging detections of direct accretion
onto galaxies.

2.5.7
Parameters in the model
The quantities that are important in setting the initial conditions of the stream-
ambient halo gas interaction are the mass, virial velocity, and virial radius of
the dark matter halo which we denote as MH, vvir, and rvir. The dark matter
distribution is given by a NFW prole with a concentration parameter, c, of 10
(Navarro et al., 1997). The halo is lled by a hot gas of temperature TH, which
we assume to be equal to the virial temperature of the halo, Tvir. The density of
the hot halo, œÅH, is assumed to follow that of the dark matter density with radius,
but is multiplied by the cosmological baryon density relative to the dark matter
density, fB = 0.18. This is ‚âà37fBœÅcrit, where œÅcrit is the critical density of the
Universe. The halo pressure, PH, is related to TH and œÅH. The lling factor of
this gas is assumed to be one. We are agnostic about how this hot, high volume-
lling factor halo at the virial temperature formed but note that it likely forms
by a combination of accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium and heating
through the radiative and mechanical energy output of the galaxy embedded in
the halo (e.g., Suresh et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015).

The gas accretes through a stream of infalling gas with radius, rstream, we
assume that it passes through a shock and that the properties of the post-shock
gas is given by the standard set of shock equations. We simply scale the density of
the accreting stream by a factor, f, which is its density contrast of the background
dark matter density at the virial radius multiplied by the cosmological baryon
fraction (i.e., œÅH). We further assume that there is a temperature oor in the
post-shock gas of 104 K. We assumed this temperature mainly because we also
assume that the metallicity of the accreting stream is 10‚àí3 of the solar value. The
gas cannot cool much beyond 104 K due to it lacking heavy metals (and is likely
heated by the meta-galactic ux and the ionizing eld of the galaxy embedded
in the halo). This assumption, although naive, is also extremely conservative in

that this implies the post-shock gas will have one of the longest possible radiative
cooling time (see Sutherland & Dopita, 1993; Gnat & Sternberg, 2007). We use
the cooling curve, Œõ(T), from Gnat & Sternberg (2007) to compute the cooling
times in the post-shock gas. We assume that the temperature of the gas in the
stream before passing through the shock is also 104 K (T1). At those temperatures
and very low metallicity, we assume that no molecules form, so that the adiabatic
index of the gases is always that of a monatomic gas, namely Œ≥ = 5/3.
The parameters we use in the model, given our assumed mass and redshift are
given in Table 2.1. We enumerate for completeness and clarity all variables used
in our analysis in Table 2.2.
2.5.8
Idealized model of a time-evolving multiphase medium
I implemented a numerical model to follow the dierential cooling of an initially
slightly heterogeneous medium. The width of the initial log-normal distribution of
the temperatures, Œ¥, is the determinant factor for growing a multiphased medium.
I made simple analytic approximations for the time evolution of mass- and volume
fraction of cool gas. Then I correlated the parameters of the analytical function
with the initial distribution and draw preliminary physical conclusions. I further
show how these correlations may be constrained by the output of our main model
and state physical limitations. Afterwards, I implement a turbulent heating source,
followed by the implementation of a scheme resembling a typical expansion of the
pressurized gas in the hot halo.
Approximation of the time evolution of inhomogeneous gas
I developed a simple model for the evolution of an initially slightly inhomogeneous
medium to a multiphase (warm+hot) medium. Assuming
‚Ä¢ no cosmological context;
‚Ä¢ gas is perfect with adiabatic index Œ≥ = 5/3;
‚Ä¢ pressure is homogeneous at all times;
‚Ä¢ cooling is isobaric (dP/dt = 0);
‚Ä¢ temperatures (and thus densities) are initially log-normally distributed,
we can numerically compute the thermal evolution of the distribution. This can
be done either by a sampling-based or a discretized distribution function-based,
nite-dierence method.
66

The log-normal distribution is usually relevant to isothermal turbulent media
(Passot & V√°zquez-Semadeni, 1998), but we chose the simplest one knowing that
when the eective adiabatic index is more (less) than one, power-law tails should
appear at low (high) densities.
This is dened by the probability distribution
function:
pdf(T) =
1
TŒ¥‚àöœÄ exp

‚àílog(T/Ti)2
2Œ¥2

(2.37)
where Ti is the initial peak temperature and Œ¥ is the initial dispersion.
The sampling-based method can be described as the following. Given a pressure
P, we sample N values ÀúTi (i ‚ààN, 1 ‚â§i ‚â§N) from a normal probability law.
These values represent the temperatures of N particles, through ÀúTi = log(Ti), only
coupled by their common pressure. Their densities are derived from the law of
perfect gases.
Each has a specic energy ei = (Œ≥ ‚àí1)kBTi/¬µmp, subject to a
(discrete-)time evolution:
‚àÄi, log10 ei(t + ‚àÜt) = log10 ei(t) ‚àí‚àÜt/tcool,i(t)
(2.38)
and similarly, due to the constant pressure,
‚àÄi, log10 œÅi(t + ‚àÜt) = log10 œÅi(t) + ‚àÜt/tcool,i(t)
(2.39)
where the cooling time of a particle i at time t is dened by:
tcool,i(t) =
4Œ≥¬µmpkBTi(t)
(Œ≥ ‚àí1)œÅi(t)Œõ(Ti(t), Z)
(2.40)
Say that we split the distribution, at any time, in two sets, depending on the
value of the temperature T relative to an arbitrary threshold Tc = 104 K + œµT,
where œµT ‚â™Tc. Below this value lies the warm component, above it lies the hot
one. We are then able to follow the time evolution of the warm mass fraction, as
well as its volume-lling factor. The initial dominant cooling time, tcool,0, is the
one corresponding to the peak value of the distribution.
The warm mass fraction is dened by:
œÜm,w(t) = #{i|Ti(t) < Tc}/N
(2.41)
and the hot one is simply œÜm,h = 1 ‚àíœÜm,w. A perfect illustration of this fraction
can be found in Fig. 3 of Kritsuk & Norman (2002b). The volume-lling factor of
the warm component is:
œÜv,w(t) =
P
{i|Ti(t)<Tc} 1/œÅi(t)
P
{i} 1/œÅi(t)
(2.42)
67

and the hot one is simply œÜv,h = 1 ‚àíœÜv,w.
Running this code for N ‚Ä≤ = 10 values of Œ¥ in [0.01,1], the curves of each
fraction is plotted against time. As distribution cools, the process slows down,
i.e. the absolute value of time derivatives of mass fractions decrease. Thus we
adopt as a time variable the logarithm of t divided by the characteristic time,
the initial cooling time of the mean of the PDF in temperature, tcool,0. Denoting
Œò = log10(t/tcool,0), we found an excellent tting function dened with the two
parameters by:

then the following approximation is found:

where ‚àó‚àà{m, v} denotes a quantity pertaining to the mass or the volume, and

1/2 and ‚àÜ‚àóare functions of the initial dispersion of the log of temperatures Œ¥.
The former is the log-time at which the fraction reaches 50% and the latter is the
lag between ‚àº31% and ‚àº69%.
Fitting the two parameters
I will apply this calculation to the previously discussed specic halo with a mass of
1013 M‚äôat z = 2. The input parameters must then match the post-shock physical
quantities. With the following initial conditions:
‚Ä¢ P/kB = 5.8 104 K.cm‚àí3
‚Ä¢ pdf(log(T)) = N(2.7 106 K, Œ¥)
‚Ä¢ Z = 0

1/2 is independent of Œ¥, so that the warm mass fraction reaches 50% at a
xed time. That is, half the mass has cooled after ‚àº0.55 times the initial
dominant cooling time, no matter the exact initial dispersion of the PDF.
‚Ä¢ ‚àÜm is proportional to Œ¥, so the higher the initial dispersion, the sooner the
medium becomes multiphase and the longer it takes to cool completely.
‚Ä¢ Œòv
1/2 increases with Œ¥, so that the warm mass fraction reaches 50% with a
delay compared to the increase in the mass fraction. This delay increases
linearly with Œ¥. It implies that during the timelag, the warm mass fraction
is much higher than the volume-lling factor.
‚Ä¢ ‚àÜv is proportional to Œ¥, implying the same conclusion as for ‚àÜm. Note that
the volume-lling factor reaches 1 at a faster rate than the mass fraction,
since ‚àÜv/‚àÜm ‚âà1/2.

with Œ± a coecient depending on the ratio œÅw/œÅh. This dependence is nonlinear
but, again, the function can be numerically interpolated.
What does it mean? If we know the density ratio, there is a one-to-one map
between the initial dispersion and the time it took to grow this multiphase medium.
Note that there are important caveats.
Pressure evolution  In our model, the gas has expanded so that a perfectly iso-
baric transformation should not apply. However, this is a realistic way of gaining
conservative information on the time the process took and on the initial (post-
shock) dispersions.
Indeed, the loss of pressure by mechanical adjustment to
the environment should slow down the cooling so that the times obtained by the
method described above are lower bounds to a more physically accurate estimate
of the cooling time.
Stationarity  Our model explicitly states that the processes are stationary, even-
tually reaching an asymptotic multiphase state. Here in this sort theoretical study,
the whole medium must always end up cool. This can be balanced by a turbulent
heating term which stops the cooling at a certain asymptotic mass fraction. Given
the order of magnitude of the times considered, an other important ingredient
should be added that compensates the coolingnamely the cosmic expansion.
2.5.9
Further: more realistic conditions
Since we wanted to describe the evolution of a cylindrically symmetric ow repre-
senting an IGF, we may want to implement additional constraints and processes.
Here are two major propositions on mechanisms that could be implemented to
obtain more realistic results, in particular for expanding post-shock streams.
Mimicking the expansion  Pressure equilibrium with the ambient halo must
be reached. Ideally, without radiative cooling, we expect it to be adiabatic and
reversible.
To mimic the physical situation, we should write the equations for
the expansion so that a vanishing cooling rate implies the adiabatic law for gases
(P ‚àùœÅŒ≥).
A more physically robust model would include spatial gradients
the outer envelope rst expands and the rarefaction wave propagates toward the
71

axis into the medium, at any instant, leading to a pressure eld with a cylindrical
geometry. Moreover, the initial conditions should not represent a purely cylindrical
discontinuity (there would be unrealistic shocks propagating in the lament and
the halo) but perhaps at its most basic level, a layered model that would smooth
the radial proles, using knowledge gained from the simulation (see Chap. 3).
Radiative loss and spatial scales  Imposing a constant pressure is valid as
long as the expansion and the cooling occur one after the other.
When they
are concurrent, the pressure drops along with the radiative losses. The parcel of
gas under this condition either exerts or receives no mechanical work, in which
case its average density is conserved, or work is done and it must be accounted
for. In a sense, this is scale-dependent, so that the former case corresponds to
smallest space scales, the latter to larger ones; their separation is governed by time
ratios. For thin cylindrical shells, the sound-crossing time is much shorter than
the thermal evolution timescale and the pressure loss is only due to the radiative
loss, without work being exchanged between neighboring shells. The outer shells
would experience such a work exchange because of higher pressure gradients with
their neighbours. One must also account for the fact that the expansion is initially
fast and slows down to an asymptotic mechanical equilibrium: the sound-crossing
time also evolves.
2.6
Concluding remarks
We have developed a phenomenological model for the evolution of the gas stream
immediately following a virial shock. However, in several ways, the model left
important open questions. These questions are:
‚Ä¢ Is there a heating process that prevents the hot post-shock gas from cooling
signicantly? In Section 2.5, we mention mixing with the hot halo gas and
turbulent heating as such possible processes. These two processes need to
be investigated with numerical simulations.
‚Ä¢ How strongly do outows and inow couple? Such a coupling is a natural
way of regulating or moderating galaxy growth. Through the expansion of
the post-shock gas and warm clouds will amplify its cross section outows
from the galaxy hosted within the halo. The physics behind such coupling
and its eciency should be investigated numerically.
‚Ä¢ Are there any observational tests of our scenario? Current observations may
already provide observational constraints but we are still missing an inter-
face our scenario and observables. Phenomenological and numerical studies
72

should be post-processed to compute intensity of cooling lines and absorp-
tion columns. For example, the gas which is cooling into the warm clouds
and its subsequent passage into the halo, may be a relatively prodigious
producer of LyŒ± photons (see Vernet et al., 2017b, for example).
‚Ä¢ What are initial physical conditions of gas penetrating halos from cosmic la-
ments? For the stream to become bi-phasic, the temperature and/or density
of the post-shock gas must be initially inhomogeneous. It is the degree of
this inhomogeneity that sets the timescale over which the medium becomes
bi-phasic. Determining this requires us to investigate the thermodynamics of
the lament before it penetrates the halo. We discuss this further in the next
chapter relying on numerical simulations and analogy with the development
presented here.

Structure and dynamics of
intergalactic laments at z ‚âà2
Abstract
By means of an adaptive mesh-renement code, we performed a zoom-in simulation
of a specic halo and extracted the data pertaining to one of its accreting inter-
galactic laments. After having presented the need for a simulation, we shortly
describe the code Ramses. We address the common view of an IGF as a pure
cylinder and detail the radial and angular properties of its gaseous component.
Some key quantities are studied as they evolve along the lament and we derive a
rened paradigm to study IGFs, as well as consequences regarding their fate after
entering the target halo. We nally made use of the accessible data to extrapolate
some subgrid physical processes which the simulation must have missed.

3.1
First motivations
After having devised a frame in which our phenomenological model applies (see
Chap. 2), constraining the free parameters was the new issue. One way to con-
strain at least the overdensity factor f and the stream radius rstream was to use a
numerical simulation. To obtain values as realistic as possible, cosmological con-
ditions had to be set initially. And to be able to extract the relevant quantities,
a focused zoom-in was needed. This is why we decided to get closer to Yohan
Dubois, who presented us the code Ramses.
An in-depth analysis of an intergalactic lament revealed a great richness of
information that could be advantageously related to our problems. The analogy
we found between halo accretion and lament accretion has proven to be more
profound than initially thought: the very processes involved in our phenomeno-
logical modelling, namely thermal fragmentation and turbulence, were as likely to
occur in the lamentary context. This convinced us to clarify and organize our
ndings.
3.2
Rationale
We exposed in the introduction the importance of intergalactic laments (IGFs)
as a major channel for the material needed to build galaxies. The study of the so-
called cold-mode accretion (eg. Birnboim & Dekel, 2003; Kere¬≤ et al., 2005; Dekel
& Birnboim, 2006; Ocvirk et al., 2008b; Dekel et al., 2009) was mainly focused on
the thermal state of the gas when it has already entered the accreting halo and its
possible fate if and when it reaches the hosted galaxy. On the other hand, following
the initial theoretical works1 from Hoyle (1951); Peebles (1969); Doroshkevich
(1970); White (1984), further investigations were made about the eect of a tidal
torque on laments (may they bind galactic halos or even cluster halos) and the
results on the halo spin and galactic rotation by deposition of angular momentum
(eg. Pichon et al., 2011; Powell et al., 2011; Stewart et al., 2011; Libeskind et al.,
2013a,b; Stewart et al., 2013; Danovich et al., 2015; Tillson et al., 2015; Codis
et al., 2015). As well, some of their internal rotational structure in the form of a
quadrupole of vorticity has been detailed from numerical simulations (eg. Pichon
& Bernardeau, 1999; Laigle et al., 2015; Codis et al., 2015).
As far as lamentary structures are concerned, the most advanced eld so far is
that of interstellar laments (ISFs), where gas radiatively cools and is further con-
ned gravitationnally (eg. Heitsch, 2013b,a; G√≥mez & V√°zquez-Semadeni, 2014)
or by turbulent motions of the ISM (eg. Padoan et al., 2001; Andr√© et al., 2010).
This advance is mainly due to the possibility of observing molecular gas in these
1Those works contitute the Tidal Torque Theory, or TTT.
77

structures (Nutter et al., 2008; Andr√© et al., 2010; Schmalzl et al., 2010; Arzou-
manian et al., 2011; Hill et al., 2011; Juvela et al., 2012). The main dierence
between IGFs and ISFs is the role of the cooling: it initiates the condensation of
ISFs whereas it is induced by the gravity-driven condensation of IGFs.
This knowledge is however a great benet. It allowed a discrimination and a
renement of previous theories owing to cylindrical stationary structures especially
in the case of an isothermal gas but also in polytropic cases (eg. Chandrasekhar
& Fermi, 1953; Stod√≥lkiewicz, 1963; Simon, 1963; Ostriker, 1964a; Fridman &
Polyachenko, 1985). Of course, the isothermal case is well adapted to ISFs, but
could fail in a complete description of IGFs where the thermal equilibrium is much
longer ot reach. The polytropic case is more general (the isothermal case is recov-
ered when the polytropic index tends to ¬±‚àû) and we will test the consequences
of the related Lane-Emden equation in our data.
More precisely, the state of the cold core needs to be investigated further, as it
is the basis of any cold mode accretion. The conditions under which such a core
may collapse due to radiative cooling have been studied by Gray & Scannapieco
(2013) by relating the densities and metallicities of the gas with the redshift.
The consequences on the DM-gas decoupling, as well as linear masses of gaseous
laments were statistically derived from a cosmological simulation at z ‚âà5 by
Harford et al. (2008); Harford & Hamilton (2011).
The gas dynamics in IGFs, its thermal evolution from its outskirts to its axial
core and the possible phenomena that would be missed by the simulation but traced
through large scale clues, all remain to be inquired into. In order to complete the
current knowledge, we will bring some answers to the four questions:
‚Ä¢ Is the cylindrical description accurate? Under which conditions?
‚Ä¢ What are the typical scales of a quantitative description of an IGF?
‚Ä¢ What is the physical state of the gaseous IGF before the halo-entry?
‚Ä¢ Do its dynamics aect its thermal state?
3.3
Numerical method
We here present the numerical means used to accurately time-integrate a limited
set of physical equations, relevant to the evolution of the Universe, and down to
the desired scale. The recording of successive states of the integration let us choose
an accurate and realistic basis for a numerical study of IGFs.
78

3.3.1
The Ramses code
Ramses is a code initially designed and programmed by Romain Teyssier (Teyssier,
2002). It is remarkable by its association of an N-body simulation to describe the
evolution of a set of dark matter particles with a grid whose local resolution may
adapt dynamically and increase in regions of interestnamely an adaptive mesh
renementto describe the evolution of elds pertaining to gas physics: density,
pressure, velocity components, and metallicity.
The numerical scheme used to
integrate the hydrodynamic equations employs a high-order Godunov solver with
total variation diminishing interpolation of cell-centered quantities at interfaces of
cells in order to solve one-dimensional Riemann problems. It is designed to ensure
the conservation of physical quantities: mass, momentum, energy, and, if needed,
chemical abundances, and so on. It is also very ecient in capturing shocks, which
is an ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysics.
The renement consists in dividing locally the side of a mesh cell by twowhich
means splitting each tridimensional cubic cell in eight smaller cubes to reach one
higher level of renementfor each cell of gas whose mass crosses a predened
ceiling value. When matter condenses, the mass in the cell increases up to the
ceiling, then is split in eight until further condensation, so that the mass of a cell
of any level is comprised in a relatively narrow interval, all cells having the same
mass, in a factor of eight.
3.3.2
Cosmological simulation
We performed rst a dark matter-only cosmological simulation. Cosmological pa-
rameters for this simulations include the Hubble constant H0 = 70.3 km.s‚àí1.Mpc‚àí1,
a matter-to-total mass-energy ratio ‚Ñ¶m = 0.276, a at Universe (so ‚Ñ¶Œõ = 1‚àí‚Ñ¶m =
0.724), a baryonic fraction fb ‚âà0.1603, an amplitude of the initial matter power-
spectrum œÉ8 = 0.811. Physical parameters specify that the side of the cubic box
is L = 100 Mpc.h‚àí1 in comoving coordinates, i.e. L ‚âà142.2 Mpc with our choice
for H0. Numerical parameters were set so that the boundary conditions for the
simulation box are periodic conditions. The primary, coarse resolution is set to
‚àÜx ‚âà556 kpc and this corresponds to a 2563 3-d grid, which we will refer from
now on as level 8, since 28 = 256. Snapshots of the simulation were output from
initial redshift of zini = 100 down to zÔ¨Ån = 0.
The retained output for this study corresponds to an equivalent redshift of z =
2.121. A code used to detect halos and subhalos was then run on the outputs. This
program is HaloMaker (Tweed et al., 2009), set up to nd halos with Adaptahop
(see the appendix of Aubert et al. (2004)).
It provides a halo tree with their
masses and equivalent virial parameters. From this catalogue, we selected a halo
of 12.6 1011 M‚äôat redshift z ‚âà2.
79

3.3.3
Zoom-in
Using one of the software tools provided with Ramses, namely geticref, we managed
to extract the identity of all dark matter particles contained in a sphere of radius 3
times the virial radius of the desired halo and sharing the same center. The initial
positions of all particles being known, it is then possible to determine the envelope
of the initial region of space that will condense to form the said halo. Using the
software tool MUSIC (implementation and algorithm, see Hahn & Abel (2011)), a
new set of initial conditions was produced, so as to reach the renement level 12
in the region of interest. This time, gas is present, cooling follows the interpolated
function from Sutherland & Dopita (1993) for a pristine gas (i.e. metal-free) and
with no star formation.
A run is then launched with a maximal rening level 17. Let us recall that the
nest cells have then a size corresponding to a (217)3 simulation, which is 348 pc
of side .
From this new simulated data, we extract again a catalogue of halos with
HaloMaker. Inside the region of interest, we noticed that the higher resolution, and
especially the ner particles, allowed for fragmentation so that the mass initially
contained in the targetted halo has split into several smaller ones. The halo we
selected has a mass of 2.78 1011 M‚äô. Its evaluated size is rhalo = 190.34 kpc and
the virial radius given by the code is 58.5 kpc. This discrepancy already shows
that the detected halo is not spherical. The rst value has been used as unitary
in all computations.
3.4
Study in cylindrical geometry
We here consider the studied lament in cylindrical coordinates. This geometry
may seem obvious when tackling objects like laments, but it would also be naive,
as we will see, to model laments as purely cylindrically symmetric regions. As
matter falls onto the lament and itself and its environment are pulled by a halo
gravitational well, all cylindrical coordinates are relevant, because we expect the
lament to be at the intersection of sheet-like structures. The possible coordinate
separation and the departure from symmetry are then tested.
The radius from the axis is denoted r. The altitude, i.e. the distance to the
center of the halo, is Œ∂. The azimuthal coordinate is Œ∏. The adjective transverse
is used whenever Œ∂ is xed, while longitudinal stands for functions depending on
Œ∂ only.
The use of cylindrical coordinates (r, Œ∏, Œ∂) rst requires dening a frame of
reference.
After having done so (3.4.1), we then set limitations helping dene
correct projections of the simulated data (3.4.2).
80

Figure 3.1: A view of the halo, with emphasis on the densities characteristic of
IGFs. The cube has a side of 381 kpc and densities in the color bar range from
10‚àí30 to 10‚àí22 g.cm‚àí3, from which is only displayed a thin band around one to a
few 10‚àí28 g.cm‚àí3.
3.4.1
Choice of a reference frame
Simplest theoretical expectation: axis as a halo-halo linear bond  Fil-
aments are by nature denser regions of space connecting even denser nodes, i.e.
halos. Dynamical considerations lead to a simple denition: halo centers lie at
points where the gravitational acceleration converges from all directions; between
two neighbouring halos must exist a saddle-node where convergence is bidimen-
sional and the last dimension is that of a diverging eld; laments are extensions
of this saddle-node until they reach the xed points of halos.
Choice of an origin  The most natural way of setting the origin of the cylindrical
frame is to use the detected center of the nearest halo accreting the studied lament.
Following this choice, the axis of our frame is a ray emerging from the halo and
the Œ∂ coordinate may be interpreted as a distance from the halo center. This ts
with studies of halos where the relevant coordinate is the spherical radius.
Deviation from linearity  Contrary to the simplicity of a cylindrical frame, l-
aments have no reason to be perfect straight lines, since the whole environment is a
81

Figure 3.2: The same view as Fig. 3.1, but with a visible slice in the later exam-
plied lament.
priori highly heterogeneous and the corresponding vector elds highly anisotropic.
Despite this deviation, the interpretation of our results does not suer from it. A
ner approach would consider arcs and an even ner one would track the most
probable sites for saddle-nodes with a gradient-based method. For a rst study,
such a renement is not needed however. We explain further how to control the
amplitude of this deviation.
3.4.2
Studying slices of data
Projecting data is quintessential to multidimensional analysis. The way the data
are originally distributed has a crucial impact on optimizing the projection method.
But optimization is a tedious task that can be partly skipped, whenever its benets
are in fact negligible. This is the balance we sought for.
Desired accuracy
Orders of magnitude and scaling relations  One of
our main goals being to establish not only narrow ranges of values for physical
quantities, but also their gradients and ultimately the possible scaling laws relating
them, so as to discriminate between mutually incompatible theoretical predictions
82

Avoiding the trap of a deceptively high precision  Firstly, the resolution of
the simulation is a frontier. Even excellent methods for interpolating the data will
not create additional relevant values. Secondly, even high-precision values varying
at the scale of the resolution are neither to be fully trusted as a physically exact
variation. Keeping these two considerations in mind, we may design methods of
analysis that are both reliable enough and not resource-consuming.
Width of the slice
We simply look now for a discretization step in the Œ∂ di-
mension. Since the axis of the frame is arbitrary, transverse slices are taken along
planes that are arbitrarily tilted in comparison with the simulation grid. An ex-
cessively thin slice would thus have few to no chance to uniformly capture data
points.
Moreover, the slices need to contain enough points to enhance the in-
evitable signal-to-noise ratio resulting from discretization. If too big a cell is cut
by the slice but its center falls out of the slab, the space it occupied will be con-
sidered empty, damaging the analysis. In a way, we could say that the wider the
slice, the smoother the projected elds. And on the other hand, the wider the
slice, the more it will capture uctuations, articially blurring gradients.
The best estimate for the width 2Œ¥Œ∂ took into account the density of data and
the fact that maps should noticeably be dierent between Œ∂ and Œ∂ + Œ¥Œ∂. Its value
has been taken to be Œ¥Œ∂ ‚âà7.14 kpc.
Assigning a corrected origin to the slice
Having cut a slice, and given the
fact that the lament itself is not perfectly linear, a local centering is needed. To
give a proper origin in the planar frame, we use a simple method called shrinking
disk. The principle is to evaluate the 2D coordinates of the barycenter of all points
in the 3D slice and then iteratively reduce the size of the disk, evaluate the new
barycenter, and so on. Doing so, from a radius of 150 kpc down to the smallest
size of a grid cell in that slice (say 350 pc), dividing each radius by 1.1, the loop
converges to a density peak inside the slice of lament.
It is possible then to retrieve all detected centers, slice by slice, to draw a polyg-
onal chain that matches more closely the density valley. However, this method does
not accurately correct the bias introduced by the linear approximation for the l-
ament axis. This is because the direction of the planes is still taken constant and
equal to the initial halo-halo bond direction, rather than parallel to the local line
element.
83

3.5
Anatomy of a transverse slice
3.5.1
Structure and scales
The rst thing to remark about laments is their structure. To highlight it, trans-
verse maps are a good means. After having detailed the distribution of matter, we
will present scalar properties of the dynamics.
Density eld
The supporting gure of this subsection is Fig. 3.3, made of four color maps. To
exemplify the structure, we chose a transverse slice taken at 343 kpc from the
center of the closest halo, which corresponds to about 1.8 times its virial radius.
The colors correspond to rounded values instead of continuously varying ones, so
that a color change draws a constant-value contour-line.
Dark matter
The lower-left panel shows the dark matter distribution, as well
as three circles used as guides to the eye. They are centered on the slice origin,
dened in the way described above. Their radii are equally spaced: 30, 90, and
150 kpc.
Structuration voidsheetlament  The contours are far from isotropic out-
side of the innermost circle and above 90 kpc from the origin, three lobes are
apparent: two are roughly aligned in an east-west direction, while the one at
south-east seems to host a dense blob. The latter is common to all the transverse
slices, meaning that there is a lighter companion lament, that merges with the
main one after their plundging in the halo. The former ones indicate the presence
of a dense corridor, also found in every slice, thus corresponding to a dense sheet-
like structure. The least dense regions on the map are then the ones commonly
referred to as voids.
Typical densities  The closest to the origin of the gure, the more isotropic are
the DM density contours. The region which is apparently relevant to a lamentary
description is inside the 90 kpc-radius circle. For the selected halo and at the given
altitude, the densities inside this disc range from a few 10‚àí29 to a few 10‚àí28 g.cm‚àí3,
with a relatively low gradient. These values are to be compared to the critical
density of the Universe at z ‚àº2, which is slightly less than 10‚àí28 g.cm‚àí3. The
DM overdensity is therefore to be compared to ‚Ñ¶DMœÅcrit ‚âà2.4 10‚àí29 g.cm‚àí3, thus
comprised in a range 1 ‚àí10, indicating that the condensation is rather smooth.
Analogy with halos  If it was a slice cutting through a halo, we could think
of a radially decreasing density with lamentary extensions. We can propose the
following analogy; a lament is a dense cylindrical structure connected to other
laments by less dense, radially extended sheets in the same way halos are spherical

dense structures connected to other halos by less dense, radially extended laments.
This analogy is to be completed further and this will prove fruitful in understanding
the dynamics and growth of laments.
Gas
The upper-left panel shows the gas distribution. The three same circles as
before are shown.
Sharper structuration  The anisotropies of DM density are recognizable, ex-
cept that they are much sharper. The east-west sheet, the companion lament as
well as the continuation (western) of a dilute sheet aligned with the one crossing
the companion (south-western) are visible. As opposed to the DM distribution,
the most isotropic contours lie within a radius of 30 kpc and exhibits two small
lobes, perpendicular to the sheet direction. We will further explain these.
Typical densities  Inside the innermost circle, densities range from a few 10‚àí29
to up to a few 10‚àí27 g.cm‚àí3 at the computed origin. This already indicates much
stronger radial density gradients than DM. The presence of a much denser, tiny
(
3 kpc radius) region in slices of altitudes down to less than one virial radius
follow what we will call the dense axial core, or simply core of the lament.
Compared to ‚Ñ¶bœÅcrit ‚âà4.57 10‚àí30 g.cm‚àí3, this represents an overdensity ranging
from 10 to 1000.
Baryonic fraction
The lower-right panel shows the baryonic fraction, dened
as fb = œÅ/(œÅ + œÅDM), where œÅ and œÅDM are the locally computed densities of gas
and dark matter, respectively. Note that the smoothing that resulted from the
DM density computation is important to this representation, as sharp DM clumps
would have dominated it otherwise.
Interpreting fb  The values of the baryonic fraction need to be compared with
the cosmic value. This value is a constant all along the cosmological run of the
simulation and had been set to fb = 0.1603. On the gure, the black and dark
blue regions exhibit a value lower than the cosmic one. The discrepancy between
the local and the cosmic values is to be seen as the consequence of a decoupling
of gas and dark matter. This decoupling happens whenever the gas is subject to
physical processes which do not occur for dark matter, such as shocks or radiative
cooling, as we are about to see from temperature maps.
Temperature eld
Three important features are to be remarked in the top-right panel of Fig. 3.3, the
one representing the temperature eld in the selected transverse slice.
First, the structure voidssheetslament is as clear as in density maps. Voids
appear cold (< 104 K), walls are hotter (up to a few 105 K). This is consistent with
a scheme where the condensation is associated with compression and thus heating.
86

More, the rightmost sheet, which displays the highest density, appears hotter
than its other counterparts, indicating that it must have resulted from a stronger
compression through its own gas accretion.
But a strong gradient in temperature, around 90 kpc of radius, makes the
lament highly contrasted: a strong shock (density and temperature ratios accross
hint at M ‚àº10 ‚àí15) propagates outwards into the gas from voids. Closer to the
center, the post-shock medium gets cooler and a four-fold structure of a 104.5 ‚àí105
K gas sits there. It will be found later in other elds (see Figs. 3.4, 3.14, 3.15).
Still consistently with the staged condensation aforementioned, the region where
one expects the highest convergence is so compressed that a shock has formed, and
further condensation is allowed by the subsequent loss of pressure due to radiative
cooling. This is in agreement with the baryonic fraction map panelwhere the
post-shock medium extends, gas pressure is so high that it is prevented to collapse
at the same rate DM does, but cooling, as a net pressure leakage term, favors a
secondary condensation which leads to a higher baryonic fraction close to the
axis.
As envisioned by Birnboim et al. (2016) in their cylindrical case, the gas ac-
creting on the IGF can endure a shock. However, we would not try to apply their
stability criterion in our case since our ow greatly diers from the one they as-
sumed. Theirs is purely cylindrical while our accreting sheets break the symmetry
and the shock fron continuity as well, and theirs is homologous while ours is not
even purely radial just beind the shock (see Fig. 3.4).
Nevertheless, we can keep from that work the idea that only the dimension of
the accreting object changes from a sheet, to a lament, to a halo. This reinforces
the analogyi set out above, according to which a lament is subject to the same
kind of accretion-related phenomena as a halo, only with a dierent dimensionality.
Like halos, laments may be surrounded by a shocked corona exhibiting a relative
lack of baryons whereas a central region would host an overrepresentative fraction
of the like.
Dynamics
The upper-left panel of Fig. 3.4 is a colormap of the radial velocity eld. The
bright green contours help identify where it changes sign, that is where the ow
is converging on one side and diverging on the other. Outside 90 kpc, the ow is
purely falling in towards the lament. Inside that radius, a quadrupolar structure,
reminiscent of, and in fact analogous to the one seen in the temperature color
map. It displays two facing regions where the ow converges and two other facing
ones where it diverges.
The four meet at the detected center of the lament.
The constant inow counteracts the central cooling, contributing to support the
enclosing shocked gas.

Figure 3.5: Stylized view of two converging, unidimensional jets bouncing, giving
rise to a quadrupolar vorticity structure.
The upper-right panel of the same gure is the counterpart of the one described
above: it represents the azimuthal velocity eld, the positive (rep. negative) sign
corresponding to the counter-clockwise (resp. clockwise) motion. Outside 90 kpc,
the eld seems to be divided in two and its vanishing contour (also in bright
green) can be considered the locus where gas is equally attracted by two opposing
structures, which appear to be the two pairs of accreting sheets. Inside 90 kpc of
radius, the quadrupolar structure is visible but even clearer inside 30 kpc.
The lower-right panel is the colormap of a composite eld, that of the ratio
of the absolute radial component to the norm of the velocity. Greener colors (i.e.
closer to 0) indicate that the azimuthal component dominates, whereas the more
purple colors (i.e. closer to 1) stand for a radially dominated eld. The two denser
sheets accreting on the lament are noticeable through the fact that their dense
inner slab is characterized by a purely radial inow, while their vicinity is marked
by a gradient from radial (accretion from void to lament) to orthoradial (accre-
tion from voids to the sheets). This latter gradient is stronger further away from
the lament, where its gravitational inuence is lower. The inner quadrupolar
structure has a clearer explanation with this panel: gas ows in from two oppo-
site directions, splashes in the two perpendicular directions and the surrounding
accretion ow imposes that four recirculation vortices form.
This qualitative description perfectly ts with that of Laigle et al. (2015) who
determined that the vorticity in large-scale structure is mostly conned to, and

predominantly aligned with, their laments and that the cross-sections of these
laments are typically partitioned into four quadrants with opposite vorticity sign.
This is not surprising when one considers IGFs to be lower-scale versions of ICFs.
Figure 3.5 presents a stylized view of two sheets meeting a producing that kind of
quadrupolar structure.
Note however that there is a slight asymmetry in the structure. In fact, the
two sheet-like inows that converge in the center are not exactly aligned. This
misalignment, or impact parameter, must result in a non-zero overall angular mo-
mentum. The whole rotation reinforces the vortices of the same sign whereas it
should reduce those of opposite sign. This is shown, in a stylized way, in Fig. 3.6.
From the three panels described above, we can also see that the shock (see
Fig. 3.3, upper-right panel) has an eect on the direction of the post-shock veloci-
ties. Indeed, as already seen, the two main shock fronts are almost nowhere purely
normal to the ow, implying deections of owlines.
The lower-left panel of Fig. 3.4 is a colormap of the axial velocity eld. More
precisely, its sign is positive and corresponds to a fall towards the halo marking the
end of the studied IGF. The eld seems to be divided in two halves, the division
being marked by the two aligned and opposite major sheets: the upper one falls
slowlier (‚àº50 km.s‚àí1) than the lower one (‚àº100 ‚àí15 km.s‚àí1). Close to the shock

fronts, anomalies are found: those strong gradients of vŒ∂ may indicate an already
present vorticity directed parallel to the mapped plane. Is it a hint to a growing
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the void-lament surfaces? Such an instability
and in this precise context is currently researched, for example with the series of
papers beginning with Mandelker et al. (2016).
Let us recall Fig. 3.6. Does it really apply to our lament? To see that, we
performed a radial, mass average of the radial and azimuthal components of the
velocity eld in the transverse plane. Each is dened as follow. For a collection of
N particles, indexed by i and aected with masses, radial positions and velocities
mi, Ri, vii‚â§N, we dene, on a disc of radius r, the mass-averaged radial velocity
‚ü®vr‚ü©(r) and as:
‚ü®vr‚ü©(r) = M(r)‚àí1 X
Ri<r
mivi ¬∑ ur
(3.1)
with M(r) the mass inside the considered disc: M(r) = P
Ri<r mi and ur the
radially directed unit vector.
The lefthand panel shows that the total norm of the mass-averaged velocity,
being a proxy to the kinetic energy, strongly decreases while approaching the
center. Its steeper decline is in the region containing the shock. That energy is
dissipated by viscous forces and the resulting heat then radiated away. The radial
component is everywhere negative, which is a signature of a ow converging at all
scales. This is what allows us to read and interpret this plot from the large to the
91

small scales. Its absolute value follows the same decline as the total norm from
300 kpc down to about 12 kpc. Alike, the azimuthal (or orthoradial) component is
everywhere negative. This implies that at any scale, the ow is globally rotating
clockwise. This conrms the sketch of Fig. 3.6. The righthand panel explains the
drop of radial component at 12 kpc: whatever may be the dissipative eects, the
convergent ow is converted into a rotative ow as we approach the origin.
Even if a radial only study erases all anisotropies, this is still an important
feature of the gas ow: rotation may stabilize the gas against its collapse.
3.5.2
Accretion rates
A good test of the cylindrical approximation, apart from the qualitative appreci-
ation of transverse colormaps, consists in plotting the accretion rates at dierent
radii and as a function of the azimuthal coordinate Œ∏. In a perfect cylindrical
geometry, these plots would be vertical lines. To compute such accretion rates, we
opted for simplicity. Instead of binning angularly, we simply projected, for each
point of the transverse slice, the product of the density by the radial velocity. It
is then a mass ux through a rectangular section whose area is the product of the
slice's width by the pixel width.
Figure 3.8 reports, in logarithmic scales, those quantities. The points are taken
in three rings of radial width 10 kpc and of central radii 150, 90, and 30 kpc. At
150 kpc, the accretion is clearly not cylindrical and we can determine the entry
regions of sheets. A black horizontal line serves as a guide to discriminate between
accretion from voids and from denser structures. The highest peak corresponds to
the companion lament. At 90 kpc, the peaks have dampened and the main ac-
creting sheet dominates. Some blue points are found close to the angle œÄ, meaning
that there is a tiny angular sector of outow. At 30 kpc, two main contributions
to the inow are found, separated by two outows: this is precisely the vortical
quadrupole which is responsible for that. The fact that the angular spans are not
all equal hints at the asymmetric picture of Fig. 3.6.
We can now say that the mass ows inwards are neither invariant under rotation
nor does the cylindrical accretion (from voids) prevailing.
3.5.3
Unsteady, out-of-equilibrium
Radial binning  Only the radial coordinate (i.e. distance to the axis) has been
retained to produce radial proles. The loss of angular information then erases a
lot of the inner lament structuration (eg. the vorticity quadrupole), but aims at
nding a more general, detail-blind model that may subsequently help designing
idealized and toy models.
Choice of a slice  The selected slice is at Œ∂ ‚âà343 kpc (recall that rvir ‚âà60.8 kpc).

r (right) with a horizontal dashed line representing the cosmic value. The grey dot-
ted vertical lines correspond to the illustrative measures of r ‚àà{30, 90, 150} kpc.
In light blue is shown a t of the gas prole by a Plummer prole with parameters
œÅ0 = 1.68 10‚àí27 g.cm‚àí3 and r0 ‚âà24 kpc (see text for details).
Mass and density prole
Fig. 3.9 present the mass and density radial proles of the selected transverse
slice. The radii go below the highest resolution scale of ‚àº110 pc because of the
projection eect of a thin slice tilted from the simulation grid axes. We kept these
bins because, even if it may appear too ambitious, the proles are rather consistent
at these low scales. The histograms are made of 20 bins and have been produced
using 8608 cells (total 8.87 108 M‚äô) of gas and 1706 dark matter particles (total
4.28 109 M‚äô).
As is often the case with polar or cylindrical geometries, the choice of a center
is crucial to the radial proles. For the transverse maps, we used the shrinking
disk method, computed with all masses, gas and DM. Here, since one of our goals
is to compare with self-gravitating models of gaseous laments, we let the code set
the origin based on gas masses only.
94

To produce these proles, interpolation was needed. Like for transverse maps,
the discrepancy between data representations is a challenge. Let us recall that
gas is computed on a grid whose axes are not align with those of the slice and
dark matter is a cloud of mass points. To emulate a lled space, we used the
same technique as for maps: both gas and DM are considered mass points and
we operated a convolution of the resulting distribution with an adaptive gaussian,
bidimensional kernel.
Projecting the distribution of points, indexed by i, on the radial component
only requires a transform of the kernel Œ∫i(r):

where ri and œÉi are the positions and adapted spreadings of the distribution, and
I0 is a modied Bessel function of the rst kind and of order 0.
Such an interpolation allows for an oversampling of the radial bins. But are
the results physical? We compared dierent samplings to understand the eects
of our choices. First, a linear interpolation of the cumulative mass gives very noisy
results, polluted by the dark matter discrete distribution. The fact that DM acts
on the ow through its potential (inverse square law) is not accounted for in this
case. Then, the choice of the kernel size matters. We scaled it, as would seem
natural, with the simulation size of cells: œÉi = Œ±‚àÜxi. The applied coecient Œ±
spreads the densities. Increasing its value obviously smooths the prole but also
changes amplitudes. Above Œ± = 5, the prole does not change anymore. We thus
retained this value.
Of course, some features may be smoothed out but the smoothing factor being
proportional to the resolution length, which in turn is shorter at small radii, the
general behavior of the proles is preserved in logspace representation. The binning
was chosen to be regular in logspace, totalling 1000 bins. It even reinforces the
continuity of the density eld close to the center, since it would have been highly
uctuating due to the small samples in inner shells.
Typical linear mass range  The linear density of our lament at this altitude
give us a typical range of values: from r ‚âà30 kpc to r ‚âà150 kpc, the linear mass
is comprised in the interval 3 107 < Œª/M‚äô.kpc‚àí1 < 109.
Density proles  On the other hand, density seems to fall with a power-law of
slope ‚àº‚àí1 after a central plateau. Gas density itself declines with an exponent
‚àº‚àí2.
The gas density prole itself resembles a Plummer-like prole, with a
plateau below a characteristic radius (here between 3 kpc and 10 kpc) and a
power-law decline. This cylindrical prole is inspired by Ostriker (1964b), where
95

the following law was proposed:
œÅ =
œÅ0

1 +

r
r0
2p/2
(3.3)
where the plateau is set at a value of œÅ0 up to a radius of r0 at which it bends down
with an asymptotic slope p. This was developed from the Lane-Emden equation2
for an isothermal gas in cylindrical geometry, with p = 4.
The idea to t our data with an other exponent is consistent with the fact that
the gas we study is not the sole source of gravitational potential, that it is certainly
not isothermal but maybe evolving from or towards such a case, and that a rotation
parameter, function of the radius, may alter the slope by supporting the gas. The
gas density prole is well tted by such a prole, with œÅ0 = 1.68 10‚àí27 g.cm‚àí3,
r0 = 23.89 kpc and p = 2.070.
Dark matter also seems to follow such a prole, with a much broader plateau.
This is a signature of the impossibility for DM to condense through dissipation.
The lag betwwen the knees of gas and DM explains the decreasing of the baryonic
fraction.
DM-gas decoupling  The baryonic fraction fb helps understanding the impor-
tance of gas physics. When below ‚àº20 kpc of radius, the baryonic fraction is
higher than the cosmic value. At 30 kpc it reaches 50%. Then it decreases toward
the cosmic value, reached around 90 kpc, and nally increases again up to 150
kpc. Above 300 kpc, an other dense structure is met. Clearly this indicates a de-
coupling of gas and dark matter inside the lament. While the gas may condense,
dark matter particle y through the space without collision.
Existence of a core  The existence of a plateau at low radii helps dening a
dense core. But an explanation for this phenomenon still remains to be found. To
understand the fact that the gas has neither completely collapsed due to cooling
nor has it been prevented from collapsing, we must investigate two families of
processesnamely, the connement and the support forces.

Anatomy of longitudinal structures
3.6.1
Longitudinal slices
In the previously shown gures of transverse slices, the natural coordinate system
from the cylindrical geometry would reduce to polar coordinates (r, Œ∏), Œ∂ being
a given constant. Setting the center as the origin and the x-axis a the reference,
angles Œ∏ are completely dened. In each slice, we took a sliver, that is a thin beam
along a given direction Œ∏, from each transverse slice. The sliver data array is built
by linear interpolation of accordingly rotated transverse slices.
We juxtaposed
them to build a longitudinal slice corresponding to Œ∏. The width of the sliver
was set to match the resolution of transverse slices, that is 365 pc. Each sliver is
represented vertically on the longitudinal maps with the width of each transverse
slice, that is 7.14 kpc, and is made of 200 data values, i.e. having a (vertical)
resolution of 2.9 kpc.
Having done so brings one advantage and one disadvantage. Using the centered
transverse slices aligned all those centers in the longitudinal slices, making the
lament appear rather straight. This straightness is an artifact. The advantage
resides in the setting aside of environmental eects that bended the IGF and thus
ensures the visibility of a continuity in longitudinal structures. The drawback is
the exact other side of the coin: the hidden bendings could have proven useful
to trace either a regular pattern (such as an instability possibly originated from
vorticity) or its eects on the internal structure. Such curvature eects are still to
be investigated.
Figures 3.10 and 3.11 show longitudinal slices constructed the way described
above. They count in total four columns, each for a given angle, and three rows,
each for a dierent eld: entropy, temperature, and density. The chosen angles
are irregularly spaced: Œ∏ ‚àà{œÄ/8, œÄ/2, 11œÄ/16, œÄ/33, œÄ/32}. They correspond,
respectively, to the following directions of the exemplied transverse map (the one
at Œ∂ = 343 kpc): that of the most strongly accreting sheet, that crossing the most
shocked medium expanding in the voids, that containing the western converging
entry point, and that which crosses the interesected companion lament.

trace of the previously marked circles in the transverse maps are here highlighted
by green dashed horizontal lines, as if they were generatrices of three coaxial

cylinders.
The simple view of a lament as a tube is found in the longitudinal slice at
Œ∏ = œÄ/2 (right-hand column of Fig. 3.10). The dense core has an almost constant
radius of ‚àº30 kpc and is embedded in a larger tube of shocked gas of radius 60‚àí90
kpc. Two peculiarities are already remarkable: at the halo radius (190 kpc), an
accreting subhalo is encountered. It is still interesting to see that its own gaseous
halo is in direct continuity with the lament gas. Note that its own shocked gas
(over 106 K) would be found in transverse cuts between Œ∂ = 240 kpc and Œ∂ = 300
kpc, where the condensation of the subhalo may not be the cause of this shock
stronger than at higher altitudes. A strongly shocked envelope may develop at the
lament edges with voids and invade the lament: this can explain the presence of
a virial-like shock in laments from other numerical works, with an external origin
and propagating outside-in.
The second noticeable feature is the presence of small condensates along the
axis of the lament. The entropy map is clearer: ve spots of very low entropy are
aligned; they have suciently condensed to strongly contrast with their gaseous
environment. Their apparent radius is close to 30 kpc.
This is reminiscent of, at higher scales, galaxies forming in the cosmic web,
or at much lower scales, stars forming in interstellar laments.
This common
behavior has been studied in Freundlich et al. (2014), where a dispersion relation
is derived to describe this pattern emerging from a gravitational instability in a
self-gravitating, rotating cylinder.
The other angles of longitudinal slices (left-hand column of Fig. 3.10 and
Fig. 3.11) show that what has been learnt from the one transverse slice stud-
ied above is almost generic, all along the lament. Indeed, its environment does
not vary much in structure with the altitude Œ∂. The main accreting sheet is almost
always found at the same angle Œ∏ = œÄ/8, except maybe above Œ∂ = 485 kpc, where
it may be slightly tilted. The lament companion is at about Œ∏ = 11œÄ/16 all along
too, and it merges with our IGF exactly in the accreting subhalo, close to rvir. We
can propose the following hypothesis for the formation of that subhalo: a small
structure had condensed in the IGF and gravitationally attracted the companion,
with the help of the spherical geometry of the potential of the main halo, that nat-
urally tends to make falling objects converge. The entry point where two sheets
merge is also constant in position, at Œ∏ = 33œÄ/32.
3.6.2
Linear masses
Linear masses are of interest, as they are often assumed constant along IGFs and
their value can be considered one of the main input parameters in models (corre-
lated with the central density and exponent of a Plummer prole). Figure 3.12
presents the linear mass Œª of the lament as a function of the altitude Œ∂. The

masses of gas only varies smoothly and the positions of localized condensates are
rather clear. The ground value for the lament is close to 107 M‚äô/kpc of gas inside
the cylinder of radius 30 kpc, and ‚àº108 M‚äô/kpc in cylinders broader than 90 kpc.
At 150 ¬± 60 kpc, the accreting subhalo is visible.
Total matter linear masses show that all condensates have a halo-like structure,
more extended than their gaseous component. The baryonic fraction shows that
above 30 kpc of radius, it is very close to the cosmic value, except in the core
of some condensates and in the subhalo.
Inside 30 kpc of radius, however, fb
oscillates between the cosmic value and 35‚àí45%, indicating that the gas occupies
a dominant role close to the axis. This also means that it experienced a secondary
condensation almost everywhere due to radiative cooling. This noisy behavior may
be explained by the combination of the partly arbitrary nature of the centering in
each slice, and the fact that the density peak may oscillate (for example due to
the vicinity of the four vortices).
A notable feature appears at Œ∂ ‚âà336 kpc. Inside the 30 kpc disc, there seems
to be an aggregate of dark matter which corresponds to a slight local increase in the
gas linear mass. It is also correlated with a relatively low baryonic fraction (more
precisely, it is the cosmic value) compared to the neighboring values.
Finally,
it is seen on the longitudinal maps (Figs. 3.10 and 3.11) that an dense pocket,
analogous to those surrounding other condensates, extends around 320 kpc. This
may be a new condensate in formation.
3.6.3
Characterizing the condensates
The condensates appear at the following altitudes: 336 (in formation?), 414, 500,
614 and, extrapolating the rightmost linear mass increase, 769 kpc. Their relative
spacings is not constant but decreases with Œ∂. This does not enable us to dene a
typical wavelength to compare to the Jeans length or even to models of rotating
cylinders, like in Freundlich et al. (2014). If the intervals depend on Œ∂, and since
they must have formed through a gravitational instability, they must be linked to
quantities involved in such instabilities and that evolve with Œ∂. We can suspect the
accretion rate on the IGF from the sheets and voids, the imparted torque, and the
tidal stretching imposed by the IGF's ending halos. More investigation is needed,
especially through outputs at previous redshifts.
They are best seen by use of transverse slices. Fig. 3.13 shows the entropy
eld of four slices whose altitudes Œ∂ match with the positions of maximal linear
mass enumerated previously. What is striking is that the condensates show two
orders of magnitude in entropy less than their immediate environment.
They
seem to form close to the meeting point of the two sheet-like ows, but all present
low-entropy lobes, extending into one of the four central vortices, and each time a
vortex that has the same sense of rotation as that determined by the impact factor

between the sheets (here the clockwise sense). We hypothesize that either they
formed inside the vortices and migrated, leaving a trace behind; or they formed in
the more central region (which should also host a weak vortex) and the strongest
neighboring vortex sucked its cool gas in. In both cases it must be a region of low
shear and high compression. The rst hypothesis is however more consistent with
the dynamics described in Laigle et al. (2015), as sketched in their gure 11.
An other interesting fact concerns the shape of the condensates. At 414 and 614
kpc, they look elongated in a north-west to south-east direction, which suggests
that they are tridimensional oblate structures whose spin is perpendicular to the
lament's axis. The two other slices show, on the contrary, two shapes closer to
circles, letting us think of either a disk whose spin is parallel to the main axis, or a
sphere cut by the slice. More investigation is needed to see if, like in inter-cluster
laments that carry haloes of masses 1011 < MH < 1013 M‚äô, the spin is correlated
with the shear tensor, as suggested by Libeskind et al. (2012). Laigle et al. (2015)
studied systematically a number of ICFs and derived a correlation between the
spin-lament and the spin-vorticity alignments with the mass of the halo. They
derived probability distributions for the cosine of the relevant angles. The spin and
the lament are misaligned (almost perpendicular) for high masses and it tends
to align descending from 1013 to 1012 M‚äô. From there, where the alignment was
found to be maximal, the angle between the two directions increased again while
descending from 1012 to 1011 M‚äô. Since our condensates barely reach 109 M‚äô, we
can not rely on these correlations to explain our case.
We looked closer at the rst condensate, the one lying at Œ∂ = 414 kpc. Using
a principal component analysis to study it in a geometry closer to spherical, we
could derive radial information. Cumulative mass proles indicated that the mass,
corresponding to a sphere with an average density 200 times higher than the critical
one, is 2 109 M‚äô.
The associated radius is 12 kpc in the PCA space, which
roughly corresponds to the width of a transverse slice. Gas largely dominates its
matter content up to a radius of about 2 kpc and settles in accordance with the
cosmic baryonic fraction at about 3 √ó r200. Note however that, even if the sample
of particles and grid cells is sucient to derive smooth statistics, the numerical
resolution of the central part of the condensate is the highest. This means that no
further renement occurred below about 1 kpc of radius.
An other remarkable feature is seen in the temperature-density distribution.
Although it is clear that gas cools while converging, inside a sphere of a few
kpc, the distribution follows a compression which is asymptotically adibatic while
approaching the center of mass. This is not a physical eect and rather reects
the articial polytropic equation of state applied by Ramses to avoid producing
singularities when conditions are met to form stars. Since we did not turn the star
formation routine on, we only get this signature of a likely star-forming gas in the
104

inner shells. The study of the virialization by comparing pressure, gravitational
and centrifugal forces on spherical shells is therefore compromised by this articial
bias.
If more appropriate parameters are given (higher resolution and star forma-
tion), a fraction of the 109 M‚äôof gas will end up into stars. This would enrich the
IGF gas with metals, critically enhancing its cooling. The scales of masses and
sizes point toward a forming dwarf galaxy. It is noticeable, in the sense that IGF
could therefore be considered as channels for dense gas, but also dwarf galaxies,
directed toward a somehow typical halo.
3.7
Beyond simulation: modelling subgrid features
Numerical simulations are of immeasurable help to researchers, as it is the integra-
tion of a number of coupled dierential equations that would not be easily solved
analytically otherwise. But rst, the cooking depends on the ingredients put in,
that is, a nite set of approximate physical laws relying on an other nite set of
assumptions. May the numerics get close to the boundaries of the assumed ranges
and regimes, it would be highly dangerous to credit the results with full validity.
Second, integrating numerically means using discrete spaces of values. This gen-
erates quantization errors which can propagate and self- or cross-amplify during
a run.
Good codes like Ramses are designed to minimize and keep the errors
controlled. However, apart from numerical errors, discretization also annihilates
some interesting physical phenomena: scales interactions are damped, and scales
outside of the computed scale range are inexistant.
The case of phenomena emerging from small scales are of prime importance
here. It is known that instabilities such as cristallizing fronts in solid physics or
even the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in uid physics, as well as a huge number
of pattern-generating instabilities, nd their structure in self-amplied modes, be-
cause of a local resonance in the phase space close to the instability's onset. When
such modes have a time-frequency (resp. space-frequency) higher than allowed
by the time-step (resp. resolution), the instability either does not grow or only
the boundary modes grow, at an articially slow rate, and notwithstanding the
missing nonlinear interactions with the missing modes.
Falling into this category is the thermal fragmentation, where the cooling of a
uid with a perturbed pressure, density or temperature eld increases the ampli-
tude of perturbations. In the astrophysical plasmas we are interested in, very lo-
calized peaks can appear, for example due to compressive intermittent turbulence,
especially in the supersonic case. But if the small scale outliers are smoothed out
by resolution, no seed can be numerically found to grow cold clouds in a hotter
backgrounds, or at wrong rates and wrong sizes.
105

Talking about turbulence, all many theories3 describing it rely on scaling
paradigms. Seeing it as a cascade of large structures breaking into smaller ones,
like Kolmogorov in 1941, leads to a transfer of energy from a scale to a lower one,
ultimately dissipating it at the lowest ones. This seminal idea has been rened over
and over but the basic principle remained the same. It stood because it provides
a satisfying explanation to the (fractal) structuration of a ow in which energy
is injected at some scale, and ultimately dissipated in the form of heat. More, if
ow structures resonate or, said otherwise, self-organize, energy is transferred to
higher scales, and this sets up a reverse cascade.
In astrophysical ows, the kinetic energy may be injected at the scales charac-
terizing the ow themselves, but also at scales that characterize small-scale phe-
nomena impacting the ow, like hydrodynamical or thermal instabilities. Thus,
missing small scales lead rst to the wrong delay between the energy injection
and its transformation into heat, and second, to the possible absence of turbulent
modes emerging from small-scale instabilities due to reverse cascades.
We adopt here a particular approach. Our aim is to get, from results whose
scales are limited in range, clues to underlying processes owing to subscale physics.
It follows the way modellers design so-called subgrid models, implemented as
subroutines that are run to phenomenologically mimick missing processes, with
the sole knowledge of gridded quantities and their (discrete) derivatives. We will
hence try to extrapolate the plausible subgrid features from our simulation data,
based on a simple analytical criterion for the growth of a multiphase medium,
in Subsection 3.7.1, and with simple scaling arguments for the existence of sub-
resolution turbulence in Subsection 3.7.2.
3.7.1
Multiphase medium?
Out-of-equilibrium dierential cooling
Radiative cooling being more ecient for higher densities and depending on the
ionic composition of the gaz, and thus its temperature (and history), a heteroge-
neously dense, or hot, or pressurized medium may undergo a dierential cooling,
in that some of its compounding regions may cool at dierent rates. When these
discrepancies tend to self-amplify, small perturbations may grow so that, from
slightly heterogeneous, the medium becomes multiphase.
At thermal equilibrium, heating and cooling terms balance each other. Close to
this equilibrium, a phase separation may occur and that case is designated thermal
instability. Among the many works dealing with it, Sharma et al. (2012a) derived
a typical time for the instability to grow under isobaric conditions, depending on

developments of the theory of turbulence.

Propension to become heterogeneous

the inverse of the density contrast. When this time gets to innity, i.e. the growth
rate vanishes, the instability does not occur. This situation is met when
d log Œõ
d log T = 2
(3.4)
where Œõ is the eective cooling power per unit density. The equation itself car-
ries less information than the typical rate, as we lose the quantitative value, but
changing the equal sign into a less-than sign constitutes a qualitative criterion for
the propension to increase density gradients.
Even if the heating provided by metagalactic uxes are present into our nu-
merical computation, it is not sucient to balance the cooling at densities that
characterize the interior of laments. It is therefore inaccurate to look for a pos-
sible thermal instability there. Nevertheless, a self-amplied dierential cooling
may act on relevant timescales. The use of the aforementionned criterion (Eq. 3.4)
is still useful to determine whether a medium is likely to become multiphase. The
quantitative information will then simply come from the cooling time of the gas.
We projected in Fig. 3.14 two elds for the already exemplied transverse slice.
The left-hand panel shows the cooling time of each pixel, while the right-hand one
shows the value of the spread to Eq. 3.4, i.e. 2 ‚àíd log Œõ/d log T, as a proxy for
107

the propension to become heterogeneous. Using the panel of Fig. 3.4 relevant to
the infalling speeds, we can roughly say that the lament falls at ‚àº100 km.s‚àí1.
The slice being at Œ∂ = 343 kpc and the virial radius of the accreting halo being
rhalo = 190 kpc, the approximate time to enter the virial sphere is ‚àº1.5 Gyr.
This indicates that, apart from any other process that may aect the gas, line and
recombination emissions may signicantly cool the gas before the entry everywhere
exept in the shock-heated regions. Looking at the right-hand panel, almost all of
the dense structures such that the lament and its feeding sheets may develop a
multiphase medium. Notice that the densest central peak and a ring bounding
one of the four vortices are however prevented from it.
This sole slice then suces to indicate that except from the dense core, the four
tubular cooler structures are prone to undergo a phase separation before entering
the virial sphere. That statement makes the scenarii for an IGF cold core more
intricate, but the consequences would greatly modify the envisioned accretion of
warm gas through the halo: compression eects, mixing, boundary instabilities,
survivability of the dense matter, would all need to be considered as volume and
mass fractions of each phase.
We refer the reader to Chapter 2 for a broader
discussion about the possibly fragmented nature of IGF gas when entering the
halo.
Toward a subgrid modelling
A look at higher slices reveals that the inside of the vortex tubes are in such a
situation far above the virial radius. But a more rigorous approach needs to include
the local density contrasts. If well represented by a measure of the dispersion of the
density distribution on a given test volume, one could compute a phase separation
time at the scale corresponding to the test volume.
The smaller the scale, the narrower the density dispersion. A subgrid model
could make use of a simple extrapolating scheme to lower scales and virtually
grow separate phases with the associated scales for the cooler, denser blobs and
the associated timescales for their growth. We did not get further on implementing
it, but leave it as a track for future renement of plasma simulations.
There exists a tight connection between the existence of density uctuations
and the turbulent nature of the ow.
The next subsection may then be fully
complementary in understanding the scale-dependence of density uctuations.
3.7.2
Turbulent precursors
Turbulence has often been studied in regimes that are not fully relevant to as-
trophysical situations.
For example, perfectly stationary statistics of the ow
describing quantities only apply on some timescales, i.e. when the injection rate
108

can be considered almost constant and when the cascade is fully developed down
to the viscous scale. In the class of problems we try to address, even the injection
scale itself may vary on a dynamical time.
To track down the possible wrongful absence of turbulent action in simulated
data, one must rst establish the relevant scales. Considering the processes that
give birth to turbulent motions is the key. The rst one we must think of pertains to
the classical view of a multiscale vortical fragmentation, i.e. the so-called solenoidal
turbulence4. It is commonly dened as one component of a turbulent ow, more
precisely the divergence-free part. The other component is termed compressive
turbulence and is dened, as is mathematically natural when decomposing such a
vector eld, as the purely divergent ow, i.e. the rotational-free part.
Solenoidal turbulence arises when rotation of particle cells is locally en-
hanced, that is where shear is strong enough to overcome the dissipative eect
of viscosity and where nonlinear terms (namely the advection term of the Navier-
Stokes equation for momentum, in hydrodynamics) allow for a stimulation of other
spatial frequency modes to grow. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is an example
among other ones. Let us write the rotational of the Navier-Stokes equation rst
divided by the density:

where v is the velocity eld, œâ = ‚àá√ó v is the vorticity eld, œÅ is the density

of all body forces acting on the particle cell, the vector notation is omitted, the
parentheses enclosing an operand-free nabla sign ‚àáis itself an operator.
The
equation applies at any point in space and at any time.
Two terms are able to play the role of a source in Eq. 3.5. These are the rst
and the third of the right-hand side. The third may represent a forcing term, at
which is aected a typical injection scale. The other one is called the baroclinic
term. It measures the baroclinity, i.e. the misalignment of the gradients of density
and pressure.
On the left-hand side of the same equation, lies a term proportional to the
vorticity itself, and to the divergence. Facing the time derivative, and assuming
that the divergence evolves more slowly than the vorticity, it acts as a rst-order
term. Where the ow diverges, it dampens the vorticity, whereas where the ow
converges, it amplies vorticity.
In a Kolmogorov-like development, one would average Eq. 3.5 on a given scale,
exhibiting the dependence of each term on the said scale, using a Fourier expansion

scale ow motions, that is that of liquids and a stratied atmosphere, it concerns incompressible
ows. Hence, the term solenoidal is never used therein,
109

to eliminate dierential operations. The forcing term would only be relevant at
one scale, and the assumption of stationarity of the spectra would be made. The
study of turbulence attributes a great importance to the characterization of the
forcing.
To estimate its scale, we will make use of the two elds previously proved
relevant, the divergence and the rotational of the ow, mapped on the two upper
panels of Fig. 3.15. The units of the colorbar is, strictly speaking, a frequency, or
the inverse of a time. Here that dimension is of no interest and only the contrasts
are to be taken into account. As is not so surprising, regions of strong convergence
(i.e. where the divergence is negative) are found along the shock fronts and where
the two inows meet. On the other hand, the sites of strong shear (i.e. where the
absolute value of the vorticity is high) ar along those two inows, where it slips
against the accreting gas previously shocked.
Notice the sign of the vorticity. Its alternation while turning around the cen-
ter is reminiscent of the quadrupolar vortical structure. It is also in accordance
with those rotative tubes where found. The shearing regions seem to span over
around 90 kpc each. The compressed regions extend over a total length compara-
ble with the perimeter of the 90 kpc circle, which corresponds to the same order
of magnitude as for shear.
Between this estimated injection scale and the maximal resolution scale, there
are a number of scales log10(90 kpc/348 pc) ‚âà2.4. This is clearly low to consider
a cascade which follows scaling laws such as those found in literature, since they
should span a wider range of scales to even develop.
The lower-right panel of Fig. 3.15 shows the logarithmic value of the baroclinic
term. A rst look at the colorbar makes it remarkable that the term varies over
almost nine orders of magnitude. Then we need to add a technical but crucial
point. The baroclinic term as computed here is a local contribution to the vorticity
increase, but on a tighter mesh than the actual simulation output. This is thus
to be considered as a virtual value everywhere the grid is in fact looser. However,
interpolation must have smoothed the elds and thus attenuated the gradients;
what is shown is thus a lower limit. It appears to be much higher in regions where
Fig. 3.4 involves bending of owlines. It lls almost all of the lament inside a
radius of 90 kpc, and, marginally, at the edges of the main accreting sheet.
Finally, the lower-left panel of Fig. 3.15 is the projection of the local Mach
number, in the barycentric frame computed as in the above sections. Shocks are
strong at the lament-void edges (M ‚â≥10) and at the edges of the main accreting
sheet, while they are weak at the entry of other sheets into the lament. Since
the regions where the owlines are bent appear as prone to generate vorticity at
pixel-scale, and since such a bending occur right after a curved shock, the shocks
in the voids, which imply a strong deection, are a source of vorticity in their

respective post-shock regions. The ow is accelerated (see the positive divergence
in the upper-left panel) above the sound speed in two zones inside the lament:
they correspond to the penetration (see upper-left panel of Fig. 3.4) of the highest
accretion channels from the sheets, bordered by the strong shear layers (see the
upper-right panel of Fig. 3.15). They become subsonic again where they meet,
close to the center.
Note that the impact parameter already described and schematically drawn in
Fig. 3.6 will lead to a structuration of vortices of dierent scales. The ow should
then evolves towards a tessellation respecting alternating vorticity signs, in the
same way one would construct a system of gearings. This tessellation is, on a rst
approach, giving rise to a fractal bidimensional ow, i.e. solenoidal turbulence.
The central region of convergence is itself very likely to host a turbulent cascade.
In the assumption of a purely cylindrical geometry, one can trace random mo-
tions through the second moment of its radial distribution.
In the same way
observers infer turbulent motions in molecular clouds, we studied a velocity dis-
persion as a function of the radial size of the domain over which it is computed.
We mass averaged the squared components of the velocity to obtain dispersion
values œÉ(r). For a collection of N particles, indexed by i and aected with masses,
radial positions and velocities mi, Ri, vii‚â§N, we dene, on a disc of radius r, the
mass-averaged velocity vr and the dispersion œÉ(r) as:

but rather obtain a rough one, whose order of magnitude and radial variations can
be interpreted. The corresponding curve in Fig. 3.16 is shown in orange.

indicates a 3/2 power-law. Green dashed vertical lines correspond to the radii of
the concentric circles of transvers slices.
113

As far as the RMS velocity is concerned, no clear power-law appears.
As
expected from its cumulative nature, by denition, it increases with the size of
the disc on which it is measured. At very low radii, r < 3 kpc, the dispersion
is minimal and, even if the rst bins are not very populated, it appears to be at
least 500 km.s‚àí1. About 300 kpc from the center it reaches almost 10,000 km.s‚àí1,
which gives an average slope of ‚àº0.4.
On the other hand, the Reynolds number displays more interesting features.
First, it varies on over an order of magnitude, from a few 105 to almost 107,
indicating a regime that should be far from laminar at small scales. It increases
up to r ‚âà30 kpc, decreases up to r ‚âà90 kpc and increases again up to a little
more than r ‚âà150 kpc. Values above that radius are less reliable since, as seen in
transverse maps, the cylindrical geometry is far from adequate. The condensing
region 30 kpc < r < 90 kpc is also a mixing region and the Reynolds number
increases during convergence. This is in agreement with what we suggested above,
based on color maps of turbulent precursors. One must still be careful: it is not an
indicator of a fully developed turbulence, as two distant points in a disc of given
scale may not interact in a time shorter than other dynamical times.
Regardless of the regime of accretion (supersonic, dilute from voids, or sub-
sonic, dense from sheets), the condensation of gas into a lament must convert a
substantial fraction of the incoming ram pressure into small-scale vortices.
The compressive turbulence, on the other hand, is more dicult to trace
thanks to such maps.
This is unfortunate because this is the component that
may, coupled with the radiative cooling, the most strongly aect the homogeneous
nature of the ow. But we may consider this mode as wave turbulence, i.e. a
structured mixing of acoustic and non-linearly interacting pressure waves. The
only clues we can highlight with these data are the irregularity of the shock fronts
and the irregular back-propagation of pressure waves from the condensation region
(inside 30 kpc).
Two processes might dampen them signicantly: viscosity, of
course, and radiative cooling, whenever it is sucient to decrease pressure at a
higher rate than the waves would increase it.

Main results
Numerical simulations have been used to investigate in detail the gas thermo-
dynamics and kinematics during the formation and evolution of a cosmological
lament. The intergalactic lament mainly forms via gas accretion through in-
tersecting sheets. This accretion is anisotropic and the gas dynamics has many
characteristics similar to that of turbulent ows. Important to this is the genera-
tion of vorticity due converging sheets of gas not being well aligned. The gas in
these converging ows has a cooling time shorter than the dynamical time. Its
114

temperature range is such that the dierential cooling discussed in Chapter 2,
should also apply during the formation of laments. The thermodynamics of the
lament during its formation is, in many ways, analogous to what occurs during
the formation of gaseous halos. This nding substantiates our assumption made
in Chapter 2 that laments have the initial temperature, velocity, and density
structure necessary to seed the growth of inhomogeneities for forming multiphase
accretion streams. Thus even if the resolution of our numerical simulations can
not account for all physical processes relevant to small-scale perturbations, several
clues lead us to think that the gaseous laments may be multiphase and turbulent
before entering the halo.
Interestingly, we found that the closer we moved toward the axis of symmetry
of the lament, the higher the baryonic fraction, indicating strong condensation of
the gas. As part of this investigation, we discovered that dwarf-sized halos with
high density gaseous cores formed in a quasi-regular pattern close to the lament
axis.

4.1
Extending the results
We found during this thesis work, new theoretical properties of lamentary, gaseous
ows accreting into galactic halos. Even in the admittedly over-simplied view of
laments as homogeneous and laminar ows (Chap. 2), a sustained shock close to
the entry into the halo must have several consequences on the post-shock charac-
teristics of the ow. Instead of an isothermal radiative shock which would result
in a subsequent laminar ow of cold gas or a completely disrupted ow of hot gas
mixing with the ambient halo, depending on characteristic cooling and dynamical
timescales, the ow may and likely will be subject to instabilities. Due to its ge-
ometry, the post-shock stream will expand in the halo as it cools. This leads to a
wider range of phenomena, including perhaps the creation of a turbulent biphasic
medium owing into the halo.
When studied with a numerical simulations at redshift 2 (Chap. 3), these la-
ments appear to be very likely to be conned, spinning (vorticity), turbulent and
multiphase. Overall, the collimation of the ows, and any spinning or large-scale
vorticity they may have, may result in laments like those we assumed in our
phenomenological modeling. As we also showed, a virial shock undergone by the
lament would potentially amplify the turbulent multiphased nature of the post
virial shock ow. This amplication may well occur even if there is not a virial
shock but only a compression at around the virial radius of the halo. This is some-
thing that needs to be investigated but suggests that a shock at the boundary is
not the decisive factor in the development of the multiphased turbulent stream.
The implications of our results for our understanding of the characteristics of
gas accretion into galaxies are myriad and important. Having multiphase and tur-
bulent accretion streams under certain conditions must aect the nature of the
circumgalactic medium of galaxies. For example, streams of this nature would
have a higher potential of interaction with even highly collimated galactic out-
ows. Such interaction may further moderate the accretion eciency of cold gas
onto galaxies. Since lamentary accretion is thought to be the major channel of
supplying gas to galaxies necessary for sustaining their growth over cosmic time,
if the gas accretion rate is moderated through the development of multiphased
turbulent streams, then our understanding of the entire balance of inows, star
formation and outows must be incomplete. Thus our results are opening new
insights into how galaxies get their gas and sustain their growth. This is somehow
more complex than what was thought up until recently but moderating accretion
rates does help to alleviate some drawbacks of the ndings about cold ows in
the context of galactic halos as we outlined in Chapter 2.
More eort should be expended to further include a broader range of physi-
cal processes in low resolution, cosmological scale simulations. To reach this goal
of understanding the generation of a turbulent and multiphase medium requires,
118

at least initially, a more detailed, higher resolution modelling of the coupling be-
tween dynamical and thermal energy conversion (dissipation and motion due to
induced local pressure gradients) in idealized simulations.
Such modelling will
provide us with insights into the hot and cold fractions as well as the typical,
randomly distributed, velocities of cold clouds in the post-shock gas and what
physical mechanisms determine things like the fraction of hot and cold post-shock
gas. Moreover, we can generalize the context of halo entry from a sustained planar
shock to any form of compression, especially from the study of the origin of this
sudden compression even in the absence of a high Mach shock. Numerical sim-
ulations with signicantly higher resolution will also help building statistics and
obtaining general relations between the cosmic context and the lamentary ow's
nature.
With this general outline in mind, we now present some details of what is to
be done next.
4.2
Tracks for modelling
We have derived a model based on two methods: a phenomenology derived from
timescale ratios, and estimates from a set of conservation equations. We showed
that a sustained shock in an IGF would be followed, for suciently massive halos,
that the lament's identity may rupture through expansion, thermal fragmen-
tation, turbulent dispersion and (very probably) mixing. Completing this model
with other simple phenomenology, we will be able to narrow down less arbitrary
and more realistic non-dimensional parameters that will lead to a better under-
standing of the eect of a lament's disruption on the gas accretion rate onto
galaxies and on the properties of the circum-galactic medium.
4.2.1
Relating density and velocity uctuations
As seen in our numerical study (Chap. 3), the incoming gas, before its entry in
the halo, is very likely to be already turbulent and multiphase.
Relating this
result to our phenomenological model, we may rewrite our conservation equations
so as to take into account both pre-shock and post-shock fractions (œÜm,w and the
like) and turbulence (œÉ). The rst objective is to nd analytical boundaries in
the parameter space which delimit regimes where the shock is expected either to
amplify or dampen the multiphase and turbulent nature of the ow.
The next step consists of assuming that the uctuations in the velocity eld,
accounting for the gas turbulence, and those of the density eld, accounting, among
other things, for the density dispersion of the hot component, are tightly connected.
This is explained by our stating the following hypotheses that:
119

1. the condensation of a warm phase induces turbulent motions,
2. the compressible component of turbulence stimulates the phase separation
(these rst two items are in fact interrelated),
3. the solenoidal component of turbulence mitigates, on average, the density
peaks,
4. the turbulent dissipation heats up the gas,
5. the radiative cooling always acts as the gas evolves with time with the rate
depending on temperature and density,
6. the processes 1 to 5 balance each other, resulting in a quasi-static evolution.
We will now focus on the numerical integrator described in ¬ü2.5.8 and the
modications implied by these new hypotheses. In that new simple case, at each
timestep, the density distribution, i.e, the hot post-shock component has a density
dispersion, in log, Œ¥, which can be used to derive the turbulent velocity dispersion
(œÉ ‚àùMrms
‚àö
T) for the next timestep. How are they be related?
Relating Œ¥ and Mrms
If we assume that the initial dispersion of densities is related to the trans- or
supersonic turbulence, we can try to apply the density varianceturbulent Mach
number relation
Œ¥ ‚âàlog(1 + (bMrms)2)
(4.1)
with b a constant of order unity and Mrms the root-mean-squared Mach number
(eg. Passot & V√°zquez-Semadeni, 1998; Audit & Hennebelle, 2010; Price et al.,
2011; Molina et al., 2012).
This relation had been empirically found and theoretically derived for isother-
mal, supersonic cases, but we will use it as an approximately appropriate guess for
Mrms = œÉps/cps. If the compressive modes dampen rapidly, we can take a ducial
value of b = 1/3, while a mix of compressive and solenoidal modes yields b ‚âà1/2
(see previous references).
First approach: turbulent decay only
In a rst approach, we can consider that the shock front perturbations are the
driver and that the ensuing ow hosts a spontaneously decaying turbulence. Thus,
hypothesis 1 would not apply and the turbulent Mach number at each timestep
would only result from the dissipation of previous timesteps. Only the initial RMS
Mach number is derived from the variance in the initial density.
120

The turbulent dissipation rate is the inverse of its characteristic time, which
is the ratio of the turbulent specic energy (œÉ2) to the specic dissipation power
(nœÉ3/Ldissip) at any given time. This can be expressed as:
tdissip = Ldissip
œÉ
(4.2)
where Ldissip is a typical dissipation length, usually taken as the typical injection
length scale. However, doing so is justied in the case of a homogeneously driven
turbulence.
The time evolution of œÉ is given by:
d log(œÉ) =
dt
2tdissip
(4.3)
and at each timestep we may calculate the RMS Mach number by dividing œÉ by
the dominant sound speed in the hot medium.
Turbulent motions dissipate into heat at a rate given by the inverse of its
characteristic time, dened by the ratio of the thermal specic energy to the specic
dissipation power:
theat = LdissipkBT
nœÉ3
(4.4)
Since turbulent dissipation is a heating source, a new characteristic time may be
constructed to reect the thermal evolution:
ttherm =
 1
theat
‚àí
1
tcool
‚àí1
(4.5)
relevant for each particle, and varying with time. When it is negative, cooling
prevails, whereas when positive, heating dominates. The time evolution of the
thermal specic energy is now:
d log(e) =
dt
ttherm
(4.6)
Eqs. 4.3 and 4.6 are then implemented into their discretized versions in the
way Eqs. 2.38 and 2.39 were written.
I already attempted such an implementation and it led, in eect, to long-term
saturation of the mass fraction in some cases, where the turbulence is slightly
subsonic. No report of this work is currently in progress and so no conclusions can
be provided mostly because of the lack of a systematic study of the eect of the
two fundamental parameters: b, and Ldissip.
121

4.2.2
Even further
The shock transition itself could be more accurately modelled. Breaking the as-
sumption that the shock is planar and stationary should inform us about the
transition parameter Œ∑ and about the shock stability itself. First, we would study
oblique- symmetric, concave, convex and perturbed shocks and derive turbulent
amplitudes by staying close to the derivation of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability
(Richtmyer, 1960; Meshkov, 1969). The origin of the shock itself should be inves-
tigated, either by means of an analytical model of an inward-propagating strong
compression and with a numerical simulation of an idealized lament.
We also discussed exploring the parameter space of galaxy mass, redshift, halo
environment, etc on the stability of the shock. Doing so, it is possible to nd
regions wherein our phenomenological modeling is invalid. This constitutes an
interesting and somehow general way of constraining the relevance of our combi-
nation of hypotheses. Indeed, crossing some bounding surfaces of the parameter
space questions the assumption of stationarity. If the ow is not stationary, would
it result in losing or reinforcing the necessary lower supporting forces for sustain-
ing the virial shock? In the rst case, the disruption of the lamentary warm ow
would vanish, the same way as with the unstable shock from Dekel & Birnboim
(2006), but for more complex reasons. In the second case, that we could call over-
stability, it would result in the disappearance of the collimated ow at the edge
of the halo. An even more subtle but perhaps more realistic possibility is that
the shock oscillates, alternating between under- and over-stable phases, due to
the halo pressure evolving as the ow penetrates deeper. Determining a stability
criterion for a fully 3-dimensional shock is another avenue we must consider.
There are also interesting avenues through which the accretion eciency onto
the galaxy proper may also be estimated. A rst attempt was made to model
the emission of clouds from a single source point for various limiting solid angles
and various dispersion of a Maxwellian distribution of velocities, free-falling into
an NFW potential. The amount of clouds reaching the sphere of radius 10%
of the virial sphere (representing the galaxy) is always around 20% of the initial
mass after one dynamical time, and this is only weakly aected by the initial
average angular momentum. Adding a distribution of sizes and masses, as well
as corresponding probabilities of collision, evaporation or stripping (eg. Maller &
Bullock, 2004) would strongly improve may predictions for the mass acquisition
rate of warm gas by the galaxy and has the gas balance in galaxies.
122

4.3
New avenues for simulations
While modelling involves a renement and an increase in the number of hypotheses,
the numerical simulation used in Chap. 3 relies only on a small set of rst principles
(or approximations), which provides a complementary avenue for understanding
various phenomena of accretion ows. Tuning parameters in numerical simulations
may help alleviate some doubts about what we modelled, while the model will
help in deciding what is to be numerically investigated. A lot can be made with
this work as a starting point.
We now try to orient ourselves towards further
developments that may be important for our developing understanding of the
formation of laments and accretion ows.
4.3.1
Further numerical processing
Finding scalings
An eort must be made to automate the detection and the
tracing of intergalactic laments in our data set. This can be done with the help
of numerical tools such as DisPerSe (see eg. Sousbie et al. (2011); Sousbie (2011)).
By building a catalogue of laments, characterized by the masses of the halos
they ow into, we could systematically extract quantitative properties such as
their average Plummer exponents, their average linear density of condensates as
well as their average wavelength, their ability to thermally fragment and the level
of expected turbulence they have. Such a halo-mass dependent characterization
would not only reveal a possibly scale-invariant physics, but would also serve as
input into more robust modelling on cosmological scales.
Time evolution
A logical development would benet from additional outputs
from simulations, such as more redshifts, to determine whether our ndings are still
valid at higher redshifts, when the lamentary accretion onto galaxies is thought to
be most vigorous for all halo masses. The study of earlier snapshots would allow
for a deeper insight on dynamics and mass growth of laments, their stability
and their ability to condensate warm gas as a function of time, and why, if it is
the case, they progressively lose their dominate role of supplying gas relative to
mergers after redshift 1.
4.3.2
Further numerical experiments
Increasing resolution
The next step may appear obvious. It consists in increas-
ing the resolution of the simulation. The ner the grid, the closer we would get to
reveal fragmented elds such as velocity of turbulence and density/temperature for
a multiphase medium. This will also allow us to determine more accurate radial
proles, leading to a better understanding of the stability of laments and their
123

detailed large scale density distribution. Adaptive mesh renement, the rening
condition needs to be changed to understand specic aspects of the characteristics
of laments. For example, if boundaries of the laments are to be understood,
rening on density gradients, instead of density itself, is of the essence. On the
other hand, if rotational eects are to be investigated, such as for understanding
the development of turbulence in ows, rening on regions of higher vorticity is
the pertinent choice (see Kornreich and Scalo for example).
Running ner physical models
Numerous phenomena have been omitted in
our zoom-in simulation. An obvious one is the formation of stars in the lament.
Considered time-consuming and possibly without consequence on high-redshift l-
aments, we did not let the gas trigger small scale condensations which may form
into star clusters. Apart for articially pressurizing the densest structures, it has
the disadvantage of not allowing the pre-enrichment the intergalactic medium
with metals. And even if the laments penetrate the halo gas with enough mo-
mentum to keep their bulk free from metals, a boundary mixing layer could well
form a cooler sheath resulting in an increased warm mass fraction. And if stars
may form in some substructures of the laments, they could also self-enriched
with metals, which would be a game-changer for galactic models.
The second missing ingredient that could aect laments is the magnetic eld.
With an MHD simulation, plasmas in IGFs would experience weaker shocks and
the vorticity structures would interact with the magnetic eld so as to amplify
it. The radiative cooling would also be altered, for ion collisions would occur at
dierent rates and energies.
4.3.3
Deriving observational constraints
With the use of spatial and thermodynamic conditions, assuming for example a
collisional equilibrium, spectra of the gas radiative emission could be computed so
as to obtain constraints on observations aiming at nding intergalactic laments.
In particular, emissions would be rather dierent if the medium is homogeneous or
heterogeneous. In the latter case, small, dense, cold clouds would represent a high
mass fraction but a low volume-lling factor, thus diluting their spectral signature,
whereas the highly volume-lling, hot ambient gas would not emit much because
of its very low density and low eciency of emission. Not only the spectral lines
would be mixed in the case of a heterogeneous medium, but their intensity would
be lower.
