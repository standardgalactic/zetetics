The Springer Series in Evolutionary Psychology is the first series of volumes 
dedicated to this increasingly important discipline within psychology. The series 
will reflect the multidisciplinary nature of this field encompassing evolutionary 
theory, biology, cognitive psychology, anthropology, economics, computer science, 
and paleoarchaeology. It will explore the underlying psychological mechanisms, 
and information processing systems housed in the brain as well as the various 
triggers for their activation. Its scientific assumptions rest on the concept that 
evolution is the only known causal process capable of creating complex organic 
mechanisms as are exhibited in human and animal life. Further, it seeks to show 
how information processing is adaptively influenced by input from the environment. 
Overall, the series will address the range of functionally specialized evolved 
mechanisms, mediated by contextual circumstances, that become combined and 
integrated to produce manifest behavior. The Series will address key areas of 
research within the field, including sexual behavior; conflict between the sexes; 
parenting; kinship; cooperation and altruism; aggression; warfare; and status and 
prestige. A premier resource in evolutionary psychology for researchers, academics 
and students, this series will provide the field continuing and comprehensive 
coverage of this high profile area.

Infancy Through the Lens of Evolutionary 
Developmental Science
David F. Bjorklund and Sybil L. Hart
Natural selection has acted to shape the evolution of human form and function at all 
stages of the lifespan, but not necessarily equally. Natural selection has operated 
more strongly at the earlier stages of life than the latter. Although it is adults who 
must make a living in an often-hostile environment and who do the reproducing 
vital for continuation of the species, they must first survive infancy, childhood, and 
adolescence before making it to full maturity. Infancy, in particular, can be thought 
of as the crucible of natural selection, with approximately a quarter of ancestral 
infants failing to see their first birthdays (Volk & Atkinson, 2013; McDowell & 
Volk, Chap. 5, this volume).
Life is perilous for all infant mammals to varying degrees, and mammal infants 
(along with their parents, mostly their mothers) have evolved adaptations to increase 
their chances of survival. Human babies, however, remain immature and dependent 
on their mothers longer than other primates, and this necessitated extraordinary 
adjustments to the typical primate developmental pattern for Homo sapiens infants 
to stay alive and thrive. Compared to their chimpanzees cousins, human infants are 
slower to attain physical developmental milestones such as walking, require more 
effort on the part of their mothers for care (human infants cannot cling to their moth-
ers, but rather must be carried by their mothers), and are born “early” compared to 
other primates (with respect to proportion of eventual brain size), with the result that 
their brains grow rapidly while experiencing a richer sensory and social environ-
ment than they would have had they followed the typical primate developmental 
course (e.g., Portman, 1990/1944; see Bjorklund, Chap. 2; DeSilva, Chap. 4; Locke

& Bogin, Chap. 6, this volume). Although mammals all begin life as infants, the 
evolved nature of human infancy is in some ways substantially different from that 
of other mammals, beginning with a developmental process that transformed Homo 
sapiens’ social and cognitive abilities to be qualitatively (or at least massively quan-
titatively) different than those of all other species.
1.1  What Evolved and What Develops?
Central to any evolutionary perspective is that individuals with features that pro-
mote survival in local environments pass on those features to their offspring, and 
that, over many generations and in some contexts, changes at a species level can 
occur. Thus, our ancestors evolved, but, during their lifetimes, they each developed 
(de Beer, 1958). In fact, because organisms display a high level of plasticity (ability 
to change) early in development, it was modifications in patterns of development in 
our forechildren that provided the variation upon which natural selection operated. 
According to West-Eberhard (2003, p. 139): “Adaptive evolution [improvement in a 
species due to selection] is a two-step process: first the generation of variation by 
development, then the screening of that variation by selection.”
1.1.1  The Emergence of Adaptations
Contemporary evolutionary developmental scientists assume that development is a 
natural consequence of species-typical behavior emerging in a species-typical envi-
ronment that evolved to solve problems associated with survival for one’s ancestors. 
What, then evolved? The short answer is adaptations, alterations in the structure or 
function of an organism that provided a survival or reproductive benefit. In some 
cases, adaptations involved changes in physical morphology, such as a bigger brain 
or enhanced fine-motor coordination. However, both brains and fine-motor coordi-
nation go through lengthy development before they can be used to solve physically 
complex problems or to use tools efficiently. Other adaptations are related to behav-
ior, emotions, or cognition – psychological adaptations – that also promoted sur-
vival. However, sophisticated, adult-level behavior or cognitive abilities do not arise 
fully formed in adults but emerge from skeletal psychological mechanisms through 
interaction with the environment over the course of development. From this per-
spective, adaptations not only evolved but also develop (Bjorklund, 2015). This is 
reflected by the field of evolutionary developmental psychology, defined as “the 
study of the genetic and ecological mechanisms that govern the development of 
social and cognitive competencies common to all human beings and the epigenetic 
(gene-environment interactions) processes that adapt these competencies to local 
conditions” (Geary & Bjorklund, 2000, p. 57).
D. F. Bjorklund and S. L. Hart

With respect to psychological adaptations, evolutionary developmental scientists 
have proposed that infants and young children are biologically prepared to develop 
a suite of social and cognitive skills that, in interaction with their cultural environ-
ment, produce a unique type of human cognition and sociality. More specifically, 
infants are born with sets of low-level perceptual or cognitive “primitives” related to 
a variety of domains, such as understanding the physical world (e.g., objects fall 
when not supported), processing numbers (“more” vs. “less” relations), and under-
standing the biological and social world. Concepts such as core knowledge (e.g., 
Spelker & Kinzler, 2007), starting-state nativism (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1997), skel-
etal competencies (Geary, 1995), and evolved probabilistic cognitive mechanisms 
(Bjorklund et al., 2007) have been proposed to capture the idea that infants are born 
with perceptual or cognitive biases that prompt them to pay attention to or process 
information in some domains more effectively than others. Abilities associated with 
these domains (e.g., tool use or social relations) become more sophisticated as they 
are fleshed out over ontogeny through exploration, play, and social interaction. 
Thus, what evolved are not fully articulated abilities, but low-level mechanisms that 
emerge in a species-typical way when infants and children are exposed to a species-­
typical environment.
As an example of how adaptations develop, consider vision. All typically devel-
oping mammals are born with a portion of their cortex devoted to vision. However, 
research with nonhuman animals clearly shows that the visual systems of animals 
reared in species-atypical conditions (e.g., in darkness or seeing only vertical lines) 
develop in atypical ways (Crabtree & Riesen, 1979; Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). 
Similarly, human babies born with cataracts develop normal vision if cataracts are 
removed within the first 2 or 3 months of life; vision is impaired, however, when 
cataracts are not removed until later in development (Le Grand et al., 2001; Maurer 
et al., 2007; see Maurer & Lewis, 2013, for a review). Visual experience is needed 
for neurons in the visual cortex to become properly organized, permitting normal 
“sight.”
For developmentally typical infants, vision is limited at birth, yet even newborns 
will orient to what is perhaps the most important visual stimuli in their lives, faces 
(particularly of their mothers). For example, neonates attend to face-like stimuli 
(e.g., Mondloch et al., 1999); are especially attentive to eyes open and gazing at 
them (e.g., Farroni et al., 2002); and look longer at right-side-up versus inverted 
faces, but only when they can see the eyes (Gava et al., 2008). Yet, such early orien-
tation seems not to be to faces, per se, but to perceptual features associated with 
faces. For instance, young infants are attentive to movement (Haith, 1966), areas of 
high contrast, such as eyes (Salapatek & Kessen, 1966), curvilinear (versus linear) 
stimuli (Ruff & Birch, 1974), vertically symmetrical stimuli (i.e., the right and left 
sides of a stimulus are alike) (e.g., Griffey & Little, 2014), and to “top-heavy” stim-
uli (i.e., up-down asymmetry, such as two eyes over one mouth) (Macchi Cassia 
et al., 2004). With experience, infants become increasingly skilled at identifying and 
processing faces. For example, 3-month-old babies are able to discriminate equally 
well among faces of different species (e.g., among monkeys and among humans), 
among faces of both men and women, and among faces of people from different 
1  Infancy Through the Lens of Evolutionary Developmental Science

races. However, by 9 months of age infants’ abilities to tell the difference between 
faces from nonhuman species (e.g., monkeys; Pascalis et al., 2002) and races other 
than their own (e.g., Asian faces for Caucasian infants; Kelly et al., 2009) decline, 
while improving in their ability to discriminate among faces from their own race 
(e.g., Kelly et al., 2009; Quinn et al., 2002), a phenomenon called perceptual nar-
rowing (Lewkowicz, 2014; Werker & Tees, 1984). This pattern makes good adap-
tive sense, in that infants should become skilled at differentiating among types of 
faces that they see often in their lives, with the ability to discriminate among types 
of faces they rarely or never see (e.g., different species, different races) being less 
important. This pattern is not inevitable, however. If children receive species-­
atypical experiences (e.g., frequently seeing monkey faces, [Pascalis et al., 2005], 
faces from other races [Anzures et al., 2012; Tham et al., 2017], or if their fathers 
are their primary caregivers [Quinn et al., 2002]), they retain the ability to discrimi-
nate efficiently among different members of these groups.
Although infants seem to begin life with a bias to attend to and process faces, this 
does not seem to involve complex “instincts” for faces, but rather a bias to attend to 
a suite of low-level perceptual features that faces happen to possess (movement, 
curvilinearity, top-heavy asymmetry) along with some processing biases (e.g., effi-
cient processing of vertically symmetrical stimuli; better ability to discriminate 
among top-heavy than bottom-heavy stimuli). Thus, even for so basic a capacity as 
vision and infants’ abilities to discriminate among critically important visual stimuli 
(i.e., faces), natural selection has achieved adaptive end states through the interac-
tion of inherited low-level perceptual and cognitive dispositions interacting with a 
(usually) species-typical environment. Neural structures and functions emerge as a 
result of dynamic interactions between brain systems and “expected” environments 
(i.e., environments that most members of a species can expect to experience, given 
the natural history of the species) to produce species-typical patterns of develop-
ment. Infants have enough plasticity, however, to modify their developmental trajec-
tory to be consistent with local environments (e.g., seeing faces from one’s own 
racial group), although substantial deviations from a species-typical environment 
can interfere with the “choreographed dance between gene-influenced neural matu-
ration and perceptual experience,” resulting is species-atypical outcomes (Bjorklund 
et al., 2007, p. 13).
1.1.2  Deferred Adaptations
The ability to process faces efficiently emerges from the interaction of a species-­
typical nervous system and a species-typical environment. Moreover, these emer-
gent abilities serve as the basis of more sophisticated processing later in development. 
These can be thought of as deferred adaptations, serving to adapt individuals not 
only to their immediate environment, but also to future ones.
D. F. Bjorklund and S. L. Hart

7
Perhaps the most important suite of deferred adaptations in infancy are related to 
social cognition. For example, when adults have conversations with babies, they 
often talk about and point out things to their young conversation partners, and 
beginning about 9 months of age infants start to understand what the adults are talk-
ing about, looking, for example, at the object the adult is pointing to and possibly 
expressing some emotion while doing so (Carpenter et  al., 1998; Tomasello & 
Carpenter, 2007). Although such shared (or joint) attention may not appear to reflect 
a major cognitive milestone, it represents a significant change in how infants under-
stand their social world and serves as the foundation for all subsequent higher-order 
forms of social cognition (e.g., theory of mind, see Buttelmann, Chap. 13, this vol-
ume). Infants are now treating others as intentional agents, people who do things 
intentionally, or “on purpose.” Shared attention increases over the second year of 
life. Twelve- and 18-month-old infants will point to objects to direct adults’ atten-
tion to something they are searching for, will point to adults to inform them about 
things the adults don’t know, will use others’ eye gaze as a cue to direct their own 
attention (Brooks & Meltzoff, 2002; Liszkowski et al., 2006, 2007), and will engage 
in social referencing, using a parent’s facial expression, gesture, or tone of voice to 
interpret an ambiguous situation, such as falling off a chair (should I cry or not?) 
(Hornik et al., 1987; Vaish & Striano, 2004). This developmental pattern is found 
universally, even in cultures in which adults direct little attention to young infants 
(Callaghan et al., 2011).
Other research has shown that infants between the ages of 12 and 14 months 
show “egocentric empathic distress,” responding to another’s distress as if they 
themselves were in distress (Hoffman, 2000), display sympathy for the distress of 
others in the first year of life (Davidov et al., 2020), and toddlers in a wide range of 
cultures show greater happiness giving away treats than receiving treats (Aknin 
et al., 2015). Each of these behaviors is likely to promote future prosocial behavior 
with conspecifics (see Vaish & Grossmann, Chap. 16, this volume).
Tomasello (2019) has proposed that children develop what he calls collective 
intentionality and the ability to establish a group-minded “we” with other people 
beginning around the age of 3, reflected by, among other things, in-group favorit-
ism, conformity to social norms, and collaboration to achieve a joint goal. Yet, fore-
runners of these abilities can be found in infancy. For example, 9-month-olds 
associate faces from their own race with happy music and other-race faces with sad 
music (Xiao et al., 2018), and 11- and 14-month-old infants are more likely to imi-
tate the gestures of a native speaker than a foreign speaker (with associated differ-
ences in brain activity) (Buttelmann et al., 2013; de Klerk et al., 2019). Slightly 
older toddlers (18- to 20-months) associate sex-stereotypic toys with the “appropri-
ate” gender (for instance, dolls for girls; toy cars and trucks for boys), and 2-year-­
olds selectively imitate same-sex stereotypic behavior (for example, caring for a 
baby for girls; building a house for boys) (Bauer, 1993; Martin et al., 2002). With 
respect to collaboration, although it is not until 3 years of age that children who 
work together to attain a goal will share treats equally, again the roots of cooperative

behavior can be found in infancy. For instance, 18-month-olds will coordinate their 
actions with an adult to play a social game and protest when the adult suddenly 
stops, even when they can continue the game without the help of the adult, demon-
strating that it is the social interaction that they are trying to reinstate not merely the 
completion of the game (Warneken et al., 2006, 2012). Thus, infants and toddlers 
seem to have the cognitive capacity to make in-group versus out-group distinctions 
early, as well as the foundation for collaboration, setting the stage for more sophis-
ticated social-cognitive processes.
1.1.3  Ontogenetic Adaptations
In contrast to deferred adaptations, other adaptations seem not to develop into full-­
blown adult abilities, but rather serve to adapt infants to their current environment 
and disappear when they are no longer needed. These are referred to as ontogenetic 
adaptations (Bjorklund, 1997, 2015; Oppenheim, 1981). Consider, for example, the 
umbilical cord. It serves a universal function for all members of the species, supply-
ing oxygen and nutrition to a fetus, but is useless after birth, as an entirely new set 
of physiological systems become operative. After birth, babies possess a suite of 
reflexes, some of which, such as the sucking reflex, are critical for nursing. With 
maturation of the nervous systems, control is shifted from subcortical to cortical 
brain areas, and infants no longer need a reflex to facilitate nursing, as they gain 
increasing intentional control over their behavior.
Ontogenetic adaptations can occur in the behavioral and psychological realms as 
well. For example, one candidate for a psychological ontogenetic adaptation is neo-
natal imitation. Under some conditions, newborns will match the facial gestures 
(e.g., tongue protrusion or lip pursing) of an adult model (e.g., Meltzoff & Moore, 
1977). More recent research has suggested that babies may not actually match the 
facial gesture they see modeled, but nonetheless make some facial response to the 
model, even if it is not the one demonstrated (Oostenbroek et al., 2016; Redshaw 
et al., 2019). Meltzoff and Moore (1977) originally proposed that neonatal imitation 
reflects a form of social learning, although subsequent research questioned this 
interpretation. An alternative perspective is that neonatal imitation serves to moti-
vate caretakers to interact with an infant during a time when babies cannot control 
their own behavior (Bjorklund, 1987, 2018). Consistent with this interpretation is 
research that showed that newborns who displayed high levels of neonatal imitation 
demonstrated higher levels of social interactions with their mothers three months 
later than newborns who showed lower levels of neonatal imitation (Heimann, 
1989), and that neonatal imitation disappears by about 2 months of age when higher-­
cortical brain areas are able to influence infants’ intentional actions (see Periss & 
Bjorklund, 2011).

1.1.4  Infant Adaptations as Emergent Properties
Infants are born with perceptual and cognitive biases to attend to and process some 
information more readily than others. Because of infants’ high degree of plasticity, 
these biases can result in a range of outcomes, dependent on an infant’s specific 
experiences; however, most will result in species-typical behavior assuming expo-
sure to a species-typical environment. According to Bjorklund (2015, p. 30), “evo-
lutionary adaptations are not so much inherited as they are emergent properties, 
arising from early developing perceptual and cognitive biases, in interaction with 
species-typical environments, to produce individuals that are adapted to their local 
environment.”
1.2  Who Is an Infant?
Most researchers who study human infants specify who exactly they are talking 
about, i.e., who is an infant. The problem is, they often differ in their definition.
Perhaps the most common definition of infancy, for both scholars and laypeople 
alike, is children in their first year of postnatal life. There is good justification for 
identifying infancy as the time between birth and 12 months, for this is a period in 
which humans show perhaps the greatest amount of motor, social, and cognitive 
change than any other time in life. Babies are born with limited control over their 
physical actions, but over the course of the first year most infants can sit unsup-
ported, crawl, and even walk. Although babies in their first weeks of life may be 
oriented toward social stimuli (e.g., attending to biological motion and face-like 
stimuli), over the course of the first year the social lives of infants change drasti-
cally, most importantly in forming attachments to their caregivers (see Locke & 
Bogin, Chap. 6; Hart, Chap.7; Hrdy & Burkhart, Chap. 8; Salmon & Hehman, 
Chap. 9; Henry & Morelli, Chap. 10; Simpson & Jaeger, Chap. 11, all in this vol-
ume). Changes may be equally substantial in cognition. For example, Piaget 
described infant cognition over the first year of life as a gradual change in represen-
tation and problem-solving, with infants between 8 and 12 months showing the first 
signs of goal-directed behavior (i.e., need preceding action, coordination of second-
ary circular reactions). As discussed earlier in this chapter, this corresponds to the 
time when infants first engage in shared attention, understanding that they and 
another person can share a single experience (e.g., baby and mother both seeing a 
third object). Coupled with this is infants seeing others as intentional agents, who 
cause things to happen, and the ability to take the perspective of other people (e.g., 
Tomasello, 2019). Although shared attention might seem to be a minor intellectual 
accomplishment, it serves as the basis for all subsequent social-cognitive abilities 
(see Buttelmann, Chap. 13; Hart, Chap. 15, both in this volume).
Other researchers recognize the continuity of development between the first and 
second years of life and consider what others would call toddlerhood as part of 
1  Infancy Through the Lens of Evolutionary Developmental Science

infancy, extending to 18–24 months. Major changes during this time include, from 
a Piagetian perspective, the transition from a mostly sensorimotor to symbolic form 
of representation, with perhaps the onset of language being the most obvious change 
(see Doi & Masataka, Chap. 12, this volume). Rate of brain development also slows 
down beginning around 18 months (Marchetto et  al., 2019; see Wilder & 
Semendeferi, Chap. 3, this volume). Extending infancy to well into the second year 
of life is in keeping with the origin of the word, infans, from the Latin meaning 
“unable to speak” or “speechless.”
For others still, especially comparative biologists and psychologists, infancy 
extends to weaning, 2.5–3 years of age in hunter-gatherers (see Hart, Chap. 15, this 
volume). From this perspective, infancy encompasses the period that is often 
referred to as toddlerhood and is one of three life stages of all mammals. The other 
two stages include the juvenile period, the time following weaning to sexual matu-
rity (called middle childhood by psychologists and educators) and adulthood. 
(Bogin [2021] has suggested that humans have added two additional stages, not 
found in other mammals, childhood, the 3 or 4 years following weaning when chil-
dren are no longer nursing but still require substantial support from adults, and 
adolescence, the several-year period of rapid growth and the onset of sexual matu-
rity.) Following this definition, attainment of developmental milestones in humans 
can be directly compared with those of other animals, particularly primates. For 
example, although human babies’ motor development lags that of chimpanzees, 
they are weaned a year or two earlier than chimpanzees, reducing the inter-birth 
interval in humans relative to chimps (Bründl et al., 2020; see DeSilva, Chap. 4; 
Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6, this volume). Some major changes in cognition are also 
seen beginning around 3 years of age; for example, as mentioned earlier in this 
chapter, Tomasello (2019) proposed that beginning around 3 years children start to 
form a group-minded “we” with other people (collective intentionality), resulting in 
the identification of in- and out-group members, social norms, and the ability to col-
laborate effectively.
It should not be surprising that each of these definitions of “who is an infant” can 
be found, implicitly or explicitly, in the chapters in this volume, given the variety of 
disciplines represented by the contributors. Authors of the chapters self-identify as 
coming from the fields of developmental psychology, evolutionary psychology, bio-
logical psychology, primatology, paleoanthropology, biological anthropology, neu-
roscience, linguistics, and human biology. Despite differences in who, exactly, is 
considered an infant, each discipline and author shares the view that infancy is a 
unique and important time in human ontogeny.
1.3  Overview of the Book
The first part of this volume devotes attention to some of the key physical param-
eters that governed processes which played a role in shaping the modern human 
infant’s mind. In his chapter on Human Evolution and the Neotenous Infant, 
D. F. Bjorklund and S. L. Hart

David F. Bjorklund discusses genetic-based differences in the timing and rates of 
attaining developmental milestones along the pathway toward physical and psycho-
logical maturity. He explains how different patterns of change enhanced neural plas-
ticity that expanded capacities for cognitive and social functioning, and adaptations 
that fostered survival. In Chap. 3, Linnea Wilder and Katerina Semendeferi discuss 
modifications in infant brain development that arose following the split from the last 
common ancestor of hominins. The authors show how advances in Homo sapiens’ 
brain function were augmented by accelerated rate of growth that occurred prena-
tally as well as prolonged development that took place postnatally. The next chapter, 
Childbirth and Infant Care in Early Human Ancestors: What the Bones Tell Us by 
Jeremy DeSilva, explores circumstances that drove major evolutionary shifts in the 
ways that human birth and infant care were carried out. Drawing on the human fos-
sil record and findings on comparative skeletal anatomy, he illuminates changes that 
came about with upright posture, bipedalism, and the demands of transporting 
infants. The final chapter in this part, by Hannah McDowell and Anthony Volk, 
focuses on the first year of life as a period that was unique for being characterized 
by exceptionally by high rates of mortality. The authors present data on common 
causes of infant mortality and discuss implications of the high infant mortality rate 
in terms of its function as a filter that was responsible for potent evolutionary selec-
tive pressures.
Part II addresses various social attributes of the environments where humans 
evolved and the ways in which the infant’s mind was formed by social encounters 
within those environments. In Chap. 6, An Unusually Human Time: Effects of The 
Most Social Stage on the Most Social Species by John Locke and Barry Bogin, the 
social nature of humans is addressed in light of infant altriciality, the demands of 
infant care, and social pressures related to group living that compelled psychologi-
cal adaptations, including intentionality and theory of mind. Next, Sybil Hart pres-
ents evolutionary developmental psychology models of maternal caregiving and 
infant-maternal attachment. Following an interpretation of breastfeeding as a 
species-­wide parenting behavior, she describes its practice by ancestral mothers and 
explains how it satisfied infants’ physical and psychological needs in a manner and 
to a degree that gave rise to the infant-maternal bond forming uniquely as a species-­
wide phenomenon. In their chapter, How Reliance on Allomaternal Care Shapes 
Primate Development with Special Reference to the Genus Homo, Sarah Hrdy and 
Judith Burkart discuss the exceptional degree to which hominins reared young with 
the help of alloparents. They propose that transformations arose in offspring due to 
social pressures that favored those who were motivated to be found appealing by 
alloparents and were best at monitoring others’ intentions, mental states, and 
preferences.
Chapter 9, Evolutionary Perspectives on Infant-Mother Conflict by Catherine 
Salmon and Jessica Hehman, discusses issues that presented as maternal resources 
were allocated among offspring, each of whom was more closely related to them-
selves than to their siblings. In particular, the chapter focuses on maternal-fetal 
conflict and weaning conflict. The next chapter, by Paula Ivey Henry and Gilda 
Morelli, discusses the biology, behavior, and sociocultural experience of Efe infants.

Evidence of resilience, such as lower mortality, high positive affect, and high rates 
of social engagement and food exchange, is considered in light of risk factors, 
including small size and slow growth, toward insight into ancestral conditions and 
forager infant variation. The final chapter in this part, by Jeffry Simpson and 
Margaret Jaeger, discusses the evolutionary foundations of attachment theory. The 
authors address features of the physical and social environments that shaped the 
attachment behavioral system and detail evolutionary-grounded, attachment-based 
models of social development toward understanding development as it occurs in 
individuals across the lifespan.
Part III focuses on the evolved basis of various components of infants’ cognitive 
and social-cognitive capacities. In Chap. 12, Hirokazu Doi and Nobuo Masataka 
consider how language acquisition in prelinguistic infants is underpinned by per-
ceptual capacities for processing features of music, such as pitch contour and rhyth-
mic structure. They highlight parallels between infants’ musical and linguistic 
abilities and consider how these abilities could have originated in non-human spe-
cies. In the next chapter, What is Unique in Infant Thinking About Others? Infant 
Social Cognition from an Evolutionary Perspective, David Buttelmann presents 
findings on infants’ understanding of others’ mental states, such as others’ desires, 
intentions and beliefs. He then compares these capacities in infants with those of 
nonhuman great apes toward identifying features that are uniquely human. Chapter 
14, Fear Learning in Infancy: An Evolutionary Developmental Perspective by 
David Rakison, describes traditional and non-associative theories of fear acquisi-
tion. The chapter then focuses on the prepared-learning model, which is explained 
as a privileged associative-learning mechanism that orients infants to threats that 
were significant in ancestral environments. In her chapter, Jealousy and the Terrible 
Twos, Sybil Hart interprets the need for exclusivity as an outcome of infant depen-
dence on mothers who suckled only one infant at a time. She explains that by repre-
senting a recurrent, life-threatening event, usurpation by a newborn sibling 
compelled advances in socio-emotional, cognitive, and motor development that 
enabled jealousy protest, a behavioral mechanism that helped prepare infants for the 
challenge of managing usurpation as they entered toddlerhood. In the final chapter, 
Caring for Others: The Early Emergence of Sympathy and Guilt by Amrisha Vaish 
and Tobias Grossmann, sympathy and guilt are construed as psychological mecha-
nisms that were compelled by the need to ensure the wellbeing of individuals who 
were potential sources of support. The authors discuss evidence of their early emer-
gence and discuss the functionality of reparative and prosocial behaviors that help 
establish and repair ruptures in cooperative relationships.
Throughout these chapters, this volume stands out for its attention to infancy as 
a discrete stage during which particular types of adaptations arose, and did so as a 
consequence of particular types of environmental pressures. They are offered with 
hope for their potential to illuminate basic understanding of the human brain and the 
environment that was responsible for shaping that brain.

Human Evolution and the Neotenous 
Infant
David F. Bjorklund
All mammal infants are dependent and helpless, but to varying degrees. Newborns 
of precocial species such as horses, mountain goats, and gazelles have all of their 
senses working and can stand and walk on wobbly legs just hours after birth. 
Neonates of more altricial species such as cats, rats, and dogs are born effectively 
blind and deaf (although their senses of touch and olfaction are much better devel-
oped) and can locomote just enough to make their ways to their mothers’ nipples. 
Primates, in general, have relatively well-developed senses and large brains at birth, 
but limited motor abilities. For example, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bono-
bos (Pan paniscus), humans’ closest genetic relatives, don’t sit up on their own until 
3–4 months and don’t walk until 6 or 7 months (Bründl et al., 2020; Kuroda, 1989). 
Humans follow a similar developmental trajectory, with all senses functioning to 
some degree at birth (although visual acuity is poor and improves over the first year 
in both humans and chimpanzees, Bard et al., 1995), although they take even longer 
to reach milestones of gross motor development (Bründl et al., 2020). The great 
apes in general follow a slow life history course. Parents (especially mothers) invest 
heavily in few offspring, who reach maturity relatively late in life. This trend is 
exaggerated in Homo sapiens, whose females reach sexual maturity at 16.5 years of 
age (on average among traditional groups), compared to 6.5  years for gorillas 
(Gorilla gorilla), 7.0 years for orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), and 9.8 years for 
chimpanzees (Harvey & Clutton-Brock, 1985). Taking so long to reach adulthood 
and sexual maturity has its obvious shortcomings, particularly death before repro-
ducing, and must therefore have some adaptive benefit, lest it would have been 
eliminated by natural selection. Most scholars argue that extending immaturity 
affords large-brained animals with opportunities to develop their survival skills and

learn the complexities of their physical or social environments (Alexander, 1989; 
Bjorklund, 2021; Dunbar, 2003; Whiten & Erdal, 2014). Humans represent the 
extreme of slow primate development, and this process begins in the earliest stages 
of life.
2.1  Heterochrony as an Engine of Evolutionary Change
Homo sapiens’ slow road to maturity begins early, in infancy, with human infants 
taking longer to achieve many developmental milestones than their simian relatives, 
and presumably than their hominin (group consisting of modern humans and their 
bipedal ancestors) predecessors. The retention of infantile or juvenile traits, includ-
ing the rate of development into later life, is referred to as neoteny. Neoteny is a 
form of heterochrony, genetic-based differences in developmental timing, which is 
a central concept in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, or Evo Devo 
(Carroll, 2005, 2017; Raff, 1996). Evo devo explores how different developmental 
mechanisms affect evolutionary change. In general, aspects of development can be 
accelerated or retarded relative to that of an ancestor (McKinney & McNamara, 
1991). Moreover, different parts, or modules, of an animal are relatively indepen-
dent from one another, such that natural selection can operate independently on 
different modules at different times. This is often accomplished through the expres-
sion of regulatory genes, which, unlike structural genes, do not code for proteins but 
rather determine when and whether structural genes are activated and how much 
protein they produce. According to Carroll (2005), “It is the switches [regulatory 
genes] that encode instructions unique to individual species and that enable differ-
ent animals to be made using essentially the same tool kit” (p. 211).
Although humans have often been described as a neotenous species (e.g., 
Bjorklund, 2021, in press; Bolk, 1926; Gould, 1977; Montagu, 1989), human evolu-
tion has clearly involved aspects of both acceleration and retardation of develop-
ment relative to our ancestors. For example, although human infants are slower to 
develop gross motor abilities than chimpanzees (and presumably our last common 
ancestor with chimpanzees), they tend to be weaned earlier than chimps (between 
2.5 and 3 years versus 4.5 and 5 years, Bogin, 2006), which results in a shortened 
inter-birth interval for human mothers. Moreover, as I’ll discuss in greater detail 
later in this chapter, brain development is faster (accelerated) during the prenatal 
period in human fetuses relative to other primates, with this rapid rate of growth 
being maintained postnatally in humans relative to the other great apes (a form of 
retardation). Thus, human evolution reflects a mosaic pattern of different traits aris-
ing at different times, often associated with heterochronic changes, some reflecting 
acceleration and others retardation of ancestral rates and characteristics.

2.2  Neoteny in Human Evolution
Although human evolution has clearly involved both acceleration and retardation of 
ancestral traits, my focus in this chapter will be on the former, neoteny, especially 
its role in human infancy.1 It may sound counterintuitive that evolutionary advances 
can sometimes be achieved by retaining infantile or juvenile traits into later devel-
opment. Yet, neoteny can be a source of evolutionary innovation. According to 
Gould (1977), “the early stages of ontogeny are a storehouse of potential adapta-
tions, for they contain countless shapes and structures that are lost through later 
allometries. When development is retarded, a mechanism is provided (via retention 
of fetal growth rates and proportions) for bringing these features forward to later 
ontogenetic stages” (p. 375).
As an example of neoteny in action, consider the work of the Russian zoologists 
Dmitry Belyayev and Lyudimila Trut, who bred wild red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) 
attempting to replicate the process that had converted wolves into domesticated 
dogs (Trut, 1999; Trut et al., 2009). The researchers selectively bred foxes for tame-
ability, mating the most human-receptive females with the most human-receptive 
males. After 20 generations 35% of the foxes were classified as “domesticated 
elites,” acting more like domesticated puppies than wild foxes. This domestication 
unexpectedly produced a suite of immature physical features, including floppy ears, 
wider and shorter heads, and shortened tails, snouts, legs, and upper jaws. Trut and 
her colleagues commented that, “The shifts in the timing of development brought 
about by selection of foxes for tameability have a neotenic-like tendency: the devel-
opment of individual somatic traits is decelerated, while sexual maturation is accel-
erated” (Trut et al., 2009, p. 354). Along a similar vein, some scholars have suggested 
that humans are a self-domesticated species, in which neotenous traits were selected 
for decreased reactive aggression and increased prosociality and cooperativeness 
(Bjorklund, 2021, in press; Hare, 2017; Hood, 2014; Wrangham, 2019).
Let me provide an example more directly relevant to human evolution. In most 
adult mammals the backbone connects to the opening in the back of the skull (the 
foramen magnum) so that the angle at which the spine connects to the skull (called 
the cranial flexure) is such that the animal is facing forward when walking. This 
position was different in the fetal period, with the head sitting more or less on top of 
the spine. During prenatal development, the cranial flexure shifts in most mammals, 
producing the adult quadrupedal orientation. This shift does not occur as substan-
tially in humans, however, so that the head of Homo sapiens is looking forward 
1 Technical note: Following McKinney and McNamara (1991), there are three types of heteroch-
ronic retardation: (1) progenesis, or earlier onset of some aspect of development; (2) neoteny, or 
reduced rate of development; and (3) post-displacement, or delayed onset of development. For ease 
of reading, I do not differentiate between these three types of retardation here, often using the term 
neoteny to refer to retardation of development in general. McKinney and McNamara also identi-
fied three forms of heterochronic acceleration: (1) hypermorphosis, or delayed offset of develop-
ment; (2) acceleration, or increased rate of development; and (3) pre-displacement, or earlier onset 
of growth (from Bjorklund, 2007, p. 44).

when standing on two legs. Thus, by retaining the embryonic relation between the 
skull and the spine, human heads sit atop their spines, permitting bipedal locomo-
tion (see Gould, 1977; Montagu, 1989). Table 2.1 provides a list of some human 
neotenous traits.
My focus in the remainder of this chapter will be on neotenous features of infancy 
and early childhood that promoted adaptation to local environments, promoting sur-
vival, and can be seen in present day human babies and toddlers. I begin looking at 
motor and physical features, followed by an examination of the role of neoteny in 
human brain evolution, and finally aspects of “cognitive neoteny,” immature fea-
tures of infants’ neural and cognitive processing that help babies adjust to their cur-
rent ecological niche or serve as the basis for more advanced cognition.
2.3  Neotenous Motor and Physical Features and Their 
Consequences for Infant Survival
Human infants’ extended period of physical dependency is a problem. Although all 
mammal infants are dependent on their mothers for nutrition, nurturing, and protec-
tion, this dependency is exaggerated in Homo sapiens. Human babies cannot cling 
to their mothers’ fur or grasp around their mothers’ necks, but must be carried and 
supported by their mothers for an extended period of time. Even once walking, 
human infants lack the physical dexterity and mental capacities to be left alone for 
any length of time. In fact, this dependency extends into childhood, a period between 
weaning and the eruption of permanent teeth (between about 3 and 7 years), which

Bogin (2021) contends is a stage unique to humans between infancy and the juve-
nile stages (between about 7 years and puberty, called middle childhood by psy-
chologists and educators). Thus, ancestral infants and toddlers required near-constant 
and extended care, and this factor may have been responsible, in part, for male-­
female pair bonding (a mother cannot adequately care for a child alone, necessitat-
ing help from the father) and for humans’ adoption of cooperative breeding, with a 
host of mostly female relatives assisting in the care of infants and young children 
(Hrdy, 1999; see DeSilva, Chap. 4; Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6; Hrdy & Burkart, Chap. 
8, this volume).
2.3.1  The Effects of Kindchenschema
Infants’ extended period of dependency and motor immaturity may necessitate that 
they receive care from adults, but other aspects of physical immaturity increase the 
likelihood that they will receive that care. John Bowlby (1969), the father of attach-
ment theory, observed that infant-parent attachment, critical for the survival of a 
helpless, long-dependent baby, is fostered by a number of infant features, including 
cries, smiles, movements, and immature facial features. The Nobel Prize-winning 
ethologist Konrad Lorenz (1943) noted a suite of facial features possessed by infants 
that promote feelings of affection and caregiving in adults, particularly mothers. 
Lorenz referred to these features as kindchenschema or baby schema. Compared to 
adult faces, infant faces have flat noses, fat cheeks, rounded heads that are large 
relative to body size, small chins, and large eyes relative to head size (e.g., Almanza-­
Sepúlveda et al., 2018). Everything else being equal, adults are more attentive to 
baby faces than to those of adults (e.g., Brosch et al., 2007; see Kringelbach et al., 
2016 and Lucion et al., 2017 for reviews). One possible reason for adults’ prefer-
ence for babyness is that these cues are relatively honest signs of fitness and health 
of infants.
The effects of the baby schema have been investigated in more than 100 studies 
over the last 70 years, and although there is some variability in the findings, most 
studies confirm Lorenz’s hypothesis that kindchenschema evolved to promote 
attachment to and nurturance from adults, all in the quest of surviving the perilous 
stage of infancy. Using a variety of measures, babies with cuter faces (i.e., faces 
with greater degrees of babyness) are associated with increased interest and caring 
from adults than less-cute infants. For example, adults evaluate infants with high 
levels of baby schema as friendlier, more sociable, more attractive, and easier to 
care for than less-baby-faced infants (e.g., Alley, 1981; Leibenluft et  al., 2004; 
Senese et al., 2013; Sprengelmeyer et al., 2009). Adults display greater empathy for 
and have more affectionate interactions with cuter than less-cute babies (e.g., 
Langlois et al., 1995; Glocker et al., 2009a; Machluf & Bjorklund, 2016); they also 
express greater motivation to care for, and make favorable hypothetical adoption 
decisions toward, cuter than less-cute infants (e.g., Aradhye et al., 2015; Volk et al., 
2007; Waller et al., 2004; see Franklin & Volk, 2018 for a review). This preference 
2  Human Evolution and the Neotenous Infant

24
for baby-faced infants extends to members of different races (e.g., Caucasian adults 
respond similarly to cues of cuteness in Caucasian, African, and Asian infants), and, 
as any puppy or kitten owner knows, we even respond to cuteness cues in other spe-
cies (e.g., Esposito et al., 2014; Golle et al., 2013). Consistent with the idea that 
baby-faced features promote affection and caregiving, premature infants, who dis-
play fewer of the kindchenschema features, are more apt to be abused at points 
during childhood than full-term infants (see Martin et al., 1974).
The effects of the baby schema have been documented in neuroimaging studies. 
For example, viewing infant faces typically produces faster neural responses involv-
ing more brain regions than when viewing adult faces (Glocker et al., 2009b; Hahn 
& Perrett, 2014; Leibenluft et al., 2004). Viewing infant faces elicits greater reac-
tions in brain areas associated with processing emotion (Baeken et  al., 2010; 
Glocker et al., 2009b; Nitschke et al., 2004), with Luo et al. (2015) concluding that 
“overall infant faces evoke [from adults] both stronger arousal and enhanced 
responses to both positive and negative cues from the infant” (p. 10). Research has 
also found that viewing baby faces is associated with greater activity in brain regions 
associated with empathy (e.g., Glocker et al., 2009b; Leibenluft et al., 2004), reward 
and attachment (e.g., Leibenluft et  al., 2004; Nitschke et  al., 2004), and motor 
behavior (Glocker et al., 2009b). The increased neural activation in motor areas 
when viewing baby faces may result in adults being extra careful when interacting 
with babies, as suggested by studies in which adults improved their fine-motor abili-
ties, as well as expressions of tenderness and calmness, after viewing cute infant 
faces (or faces of puppies and kittens) (Sherman et al., 2009, 2013). Overall, look-
ing at infant faces with high baby schema produces greater activation in brain areas 
associated with processing faces, emotion, and attention than viewing low-baby-­
schema faces (Luo et al., 2015).
One might think that the effects of babyness would be strongest at birth, when 
infants are most vulnerable and in need to care. This clearly makes good evolution-
ary sense from the infant’s perspective, but research has shown that babies are 
viewed as most cute between 3 and 6 months of age. Many newborns have mis-
shapen heads from their trip through the birth canal, and babies born prematurely 
have more atypical features and lower body weight than full-term infants. In studies 
by Franklin and her colleagues (2018), adults were asked to rate photographs of 
newborns, 3-month-olds, and 6-month-olds in terms of cuteness, health, and happi-
ness, and to make hypothetical adoption decisions about the babies. Although babies 
of all ages were rated relatively high on these dimensions (average ratings ranged 
from 3.06 for happiness to 4.08 for adoption decisions on a five-point scale), adults 
rated the 3- and 6-month-old infants higher than the newborns on each measure. 
One explanation for this finding is that, although it may be in the infant’s best inter-
est to garner as much attention and caring from adults as soon as possible, it may not 
be in the best interest of the parents. Ancestral parents, especially mothers, often 
had to evaluate whether and how much to invest in a newborn. In situations where 
resources are scarce and parents have other offspring to care for, it may be in the 
mother’s best interest to abandon a sickly child. So whereas it may not have been a 
benefit to neonates for their parents to objectively evaluate the health and fitness of 
D. F. Bjorklund

25
an infant, it likely was to the parents’ advantage (see Salmon & Hehman, Chap. 9, 
this volume).
Although the benefits of babyness may be greatest in the first year of life, they 
persist into early childhood. For example, in one study adults recommended less-­
severe punishment for more baby-faced 4-year-olds than for children with more 
mature faces (Zebrowitz et al., 1991). However, the positive effects of baby schema 
extend only to 4 or 5 years of age, after which adults’ judgments of attractiveness 
and likeability are similar to their judgments for adult faces (Luo et al., 2011). Other 
research has shown that neurological responses to faces vary as a function of the age 
of the person shown in the photograph, with images of infants having the greatest 
activation, followed by photos of prepubescent children, and the least activation for 
photos of adults (Proverbio et al., 2011).
2.3.2  Sex Differences in the Effects of Kindchenschema
The effects of the baby schema are found in both men and women, but they are 
greater in women, who historically (and surely prehistorically) have done the bulk 
of the infant care (e.g., Cárdenas et al., 2013; Sprengelmeyer et al., 2009; Yamamoto 
et al., 2009; see Hart, Chap. 7; Simpson & Jaeger, Chap. 11, this volume). For 
instance, in a series of experiments, Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) varied the kind-
chenshema features of infants’ faces and asked men and women to select which of 
two infant faces (one having more babyness features than the other) was cuter. 
Although women, overall, were more sensitive to subtle differences in cuteness than 
men, women’s selections varied with their age. Figure 2.1 shows the judgments of 
cuteness (selecting the photo with the higher cuteness value) for men and women of 
different ages. Women between 19 and 26 years of age were the most sensitive to

26
cuteness cues, followed closely by women 45–51 years of age. In contrast, older 
women, 53–60 years of age, were less able to distinguish the high-baby-schema 
faces and were comparable in their performance to both younger and older men. 
That these results were linked to hormone levels was supported by subsequent find-
ings that age-matched premenopausal women were more accurate at selecting the 
cuter faces than postmenopausal women, and that women using hormonal contra-
ception were better able to distinguish the cuter baby than women not on hormonal 
birth control (Sprengelmeyer et al., 2009).
Other research has found that sex differences in sensitivity to babyness is first 
seen in early adolescence, consistent with the hypothesis that it is related to changes 
in hormone levels (e.g., Borgi et al., 2014; Fullard & Reiling, 1976; Goldberg et al., 
1982; Gross, 1997). For example, Goldberg et al. (1982) showed 12- and 13-year-­
old girls and same-age boys slides of infant and adult faces and asked them to 
choose which faces they preferred. Half of the girls had had their first period (post-
menarcheal) and half had not (premenarcheal). The postmenarcheal girls preferred 
the infant faces significantly more often than both the premenarcheal girls and the 
boys, who did not differ from one another. This pattern is consistent with idea that 
a strong preference for baby-faced features, especially in girls, may reflect a prepa-
ration for parenthood, or at least did for our ancestors.
2.4  Neoteny and Brain Development
Infants’ immature, or neotenous, physical features helped keep ancestral babies 
alive by endearing them to adults and promoting attachment. This, of course, 
requires adaptations in adults (chiefly mothers) to be responsive to infants’ cues of 
dependency, which serve to benefit the inclusive fitness of both parents and off-
spring. As critical as these features are to survival, they are not unique to humans, as 
other species have evolved biparental families, cooperative breeding, and respond 
positively to immature features of their infants. What is special about humans is 
their cognition and social acumen. Homo sapiens possess symbolic representation, 
language, and tool-using and problem-solving abilities that, while possibly not 
unique in the animal kingdom, are far more advanced than those shown by any other 
creature. And although Homo sapiens surely evolved from other social primates, 
humans’ degree of social sophistication – abilities to learn from and cooperate and 
compete with social others – qualifies them as a hypersocial, or eusocial, species, 
analogous in some ways to the social insects (e.g., Tomasello, 2014, 2019; Wilson, 
2013). One currently popular theory of human evolution is the social brain hypoth-
esis, the idea that increased social cognition was a (perhaps the) driving force in 
human evolution and necessitated a large brain to handle the variety and complexity 
of human communities (e.g., Alexander, 1989; Bjorklund & Bering, 2003; Dunbar, 
2003). The building of such a brain was achieved, in large part, by heterochronic 
changes in the timing and rate of development, beginning prenatally and continuing 
through infancy.
D. F. Bjorklund

27
The adult human brain is about three times the size of chimpanzee and bonobo 
brains, as well as the brains of our early hominin ancestors, both in absolute size and 
in relation to body size (Jerison, 2000; see Wilder & Semendeferi, Chap. 3, this 
volume, for an excellent summary of infant brain development and evolution). The 
human brain got that large in part by producing more neurons and accelerating 
growth prenatally (forms of heterochronic acceleration) and by retaining the prena-
tal rate of brain growth postnatally (a form of heterochronic deceleration, or 
neoteny).
Although natural selection favored increased brain size in the hominin line even-
tuating in humans, there were morphological limits in how large a neonate’s skull 
(and thus brain) could be and still fit through the birth canal of a bipedal female. 
(Bipedality evolved prior to increased brain size in hominin evolution.) This is 
referred to as the obstetrical dilemma (Washburn, 1960). As a result, at birth human 
infants’ brains, while absolutely large in size compared to their simian relatives, are 
smaller relative to their eventual adult size than those of other primates. In most 
primates, babies are born when their brains are on average 47% of their eventual 
adult weight (DeSilva, 2016; Trevathan & Rosenberg, 2016). In contrast, human 
babies are born when their brains are about 28% of their eventual weight (DeSilva, 
2016; see DeSilva, Chap. 4, this volume).2
Following birth, human infants retain the rapid, prenatal rate of brain growth in 
terms of size of neurons, formation of dendritic connections, and myelination (Liu 
et al., 2012; Marchetto et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2012). By 6 months of age, infants’ 
brains achieve about 50% of their adult weight. This increases to 75% at 2 years, 
90% at 5 years, 95% at 10 years, with the final 5% of growth not being completed 
until late adolescence or early adulthood. Chimpanzees, in comparison, attain adult 
brain size by about 5 years of age (Bogin, 2006). Thus, even when humans develop 
“more brain” than other primates, they do it, in part, by retaining fetal growth rates 
long after birth.
Despite the “early” birth, human infants’ brains – that are still large in an abso-
lute sense – were surely a risk for our hominin ancestors. Death in childbirth, for 
both the mother and infant, was a real possibility for most of human history and 
prehistory, and likely because of this, women in most hunter-gatherer cultures give 
birth with the assistance of other women (e.g., Trevathan, 1987; See DeSilva, Chap. 
4, this volume). Given the risk associated with giving birth to such a large-brained 
baby, there must have been substantial benefits, or it would have been eliminated by 
natural selection.
The benefits were surely in what larger and more complex brains can achieve in 
terms of technical and social abilities. But brains not only evolved but also develop, 
and the particular pattern of infant brain development set the stage for the many 
2 Many of the assumptions of Washburn’s obstetrical-dilemma hypothesis have recently been chal-
lenged (e.g., Dunsworth, 2016; see DeSilva, Chap. 4, this volume). However, regardless of the 
validity of Washburn’s original claims, human newborns’ brains are smaller relative to their even-
tual adult size than those of other primates, with more development occurring in postnatal environ-
ments relative to apes.
2  Human Evolution and the Neotenous Infant

28
abilities that characterize human adult brains. By extending brain growth that would 
normally occur in the protective wombs of their mothers following the typical pri-
mate developmental pattern, human infants are exposed to a vastly different set of 
experiences. Their brains continue to develop rapidly while receiving visual, audi-
tory, tactile, olfactory, vestibular, and social stimulation that a typical primate would 
not receive until its brain was substantially more developed. Scholars have long 
proposed that human infants’ gestation is essentially extended into postnatal life 
and have referred to this period by a number of terms, including extrauterine spring, 
exterior gestation, exterogestation, and the fourth trimester (e.g., Konner, 2010; 
Montagu, 1989; Portmann, 1944/1990; Trevathan & Rosenberg, 2016). As a result 
of experiencing the external world at a time when their brains are going through a 
rapid period of change, human infants develop very differently than they would if 
they remained in the protective warmth of their mothers’ wombs, causing some 
theorists to argue that this extended period of brain development is responsible for 
the extraordinary features of Homo sapiens’ technical and social skills. Imagine, 
German zoologist Adolf Portmann (1944/1990) asks us, “the developing human 
spending the important maturation period of its first year in the dark, moist, uniform 
warmth of its mother’s womb… It will gradually become clear that world-open 
behavior of the mature form is directly related to early contact with the richness of 
the world, an opportunity available only to humans” (p. 93).
Although 1-year-old infants are hardly mental giants, some early-acquired devel-
opmental milestones serve as the basis of later essential social-cognitive accom-
plishments. For example, starting around 9-months of age, infants begin to display 
shared attention (e.g., mother and infant sharing attention about a third object), 
begin to see others as intentional agents, and are able to take the perspective of other 
people. In his shared intentionality theory, Tomasello (2019) refers to these early-­
developing abilities as joint intentionality, defined as “the cognitive capacity to cre-
ate a joint agent ‘we’ with other individuals, creating the possibility of taking the 
perspective of others” (p. 305). The abilities underlying joint intentionality, particu-
larly viewing others as intentional agents, are the basis for all more sophisticated 
social-cognitive accomplishments, and they would likely not have had the opportu-
nity to evolve were infants born following the typical primate schedule.
Tomasello (2019) argues that, “if we wish to explain how uniquely human psy-
chology is created, we must focus our attention on ontogeny, and especially on how 
great ape ontogeny in general has been transformed into human ontogeny in particu-
lar” (p. 6). One important way that great ape and human ontogeny differ is in the 
rate of brain development, with humans’ extension of the rapid prenatal rate of brain 
growth altering the very nature of infancy and the social-cognitive accomplishments 
of the species. Consistent with the social brain hypothesis that posits that changes in 
social cognition may be especially important in human psychological evolution is 
evidence that 2-year-old chimpanzees and human children display comparable lev-
els of physical cognition (e.g., tasks dealing with space, quantities, and tools), 
although 2-year-old children out-perform chimps on tasks of social cognition (e.g., 
imitation, nonverbal communication, and reading the intentions of others). 
Moreover, whereas children continue to improve on both physical- and

social-cognitive tasks for the next few years, chimpanzees do not, essentially attain-
ing adult levels by 2 years of age (Wobber et al., 2014).
Neoteny apparently not only played a role in extending the rate of brain develop-
ment but also affected the development of individual neurons and neuronal plastic-
ity. Synaptogenesis, the process of forming new synapses, is responsible in large 
part for human behavioral and cognitive plasticity, and such plasticity is greatest 
early in life. Neuronal metabolism and synaptic activity peak later in humans than 
in other primates (see, e.g., Bufill et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Petanjek et al., 2011; 
Somel et al., 2009), as does the process of myelination (Miller et al., 2012), thus 
extending neural plasticity into adulthood. Humans and chimpanzees possess simi-
lar genes associated with synapse formation in the cerebral cortex, with the expres-
sion of these genes peaking earlier in chimpanzees (before 1 year) than in humans 
(about 5 years) (Liu et al., 2012). Also, levels of gene expression associated with 
cortical synaptogenesis are similar in adolescent and adult humans to that observed 
in juvenile chimpanzees (see Bufill et al., 2011; Somel et al., 2009), causing Bufill 
et al. (2011, p. 735) to state that “human neurons belonging to particular association 
areas retain juvenile characteristic throughout adulthood, which suggests that a neu-
ronal neoteny has occurred in H. sapiens, which allows the human brain to function, 
to a certain degree, like a juvenile brain during adult life… Neuronal neoteny con-
tributes to increasing information storage and processing capacity throughout life, 
which is why it was selected during primate evolution and, to a much greater extent, 
during the evolution of the genus Homo.”
Human brains are substantially larger than those of the great apes and those of 
their hominin antecedents. Although there is no single cause for this brain expan-
sion, much of it was due to variation of growth rates relative to Homo sapiens’ 
ancestors, some due to accelerations and others due to retention of rapid prenatal 
growth rates into infancy, as well as retention of plasticity of individual neurons 
well into adulthood. Infants’ brains grow rapidly at a time when, if they followed a 
typical primate schedule, they would be tucked securely within their mothers’ 
wombs. Instead, because of their “early” birth, they experience a world of lights, 
sounds, smells, social others, and artifacts, which changes the nature of their cogni-
tion, and, in many ways, were responsible for the evolution of the modern 
human mind.
2.5  Cognitive Neoteny: The Benefit of Neural 
and Cognitive Inefficiency
It is hard to underestimate the impact on the evolution of the human mind of having 
lots of neurons that retain their plasticity well past infancy. However, the brains of 
human infants are still immature and inefficient compared to those of older children 
and adults, with synaptogenesis not peaking until childhood and many areas of the 
brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex, having little or no myelin. Thus, infants and 
2  Human Evolution and the Neotenous Infant

30
young children process information more slowly than older children and adults, 
such that their processing is effortful in that it uses substantial portions of their lim-
ited mental resources (Hasher & Zacks, 1979). In contrast, the cognitive processing 
of older children and adults is more apt to be automatic, in that it requires little or 
none of one’s limited capacity. Despite the obvious disadvantages to infants’ inef-
ficient neural processing, there are some benefits. According to Bjorklund and 
Green (1992, pp. 49–50):
Because little in the way of cognitive processing can be automatized early, presumably 
because of children’s incomplete myelination, they are better prepared to adapt, cognitively, 
to later environments. If experiences early in a life yielded automatization, the child would 
lose the flexibility necessary for adult life. Processes automatized in response to the 
demands of early childhood may be useless and likely detrimental for coping with the very 
different cognitive demands faced by adults. Cognitive flexibility in the species is main-
tained by an immature nervous system that gradually permits the automatization of more 
mental operations, increasing the likelihood that lessons learned as a young child will not 
interfere with the qualitatively different tasks required of the adult.
2.5.1  The Adaptive Value of Neural Inefficiency
Perhaps the greatest benefit of neural inefficiency in early development is in terms 
of plasticity, the ability to change. As we saw in the previous section, human neu-
rons retain their ability to change well into adulthood (neuronal neoteny). However, 
this does not mean that plasticity is infinite. Rather, experiences early in life result 
in strengthening connections among some sets of neurons and weakening or elimi-
nating connections among others. The end result is a reduction of plasticity. 
However, because neuronal processing is relatively inefficient during the first 
2 years of life, high levels of plasticity are retained. Because of this, the effects of a 
deleterious early environment can be reversed should circumstances change.
Such plasticity has been repeatedly demonstrated in nonhuman animals (e.g., 
Suomi & Harlow, 1972) and human children (e.g., Beckett et al., 2010; Nelson 
et al., 2007; Troller-Renferee et al., 2018). For example, children who spend their 
early months in understaffed, neglectful institutions display signs of neurological, 
social, and intellectual deficits that tend to persist into adolescence (e.g., Beckett 
et al., 2010; Mackes et al., 2020; Merz et al., 2016). Such psychological effects are 
mirrored by differences in brain functioning. According to developmental neurosci-
entist Charles Nelson (2007), “many forms of institutional rearing lack most ele-
ments of a mental-health-promoting environment. As a result, the young nervous 
system, which actively awaits and seeks out environmental input, is robbed of such 
input … institutionalization appears to lead to a reduction in cortical brain activ-
ity … and to dysregulation of neuroendocrine systems that mediate social behavior” 
(p. 16). However, if children are removed from such institutions before 18–24 months, 
they often display substantial recovery of social, emotional, and intellectual func-
tioning. In contrast, children who remain in institutions much past their second

31
birthdays are less apt to show recovery of typical psychological functioning (e.g., 
Beckett et al., 2010; Merz & McCall, 2010; Nelson et al., 2007).
The results of institutionalization studies clearly show that children can rebound 
from the negative effects of social deprivation if they experience a supportive envi-
ronment beginning around 18 or 24 months of age. Some researchers have proposed 
that human development is highly canalized during the first 18 or 24 months of life, 
meaning that children follow the species-typical path “under a wide range of diverse 
environments and exhibit strong self-righting tendencies following exposure to 
severely atypical environments” (McCall, 1981, p.  5). Although infants may be 
negatively affected by early neglectful environments, there is a tendency to return to 
a course of normalcy when they experience more supportive conditions. As infants’ 
brains mature, the degree of plasticity reduces, making it more difficult to reverse 
the effects of a maladaptive environment. Eighteen to 24 months also corresponds 
to a time when the rate of brain growth begins to slow (Leigh, 2004; Matsuzawa, 
2001) and when children’s cognitive abilities undergo substantial changes (e.g., the 
onset of language and the transition from Piaget’s sensorimotor to preoperational 
periods), further suggesting that maturational-based changes in brain development 
and organization are responsible, in part, for the reduction in plasticity at this time.
2.5.2  The Adaptive Value of Poor Memory
At the core of cognition is memory, and there is an extensive literature demonstrat-
ing age-related differences in memory from infancy through adulthood (see, e.g., 
Bauer & Fivush, 2014). Young infants demonstrate memory mainly through percep-
tual phenomena (e.g., showing dishabituation to novel stimuli) or conditioning. For 
example, Rovee-Collier and her colleagues developed the conjugate reinforcement 
procedure, in which a ribbon is tied to an infant’s ankle and then to a mobile over 
the infant’s head while in a crib. Infants learn that their leg movements cause the 
mobile to move, and demonstrate this by kicking their legs when, after initially 
learning the connection between kicking and the movement of the mobile, they later 
kick their leg when placed in the crib when the ribbon is not tied to the mobile (see 
Rovee-Collier & Cuevas, 2009). In one set of experiments, Rovee-Collier and her 
colleagues (1992) showed that 2-month-old infants remembered the connection 
between kicking and the movement of the mobile but only when the crib liner was 
the same during both acquisition and testing. Rovee-Collier and Shyi (1992) pro-
posed that this reflects an extreme dependency on context for young infants that 
may prevent them from retrieving memories in “inappropriate” situations. Given 
infants’ poor inhibitory abilities (e.g., Baird et al., 2002; Diamond, 1985; Holmboe 
et al., 2008), such dependency on context may prevent infants from retrieving previ-
ously learned memories (actions) in inappropriate situations. As infants gain more 
experience with their physical and social worlds over the course of the first year, 
they become less dependent on the context in remembering (Learmonth et al., 2004; 
Rovee-Collier & Cuevas, 2009), such that experiences in one context can be

usefully applied in similar contexts. According to Hartshorn and her colleagues 
(2004, p. 76), “As the physical world of the developing infant progressively expands 
and the infant’s niche also changes, the behavioral solutions to problems that char-
acterized the relatively static habitat and niche of the younger infant must also 
change or lose their adaptive utility.”
As children acquire language, they begin to recall information according to 
scripts, schematic organizations with real-world events organized in terms of their 
causal and temporal characteristics (Nelson, 1996). Children learn what usually 
happens in a situation (e.g., eating breakfast in the morning) and remember novel 
information in the context of these familiar events (see Bauer, 2007; Fivush et al., 
1992). However, 2-year-old children often show an over-reliance on scripts, remem-
bering only script-consistent facts and failing to remember novel experiences (e.g., 
Fivush & Hamond, 1990). Rather than being maladaptive, Nelson (1996, 2005) 
suggested that young children’s reliance on scripts helps them predict the probabil-
ity of events in the future. According to Nelson (1996, p. 174):
Memory for a single, one-time occurrence of some event, if the event were not traumatic or 
life-threatening, would not be especially useful, given its low probability. Thus, a memory 
system might be optimally designed to retain information about frequent and recurrent 
events—and to discard information about unrepeated events—and to integrate new infor-
mation about variations in recurrent events into a general knowledge system.
Similarly, Rovee-Collier and Giles (2010) argued that infants’ generally poor 
long-term memory reflects “rapid forgetting… an evolutionarily selected survival-­
related strategy that facilitates young infants’ adaptation to their rapidly changing 
niche and enables them to shed the excessive number of recent, rapidly formed 
associations that are potentially useless, irrelevant, or inappropriate” (p. 203) (cf., 
Bjorklund & Green, 1992). Rovee-Collier proposed that the first 9- or 10-months of 
life is a time of “exuberant learning” accompanied by rapid synaptogenesis and 
pruning.
There has also been some speculation that young children’s limited working 
memories may facilitate the initial acquisition of language. For example, some 
researchers have shown that the different sensory systems develop at different times, 
coordinated with sensory experiences, so that the development of one sensory sys-
tem does not interfere with the development of other sensory systems (Turkewitz & 
Kenny, 1982). Newport (1991) made an analogous argument for the early stages of 
language acquisition, proposing that young children’s limited working memories 
simplify the body of language they process, which makes the complicated syntacti-
cal system of any human language easier to learn. Newport developed a computer 
simulation that varied how much the computer program could keep in memory at 
any one time, equivalent to varying the size of a child’s short-term store. She 
reported that restricting the computer program’s memory resulted in early deficits in 
language learning (for instance, whole words were often lost), but that word endings 
that denote verb tense and plurals were more likely to be retained. Newport con-
cluded, “overall, then, a learning mechanism with a restricted input filter [smaller 
short-term memory] more successfully acquired a morphology [syntactic structure];

the same learning mechanism with a less restricted filter [larger short-term mem-
ory], or with no filter at all, entertains too many alternative analyses and cannot 
uniquely determine which is the better one” (p. 127). (See also Elman [1994], who 
reached a similar conclusion using a very different type of computer simulation.) 
Experimental support for Newport’s and Elman’s hypotheses comes from research 
demonstrating that adults learn an artificial grammar faster when presented with 
smaller rather than larger units of the language (Kersten & Earles, 2001).
The research examined in this section may not reflect neoteny in a literal sense. 
Inefficient neural processing or limited memory abilities do not reflect features of 
juvenile ancestors that have been retained in modern adults. They do reflect the 
consequences of prolonging neural maturation, and they are examples of what are 
usually thought of as immature or poor cognition that actually may have an adaptive 
value for infants and children at a particular time in development. Natural selection 
has made use of infants’ immaturity to help them develop into children and later 
adults who can function well in their communities (Bjorklund & Green, 1992).
2.6  Conclusion
Our ancient ancestors evolved to become the species we are today. But each of our 
ancestors also developed, and the forces of natural selection operated as potently, if 
not more so, on the early stages of development as on later stages. Modifications of 
development, including changes in rate and timing of developmental milestones 
(heterochrony), had an enormous impact on the evolution of many species, with 
humans being no exception. Although there is ample evidence of both heterochronic 
acceleration and retardation in Homo sapiens, neoteny can be seen as the source of 
many of our species’ unique features. This may be most clearly seen in infancy, 
from birth to weaning, with neotenic changes in infants’ physical characteristics, 
rate of brain growth, and enhanced neural plasticity fostering babies’ survival and 
transforming the nature of their cognitive and social functioning to serve as the 
foundation for the modern human mind.

Infant Brain Development and Plasticity 
from an Evolutionary Perspective
Linnea Wilder and Katerina Semendeferi
The evolution of the human brain following the split from the last common ancestor 
of hominins and Pan (Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus) has involved a substantial 
increase in size as well as modifications to the internal, cellular organization. These 
changes were likely achieved through modifications in the timing and rate of devel-
opment during hominin evolution. The result of those changes is a uniquely derived 
developmental trajectory of the brain in humans compared to non-human primates, 
which includes an accelerated rate of growth prenatally and in infancy, prolonged 
development, and substantial postnatal plasticity.
The outcome of these evolutionary modifications is significant brain growth and 
development occurring postnatally. This allows the brain to be shaped by the physi-
cal and social environment outside of the uterus to a greater degree than is seen in 
non-human primates, contributing to the cognitive flexibility, intelligence, and brain 
plasticity of humans (Leigh & Park, 1998; Neubauer & Hublin, 2012; Piantadosi & 
Kidd, 2016).
3.1  Brain Development in Infancy
3.1.1  General Primate Development
Brain development in primates begins with the formation of the neural tube, the first 
structure of the central nervous system to arise in primate embryos, which develops 
to form the brain and spinal cord. In humans, neural tube formation is complete by 
the end of the third week of gestation. A region of the interior of the neural tube 
known as the ventricular zone is lined with neural progenitor cells. Initially, these

cells divide symmetrically, with each cell producing two progenitor cells. This 
increases the pool of progenitor cells and thus the number of neurons that can be 
produced. They later gradually shift to asymmetric division, producing one neural 
progenitor and one neuron. The progenitor cells remain in the ventricular zone pro-
ducing more neurons, which then migrate out of the ventricular zone (Stiles & 
Jernigan, 2010).
Newly born cortical neurons migrate to the emerging cortical plate, where they 
will form the laminar structure of the cortex in an inside-out manner, with the earli-
est born neurons populating the deeper cortical layers (V/VI), and later born neu-
rons populating more superficial layers (II/III) (Cooper, 2008). Neural proliferation 
occurs almost exclusively prenatally, with a peak in neuron density in the second 
half of gestation. This is followed by a period of apoptosis, where approximately 
half of all neurons produced undergo programmed cell death, resulting in neuron 
numbers at birth that are near adult values (Rabinowicz et  al., 1996; Stiles & 
Jernigan, 2010). Proliferation and migration of glial cells begin prenatally after the 
onset of neurogenesis, first with astrocytes, then oligodendrocytes (Lee et al., 2000). 
Neurogenesis continues throughout life in primates in only two regions, the dentate 
gyrus of the hippocampus and the olfactory bulb (Kornack & Rakic, 2001; Taupin 
& Gage, 2002). There is no reliable evidence of postnatal neurogenesis in the pri-
mate neocortex, but the production of glial cells continues throughout life (Gage, 
2019; Lee et al., 2000).
As neurons reach their target destinations, they begin to extend axons, and den-
drites form synapses with other cells. This begins prenatally and continues after 
birth. This initial cell growth and synaptogenesis is followed by a period of pruning 
unnecessary or unused connections. This activity-dependent fine-tuning of connec-
tions allows the brain to be modified in response to the environment (Buss et al., 
2006; Oppenheim, 1989). Following gliogenesis, oligodendrocytes begin to form 
myelin sheaths around axons, aiding in the transmission of neural signals.
The microstructural changes described above are reflected in changes to the 
gross anatomy of the brain. Dendritic growth causes an increase in gray matter 
(mostly neurons and glial cells) volume early in life, followed by a later decline. 
This is paralleled by changes in cortical thickness, which initially increases, then 
thins as synapses and dendrites are pruned (Brown et al., 2012; Lyall et al., 2015). 
Myelination causes the growth of white matter (mostly myelinated axons), which 
begins slowly prenatally and continues steadily until reaching maximum volume 
(Sakai et al., 2011). In some primates, these changes occur at different times (i.e., 
are heterochronous) across different regions of the brain (Bianchi et  al., 2013). 
Generally, primary processing regions develop first, and association regions such as 
the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which serves higher order cognitive and emotional 
functions, develop later (Petanjek et al., 2011; Bianchi et al., 2013).
Less is known about the development of subcortical structures in primates, but 
there are data available for amygdala development in humans and non-human pri-
mates (Payne et al., 2010; Ulfig et al., 2006). The amygdala is known to play an 
important role in primate behavior and typical development in the production and 
processing of social and emotional behavior (Gabard-Durnam et al., 2018). The

amygdala is of particular interest to human evolution as it shows evidence for reor-
ganization in humans relative to non-human apes. The human amygdala has a larger 
lateral nucleus, with a greater number of neurons than expected for an ape brain of 
its size. This expansion of the lateral nucleus may contribute to enhanced social 
cognition in humans (Barger et al., 2007, 2012). The primate amygdala emerges 
early in prenatal development but is immature at birth, allowing the postnatal expe-
rience to shape its development (Payne et al., 2010; Ulfig et al., 2006).
Although all primates follow the same general pattern of brain development, 
there are differences in the timing of these events, which have been best studied in 
macaques (Macaca mulatta), common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and humans.
3.1.1.1  Macaque
The majority of growth in total brain volume in macaques, approximately 60%, 
occurs prenatally, with slower growth postnatally (Leigh, 2004; Malkova et  al., 
2006). Total brain volume, as well as both gray and white matter volume, increase 
for the first five postnatal months. This is followed by a slight decline in gray matter 
volume by the end of infancy after which it stabilizes. White matter volume contin-
ues to increase through infancy and into the juvenile period, with both gray matter 
and white matter volumes reaching adult values by the onset of puberty (Kim et al., 
2020; Knickmeyer et al., 2010). Postnatal growth of the amygdala is greatest in the 
first 2 weeks, with growth slowing and finally stabilizing around 8 months of age, 
near the end of infancy, when the adult volume is reached (Payne et al., 2010).
At the cellular level, neurogenesis in macaques begins on embryonic day 40, 
with synaptogenesis starting by embryonic day 65 (average gestation 
length = 167 days) (Bourgeois & Rakic, 1993). Across the macaque cortex, there is 
a rapid increase in density of synapses in the last two prenatal months that takes 
place concurrently in all cortical layers. This increase continues throughout the first 
six postnatal months, the majority of the infancy period, after which the density of 
synapses begins to decline as unused connections are pruned (Bourgeois et  al., 
1994; Rakic et al., 1986, 1994).
3.1.1.2  Chimpanzee
Combining longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data with cross-­
sectional measures of brain volume at death allows the rate of chimpanzee brain 
growth to be described throughout the prenatal and infant period. As shown in MRI 
studies, the rate of brain growth in chimpanzees accelerates in utero until it reaches 
its peak growth of approximately 12 cc/week at gestation week (GW) 22, after 
which the rate of brain growth gradually slows, reaching 4.1 cc/week at the end of 
gestation (see Fig. 3.1). At birth, the neonatal chimpanzee brain is approximately 
150 cc, 40% of its adult volume (Sakai et al., 2012). Shown through measures of 
brain size at death, postnatally, the rate of brain growth continues to slow until

42
around 5 years of age, when adult brain volume, 380 cc, is achieved (Herndon et al., 
1999; Leigh, 2004).
Gray matter volume in chimpanzees increases throughout infancy. In non-­
prefrontal regions, gray matter volume reaches its peak at the end of infancy, 3 years 
of age. After 3 years of age gray matter volume in non-prefrontal regions declines 
until reaching adult values. Gray matter growth is prolonged in prefrontal regions, 
with gray matter volume continuing to increase past infancy before eventually 
declining. White matter growth occurs throughout infancy, growing 173% and 62% 
of the volume at birth in the prefrontal and non-prefrontal regions of the cerebrum, 
respectively. Cerebral white matter reaches 50% (prefrontal) and 64% (non-­
prefrontal) of adult volume by 3 years of age. This growth continues past infancy, 
only reaching adult volume after puberty (Sakai et al., 2011). The growth of white 
matter is largely the result of changes in myelin. Myelination begins prenatally, with 
20% of neocortical myelination complete at birth, and continues throughout infancy 
and the juvenile period before reaching adult levels around the time of sexual matu-
rity, with myelin growth in prefrontal regions slightly prolonged relative to other 
brain regions (Miller et al., 2012).
At the cellular level, brain development is described through postmortem histo-
logical studies of neural anatomy at different ages throughout life. Synaptogenesis 
in chimpanzees occurs concurrently across cortical areas, similar to macaques, with 
a peak density of synapses reached at 3–5 years of age, just after infancy ends 
(Bianchi et al., 2013). There is a growth of dendrites across the cortex in infancy, 
which appears to be prolonged in the prefrontal cortex. In adult primates, including 
macaques, chimpanzees, and humans, dendritic trees of pyramidal neurons in PFC 
are longer, and have more branches and spines than those of primary sensory areas 
(Jacobs, 2001; Hrvoj-Mihic et al., 2013). In infant chimpanzees, the dendritic trees 
and spine density in the PFC are not as elaborate as in other cortical areas, indicat-
ing continued development of pyramid neurons in the PFC past infancy (Bianchi 
et al., 2013).

3.1.1.3  Human
Prenatally, the rate of growth of the human brain accelerates from the period of GW 
16 to GW 32, reaching a growth rate of 26.1 cc/week at GW 32, more than six times 
the rate of growth in a chimpanzee fetus of the same gestational age (Fig. 3.1). This 
rate of growth is maintained throughout the remainder of the fetal period, with brain 
size at birth being approximately 400 cc, about 30% of adult brain volume (Holland 
et al., 2014). The growth rate begins to decrease after birth.
Total brain volume increases dramatically in humans during infancy, doubling in 
size in the first year of life, to approximately 72% of adult volume (Fig. 3.2). This 
growth is largely due to increases in gray matter, which grows by 149%, while white 
matter increases by 11% at the same time. In the second year of life, there is a 15% 
increase in total brain volume, to approximately 83% of adult volume. In this period 
gray matter increases by 14%, while white matter increases by 19% (Knickmeyer 
et al., 2008). The dramatic increase in gray matter in the first year of life is in part

due to growth of the cerebellum, which doubles in volume in the first three postnatal 
months, and increasing another 70% from 3 months to 1 year (Holland et al., 2014; 
Knickmeyer et al., 2008). In the cerebral hemispheres both gray and white matter 
volume increase in infancy, with gray matter possibly peaking at age 4, while white 
matter continues to slowly increase (Fig. 3.2) (Matsuzawa, 2001; Pfefferbaum et al., 
1994). In the first 2 years of life, cerebral gray matter growth is slowest in primary 
processing areas, with frontal association cortices (including portions of the PFC) 
growing more rapidly (Gilmore et al., 2012).
Throughout infancy cerebral white matter grows at a faster rate than cerebral 
gray matter, growing 185% in prefrontal regions from 1 to 6 years of age, reaching 
76.2% of adult volume, and 80% in non-prefrontal regions in the same period, 
reaching 77.2% of adult volume (Matsuzawa, 2001). The growth in the white matter 
continues past infancy, particularly in prefrontal regions, due to prolonged myelin 
growth. Myelination begins prenatally. In the neocortex, this is restricted to postna-
tal development and continues beyond adolescence (Miller et al., 2012).
The amygdala in humans can be found as early as GW 8, and structural connec-
tivity is present by GW 13 (Gabard-Durnam et al., 2018). Postnatally, there is a 
large increase in amygdala volume in the first 3 months of life, with continued 
growth until around 4  years of age (Holland et  al., 2014; Tottenham, 2012). 
Development continues past this point, with mature amygdala-PFC connectivity 
emerging after 10 years of age in typical development (Gee et al., 2013a).
Neurogenesis begins at GW 6 in humans, with the number of neurons reaching a 
peak at GW 28 then declining due to cell death to adult values at the time of birth 
(Rabinowicz et al., 1996). Postnatal growth in gray matter is due to neuropil growth, 
which reflects cellular development, specifically the growth of dendrites and axons 
(Knickmeyer et al., 2008; Rabinowicz et al., 1996). Neuronal development in the 
PFC is prolonged relative to other cortical regions. At birth, the earlier generated 
layer V pyramidal neurons of the PFC have larger and more complex dendritic trees 
than those of the later generated layer III pyramidal neurons (see Fig. 3.3). In the 
first year of life, the dendritic trees of layer III pyramidal neurons grow more rapidly 
than those of layer V, with neurons in both layers reaching similar growth. This is 
followed by a period of minor dendritic growth, a “plateau” period, until 2 years of

age. Between the ages of 2 and 3 years, these neurons undergo a period of substan-
tial dendritic elaboration, resulting in dendritic trees that are more extensive that 
those of layer V pyramidal neurons (Petanjek et al., 2008; Hrvoj-Mihic et al., 2013).
Synaptogenesis begins by GW 27 in humans and peaks around 5 years of age, 
with synaptic refinement and pruning continuing into adulthood (Huttenlocher & 
Dabholkar, 1997; Petanjek et al., 2011). Development of synapses is heterochro-
nous in different cortical areas, with primary processing areas developing more rap-
idly, while the development of the PFC is prolonged (Huttenlocher & Dabholkar, 
1997; Petanjek et al., 2011).
3.1.2  Uniquely Human Features of Infant Brain Development
Beginning prenatally, and continuing through early postnatal life, the rate of brain 
growth in humans is much greater than in chimpanzees (Fig. 3.1). In the prenatal 
period, this rate of growth is greater even relative to the greater volume of the human 
fetal brain. At birth, the human brain is approximately 2.5 times larger than a neo-
natal chimpanzee brain, and slightly larger than the average adult chimpanzee brain. 
However, humans achieve a smaller percentage of brain growth prenatally than 
chimpanzees, ≈30% compared to ≈40% of adult volume at birth, respectively 
(DeSilva, Chap. 4, this volume). Postnatally, humans and chimpanzees appear to 
share a derived pattern of a rapid rate of postnatal brain growth compared to Old 
World monkeys.
After 18 months of age, the rate of brain growth in humans and chimpanzees 
slows significantly, with both species reaching a similar growth rate at this time 
(Fig. 3.2). Brain growth duration does not vary substantially between species, sug-
gesting that the change in the rate of growth during prenatal and early postnatal life 
is what allows the human brain to grow so large. This rapid growth is energetically 
costly. Approximately 87% of the resting metabolic rate of a newborn human is 
devoted to brain growth and function, while a chimpanzee of the same age only 
requires 45% of the resting metabolic rate to maintain brain growth and function 
(Bogin, 2007). In addition to a greater rate of overall brain growth, humans have 
more rapid growth of white matter in the brain than chimpanzees during infancy, 
particularly in prefrontal regions, and myelination is prolonged past sexual maturity 
well into adulthood.
At the cellular level, brain maturation follows the same overall pattern in humans 
as in non-human primates. There is a period of exuberant neuron production and 
synaptogenesis, with neurons and synapses later pruned in an activity-dependent 
manner, allowing the brain to be modified in response to the environment. 
Nevertheless, there are differences in the timing of these events in humans relative 
to non-human primates. Maturation of pyramidal neurons in humans appears pro-
longed compared to non-human primates. Human neurons display delayed growth 
in dendritic length and dendritic spine number, with the substantial developmental 
remodeling of synaptic spine density in the prefrontal cortex continuing until 
3  Infant Brain Development and Plasticity from an Evolutionary Perspective

46
approximately 30 years of age (Petanjek et al., 2011). Novel experimental studies 
using induced pluripotent stem cells to directly compare human and chimpanzee 
neuronal development showed that human pyramidal neurons develop and migrate 
more slowly than chimpanzee pyramidal neurons. Even though the initial growth of 
dendrites and dendritic spines occurs earlier in chimpanzees, growth is prolonged in 
human neurons. This allows humans to have a greater total dendritic length and a 
greater number of dendritic spines (Marchetto et al., 2019).
Synaptogenesis in both humans and chimpanzees is prolonged compared to 
macaques. This is additionally prolonged in humans at least in the prefrontal cortex, 
and is reflected in changes in gene expression, with synaptic genes reaching peak 
expression in the prefrontal cortex before 1 year of age in chimpanzee and macaques, 
and 5 years of age in humans (Liu et al., 2012). Functionally important aspects of 
synaptic remodeling may occur during “plateau” periods, described for humans 
above. These occur in both humans and non-human primates later in development 
(Levitt, 2003). However, the early phase of limited growth in layer III of the PFC 
has only been observed in humans and may represent a specialization for enhanced 
cognition and cortico-cortical connectivity (Petanjek et al., 2008).
Brain development in human infancy is characterized by both rapid early growth 
and prolonged cellular maturation. Particularly interesting is the fact that regions 
with prolonged cellular maturation, such as the PFC, also exhibit the most rapid 
growth in the early postnatal period in humans (Gilmore et al., 2012). These fea-
tures contribute to neuroplasticity in infancy, allowing the brain to be modified by 
the environment while the infant is in a critical period of social and cultural learning.
3.2  Neuroplasticity and Atypical Development
Typical neural development in primates relies on both experience-expectant and 
experience-dependent plasticity. Experience-dependent plasticity is idiosyncratic, 
knowledge that is unique to the individual, shaping them for their particular envi-
ronment. Experience-expectant plasticity is associated with critical periods in 
development, when expected experiences shape the developing brain in a species-­
typical way (Greenough & Black, 1999). These expected experiences are required 
for typical neural development, and may be experienced atypically in individuals 
with some neurodevelopmental disorders.
In social primates, there is a critical period during infancy for the development of 
social behaviors. Both common marmosets and macaques deprived of social contact 
as infants display aberrant social behaviors, including increased fear and a lack of 
social play, which persist into adulthood (Dettling et al., 2002; Harlow & Harlow, 
1962). This atypical development does not require complete social deprivation. 
Macaques raised without their mother, but with age-matched peers until 6 months 
of age, also displayed aberrant social behaviors (Spinelli et al., 2009). In common 
marmosets, typically in constant contact with their parents early after birth, separa-
tion from both parents for just 2 h per day in the first month of life is enough to

47
induce stress and decreased social play (Dettling et al., 2002). This suggests that 
social contact with the parent(s) during infancy is required for species-typical devel-
opment of social behavior to occur.
Early life stress in infancy has similar results in humans. Children who experi-
ence an early life neglect have higher levels of anxiety and depression that may be 
tied to altered connectivity between the amygdala and PFC (Tottenham, 2012). 
Early life stress in humans results in reduced integrity of white matter between 
frontal and limbic regions of the brain, as well as accelerated development of func-
tional connectivity between the amygdala and medial PFC (Bick et al., 2015; Gee 
et al., 2013b). This accelerated development may be adaptive, as it does appear to 
provide greater resilience to stress. However, it also decreases early life plasticity 
and may prevent optimal neural development (Gee et al., 2013b). In the extreme 
case of institutionalization devoid of typical parental care, children show significant 
decreases in both cortical gray matter and white matter volumes. These negative 
effects can be partially ameliorated by providing a replacement parental figure, as 
long as this is done prior to 2 years of age (Nelson et al., 2009). Even less extreme 
stress can negatively impact brain development in infancy, as is the case with socio-
economic status, now known to positively correlate with cortical surface area (Noble 
et al., 2015).
Studies of brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders, in conjunction 
with studies of behavior and cognition in these disorders, shed light on the impact 
of neuroplasticity, which can be seen in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 
Williams syndrome (WS). ASD is complex and heterogenous, genetically and phe-
notypically, while WS has a known deletion of approximately 25–28 genes that 
underlies all typical WS cases, and a more consistent behavioral and cognitive pro-
file (Bellugi et al., 2000; Strømme et al., 2002). Despite the differences in etiology, 
both ASD and WS involve altered social behavior, and both provide examples of 
alterations to typical development.
ASD is characterized by early overgrowth in the brain, likely the result of exu-
berant neurogenesis or reduced apoptosis prenatally, and impaired white matter 
tracts in infancy (Shen & Piven, 2017). The growth of axons and dendrites from an 
excessive number of neurons may accelerate the rate of brain growth in infancy. 
This is seen in the PFC, where children with ASD have 67% more neurons than 
typically developing controls (Courchesne et al., 2011). Young children with ASD 
experience early overgrowth of the amygdala so that in childhood they have enlarged 
amygdalas relative to controls. They do not show typical growth of the amygdala 
during childhood that occurs in controls, and by adolescence amygdala volume in 
ASD subjects is equal to that of controls (Schumann, 2004). Overall neuron number 
is decreased in the ASD amygdala, and serotonergic innervation is increased rela-
tive to controls (Lew et al., 2020; Schumann & Amaral, 2006). Alterations to brain 
growth and neural development during infancy are not limited to the area directly 
affected. During this critical period of development, while the brain is highly sensi-
tive to external input, disruptions to development can alter functional connectivity 
across the brain, resulting in substantial cognitive and behavioral consequences. In 
ASD it is hypothesized that early life neural overgrowth may alter the course of

48
typical development, resulting in overconnectivity of local circuits and undercon-
nectivity of long-range networks, impacting neural function throughout life 
(Courchesne & Pierce, 2005).
In WS, alterations to the brain appear to be more consistent and genetically 
guided than in ASD. WS is characterized by hypersociability, a lack of social inhibi-
tion, along with high levels of anxiety (Bellugi et al., 2000). In adulthood, WS 
subjects have alterations in parts of the brain known to be involved in social behav-
ior. They have reduced neuron density and higher glia density, along with relatively 
decreased dendritic trees in some regions of the PFC (Hrvoj-Mihic et al., 2017; Lew 
et al., 2017; Wilder et al., 2018). They also have a higher number of neurons, and 
decreased serotonergic innervation in the amygdala (Lew et al., 2018, 2020). There 
are very few studies on morphology of the infant and developing WS brain, but it 
appears that the alterations present in WS adults begin prenatally or in infancy. 
Increased neuron number in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is present even in 
the youngest WS subject examined (<1 month of age), and increased glia density in 
the PFC is present at 8 months of age (Lew et al., 2018; Wilder et al., 2018). These 
early life alterations in WS may impact functional connectivity and future develop-
ment within these brain regions, limiting neuroplasticity in some respects. This 
could be reflected in the behavioral profile of WS, which is consistent even cross-­
culturally (Zitzer-Comfort et al., 2007).
3.3  Brain Development in Human Evolution
As the brain does not fossilize, and development itself cannot be directly observed 
in extinct species, it is difficult to determine exactly when the Homo sapiens pattern 
of prolonged brain development, with rapid early growth, emerged during hominin 
evolution. However, by examining the fossil record and the timing of genetic 
changes, some inferences can be made (DeSilva, Chap. 4, this volume).
3.3.1  Extinct Hominins
In two early species of hominins, Sahelanthropus tchadensis and Ardipithecus 
ramidus, adult endocranial volume was under 400 cc, within the range of present-­
day chimpanzees. Brain growth in these species was likely relatively conserved and 
similar to the pattern that would have been present in the last common ancestor of 
the Pan genus and hominins (Zollikofer & de León, 2013).
The earliest evidence of possible changes to the brain in hominin evolution has 
been demonstrated in Australopithecines. Adult Australopithecine endocranial vol-
ume (410–550 cc) is slightly larger than that of chimpanzees (approximately 380 cc) 
(Falk et  al., 2000). Estimated neonatal brain size in Australopithecines is also 
slightly larger than the average neonatal brain size in chimpanzees, 179.8 cc and 
L. Wilder and K. Semendeferi

49
145.7 cc, respectively. Based on these estimates, Australopithecines would have 
completed a slightly lower percentage of brain growth prenatally than chimpanzees, 
38% and 40% respectively (DeSilva & Lesnik, 2008). More direct evidence of brain 
ontogeny in Australopithecines comes from the endocasts of the Dikika child 
(Austalopithecus afarensis) and the Taung child (Austalopithecus africanus). The 
Dikika child, which dates to 3.3 million years ago, was approximately 3 years old at 
the time of death and had an estimated endocranial volume of 275-330 cc (Alemseged 
et al., 2006). The Taung child, dated to 2.5 million years ago, was approximately 
3–4  years old at the time of death, with an estimated endocranial volume of 
382–405 cc (Falk et al., 2000; Falk & Clarke, 2007). Relative to endocranial volume 
in adults of the same species, the values of both of these specimens fit within what 
would be expected for chimpanzees (Zollikofer & de León, 2013). Further evidence 
of brain ontogeny in the Taung child is found in its metopic suture, which had not 
completely fused at the time of death. In great apes, this occurs shortly after birth, 
while in Homo sapiens this suture fuses much later, possibly to accommodate a 
greater degree of brain growth. This delayed fusion of the metopic suture in the 
Taung child may indicate a higher rate of growth in the very early postnatal period 
in Australopithecines (Falk et al., 2012). Overall, brain growth in Australopithecines 
appears to be similar to that of chimpanzees, while possibly shifting very gradually 
to more prolonged postnatal growth, in the direction of the Homo sapiens growth 
pattern. Due to the limited number of juvenile fossils found from the various 
Australopithecine species, there is not enough evidence to conclusively identify a 
change from the ancestral pattern of brain growth.
Brain volume increased significantly in the Homo genus relative to earlier homi-
nins, with endocranial volumes of nearly all Homo habilis specimens being greater 
than 580 cc. Estimates based on adult endocranial volume and pelvis size suggest 
neonatal brain size in early Homo species (Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis) 
may have been approximately 225 cc, only 35% of average adult values (Falk et al., 
2000). The lack of any infant or young juvenile specimens from either of these spe-
cies makes these estimates somewhat speculative, however.
The earliest species in which brain growth trajectory has been thoroughly exam-
ined is Homo erectus, where there is evidence of a change in the rate of brain growth 
compared to chimpanzees and relative to earlier hominins. The skull cap of an infant 
Homo erectus was found in Mojokerto, Indonesia, and dated to 1.43–1.49 million 
years ago. The endocranial volume of the Mojokerto specimen is between 630 and 
660 cc, approximately 70% of the adult cranial capacity in Homo erectus from this 
time period (Balzeau et al., 2005). The individual was most likely younger than 
4 years of age at death and may have been as young as 0.5–1.5 years of age, although 
estimates of age range widely due to the lack of information on Homo erectus 
somatic growth (Coqueugniot et al., 2004). By 0.5–1.5 years of age, humans achieve 
an average of approximately 62% of their adult endocranial volume, while chim-
panzees reach approximately 80% by the same age (Fig. 3.2 above). These values 
suggest an intermediate pattern of postnatal brain growth in Homo erectus, falling 
somewhere between Homo sapiens-like growth and non-human ape-like growth 
(O’Connell & DeSilva, 2013). This is supported by simulated annual growth rates

of endocranial volume in Homo erectus, based on the Mojokerto specimen. These 
results suggest a rate of brain growth in Homo erectus that is on the lower end of the 
range of Homo sapiens growth from 0.5 to 1.5 years of age, falling below the human 
range after 2 years of age, and elevated above that of chimpanzees or gorillas for the 
entire period from 0.5 to 2 years of age (Cofran & DeSilva, 2015; Zollikofer & de 
León, 2010).
Rapid brain growth in the early postnatal period appears to have emerged at least 
1.8 million years ago with Homo erectus. The rapid growth period is even more 
prolonged in later hominins, Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens. In Homo 
neanderthalensis, this rate of growth was likely even greater than in Homo sapiens. 
This higher rate of growth resulted in a larger adult brain volume, despite a similar 
percentage of brain growth completed prenatally and a similar duration of brain 
growth (de León et al., 2008).
One feature of brain ontogeny that appears to be completely unique to Homo 
sapiens is globularization – developmental changes that result in a more rounded, 
globular braincase – that occurs in the perinatal, or immediate postnatal period. This 
postnatal change in brain shape is not seen in chimpanzees or in Homo neandertha-
lensis, likely only having evolved after Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis 
diverged. It is achieved through parietal lobe expansion, expansion of posterior cra-
nial fossa and basicranial flexion, which together result in a more rounded shape to 
the braincase (Neubauer et al., 2010). As this globularization takes place prior to 
complete ossification of the skull, while cranial sutures remain unfused, this change 
in the shape of the braincase is more likely the result of brain growth, suggesting 
possible subtle changes to the internal brain organization in early infancy that is 
unique to Homo sapiens (Neubauer et al., 2018).
3.3.2  Genetic Changes in the Human Lineage
There are many genes expressed in the brain that have undergone evolutionary mod-
ifications in the human lineage. Several of these genes, discussed here, have known 
functions that impact brain development and may contribute to the greater size and 
plasticity of the human brain.
The difference in brain size between humans and closely related non-human 
primates has been attributed to differences in the proliferative capacity of neural 
progenitors during prenatal development. A larger pool of progenitor cells can pro-
duce greater neuron numbers, resulting in a substantially larger brain (Rakic, 2000). 
ARHGAP11B, which arose through incomplete duplication of the ancestral 
ARHGAP11A approximately 5 million years ago, promotes the production of basal 
neural progenitors, which are responsible for the production of most cortical neu-
rons (Florio et al., 2016). Similarly, TBC1D3 has been duplicated in the human 
lineage, and there are multiple copies of this gene in humans, while there is only one 
copy in chimpanzees. Overexpression of this gene in mice increases the number of 
basal neural progenitor cells (Ju et  al., 2016). Partial duplication of NOTCH2 
L. Wilder and K. Semendeferi

51
resulted in the human-specific NOTCH2NLA, NOTCH2NLB, and NOTCH2NLC 
genes, which are all highly expressed in human radial glial cells. Overexpression of 
human NOTCH2NL in mice results in downregulation of genes involved in neuronal 
differentiation, suggesting a possible delay in the differentiation of neural progeni-
tor cells (Fiddes et al., 2018). Such delay would allow for more rounds of symmetric 
cell division and thus a larger pool of neural progenitors.
Not every alteration to the genome contributing to changes in brain size has been 
in protein-coding genes. The non-coding human accelerated HARE5 gene acts as a 
regulatory enhancer of FZD8. In comparison to chimpanzee HARE5, human 
HARE5-enhanced expression of FZD8 accelerates the neural progenitor cell cycle 
(Boyd et al., 2015). These genetic changes work together, promoting the production 
of neural progenitors, allowing them to divide more rapidly and for a longer period 
of time, producing a substantially larger pool of neural progenitors and therefore 
greater neuron numbers and a larger brain.
Genes contributing to neuronal and synaptic maturation have been altered over 
the course of human evolution as well. Of particular interest is the SRGAP2 gene, 
which has undergone three human-specific duplications to form SRGAP2B (3.4 mil-
lion years ago), SRGAP2C (2.4 million years ago), and SRGAP2D (1 million years 
ago) (Dennis et al., 2012). The ancestral form of SRGAP2, SRGAP2A is upregulated 
at the end of cortical migration and promotes synapse maturation. SRGAP2C inhib-
its the functions of SRGAP2A, delaying synapse maturation and extending spine 
production in excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons (Charrier et al., 2012; Fossati 
et al., 2016). This prolongs the period of cortical synaptogenesis in humans, and may 
underlie the extreme plasticity of the human brain during infancy and beyond.
3.4  Causes and Consequences of Brain Plasticity in Infancy
In the last 6–7 million years, since the split from the last common ancestor of 
humans and the Pan genus, brain size has more than tripled over the course of 
human evolution. This large brain has allowed humans to exploit a unique adaptive 
niche, becoming highly cultural and intelligent. The evolution of this large brain 
required developmental shifts, including a smaller relative brain at birth and more 
postnatal growth and development compared to non-human primates and earlier 
hominins. While energetically costly, these shifts to accommodate a larger brain 
resulted in increased neuroplasticity, along with the increased potential for pertur-
bations of development.
Human brain development is characterized by rapid growth prenatally and post-
natally, as well as prolonged neuronal maturation and synaptic refinement. This is 
most extreme in regions of the brain devoted to higher level cognitive processes, 
such as areas of the prefrontal cortex. These features underlie the extreme plasticity 
of the human brain in infancy. The brains of human infants have the capacity to be 
highly responsive to the environment during the development of critical cognitive 
and social skills, such as joint attention and language, ultimately allowing the emer-
gence of uniquely human cognition and behavior.

Childbirth and Infant Care in Early 
Human Ancestors: What the Bones Tell Us
Jeremy M. DeSilva
Humans are most closely related to chimpanzees and bonobos. Fossil and genetic 
evidence indicate the common ancestor we share with these African great apes lived 
~6 million years ago (Brunet et al., 2002; Chen & Li, 2001). Despite our close relat-
edness, childbirth and infant rearing strategies are quite different in humans com-
pared with our ape1 cousins (Trevathan, 2015; Nowell & Kurki, 2020). In 
chimpanzees, a mother typically gives birth by herself at night after a short labor. 
The baby’s head and shoulders have ample room progressing through a relatively 
spacious birth canal and the baby is typically born facing forward (occiput poste-
rior). After birth, the mother exclusively carries the infant and does not let another 
chimpanzee—even a related one—near her infant for months (van Lawick-Goodall, 
1967; Goodall, 1986). While juvenile apes can locomote on their own soon after 
birth, they rely heavily on their mothers for food and are not weaned until they are 
4–8 years old.
In stark contrast, birth in humans follows a long labor and involves a corkscrew-
ing motion of the neonatal head and shoulders through a relatively constrained birth 
canal. A human universal is the presence of helpers during birth, often in the form 
of experienced female midwives. After birth, alloparents abound and multiple care-
takers assist in various ways to help raise the infant (Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6; Hrdy 
& Burkhart, Chap. 8, this volume). In traditional hunter-gatherer societies, human 
mothers wean their offspring around the age of 2–3 years old (Konner, 2010), sig-
nificantly earlier than the weaning age in apes. In the pages that follow, I will

hominoids (ape), so throughout this paper I use the word “ape” as a substitute for nonhuman 
hominoids.

etal anatomy inform our understanding of the timing and circumstances behind our 
unique childbirth mechanics and infant rearing strategies.
4.1  The Evolution of Human Birth and the Problem 
with the Obstetrical Dilemma
The evolution of human birth is so often framed around the obstetrical dilemma 
hypothesis (see Dunsworth, 2016, 2018; Dunsworth & Eccleston, 2015) that is nec-
essary to start with this concept. The obstetrical dilemma is frequently pitched as a 
classic example of an evolutionary trade-off. In short, the human pelvis has altered 
its shape to maximize efficiency during bipedal travel. But the resulting reduction in 
the size of the birth canal makes birth more difficult and sometimes dangerous. It 
has been assumed that a more spacious birth canal would make birth easier and 
therefore selectively advantageous, but such a wide pelvis would compromise walk-
ing. Similarly, it has been assumed that a narrower pelvis would confer walking and 
running advantages but would make birth untenable. The outcome of this evolution-
ary trade-off is clear: women have been assumed to be less efficient walkers than 
men because of their wide pelvises shaped to permit the passage of large-brained, 
large-bodied infants. As brains increased in size during the Pleistocene, this evolu-
tionary problem became exacerbated. The solution, it was hypothesized, was for 
humans to give birth more easily to less developed, more helpless infants.
It is an elegant idea, embraced by scholarly and popular (e.g., Harari, 2014) writ-
ings alike. But recent experimental and comparative data testing the assumptions of 
this hypothesis have revealed it to be a deeply flawed idea in need of either complete 
abandonment (e.g., Dunsworth, 2016, 2018) or significant modification.
Before I dive into the recent literature on this topic, however, it is noteworthy to 
point out how much the obstetrical dilemma—as originally conceived—was built 
upon off-hand remarks, rather than on rigorously scrutinized data and empirically 
derived predictions. The term “obstetrical dilemma” was first used by University of 
California, Berkeley anthropologist Sherwood Washburn in a Scientific American 
article titled “Tools and Human Evolution.” As the title would imply, Washburn 
(1960) spent much of the article discussing the relationship between technological 
advances and anatomical and behavioral changes throughout human evolution. We 
are, after all, a biocultural primate. On page 74, he wrote,
In man adaptation to bipedal locomotion decreased the size of the bony birth-canal at the 
same time that the exigencies of tool use selected for larger brains. This obstetrical dilemma 
was solved by delivery of the fetus at a much earlier stage of development. But this was 
possible only because the mother, already bipedal and with hands free of locomotor neces-
sities, could hold the helpless, immature infant….. The slow-moving mother, carrying the 
baby, could not hunt, and the combination of the woman’s obligation to care for slow-­
developing babies and the man’s occupation of hunting imposed a fundamental pattern on 
the social organization of the human species.
J. M. DeSilva

Thousands of peer-reviewed pages, written by dozens of scholars, have been devoted 
to just a part of one of the 25 paragraphs written in a popular science piece by 
Washburn. I wonder how much thought he actually gave to an idea that would come 
to be so influential in our field and would even help boost the evolutionary justifica-
tion for the medicalization of childbirth (see Stone, 2016).
Nine years earlier, University of Pennsylvania anthropologist Wilton Krogman 
(1951) shared similar sentiments as Washburn’s in an article called “Scars of Human 
Evolution,” which also appeared in Scientific American. He wrote,
We have expanded our brain case tremendously, and there can be no doubt that many of the 
obstetrical problems of Mrs. H. Sapiens are due to the combination of a narrower pelvis and 
a bigger head in the species. How long it will take to balance that ratio we have no idea. It 
seems reasonable to assume that the human head will not materially shrink in size, so the 
adjustment will have to be in the pelvis; i.e., evolution should favor women with a broad, 
roomy pelvis.
The empirical basis for these observations can be traced to published work by 
Swiss anthropologist Adolph Schultz (1949) whose comparative study of dimor-
phism in the primate pelvis led him to conclude that the “widening of the female 
pelvis represents a vital adaptation to the requirements of parturition….” He noted 
that this was true in “monkeys as it is in man,” though he also pointed out that the 
reduced anteroposterior dimension of the pelvic inlet was unique to humans.
Let’s return to Washburn’s original words and unpack the “obstetrical dilemma.” 
Washburn began with the statement that, “In man adaptation to bipedal locomotion 
decreased the size of the bony birth-canal at the same time that the exigencies of 
tool use selected for larger brains.”
The first part of this sentence—that a reduced bony birth-canal is associated with 
bipedal locomotion—is supported by fossil and comparative skeletal data. Some of 
the first changes related to bipedal locomotion happened in the pelvis, as evidenced 
by the 4.4 Ma Ardipithecus ramidus partial skeleton (Kozma et al., 2018; Lovejoy 
et al., 2009; White et al., 2015). These changes are even more obvious in the fossil 
pelvises from 2–3.6  Ma Australopithecus (Haile-Selassie et  al., 2010; Lovejoy, 
2005; Robinson, 1972). The second part of this sentence—that bipedal locomotion 
evolved concurrently with tool use and encephalization, an idea also promoted by 
Charles Darwin (1871)—is not consistent with the human fossil record. The earliest 
evidence for at least occasional terrestrial bipedal locomotion in our hominin ances-
tors goes back 6  million years (Pickford et  al., 2002) and perhaps even earlier 
(Brunet et al., 2002), whereas evidence for habitual terrestrial bipedalism in the 
form of human-like footprints at Laetoli, Tanzania is 3.6 million years old (Day & 
Wickens, 1980). The earliest evidence for stone tools is between 2.6 million (Semaw 
et al. 2003) and 3.3 million years old (Harmand et al., 2015). However, the oldest 
fossil with a brain size substantially larger than the 450  cc averaged by 
Australopithecus is the 2.03 Ma KNM-ER 1470 Homo skull (Holloway et al., 2002; 
McDougall et al., 2012). Thus, with the evidence we currently have, there is tempo-
ral discordance between bipedalism, tool use, and encephalization.
Washburn writes next that, “This obstetrical dilemma was solved by delivery of 
the fetus at a much earlier stage of development.” This is a major crux of the 
4  Childbirth and Infant Care in Early Human Ancestors: What the Bones Tell Us

62
obstetrical dilemma—that humans are born prematurely and that explains their rela-
tive helplessness at birth. Portmann (1944) proposed that the early arrival of our 
infants resulted in an “extrauterine spring” in which development that happened in 
utero in other primates occurred outside the womb in humans. But is it true that 
human infants are born earlier than expected? Dunsworth et al. (2012) tested this 
prediction of the obstetrical dilemma and found that human gestation length is not 
shorter than expected for a primate of our size; it is slightly longer. Her team hypoth-
esized that energetics, rather than constraints from the bony pelvis, drive the timing 
of mammalian birth, including humans, an idea termed the energetic of gestation 
and fetal growth (EGG) hypothesis. If human babies are not born prematurely, what 
explains the relative helplessness of our infants?
Infant mammals have often been dichotomized as altricial or precocial (terms 
derived from the avian literature [Portmann, 1939]). Altricial mammals are typi-
cally born hairless, eyes closed, and unable to locomote. Newborn bears or mice, for 
instance, are altricial. Alternatively, some newborns are alert and able to move 
immediately—or soon after—birth. These so-called precocial infants include seals, 
most bats, and artiodactyls. Primates fall into this latter category. They are born with 
a furry covering, eyes open, and with the ability to cling to their mothers soon after 
birth. The one exception, it has been said, are humans whose infants have been 
called “secondarily altricial” (Portmann, 1944).
While mammalian development is better treated as a continuum rather than 
existing within these discrete altricial or precocial categories, relative brain devel-
opment—or what has been called the “advancement factor” (Sacher & Staffeldt, 
1974)—appears to be an anatomical correlate to this developmental spectrum. The 
advancement factor is the percentage of adult brain volume grown by the time of the 
infant’s birth. At the two extremes are bears and seals, animals in the carnivore fam-
ily but with divergent strategies of infant development. Brown bear (Ursus arctos) 
infants are helpless at birth and possess only 1.7% of their adult brain volume at the 
birth, whereas harp seals (Phoca groenlandia) already have grown 88% of their 
adult brain volume and are able to swim alongside their mothers immediately after 
birth. In fact, mammals categorized as altricial have on average 15% of their adult 
brain volume present at the time of their birth whereas mammals categorized as 
precocial have on average 45%. Consistent with their precocial nature at birth, pri-
mates have an average advancement factor of 47% (DeSilva, 2016). Humans have 
an advancement factor of 28%, almost exactly between the altricial and precocial 
averages (DeSilva & Lesnik, 2006). It follows, then, that they are not easily catego-
rized as precocial or altricial (Trevathan & Rosenberg, 2016).
However, the relationship between brain advancement factor and infant helpless-
ness is complicated by how brains scale during development. There exists a strong 
linear relationship between the size of the brain at birth and the size of the adult 
brain in catarrhine primates (DeSilva & Lesnik, 2008). While humans are unusual 
in possessing large-brained and large-bodied infants compared with the size of the 
mother’s body, human infants are born with a brain sized as one would predict given 
our average adult brain size. However, the slope of the line describing the relation-
ship between adult and neonatal brain size in catarrhine primates is less than one 
J. M. DeSilva

63
(m = 0.77), meaning that as adult brain size increases in monkeys and apes, infant 
brain size is proportionately less, and necessarily so. The advancement factor of 
monkeys is around 50%, apes 40%, and modern humans 28% (DeSilva & 
Lesnik, 2008).
As human brain size increased throughout the Pleistocene, less and less of the 
adult brain volume would have been completed by birth, meaning that infants would 
have become more and more helpless even as their absolute brains increased 
(DeSilva, 2016). Today, while human babies are alert and responsive to facial 
expressions and various other stimuli in their environment, they remain relatively 
helpless and immobile and not only require considerable maternal care but benefit 
from the assistance of others in the group (Hrdy, 2009; Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6; 
Hrdy & Burkhart, Chap. 8, this volume). But this happens not because they are born 
early (they are not), but because of the scaling relationship between adult and neo-
natal brain size in primates and our relatively large brains.
Washburn’s final observation about the “slow-moving mother” is similarly prob-
lematic. Data collected from modern human hunter-gatherers reveal that women 
cover an average of 6 miles a day (Marlowe, 2005). But do women cover these miles 
less efficiently than men? Warrener et al. (2015) tested this hypothesis and found 
that contrary to the predictions of the obstetrical dilemma, individuals with wider 
hips do not use more energy than those with narrower hips. In fact, Wall-Scheffler 
(2012) and Wall-Scheffler & Myers (2007) have repeatedly found that individuals—
typically women—with wider hips are more efficient walkers when they are carry-
ing objects. Furthermore, they experience less of an energetic cost when changing 
speeds. Thus, not only are there not costs to having wide hips, there appear to be 
biomechanical benefits when doing what people do when they travel: carry objects 
and alter their pace. In general, individuals (typically women) with mediolaterally 
wide hips also have more transverse plane rotation during walking which function-
ally increases stride length (Gruss et  al., 2017; Wall-Scheffler & Myers, 2017; 
Whitcome et al., 2017). Thus, while the kinematics of walking differ between the 
average man and average woman, there is energetic equivalence.
Many of the assumptions generated from the obstetrical dilemma are predicated 
on the idea that humans have evolved mediolaterally narrow hips for efficient 
bipedal locomotion. But that assumption may also be in error (Fig. 4.1). Krogman 
(1951) referred to the “narrower” human pelvis, but only after pointing out that the 
major difference between our pelvis and that of other mammals was the lowering of 
the sacrum, such that “the sacrum now encroaches upon the pelvic cavity and nar-
rows the birth canal that must pass the fetus along to life.” In other words, Krogman 
did not emphasize the side-to-side narrowing of the human pelvis, but the front-to-­
back shortening of it. Similarly, Schultz (1949) remarked on the anteroposteriorly 
narrow pelvis in humans.
In fact, relative to body mass, humans do not have unusually narrow (side-to-­
side) pelvises at all. They have, more or less, the expected biiliac breadth, biacetabu-
lar breadth, and mediolateral width of the pelvic inlet for a primate of our size. The 
only side-to-side dimension in which humans have a difference of note from our 
primate cousins is in the wider bispinous breadth (Fig. 4.2). The limiting dimension 
4  Childbirth and Infant Care in Early Human Ancestors: What the Bones Tell Us

64
of the birth canal—and thus the narrowest dimension that an infant must pass 
through during parturition—is here: the mediolateral width of the midplane, or 
bispinous breadth. However, the bispinous breadth does not correlate in humans 
with biiliac breadth, meaning that this often-used anatomical correlate with the 
unfortunate but often used expression “childbearing hips” has little to do with the 
dimensions that would actually impact the birth process.
Humans, therefore, do not have narrow (side-to-side) hips. Nor have we ever

The dimension, then, that needs more consideration is the narrowing of the pelvis in 
the sagittal plane, where humans (and human ancestors) have evolved a reduced 
distance between the sacroiliac joint and the acetabulum, a presumed bipedal adap-
tation that lowers the center of mass and reduces bending forces through the ilium. 
It is here where future hypotheses testing the “obstetrical dilemma” should be gen-
erated (DeSilva et al., 2017).
While female gait kinematics are affected—but not compromised—by differ-
ences in pelvic shape, there remains the reality of maternal mortality. Washburn 
(1960), Krogman (1951), and Schultz (1949) never explicitly discussed the danger 
of childbirth and maternal mortality rates. However, for many, the “obstetrical 
dilemma” has come to encompass not just infant helplessness but the relative diffi-
culty and sometimes danger of childbirth. Every woman who gives birth has her 
own unique experience—a product of many variables from fetal head size, shoulder 
width, pelvic dimensions, gestation length, and ligament relaxation to cranial mold-
ing, stress hormones, birth position, social support, and the advice and approach of 
the attending midwife or obstetrician. But it remains a fact that 300,000 women and 
nearly one million babies die annually in childbirth (WHO, 2019). For the mother, 
hemorrhage or infection are the primary causes. Countries where these death rates 
are the highest are usually the poorest and ones in which women have the fewest

Notice that humans (star) have biiliac and biacetabular measurements near to the predict values for 
a primate of our size whereas the bispinous breadth is slightly larger than expected. Where humans 
differ, and therefore have a “narrow” pelvis is in the AP (anteroposterior) dimension of the pel-
vic inlet

reproductive rights. Systemic institutional racism in the United States makes women 
of color three times more likely to die in childbirth than white women (Petersen 
et al., 2019).
Because just a slight increase in linear dimensions of the pelvis would have a 
marked increase in the area of the birth canal and volume of the fetal cranium deliv-
erable (Epstein, 1973) and because such an increase would not compromise loco-
motion (Warrener et al., 2015, Warrener, 2017, but see Ruff, 1995, 2017), one may 
wonder why the pelvis is not more spacious.
This remains an open question. Some have hypothesized that the high rate of 
maternal mortality is a relatively recent phenomenon, rare in the archaeological 
record, exacerbated by a simple sugar diet that stunts pelvic growth while simulta-
neously leading to macrosomatic infants—a combination that could result in a 
higher frequency of cephalopelvic disproportion and birth complications (Wells, 
2017; Wells et al., 2012). In a cross-sectional study of pelvic growth, Huseynov 
et al. (2016) identified developmental changes to the female pelvis in which the 
limiting dimensions of the birth canal—the anteroposterior length of the pelvic inlet 
and the width of the midplane—continue to grow through the age of 20  years. 
Countries—including ones with child bride practices—in which the average age of 
marriage is <20 years-old—have an average maternal mortality rate of 1 in every 
200 live births, nearly eight times greater than the average maternal mortality in 
countries where the average marriage age is >20 years (DeSilva, 2021). Others have 
hypothesized that because a narrow pelvis is more efficient at dispersing body heat 
and Homo sapiens evolved in equatorial Africa, then the real obstetrical dilemma is 
a trade-off between safely birthing an infant and efficiently regulating body tem-
perature (see Ruff, 1991; Gruss & Schmitt, 2015). Still, others have focused specifi-
cally on the bottleneck point of the human birth canal (bispinous breadth) and have 
hypothesized that widening this region would increase the risk of debilitating pelvic 
prolapse (Huseynov et al., 2016; Trevathan, 2015). These hypotheses—and oth-
ers—will require rigorous scientific testing in the coming years.
4.2  What Was Birth Like in Our Ancestors?
Reconstructing birth evolution on the basis of fossil remains relies on our ability to 
identify osteological female hominins from their pelvic anatomy. This has proven to 
be difficult, as the standard forensic observations used to distinguish osteological 
male and female pelvises do not always translate to early hominin fossils. Early 
hominins, for instance, tend to have a wider sciatic notch than modern humans, 
making many fossils appear female on the basis of this one trait (Simpson et al., 
2014). Taking this into consideration, many of the “female” fossil pelvises used to 
characterize birth evolution in early hominins have been identified by some scholars 
as male. “Lucy” (A.L. 288-1) is an osteological female to most scholars (e.g., Tague 
& Lovejoy, 1986, 1998) but male to another team (Häusler & Schmid, 1995). 
Australopithecus africanus pelves Sts 14 and Sts 65 are identified as female by 
some researchers (e.g., Berge & Goularas, 2010; Claxton et  al., 2016) and 
J. M. DeSilva

67
osteological males by others (e.g., Gommery & Thackeray, 2006; Robinson, 1972; 
Häusler & Ruff, 2020). Later Homo pelvises are similarly contentious, with some 
identifying OH 28 and KNM-ER 1808 as osteological females (Walker & Ruff, 
1993) and others as osteological males (McHenry, 1991; Simpson et  al., 2008; 
Simpson et al., 2014). The BSN49/P29 pelvis is identified by Simpson et al. (2008, 
2014) as a female Homo erectus while Ruff (2010) argues that the acetabulum is too 
small for this specimen to be from the genus Homo and instead hypothesized that it 
belonged to a robust Australopithecus. It seems the only pelvis in which researchers 
unanimously agree on the taxonomy and the osteological sex is the KNM-WT 
15000 Homo erectus fossil. However, because it belonged to a juvenile male, its 
utility in reconstructing birth mechanics in early hominins is questionable despite 
admirable attempts (Walker & Ruff, 1993).
Furthermore, it is important to note that the pelvis is a thin, easily damaged, and 
distorted bone. Because of its fragility, fossil pelvic remains are rare and often frag-
mentary, requiring extensive reconstruction (e.g., Lovejoy et  al., 2009 for the 
Ardipithecus ramidus pelvis). This fact has naturally led to different researchers 
reassembling these pelvic remains in slightly different ways, resulting in slightly 
different reconstructions. For example, despite its relative completeness, two recon-
structions of the “Lucy” A.L. 288-1 pelvis (Häusler & Schmid, 1995; Tague & 
Lovejoy, 1986) differ enough to produce different dimensions of the birth canal. 
Despite these challenges, paleoanthropologists have pressed on and have been able 
to use the precious few pelvic remains thus far recovered to generalize birth mechan-
ics throughout human evolution.
4.2.1  Birth in the Last Common Ancestor of Humans 
and African Great Apes
As our closest living ape relatives, chimpanzees are often used as a substitute for the 
last common ancestor we shared with them. That is not to say that chimpanzees are 
time-machines—they, too, have evolved. But it remains instructive to compare birth 
in humans to the equivalent event in chimpanzees. Chimpanzee gestation averages 
32 weeks compared with the average of 39–40 weeks in modern humans (Dunsworth 
et al., 2012). In the wild, chimpanzees typically give birth at night, in a tree, alone. 
Human birth, while variable, is typically a social event in which experienced female 
midwives assist with the delivery (see Trevathan, 1987, 1988, 2010). While wild 
chimpanzee births are rarely observed, researchers have witnessed and character-
ized births in captivity. Labor averages 2 h and the baby is usually born facing for-
ward (occiput posterior), though occiput anterior births have also been observed 
(Elder & Yerkes, 1936; Hirata et al., 2011). Cephalopelvic indices (ratio of the fetal 
head to birth canal dimensions) are low in chimpanzees and there is no evidence for 
the kind of fetal rotation that characterizes most human births.
Thus, compared with chimpanzees, human birth differs in three important ways: 
(1) human cephalopelvic indices are much higher than in chimpanzees; (2) human 
4  Childbirth and Infant Care in Early Human Ancestors: What the Bones Tell Us

68
infants typically rotate through the birth canal and are more often born occiput ante-
rior; and (3) human birth is a social event. Biological anthropologists have sought to 
identify the evolutionary timing and causes of these three distinct aspects of human 
birth. But that may not be necessary.
Our other closest living ape relative, the other member of the genus Pan, is the 
bonobo (Pan paniscus). While cephalopelvic indices in the bonobo are similar to 
that found in chimpanzees and while the birth mechanism appears to be similar 
between the two ape species, the social nature of these animals differs tremendously. 
Bonobos are less aggressive than chimpanzees and less territorial. They are curious, 
cooperative, tolerant, and trusting (see Hare & Woods, 2020). Researchers have 
observed both captive and wild bonobo females present during the birth of an infant 
(Demuru et al., 2018; Douglas, 2014). While still unclear, it is possible that the last 
common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and bonobos had social assistance dur-
ing birth and that chimpanzees are the species that have undergone an evolutionary 
change in which a once social ancestor became more wary and cautious during 
delivery, leading eventually to solitary birthing practices. If this proves to be true, 
then the presence of helpers during birth may have preceded the onset of rotational 
birth in humans. Instead of rotational birth leading to the necessity of helpers during 
delivery, the presence of these helpers made rotational birth a feasible option as the 
pelvis changed shaped in early bipedal hominins.
The emphasis here is on rotational birth because humans are also not unique in 
having a high cephalopelvic index. This is also the case for many monkey species 
(Moffett, 2017; Ponce de León & Zollikofer, 2016; Schultz, 1949; Stoller, 1995; 
Trevathan, 2015), and it is possible that birth in the last common ancestor of the 
African apes had a more challenging birth than modern great apes do. There is no 
fossil pelvis known from the time of the last common ancestor of the African great 
apes (~6–9 million years ago). However, a recently described pelvis from a ~10 
million-year-old ape from Hungary known as Rudapithecus has a morphology simi-
lar in many ways to that found in hylobatids (gibbons and siamangs) (Ward et al., 
2019). If Rudapithecus is related to the last common ancestor of the African great 
apes, then both humans and the African great apes would have experienced diver-
gent pelvic evolution from something more hylobatid-like. Interestingly, hylobatids 
have a higher cephalopelvic index than other apes (Moffett, 2017; Zollikofer et al., 
2017). But whether this means that the last common ancestor of humans and chim-
panzees had a high cephalopelvic index or a low one and whether the birth was 
social or not, only humans experience rotational birth. The question, then, is when 
did that evolve? And why?
4.2.2  Birth in Early Hominins (Ardipithecus 
and Australopithecus)
While a reconstruction of birth in Ardipithecus ramidus has not yet been published, 
images of the reconstructed pelvis of the ARA-VP-6/500 skeleton (see Fig. 4 in 
Hogervorst & Vereecke, 2014) indicate that “Ardi” had a more ape-like 
J. M. DeSilva

69
anteroposteriorly expanded birth canal and would have birthed a small-brained, 
small-bodied (DeSilva, 2011) infant through the birth canal without any rotation. 
This scenario changes with the evolution of Australopithecus.
In all non-human primates, the long axis of the neonatal head (occipitofrontal) 
aligns with the widest part of the birth canal (anteroposterior) and birth proceeds 
without the infant having to rotate. However, this is not the case with humans, 
whose infants rotate as they descend into the birth canal and meet the pelvic brim to 
align the occipitofrontal axis of the skull with the mediolateral, or transverse plane. 
Thus, the reduction of the AP inlet—a consequence of the reduction of the distance 
between the sacroiliac and hip joints—necessarily changes how a baby enters the 
birth canal. This shape change in the hominin pelvis is present in fossils of 
Australopithecus, including A.L. 288-1 (Lucy, A. afarensis), Sts 14 and Sts 65 
(A. africanus), and MH2 (A. sediba) (Claxton et al., 2016). Thus, a form of rota-
tional birth can be traced back to at least 3.18 million years ago—the age of the 
Lucy partial skeleton (Fig. 4.3).
Tague and Lovejoy (1986) hypothesized that Lucy’s infant would have entered 
the birth canal with its head transversely oriented and carried on through the birth 
canal in this manner, its head aligned through the platypelloid inlet and midplane, 
before it tilted its head under the pubic symphysis in a presentation known as asyn-
clitic birth. Tague and Lovejoy (1986) relied on the geometry of the A.L. 288-1 
pelvis and a chimpanzee neonatal cranium as a fill-in for a baby Australopithecus to 
reconstruct this form of birth, which would not have required helpers or midwives. 
However, Trevathan and Rosenberg (2000) pointed out that Tague and Lovejoy 
(1986) and others who have attempted birth reconstructions from fossil remains did 
not consider a key variable that influences, and sometimes impinges on, the birth 
process: shoulders.
In 2017, we incorporated estimates of neonatal shoulder breadth in an attempt at 
a new reconstruction of birth in Lucy and found that because the head and shoulders 
are orthogonal, rotation probably would have to continue beyond the inlet during 
delivery in A. afarensis (Fig. 4.4; DeSilva et al., 2017). In fact, the infant would have 
to corkscrew through the inlet and the midplane, nearly completing a human-like 
rotation. On the basis of this reconstruction, we hypothesized that the infant was 
born close enough to occiput anterior, it would have been selectively advantageous 
for A. afarensis to have helpers. Thus, as Rosenberg and Trevathan have suggested, 
midwifery is indeed the oldest human profession (Rosenberg, 1992; Rosenberg & 
Trevathan, 1995, 2001, 2002; Trevathan, 1987).
While birth reconstructions in other hominins have been contentious, other schol-
ars have also hypothesized that Australopithecus experienced some form of rota-
tional birth (Berge et al., 1984; Berge & Goularas, 2010; Häusler & Schmid, 1995). 
Interestingly, using the same approach that we used on the Lucy pelvis on a later 
Australopithecus—A. sediba—we found that the geometry of the pelvis and the size 
of the neonate cranium and shoulders was such that full rotation was not required and 
that birth may have been more similar to the asynclitic form Tague and Lovejoy 
(1986) hypothesized for Lucy (Laudicina et al., 2019). While rotational birth was 
still possible—and perhaps even likely—our findings indicated that there was enough 
variation in pelvic form in Australopithecus that it would be a mistake to assume that 
4  Childbirth and Infant Care in Early Human Ancestors: What the Bones Tell Us

70
every species in the genus, or every individual in the species, gave birth in the same 
way (Laudicina et al., 2019). Of course, that is true for humans as well, who exhibit 
considerable variation in delivery presentations (Walrath et al., 2003).
The only adult pelvis of an early member of our own genus Homo complete 
enough to infer the birth mechanism is from a female H. erectus pelvis recovered in 
the Gona region of Ethiopia (Simpson et al., 2008). It is platypelloid, like some 
pelvises from Australopithecus. However, it also is anteroposteriorly expanded rela-
tive to earlier hominin pelvises. Interestingly, its anteroposterior expansion is such 
that it is 8% larger than the biparietal breadth of a hypothetical newborn—the same 
as what is found in Australopithecus (calculated from adult cranial capacity; see 
DeSilva & Lesnik, 2008). In fact, there is remarkable conservation of female pelvis 
anteroposterior inlet breadth:neonatal biparietal width proportions from 
Australopithecus through to modern-day humans. These data are consistent with 
Fig. 4.3  Colored ovals represent the size of the neonatal skull and the black halo represents the 
size of the average female pelvic inlet in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), humans (Homo sapiens), 
and fossil hominins (accession numbers listed below each). Notice that the chimpanzee neonatal 
head fits the pelvic inlet in an anteroposterior orientation. However, a human or ancient hominin 
neonate could not pass its head into the birth canal in this orientation (left circles). To the right are 
the same representations; however, the human and ancient hominin neonatal crania have been 
rotated so that they enter the birth canal transversely. Thus, the beginnings of human rotational 
birth are at least 3.2 million-years-old. Bottom: cephalopelvic index is reported here as a ratio of 
the anteroposterior length of the pelvic brim to the biparietal breadth of the neonatal cranium. 
Notice that this ratio has remained relatively unchanged for the last 3 million years, implying a 
tight correlation between brain size and this dimension of the female pelvis throughout human 
evolution

Fig. 4.4  Birth in chimpanzees (far left) is a relatively simple process in which the neonatal cra-
nium passes unobscured through the inlet (IN), midplane (MP), and outlet (OUT) without rotation. 
In humans (far right), the neonate rotates, and its head enters the birth canal obliquely or trans-
versely (top). At the midplane, the head rotates again to align the narrow biparietal breadth with the 
narrow bispinous width. The head is in occiput anterior position. A final twist is needed (bottom) 
to pass the shoulders under the pubis. Middle: In Australopithecus afarensis, the neonate must 
have rotated and entered the birth canal transversely. However, the wide shoulders (biacromial 
breadth) required additional rotation at the midplane and outlet such that the infant almost pre-
sented as occiput anterior and likely required helpers during delivery. Drawing courtesy of

72
recent findings for intraspecific covariation between cranial capacity and pelvic 
dimensions in modern women (Fischer & Mitteroecker, 2015) and suggest tight 
selective control over the anteroposterior dimensions of the pelvic inlet. This trend 
continues through Neandertals, whose birth mechanism has been reconstructed as 
either human-like (Ponce de León et al., 2008) or non-rotational (Weaver & Hublin, 
2009). More complete female Neandertal fossil pelvises are sorely needed to resolve 
this question.
4.3  Brain Development in Early Hominins
Humans have extraordinarily large brains for a mammal of our size. The human 
fossil record documents brain enlargement from early hominins with brains no 
larger than a modern chimpanzee, through Australopithecus (20% increase in brain 
volume), to Homo in which brains evolved from an average of 500 cc to around 
1400 cc (Fig. 4.5; Wilder & Semendeferi, Chap. 3, this volume). Brain evolution, 
however, was not linear and progressive, as small-brained hominins H. floresiensis 
and H. naledi persisted late into the Pleistocene (Falk et al., 2005; Holloway et al., 
2018) and human brains today are, on average, 15% smaller than they were in our 
late Pleistocene ancestors (Hawks, 2011). Nonetheless, compared with our closest 
living ape relatives, humans have brains that are over three times larger in volume.
Developmentally, it is known that humans grow their brains for a longer period 
of time and grow their brains at a faster rate (Leigh, 2004; Wilder & Semendeferi, 
Chap. 3, this volume). In other words, humans add more brain tissue per year for 
more years than chimpanzees do. But did this evolutionary change happen in lock-
step? The answer appears to be no.
Hominin fossils are rare; even rarer are fossils of juveniles whose thin, fragile 
bones infrequently preserve. However, four early hominin juvenile crania help piece 
together brain growth and development in our early ancestors. There are two >3 
million-year-old juvenile crania from Australopithecus afarensis: A.L. 333–105 and 
the Dikika Child (Alemseged et al., 2006). Both individuals died at the approximate 
age of 2  years, 5  months (Gunz et  al., 2020). The Taung Child is the first 
Australopithecus fossil ever discovered (Dart, 1925) and represents a roughly 
4-year-old of the about 2.5 million-year-old A. africanus (Lacruz et  al., 2005). 
Finally, there is a young Homo erectus from the ~1.5 million-year-old site of 
Mojokerto in Java, Indonesia representing a roughly 1-year-old individual 
(Coqueugniot et al., 2004; Cofran & DeSilva, 2015).
Gunz et al.’s (2020) virtual reconstruction of the Dikika Child’s cranium yielded 
a cranial capacity of 275 ml, while the A.L. 333-105 specimen is a slightly larger 
310–317 ml. Compared with the average adult A. afarensis brain, Gunz et al. (2020) 
found that A. afarensis juveniles had completed between 62 and 70% of their brain 
growth by the age of 2 years and 5 months. Chimpanzees of this developmental age 
already have 90% of their adult brain growth complete. Thus, A. afarensis appears 
to have grown their brains more slowly than modern apes do, more in line with the 
J. M. DeSilva

73
developmental pattern of modern humans (Fig. 4.6). In order to achieve the adult 
brain size of ~450 ml, A. afarensis juveniles must have grown their brains for a 
longer period of time, implying that they were reliant on adult caretakers for longer 
and may have been buffered against predation at this vulnerable time in their lives 
by parents and alloparents alike (Gunz et al., 2020).
Interestingly, the South African australopith A. africanus appears to have taken a 
different developmental strategy and was more ape-like, growing its brain more 
rapidly and achieving adult brain capacity earlier than A. afarensis (see Cofran, 
2019; McCarthy & Zimel, 2020). Brains are energetically expensive to grow, espe-
cially in juveniles (e.g., Kuzawa et al., 2014). A. afarensis may have evolved pro-
longed brain growth not only because it allowed the juveniles to learn for longer, but 
because it spread the energetic cost of encephalization over a longer period of time. 
In other words, even though A. afarensis had larger brains than modern apes, they 
added less brain tissue per year and therefore allocated less energy to brain growth 
annually (Cofran, 2019), because they grew them for longer. This changed with 
Homo erectus. The Mojokerto child had grown ~70% of its adult brain growth by 
the time of its death (Leigh, 2006; O’Connell & DeSilva, 2013; but see Coqueugniot 
et al., 2004). But to achieve this size from birth and to continue to grow the brain to

Ardipithecus). Notice that Australopithecus possessed brains that were ~20% larger than the aver-
age chimpanzee (shown as the bottom dotted line). Around 2.0 million years ago, brains began to 
enlarge in the genus Homo (white dots) and continued to enlarge throughout the Pleistocene. 
However, not all Homo taxa were encephalized. The four dots in the bottom right corner represent

74
the adult volume of H. erectus, considerably more energy would be required (Cofran 
& DeSilva, 2015). This increased energetic burden on female H. erectus could be 
mitigated through food sharing, expansion of dietary breadth, and cooking.
4.4  Weaning Age in Early Hominins
Compared with our ape relatives, humans are characterized by an extended life his-
tory. We have a longer gestation, longer childhoods, and longer lifespans. We grow 
our brains for a longer period of time, take longer to erupt our permanent teeth, and 
take many more years to grow to our full body size. The exception to this general 
trend is weaning time. While apes nurse their infants for 4–8 years (Knott, 2001), 
humans buck the general trend of having an elongated life history by wean earlier 
than other apes. Modern human hunter-gatherers average a weaning age of 2–3 years 
(Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6; Hrdy & Burkhart, Chap. 8, this volume).
While nursing an infant, an ape mother does not acquire enough energy to simul-
taneously gestate another baby—a concept known as lactational amenorrhea. 
However, at the cessation of nursing, ovulation resumes. If humans wean earlier, it 
means that we can—technically—have more offspring than a non-human ape. But 
Fig. 4.6  Brain development in humans (bottom labeled), chimpanzees (top labeled), and 
Australopithecus afarensis (vertical line labeled) as represented by the Dikika Child (virtual recon-
struction of fossil shown). Notice that the percentage of adult brain size is achieved rapidly in 
chimpanzees such that the top dotted line is near 100% by the age of ~3 years-old. In human, 
however, adult brain size is not achieved until ~7 years of age. Even though Australopithecus had 
small brains, they grew them slowly and had only reached ~70% of adult brain size by the age of 
2 years and 5 months (the age at death of the Dikika child and another fossil, A.L. 333-105). Such 
slowed brain development implies the presence of committed caretakers for a longer period of time 
in Australopithecus than in modern apes

75
when did this demographic shift happen in our evolutionary history? Some have 
argued early on, at the origins of the lineage (Lovejoy, 1981, 2009). Furthermore, a 
weaned 2–3-year-old human is not independent and requires care from multiple 
members of the group. Thus, understanding the weaning age has implications for 
reconstructing the social structure of early humans and for identifying the timing 
and circumstances behind the evolution of humans as cooperative breeders (Hrdy, 
2009; Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6; Hrdy & Burkhart, Chap. 8, this volume). But iden-
tifying weaning age from fossils has been challenging (see Smith, 2013, 2018).
Aiello et al. (1991) examined tooth wear on hominin fossils in which the first per-
manent molar had erupted. These included LH 2, a 3.6 million-year-old mandible 
from Australopithecus afarensis and Taung Child, a 2.5 million-year-old fossil from 
Australopithecus africanus. They noticed that the deciduous molars on the LH 2 spec-
imen were relatively unworn, similar to the condition of a nursing great ape of the 
same developmental age. The Taung Child, however, had very worn deciduous molars, 
which could be interpreted as evidence that this young hominin had been weaned for 
some time and had relied on solid foods that eroded its enamel. Similar wear of the 
deciduous molars can be found on other juvenile A. africanus fossils Sts 24 and StW 
59 and on the taxonomically ambiguous StW 151. Smith (2018) cautioned, however, 
that the introduction of solids does not correspond to tooth wear in chimpanzees. 
Individual variation, differences in diet and environment, and even dental develop-
mental schedules could impact the results and render a simple tooth-wear-to-weaning 
conversion unreliable. The solution, it turns out, can be found in isotopes.
Smith et al. (2017) demonstrated that the concentration of barium accurately tracks 
the onset of nursing and the introduction of solids into the diet of infants in both 
macaques and orangutans. This approach—along with the quantification of calcium 
and lithium isotopes—has permitted researchers to characterize weaning behavior in 
early hominins. Thus far, all of the examined hominins introduced solids early, a pat-
tern more similar to what is found in modern humans than the extended nursing prac-
ticed by modern apes. Fossils from Australopithecus africanus (Joannes-Boyau et al., 
2019; Tacail et al., 2019) and Paranthropus robustus (Tacail et al., 2019) suggest that 
these hominins nursed for only their first year of life before being introduced to solids. 
Barium levels in the teeth of Neanderthal infants (Austin et al., 2013; Smith et al., 
2018) demonstrate that solids were introduced by ~2.5 years of age, similar to weaning 
times in modern human hunter-­gatherers. These data are consistent with a shorter, 
more human-like, interbirth interval in fossil hominins, a reproductive strategy made 
possible by the presence of alloparents.
4.5  Conclusion
The job of a paleoanthropologist is to squeeze as much information out of rare fos-
sils as reliably possible to help reconstruct the evolutionary history of the human 
lineage. As this chapter hopefully communicates, fossil pelvises and juvenile skulls 
are rare, but clever techniques have been employed to infer birth practices, brain

development, and even weaning age in our ancestors. The evidence we currently 
have reveals that pelvic changes associated with bipedal locomotion changed how 
we give birth early in our evolutionary history making it likely that Australopithecus 
females assisted one another during delivery as far back as 3.2 million years ago.
This assistance continued after delivery (Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6; Hrdy & 
Burkart, Chap. 8, this volume). Bipedalism changes the orientation of the body in 
hominins such that an infant cannot simply ride on its mother’s back as happens in 
chimpanzees. An early hominin mother needing to forage or to climb a tree for food 
or safety would benefit from the help of others in the group, making alloparenting 
and shared parental care part of the behavioral repertoire of Plio-Pleistocene homi-
nins (see DeSilva, 2011; Stutz, 2014). Changes made possible by the presence of 
alloparents—detectable in the skulls and teeth of our ancestors—are slowed brain 
growth and early weaning. Thus, the “it takes a village” adage has deep and ancient 
roots back to the days of Australopithecus and continues through to this day.

Infant Mortality

“No parent should have to bury a child” (Guirgis, 2006, p. 9) is a common refrain of 
lament and agony upon the loss of a child. Regrettably, the history of infancy is, in 
fact, a history of parents having to do just this, with alarming frequency (Volk, 
2011). Roughly one-quarter of infants born in evolutionary and historical contexts 
failed to survive their first year of life (Volk & Atkinson, 2013). This staggering 
reality was a persistent economic and emotional burden to parents (Hanawalt, 
1995). Far from being a mundane event, this loss had a tremendous impact on par-
ents, and one can find many examples of the “searing grief” that parents experi-
enced (Heywood, 2018, p.  70). Upon losing his 8-month-old daughter, Martin 
Luther wrote, “I so lamented her death that I was exquisitely sick, my heart rendered 
soft and weak; never had I thought that a father’s heart could be so broken for their 
children’s sake.” (Heywood, 2018, p. 70). Infant mortality was, therefore, a sadly 
regular event that left an important impact on parents throughout human history.
It also resulted in significant evolutionary pressures on humans, influencing 
shifts in parenting, pair-bonding, maturation, and intelligence whose impact rival 
any other evolutionary pressures such as mating or violence (Volk & Atkinson, 
2008). The tremendous impact of infant mortality can also be seen in a range of 
modern responses ranging from mental health to demographic fertility changes 
(Alburez-Gutierrez et al., 2019). Our chapter aims to review the evidence regarding 
infant mortality from an evolutionary perspective before turning to modern infant 
mortality. In both cases, we will discuss the causes and consequences of infant mor-
tality as we review what might well be the most important achievement in our spe-
cies history: a massive, 50- to 100-fold decrease in the mortality rate of many 
modern infants.

5.1  Evolutionary and Historical Mortality Rates
5.1.1  Defining and Measuring Infant Mortality
To begin with, it is important to define infant mortality. While infancy is often 
extended to refer to development up to the second year of life, infant mortality sta-
tistics generally focus on mortality up to the end of the first year of life (Mathews 
et al., 2015). The infant mortality rate (IMR) is the probability of an infant dying 
before it is 366 days old. This 365-day period represents the riskiest period of mor-
tality in early life (Lawn et al., 2014). It includes neonatal mortality but excludes 
prenatal mortality.
Infant and child mortality would be best examined using direct paleodemo-
graphic archaeological data (Konigsberg & Frankenberg, 1994; Lewis, 2018; Milner 
et al., 2000; DeSilva, Chap. 4, this volume). Such data would allow researchers to 
make definitive claims regarding the intricate patterns of infant and child mortality 
rates of our Paleolithic hunter-gatherer ancestors. However, unfortunately, there are 
not enough data in these areas to make such definitive claims, in part, because such 
archaeological data are generally rare (Milner et al., 2000). More specifically, how-
ever, infant archaeological remains are particularly rare due to their fragility and, 
thus, lack of preservation (Lewis, 2018).
Therefore, in order to discuss and research infant and child mortality rates, we 
draw upon four separate proxies: twentieth-century hunter-gatherer IMR, historical 
records of IMR, agriculturalist IMR, and primate IMR. Some concerns exist with 
each of these populations. However, a general concern is that, as compared to adult 
deaths, infant deaths tend to attract less general attention and leave less tangible 
remains or records. Our data are thus, if anything, likely to be skewed toward dem-
onstrating lower mortality rates than existed in the past. With that important caveat 
in mind, we turn to the study of hunter-gatherer IMR.
5.1.2  Hunter-Gatherer IMR
Striking similarities between hunter-gatherer populations have been highlighted, 
specifically in population demographics (Blurton-Jones et al., 2002; Foley, 1995; 
Konner, 1977; Marlowe, 2010). Therefore, data presented will be a combination of 
modern hunter-gatherer populations and the limited existing Paleolithic data (e.g., 
Snow, 1948). Estimates of ancestral infant and child mortality rates in hunter-­
gatherer cultures will be provided through such combination. It should be noted that 
the modern hunter-gatherer societies from where the data are drawn are highly mar-
ginalized, leading the data to represent only one potential environment that was 
present in the EEA (Lee & Daly, 1999). It is reasonable to have some concern that 
such marginalization could contribute to increased reports of IMR. Taking such 
concerns into account, we have applied two solutions: first, our data have been

pulled from diverse environments, and second, a hunter-gatherer population that 
lived in a resource-rich environment has served as a checkpoint (Indian Knoll; 
Johnston & Snow, 2005).
The average IMR (see Table 5.1) was typically distributed around a mean of 
26.8% (SD = 6.9%; min = 14%, max = 40.5%; Volk & Atkinson, 2013). These 
results indicate that levels of infant mortality were consistently high among modern 
hunter-gatherer populations. This sample most strikingly demonstrates that among 
modern hunter-gatherers, the average infant had a greater than one in four chance of 
dying before their first birthday. Surprisingly, these rates hold even for the hunter-­
gatherer population that lived in an environment rich in resources (Indian Knoll, 
30%; Johnston & Snow, 2005, as cited in Volk & Atkinson, 2013). Thus, there is a 
significant degree of agreement in infant mortality rates in modern hunter-gather 
populations. But what about in actual historic populations?
5.1.3  Historic IMR
While hunter-gatherer populations are likely to be the best approximations of how 
humans lived for most of our species’ history, it is also worth noting that human 
evolution did not stop 10,000  years ago. There is some evidence that new

adaptations may have arisen during this time period, such as adults’ ability to digest 
lactose (Cochran & Harpending, 2009; Irons, 1998). Thus, rather than serving sim-
ply as proxies for previous populations, relatively recent historical data offer us 
actual data from the human EEA. As with paleoarchaeological data, death records 
and written life histories are relatively scant in comparison to their adult counter-
parts (Konigsberg & Frankenberg, 1994; Rawson, 2003; Walker et al. 1988). This is 
due to the more rapid decay of children’s smaller physical remains and the lower 
frequency of elaborate infant burials, death records, and written life histories (Lewis, 
2007). Therefore, the historical infant and child mortality rates we present should be 
viewed as conservative estimates that generally err toward underestimating actual 
historical rates.
The average historical IMR (see Table 5.2) from over 43 historical cultures was 
normally distributed around a M = 26.9% (SD = 4.8%; min = 17%, max = 40%; 
Volk & Atkinson, 2013). This is a remarkably convergent average, not only with 
respect to the previously discussed hunter-gatherer average IMR (see Table 5.1), but 
also across the vast swath of historical time periods, cultures, and geographical 
locations that the historical data represent. From the pre-Columbian Americas to 
Ancient Rome, to medieval Japan, to the European Renaissance, just over a quarter 
of infants died before their first birthdays.
It appears that regardless of whether we are using modern proxies (hunter-­
gatherers) or actual historical data, human infants faced daunting odds of dying in 
their first year. Obviously, if an individual died during their first year of life their 
evolutionary contributions would be zero. This makes infancy perhaps the most 
intensely selected year of human life (Williams, 1957; Jones, 2009). Quite simply, 
there is no other period in human life that matches the intensity of cost (i.e., life or 
death) at the same elevated level of ubiquity (25+%) – not adolescence, not mating, 
not childbirth, not warfare (Volk & Atkinson, 2008). For humans, the first year of 
life was perhaps the most critical period of life. How do these pressures compare 
with non-human primate IMR?
5.1.4  Non-human Primate IMR
The third set of data presented (Table 5.3) offers infant mortality rates among non-­
human primates. As with our modern hunter-gatherer data, it is important to note 
that the IMR of other primates can be seriously compromised by modern human 
influences (Köndgen et al., 2008). We therefore focus our primate data in general 
and for great apes in particular on stable populations that have not been seriously 
influenced by modern human activities such as poaching, zooanthropic disease 
transmission, and/or habitat loss.
Within the primate data, infant mortality rates were defined as the risk of mortal-
ity from birth to 1 year of age (Volk & Atkinson, 2013). Not surprisingly, there is 
some variation among different primate species IMR.  Neanderthals, who are 
humans’ closest extinct relatives (Green et  al., 2006), had a strikingly similar

average IMR of 28% (see Table 5.3; Volk & Atkinson, 2013) comparable to hunter-­
gatherer (Table 5.1) and historical (Table 5.2) averages. Chimpanzees, our closest 
living relatives (Britten, 2002), have a similar average IMR of 28.2% (see Table 5.3). 
This suggests that infant mortality has been a consistent pressure within the human 
family tree for several million years.
Intriguingly, gorilla IMR have a slightly lower average of 23.5%, while orang-
utan IMR is much lower at 11%. This suggests that not all great apes/hominids 
faced equal IMR pressures. In particular, orangutans have much lower levels of 
infant mortality, perhaps due to their solitary existence (i.e., fewer social stresses) 
and intensive maternal investment, as witnessed by relatively long interbirth

intervals of approximately 8 years (Wich et al., 2004). This is of great significance 
for evolutionary theorists, as it suggests that there are different adaptive responses 
to IMR among great apes. This in turn implies that there are adaptive reasons or 
trade-offs associated with the maintenance of chimpanzee, Neanderthal, and human 
IMR over the last few million years.
When we turn to look at more distantly related primates, we find much higher 
average IMR, ranging from 36% in large-bodied primates like baboons to 58% IMR 
in smaller primates (see Table 5.3). While these data are likely to be skewed at least 
in part by the shorter lifespans of non-ape primates, they are nevertheless instructive 
in illustrating that IMR appears to have a degree of phylogenetic stability and is 
thus, at least in part, a function of different evolutionary pressures. Why does this 
matter? It matters because it suggests that IMR is not a fixed or constrained feature 
of primate development, but rather primate IMR are a reflection of different 
responses to differing environmental pressures. Among humans, this is perhaps best 
illustrated by looking at agriculturalist IMR.
5.1.5  Agriculturalist IMR
Agriculturalists are indigenous cultures who get the majority of their calories from 
farming, even if they engage in some levels of hunting and gathering. Agriculturalists 
are different from hunter-gatherers not only in their diet, but also in their typically 
greater exposure to Western medicine, education, food, and laws. We know that 
exposure to these factors leads to a demographic transition that results in lower 
infant mortality (Coale & Watkins, 1986; Kramer & Greaves, 2007; Roth, 1981). 
We therefore caution the interpretation of these data as directly resembling even 
previous agriculturalist societies. That said, their inclusion can offer a perspective 
on how environmental factors can and do influence human IMR. The average agri-
culturalist IMR (see Table 5.4) was M = 20.6% (SD = 4.8%; min = 11%, max = 53%). 
While there is a variation among these groups’ IMR relative to their degree of 
Western contact, perhaps the more salient point is that IMR can be influenced by 
behavioral, cultural, and/or technological changes. To understand what these causes 
and changes are, it is instructive to first understand the causes of infant mortality in 
the EEA.
5.2  EEA Causes of Infant Mortality
There are a relatively diverse range of causes of mortality among hunter-gatherer 
infants. When considering a broad range of groups such as !Kung, settled Ache, for-
est Ache, Machi-guenga, Agta, !Kung, Tsimane, and Aborigines, Gurven and 
Kaplan (2007) found that 65% of total child mortality was due to disease, mainly 
gastrointestinal and respiratory, 9.5% due to congenital problems, 8% due to 
5  Infant Mortality

90
accidents, and 17% due to violence. The forest Ache and the Hiwi hunter-gatherer 
groups were the most aggressive groups of the sample, and if they were removed, 
child mortality due to violence fell to 5%. It is important to note that violent deaths 
were due to intraspecific violence rather than predation. The actual predation of 
hunter-gatherer children was virtually absent, although it is known to have occurred 
in the past (Wrangham et al. 2000). This contrasts with other primate populations 
that face significant, population-altering levels of mortality (Hart & Sussman, 2005; 
Hill & Dunbar, 1998). Predation rates are as high as 40% in baboons (Bulger & 
Hamilton 1987) and 65% in chimpanzees (Boesch & Boesch-Acherman, 2000). 
Thus, while disease, genetics, accidents, and intraspecific violence were important 
concerns for human children of all ages, predation was a weak threat compared to 
other primates.
With respect to disease, barring major mortality events such as the plague 
(McEvedy, 1988), pneumonia was the single biggest killer of infants in the EEA 
(Gurven & Kaplan, 2007). While EEA data are missing, in modern times, malnutri-
tion is the single greatest risk factor for pneumonia (Troeger et al., 2018). It may 
therefore be reasonable to presume that malnutrition played a similarly important 
role in leaving ancestral infants vulnerable to pneumonia. Given the relative fre-
quency of historical famines, as well as the slow population growth of

hunter-gatherers, it is reasonable to infer that malnutrition was relatively common 
in the EEA.  The risk of malnutrition on developing pneumonia is magnified if 
infants are not receiving adequate amounts of breastmilk (Lamberti et al., 2013), 
either due to a lack of maternal supply or reliance on other infant foods.
Exclusive breastfeeding also helps protect against the second primary patho-
genic killer – infant diarrhea (Lamberti et al., 2011). Diarrhea is associated with a 
lack of sanitation and/or clean drinking water (United Nations Children’s Fund, 
2010). There is some evidence that the risks of diarrhea are greater in the warmer 
summer months due to the proliferation of bacteria and other pathogens (Cheney, 
1984). In contrast, close proximity to others and the presence of fire smoke are 
found in colder months and both contribute to pneumonia (Dherani et al., 2008). 
Infants, therefore, faced a potentially year-round threat from pathogen-based 
mortality.
Among historical settings, disease (and to a much lower extent, accidents such as 
home fires) were the primary causes of infant mortality (Hanawalt, 1995). Further, 
in some historical settings, abandonment or infanticide were primary causes of 
infant and child mortality, with up to 50% of infants being abandoned in times of 
severe economic hardship (Budnik & Liczbińska, 2006; Cunningham, 2005; 
Rawson, 2003). In the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, European infants were 
placed in institutionalized or private care where mortality rates could exceed 90% 
(Cunningham, 2005). That this was a method of last resort can be witnessed by 
parents’ attempts to pay for the return of their infants should they regain their eco-
nomic standing (Cunningham, 2005). Infants thus faced a broad area of both recur-
ring and novel causes of mortality. An interesting question then arises: did these 
mortality risks lead to any adaptive changes in human behavior and diminish these 
levels of IMR?
5.3  Evolutionary Consequences of EEA Infant Mortality
As noted above, infant mortality is not a biologically fixed outcome. A number of 
factors can increase or decrease the rate of infant mortality. Not surprisingly, paren-
tal care is perhaps the most important factor in ancestral environments. Absence of 
parental care (especially maternal care) can lead to near-certain infant mortality in 
both historical (Cunningham, 2005) and hunter-gatherer (Hrdy, 1999; Sear & Mace, 
2008) populations. The general availability of parental resources is a good predictor 
of infant mortality both between (Preston & van de Walle, 1978) and within popula-
tions (Houweling & Kunst, 2010). More specifically, an increase in food quality and 
quantity decreases mortality (Gage, 1994; Houweling & Kunst, 2010). An increase 
in alloparental support can also decrease mortality levels (Hawkes et al., 1989; Sear 
& Mace, 2008; Sear et al., 2002), with some researchers suggesting that the impor-
tance of alloparental and paternal care can be seen in the evolution of human social 
structures (Chapais, 2009; Hrdy, 2009; Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6; Hrdy & Burkart, 
Chap. 8, this volume). Parenting does seem to be a learned skill, with first-borns 
5  Infant Mortality

suffering from higher infant mortality rates (Cohen, 1975), perhaps due to the inex-
perience of their parents (Smith, 2005). Interestingly, being a first-time mother does 
not appear to affect child mortality rates (Cohen, 1975), perhaps because older chil-
dren are less susceptible to first-time parents’ mistakes. In a related fashion, in 
stressed populations, mothers with higher IQs may have higher child survival rates 
(Čvorović et al., 2008).
Family size is also positively related to mortality rates, presumably because (all 
else being equal) in larger families, each child has access to fewer resources (Cohen, 
1975). Hygienic practices surrounding newborns can also profoundly impact mor-
tality rates by regulating the amount and type of pathogens that infants are exposed 
to (Wood, 1983). Other behavioral factors that affect IMR include breastfeeding 
(e.g., Golding et al., 1997; Volk, 2009), reduced inter-birth-intervals (Alam, 1995, 
Bøhler, & Bergström, 1995; Hobcraft et al., 1983, Palloni & Millman, 1986), and 
polygyny (e.g., Omariba & Boyle 2007). Mothers in polygynous families may com-
pete with each other over the capacity to provide for their infants as a means of 
intrasexual competition (Hrdy, 1999, Volk & Franklin, 2020). There are almost cer-
tainly other factors that relate to infant mortality rates, leaving plenty of room for 
the evolutionary pressures of infant mortality to influence the development of 
human behavior and infant development.
This volume is replete with examples of how infants are designed to not only 
learn about their environment but to survive them. At the most basic level, one of the 
oldest evolutionary theories on behavior is that infants form attachment bonds with 
caregivers that promote their survival (Bowlby, 2008). Hart (Chap. 7, this volume) 
discusses how critical this was with regard to breastfeeding. As noted in this chap-
ter, breastfeeding is an important element of infant survival. But mothers are not the 
only adults who provide care to infants. Infants have evolved neotenous cues that 
evoke feelings of parental care from adults in general (Bjorklund, Chap. 2, this vol-
ume). Intriguingly, there is some evidence that these cues are weaker at birth than 
they are later in life, suggesting that it may be parents who evolved to prefer “safer” 
neotenous cues (Franklin et al., 2018). This could be an example of mother-infant 
conflict (Salmon & Jaeger, Chap. 11, this volume), where the needs of an individual 
infant are weighed against a mother’s commitment to providing for her entire fam-
ily. The fact that these two energy expenditures do not always align highlights how 
important infant mortality was as a selective evolutionary pressure for both infants 
and mothers.
That said, it is clear that adults beyond the mother (and often father) are impor-
tant for infants’ wellbeing and development (Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6; Hrdy & 
Burkart; Chap. 8; Henry & Morelli, Chap. 10, this volume). Infants appear to be 
adapted to understanding and interacting with other minds in their environment, 
perhaps as a way of deepening bonds and soliciting care while they simultaneously 
use those external minds to learn about their environment (Buttelmann, Chap. 13, 
this volume). At the same time as they are learning from others, infants also possess 
predispositions that help them safely navigate their physical environment, such as 
the development of appropriate fears to manage risks (Rakison, Chap. 14, this vol-
ume). These examples are but a small sample of the wide range of infant and adult

adaptations that appear to have evolved, at least in part, to offset the risks of infant 
mortality. There are likely many more that remain to be discovered as elevated IMR 
of 26%+ were truly a significant evolutionary selection pressure that humans, and 
their close relatives, had to deal with. With that said, we now turn to an examination 
of modern IMR and what they tell us about both successes and remaining chal-
lenges for infants.
5.4  Modern Changes to IMR
Modernity has clearly reinforced the idea that IMR is influenced by external factors. 
In what is perhaps the most significant event in human history, infant mortality 
decreased significantly between prehistoric times and the twenty-first century 
(Stearns, 2006), with modern infant mortality rates falling to lows below 0.28% in 
some developed countries (United Nations, 2019). This represents a shocking 100-­
fold increase in the survival of infants as compared to infants in hunter-gatherer or 
historical times! As impressive as this achievement is, IMR today continues to fall. 
Between 1990 and 2017, the global annual infant mortality rates decreased by 51% 
(Hug et al., 2019). Reductions in rates of infant and child mortality can be attributed 
to a variety of global trends.
The demographic transition theory discusses how infant birth and death rates 
change as a result of economic development, with high birth rates and high infant 
death rates being present in societies with little to no technology, education, or 
industrial development, and low birth rates and low death rates being found in 
nations with more advanced technology, higher levels of education, and signifi-
cantly better economic development (Thompson, 1929). This pattern follows two 
general trends: (1) a drastic population increase due to decreases in death rates 
(specifically in infants and children) is brought on by industrialization, followed by 
(2) a decline in population growth due to decreased fertility levels (Herzer et al. 
2012; United Nations, 2019). Over the past several decades, a decline in fertility and 
infant mortality has been seen in nearly all countries (United Nations, 2019). As 
IMR fall, parents tend to implement fertility control as the infants they have are 
expected to survive and they can, therefore, risk having fewer offspring (Amin & 
Basu, 2004).
Increased infant and child survival can also be attributed to medical research and 
advancements. Today, when infants are born premature, or when children become 
ill, there are resources and protocols to save them. In the last two decades, leaps and 
bounds have been made in the medical field to preserve infants’ lives (Stoll et al., 
2015). Ironically, the improved ability to successfully cope with earlier preterm 
infants has led to a somewhat artificial stagnation of infant mortality rates in devel-
oped countries (Tomashek et al., 2007). This is a result of infants being born at 
preterm ages that would not have been viable in the past (Larroque et al., 2004; 
Malloy, 2015). The fact that these infants are viable today is unequivocally a contin-
ued improvement worth celebrating, even if they depress the average IMR, as these 
5  Infant Mortality

preterm infants represent a previously impossible expansion of infancy. That caveat 
aside, there are a number of factors that account for the drop in modern IMR.
Vaccines are one of the more visible means of reducing infant mortality 
(McGovern & Canning, 2015). For example, in rural Bangladesh, the measles vac-
cine was administered to infants and children between the ages of 9 and 60 months 
(Koenig et al., 1990). Mortality rates among vaccinated infants and children were as 
much as 46% less than those for nonvaccinated children. Evidence like this is a 
strong testimony to the need to counteract conspiracy-based antivaccination theo-
ries that have the potential to imperil the lives of infants (Kata, 2012), either directly 
or indirectly, through the loss of herd immunity (May & Silverman, 2003).
In order for infants and children to reap the benefits of such resources as vac-
cines, they must have access to them. This first required the development of a scien-
tific approach to medicine that allowed for unprecedented progress in both 
knowledge and practice (Porter, 1999). The incorporation of science-based health 
care allows access to medical resources without financial strain, leading people to 
decrease delays in seeking treatment (Dykes, 1950). This is exemplified in Luhrmann 
and Wilson’s (2018) finding that within one year of the introduction of universal 
health care in the UK, there was a 17% reduction in infant mortality due to more 
timely access to treatment. Another government-sponsored initiative that benefitted 
children was the development of formalized sanitation systems. The significance of 
sanitation in decreasing rates of infants’ and children’s mortality cannot be ignored 
and is exemplified in numerous studies (e.g., Mara et al. 2010; Satterthwaite et al. 
1996). In 2010, UNICEF highlighted that sanitation interventions were the most 
cost-effective intervention for decreasing infant and child mortality (UNICEF, 
2010). Such implementations are standard due to the fact that diarrhea and parasite 
infections are the most common causes of death in many developing countries (e.g., 
Black et al., 2010). But not all interventions require government or medical-based 
systems. Investing in individuals can also yield significant results for IMR, espe-
cially if those individuals are mothers.
In every culture that has ever existed, mothers are, on average, the primary care-
givers of infants (Hrdy, 1999). It is therefore not surprising that by giving mothers 
the tools and power that education affords results in significant benefits to their 
infants’ survival. The strong negative association between maternal education and 
infant and child mortality has been well documented (e.g., Bicego & Boerma 1990; 
Cleland et al. 1992; Nakamura et al., 2011) and is considered to be a critical factor 
in reducing rates of mortality (Andriano & Monden, 2019). The negative associa-
tion between women’s empowerment and infant mortality has been studied exten-
sively (e.g., Boehmer & Williamson 1996; Smith et  al. 2003; Scanlan 2010). 
Women’s empowerment can create such extensive and positive changes in chil-
dren’s lives, in that women are much most likely to use the resources available to 
them to help their children and ensure the family needs have been satisfied 
(Hoddinott & Haddad, 1995) and tend to favor spending resources on things that aid 
in infant and child survival, such as vaccinations, education, and nutrition 
(Quisumbing, 2003).

5.5  Future Directions
It is appropriate to end a discussion of infant mortality rates following a discussion 
of empowering women, who have been and remain today, the primary caregivers of 
children (Hrdy, 1999). Given infants’ obvious inability to lobby for systemic 
changes and improvements to IMR, it rests on the shoulders of motivated adults to 
do so for them. Ironically though, the near-total success of this endeavor has hidden 
the horrifying history of infant mortality from many scholars. It is our hope that the 
true significance of this human achievement (i.e., lowering IMR) does not come at 
the price of ignorance of our past and the tremendous risks that infants faced in 
surviving their first year of life. This would be particularly ironic given the potential 
role that infant and child death played in Darwin’s decision to write and publish The 
Origin of Species (Keynes, 2002). We would thus like to end our chapter by calling 
for continued research into the evolution of infancy, infant caregiving, and the role 
of IMR in shaping human evolution.

An Unusually Human Time: Effects 
of the Most Social Stage on the Most Social 
Species
John L. Locke and Barry Bogin
More than a century ago, the US Supreme Court issued a ruling that speaks to a 
basic feature of human nature and, indirectly, the role of infancy in human develop-
ment. The decision referred to some horrific events that had taken place in peniten-
tiaries. “A considerable number of prisoners fell … into a semi-fatuous condition, 
from which it was next to impossible to arouse them,” Court records indicate, “and 
others … became violently insane; others still, committed suicide.” Most of the 
survivors failed to “recover sufficient mental activity to be of any subsequent ser-
vice to the community” (Haney & Lynch, 1997, p. 484).
What was done to the prisoners? We might guess that they were fed rancid food 
or physically tortured, or perhaps used as guinea pigs in a medical experiment. But 
the cause of the prisoners’ condition was neither physically cruel nor invasive. They 
were simply left alone – literally alone – denied the opportunity to see and interact 
with other prisoners.
This material was included in the Court’s ruling because concerns were growing 
over the use of solitary confinement. When they prepared a rough summary of 
America’s experience with this punishment, it was to rule on a case involving a man 
who had been found guilty of murder and was being held in isolation while waiting 
to be hanged. The Court concluded that solitude was worse than hanging, based on 
the experiences recounted above, and ordered the prisoner’s immediate release.

What this suggests, of course, is that humans need to be around others. If we go 
too long without relating, many of us will become lonely or depressed, and if we 
have too few friends, we may become physically ill or even die (Caccioppo & 
Patrick, 2008; Hawkley & Cacioppo, 2010).
We even need images of people. One indication is anthropomorphism, a “man-­
in-­the-moon” sort of phenomenon in which normally adjusted people naturally 
imbue nonhuman entities with human qualities (Eddy et al., 1993; Heider & Simmel, 
1944), or infer their characteristics from human artifacts, including art, literature, 
and tools (Donoghue, 1983; Stephen, 1874, p. 252; Tylor, 1974).
More directly relevant to claims we will make here are findings on institutional-
ized infants who are given basic care but denied normal levels of social contact. 
Even with food and opportunities to exercise, many of these neglected infants fail to 
develop physically and mentally, and some die (Spitz, 1945; Sonuga-Barke et al., 
2017). Significantly, as we will see later, there is also a specific relationship between 
social deprivation in infancy and brain volume in adulthood (Mackes et al., 2020).
6.1  How Did We Get to Be So Social?
The other primates are extremely social (Humphrey, 1976; Jolly, 1966), more gre-
garious than most other animal species (Bogin et al., 2014; Boyd & Richerson, 
2009; Burkart et al., 2014; Hrdy, 2016), and ours is undoubtedly the most social 
species of all. This raises questions as to what events made us humans so gregarious. 
When, in evolution, did our need for social stimulation and interaction become so 
intense?
For some theorists, an early beginning point was the out-migration from Africa 
more than 100,000 years ago, which may have reduced the morbid effects of certain 
parasites and diseases (McNeill, 1976), increasing the number of humans on earth. 
Others point to reductions in megafauna and the onset of agriculture within the past 
15–20,000  years, which increased the size of residential groups (van der Kaars 
et al., 2017). But it has been claimed that even before then, group living decreased 
the threat of predation (Port et al., 2020). When it did so, residential groups increased 
competition for needed resources, shifting vigilance from group-external events to 
the behavior of group members (Locke, 2008). If groups were to be kept together, 
their members would have to become socially tolerant, restrained, and, if they were 
to maximize their productivity, cooperative (Hare et al., 2007). Cooperation would 
have enabled many things, including “social capital,” the exchange of assistance, 
knowledge, tools, and other resources that presuppose the existence of relationships 
based on trust (Coleman, 1988). Since exchanges are based on assumptions regard-
ing repayment, social capital required that individuals keep track of who was owed 
and who was owing.
It is also assumed that living in close proximity to individuals who were capable 
of competition and cooperation, and at any given time might be intending either, 
required the ability to “read” people, that is, to evaluate their personal qualities and 
anticipate their actions; to know when people were attempting to mislead; to infer

what people were planning, given what they were likely to know; and to remember 
which information had been shared with which others or had been withheld.
At some time in human evolution, “mental ledgers” of things to be shared or 
withheld, and people with whom to cooperate or compete, were formalized into 
social kinship systems that define obligations and expectations between the mem-
bers of a social group (Mauss, 1925/2002). In traditional societies, which include 
foraging groups (hunter-gatherers), pastoralists, and horticulturalists, the central 
organizing principle for determining obligations is kinship, the “glue” that binds 
human societies together. Kinship applies most strongly in traditional preindustrial 
societies, but includes modern nation-states with economies based on intensive 
agricultural or industry, as well as contemporary postindustrial states (Carsten, 
2000; Höllinger & Haller, 1990; Schneider, 1984). As we discuss in the following 
section, human kinship plays a significant role in the care of pregnant women and 
their infants and is learned by infants from birth.
For many theorists, the most significant evolution in the area of social cognition 
was theory of mind, that is, the awareness that others know things that one might 
not, and the ability to infer the nature of that knowledge; and intentionality, that is, 
the ability to anticipate what one or more other people know, or are thinking, that 
others know or are thinking (Cole, 2014; Lewis et al., 2017; Povinelli & Preuss, 
1995; Povinelli & Vonk, 2003).
Where nonhuman primates are said to have “Napoleonic” brains that evolved the 
potential for complex cognitive processes in response to behavior pressures exerted 
by heterospecific animals (Ashton et al., 2020), we humans are said to have brains 
that are “Machiavellian,” after the sixteenth-century Italian diplomat who advised 
young politicians on ways to use deception to negotiate their way through complex 
social situations (Byrne & Whiten, 1988). Five centuries later, it is clear that even if 
we choose to follow a straight and narrow path in our own lives, we are still 
Machiavellian in our capacity to deal with various kinds of human entanglements, 
even if doing so requires that we be able to implement or detect various acts of 
deception (Locke, 2008). That’s why we are said to have Machiavellian brains, ones 
that enable us to prosper in complex social situations.
Of particular importance here is the Social Brain Hypothesis, the claim, associ-
ated primarily with anthropologist Robin Dunbar, which holds that increases in the 
size of hominin groups added to the complexity of social relations, ultimately 
enhancing the size of the brain, especially the neocortex (Dunbar, 1992, 1998, 2003, 
2009). It is assumed that the enlargement of groups increased the ability of homi-
nins to handle social complexity, enabling them to maintain the social cohesion 
required to keep groups together. With a brain equipped for so many different social 
operations, it is safe to assume that our ancestors found new ways to relate to, con-
nect with, and interpret the behavior of others (Burkart et al., 2009, 2014), imbuing 
us – their descendants – with cognitive resources and strategies that facilitate social-
ization and cooperation.
While accepting the need for an hypothesis such as Dunbar’s, we will offer a 
complementary hypothesis of our own, one that altered important properties of 
infancy, extending and intensifying socially formative experiences associated 
with care.

6.2  The Evolution of Development
No account of human evolution can be complete, wrote zoologist Walter Garstang a 
century ago, if it fails to identify the environmental changes that produced relevant 
traits in development, and the reasons why the new traits would have conferred con-
temporaneous reproductive advantages (Garstang, 1922). He said it was absurd to 
suppose that a new trait could evolve in mature members of a species, a judgment 
that has been repeatedly confirmed in recent years (Gould, 1977; Hall, 2002; 
Northcutt, 1990; West-Eberhard, 2003). This is why, if our questions relate to the 
evolution of behavior, we must consider any role that may have been played by 
evolutionary changes in infancy (see Bjorklund, Chap. 2, this volume).
Although a great deal of evolutionary thinking is associated with behavioral 
traits that develop, we will, in the spirit of Garstang, focus on the evolution of devel-
opment itself, with particular attention to infancy. If this stage was transformed by 
the advent of new social practices or pressures, infancy itself may have become a 
variable in the evolution of human sociality. Taking the infancy of other primates as 
a starting point, we will ask how our own infancy evolved, then offer an Infant Care 
Hypothesis which holds that this stage in life history contributed to the evolution of 
sociality in our species, perhaps in tandem with operations identified under the 
Social Brain Hypothesis.
6.2.1  A Brief Note on Primate Infancies
Nonhuman primates provide a clear starting point in that they have an infancy with 
different properties than ours. This enables us to ask what changed the ancestral 
infancy to the modern one, and what the modern infancy, as changed, may have 
contributed to our species that the ancestral one could not.
A primate infant, whether it is human or nonhuman, is usually in intimate contact 
with its mother, or in a few species, the father or an individual that is genetically 
related to the mother. The infant cannot survive without near-constant care and pro-
tection, usually from its mother, who provides some or all of its nourishment by way 
of lactation. Depending on the primate species, lactation lasts from months to years. 
One reason is biological: infants lack teeth and jaw strength to process the adult 
diet. Another reason is emotional: the physical bond with the mother provides the 
physical touch, social support, and cognitive stimulation that all primate infants 
require to survive and grow into healthy adults.
Here, we provide a brief overview of infancy, followed, in a later section, by a 
more detailed look into the several phases and intervals within a human infancy in 
which specific developmental operations occur.

6.2.2  An Overview of Human Life History
Before proceeding further, let’s take a brief glance at the stages of human postnatal 
development in relation to physical growth in length or height. Note, in Fig. 6.1, that 
it is the velocity curve that best pinpoints the transition between stages.
Among the changes in life history that we discuss here are ones that left the 
human infant unusually helpless – unable to survive without an intensification and 
extension of care (Bogin, 1997, 2021; Hrdy, 2009, 2016; Locke & Bogin, 2006a; 
see Hrdy & Burkart, Chap. 8, this volume). An important change occurred when

lines) and boys (solid lines). Distance is the amount of height achieved at a given age. In part A, 
the image shows a child’s height being measured. Velocity is the rate of growth at a given time, in 
this case shown as centimeters per year. In part B, the running figure represents “velocity.” The 
velocity curves show the postnatal stages of the pattern of human growth. Note the spurts in growth 
rate at mid-childhood and adolescence for both girls and boys. The postnatal stages: I infancy, C

weaning, which marks the end of infancy, was reduced from five years – the age of 
chimpanzee weaning – to three. This truncated the period of maternal lactation, 
allowing the mother to invest energy and other resources into a new pregnancy. We 
assume that reduction of the interbirth interval was selected, as it would have 
increased the reproductive success of our premodern ancestors, at least if previous 
infants were kept alive.
6.2.2.1  Caring for Many Infants
Human ancestors solved the problem of postweaning care by enlisting the assis-
tance of other people in their social group. None of the nonhuman apes practices 
this kind of cooperative breeding (some South American monkeys and nonprimate 
mammals do) (see Hrdy & Burkart, Chap. 8, this volume). We discuss the human 
type of cooperative breeding later in this chapter. Our point here is that the resulting 
increase in other dependent siblings would have stiffened competition for care, 
pressuring infants to find new ways to attract attention and assistance.
Feeding by lactation defines the infancy of humans and all other mammalian spe-
cies (see Hart, Chap. 7, this volume). The evolution of lactation required behavioral 
changes in mothers and their offspring. One change, as we will discuss, is bonding, 
which maintains the infant in contact and communication with the mother so that it 
can be suckled when hungry. The mother-offspring contact ensuing from this feed-
ing method establishes a period of dependency in the young and a reciprocal period 
of investment by the mother.
6.2.2.2  The Neonatal Stage
Birth involves a critical and stressful transition from intra- to extra-uterine environ-
ments. Neonates must quickly adjust their own metabolism to the extra-uterine 
environment, and this involves temperature regulation, breathing, sleeping, eating, 
digestion, elimination, and other autoregulatory processes (Ward Platt & Deshpande, 
2005). The neonate, of course, cannot do all of these on its own and receives much 
care, especially for feeding, and we focus here on a few important aspects of human 
lactation. In the following discussion, we consider only full-term (37–42 weeks’ 
gestation) human neonates of normal birth weight (2.5–4.3 kg) because preterm, 
low-birth-weight, or high-birth-weight neonates are at elevated risk of mortality. 
(The medical technology needed to sustain such neonates has been available for 
only 50 years or less.) Thus, during all but a sliver of evolutionary history, there was 
strong selection against neonates born outside the range of full-term and normal 
birth weight.
The human neonate is born with a large body mass relative to other apes. This is 
due, in part, to the fact that human infants are born with a greater reserve of fat than 
any other mammal (Kuzawa, 1998). This reserve not only allows for survival during 
the first few days after birth but also fuels the rapid brain growth shown in Fig. 6.2. 
J. L. Locke and B. Bogin

113
By the fifth postnatal day, human milk composition begins to mature in terms of 
energy and other nutrient content and is fully mature by 4–6 weeks postpartum 
(Ballard & Morrow, 2013). That it matures no sooner than 28 days after birth is, in 
our view, the single most compelling reason to consider that duration as the neonatal 
period. Biologically, this duration also makes sense in that both the neonate and the 
mother make physiological adjustments during this time from pregnancy to extra-
uterine life. Even with these adjustments in place at the transition from neonate to 
one-month-old infant, that infant remains motorically altricial and depends on its 
mother and others for care and feeding.
Lactation and infancy prolong this period of dependency but allow for rapid and 
high-quality growth and greater physical and behavioral adaptability (Pond, 1977). 
Infancy may also increase the latter by giving young mammals the time required to 
practice and improve innate behaviors, such as the stalking of prey in carnivores. 
Bonds between mothers and infants also increase opportunities for young mammals 
to acquire learned behaviors by observing and imitating their mother or other adult 
animals with whom she interacts.
In neurologically more advanced mammals, especially the primates generally, 
mothers and infants remain in virtually constant contact for several weeks or months 
after birth, but most primate females give birth to one infant per pregnancy. (Rare 
exceptions include South American marmosets and tamarins that regularly give 
birth to twins and, not coincidentally, practice cooperative breeding.) These single-
ton births facilitate intimate physical contact in that there is no competition between 
siblings for the mother. Suckling is done “on demand,” 24 hours per day. Primates 
grow slowly relative to most other mammals, and the concentration of energy in the 
milk of primates is lower than that of the faster-growing “primitive” mammals. But 
the efficiency, constancy, and quality of physical contact and nutrient supply in the 
primates are superior (Widdowson, 1976).

ductive organs. (From Bogin (2021) which provides citations to the data sources)

Newborn primates are highly active, traveling with the mother, clinging to her 
body, and experiencing many of the same things that she experiences while develop-
ing their own motor and sensory skills. The relatively slow growth rate of primate 
infants intensifies their dependency on and intimacy with the mother. Infant depen-
dency extends the period of growth, development, protection, and opportunity for 
infants to learn survival skills by observing successful maternal behaviors (Jolly, 
1985). These benefits of infant dependency increase the probability that the new-
born will reach reproductive age, increasing their own and their mother’s fitness.
In some ways, dependency seems disadvantageous to the primate mother. 
Competition for nesting space and breeding territories, aggressive encounters with 
conspecifics for mates, and mating itself are often impossible for mothers with 
dependent young. Infant dependency is also incompatible with some features of 
adult behavior, particularly further reproduction. The reason is that the energy 
demands of lactation, along with the care and carrying of the infant, suppress fecun-
dity. Even if the mother could conceive while caring for her current infant, her deli-
cate energy balance and the total physical stress of pregnancy and infant care would 
increase the risk of mortality to the mother, her infant, and her fetus.
6.3  Infancy from a Physical Perspective
We begin by discussing physical features of infancy, then ask how these and other 
features evolved. In doing so, we will review some changes that occur in develop-
ment, for example, in teeth and bones. At first glance, these measures may seem 
trivial – we might wonder what they could possibly say about our highly social and 
intelligent species – but they may have contributed to much larger changes in our 
nature. The analogy in archaeology might be a partial footprint or fragment of bone 
that means nothing by itself but, when dated, suggests when human-like bipedalism 
evolved or migration to a new land took place in prehistory.1
By the start of the second trimester of human pregnancy, the differentiation of 
cells into tissues and organs is complete and the embryo is now a fetus. Physical 
growth is extraordinarily rapid. The fertilized egg cell, which is no larger than the 
period at the end of this sentence, divides and its daughter cells enlarge so that by 
the sixth month the fetus is recognizably human and between 36 and 38 cm long 
(14–15 inches), which is about 74% of average birth length of 50 cm. Increases in 
weight during this same period are also rapid, with the greatest gains during the 
third trimester of pregnancy. During this last trimester, the development and matura-
tion of several physiological systems, such as the circulatory, respiratory, and 
digestive systems, also occur, preparing the fetus for the transition to extra-uterine 
life following birth.

scope of this chapter but are available online and in print (see review in Bogin, 2021).

Infancy, including the neonatal first month after birth, spans the first three years 
of postnatal life. It is characterized by the most rapid growth velocity of any stage 
in the life history of our species. During the first year, infants grow an average of 
about 28 centimeters in length, an increase of more than 50% of birth length (about 
50  cm), and seven kilograms in weight, which more than doubles birth weight 
(about 3.4 kg).
The rate of decrease in velocity is also very steep, which makes infancy the life 
stage with the most rapidly changing rate of growth. The infant’s curve of growth, 
with rapid and decelerating velocity, is a continuation of the fetal pattern, in which 
the rate of growth in length reaches its peak in the second trimester and then begins 
a deceleration that lasts until childhood (Fig. 6.1).
One surprising feature of human growth during infancy is the similarity that most 
infants show both in the amount and rate of growth during the first six months of 
life. One might expect that variation in hereditary and environmental factors 
between individual infants and populations leads to marked differences in amounts 
and rates of growth. But several investigative teams (Habicht et al., 1974; Van Loon 
et al., 1986) have shown that in the first six months of life, the growth of healthy 
infants of normal birth weight is remarkably similar across a wide variety of ethnic 
and socioeconomic classes in developed and developing nations. This is one of the 
shared characteristics that makes human infancy a species-specific period of growth 
and development.
As indicated, the other primates are considered less social than humans, which 
may be related, indirectly, to the fact that their brains develop relatively sooner than 
ours. By birth, the rhesus monkey has already achieved 68% of its ultimate brain 
weight, whereas the human newborn’s brain is only about 26% of what it will weigh 
in maturity (Harvey & Clutton-Brock, 1985; Lindburg, 1982; see Bjorklund, Chap. 
2; DeSilva, Chap. 3, this volume). Growth curves of the body tissues shown in 
Fig. 6.2 place the priority of human postnatal brain growth in context.
The brain of a human newborn is about 341 cm3 in volume, more than double the 
size of a chimpanzee brain at birth (c. 155 cm3; Holland et al., 2014). By the age of 
seven years, the chimp brain has grown to about 350 cm3, but the human brain sur-
passes a median size of 1300 cm3, meaning that the chimpanzee brain has expanded 
by 2.3 times and the human brain by 3.8 times (Fig. 6.3).
Although the motor skills of human infants are relatively delayed, as we will 
discuss, they develop rapidly as infancy progresses. At birth, states of wakefulness 
and sleep are not sharply differentiated, and motor coordination is variable and tran-
sient, but a month later the typical infant can lift its chin when prone and by two 
months lift its chest by doing a “push-up.” By 4 months, infants can sit with support, 
and by 7 months, they can do so without it; by 8 months, they can crawl, and by 
10 months, infants can walk with support (Fig. 6.4).
Early infancy ends at about 12 months as the first unsupported bipedal steps are 
taken. With the transition to the middle-to-late infancy period, walking, running, 
object manipulation, and other motor skills continue to appear in a mostly gradual 
manner for many years. By two years, infants can walk without assistance and leaf 
through a book one page at a time. There is a similar gradual progression in problem

116
solving and general cognitive abilities of infants. In contrast, some specific motor-­
cognitive skills, especially spoken language, develop more rapidly. Typically, the 
rudiments of a linguistic system are operative by the end of infancy (Locke, 1997; 
Locke & Bogin, 2006a).
The development of the skeleton, musculature, and nervous system are respon-
sible for the infant’s motor and cognitive advancements. Especially important is the 
rapid growth of the brain, which grows more rapidly during infancy than almost any 
other tissue or organ of the body (Figs. 6.2 and 6.3; see Bjorklund, Chap. 2; DeSilva, 
Chap. 3, this volume). In general, the various regions of the brain develop quickly, 
whether they control physical growth and the reproductive system or behavioral and 
cognitive development, especially the latter.
From a physical perspective, the emergence of the last deciduous tooth is impor-
tant, for this is one of the events that signals the end of infancy in humans. Emergence

Brain mass increases during the postnatal period in both species. Lines represent best-fit Lowess 
regressions through the data points. “M,” males; “F,” females; “U,” sex unidentified (Vrba, 1998). 
The human regressions separate into male (upper) and female (lower) curves. The inset shows 
brain-mass growth for each species during the first postnatal year. Vrba proposed that the human 
difference in brain mass growth was due to hypermorphosis, that is, the heterochronic process of 
prolongation of the rapid fetal growth seen in the chimpanzee. Vrba described the chimpanzee pat-
tern as ancestral to the human pattern. Leigh (2004) re-analyzed the data with more appropriate 
mathematical and statistical models and found no evidence for prolongation or heterochrony. 
Rather, humans evolved new patterns of rapid growth before and after birth. See the text for more 
details. (Reproduced from Leigh, 2004, with kind permission of the author)

of all the deciduous teeth allows the infant to switch from dependence on breast-
feeding to eating appropriate weaning foods. In traditional hunter-gatherer, horti-
culture, pastoral, or agricultural societies, weaning occurs between 24 and 36 months 
of age. By this age, all the deciduous teeth have erupted, even for very late maturing 
infants. Thus, by 36 months of age, both biological developments (motor develop-
ment, tooth emergence) and behavioral changes in the mother-infant relationship 
(weaning) occur, as well as the cognitive and linguistic achievements mentioned 
above, signaling the end of infancy.
6.4  Infancy from a Behavioral Perspective
The human neonate has a large body relative to other apes, a small brain size relative 
to the human adult, and, as we will discuss, a prolonged period of extreme motor 
immaturity relative to other ape neonates (Trevathan & Rosenberg, 2016). These 
traits – an unusual combination for a primate newborn – make the human infant a 
costly creature to carry around, protect, and feed  – burdens usually falling on 
the mother.

Trevathan and Rosenberg emphasize that human altriciality – an underdeveloped 
and helpless state – requires maternal commitment to the neonate, which has impor-
tant behavioral implications for the social group. Humans have been called “super 
cooperators” in that they display cooperative assistance, support, and mutual aid in 
relation to reproduction, care of pregnant women, and the rearing of offspring 
(Nowak & Highfield, 2011; see Hary & Burhart, Chap. 8, this volume). But humans 
take super-cooperation much further than any other cooperatively breeding species, 
adding language, especially kinship names for carers with well-defined responsi-
bilities, and marriage, which unites groups of kinfolk and creates networks for the 
exchange of care of pregnant women, infants, and children.
The human pattern of reproduction results in decreased fertility (number of 
births), but this is offset by greater survival of offspring, and the net result is that 
human mothers can have more offspring in their reproductive lifetime than nonhu-
man primate mothers. More offspring, of course, means more intense social stimu-
lation and interaction, and the greater the advantage of infants with unusually 
well-developed brains and social skills.
The human style of super cooperation in offspring production and care is best 
conceptualized as biocultural reproduction (BCR), which includes the set of mar-
riage- and kinship-based rules for extra-maternal cooperation in the production, 
feeding, and care of offspring (Bogin et al., 2014; Bogin et al., 2018). With the 
assistance of other group members, women not only have more births than other 
apes but also keep alive more of their offspring until they reach adulthood.
BCR allows humans to create social networks to share the energy and labor costs 
for producing food, preparing meals, and feeding, caring for, and protecting off-
spring and their mothers. Reiches and colleagues conceptualized the human style of 
care and feeding for offspring and their mothers in the form of a “pooled energy 
budget,” which they defined as the combined energetic allocations of all members 
of a reproductive community that might result in direct or indirect reproductive 
effort (Reiches et al., 2009; Fig. 6.5). According to Reiches et al., the pooled energy 
budget allows women to sustain a higher fertility and greater offspring survival than 
would be possible for energetically isolated individuals. If so, the biobehavioral 
characteristics of human infancy, childhood, and BCR may have coevolved as 
derived characteristics of our species, for no living ape species practices these types 
of behaviors or has a childhood, the ensuing stage of human life history.
BCR is in sharp contrast to the cooperative breeding practiced by some nonhu-
man species, which is based primarily, if not entirely, on a strict biological kin selec-
tion, that is, the degree of genetic relatedness between mothers and their assistants 
(called alloparents; Lukas & Clutton-Brock, 2012; see Hrdy & Burkart, Chap. 8; 
Henry & Morelli, Chap. 10, this volume). Human BCR is maintained through 
socially defined kinship and friendship networks, which operate independently of 
the degree of genetic relationship (Bogin et al., 2014).
BCR and cooperative breeding have something in common: in both cases, infants 
receive care from a number of different individuals, which surely contributes to the 
sociality of that stage in life history. But we think that BCR may contribute some-
thing to the social nature of infancy that cooperative breeding does not, at least not 
J. L. Locke and B. Bogin

119
to the same degree; it’s the breadth and flexibility of social interaction, since in BCR 
there may be more variation in the carers themselves, including their motivation to 
participate.
Nearly 40 years ago, Robert Trivers (1974) pointed out that carers have compet-
ing responsibilities, including the management of other children, and thus look for 
opportunities to withdraw care, which infants attempt to forestall by mounting 
increasingly clever bids for attention, and by monitoring parental responses to these 
behaviors. When there is competition for care, infants are inclined to invent ways to 
attract it (Locke, 2006; see Hart, Chap. 15 this volume).
How and when in human evolution biocultural reproduction appeared is 
unknown, although there are several speculative hypotheses, including greater reli-
ance on stone tools, the use of fire and other extractive technologies (Wells & 
Fig. 6.5  Energy trade-offs in life history. For all animals, energy is extracted from food consumed, 
digested, absorbed, and metabolized. Otherwise, the energy is lost in waste (feces, metabolic heat 
loss, etc.). Available energy may be used to build biological reserves, which may be either used by 
the individual’s body for maintenance (including basal metabolic activity and immune activity), 
physical activity, or growth. These energy uses are labeled “K.” The remaining energy, labeled 
“1-K” (with 1 = 100%), may be used for developing and maintaining the reproductive system and 
for all aspects of reproduction (gamete production, mate acquisition, gestation, parental invest-
ment, etc.). For animal species practicing cooperative and communal breeding (Lukas & Clutton-­
Brock, 2012), and for human biocultural reproduction (below the broken line), there is an additional 
input of energy from social group members who directly contribute food or provide labor to breed-
ing females and to their offspring that reduces the energy expenditure of the breeding female 
(reduces her “K”). The helpers contribute to a “pool” of energy that is shared to enhance reproduc-
tive success. Nonhuman animals share the pooled energy with close genetic relatives. Humans 
share the pooled energy with both genetic kin and socially defined kin. Original figure, B Bogin

Stock, 2007), the evolution of language (Locke & Bogin, 2006a, b), and the increas-
ing size and complexity of social groups leading to brain and cognitive expansion 
(Burkart et al., 2009; Dunbar, 1998, 2009). Whatever the causes, and it is likely that 
all these and others were involved, the transition to biocultural reproduction proba-
bly coevolved with the biological, behavioral, cognitive, and linguistic characteris-
tics that coalesced with the appearance of Homo sapiens about 300,000 years ago, 
if not more recently, enabling humans to “stack” offspring into overlapping stages 
of development. By “stack” we mean that a mother may become pregnant when her 
current infant is nearing the end of lactation (around 30 months after birth) and may 
also have one or more other offspring.
It is important to note here that we are not discussing mating practices that take 
place within and outside of stable pair bonds and marriage. Rather, our focus is on 
cultural rules for the care and provisioning of offspring, regardless of their genetic 
relationship to the caregivers. Marriage and kinship-based rules include delegating 
responsibilities for feeding, clothing, housing, and educating the infants, children, 
and youth of the society, and often similar rules for the care of women of reproduc-
tive age.
The evolved nature of human pregnancy, birth, infancy, and the biocultural repro-
duction required to care for pregnant women and their offspring likely evolved syn-
ergistically with the foundations for human language and culture.
6.5  Infancy as the Most Social Stage
Earlier, we said that humans are more social than other species. Our claim here is 
that infancy is more social than other stages in life history, making it an unusually 
human time in our unusually social species. If we were approaching infancy from a 
purely experiential perspective, it would be easy to see why. Their first exposure to 
other humans begins prenatally, continues neonatally, and intensifies during infancy 
proper, when social stimulation is intimate and nearly continuous over a period of 
several years.
6.5.1  An Odd Asynchrony
One might suppose that everything that develops in infancy does so at the same rate, 
but this stage in human development is characterized by an oddly productive asyn-
chrony. It appears as an acceleration in the growth of one set of faculties twinned 
with a slower rate of development in another (i.e., heterochrony, see Bjorklund, 
Chap. 2, this volume). Infancy and human sociality are shaped by this combination 
of physical strengths and weaknesses, the proportions of which are unique to our 
species. Our young, we will suggest, are physically helpless at a time when it is 
advantageous for them, and our species, to be so.
J. L. Locke and B. Bogin

121
The odd juxtaposition of strengths and weaknesses that we will address here – 
the developmental equivalent of footprints and bones – involves motor abilities that 
emerge altricially, that is, perhaps a third or half of the way into infancy, and cogni-
tive abilities that appear much earlier, or precocially.
6.5.1.1  Motorically Altricial
Human infants are motorically altricial; they cannot walk, hunt, or forage, as many 
other animals are perfectly equipped to do. The range of variation in the age of 
achievement for six gross motor milestones is shown in Fig. 6.4. Some infants are 
more than 1-year-old before able to crawl or stand with assistance. In anything but 
a protective family environment, altriciality would pose considerable risk, but there 
are huge advantages to this state.
It seems paradoxical that we humans, so successful among living species, would 
be born unable to do many basic things, and to remain so, from grasping and crawl-
ing to climbing and walking. But this “design flaw” is one of our greatest strengths, 
for it produces a dependency that brings infants into near-constant contact with oth-
ers – even negotiations with others – at a time when their brain is receiving informa-
tion about others through the eyes, ears, nose, and skin. If a human is ever to be 
helpless, infancy seems to be the perfect time, for it sets in motion a reliance on 
others that, in succeeding stages, is likely to prove more beneficial than strict 
self-reliance.
In human evolution, a considerable portion of brain development was shifted into 
the postnatal period (see Bjorklund, Chap. 2; DeSilva, Chap. 3, this volume). 
Nevertheless, the human newborn’s head is relatively large, as the neonatal brain is 
bigger than that of any other primate (Leutenegger, 1974; Sacher, 1975). It is also 
large in relation to the maternal birth canal, meaning that birth must occur at a time 
in gestation when the head is small enough for safe passage. Why? Skeletal evi-
dence suggests that when early hominins began to stand erect and to walk – 4 to 7 
million years ago (mya) – pressures on the hip and pelvis were altered (LeBarre, 
1954, 1973). Since body weight is transmitted downward through the sacroiliac 
joint, and ground reaction is transmitted upward through the hip joint, torques are 
produced at these pressure points. Having the entire weight of the body on the hind 
limbs caused a ventral tilt of the pelvis and eventually shortened the distance 
between sacroiliac and hip joints (Leutenegger, 1974, 1980; Ward, 2002). While 
this made for more efficient bipedal locomotion, it created an “obstetrical dilemma” 
(Washburn, 1960; see Bjorklund, Chap. 2 and DeSilva, Chap. 3, this volume), inas-
much as it narrowed the birth canal, not an immediately adaptive change given 
expansions in the human brain and the newborn’s head (Dunbar 1992; also see 
Harvey & Clutton-Brock, 1985; Mithen, 1996).
Another problem for the mother is that the fetal brain is metabolically expensive, 
therefore a drain on her resources (Dunsworth et al., 2012). It is easier for the mother 
to meet the costs of infant brain growth via lactation, so long as the mother’s diet is 
enhanced, and her activity expenses reduced, which is exactly the scenario of the 
6  An Unusually Human Time: Effects of the Most Social Stage on the Most Social…

122
human type of hyper-cooperation of mother-infant care derived from BCR with its 
“pooled energy budget” to support mothers and feed infants, as described earlier.
The evolutionary solution to problems posed by these obstetrical and metabolic 
dilemmas was an earlier birth, one that occurs, according to Ashley Montagu (1961) 
and Stephen Jay Gould (1977), nine months too soon. It was a momentous solution, 
for if less of the infant’s brain growth occurred before birth, when infants were in a 
relatively asocial environment, and more of it would take place later, when they 
were in direct sensory contact with various individuals. Because of this, the modern 
infant’s brain does most of its forming during a protracted interval of intense social 
stimulation (see Bjorklund, Chap. 2, this volume).
Normally, helplessness would not seem to be a positive trait, but consider the 
alternative. The central nervous system of altricial animals is in a highly malleable 
and absorptive state during exposure to a variety of experiences. If newborns were 
able to wander off shortly after their birth, fully able to feed and protect themselves, 
they wouldn’t receive constant stimulation from others during a time when their 
brain is developing at a rapid rate, clearly a condition that favors social develop-
ment. One can hardly think of a developmental circumstance that would more favor-
ably affect the disposition to solve environmental problems socially.
Earlier, we referred to the fact that in a human infancy, there is an odd asyn-
chrony between the rate of motor development, which, as we have seen, occurs 
fairly slowly, and the rate of cognitive development, which occurs far more rapidly.
6.5.1.2  Cognitively Precocial
If the infant’s cognitive abilities were also immature, physical limitations would not 
be so socially advantageous, but they’re not delayed. In fact, they’re precocial. 
Within seconds of their birth, neonates begin – if they haven’t already begun – to 
take in indexical cues, that is, information about the sight, sound, smell, and feel of 
their mother, in effect, her sensory signature.
Newborns display a preference for the face of their mother within the first day or 
two days of postnatal life (Field et al., 1984; Bushnell, 2001), a reflection of the fact 
they are, at the moment of birth, drawn by visual patterns that look remotely like a 
face. In a study reported by Goren et al. (1975), nine-minute-old neonates, who had 
never seen an unmasked face, looked longer at a somewhat normal facial arrange-
ment than faces with inverted or scrambled features.
Breastfeeding neonates are very sensitive to their mother’s odor within two days 
of birth and can discriminate her from other women using olfactory cues alone 
(Balogh & Porter, 1986; Cernoch & Porter, 1985; MacFarlane, 1975; Porter 
et al., 1992).
In the first few days of extrauterine life, neonates display a preference for their 
mother’s voice to the voice of another mother (DeCasper & Fifer, 1980), a prefer-
ence that continues for at least 20–30 days (Mehler et al., 1978).

6.6  Prenatal Learning
6.6.1  The Ambient Life of a Fetus
The womb is a “sensational” place, one in which the fetus is exposed to stimulation 
in most if not all sensory modes, from auditory, thermal, and tactile to gustatory, 
olfactory, and vestibular (Andre et al., 2017). It also affords opportunities for move-
ment at a developmental stage in which much of the infant’s processing machinery 
is already turned on.
When it comes to physical activity, the fetus does not wait to be born. By 
15 weeks, ultrasonographers have been able to record as many as 16 fetal movement 
patterns that resemble those observed in newborns (de Vries et al., 1982). In one 
study, somersaults and lateral rotations, which require organized limb and body 
control, were observed during this period (Suzuki & Yamamuro, 1985).
Since humans are considered the most social species in the world, it is not sur-
prising that the human fetus seems ready to interact with others at birth, and it may 
even be ready to do so before birth. Using ultrasound, Umberto Castiello and his 
colleagues looked for evidence of social interactions in five twin pregnancies 
(Castiello et al., 2010). They observed a number of movements that appeared to be 
specifically aimed at the co-twin. In other twin research, it was found that between 
the 15th and 22nd weeks, prenatally, self-touching decreased and other-touching 
increased. This contact appeared to be intentional rather than accidental.
6.6.2  Very Early Experience
There is no shortage of books on human development with a subtitle such as Birth 
to Three or some other age. That’s understandable. At some point, certain behaviors 
have mostly developed and there is little left to say. Specifying a terminal age is 
understandable,  but why begin as late as birth? One assumes that it has something 
to do with the possibility of observation. Certainly, it should not be that birth is the 
beginning of development, which obviously has occurred since fertilization, and it 
should not be the onset of postnatal experience, including learning, for studies over 
the past several decades have established that the intrauterine environment is sensa-
tional during periods of development in which sensors are operative and the brain is 
receptive. There is something there to be learned.
The embryologist Gilbert Gottlieb was among the first to show that behaviors 
appearing early in life are not necessarily – and certainly not entirely – determined 
by genetic factors. Although his research was on ducks, not humans, his work is 
instructive. Gottlieb was aware that newly hatched chicks approached conspecific 
calls more often than heterospecific ones, and that this suggests an innate preference 
for conspecific vocalization. But Gottlieb noted that duck embryos are capable of 
hearing and vocalizing three days before hatching, while still in the shell. This could 
6  An Unusually Human Time: Effects of the Most Social Stage on the Most Social…

124
enable chicks to hear their own voice in the shell, then, after hatching, to approach 
the source of maternal vocalization simply because it sounded like their own.
To test this, Gottlieb used surgical glue to “devoice” some embryos but not oth-
ers. At hatching, control chicks showed the usual conspecific effect, but the vocally 
deprived chicks, as expected, approached conspecific and heterospecific sources 
equally often (Gottlieb, 1978). In the research to be reviewed below, we’ll encounter 
studies that were similarly empirical in their approach, equally open to innate and 
experiential effects.
Although there is little to see in the womb, it now appears that the human fetus 
has sensory access to maternal vocalization. But, how well can the fetus hear it? Can 
the fetus hear noises that originate within its mother? They can if she’s talking. The 
fetus can hear sounds across a frequency range that includes the more intense vocal 
sounds in the adult female voice (see an early review in Locke, 1993). That’s partly 
a function of the auditory sensitivity of the fetus in the final trimester of gestation 
and the fact that maternal vocalization radiates downward through soft tissues in the 
mother’s body.
6.6.3  Prenatal Learning of Maternal Vocalization
At various times, one of us has wondered why all national languages are spoken 
when it is clear that signed languages are learned just as readily and work nearly as 
well (Locke, 1998). One possibility, purely speculative, is that infants are born with 
a bias for the voice of its mother, therefore, vocalization itself. But how could such 
a bias be acquired before birth?
DeCasper and Fifer (1980) measured the nonnutritive sucking rate of day-old 
infants; during the same day, the mothers were tape-recorded while reading a chil-
dren’s story. Then, a computer was programmed to play the mother’s voice every 
time a neonate sucked with a longer (or shorter) than normal inter-burst interval, and 
another mother’s voice when the inter-suck interval was shorter (or longer) than the 
basal measurement. These newborn infants were, thus, in complete control of their 
listening material. DeCasper and Fifer found that they electively sucked at rates that 
exposed them to their own mother’s voice significantly more often than they sucked 
to the voice of another mother.
How did the infants acquire this bias in the first day? They didn’t. They already 
had it, but it didn’t arrive genetically; it was learned in utero. This was possible 
because infants, during the final trimester of gestation, are sensitive to indexical and 
prosodic cues in the maternal voice (DeCasper & Fifer, 1980; DeCasper & Spence, 
1986; DeCasper et al., 1994).
Prenatal exposure to maternal prosody may explain a postnatal listening prefer-
ence for the language spoken by the mother during pregnancy. In a study by Moon, 
Cooper, and Fifer (1993), it was found that newborns whose mothers had spoken 
Spanish or English during their pregnancies were presented with recordings of a 
different woman – a stranger – speaking one of these languages. Using a sucking 
J. L. Locke and B. Bogin

125
paradigm in which infants controlled the duration of spoken passages, infants main-
tained the passage read in their prenatal language longer than the other language, 
which implies prenatal learning. The mother’s tongue was on its way to becoming 
the infant’s mother tongue.
6.6.4  Neonatal Learning
Learning of maternal vocalization continues as learning of the native language. 
Mehler and his colleagues (1988; Bertoncini et al., 1989) found that at four days of 
age, babies born in Paris of French-speaking women preferred the sound of French 
to Russian. Babies whose mothers spoke a different language during pregnancy 
lacked this preference for French over Russian; indeed, they gave little evidence that 
they were even able to discriminate these languages.
As infants take in information about vocal characteristics of the ambient lan-
guage, they also store utterances. There is evidence of this as early as five months, 
when infants react unusually to their name (Mandel et al., 1995). Here, students of 
child language find something to explain, something relevant to the learning of 
words (Locke, 1997).
6.7  A Mind for Care
Earlier, we discussed the Social Brain Hypothesis, which attributes the size of the 
human brain to the number and complexity of cognitive operations associated with 
expanded and complex patterns of group living in adults. Here, we consider a sec-
ond hypothesis, the Infant Care Hypothesis, which attributes expansions in the brain 
and social cognition to intense socialization associated with evolutionary changes in 
human infancy. Unlike the Social Brain Hypothesis, the Infant Care Hypothesis is 
concerned with sociality itself, including issues addressed at the beginning of the 
chapter: the need to be around and to interact with others, and to enjoy the feeling 
of belonging (Baumeister & Leary, 1995).
6.7.1  Alloparents
In the first postnatal year, infants get a great deal of exposure to the mother, but 
when normal levels of maternal contact are unavailable or disrupted, neonates natu-
rally expand their focus to include other adults (Hittelman & Dickes, 1979). This, 
we suggest, augments the social stimulation that they need (Hrdy, 2016).
Anthropologist Sarah Hrdy once wrote that “new modes of child-rearing meant 
changing our minds” (Hrdy, 2016). Hrdy was referring to the fact that in 
6  An Unusually Human Time: Effects of the Most Social Stage on the Most Social…

126
evolutionary history (and in many places today), infant and child care was spread 
across multiple alloparents, not offered by the mother alone. To be successful, allo-
parental care required that infants’ and children’s, “…minds grow within the con-
text of their relationships with family … [and required] … revising our ideas about 
exactly who constituted ‘family’” (Hrdy, 2016, p. 23; see Hrdy & Burkart, Chap. 8, 
this volume). Hrdy’s claim was that the intense care and social bonding provided by 
multiple carers changed our species’ cognitive biases, emotional preferences, 
attachments to parental figures, and neuroendocrine profiles and networks (Burkart 
et al., 2009). These changes created new mental phenotypes that promote the ability 
and desire to adopt the perspective of others (i.e., shared intentionality, pretense, 
social kinship, and storytelling). Hrdy also suggested a “Mothers-Plus-Others” 
hypothesis for the new emotional capacities of our hominin ancestors, which pro-
moted human cognitive accomplishments distinguishing our species from the other 
primates (Hrdy, 2016).
Did intense parenting build our brains? For some reason, Hrdy left her hypothe-
sis as a thought experiment, though, like Dunbar, she did emphasize that social 
stimulation played a role in evolution of the size and complexity of the primate and 
human brain. Our Infant Care Hypothesis formally proposes that human infancy is 
a critical period of development for building the size and neurological complexity 
of the brain as well as the specifically human behavioral, cognitive, and emotional 
capacities required for biocultural reproduction, language, kinship, marriage, and 
related unique human cultural capabilities. It has long been known that infants 
reared in social isolation experience less brain growth, and are born with smaller 
heads, than those who are socially reared (Rutter et al., 2012; Sonuga-Barke et al., 
2017). There is an extensive literature dating as far back as 1701 that documents the 
evidence for the relationship between the psychosocial environment and human 
development (Peiper, 1955). Research in the twentieth century demonstrated the 
contribution of physical touch, intense social interaction, and love to physical and 
mental development (Spitz, 1945; Field, 1988, 2007; Goldschmidt, 2006; 
Rogol, 2020).
Here, we describe one recent natural experimental study by Mackes et al. (2020) 
showing the critical nature of social interaction during infancy to build a healthy 
human brain in both size and function. Mackes et al. imaged the brains of 67 young 
adults (mean age 25.3 years) who were exposed to severe deprivation as infants 
when confined to Romanian orphanages during the Ceaușescu era and then adopted 
by UK families. The Romanian adoptees suffered between 3 and 41  months of 
deprivation due mostly to being isolated in their cots, sometimes restrained so that 
they could lie in only one position. The infants’ only interactions with other people 
were confined to feeding, diaper changing, and bathing, which took place on a fixed 
schedule. The infants were not held, spoken or sung to, or consoled if crying.
Later, as young adults, these adoptees were compared with 21 nondeprived UK 
adoptees. The researchers reported that as adults, “Romanian adoptees had substan-
tially smaller total brain volumes than nondeprived adoptees (8.6% reduction), and 
total brain volume was strongly negatively associated with deprivation duration. 
This effect persisted after covarying for potential environmental and genetic con-
founds” (p.  641). The lower right inferior frontal surface area and volume of 
J. L. Locke and B. Bogin

127
adoptees were especially smaller and decreased in direct measure with deprivation 
duration. The adoptees had, “…both lower intelligence quotient (IQ) and higher 
levels of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms” (p. 641). These brain-­
structure deficits and cognitive-behavioral pathologies were incurred during a 
socially deprived infancy and could not be overcome despite the enrichment and 
treatment provided by adoptive families for at least two decades.
Human care of infants via biocultural reproduction optimizes infant brain growth 
and development and later social-cognitive behavior. We contend that the intense 
and socially diverse nature of human infant care not only prevents pathology but 
also stimulates greater brain growth of neurons, neuronal connections, neuroendo-
crine system, and the development of motor-social-cognitive-emotional capacities. 
While the Social Brain Hypothesis attributes a number of social-cognitive opera-
tions to the size of human groups, the advent of alloparenting – which increased the 
number of carers from one to many – was undoubtedly responsible for increases in 
the breadth of social stimulation received by human infants.
To us, the Social Brain Hypothesis makes more sense if it is linked to the Infant 
Care Hypothesis by way of biocultural reproduction. At all stages of development, 
brain size enlarged with increases in social group size, especially when there was a 
greater number of alloparents assisting with infants (as shown in a meta-analysis by 
Isler & van Shaik, 2012). In a classic feedback relationship, increases in the size of 
the fetal head contributed to earlier birth, increased infant helplessness, and more 
diverse alloparental care, intensifying social activity over a period of months and 
years at precisely the time when brain size increases at its fastest rate. This diversi-
fication of social stimulation by multiple alloparental carers undoubtedly broadened 
and intensified expectations of social stimulation and increased the motivation to 
solve problems by cooperating with others (Burkart et al., 2009).
6.8  Closing Thoughts
Members of our species are social before they are born – aware of and responsive to 
the presence and some activities of their mothers – and for reasons that we have 
discussed, the levels of social stimulation and interaction mightily increase in the 
months after birth, and continue, unabated, for several years thereafter. There can be 
little mystery that ours is considered the most social of all animal species.
We began this chapter by quoting zoologist Walter Garstang, who said that to be 
complete, accounts of human evolution must identify the environmental changes 
responsible for new traits in development, and the reasons why these traits would 
have conferred contemporaneous reproductive advantages. We took his words to 
mean that our task was both to discuss the evolution of infancy and the contribution 
of infancy, once evolved, to characteristics of our species, whenever they might 
appear. Toward that end, we discussed events, for example, bipedalism and pelvic 
realignment, that led to altered conditions of birth and care that may have contrib-
uted to enhanced sociality.
6  An Unusually Human Time: Effects of the Most Social Stage on the Most Social…

128
We emphasized especially the nature of human biocultural reproduction. BCR 
describes a suite of biological and sociocultural adaptations, including (1) cognitive 
capacities for nongenetically based marriage and kinship behavior that provide 
demographically and ecologically flexible, but culturally universal, alloparental 
care for infants; (2) early weaning, leading to an increased rate of reproduction for 
mothers; and (3) a life history phase of childhood, characterized by the absence of 
nursing but considerable ongoing nutritional dependence, creating extended needs 
for the provision of care by individuals other than the parents and opportunities for 
intense social interaction and an extended period for brain growth and development. 
Sometime in human evolution, possibly with the appearance of the first members of 
the genus Homo, there occurred a shift from the typical ape pattern of a unique 
attachment dependence between the infant and the biological mother to the human 
pattern, in which attachment is expanded outward to other members of the social 
group in a locally and culturally defined fashion via language and rules of kinship 
and marriage. It is this decoupling of allocare from genetic relatedness, more than 
anything, which sets humans apart from other cooperative breeding species. 
Biocultural reproduction with its intense and diverse infant care establishes the 
basis for all of human culture.
Within the more general BCR model, we developed a new understanding of con-
nections between the Social Brain and Infant Care Hypotheses. Where the Social 
Brain Hypothesis holds that social pressures related to group living enlarged the 
neocortex – brain space needed to support cognitive operations that occur in the 
adult mind – the Infant Care Hypothesis places a value on social stimulation emerg-
ing from infants’ receipt, even their own negotiation, of care, contributing to our 
species’ need to relate. In their study of allomaternal care across primate species, 
Burkart and her colleagues found “the extent of allomaternal care provides the best 
explanation for the distribution of proactive prosociality among primate species, 
including humans” (Burkart et al., 2014, p. 3).
In conclusion, our Infant Care Hypothesis, like the Social Brain Hypothesis, is 
based on changes in the socialization of our species. But ours has less to do with the 
evolution of minds, and more to do with the evolution of sociality itself – specifi-
cally, the motivation to socialize and to coordinate one’s own physical and mental 
activities with others. We suggest that our disposition to develop and apply our 
social, and social-cognitive, abilities is best developed during a human infancy, an 
unusually human time, the most social stage of the most social species.

in the Environment of Evolutionary 
Adaptedness 
Sybil L. Hart
Maternal caregiving of infants and infant–maternal bond formation are species-­
wide features of women and infants. This chapter addresses the origins of these two 
phenomena, and we begin by addressing maternal caregiving and by asking whether 
it has a particular form that is known for being presented universally, since this 
would offer clues as to the nature of a genetic mechanism that may be involved 
(Durant & Ellis, 2013; Geary, 2000). The outline of an answer emerges upon recog-
nizing that although styles of parenting differ across and within generations and 
cultures (Bornstein, 2002; Harkness & Super, 2002), breastfeeding has served as the 
primary source of infant nutrition throughout most of evolutionary history, which 
allows for conceptualizing it as a hard-wired feature of maternal caregiving. This 
interpretation of breastfeeding speaks to the possibility that beyond its contribution 
to caregiving, lactation may have been responsible for the inherited component of 
another species-wide phenomenon that involves mothers and infants, namely the 
psychological bond that links mothers and infants to each other. This possibility 
inspired us to approach the genetic basis of maternal caregiving and infant–maternal 
bond formation through inquiry into inherited features of lactation.
The chapter begins by focusing on aspects of lactation that are known to be 
inherited. These are physiological characteristics that are evident in contemporary 
nurslings and their mothers. This material is followed by sections on psychological 
features of lactation and the ecological conditions under which they arose. These 
conditions are believed to have been those that were inhabited by modern humans 
hundreds of thousands of years ago during the Pleistocene epoch, in settings known 
as the environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA). We then theorize on physi-
ological, psychological, and ecological features of lactation in the EEA, and the

way in which these could have coalesced so as to have underpinned universality in 
maternal caregiving of infants, the bond that links infants to their mothers, and that 
which links mothers to their infants. We follow with material on maternal caregiv-
ing and bond formation as features of the mother–weanling relationship, and con-
clude with suggestions for future research.
7.1  Nurslings as Proximate Influences 
on Maternal Caregiving
Insight into breastfeeding as a universal form of maternal caregiving can be gleaned 
by considering particular features that are responsible for its onset in present-day 
settings during the perinatal period. Breastfeeding does not happen immediately 
upon parturition. Even in the current era, it is not uncommon for neonates to lose 
weight during the first week of life. During this interval, maternal hormones, pri-
marily oxytocin and prolactin, already elevated prior to childbirth, increase further. 
Yet, the reflexive response, known as the let-down reflex, that is responsible for milk 
ejection does not take place without stimulation by an infant’s presentation of a 
behavioral repertoire that constitutes suckling. The repertoire involves an infant’s 
state of mental arousal that enables at least a low level of wakefulness, as well as 
reflexive movements of the head and mouth, including rooting, latching-on, suck-
ing, and swallowing (Lawrence & Lawrence, 2015; Riordan & Wambach, 2010). At 
times, the suckling repertoire is accompanied by bodily activity that has been 
described as a hunger reflex (Sugar, 1976), in which an infant will extend her arms 
and hands as she reaches for, touches, and strokes or grabs onto a woman’s body 
(Uvnas-Moberg, 2013). Suckling that is required for stimulating the mother’s 
release of prolactin leads to milk synthesis and the release of oxytocin, which causes 
contractions in breast tissue that force milk to be ejected.
In instances where there are long intervals between feeding sessions, milk syn-
thesis begins to decline. Therefore, frequent bouts of breastfeeding are important, 
not only for initiating lactation, but also for minimizing risk of insufficient milk 
syndrome. With prolonged interruption, milk synthesis comes to a complete halt 
that is usually irreversible. Without appropriate substitutes for breast milk, infants 
are placed at risk of faltering growth (Lawrence & Lawrence, 2015; Riordan & 
Wambach, 2010). Unlike other newborn reflexes that wither or are replaced within 
a few months of parturition, and unlike neonatal behaviors, such as imitation, that 
are present, but unreliable (Keven & Akins, 2016), behaviors responsible for suck-
ling are exceptionally robust. In fact, these reflexes are so robust that infants are 
routinely provided with commercially available pacifiers that are often in constant 
use, sometimes throughout the entire duration of infancy.
Breastfeeding has been linked with newborn and premature infants’ superior 
neurobehavioral functioning (Feldman & Eidelman, 2003; Hart et al., 2003, 2011). 
To some degree, these positive outcomes are attributable to their consumption of a 
suite of nutrients, growth factors, and hormones in breast milk that play a role in 
brain development (Belfort, 2017; Horta et  al., 2018; Purdy & Melwak, 2013; 
S. L. Hart

137
Reynolds, 2001). Essential fatty acids (EFAs), especially docosahexaenoic acid 
(DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA), are of importance to neurodevelopment by 
supporting myelination as well as synaptic and membrane function (Guesnet & 
Alessandri, 2011; Guxens et al., 2011; Innis, 2008). Greater concentrations of DHA 
in breast milk have been found associated with neonates’ superior ability to main-
tain optimal arousal (Hart et al., 2006), and with infants’ and toddlers’ heightened 
visual attention and reduced distractibility (Colombo et  al., 2004). In low- and 
middle-­income countries, where breastfeeding is less likely to be confounded by 
self-selection, longer durations of breastfeeding have been associated with chil-
dren’s greater academic attainment and higher IQ. In part, these dose–response rela-
tionships have been attributed to children’s prior consumption of DHA in breast 
milk (Prado & Dewey, 2014).
Cortisol is a hormone that is found in breast milk (Jonas et al., 2018; Neelon 
et al., 2015). Consistent with evidence that umbilical cord-blood levels of cortisol 
are associated with alertness in neonates (Bell et al., 2012), greater concentrations 
of cortisol in breast milk have been associated with superior behavioral regulation 
in neonates (Hart et al., 2004) and with amplified emotional reactivity in infants 
(Grey et al., 2013; Nolvi et al., 2018). Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) is an 
immunoprotein found in breast milk that has been linked with neonates’ superior 
ability to orient to social stimuli (Hart et al., 2004). Breast milk has also been linked 
with analgesic effects (Gray et al., 2002; Upadhyay et al., 2004), calming effects 
during infant exposure to painful procedures (Baudesson de Chanville et al., 2017; 
Nishitani et al., 2009), and more robust recovery during treatment for opioid expo-
sure (Bogen & Whalen, 2019; Welle-Strand et al., 2013).
These characteristics of breastfed infants translate into decreases in fussiness 
along with increases in eye contact and attentiveness, features that facilitate the 
infant’s capacity to orient to social stimuli and elicit adult attention in return (Beebe 
et al., 2005). Features that prompt caregiver attentiveness are especially effective 
when they include presentations of positive affect, which is a feature that amplifies 
the extent to which infants are found appealing by caregivers. Adults are receptive 
toward smiling by infants (Messenger, 2008; Strathearn et al., 2008), especially if 
the adults are lactating mothers (Krol et al., 2014). Reciprocally, infants with greater 
experience of breastfeeding are particularly receptive toward adult figures’ expres-
sions of happiness (Krol et al., 2015). With these capacities for social engagement, 
nurslings are able to communicate in a manner that prompts and reinforces caregiv-
ing, which is a notable achievement given that it takes place early in development, 
when infants are ill-equipped to do so in any other way.
In sum, the infant’s suckling repertoire is pivotal, not only to initiating breast-
feeding, but toward maintaining it as well. Some evidence suggests that the benefits 
of breast milk to infant health and general sense of well-being are augmented by 
constituents, including DHA, cortisol, and SIgA, that support infants’ cognitive 
functioning, and by features that boost pain tolerance, calmness, and resilience. 
These attributes enhance the infant’s capacity for sociality so as to heighten the abil-
ity to entice caregiver attention. Equipped in this manner, nurslings are active agents 
in the care that they enlist from their mothers, which establishes them as proximate 
influences on maternal caregiving.

7.2  Lactation-Based Cohesion
Milk production that is precipitated by infant suckling is notable in that it too is 
behavior that rests on physiological influences. Because the let-down reflex is an 
involuntary form of maternal parenting behavior, breastfeeding can be practiced 
even if a nursing mother is not fully cognizant of whether her infant is in need of 
care, nor the precise nature of care that is needed. For example, a lactating mother, 
even an inexperienced primipara, will breastfeed her infant even if she is not fully 
recovered from childbirth, nor fully awake. She would find that breastfeeding usu-
ally attenuates infant distress, and this would be the case even if she had failed to 
correctly identify whether her infant was distressed by hunger or by any number of 
other possible sources of distress that are often alleviated by breastfeeding.
What is more, lactation does not depend on maternal affect. Feelings of tender-
ness and affection are regular features of nursing mothers, but they are not necessary 
preconditions for a mother to decide to breastfeed. A mother can even feel disin-
clined to breastfeed, yet find that an untimely eruption of breast milk cannot be 
ignored for long. Once the let-down reflex triggers contractions, a mother’s breasts 
become swollen with milk and she has little choice but to suckle her infant. Unless 
she has access to a breast pump, failure to do so can result in engorgement and 
eventually to mastitis, an infection of breast tissue that causes fever and pain. 
Spontaneity in the milk ejection reflex is vividly illustrated once breastfeeding has 
been fully established, usually within a few weeks of parturition. From this point 
onward, the mere sound of an infant crying—that is, even without stimulation of 
suckling—is enough to trigger the let-down reflex (Lawrence & Lawrence, 2015; 
Riordan & Wambach, 2010).
Because milk removal by the infant precipitates milk synthesis by the mother, the 
ensuing relationship is characterized as bidirectional (Ventura & Terndrup, 2016). 
In literature on lactation, it is described as a “biological dialog” (Raju, 2011) that 
involves “cue-based co-regulated feeding” (Shaker, 2013; Thoyre et  al., 2013). 
These depictions speak to recognizing the nursling–mother relationship as a biobe-
havioral bond marked by cycles of bidirectional involvement that connect nurslings 
to their mothers much as they connect mothers to their nurslings. The reciprocal 
nature of the relationship denotes connectedness that we refer to as lactation-based 
cohesion.
7.3  Mothers’ Milk and Infant Survival in the EEA
Due to its biological underpinnings, lactation-based cohesion that arose in the EEA 
is likely to resemble the bonds that occur among contemporary breastfeeding dyads 
(Jonas & Woodside, 2016) and to operate in a manner that is similar to that seen in 
contemporary harsh environments where the rate of mortality in children is as high 
as it is understood to have been in the EEA, almost 50% (Volk & Atkinson, 2008, 
S. L. Hart

139
2013; see McDowell & Volk, Chap. 5, this volume). In countries marked by extreme 
poverty, mortality in children is greatest among those up to the age of 5 years, and 
the major cause of death is infectious disease, specifically, respiratory tract infec-
tions, followed by diarrheal diseases, HIV, and tuberculosis (Christian, 2008; 
Naghavi et al., 2017; see McDowell & Volk, Chap. 5). Due to the increased meta-
bolic demands that are imposed by disease, undernutrition independently worsens 
the outcomes of illness, which is why death rates among malnourished children are 
twice as high as those of well-nourished children. Among those who are severely 
malnourished, death rates are seven times greater (Alberda et  al., 2006; Bhutta 
et al., 2017; Worthman, 2010). Acutely malnourished children are also vulnerable to 
diseases, such as marasmus and kwashiorkor, that have etiologies that are specific to 
various types of severe nutritional deficiencies (de Onis, 2008; Prentice, 1991).
A major contributor to malnutrition in young children is premature weaning, that 
is, weaning of infants under the age of 4 years. Due to scarcity of energy- and 
nutrient-rich, easily digestible sources of nutrition, infants in this age range depend 
on breast milk for macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronu-
trients (vitamins, minerals, and trace elements). Furthermore, vulnerability to dis-
ease, which is typical of infants due to their immature immune systems, compels 
reliance on breast milk for its immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, and anti-­
inflammatory properties that provide passive resistance to disease. In environments 
marked by both nutritional deprivation and poorly functioning health systems, 2- 
and 3-year-old weanlings are exceptionally vulnerable to cognitive deficits associ-
ated with impaired brain structure and function, growth faltering, morbidity, and 
mortality (Black et al., 2015; Prado & Dewey, 2014).
Appreciation of conditions in present-day harsh environments leads to under-
standing the EEA as a setting where morbidity and mortality were especially preva-
lent among infants and children up to 5 years of age. The leading causes of death are 
likely to have been infectious diseases and malnutrition-related diseases. Due to 
food scarcity and the absence of health systems, it seems likely that the infants and 
young children who were able to survive did so with the benefit of nutrients and 
immunoprotective properties that they derived from consuming breast milk. Because 
dependence on breast milk lasted throughout the first 3 years of life, lactation-based 
cohesion must have been a species-wide feature of ancestral infant–maternal dyads 
that lasted approximately 3 years.
7.4  Ancestral Women and Infants
Physiological data for hunter-gatherer populations indicate that the metabolic costs 
involved in energy expenditure by ancestral hunter-gatherers resemble those of 
present-day Westerners (Pontzer et al., 2012), and so it seems likely that the meta-
bolic costs of lactation are also largely unchanged. In contemporary settings, these 
surpass those that are already elevated during pregnancy in that they involve further 
increases by 25% for energy needs, 54% for protein needs, and 0–93% for various 
7  Attachment and Caregiving in the Mother–Infant Dyad: Evolutionary…

140
vitamins and minerals (Dewey & Cohen, 2007). These costs are met by mothers 
increasing energy intake, by decreasing physical activity, and by utilizing existing 
stores of fat tissue that can jeopardize maternal nutritional status (Dufour & Sauther, 
2002; Quinn, 2016).
For ancestral mothers, the energy costs of breastfeeding are believed to have 
been so steep as to have placed them at increased risk of malnutrition. It is also 
notable that these women are believed to have breastfed throughout most of an inter-­
birth interval (IBI) that was soon followed by a subsequent pregnancy that would 
again lead to breastfeeding during most of the next IBI that was similar in duration 
(Davis, 1986; Konner & Worthman, 1980; White, 2014). Consequently, breastfeed-
ing resulted in increased risk of malnutrition that lasted throughout the majority of 
time when a 16- to 40-year-old ancestral woman was not pregnant, which amounted 
to almost the entire reproductive lifespan. These risks would have been exacerbated 
in cases where breastfeeding coincided with pregnancy, which requires energetic 
support for overlapping nutritionally dependent offspring, one a nursling the other a 
fetus (Conde-Agudelo et al., 2000; Ronsmans, et al., 2006).
In harsh present-day settings, women who give birth following an IBI of only 
9–14 months are 2.5 times less likely to survive childbirth than women who give 
birth following an IBI of 27–32 months (USAID, 2002). To some degree, these risks 
are offset by the effect of lactation on birth spacing (Berhan & Berhan, 2014; 
Kassebaum et al., 2014). In the EEA, where effective methods of contraception 
were nonexistent, lactation served as the only mechanism that played a role in regu-
lating fecundity, which it did by interfering with the release of hormones necessary 
for triggering ovulation, especially in undernourished women. By causing delay in 
a subsequent pregnancy, breastfeeding helped extend IBIs so that in most cases 
these could last as long as 4 years (Bocquet-Appel, 2011; Davis, 1986). In light of 
the magnitude of the costs to ancestral women as well as the time and energy that 
they allocated to breastfeeding, it can be argued that, much as it is recognized as a 
defining feature of ancestral infants (Geary & Bjorklund, 2000), breastfeeding 
deserves to be recognized as a defining feature of ancestral women.
Unlike the biology of lactation, which is largely unchanged, ecological factors 
that help sustain it have undergone changes over time. The most significant one took 
place during the Neolithic age, approximately 9000 BCE, with the emergence of 
agrarian villages where the adoption of plant and animal husbandry yielded alterna-
tives to breast milk. The domestication of certain mammals meant that animal milks, 
such as sheep’s and goats’ milk, were available to use as substitutes for breast milk. 
At the same time, the advent of agriculture yielded complementary foods, particu-
larly grains, such as maize, that were soft enough to be consumed by infants lacking 
full dentition (Bocquet-Appel, 2011; Howcroft et al., 2012). Since breastfeeding is 
likely to have entailed energy expenditure that placed ancestral mothers at increased 
risk of malnutrition, it is not surprising that they turned to substituting breast milk 
with animal milks and grains as soon as these options became available during the 
Neolithic age (Davis, 1986; Dettwyler, 1995; Ellison, 1995).
This had unfortunate implications for Neolithic-age toddlers. The availability of 
breast milk substitutes made it possible for mothers to lower the metabolic cost of 
S. L. Hart

141
lactation through the early introduction of complementary foods and by shortening 
the duration of breastfeeding to intervals that were less than 3 years. However, with-
out any alternative method of birth control, the IBI was not as well preserved, and 
so a subsequent pregnancy quickly ensued, along with heightened probability of 
depleted milk production, producing supplies of breast milk that were deficient in 
nutrient content, and premature weaning (Spielmann, 1989; Stuart-Macadam, 
1995). These outcomes of short IBIs contributed to the rise in rates of mortality in 
young children during the Neolithic era (Bocquet-Appel, 2011; Howcroft et al., 
2012), and they continue to do so in contemporary harsh environments (Bøhler 
et al., 1995; Dyson, 1977; Fotso et al., 2013; Khoshed et al., 2000). The detrimental 
impact of short subsequent IBIs, that is, the period of time from birth until a sib-
ling’s arrival, on toddler mortality has been well documented in public health and 
epidemiology reports. These frequently attribute it to undernutrition as a conse-
quence of premature weaning (Bøhler & Bergström, 1995; Jakobsen et al., 2003; 
Nath et al., 1994; Thapa et al., 1988). Tragically, this scenario is so prevalent that 
kwashiorkor is a word in the Ga language that literally means, “the disease the 
deposed baby gets when the next one is born” (Williams et al., 1935, p. 1151).
Until 9000 BCE, and throughout human and pre-human evolutionary history, our 
ancestors lived in pre-agrarian societies, made up of nomadic tribes of hunters and 
gatherers. They were still living in this way when the EEA arose, 200,000 to 
300,000  years ago (Galway-Witham & Stringer, 2018), with the appearance of 
modern Homo sapiens. In these societies, food sharing is thought to have been com-
monplace (Kaplan et  al., 2005), except when it came to sharing breast milk. 
Allomaternal breastfeeding could not have been customary since these thinly popu-
lated clans consisted of only approximately 50 persons including children (Eibl-­
Eibesfeldt, 1989; Narvaez et al., 2014), and so lactating mothers could not have 
been numerous. Moreover, the few who may have been present would have been 
reluctant to share a resource as precious and depleted as their breast milk because 
doing so would have come at a cost to their own infants’ viability (Hart, 2016a), 
which was a sacrifice that most women were unwilling to offer (Hrdy, 2007).
Grandmothers may have been willing to invest in their grandchildren (Hawkes 
et al., 1997; Sear et al., 2002) by breastfeeding (Williams, 1933). Although this may 
have provided infants with comfort, it is difficult to see how a possibly undernour-
ished ancestral grandmother who had reached reproductive senescence could have 
had much to offer in the way of nutrition. Younger, premenopausal grandmothers 
were more likely to produce breast milk, but they would have reserved it for infants 
of their own. Lactating women who were childless, usually as a consequence of 
infant mortality, were the most likely candidates for providing dedicated service as 
wet nurses, in that doing so would not have imperiled any biological offspring. 
However, these women would have been scarce (Dettwyler, 1995; Stuart-Macadam, 
1995). Even in contemporary traditional societies, allomaternal breastfeeding is not 
normative (Hewlett & Winn, 2014) and is usually limited to cases where it has been 
compelled by perinatal morbidity and mortality (Terashima, 2014). In a similar 
vein, reports on behavior of primates include observations that langur mothers 
rarely suckled infants other than their own offspring (Hrdy, 1977). Consequently, it 
7  Attachment and Caregiving in the Mother–Infant Dyad: Evolutionary…

142
seems likely that an ancestral infant’s own mother was his sole source of breast milk 
(Hart, 2016a).
Taken together, lactation was costly for ancestral women, but it also helped delay 
a subsequent pregnancy. Doing so benefited ancestral toddlers’ chances of survival 
by helping preserve the IBI. This interval was crucial to toddlers’ survival since 
threat posed by a newborn sibling (Bjorklund, Chap. 2, this volume; Bjorklund & 
Ellis, 2014; Myers & Bjorklund, 2018; Hart, Chap. 15, this volume; Salmon & 
Hehman Chap. 9, this volume; Trivers, 1974) was forestalled during the IBI, which 
gave toddlers protection against competition with a newborn sibling while they 
were at an age when being deprived of breast milk placed them at increased risk of 
malnutrition, morbidity, and mortality. For ancestral toddlers, this nature of risk 
would have been inevitable in that the ever-present risks of hunger and disease were 
exacerbated by having to give up mothers’ milk to another child, and in most cases, 
the other child was a newborn sibling. Given the energetic cost of milk synthesis 
and the limited availability of healthy breast milk substitutes and allomaternal 
breastfeeding, a closely spaced subsequent pregnancy presented undernourished 
ancestral mothers with the dilemma of having to sustain two offspring with a supply 
of breast milk that was adequate for only one. To avoid placing both at risk, they 
would have chosen to suckle only one, and the one they usually chose was the more 
vulnerable newborn infant rather than the toddler.
Finally, it is conceivable that by causing delay in a subsequent pregnancy, breast-
feeding benefited ancestral toddlers’ chances of survival by preserving the IBI as a 
period of time during which they retained some protection against the lethal ramifi-
cations of fast reproductive pace. In the absence of protection against short inter-
pregnancy intervals (IPIs), toddlers were placed at increased risk of morbidity and 
mortality by finding themselves, not only malnourished and vulnerable to disease, 
but also motherless.
7.5  Lactation-Based Caregiving
The benefits of breastfeeding to ancestral infants’ survival that stemmed from con-
suming breast milk and extending the IBI are likely to have been augmented by 
benefits that relate to the quality of maternal caregiving. Recall that the let-down 
reflex can be triggered in a lactating mother simply upon hearing her infant cry. In 
fact, her infant’s scent or the mere thought that her infant might be hungry are 
enough to trigger the reflex. Amazingly, the stimulus infant does not even have to be 
her own child (Gallup Jr et al., 2010). Given that medical complications of malnutri-
tion and malnutrition-related disease were the leading causes of death, it is difficult 
to overstate the significance of this manner of maternal responsivity.
Involuntary responsivity of this nature corresponds with findings on voluntary 
forms. Studies that have included controls for confounds that stem from self-­
selection, such as maternal age, education, income, and marital status, have consis-
tently observed breastfeeding mothers’ heightened responsivity to their infants’ 
S. L. Hart

143
cues (Britton & Gronwaldt, 2006; Edwards et al., 2015; Else-Quest et al., 2003). 
The problem of self-selection has also been addressed in research that examined 
dose–response effects. Greater breastfeeding has been associated with greater 
maternal sensitivity (Smith & Ellwood, 2011; Tharner et al., 2012; Weaver et al., 
2018). In a different line of work, several studies reported lower incidences of child 
maltreatment in cases where the perpetrators were or had been breastfeeding moth-
ers (Kelly et al., 2017; Kremer & Kremer, 2018; Strathearn et al., 2009). These 
studies followed earlier reports that linked breastfeeding with lower incidence of 
infant abandonment (Buranasin, 1991; Lvoff et al., 2000).
The basis of such protectiveness is poorly understood (Ventura, 2017), though 
several possible mechanisms have been entertained. Lactation has been associated 
with greater attentional bias to infant distress (Pearson et al., 2011). The neurologi-
cal underpinnings of such responsivity were illuminated in work by Kim and associ-
ates (Kim et al., 2011) who found that when exposed to the sound of their infants 
crying, mothers who breastfed differed from formula-feeding mothers by showing 
greater activation in regions of the brain that are linked with sensitivity during 
mother–infant interactions. Breastfeeding has also been associated with feelings of 
greater calmness, reduced symptoms of anxiety, and depression (Groër, 2005; 
Mezzacappa et al., 2005; Mezzacappa & Katkin, 2002), and heightened resilience 
following mistreatment (Kendall-Tackett et al., 2013; Miller-Graff & Scheid, 2019). 
Breastfeeding mothers who suffer from depression are less inclined to exhibit intru-
sive parenting behavior and to perceive their nurslings unfavorably (Field et al., 
2002, 2010). Such indices of emotional well-being have been found to correspond 
with physiological underpinnings that include superior cardiac vagal tone modula-
tion, lower blood pressure, and reduced heart rate reactivity (Hahn-Holbrook et al., 
2011; Mezzacappa et al., 2005; Quigley et al., 2017). In a similar vein, atypical EEG 
patterns that can characterize depressed mothers have been absent in depressed 
mothers who breastfeed (Hambali et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2016). Breastfeeding is 
also associated with the neuropeptide oxytocin. Elevated levels of this hormone 
have been associated with maternal responsivity to infant distress (Kim et al., 2014), 
and with lactating women’s lower symptoms of depression and anxiety (Stuebe 
et  al., 2013). More generally, oxytocin has been associated with the proclivity 
toward the formation of social bonds (Dozier, 2000; Feldman et al., 2007; Swain 
et al., 2014).
Breastfeeding has also been associated with heightened maternal responsivity to 
infants’ positively valenced cues, specifically smiling (Krol et al., 2014). Infants’ 
full cheeks are thought to act as a stimulus that prompts adults to provide caregiving 
(Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1989; Glocker et al., 2009). It seems likely that in cases where the 
adult happened to be an ancestral infant’s lactating mother, she would have provided 
caregiving by breastfeeding. In addition, she may have interpreted her nursling’s 
full cheeks as a sign that it had been because of her milk that her infant was thriving. 
Sentiment of this nature has been identified as a factor that motivates mothers of 
infants with compromised health status to continue to breastfeed despite the obsta-
cles involved in doing so (Rossman et al., 2013). This possibility resonates with the 
construct of breastfeeding self-efficacy—the breastfeeding mother’s confidence in 
7  Attachment and Caregiving in the Mother–Infant Dyad: Evolutionary…

144
her ability to nurture her infant. In contemporary settings, it is a predictor of pro-
longed lactation (Blyth et al., 2002; Thomas-Jackson et al., 2016), and so it may 
have operated comparably in ancestral settings.
In sum, the breastfeeding mother’s manner of caregiving of nurslings is notable 
for being characterized by greater responsivity to infant hunger, distress, and posi-
tive emotionality, as well as by lower risk of child maltreatment and abandonment. 
These patterns highlight lactation as a protective influence on the quality of mater-
nal caregiving. Efforts to explain such protectiveness have pointed to higher vagal 
tone and neuroendocrine substrates of lactation that are associated with activation in 
regions of the brain that are linked with sensitivity during mother–infant interac-
tions, and with the breastfeeding mother’s more positive mood, feelings of calm-
ness, resilience, and attentional bias to infant distress. Increases in the breastfeeding 
mother’s release of oxytocin have been associated with maternal responsivity to 
infant distress, lower symptoms of depression and anxiety, and may enhance the 
proclivity toward the formation of social bonds with her infant.
Associations of this nature lead to conjecture that the neuroendocrine profile of 
lactation is a mechanism that is responsible not only for breast milk synthesis and 
built-in forms of maternal responsivity, as in the let-down reflex, but also for sup-
porting voluntary behavior characterized by receptiveness to nurslings as proximate 
stimuli of caregiving. Thus, we posit the construct of lactation-based caregiving to 
capture maternal caregiving of nurslings that is delineated by presentations of vol-
untary and involuntary responsivity to infant cues that are underpinned by physio-
logical features of lactation. Furthermore, we submit that lactation-based caregiving 
must have been a salient feature of mothers of infants in the EEA. Given the steep 
costs of breastfeeding, its neuroendocrine underpinnings are likely to have operated 
as protective influences that factored into an ancestral woman’s decision to breast-
feed, rather than abandon, her infant.
7.6  Lactation-Based Caregiving and Cohesion Come 
to Conclusion
Unlike infants, for whom breastfeeding came with few, if any, costs, lactation was 
costly for ancestral mothers, and so it is not surprising that in most cases it was 
terminated, not by infants, but by their mothers upon deciding that it was time for 
weaning to come to conclusion. As we have shown, that decision would have had 
serious implications for ancestral infants’ chances of survival. Therefore, it is 
thought that unless weaning was compelled by a subsequent pregnancy, an ancestral 
mother was likely to concede to her nursling’s demand for prolonged breastfeeding. 
However, she would do so only until the appearance of a sign of her infant’s readi-
ness for being fully weaned (Dettwyler, 1995; Stuart-Macadam, 1995).
By nurslings’ third year, maturation of their digestive and immune systems 
would have reduced their dependence on breast milk for nutrition and passive

immunity to disease. Of course, ancestral mothers would not have been aware of 
such maturation. However, they would have been aware of the eruption of their 
nurslings’ permanent molar teeth. Since nursing mothers must teach their infants 
how to suckle without biting, ancestral mothers would have been keenly aware of 
maturation in their infants’ dentition. It has been suggested that the appearance of 
full dentition was interpreted by ancestral mothers as a sign that their infants were 
now able to consume the available solid foods, such as meat, roots, and nuts, that 
were difficult to chew without molar teeth. At this point, it would have been appar-
ent that their infants’ metabolic requirements could be satisfied without breast milk, 
which allowed mothers to bring weaning to conclusion (Dettwyler, 1995; Humphrey, 
2010; Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6, this volume).
Remarkably, an observable sign of readiness for weaning, molar teeth, happened 
to appear just as ancestral infants’ physiological dependence on breast milk sub-
sided. The overlap in timing may not have been purely by chance (Bjorklund, 2015; 
Bjorklund & Yunger, 2001; see Bjorklund, Chap. 2, this volume). Rather, it may 
have been a reflection of an evolved sequence of developments that arose so as to 
promote infant survival by influencing the timing of weaning so that it would not 
come to conclusion until infants’ digestive and immune systems had matured to the 
point when breast milk was no longer essential to their survival.
7.7  The Cradle of Attachment
So far in this chapter we have shown that in ancestral times all mothers breastfed 
their infants, and all infants depended on their mothers’ milk for at least 3 years. 
While promoting infant survival by providing nutrition, passive resistance to dis-
ease, and extended IBIs, breastfeeding generated a biobehavioral bond, lactation-­
based cohesion, arising as a species-wide feature of infant–maternal dyads. We now 
turn to asking whether 3 years of lactation-based cohesion could have been respon-
sible for the ontogenesis of a type of bond that could withstand being untethered to 
lactation.
Insight into this issue can be gleaned by considering how ancestral nurslings 
could have derived psychological benefits from ecological factors associated with 
breastfeeding. Skin-to-skin body contact and heat transfer are inherent features of 
lactation that would have engendered feelings of comfort and positive hedonic sen-
sations. These sensations would have been especially salient when experienced 
within the context of bed-sharing, a practice that was universal among ancestral 
nursing dyads and one that would translate into extended periods of time during 
which infants experienced feelings of intimacy (Field & Hernandez-Reif, 2012; 
Thoman, 2006; Uvnas-Moberg, 2013). Bed-sharing is also believed to have encour-
aged feelings of safety. Given the degree to which ancestral individuals were at risk 
of predation, the need for relief from fearfulness would have been especially acute 
during nighttime, when darkness and cold would have amplified feelings of vulner-
ability. Indeed, work has shown that when infants were exposed to an eliciting 
7  Attachment and Caregiving in the Mother–Infant Dyad: Evolutionary…

146
condition where they were separated from their mothers, which is a situation that is 
thought to elicit fear, those with history of breastfeeding and co-sleeping exhibited 
lower cortisol reactivity, suggesting superior ability to regulate fearfulness (Beijers 
et al., 2013).
Since ancestral mothers suckled only one infant at a time (Hart, 2016a), nurs-
lings would have experienced contact with their mothers within contexts that were 
characterized by exclusivity, or at least a degree of contact that was unparalleled by 
other children. For nurslings, such priority could have engendered expectations of 
privileged status in the infant–maternal relationship (Hart, 2016b, 2018; Chap. 15, 
this volume). Perhaps by signifying promise of fidelity, privileged status allayed 
deep-seated fears of abandonment that have been noted in young children (Mahler 
et  al., 1975; Winnicott, 1964, 1977). It is also possible that such status infused 
infants with feelings of “specialness,” a sense that is thought to characterize the 
breastfeeding relationship (Bottorf, 1990, p. 208), while also constituting a core 
feature of the construct of attachment (Cohen, 1974, p. 207).
Consequently, breastfeeding exposed ancestral nurslings to a constellation of 
pleasurable sensations. In addition to satiety, physical well-being, and enjoyment of 
breast milk’s sweet taste that stemmed from ingesting breast milk, ecological fea-
tures of breastfeeding endowed infants with psychological experiences of intimacy, 
exclusivity, safety, and comfort. The salience of such exposure can be appreciated 
further by recognizing that an overarching feature of lactation relates to the simple 
fact that breastfeeding commands close physical contact between mothers and 
infants. In ancestral times, where technologically advanced options, such as tube 
feeding, were nonexistent, the only way of delivering breast milk to infants was by 
breastfeeding, and so close physical contact with mother was compulsory. Recall 
too that until the Neolithic age, lactation was conducted intensively, in that it was 
practiced without supplementation by breast milk substitutes, such as formula or 
animal milks, without the assistance of allomaternal nursing, and absent separations 
between mother and infant that were long enough to either interfere with the moth-
er’s ability to maintain her supply of breast milk or cause her discomfort of engorge-
ment. Therefore, ancestral nurslings would have had proximal contact with their 
mothers that is stunning, not only for the extent to which it entailed profoundly 
satisfying physical and psychological sensations, but also for the sheer magnitude 
of its regularity and enduringness throughout periods that lasted several years.
7.8  Transition from Lactation-Based Cohesion 
to Child-­to-Mother Attachment
Proximal contact with a caregiver is widely recognized as the basis of a psychologi-
cal bond, known as attachment (Simpson & Jaeger, Chap. 11, this volume). Notably, 
this feature of infants is not evident at birth. Rather, it unfolds through a develop-
mental process that takes place during the first three years of life (Bowlby, 1973). 
S. L. Hart

147
The importance of proximal contact during this time frame has been amply demon-
strated in contemporary settings in situations where infants have been separated 
from their mothers. Such circumstances have been met by infants demonstrating 
separation protest, followed by despair. The most serious consequences occur in 
cases involving, “very prolonged or repeated separation during the first three years 
of life” (Bowlby, 1973, p. 12), whereupon infants demonstrate detachment, a state 
in which any feelings of connectedness have been relinquished. These observations 
echoed earlier reports (Heinicke & Westheimer, 1966; Robertson & Robertson, 
1971) that for “the normal 2-year-old, being placed in a residential nursery, even if 
only temporarily, is very likely to be experienced as a traumatic event” (Heinicke & 
Westheimer, 1966, p. 4). An evolved basis of infants’ vulnerability to trauma of 
separation from attachment figures was addressed in cross-cultural research (Kagan 
et al., 1978). This work revealed that separation protest is a universal phenomenon, 
which points to the involvement of an inherited mechanism in the process through 
which infant–caregiver attachment unfolds.
Insight into this mechanism can be gleaned by considering that, as discussed 
earlier in this chapter, the zero-to-three age range was also the time frame during 
which ancestral infants were vulnerable to the leading causes of mortality: malnutri-
tion and morbidity. The overlap in timing raises the possibility that the infant’s 
psychological vulnerability to trauma of separation and the physiological vulnera-
bility to starvation and disease arose in tandem, not by chance, but rather as 
coevolved mechanisms due to their adaptive function during this time frame 
(Bjorklund, 2015; Bjorklund & Yunger, 2001; see Bjorklund, Chap. 2, this volume). 
Importantly, each type of vulnerability would have been adaptive by eliciting care-
giving, yet the manners of caregiving were distinctive of each other. Whereas psy-
chological vulnerability to trauma of separation compelled dependence on caregivers 
who were able and willing to provide proximal contact and emotional support 
(Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bowlby, 1969/84), physiological vulnerability to malnutri-
tion and morbidity compelled dependence on caregivers who were able and willing 
to provide breast milk.
Most likely, these disparate manners of caregiving came to be paired with each 
other via a cascade of events in which 3 years of proximal contact with a caregiver 
that infants required in order to form bonds of attachment were mandated by the 
3-year period during which they required breast milk in order to survive. In turn, the 
3-year period during which infants required breast milk was assured by the timing 
of the eruption of molar teeth. Because molar teeth were necessary in order for 
infants to be able to chew the available foods, and because molar teeth did not 
appear until infants approached their third year, an ancestral mother’s only way to 
address her infant’s nutritional needs was by breastfeeding for 3 years. Because 
contact with an ancestral breastfeeding mother entailed steady and enduring expo-
sure to a constellation of profoundly satisfying sensations, mental representations of 
mothers as emotionally available caregivers are likely to have ensued. Plausibly, 
these representations permeated infants’ experiences of the biobehavioral bond that 
we refer to as lactation-based cohesion so as to have spawned child-­to-­mother 
attachment.
7  Attachment and Caregiving in the Mother–Infant Dyad: Evolutionary…

As a relationship born of proximal contact, child-to-mother attachment would 
have resembled attachment relationships with caregivers other than mothers 
(Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bowlby, 1969/84). However, it would have also been dis-
tinguished by at least two features. Crying is known to serve as an elicitor of care-
giving (Bowlby, 1969/84) that is easily prompted by sensations of hunger. However, 
unlike threatening stimuli, such as environmental danger, that can also trigger cry-
ing, hunger is perceived endogenously, and so infants are aware of it from the 
moment of birth. Furthermore, unlike other kinds of endogenously experienced 
aversive stimuli, such as coldness or fatigue, hunger is encountered inevitably, fre-
quently, and at regular intervals. The earliness and inevitability of regularly perceiv-
ing hunger coincides with infants’ innate ability to act on hunger cues. Of course, 
hunger cues that trigger crying also trigger sucking, and both behaviors are among 
a number of responses, such as clinging and following, that are recognized as 
proximity-­promoting behaviors through which infants initiate contact with a care-
giver and invite engagement in a manner that precedes attachment (Ainsworth et al., 
1978; Bowlby, 1969/84). However, whereas clinging and following are behaviors 
that become operative only after several months of development, crying and sucking 
are within the repertoire of neonates. In most cases, it is demonstrated immediately 
upon parturition.
Thus, hunger prompted earlier and steadier effort to elicit caregiving from moth-
ers than from other caregivers. In fact, using olfactory cues, breastfed neonates rec-
ognize their mothers within the first 48 hours of life (Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6, this 
volume; Porter et al., 1992). The head start and greater activity along the pathway 
toward attachment to mother versus the pathways toward attachments to various 
alloparents would have lent the mother-directed pathway prominence during the 
period responsible for the onset of hallmarks of attachment, separation protest and 
jealousy protest, becoming evident by as early as an infant’s ninth month (Ainsworth 
et al., 1978; Bowlby, 1969/84; Hart, 2016a, 2018; see Hart, Chap. 15, this volume). 
Also, regardless of whether it was cued by hunger, crying must have been an espe-
cially effective stimulus  of caregiving when it was directed toward an infant’s 
mother. Unlike most alloparents, who could opt to ignore crying without inflicting 
pain upon themselves, mothers of infants could ignore crying only until the let-­
down reflex was triggered. At that point, the biology of lactation would have been 
responsible for increasingly severe discomfort of engorgement that was difficult to 
alleviate without breastfeeding (Lawrence & Lawrence, 2015; Riordan & 
Wambach, 2010).
In sum, we propose that child-to-mother attachment originated as an outgrowth 
of lactation-based cohesion via a pathway that was unique by being embedded 
within the context of lactation as practiced in the EEA. In this context, ancestral 
nurslings were guaranteed of steady exposure to a constellation of profoundly satis-
fying psychological and physiological sensations throughout periods that lasted 
approximately 3 years, starting from the very moment of birth. Because such expe-
rience was specific to contexts that included infants’ mothers and because it is likely 
to have engendered mental representations of mothers as emotionally available 
caregivers, we theorize that over deep time it accounted for a psychological bond,

child-to-mother attachment, arising as the only child–caregiver relationship that is 
recognized as a species-wide phenomenon.
7.9  Caregiving of Weanlings 
and Mother-­to-Child Attachment
The point at which weaning came to conclusion marked a transition that was piv-
otal, not only for ancestral weanlings, but for their mothers as well. In the EEA, the 
juncture would have happened after 3 or more years of breastfeeding at substantial 
energetic costs for undernourished ancestral women. Earlier in this chapter, we 
argued that these costs were of such magnitude that it seems unlikely that these 
women could have borne them without support that they derived from the neuroen-
docrine profile of lactation. As the foundation of lactation-based caregiving, the 
profile would have served for years as a protective influence not only on involuntary 
forms of caregiving, but on voluntary forms as well. Hence, it is conceivable that the 
loss of such support upon the conclusion of weaning was problematic.
Even in contemporary settings, mothers have been known to be perturbed at this 
juncture. For some, perturbations stem from hormonal changes involved in postlac-
tational mammary gland involution, the physiological process during which the 
breast changes from a milk-producing organ to one that is largely quiescent (Gallup 
Jr et al., 2010). Others have been known to worry that without a dependable parent-
ing strategy that they had relied on for attenuating infant distress, future efforts to 
provide responsive care would falter. Mothers have also been troubled by the pos-
sibility of experiencing sense of loss resulting in symptoms akin to postpartum 
depression. Some have expressed concerns over lesser feelings of calmness that had 
coincided with the release of oxytocin (Bottorf, 1990; Parsons, 1978; Susman & 
Katz, 1988), and diminished experiences of skin-to-skin contact and related sensa-
tions, such as infant odor (Fleming et al., 1993; Lundström et al., 2013; Okamoto 
et al., 2016), that had been sources of pleasure. Concerns of this nature amount to 
fears that weanlings differ from nurslings in terms of their ability to function as 
proximate stimuli on maternal caregiving.
These issues point to the possibility that the transition to caring for weanlings 
would have been especially problematic in environments as harsh as the 
EEA. Granted, caregiving of weanlings was less costly than lactation-based care-
giving of nurslings, but it was still demanding and impactful. Rates of mortality in 
children are thought to have remained high until children’s fifth year, and so child 
survival was still at stake (Eshed et al., 2004; McDowell & Volk, Chap. 5, this vol-
ume). Thus, in order to see to their children’s survival and ultimately their own 
reproductive success and inclusive fitness (Salmon & Hehman, Chap. 9, this vol-
ume), it is not unreasonable to postulate that ancestral mothers required some source 
of support to help sustain behavior as demanding as caring for weanlings. We sub-
mit that source of support was mother-to-child attachment, a construct that we

150
define as a psychological mechanism that bound ancestral mothers to their former 
nurslings. In most cases, this would have been an affectional bond, and although it 
operated outside the context of lactation, it is construed as a mechanism that was 
forged during several years of lactation-based cohesion.
Mother-to-child attachment would have underpinned attachment-based caregiv-
ing, a psychological foundation that replaced biological underpinnings for uphold-
ing caregiving at the juncture when an ancestral mother transitioned from caring for 
a nursling to caring for a weanling. Notably, in non-contracepting premodern soci-
eties where mothers breastfed throughout most of an IBI, the interval between 
weaning one infant and giving birth to another would not have been lengthy (White, 
2014). As is the case at times in contemporary societies (Konner & Worthman, 
1980), a woman could have been breastfeeding one infant and gestating another at 
the very same time. This scenario leads to conjecture that the transition to attach-
ment-based caregiving could have posed challenges for ancestral mothers. Like 
contemporary mothers, they may have feared that the quality of care would be 
impaired by hormonal changes, feelings of loss of connectedness that had been 
ensured during 9 months of pregnancy and several years of breastfeeding, and anxi-
ety over the prospect of having to parent absent support they had derived from vari-
ous biological and ecological features of lactation. However, the substantiveness of 
these troubles would have been offset by occurring only during intervals when they 
were not breastfeeding—and these intervals were years apart and relatively brief, 
possibly as brief as 9 months, or even less.
During these intervals, attachment-based caregiving that was provided to wean-
lings would have been distributed among weanlings’ older siblings. In such cases, 
ancestral mothers must have realized that it was impossible to satisfy every child’s 
needs. Nevertheless, such concerns are likely to have been allayed upon realizing 
that children would not be harmed by the dilution of maternal resources since the 
children’s needs could be met by alloparents (Apicella & Crittenden, 2015; Hrdy, 
2005; Hrdy & Burkhart, Chap. 8, this volume; Henry & Morelli, Chap. 10, this 
volume). Overall, these conditions speak to conceptualizing mother-to-child attach-
ment as a mechanism that was important toward upholding maternal caregiving. 
However, it would have been an infrequently tapped mechanism that could have 
taken as long as 3 years to unfold. Once in effect, it would have underpinned care-
giving that was distributed among any number of weanlings and older offspring 
who, having access to alternative sources of care, were likely to have been able to 
survive even if the quality of maternal care was compromised by maternal vulner-
ability to symptoms of anxiety, depression, and perturbation stemming from hor-
monal changes. Depending on the quality and availability of allomaternal caregivers, 
some of these children may have been able to survive without the benefit of mater-
nal caregiving altogether (Sear et al., 2002).
As a form of caregiving that could have been infrequently adopted, slow to 
unfold, diluted among several offspring, at times unreliable, and advantageous but 
not imperative to child survival, attachment-based caregiving departed substantially 
from its roots in lactation. Recall that there were no substitutes for lactation-based 
caregiving. It would have commenced with minimal delay upon parturition and, 
S. L. Hart

151
being reserved for a single nursling, it was not diluted among several offspring. 
Furthermore, the ancestral mother’s supply of breast milk could not be maintained 
without suckling at regular intervals, which rendered lactation-based caregiving so 
reliable that it was essentially guaranteed. Arguably, it was as robust as any form of 
behavior that is known to have been evident in ancestry. At the very least, it was 
more reliable than attachment-based caregiving.
To be clear, breastfeeding was integral to maternal parenting of infants—but only 
after a mother had arrived at the decision to breastfeed, which was not guaranteed. 
Disinvestment, as in maternally perpetrated infanticide, was not unknown (Bjorklund 
& Jordan, 2013; Hausfater & Hrdy, 2017), which has led to thought that “there is no 
maternal instinct of a kind that ensures a new mother will provide appropriate care 
for her infant” (Bjorklund & Jordan, 2013, p. 69). In line with this formulation, we 
are suggesting that conditions in the EEA were such that a mother had no choice but 
to breastfeed if she wanted her infant to survive, and that desire could have been 
motivated neither by instinct nor by love, but rather by a practical reckoning of 
cost–benefit trade-offs concerning her health, her opportunities for reproduction, 
her ability to provision, and to retain the resources of her male partner (Salmon & 
Hehman, Chap. 9, this volume). However, once the decision to breastfeed was 
made, it is our position that it would have commanded lactation-based caregiving 
and cohesion which foretold a pathway toward mother-to-child attachment.
7.10  Conclusions and Suggestions for Future Research
In this chapter, we have shown that the life stage of infancy can be defined as the 
3-year period of ancestral infants’ dependence on caregiving that was provided spe-
cifically by their mothers. It would have been bracketed by a newborn’s cries of 
hunger at the moment of birth, and approximately 3 years later by the eruption of 
full dentition that signaled readiness for weaning. At that juncture, physical matu-
rity in infants’ digestive and immune systems, which released them from depen-
dence on their mothers for breast milk, coincided with psychological maturity, 
which released them from reliance on their mothers for proximal contact. The con-
vergence of physical and psychological maturation would have represented a turn-
ing point marked by the conclusion of breastfeeding along with its fitness payoffs 
for infants: protection against starvation and disease, preservation of the IBI as a 
haven against usurpation by a newborn sibling, and the  psychological benefits 
of  exposure to the constellation of profoundly satisfying experiences  that were 
inherent features of lactation-based caregiving and cohesion.
We also recognize this time frame as the basis of infant–caregiver attachment 
formation. The infant’s need for proximal contact with a caregiver has been estab-
lished in mainstream psychology as a mechanism that facilitated access to caregiv-
ers that altricial infants depended on for survival. In the process of having that need 
met by a caregiver over the course of 3 years, a bond of attachment was formed with 
that caregiver (Bowlby, 1969/84). Advancing on that premise, we contend that in 
7  Attachment and Caregiving in the Mother–Infant Dyad: Evolutionary…

152
most cases that caregiver would have been the infant’s mother since infants’ 3-year-­
long need for close contact with a caregiver coincided with the period during which 
they required breast milk, and the most likely source of breast milk was an infant’s 
mother. Since propinquity is an inherent feature of breastfeeding, steady and endur-
ing experiences of close contact were inevitable features of infant–maternal dyads 
that would have been responsible for attachment bonds arising as a species-wide 
feature of humans.
In contemporary Western settings, nutritionally adequate substitutes for breast 
milk are widely available, and so it is no longer the case that infants’ needs for 
breast milk overlap with those for proximal contact with a caregiver. Hence, mater-
nal caregiving of infants is not synonymous with breastfeeding, and breastfeeding is 
not a defining feature of present-day Western mothers of infants. Even so, it is a 
manner of parenting that is known to have been practiced in the EEA that is still in 
practice today. Moreover, it features psychophysiological underpinnings in both 
mothers and infants, and these are largely unchanged. These underpinnings high-
light features of lactation that were adaptive in the EEA and they appear to continue 
to exert influence in contemporary settings. Yet, the nature of such influence and the 
possibility of its continued protectiveness are poorly understood. Therefore, lacta-
tion is a relevant and researchable topic of investigative attention that deserves 
increased attention for its potential to shed light on mothers, infants, and the infant–
maternal relationship.
Thus, we conclude by calling for investigative attention to the constructs of 
lactation-­based caregiving and cohesion. Insight into lactation-based caregiving is 
likely to emerge through attention to constituents of breast milk that help infants set 
the biological dialog (Raju, 2011) in motion and help sustain their functionality as 
proximate influences on maternal caregiving over the course of infancy. We also call 
for efforts to unpack the basis of the breastfeeding mother’s responsivity to those 
cues. Such efforts hold potential to yield fresh insight into maternal caregiving of 
infants as it originated—under conditions where it was supported, not only by exog-
enous influences that mothers derived from alloparental caregivers (Hrdy & 
Burkhart, Chap. 8, this volume; Henry & Morelli, Chap. 10, this volume), but also 
from endogenously organized influences that mothers derived from various biobe-
havioral and ecological features of lactation.
Finally, productive efforts to address lactation-based cohesion will require open-
ness to the relevance of questions that pertain to the breastfeeding relationship 
which is a topic that has been marginalized since the publication of Harlow’s (1958) 
work, The Nature of Love. Yet, as rates of breastfeeding rise, and familiarity with it 
grows, the breastfeeding relationship is increasingly being recognized for entailing 
“particular unity” (Leckman et al., 2006, p. 120). The basis of such “unity” can be 
approached through attention to biobehavioral synchrony in the nursling–mother 
dyad, particularly features that support it in mothers and those that are responsible 
for the way in which it is experienced by infants. For infants, these physical and 
psychological experiences derive from sensations of satiety, sweetness, and physi-
cal well-being that come from consuming breast milk, as well as ecological features 
that have been found to engender feelings of intimacy, exclusivity, safety, and

comfort. Fruitful treatments would address continuity and change in these experi-
ences over the course of prolonged breastfeeding. Ideally, longitudinal approaches 
would illuminate ancestral infants’ trajectory along a pathway from lactation-based 
cohesion to bonds of attachment able to withstand being untethered to lactation by 
the time the life stage of infancy came to conclusion.

How Reliance on Allomaternal Care 
Shapes Primate Development with Special 
Reference to the Genus Homo
Sarah Blaffer Hrdy and Judith M. Burkart 
8.1  Setting the Plio-Pleistocene Stage
Apes with the life history attributes of Homo sapiens could not have evolved unless 
male and female allomothers had helped mothers care for and provision their 
exceedingly costly, slow-maturing offspring born after relatively short inter-birth 
intervals. We refer to this as the Cooperative Breeding Hypothesis (Hrdy, 2009, 
2016a). Across the animal world, breeding systems characterized by female or male 
group members other than parents (alloparents) helping parents to care for and pro-
vision offspring have evolved many times in social insects, in 9% of 10,000 species 
of birds (Cockburn, 2006), and in perhaps 3% of 4500 species of mammals. The 
prevalence of allomaternal care tends to be higher among social carnivores (Clutton-­
Brock, 2016). The prevalence of shared care is higher still among primates where 
females or males other than the mother care for and at least minimally provision 
offspring in more than 30% of species in the Order Primates (Isler & van Schaik, 
2012a; Perry, 2020). However, the only primates with extensive alloparental provi-
sioning involving group members definitely known not to be the genetic parents as 
well as parents, occur among humans and in a distantly related subfamily of New 
World monkeys, the Callitrichidae, containing marmosets and tamarins.
An earlier version of this essay titled “The Emergence of Emotionally Modern Humans: 
Implications for Language and Learning” was published in a special issue of the Philosophical 
Transactions of the Royal Society, edited by Alison Gopnik, Michael Tomasello, and Willem 
Frankenhuis. That essay is expanded and updated here with permission.

Various circumstances conducive to the evolution of cooperative breeding per-
tained among hominins in Plio-Pleistocene Africa (Meindl et  al., 2018). These 
included cohesive social groups containing close relatives; production of increas-
ingly costly, slower maturing young; increasing reliance on hunting and extractive 
foraging such that immatures began to depend on adults to acquire or process food 
for them and to facilitate their learning appropriate skills (Clutton-Brock, 2016; 
Emlen, 1991; Hawkes, 2020; Hrdy, 2009; Jaeggi & van Schaik, 2011; Langen, 
2000; O’Connell et al., 2002), and importantly, ecological instability (Burkart et al., 
2017; Jetz & Rubenstein, 2011).
Unpredictable rainfall against a background of increasing aridity rendered the 
emergence of shared provisioning more and more critical for the survival of depen-
dent hominin offspring (Anton et al., 2014; Magill et al., 2013; Morgan et al., 2020; 
O’Connell et al., 2002; Richerson & Boyd, 2020). In spite of recurring periods of 
food shortage accompanied by high child mortality, hominin mothers in the line of 
bipedal apes leading to Homo sapiens were producing slower maturing, increas-
ingly large-brained, energetically more costly offspring, yet also beginning to pro-
duce infants after shorter intervals. How? Along with others, we have hypothesized 
that by 2 million years ago with Homo erectus, hominin mothers increasingly relied 
on assistance from other group members to supplement offspring who even after 
weaning still remained years from nutritional independence (Burkart et al., 2009; 
Hawkes, 2020; Hawkes et  al., 1998; Hrdy, 1999; Konner, 2010; Meehan & 
Crittenden, 2016). (Fig. 8.1).
It’s not easy to date gradual, often subtle, life history changes from the fossil 
record. This unusual combination of prolonged nutritional dependence accompa-
nied by earlier weaning permitting mothers to resume cycling, conceive again, and 
reproduce faster, would almost certainly have required some type of allomaternal 
assistance. In our previous work, we have tentatively tied these life history changes 
to the early Pleistocence with the emergence of somewhat larger brained Homo 
erectus. However, some paleontologists hypothesize that slower development, and 
with it, longer dependence and allomaternal assistance, were already getting under-
way with Australopithecus by 3 million or so years ago (De Silva, 2011; Gunz et al., 
2020). A few researchers push allomaternal assistance (involving fathers) back even 
earlier to Ardipithecus (Raghanti et al., 2018).
Over time, stacking of closely spaced dependent offspring would further inten-
sify reliance on allomaternal provisioning. By the Pleistocene, we suspect that hom-
inins were adopting even more flexible residence patterns than those found in the 
other Great Apes (Koenig & Borries, 2012), with “multilocal” residence patterns 
beginning to resemble those typical of twentieth-century hunter-gatherers (Hill 
et al., 2011; Marlowe, 2010). Greater female autonomy of movement and the emer-
gence of pair-bonds (why they emerged being a topic still debated) would increase 
chances that probable fathers and matrilineal kin resided nearby (Behar et al., 2008).
Greater postpartum tolerance on the part of ordinarily possessive ape mothers 
coevolved with increasing, albeit still facultative, neurophysiological responsive-
ness on the part of fathers and other allomothers increasingly motivated to care for 
immatures (Abraham et al., 2014; Numan, 2014; Raghanti et al., 2018). The more

dependent upon allomaternal assistance primate mothers are, the more sensitive 
they become to cues of social support, especially postpartum (Hrdy, 1999, 2016b). 
Compared with the reflexive protectiveness and possessiveness typical of all but the 
most stressed or inexperienced Great Ape mothers, postpartum commitment of 
these hominins would likely have been more conditional. Across traditional societ-
ies, mothers are known to abandon at birth infants considered defective as well as 
adjust parental investment in line with social and ecological circumstances (Hrdy, 
1999, chapters 12 and 13; Konner, 1972; Scrimshaw, 1984; see Salmon & Hehman, 
Chap. 4, this volume).
Infants who could no longer count on being the sole priority of a single-mindedly 
dedicated mother had to elicit and maintain maternal commitment while also attract-
ing and ingratiating themselves with others. Rewarded when they succeeded, over 
the course of development, infants learned to express otherwise latent sociocogni-
tive potentials. As we use the term, “ingratiating behaviors” refer to anything an 
infant does to increase his or her chances of being chosen as the object of beneficent 
attention (including provisioning) where offspring best at ingratiating themselves 
with others would be most likely to survive. Over the course of development, these 
Fig. 8.1  We hypothesize that by two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus, 
mothers were already beginning to wean infants somewhat earlier than among other apes. Earlier 
weaning and shorter inter-birth intervals were only feasible because alloparents (group members 
other than genetic parents) as well as parents helped to care for and provision nutritionally depen-
dent, slow-maturing hominin young. (“The real Pleistocene family” as reconstructed by artist

youngsters learned to monitor and be interested in the intentions, thoughts, and feel-
ings of others, even internalizing their preferences. Over generations, youngsters 
best at doing so would be more likely to survive, resulting in populations of apes 
emotionally very different from their ancestors (Fig. 8.2).
In this contribution, we reconstruct how growing up in such a social environment 
may have impacted dependent immatures along with the cascading consequences 
this would have had on uniquely human forms of learning and language. We start by 
asking: How would dependent immatures respond to the challenges of eliciting 
vital, but facultatively proffered, maternal and allomaternal attentions? What would 
this little ape need to do? Because none of us can go back in time to observe how 
early hominin infants would have behaved, we draw on evidence for how nonhuman 
ape and modern human babies responded in “virtual” experiments with and without 
allomaternal care to test assumptions made here about how hominin infants would 
have behaved with allomaternal care (Hrdy, 2016a), as well as on evidence from 
Fig. 8.2  This thought experiment traces dual ontogenetic and evolutionary processes set in motion 
when mothers in the line leading to the genus Homo began to rely on alloparental care and provi-
sioning to rear increasingly costly, sometimes more closely spaced, offspring. Intermittent behav-
ioral conditioning would encourage youngsters to repeat and refine facial expressions, attitudes, 
and vocalizations most likely to appeal to potential caretakers. This would lead to the expression 
of otherwise latent potentials and the formation of novel neural networks. Over generations, these 
quite novel ape phenotypes would be exposed to directional social selection favoring youngsters 
best at ingratiating themselves with others, setting in motion a causal chain of adaptive evolution 
that began with development (West-Eberhard, 2003)

other primate infants reared in contexts where they had to rely on allomaternal care 
and provisioning. Although inevitably speculative, this reconstruction is informed 
by both comparative evidence and a growing understanding of the survival chal-
lenges hominin infants must have confronted.
8.2  Growing Up as a Cooperative Breeder – 
Callitrichid-Hominin Parallels
As our point of departure, we begin with callitrichid monkeys (comprising marmo-
sets and tamarins), the only extant primates besides humans with extensive allopa-
rental in addition to parental care and provisioning of infants. Even though not all 
elements of human cooperative childcare are also present in callitrichids, they nev-
ertheless face many similar challenges and thus share some critical proximate 
mechanisms of helping, including hormonal regulators and psychological predispo-
sitions (Burkart et al., 2017).
Callitrichids face similar challenges to those hominin infants would have faced, 
although they do so endowed with far smaller brains. Callitrichid mothers custom-
arily give birth to twins, and due to post-partum oestrus are immediately pregnant 
again (Erb & Porter, 2017; Garber, 1997). They are thus lactating and gestating at 
the same time, and the new set of offspring is born before the previous one is fully 
independent. This costly reproduction is only possible because other group mem-
bers help by carrying infants, protecting them, and substantially provisioning them 
(Guerreiro Martins et  al., 2019). Like human mothers, callitrichid mothers are 
highly tolerant toward other group members interested in carrying their babies, and 
they adjust their maternal investment relative to how much help is available (Bardi 
et al., 2001; Fite et al., 2005; Hrdy, 1999). Helpers provisioning immatures exhibit 
highly prosocial motivations (Brügger et al., 2018; Guerreiro Martins et al., 2019). 
Callitrichid twins are thus confronted with challenges similar to youngsters born to 
hominin mothers who, when conditions permitted, similarly produced more closely 
spaced young (in “as-if” litters).
A system reliant on allomaternal care is only feasible if mothers are willing to 
allow access to their infants and if other group members are interested in caring for 
offspring that are not their own (Burkart et al., 2009; Burkart et al., 2018b). Among 
cooperatively breeding primates such as callitrichids, caretaking includes carrying, 
feeding, and protecting the infants. Infant carrying requires not only high tolerance 
by mothers but also among all other group members because vulnerable neonates 
are handed over from one caregiver to the next in coordinated joint actions. Since 
only mothers lactate, others feed immatures by sharing and actually proffering pal-
atable foods, unusual behaviors among primates. Since immatures are not always 
close to adults who find food, adults even offer it proactively with food-offering 
calls. This requires a high level of donative intent. Finally, group members have to 
8  How Reliance on Allomaternal Care Shapes Primate Development with Special…

166
coordinate and take turns in activities such as infant transport, vigilance, and 
protection.
To fulfill these tasks, high levels of social tolerance among adults during every-
day life are mandatory. Moreover, a predisposition to not only care about one’s own 
well-being but also about that of others and to be willing to help them is essential 
for proactive provisioning and the coordination of cooperative activities (Fig. 8.3).
So, is it the case that primate species exhibiting extensive levels of shared care 
tend to be more cooperative and prosocial than other species? Group Service experi-
ments estimating cooperation in 24 groups belonging to 15 different primate spe-
cies, including humans, suggests that both social tolerance and proactive prosociality 
are indeed correlated with the amount of allomaternal care (Burkart et al., 2014, 
Fig. 8.4).
The coordination of these cooperative activities, and figuring out who is willing 
to take over an infant to carry it, is smoother if individuals are constantly monitoring 
the whereabouts, activities, and intentions of their group members. This attentional 
predisposition toward monitoring others in a relaxed way is evident in the lack of 
gaze aversion in callitrichid monkeys and has recently been documented with gaze-­
tracking studies comparing active vision in the cooperatively breeding marmoset 
and the independently breeding macaque monkeys. The marmosets had longer 
inspection times for faces, and looked at them directly more frequently compared to 
the macaques (Nummela et al., 2019). Together, these predispositions per se can 
already facilitate performance in sociocognitive tasks such as social learning or

pulls the food reward to within reach of its group members, without being able to get anything for

cooperative problem-solving (Burkart & van Schaik, 2010), and impact the devel-
opment of youngsters born into such groups.
In addition, however, immatures face an additional set of specific challenges in 
such a social environment, and those best at mastering them have increased fitness. 
Most importantly, immatures have to appeal to and solicit succor from allomothers 
as well as mothers. Human infants and infants in the distantly related callitrichids 
appear to have converged on some similar modes of doing so. So how might such 
solutions be extended and transformed if dependent immatures were endowed with 
much more powerful ape cognitive systems to begin with? And what might have 
been the cascading consequences for uniquely human forms of learning and lan-
guage? It is time to look at little apes reared under the novel circumstances pertain-
ing among Pleistocene hominins.
8.3  The Hominin Infant’s to-Do List
8.3.1  First Order of Business: Appeal to Mother
Although born with open eyes, able to blurrily seek the eyes of someone else, all 
newborn apes are otherwise altricial, utterly dependent on others for warmth, pro-
tection, locomotion, and food (Bard, 2012; Tomonaga et al., 2004). Fortunately, 
apes enjoy the built-in mammalian advantage of being born to a mother who during 
gestation was suffused by hormones lowering her threshold for responding to 
sounds and smells of a warm, wriggling, fluid-covered baby. If only the newborn 
can make it to maternal nipples, root, suck, and stimulate lactation, ensuing surges 
in oxytocin and prolactin, further enhancing her nurturing impulses. With lactation 
underway, even an inexperienced first-time ape mother becomes increasingly 
bonded to this newcomer. But over the course of hominin evolution, increasing 
Fig. 8.4  Results from group service experiments described in Burkart et al. (2014). The amount 
of allomaternal care directly predicts proactive prosociality (left-hand side; % of food items made 
available to group members) and social tolerance (right-hand side; 1 = high, 0 = low) across pri-
mate species, including humans. Great apes are highlighted in bold, cooperatively breeding pri-
mates are underlined

168
maternal reliance on allomaternal assistance would have rendered mothers increas-
ingly sensitive to cues of available social support. In the absence of social support, 
the commitment of even the most experienced human mother falters (see especially 
Bugos & McCarthy, 1984; Hrdy, 1999, 2016b).
Over evolutionary time, more contingent commitment preadapted human moth-
ers to become more discriminating than other apes. In addition to their parity, prior 
experience, physical condition, and likely social support, mothers began to respond 
to specific physical attributes of each infant. Consciously or not, each costly infant 
was in competition not only with still nutritionally dependent older siblings but also 
with subsequent infants a mother might bear under ecologically more opportune 
conditions if only she retrenched upon investment in this one, or bailed out alto-
gether, and resumed cycling sooner. Over the course of the Pleistocene (perhaps 
earlier?), hominin babies came under increasing pressure to look good and sound 
vigorous right at birth, advertising that they were full-term, robust, good bets for 
survival, worth further investment. This challenge may help explain why, over the 
course of hominin evolution, fetuses began to stockpile adipose tissue at an unlikely 
time, just prior to squeezing through increasingly narrow birth canals. By now, 
human neonates are born much fatter than other apes (ca.10–14% body fat con-
trasted with 3–4% for chimpanzees). No doubt, an extra dollop of energy was ini-
tially beneficial for thermoregulation and fueling fast-growing brains, contributing 
to the emergence in mothers of sensory biases favoring plump babies (Kuzawa 
et al., 2014). Over time, plumpness may also have come to serve as an infantile 
equivalent of sex appeal seducing mothers into embarking on a long, exorbitantly 
costly, endeavor (Hrdy, 1999, chapter 21).
Once increasingly discriminating hominin mothers began to notice associations 
between birth weight and later outcomes, one of evolution’s more consequential 
self-reinforcing feedback loops would be underway. With runaway social selection 
(sensu West-Eberhard) for neonatal plumpness underway, extra energy stores 
became available for brain development, in turn rendering allomaternal provision-
ing even more essential. Over generations, allomothers as well became attuned to 
cues of neonatal viability, adjusting levels of commitment accordingly (Hrdy, 2016b).
This brings us to the hominin infant’s second order of business.
8.3.2  Attract Others
Because hominin mothers as well benefitted from allomaternal assistance, it 
behoved females to reside near trusted others, matrilineal kin and/or adult males 
who were probable fathers. Unlike exceedingly possessive Great Ape mothers, 
mothers in traditional human societies not only tolerate but often encourage post-
partum contact with infants. Whether this shift was due to innately more tolerant 
temperaments, to greater autonomy in selecting who to live among, or both, is not 
clear. In any event, maternal tolerance facilitated intimate exposure of trusted group 
members 
to

affiliation-promoting neurophysiological transformations in male and female allo-
mothers alike (Abraham et al., 2017; Bales et al., 2004; Carter & Perkeybile, 2018; 
Hrdy, 2009). Among humans, only a few hours of intimate contact with grandpar-
ents can be sufficient to produce surges in oxytocin and reorder priorities (Hrdy, 
2019). (Among marmosets, similar oxytocin increases are found not only in moth-
ers, but in all group members after the birth of new babies; Finkenwirth et al., 2016.)
But other factors also enter in, including the allomother’s own physical condition 
and past caretaking experiences, alternatives available, as well as the infant’s vul-
nerability and level of need. Facing this uncertainty, cues from infants themselves to 
elicit allomaternal involvement would again be paramount. Over time, human allo-
mothers become sensitive to the same viability cues that mothers respond to. 
Magnetic resonance images of modern human brains reveal that even nulliparous 
women find the faces of plump, healthy-looking (read full-term) babies “cuter” and 
more rewarding to look at (Glocker et al., 2009). Not only physical viability cues 
but also behavioral interactions will attract caregivers. Humans are born with neu-
rological capacities comparable to those of other apes, but differences soon emerge 
(Lonsdorf et al., 2010). At birth, both chimpanzee and human newborns seek out 
eyes, are capable of mutual gazing, and caught just right, may imitate someone 
else’s outstretched tongue or other facial expressions (Myowa-Yamakoshi, 2010). 
Both species exhibit reflexive “fairy smiles,” soon to be replaced by more open-eyed 
“social smiles” in response to someone else. Among newborn chimpanzees, that 
someone else would always be their own mother (Matsuzawa, 2010). In traditional 
human societies, however, blearily gazing newborns engage a wider audience 
(Konner, 1972, 2010). Over time as infants grow accustomed to and learn to trust 
specific allomothers, the sorts of emotional bonds primate infants forge with moth-
ers prove sufficiently elastic to encompass multiple attachment figures, an average 
of six attachment figures among the Central African Aka hunter-gatherers Courtney 
Meehan studied (Meehan & Hawks, 2013). It is not known whether human infants 
are more prone to forge multiple attachments than are other apes if cared for by both 
mothers and others because nonhuman apes virtually never are.
A challenge unique to immatures of cooperatively breeding primates is that they 
are not in continuous contact with their caregiver. This can be buffered by proactive 
caregiving motivations by adults as in callitrichids where group members monitor 
babies on carriers eager to take over when necessary (Yamamoto & Box, 1997), or 
proactively announce that they have found food and are ready to share it. Such pro-
visioning is different from food sharing patterns in other primates, where at most, 
immatures are passively tolerated when taking their mother’s food (Brown et al., 
2004; Jaeggi et al., 2010). Nevertheless, without being in constant body contact 
with a single caregiver, cooperatively breeding immatures face the chronic risk of 
being overlooked.
Among apes such as chimpanzees, gorillas, or orangutans, newborns constantly 
held by mothers in direct skin-to-skin contact have less need to smile or vocalize. 
Calling would only be useful if separated, or later, at weaning, as youngsters object 
to maternal rejections. Otherwise, low, scarcely audible sounds make more sense 
than loudly advertising to predators, “vulnerable baby here!” Among primates with 
8  How Reliance on Allomaternal Care Shapes Primate Development with Special…

170
shared care, life tends to be noisier. Infants need to stay “in touch without touch” 
and may complain to prompt maternal retrievals. Infant langur monkeys spend up to 
50% of their first day of life being held and carried by females-other-than-mothers, 
calling incessantly (Hrdy, 1977).
Life is even noisier in animals with biparental and alloparental provisioning 
where babies beg for treats. This correlation is best documented in birds (Leighton, 
2017), but it also holds for callitrichids and humans who fall among the most volu-
ble of primates (Burkart et al., 2018b). Vocalizing starts early in marmosets and 
tamarins, becoming more frequent and specialized over the course of development. 
Begging calls spike around weaning when allomaternal provisioning is most critical 
(Brown et al., 2004; Rapaport & Brown, 2008). But these infants not only are noisy 
beggars but also engage in babbling-like behaviors, by producing repetitive, random-­
sounding streams of elements of adult vocalizations that can last for more than a 
minute. This babbling-like behavior comes with likely cost because it is noisy and 
makes infants conspicuous to predators. It peaks around weaning when allomater-
nal provisioning is most critical and turns out to be an effective attention getter, as 
adults are more likely to approach and interact with immatures that are babbling 
(Elowson et al., 1998).
Something similar goes on in humans. The onset of babbling roughly coincides 
with the time hunter-gatherer allomothers begin providing edible treats (discussed 
below). Within weeks of birth, human infants emit engaging noises. Learning pro-
gresses more rapidly if infants notice others reacting. By 10 weeks, some actually 
take turns vocalizing. The sound of a baby laughing generates an especially power-
ful stimulus, audible at some distance and signaling emotional engagement (Parsons 
et al., 2013; Riem Madelon et al., 2017). As babies put two and two together, con-
ditioning plus early glimmerings of intersubjectivity (Trevarthen & Aitken, 2001) 
encourage them to incorporate sensory biases and preferences of potential caretak-
ers into their own expanding repertoires for ingratiating themselves with others 
(Gopnik, 2020). By 9  months, little humans go out of their way to be helpful 
(Warneken & Tomasello, 2006). By 19 months, infants readily share, even offer 
delectable food items to someone else (Barragan et al., 2020). These human young-
sters also care about what others think of their performance (Engelmann et  al., 
2012; Reddy, 2003).
8.3.3  Vocal Control and More Flexible Vocalizing
Old World monkeys and apes are sophisticated communicators. Vervet monkeys, 
for example, emit one kind of call to alert group mates of raptors, a different alarm 
call for terrestrial enemies. They are also sensitive to context, taking into account 
who is listening and who is out of range, modifying calls accordingly (Cheney & 
Seyfarth, 1990). Apes, particularly chimpanzees and bonobos, also make extensive 
use of hands and arms to communicate what they want, extending an arm palm up 
when requesting something. Even so, their vocal repertoires never achieve the

171
richness, sophistication, and flexibility of their gesturing (Pollick & de Waal, 2007). 
Rather, nonhuman apes seem surprisingly limited in the kinds of vocalizations they 
emit (Slocombe & Zuberbühler, 2010), a marked contrast with humans who early in 
development increase vocal control and start to build larger and more flexible vocal 
repertoires (Zuberbühler, 2011). So how did this get started?
One important element developed elsewhere concerns the challenges that adults, 
rather than the immatures of cooperative breeders, are confronted with (Burkart 
et al., 2018b; Snowdon, 2001). They must increasingly coordinate their activities 
with others, as when transferring infants back and forth. Their prosociality moti-
vates them to not only share food with others, but also provides information useful 
to them. Vocal communication is a prime candidate to provide solutions to such 
challenges. In line with this proposal, the large vocal repertoires of cooperatively 
breeding birds are driven by an increase in contact and alarm calls (Leighton, 2017). 
A critical element is added by immatures who grow up in an increasingly voluble 
environment.
From a comparative perspective, it seems clear that shared care with babies car-
ried by others increases vocalization frequency. Allomaternal provisioning and con-
tingent reinforcement raise the stakes, with begging leading to more calling, 
especially if immatures have to compete for rewarding attentions (Goldstein et al., 
2003; Leighton, 2017). Through the expression of otherwise latent capacities and 
their subsequent shaping, attention-getting and begging set the stage for selection to 
favor enhanced vocal control accompanied by goal-oriented shaping of acoustic 
structure. Indeed, as in marmosets, vocal development in humans occurs earlier than 
motor development (Gustison et al., 2019). By contrast, infants in constant close 
contact with single-mindedly dedicated mothers (as in independently breeding spe-
cies such as chimpanzees) would more often be called upon to cling than cry.
Experiments with marmosets undertaken by Asif Ghazanfar and his team dem-
onstrate how contingent responsiveness by caretakers generates turn-taking and also 
speeds development of specialized, more mature-sounding calls (Takahashi et al., 
2016). For 40 minutes a day during the first 2 months of life, each of a pair of mar-
moset twins was separated from their parents and allowed to call. Whereas one twin 
was provided consistent feedback from taped parental calls, the other twin received 
less consistent feedback. The more reliable the feedback, the more rapidly infants 
progressed from the coarse, random-sounding vocalizations typical of immatures to 
cleaner, more tonal, adult-like phee calls (Takahashi et al., 2016; Takahashi et al., 
2017). By 2–3 months of age, their utterances resembled the turn-taking “conversa-
tions” human babies engage in with their caretakers. Chow et al. (2015) further 
showed that parents actively intervene when immatures make typical mistakes 
while learning to engage in turn-taking. If immatures get timing wrong and “inter-
rupt” their parents, parents add an extra break before responding. When immatures 
respond with a wrong call type, the parents themselves interrupt them with the cor-
rect phee call. In another example of convergent evolution between human coopera-
tive breeders and these tiny-brained, distantly related New World monkeys, 
Takahashi et al. (2017) noted that infant marmosets responding to contingent rein-
forcement rely on one of the same circuits to guide their phee calls that humans use

in speech. The patterning of FoxP2 expression in marmosets’ cortico-striatal circuit 
turns out to be analogous to that in both humans and songbirds. Moreover, a role of 
oxytocin has recently been proposed for the social motivation and evolution of 
vocal learning and language (Theofanopoulou et al., 2017), which is consistent with 
the increase of oxytocin in all group members after the birth of marmoset immatures 
(Finkenwirth et  al., 2016) and its link with prosociality among group members 
(Finkenwirth & Burkart, 2017).
Observations of golden lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia) in Brazil illustrate 
how these increasingly complex, two-way conversations function in natural habitats 
(Rapaport, 2011). Solitary adults traverse the treetops hunting for spiders, insects, 
and small frogs, prying prey from inside holes or tangled foliage. Youngsters learn 
to locate, stalk, and dexterously extract and dispatch struggling, sometimes biting or 
stinging, prey. Learning takes time and practice as immatures grow more adept at 
responding to adults volunteering prey. Deliveries peak near the end of weaning 
when up to 90% of their diets are provided by (mostly male) allomothers (Rapaport, 
2011). Food transfers are often initiated by youngsters begging. But when adults 
locate food, provisioners too emit staccato “food-offering calls.” Mothers, probable 
fathers, and other helpers extract the food and call the infant to come and get the 
food out of their hands. As prey-catching efficiency improves, but before youngsters 
reach adult proficiency, mentors switch from “come and get it” calls to “hey, look 
here!” calls. Adult calls direct older immatures’ attention to a particular patch of 
substrate where prey have been detected. The finder then waits nearby while the 
young locate and extract the prey for themselves. Such adjustment of adults to 
immature skill levels has also been found in other callitrichids in captive studies 
(cotton-top tamarins, Humle & Snowdon, 2008; common marmosets, Chow et al., 
2015; Dell’Mour et al., 2009). As infants increasingly associate an allomother’s 
particular call with a particular reward, they register regularities in how others 
respond to particular sounds they themselves make.
Opportunities to link own vocal productions to regularities in how others respond 
to them are particularly evident for babbling (humans) or babbling-like behaviors 
(callitrichids). In humans, babbling emerges spontaneously at around 5–7 months, 
about the same time as the emergence of milk teeth, which among hunter-gatherers 
often coincides with allomothers beginning to offer premasticated and other (some-
times “kiss-fed”) treats to infants (Hrdy, 2009). At some level (consciously or not), 
children recognize that babbling attracts rewarding attention. This may help explain 
why older children revert to “baby talk” after the birth of a younger sibling (S. Hrdy, 
personal observation 2019). Interestingly, babbling in marmosets not only attracts 
caregivers but also speeds up the acquisition of adult-like forms of vocalizations. 
Moreover, babbling similarly can resume and spike among juvenile marmosets fol-
lowing the birth of new infants in their group (Snowdon & Elowson, 2001). 
Apparently the same message is being conveyed: “pay attention to me!”
“If babbling changes adult behavior in predictable, infant-oriented ways,” as 
Goldstein and colleagues propose, “infants should be able to recognize changes in 
others’ actions as a result of their vocalizations” (Goldstein et al., 2003, p. 8034), 
launching more goal-oriented vocal control. As with other apes, humans are born

with limited motor control over articulation, but beginning around 6  months, 
humans gain increased vocal control, including more tongue involvement, with 
vocal tracts continuing to develop over the first 15 months, contributing to greater 
vocal flexibility and larger vocal repertoires in humans than other apes (Zuberbühler, 
2011). Impressed by the coincidence in timing between increased vocal control and 
the transition from baby-calls to babbling-like streams of consonants and vowels, 
Klaus Zuberbühler makes a compelling case that increased control derived from 
hominin infants’ need to attract allomaternal attentions (Zuberbühler, 2011, pp. 71, 
77–79). Although “babbling” is widely assumed to have first emerged in human 
children in preparation for the acquisition of spoken language – akin to Mother 
Nature adding training wheels on a bicycle – it makes more sense (and is far less 
teleological) to consider the initial emergence of traits like babbling as byproducts 
of infantile needs to attract caregivers. A key innovation here was increased motor 
control over articulation. Once vocalizations become subject to voluntary control, 
they can be shaped via conditional reinforcement, critical preadaptations for the 
eventual evolution of spoken language.
8.3.4  Incorporate Others’ Preferences
These novel capacities emerged within broader sociocognitive contexts where apes 
were already endowed with rudimentary Theory of Mind (Herrmann et al., 2007; 
Krupenye et al., 2016; Tomasello, 2019), already utilizing rich gestural repertoires 
(Pollick & de Waal, 2007), already employing tools and devising new modes of 
extracting food. At a social level, we suspect new modes of interpreting the prefer-
ences of others were also emerging, including new modes of emotional and perspec-
tive taking. This could help explain why even though locomotor abilities develop 
faster in chimpanzees and other extant apes, little humans are the precocious ones 
in terms of sociocognition and interactive communication. For example, even 
though chimpanzee infants are gamboling with others and playing much earlier than 
human children, human babies start to laugh much earlier, by 4 months of age com-
pared to 12 months among wild chimpanzees. More complex social interactions, 
such as offering comfort, with one individual consoling another with a hug, are seen 
as early as 13  months in human toddlers, not before 2.4  years in chimpanzees 
(Bründl et al., 2020). In other words, human infants not only test better than other 
apes in sociocognitive realms (Herrmann et al., 2007), they develop these prosocial 
and subjectively interactive capacities early (Wobber et al., 2014), long before they 
could be any practical use in cooperative foraging or group defense (see Buttelmann, 
Chap. 13, this volume).
These are early days in the comparative study of anthropoid brain development, 
but in this context, it is worth noting the unusually early development in human 
infants of brain areas implicated by inter-personal assessments and decision-making 
related to social interactions. Initial results from magnetic resonance imagining of 
developing chimpanzee and human brains suggest that when controlled for absolute

size, white matter in the frontal cortex develops more rapidly in humans than in 
chimpanzees (Sakai et al., 2010, and especially Sakai et al., 2011). By the second 
half of the first year of life, this rapid trajectory of growth in parts of the brain linked 
to discriminating between or assessing others is already underway, continuing to 
expand to age three (see Wilder & Semendeferi, Chap. 8, this volume). Such precoc-
ity contrasts with slower maturation in other neural systems such as those control-
ling locomotion and physical coordination which proceed faster in infant 
chimpanzees who literally can run circles around their human counterparts. This 
raises the possibility that even though human infants are notably helpless at birth 
and through the first months of life, their altriciality is selective. Human infants 
develop at a slower pace than other primates in physical and locomotive domains, 
but their capacities for assessing motivations and preferences of others and for inter-­
subjective communication, mature faster (Hrdy, 2014).
By the Late Pleistocene, selection pressures from a range of new subsistence and 
socioecological challenges would have favored ever greater inter-individual coordi-
nation among adults (Boehm, 2012; Tomasello, 2018; Tomasello et al., 1993). But 
we propose that more other-regarding impulses provided the underpinnings for 
coordinated behaviors such as group hunting and were already present, having 
begun to emerge during childhood earlier in the Pleistocene. It is within this broader 
context that recent proposals linking cooperative breeding not only to the evolution 
of enhanced capacities for joint attention (Ben Mocha et al., 2019), but also for 
language, need to be understood (Burkart et  al., 2018b; Knight, 2016; 
Zuberbühler, 2011).
Social selection favoring more flexible communication coincided with other co-­
evolving feedback loops. But by themselves, neither larger brains nor increased 
uses for cooperation are sufficient to explain the evolution of language. As psychia-
trist Peter Hobson reminds us, “before language there (had to be) something else … 
that could evolve in tiny steps … that something else was social engagement with 
each other. The links that can join one person’s mind with the mind of someone else 
are, especially to begin with, emotional links” (Hobson, 2004, p. 2, emphasis in 
original). But what about the foundational steps? Klaus Zuberbühler’s speculations 
point us in a promising direction: “Once vocal control has evolved to help infants 
secure care, it is only a small step to producing utterances in context-specific ways” 
(Zuberbühler, 2011, p. 80). But, Zuberbühler adds, such a transformation “may only 
be possible against a background of other psychological skills, such as the ability to 
share intentions and attention (Tomasello, 2008), and well-developed comprehen-
sion” (Zuberbühler, 2011, p. 80). He expands on Tomasello’s insight regarding a 
“major difference” (Tomasello, 1999) between humans and other primates, involv-
ing (as Tomasello would later phrase it) capacities for “intersubjective sharing” 
(Tomasello & Carpenter, 2007, pp. 121–22).
Eagerness to ingratiate themselves with others would be enhanced by allomater-
nal care, an interpretation consistent with observations of captive chimpanzees who 
when co-reared by responsive human caretakers (allomothers of a different species) 
as well as their mothers, become more eager than wild chimpanzees are to engage 
in targeted helping of others (Bard, 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2012; reviewed in Hrdy, 
S. B. Hrdy and J. M. Burkart

175
2016a). Even though human-tended chimpanzees do not acquire spoken language 
and other distinctively human traits, they nevertheless develop greater concern for 
the intentions and goals of others, learning the power that particular gestures, facial 
expressions, and utterances exert on others. For example, human-reared chimpan-
zees point to what they want in ways that wild apes almost never do (Tomasello, 
2019). The expression of such interactive potentials in ape phenotypes would 
increase opportunities to share and increase effectiveness of helping. Over the 
course of human evolution, such opportunities may have increased selection favor-
ing neuroendocrine systems conducive to prosocial responses including the increas-
ingly “dopamine dominated” striatal systems being documented by paleontologists 
working in concert with neuroscientists (Raghanti et al., 2018). Interactions with 
processes that opened parental neural care systems to a wider range of social stimuli 
might have resulted in more unsolicited food sharing and general prosociality 
(Numan, 2014). Apes who needed to be more interested in the preferences of others 
would also find it more emotionally rewarding to do so. This chain of admittedly 
speculative reasoning brings us to a key component to the hominin infant’s to-do list.
8.3.5  Add Psychological Dimensions to Kindchenschema
Like all anthropoid primates, apes in the line leading to the genus Homo would 
grow up keenly aware of kin ties, alliances, statuses, and friendships. They would 
also be alert to competencies and reliability of group mates (Cheney & Seyfarth, 
2007; Perry, 2020). The quantitative skills and manipulative capabilities of a chim-
panzee or orangutan fall in the same ballpark as those of two-and-a-half-year-old 
humans. They too exhibit rudimentary capacities for theorizing about what others 
know (Herrmann et al., 2007; Krupenye et al., 2016; Tomasello, 2020). Our Last 
Common Ancestors with these apes were already beginning to register what others 
intended or wanted.
So, imagine such an ape growing up reliant on the competencies and motivations 
of others. If contingent reinforcement from allomothers encourages turn-taking and 
speeds up acquisition of adult vocalizations in tiny-brained marmosets with only 
minimal awareness of what another marmoset knows (Burkart & Heschl, 2007; 
Burkart et al., 2018b), how much more sensitive to the thoughts and preferences of 
others would apes already attuned to the thoughts and intentions of others become? 
Contingent allomaternal responses generate new psychological dimensions to 
Kindchenschema as apes growing up this way are conditioned to become more 
aware that others have preferences worth appealing to.
Youngsters would be conditioned to not only monitor the intentions of others but 
increasingly to probe their thoughts and feelings so as to better conform to their 
preferences. Over time, learning which facial expressions, sounds, or conversational 
rhythms result in solicitude would mature into more sophisticated understanding of 
how others perceived their own intentions, behaviors, and thoughts and to begin to 
care about their “reputations.”

8.4  New Dimensions to Social Learning
8.4.1  Expanded Avenues
All apes are endowed with inordinate behavioral flexibility along with aptitudes for 
manipulating objects and imitating others. In the case of chimpanzees and orang-
utans, knowledge about what to eat, where to find, and how to process it is transmit-
ted vertically during 5–8  years of intimate association with one other trusted 
individual, their mother. Mothers set the stage for socially induced independent 
practice (Jaeggi et al., 2010; Schuppli & van Schaik, 2018; Whiten, 1999) or, as in 
the case of chimpanzee nut-cracking, very occasionally make helpful adjustments 
(Boesch, 2012; Matsuzawa, 2010). The processes by which little apes copy and 
learn from others are, however, primarily self-initiated (Humle et  al., 2009). 
Provisioning and shared care broaden this initial context for social learning.
From an early age, youngsters with shared care observe a wider range of role 
models. For example, cooperatively breeding magpie jays with many helpers 
become more adept at harvesting arthropods than jays growing up with few helpers 
(Langen & Vehrencamp, 1998). Furthermore, demonstrators among cooperative 
breeders tend to be more prosocial, even deliberately helpful (Burkart et al., 2009; 
Burkart & van Schaik, 2010). Recall that golden lion tamarin allomothers (often 
probable or possible progenitors) provide the majority of food for nearly weaned 
infants. Adults call when they have food to offer, but with older immatures, they call 
them to places where prey is hidden and then immatures have to extract it for them-
selves. As performance levels plateau, food calls cease. Rapaport (2011, p. 746) 
compares this progressive, developmentally sensitive behavior coupled with vocal-
izations that track the needs and skills of youngsters to “teaching-like” behavior on 
the part of allomothers providing foraging assistance to youngsters (cf. Thornton & 
McAuliffe, 2006 for cooperatively breeding meerkats).
Incorporating situation-dependent vocalizations enhances effectiveness of these 
demonstrations while contingently delivered edible rewards rivets the attention of 
mentees. Anyone who has ever tried to habituate wild creatures, or even skittish 
domestic ones, knows that food rewards provide the quickest shortcut to taming or 
training them. Now add to this prosocial-provisioning-vocalizing mix mentalizing 
mentees eager to accommodate their mentors. Possibilities for information transfer 
expand exponentially.
8.4.2  Emotionally Modern and Mentalizing Mentees
Even in the absence of detectable Theory of Mind, tiny-brained marmosets prove 
remarkably prosocial, sharing food or rushing to assist others. Marmosets coordi-
nate with others to crack open tough fruits. They take babies from mothers, then 
voluntarily return them for nursing (Burkart et  al., 2009, 2014; Garber, 1997). 
S. B. Hrdy and J. M. Burkart

177
Tamarins even use guided demonstrations accentuated by vocalizations to transmit 
age-appropriate information (Rapaport, 2011). In this respect, tiny-brained callitri-
chids converge on something close to what ethnographers studying hunter-gatherers 
term “natural pedagogy” (Hewlett et al., 2011). Yet, even as tamarins adjust demon-
strations to the skill level of pupils, they do so without mentalizing what another 
knows. Marmosets who readily follow the gaze of another individual do so without 
registering what that individual is seeing (Burkart & Heschl, 2007).
So, what would happen if instead of the reflexive responsiveness of marmosets, 
the primates undertaking shared care and provisioning of young were already larger-­
bodied, bipedal, tool-users possessed of rudimentary Theory of Mind, with brains in 
the process of doubling from the 400 cc of chimpanzees or australopiths to the more 
expansive brains typical of Homo erectus? And what if novel contexts for social 
development coincided with new foraging tactics, more valuable food packets, and 
with these, a raised “grey ceiling” so that over time whenever – and for whatever 
reasons  – they became favored, even costlier brains could evolve (Isler & van 
Schaik, 2012a, 2012b)? Little hominins growing up as cooperative breeders would 
have opportunities to observe group members of different ages and sexes (Deffner 
& McElreath, 2020; Gurven et al., 2020; Hawkes, 2020), trust them as their mothers 
do, gauge their competencies and intentions, decide who was likely to be helpful or 
not – something modern humans begin to do from as early as 3 months old (Hamlin 
et al., 2007, 2010). And what if at the same time these infants were beginning to 
monitor the intentions of others, seeking to conform to their preferences, even 
beginning to internalize their preferences and at the same time also developing 
larger and more flexible vocal repertoires?
Many factors were involved in the evolution of language (see Locke & Bogin, 
Chap. 10, this volume). Some clearly had to do with the unusual way apes in the line 
leading to Homo sapiens were reared. Learning language is a highly social endeavor. 
Anyone who has ever spent time with babies knows that their mother is not the only 
person who speaks to them in high-pitched “motherese.” It is from eagerly listening 
to others that youngsters acquire new phonemes and words. Immatures learn new 
sounds better in the presence of someone else than when by themselves. As young 
as 9 months, babies watching instructive videos more readily discriminate sounds 
and learn foreign phonemes if another child is present (Lytle et al., 2018).
Not only current interactions but also past experiences with others influence chil-
dren’s readiness to mentalize what someone else knows. When experimenters set up 
a computer game where 5-year-olds must explain to someone else where to collect 
a digital prize, they were told that the unseen other (really the experimenters’ con-
federate) was either a toddler or another 5-year-old. Subjects adjusted instructions 
accordingly. When told their partner was a toddler, subjects spent longer explaining 
the game than when they assumed the other child was older. The more days between 
birth and age four that the subject had spent with others in daycare, the readier that 
child was to take the other’s level of understanding into account, mentalizing what 
they were likely to already know (Stolk et al., 2013).

178
8.4.3  Concern for Reputation and Learning
Within the first year of life, hominins approaching this level of emotional modernity 
would, like behaviorally modern humans today, actively seek to become the object 
of someone else’s attention, feel at least a glimmer of pride when approved of, 
shame when disapproved of (Reddy, 2003; Trevarthen & Aitken, 2001). After a year 
or so, these youngsters may have already been disposed to spontaneously offer 
something interesting or desirable to someone else, the way 14-month-old behavior-
ally modern humans do today, even proffering an item differing from their own 
preference (Repacholi & Gopnik, 1997). Although it has long been assumed that the 
ability to reason about what others are thinking (Theory of Mind, TOM) does not 
develop until around age 4, as early as 2.5 children clearly have learned how to 
conform to the preferences of others. Capacities for intuiting the perspectives and 
preferences of others appear to be supported by different, independently maturing, 
brain networks. Recent research using magnetic resonance imaging points to differ-
ent areas of the brain involved in later developing more verbal and explicit 
TOM. These largely preverbal capacities involved in “implicit theory of mind” 
emerge earlier in development than do verbal capacities (Wiesmann et al., 2020).
In any event, today’s behaviorally modern Western children readily absorb and 
follow normative rules (Gopnik, 2010, pp. 224–25), expect others to do so, and care 
desperately about their own reputations (Engelmann et al., 2012). When someone is 
trying to teach them something, children not only feel pride at success, but want 
others to know “I did it!” Experiments comparing preschool children with chimpan-
zees show that the former are far more concerned with managing their reputations. 
Children, for example, are more likely to share, less likely to steal, if they are being 
watched by a peer. In contrast, chimpanzees behave the same way whether observed 
by a groupmate or not (Engelmann et al., 2012).
Equipped with sophisticated language, behaviorally modern children employ 
flattery to cultivate the goodwill of others as early as 3 or 4 years of age (Fu & Lee, 
2007). By early adulthood, behaviorally modern humans in developed countries 
today find it so pleasurable to talk about themselves that it stimulates the same neu-
ral regions as anticipating something delicious to eat would (Tamir & Mitchell, 
2012). This concern with presentation of self, reputation, and impressing others 
may fuel tendencies to register the intentions and preferences of others who are 
modeling behavior and then conform. This may explain why human children, but 
not other apes, do not just imitate, they often “over-imitate.” Children add all the 
same ritualized bells and whistles as a demonstrator used even if these are far in 
excess of procedures needed to accomplish the task (Gopnik, 2010; Nielsen et al., 
2014; Whiten et al., 2009). Acute sensitivity to the intentions, thoughts, and prefer-
ences of others, eagerness for their approval and a rush of dopamine and other 
neurochemical rewards when sensing approval, add new dimensions to social 
learning.
Primatewide, youngsters learn to conform to social rules while growing up. 
Monkeys and children alike internalize proper etiquette for approaching a dominant

group member. But human youngsters display a special eagerness to ingratiate 
themselves with others and internalize their preferences, adding subjective dimen-
sions to this quest. Evolutionary psychiatrist Randolph Nesse hypothesizes that run-
away social selection favoring self-consciousness and concern with reputation in 
creatures already interested in mentalizing what others think helps to explain why 
our ancestors evolved the internal self-monitoring we call “a conscience” (Nesse, 
2007, 2019).
Whether or not such ingratiating tendencies encourage humans to behave in fair, 
generous, or civic-minded rather than more self-serving ways is another matter. It 
probably depends more on socioecological contexts and immediate goals than on 
what are sometimes taken to be hard-wired moral sensibilities (Bloom, 2013; 
Hamlin et al., 2010; Hamlin & Wynn, 2011). As early as 6 months, long before 
language, infants exhibit preferences for helpful versus hurtful others (Hamlin & 
Wynn, 2011). However, it is unclear how prosocial versus self-interested such pref-
erences are. In experiments simulating voir dire in an imaginary courtroom, 
Melnikoff and Baliley (2018) asked adult subjects who they would prefer in the 
jury, depending on whether they served as lawyer for the defense or for the prosecu-
tion. The researchers were struck by how conditional on peoples’ current goals their 
preferences for moral vs. immoral actors could be. Whatever standards prevail, 
quests to demonstrate mental and behavioral responses conforming to others’ pref-
erences pave the way for internalizing group norms (Gavriletes & Richerson, 2017) 
and for behavior that group members consider “moral” (Boehm, 2012; Tomasello, 
2016). It is exactly this third-party perspective that is so strikingly deficient in non-
human primates (Burkart et al., 2018a), absent in creatures who otherwise exhibit 
many critical building blocks for morality (de Waal, 2006; Silk & House, 2016). 
Other primates may conform to local traditions, but they do not seem to care much 
if others do so or not, and even unusually prosocial primates such as marmosets do 
not manage their reputations by increasing their helpfulness when observed by oth-
ers (Burkart et al., 2018a). But like great apes, early hominins would almost cer-
tainly have been able to theorize about what others knew (Krupenye et al., 2016) 
and over the course of human evolution became distinctively motivated to care 
about their reputations. This same aptitude would presumably have been advanta-
geous for cooperatively breeding marmosets as well, but they may have simply 
lacked the cognitive infrastructure to register how they appear to others.
8.5  Conclusions
Across taxa, earlier weaning, shorter inter-birth intervals, and longer spans of post-­
weaning (or in the case of birds, post-fledging) dependence are predictable corollar-
ies of cooperative breeding. In the case of the cooperatively breeding apes in the line 
leading to the genus Homo, reliance on care and provisioning from alloparents as 
well as parents, conditioned dependent immatures to develop an un-ape-like eager-
ness to monitor and care about the intentions of others, mentalize what they were

thinking and feeling, and seek to ingratiate themselves with them leading to the 
expression and refinement of otherwise latent ape potentials. This novel context for 
development and social learning coincided with directional social selection (West-­
Eberhard, 1983, 2003) favoring youngsters best at ingratiating themselves with pro-
tectors, mentors, and providers. By 2 million years ago, this combined process of 
development-plus-social selection was already contributing toward the emergence 
of cognitive and emotional phenotypes in hominins that were very different from 
those among our Last Common Ancestors with chimpanzees and other great apes.
Without any foresight on Mother Nature’s part concerning how important quest-
ing for intersubjective engagement and escalating concerns with reputations would 
eventually turn out to be, Homo erectus infants would have been conditioned to 
monitor and care about what others were thinking, including thinking about them. 
They would have been rewarded for internalizing their preferences in ways other 
apes are not. Resulting concerns with reputation make having a conscience increas-
ingly useful. Long before the emergence of anatomically modern big-brained 
humans by 300,000 years ago (Hublin et al., 2017), or before behaviorally modern 
humans with symbolic thought and language, these emotionally different apes were 
already eager to appeal to and help others. Although activities such as group hunting 
or inter-group warfare are frequently cited as the contexts in which greater inter-­
individual cooperation, communication skills, and helpfulness evolved, such expla-
nations do not fit with the observation that helpful tendencies emerge early and in 
both sexes, with girls if anything better able to interpret others’ expressions and 
feelings than boys (Geary, 2018).
By the Late Pleistocene as cooperative hunting of big game, division of labor, 
and sharing of food became more important, hominins of both sexes must already 
have become predisposed to read the intentions of others in order to coordinate with 
and help them (Hawkes, 2014; Hrdy, 2009, 2016a; Tomasello & Gonzalez-Cabrera, 
2017). By the time coordinated hunting of large animals was established in the 
human repertoire – whether by 400,000 years ago as in Tomasello’s reconstruction 
or closer to Chris Boehm’s “magic number” (Boehm, 2012, p. 313) of 250,000 years 
ago – it was probably accompanied by “punitive social selection” against stingy or 
overly domineering men as documented for hunter-gatherer societies (Boehm, 
2012, p. 164; Tomasello, 2016, 2018). If so, these members of the genus Homo 
would have already become motivationally very different from their more self-­
centered, solipsistic ape ancestors. In Boehm’s account, sanctions against bullies 
could extend to exile or even execution of offenders, pressuring them to conform to 
and adopt group norms, behave in a “moral” way. We suggest that with internaliza-
tion of norms underway, archaic humans would already have been, from an early 
age, sensitive to what others felt and thought about them, concerned about personal 
reputations, and eager to cooperate. Hominins were preadapted to internalize ways 
of behaving and expressing themselves that others preferred.
The higher-quality food and multiple provisioners that buffered weanlings from 
recurring food shortages in the Late Pleistocene would have lifted the gray ceiling 
limiting energy available for brains. The stage was set for these emotionally modern 
early humans to meet new social and ecological challenges in ways that would favor

the evolution of even more costly, anatomically modern, brains. Expanding social 
networks and accompanying motivations would also encourage the emergence of 
more sophisticated modes of vocal communication that would vastly expand both 
the ability to learn from multiple others (via gossip and teaching) and expand the 
reach and importance both of normative ways of doing things (Richerson & Boyd, 
2020) and of reputations. Such processes would stress conformity and further favor 
the internalization of group norms and human indoctrinability, hallmarks of behav-
iorally modern humans.

Evolutionary Perspectives  
on Infant-­Mother Conflict
Catherine Salmon and Jessica Hehman
The image of mother and child is often celebrated in artistic depictions as a harmo-
nious unit with mother willing to sacrifice all for the well-being of her child. At first 
glance, it appears to be a relationship that begins in perfect harmony. Images, fic-
tional accounts, and other artistic descriptions of the synergy between mother and 
child are ubiquitous across time and culture. Historically, they have typically 
focused on doting adoring mothers and helpless infants, such as in The Adoration of 
the Child by Correggio or L’Innocence by William Adolphe Bouguereau, while 
reports of mothers who risk their own lives by delaying cancer treatment while 
pregnant are not uncommon in modern news. And yet the harmony often depicted 
also seems at odds with the modern image of typical parent-child relationships as 
full of strife. Is either accurate? While mothers typically invest a great deal in their 
offspring and are often highly devoted (Salmon & Hehman, 2021), the image of the 
all-sacrificing mother is certainly not always accurate, as data on child neglect, 
abuse, and infanticide reveal (Daly & Wilson, 1980, 1984, 1988).
From an evolutionary perspective, offspring are the vehicle of parental fitness 
and, as such, parent-child interactions can be highly cooperative, but they can also 
involve significant conflict (Salmon, 2008; Salmon & Malcolm, 2011). While there 
may be agreement about the general goal of offspring fitness, conflict can arise over 
allocation of investment in one offspring versus another. Activities that advance the 
fitness of one offspring can potentially reduce the lifetime reproductive success of 
the mother and vice versa. As a result, we would expect individuals to allocate their 
parental investment among their offspring in ways that optimize their own inclusive 
fitness. All other things being equal, parents are equally related to each of their off-
spring (Daly & Wilson, 1980; Kilner & Hinde, 2008; Trivers, 1974). However, we 
would expect individual offspring to have somewhat different perspectives as they 
are more closely related to themselves than their siblings and thus might benefit

from extracting more than their share of maternal resources (Godfray, 1995; Hinde 
et al., 2010). In addition, maternal circumstances can impact offspring fitness in 
ways that may shift maternal investment away from offspring and toward maternal 
somatic investment or future reproductive success.
In this chapter, we will examine areas of conflict between mothers and infants, 
beginning with a review of the relevant theoretical literature, and continuing with a 
focus on both prenatal and postnatal conflict. Some areas in need of further explora-
tion will also be addressed.
9.1  Theoretical Approaches to Mother-Offspring Conflict
From the parental perspective, each individual’s overall reproductive effort is a 
combination of mating effort (time spent obtaining a mate, etc.) and parental effort 
or investment. Trivers (1972, 1974) defined parental investment as any investment 
by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring’s chance of sur-
viving (and hence reproductive potential) at the cost of the parent’s ability to invest 
in other offspring (either current or future). In many species, it involves such things 
as food provisioning and protection from predators. In humans, it can involve much 
more, though for infants pre- and postnatal, food and protection are major compo-
nents. In general, an offspring’s fitness increases with the amount of parental invest-
ment it receives. In species with parental care, we can assume that extremely low 
levels of parental investment may result in offspring loss because a certain amount 
of investment is necessary for survival. However, a point of diminishing returns is 
also eventually met at very high levels of parental investment because offspring are 
unable to capitalize on investment over and above a certain amount. For most mam-
mals, investment in offspring is substantially greater for females than for males 
(Babchuk et al., 1985; Clutton-Brock, 1991), starting with internal fertilization, ges-
tation, and significant postnatal nutrition via maternal lactation. In fact, it is not an 
exaggeration to state that the most essential mammalian relationship is that between 
mother and offspring. Even for pair-bonding humans, where fathers could, and 
sometimes do contribute to parental care, mothers typically contribute 50% or more 
to direct infant care (Marlowe, 2005).
Hamilton’s rule (1964) can shed light on how parents and offspring behave with 
regard to parental investment. Hamilton developed the concept of inclusive fitness, 
noting that when we assess the fitness of a trait or behavior, we need to consider its 
contribution to the reproduction of that individual and to whether it influences the 
reproductive prospects of its kin. The inequality that sums up the conditions under 
which a particular behavior would be expected to spread is c < rb, where c equals 
the fitness cost of the action (food provisioning) to the actor, b is the benefit to the 
recipient (food to eat), and r is the degree of relatedness between the actor and 
recipient (0.5 for parent and offspring, 0.5 for full siblings, 0.25 for half-siblings). 
Clearly, a parent’s investment in its offspring provides a benefit to the offspring 
which in turn benefits the parent’s inclusive fitness. As long as the cost of parental 
C. Salmon and J. Hehman

191
investment does not outweigh the benefit for the offspring times the degree of relat-
edness, it should continue. Similarly, in a brood of two equal siblings, A and B, from 
Hamilton’s rule (1964), A should continue to take resources until its marginal gains 
drop to one-half those of B, who gets the remainder (Parker et al., 1989).
The key point is the degree of relatedness. A child shares a given gene with itself 
with a probability of 1.0, but it shares the same gene with its sibling with a probabil-
ity of 0.5 (same as with each parent). As a result, a child is expected to try to obtain 
resources (or continue to monopolize them in the case of nursing) unless the value 
of that resource to that child drops below the value, multiplied by the degree of 
relatedness, of giving that resource to their sibling. Parents are equally related to all 
of their offspring and are therefore motivated to distribute resources equally unless 
a child is better able to benefit from the resource than others. Not all offspring are 
equally good fitness vehicles. As a result, selection has favored mechanisms of 
parental care that sometimes increase parental fitness by favoring investment in one 
child over another or by terminating investment entirely. (For a review of parent-­
offspring conflict in humans and non-human primates, see Maestripieri, 2002; 
Salmon & Malcolm, 2011).
Discriminative parental solicitude explains variability in mothers’ responsive-
ness to their offspring across individuals as well as variability within individuals 
who have multiple offspring. That is, discriminative parental solicitude refers to 
factors that determine the quality and quantity of care a mother directs to her off-
spring. From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense that natural selection 
would design mechanisms that allocate parental investment. Specifically, these 
mechanisms would allow parents to discriminate among neonates (i.e., identify 
their own offspring) as well as discriminate between their own potential offspring. 
Otherwise, there is the risk of misdirecting care and resources to (1) offspring that 
are not their own, and (2) offspring that are not likely to survive to maturity (Daly 
& Wilson, 1980; Wilson & Daly, 1994). Therefore, mechanisms that regulate paren-
tal motivation to care for any offspring should be sensitive to a host of different 
offspring, parental, and situational cues to the likelihood of the child surviving and 
achieving reproductive success. These cues include the reproductive value of the 
infant (e.g., health, cues to deformity); available resources (e.g., the mother’s own 
health and ability to provide, social support); and potential costs of trade-off between 
investing in current offspring and investing in other current or potential future off-
spring (e.g., maternal age). In the rest of the chapter, we will explore how mother-­
infant conflict plays out in humans, focusing on prenatal and postnatal conflict and 
the factors that influence the degree of conflict. 
9.2  Prenatal Conflict
Contrary to the idyllic perception of pregnancy as a time of ultimate harmonious 
cooperation between a mother and her offspring, substantial evidence indicates that 
pregnancy is a time of conflict. The two main sources of prenatal conflict are (1) the 
9  Evolutionary Perspectives on Infant-Mother Conflict

192
genetic quality of the fetus, and (2) the amount of maternal resources directed to the 
fetus. Examination of prenatal conflict demonstrates how mothers and fetuses have 
evolved adaptations to manage/balance their genetic interests during pregnancy. 
From the fetus’s perspective, it is in its best interest to get as many resources as it 
can to ensure its survival, even at the cost of current and/or potential future siblings. 
From the mother’s perspective, however, it is in her best interest to only direct her 
investment to viable offspring. Therefore, whereas the fetus has evolved ways to 
decrease the likelihood of spontaneous abortion and to increase the delivery of 
nutrients, mothers have evolved ways to “test” the genetic quality of fetus. 
Consequently, prenatal conflict reflects the interplay between a co-evolved system 
of adaptations for the fetus to signal its quality and avoid being aborted and for the 
mother to accurately assess the fetal quality and not be manipulated or tricked into 
the poor investment of her resources.
9.2.1  Genetic Quality and Spontaneous Abortions
The mother’s first “test” of fetal genetic quality, as well as the first example of the 
fetus manipulating the mother’s body for its own benefit, is the fetus’s ability to 
overcome the mother’s resistance (i.e., pending shedding of uterine wall with men-
struation) and successfully implant in the uterine wall (Haig, 1993). In order to 
accomplish this feat, the developing embryo must produce human chorionic gonad-
otropin (hCG), a placental hormone. Before implantation, human embryos begin 
production and release of this placental hormone into the mother’s bloodstream 
which serves to maintain levels of progesterone, thus, effectively preventing the 
shedding of the uterine lining and allowing for implantation of the embryo in the 
uterine wall. If the embryo is not able to produce adequate levels of hCG, menstrua-
tion would ensue and rid the mother’s body of any fetal cells (Haig, 1993, 2010b). 
In situations where the mother would benefit more by investing in higher quality, 
existing or future, offspring and/or when environmental and social conditions are 
more favorable for the mother, this first early test of genetic quality to allow for 
implantation would be extremely important to minimize costs and prevent mother 
from carrying a fetus that is unlikely to survive and reproduce itself 1 day (Kotler, 
2016). Beyond implantation, fetal production of hCG remains important throughout 
the pregnancy as progesterone is required to maintain the pregnancy. By the eighth 
week of gestation, the production of mother’s progesterone is completely taken over 
by the fetus as a function of releasing hCG into mother’s blood system (Dokras 
et al., 1991). Without fetal control, mother’s progesterone levels would decrease and 
shedding of the placenta and uterine wall, along with any fetal cells, would occur.
Most early miscarriages (or spontaneous abortions) are genetic “quality control” 
in the sense that the fetuses show genetic abnormalities (Ellish et al., 1996; Forbes, 
2017; Haig, 1993, 2010b; Kotler, 2016). Oftentimes, early pregnancy loss (EPL), 
spontaneous abortion that occurs within 14 days of conception due to failure to 
implant in the uterine wall cannot be distinguished from typical menstruation (Ellish 
C. Salmon and J. Hehman

193
et al., 1996). The likelihood of an EPL can be predicted by the level of hCG at 
implantation, with less hCG production linked to an increased likelihood of mater-
nal rejection (Forbes, 2017). In a sample of 217 women (for a total of 1253 men-
strual cycles) between the ages of 22 and 35 who were trying to get pregnant, 
urinalysis tracking of hCG levels indicated an EPL incidence rate between 17% and 
27% where implantation would not have occurred (Ellish et al., 1996). A follow-up 
found approximately 14% of the confirmed pregnancies (i.e., where implantation 
had occurred) ended in a spontaneous abortion. The majority of these spontaneous 
abortions occurred between 7 and 13 weeks of gestation, but one occurred earlier at 
around 6 weeks of gestation and one occurred later at around 16 weeks of gestation. 
All of the observed EPLs and later spontaneous abortions were associated with 
inadequate fetal production of hCG (Ellish et al., 1996). An investigation of the 
genetic quality of fetuses spontaneously aborted within the first trimester indicated 
that up to 83% of the fetuses had chromosomal abnormalities that would have lim-
ited their ability to survive and reproduce (Strom et al., 1992). In fact, there is evi-
dence to suggest that embryos with greater chromosomal and/or structural 
abnormalities are spontaneously aborted earlier than other aborted embryos (Forbes, 
2017). To the extent that EPLs and spontaneous abortions minimize costs to the 
mother in terms of preventing investment in unfit offspring, EPLs and spontaneous 
abortions have been characterized as an adaptive strategy to increase female repro-
ductive success (Kotler, 2016). Specifically, the adaptive response is to induce ear-
lier reproductive loss to reduce the investment loss of the mother.
Prenatal conflict has been characterized as “cooperative conflict” and may play 
an important role in signaling information to mother and fetus (Haig, 1993). The 
fetus’s ability to overcome the mother’s tests and resistance signals its genetic qual-
ity and greater developmental competence to the mother; while the strength of the 
mother’s resistance signals to the fetus the cost of the demands being placed on the 
mother (i.e., greater maternal resistance indicates greater cost burden on the mother). 
Fetuses have been selected to demonstrate their genetic viability by the production 
of hCG, and mothers have been selected to demand certain levels of hCG to allow 
implantation and carrying of the offspring (Forbes, 2017).
Nausea and pregnancy sickness have also been linked to hCG levels and fetal 
adaptations to avoid spontaneous abortion. A popular explanation for this relation-
ship is that hCG induces pregnancy sickness to protect the fetus from spontaneous 
abortion via maternal food aversions to dairy, meat, eggs, and seafood, which may 
carry pathogens or harmful toxins (Haig, 1993). Consistent with the fetoprotective 
explanation, for most women, pregnancy sickness is most severe (if not completely 
limited to) the embryonic stage of development. This is the stage in which the 
embryo develops all the parts, organs, systems, etc. required to make a viable human 
being. Based on the timing of pregnancy sickness, some researchers have suggested 
that pregnancy sickness evolved as an adaptive mechanism to prevent the mother 
from ingesting harmful substances that would interfere with the development of the 
fetus (Profet, 1988, 1992). Consistent with the idea that pregnancy sickness evolved 
to prevent developmental risks from teratogens, there is evidence that women who 
have pregnancy sickness are less likely to have a spontaneous abortion than those 
9  Evolutionary Perspectives on Infant-Mother Conflict

194
that do not have pregnancy sickness (Haig, 1993; Profet, 1992). Recent research 
suggests that the association between pregnancy sickness and spontaneous abortion 
increases with maternal age, and is strongest in mothers over the age of 35 (Forbes, 
2017). While pregnancy sickness may be a fetal attempt to avoid spontaneous abor-
tion, it has also been suggested that the severity of nausea and pregnancy sickness 
itself may be an indication of fetal genetic quality, with higher quality fetuses better 
able to manipulate the mother’s system and induce pregnancy sickness than those of 
lower genetic quality (Haig, 1993; Forbes, 2017).
9.2.2  Genomic Imprinting
It is important to note that prenatal genetic conflict is not only between the mother 
and fetus, but also within the fetus itself (i.e., between genes inherited from mother 
and those inherited from father; henceforth, referred to as maternal and paternal 
genes). Genes that are expressed differently as a function of whether they were 
inherited from the mother versus the father are referred to as imprinted genes (Haig, 
1993). This conflict arises due to the three different sets of genetic interests: moth-
er’s genes; maternal genes passed to the fetus; and paternal genes passed to the fetus 
(Haig, 1993, 2019). According to the parental conflict theory of genomic imprint-
ing, differential expression of maternal and paternal genes evolved because levels of 
expression that maximize maternal inclusive fitness are not necessarily the same 
levels of expression to maximize paternal inclusive fitness (Haig & Wharton, 2003). 
Therefore, this theory predicts that maternal genes that benefit the offspring but 
pose costs to maternal reproductive value would be turned off; and paternal genes 
that benefit maternal reproductive value but pose a cost to the fitness of the offspring 
would be turned off. As pointed out by Haig (1993, 2019), this conflict is exacer-
bated when mothers have children fathered by more than one male. In such situa-
tions, paternal genes maximize their interests by ensuring investment in the current 
developing fetus, whereas maternal genes may maximize their interests by diverting 
the investment to either current or future offspring. Furthermore, there is evidence 
that maternal and paternal genes serve different functions essential for prenatal 
development, including placental development, implantation, and fetal growth and 
nutrition (Haig, 1993).
Evidence for the differential role of maternal and paternal genes largely comes 
from the investigation of atypical prenatal development. For example, abnormal 
embryo and placenta development have been linked to atypical ratios of maternal 
versus paternal genes (Haig, 1993). An overabundance of paternal cells is associ-
ated with placental overgrowth. The effect of paternal gene overabundance on the 
developing fetus ranges from the complete absence of embryonic fetal cells to a 
well-developed fetus with a proportionally small head. In contrast, an overabun-
dance of maternal cells is associated with a smaller placenta and a fetus with an 
underdeveloped body and proportionally large head. These observations indicate 
not only the importance of paternal genes in the development of the placenta, but the 
C. Salmon and J. Hehman

195
delicate balance of the maternal and paternal genes required for optimal prenatal 
development.
Another aspect of prenatal development in which the genetic conflict between 
maternally and paternally imprinted genes can be observed is the implantation pro-
cess. Greater invasion into the uterine lining is associated with greater blood flow 
(and thus, nutrients delivered) to the placenta and developing fetus. Upon implanta-
tion, the trophoblast burrows into the uterine lining until the cells begin to differenti-
ate in the development of an embryo. While paternally imprinted genes increase 
invasiveness, driving the trophoblast to burrow further into the uterine wall by 
favoring delayed differentiation, maternally imprinted genes limit the invasion by 
favoring earlier differentiation of embryonic cells (Haig, 1993). Although further 
invasion into the uterine tissue allowing for greater blood flow and nutrients deliv-
ered to the placenta may be in the best interest of the fetus (and its paternal cells), it 
may be in the best interest of the mother to restrict resources and avoid costly 
over-investment.
The genetic conflict between imprinted genes is also observed in several 
imprinted-gene disorders. One such disorder is Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, 
which occurs with overexpression of paternal genes and underexpression of mater-
nal genes (Haig, 2010a). Consistent with predictions that paternal genes would be 
selected to enhance patrilineal inclusive fitness at a cost to matrilineal inclusive fit-
ness, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is associated with fetal overgrowth. This 
overgrowth represents manipulation of the mother to receive more resources than 
necessary for typical growth and poses considerable health risks to the mother in 
supporting the fetus in utero as well as safely delivering a larger baby.
Imprinted-gene disorders associated with overexpression of maternal genes and 
underexpression of paternal genes include Silver-Russell syndrome, Prader-Willi 
syndrome, and Temple syndrome (Haig, 2010a). Contrary to paternal genes, mater-
nal genes are selected to promote reduced demands on mothers. That is, the pheno-
types expressed in imprinted maternal gene disorders benefit matrilineal inclusive 
fitness at the expense of patrilineal inclusive fitness. While the effects of Temple 
syndrome are largely observed in feeding behavior following birth (i.e., less intense 
sucking and earlier weaning), Silver-Russell syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome 
influence prenatal development as well as postnatal behaviors (Haig, 2010a; Haig & 
Wharton, 2003; Kotler, 2016). Silver-Russell syndrome is associated with stunted 
uterine growth and shorter gestation periods (i.e., by about 2–3 weeks). While a 
longer gestational period would benefit the offspring’s fitness, longer gestational 
periods pose an increasing cost to the mother’s fitness (i.e., increased risk of birth 
complications). Prader-Willi syndrome is associated with low birthweight, though 
head circumference and length do not seem to be affected (Haig & Wharton, 2003). 
In fact, infants with Prader-Willi syndrome appear to develop normally until late in 
pregnancy when they do not store fat typical of that stage of development. The lack 
of typical fat store accumulation could be due to insufficient placental growth (i.e., 
not able to support increased nutrient needs at end of pregnancy) or because the 
fetus was not able to successfully override mother’s system to increase the flow of 
nutrients (Haig & Wharton, 2003).
9  Evolutionary Perspectives on Infant-Mother Conflict

196
One of the clearest illustrations of the genetic conflict of interest between mater-
nal and paternal genes comes from the comparison of Prader-Willi syndrome with 
Angelman syndrome. Both Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome are imprinted-­
gene disorders involving the same chromosome, but have opposite effects on the 
developing phenotype depending on whether the maternal or paternal genes are 
expressed (Kotler, 2016). If missing the paternal gene, the Prader-Willi syndrome 
phenotype develops characterized by stunted growth (as described above). However, 
if missing the maternal gene, the Angelman syndrome phenotype develops charac-
terized after birth as having increased sociality encouraging greater interaction with 
caregivers (Brown & Consedine, 2004). The opposite effects observed in Prader-­
Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome as a function of which genes are expressed 
demonstrate that maternal genes have been selected to reduce costs to mother, 
whereas paternal genes have been selected to increase maternal investment (prena-
tally and postnatally, which would presumably also reduce the likelihood of mater-
nal rejection following birth). 
9.2.3  Fetal Microchimerism
Fetal microchimerism refers to the phenomenon in which a small number of fetal 
cells (i.e., of distinct genetic quality to that of the mother), transferred across the 
placental barrier during pregnancy, are found to persist in the mother’s system for 
decades after she gives birth (Boddy et al., 2015; Glynn et al., 2018). Although the 
flow of maternal and fetal cells during pregnancy is bi-directional, the exchange of 
cells itself is asymmetrical. Specifically, more fetal cells are transferred to the 
mother (versus maternal cells to the fetus), and the transfer of fetal cells increases 
with gestational age. Once integrated into the mother’s system, the fetal cells may 
then influence her physiology to enhance resource transfer during (and after) preg-
nancy in ways consistent with the genetic best interest of the offspring, and not the 
genetic best interest of the mother (Haig, 2019). In fact, menstruation and postpar-
tum hemorrhage have been suggested to be adaptations to protect mothers from the 
invasive fetal cells that are capable of manipulating maternal behavior and physiol-
ogy in ways that are not always in the mother’s best interest (Abrams & Rutherford, 
2011; Haig, 2019).
Although humans have the most invasive placenta physiology (relative to other 
placental mammals), and despite the great diversity in placental physiology and 
morphology among mammals, microchimerism is not specific to humans. Rather, 
microchimerism has been found to be common among placental mammals (Boddy 
et al., 2015). Diversity in placenta type across mammals is posited to reflect differ-
ent selection pressures, including those arising from mother-offspring conflict, 
across that species’ evolutionary past. The human invasive placenta type (i.e., 
hemochorial) serves the adaptive function of increasing nutrient transfer to the fetus 
and, in doing so, may also allow for greater transfer of cells between the mother and 
fetus (Boddy et  al., 2015). Consistent with the proposed function of fetal 
C. Salmon and J. Hehman

197
microchimerism to increase fetal exploitation and manipulation of maternal 
resources, fetal cells have been identified in many organs and tissues throughout the 
mother’s system, including sites of resource transfer (e.g., the breast, thyroid, and 
brain) and immune response (e.g., wound sites). The evidence regarding the effect 
of fetal microchimerism on maternal health, however, is inconclusive, with some 
studies finding positive effects on maternal health and others finding negative effects 
(Boddy et al., 2015).
Two factors that account for some of the discrepancies in findings regarding the 
effect of fetal microchimerism on maternal health are (1) the mother’s own immune 
response (i.e., ability to limit the transfer of the fetal cells and the strength of the 
fetal cells’ response to the mother’s defenses), and (2) the location and specific 
function of the fetal cells (Boddy et al., 2015). Some fetal cells have been found to 
serve important functions in maternal wound healing, tissue repair, and replenish-
ment of stem cells. For example, fetal cells have been observed in scar tissue follow-
ing cesarean sections suggesting that they enhance maternal healing following 
pregnancy (Mahmood & O’Donoghue, 2014). Therefore, fetal cells that aid in 
somatic maintenance provide a benefit to maternal health. Fetal cells located in tis-
sues and organs that regulate resource transfer (e.g., breast, thyroid, and brain) were 
predicted to have negative effects on maternal health, if the mother’s system is 
exploited for more resources than what is in her best interest to provide (Boddy 
et al., 2015). Tests of this prediction in human studies have yielded inconsistent 
findings, both within the same resource transfer sites as well as between them. 
9.2.4  Conflict Over Resources Directed to Fetus
The quantity and quality of resources delivered to the fetus are regulated by two 
factors of the mother’s vascular system: (1) maternal blood pressure, with higher 
blood pressure associated with more resources, and (2) maternal blood glucose lev-
els, with higher glucose levels associated with more resources (Arthur et al., 2018; 
Haig, 1993). Therefore, maternal blood pressure regulates the quantity of resources 
directed to the fetus; and maternal blood glucose levels regulate the quality of the 
resources directed to the fetus. The fetus gains control over the mother’s vascular 
system upon implantation, with further invasion into the uterine tissue associated 
with greater fetal vascular control of maternal arteries responsible for sending blood 
and nutrients to the fetus (Haig, 1993).
Throughout pregnancy, conflict over maternal blood pressure is evident by the 
synchronous fetal production of vasoconstrictors (increasing blood pressure and 
delivery of resources to the placenta) and maternal counter-production of vasodila-
tors (reducing blood pressure). In the beginning of pregnancy, maternal blood pres-
sure tends to be low and tends to increase in the second half of pregnancy as the 
fetus exerts more pull on resources by increasing vascular resistance (and hence 
maternal blood pressure) as it grows larger (Haig, 1993). Fetal outcomes of gesta-
tional hypertension (high blood pressure during pregnancy without protein in the 
9  Evolutionary Perspectives on Infant-Mother Conflict

198
urine) include increased birthweight, enhanced fetal growth, and lower incidence of 
stillbirths and neonatal mortality (Haig, 1993). Gestational hypertension is not typi-
cally associated with other negative maternal health consequences, and maternal 
blood pressure typically returns to normal in a few weeks following birth. Therefore, 
the fetal benefit of gestational hypertension appears to be at a relatively low risk to 
maternal health.
Dysregulation of the conflict over maternal blood pressure, however, can lead to 
preeclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy accompanied with protein in 
the urine), which poses a significant health risk to the mother and potentially the 
fetus (Arthur et al., 2018; Espinoza, 2016). Worldwide, it is estimated that 10–19% 
of maternal deaths are due to preeclampsia (Brown et al., 2013). Some of the more 
threatening maternal complications include kidney failure, seizures, hemorrhage, 
and cardiac arrest (Brown et al., 2013; Haig, 1993). Potential fetal complications 
associated with preeclampsia include increased risk of low birthweight, prematu-
rity, and stillbirth (Haig, 1993). In consideration of the substantial maternal and 
fetal risks, some researchers have proposed the fetal actions leading to preeclampsia 
(i.e., upregulation of vasoconstrictors to increase maternal blood pressure) may be 
an extreme survival tactic for an undernourished fetus to increase its chances of 
survival (Espinoza, 2016; Haig, 1993). Consistent with this suggestion, poor pla-
cental perfusion (indicative of less invasive burrowing at implantation and therefore 
fewer resources being delivered to the fetus) has been found to exist in many pre-
eclamptic pregnancies (Arthur et  al., 2018; Espinoza, 2016; Haig, 1993; Varas 
Enriquez et al., 2018). Together with the timing of preeclampsia (usually develop-
ing in the third trimester), this indicates that (1) poor fetal growth from lack of 
adequate resources may precede fetal actions leading to preeclampsia, and (2) those 
actions may indeed be an evolved “last chance” survival strategy to increase the 
amount of resources being delivered to the placenta (Haig, 1993).
It is important to note that in addition to fetal production of vasoconstrictors, 
there is evidence to suggest genomic imprinting also plays a role in the development 
of preeclampsia. A recent study found evidence of molecular genetic evolution indi-
cating positive selection on a particular gene known to be strongly related to the risk 
of preeclampsia (Arthur et al., 2018). Arthur et al. (2018) proposed that the expres-
sion of the gene is triggered by the lack of sufficient embryonic invasion with 
implantation. Once triggered, the gene produces cytotoxins that damage the endo-
thelial lining of maternal blood vessels. This damage causes the blood vessels to 
constrict, increasing vascular resistance and maternal blood pressure (Haig, 1993). 
It also causes serum proteins to leak out, leading to protein in the urine (Haig, 
1993). Though research in this area is still somewhat limited, there is other recent 
evidence to suggest other genetic signaling mechanisms may be used by the fetus in 
an attempt to compensate for limited blood flow to the placenta (e.g., adenosine, a 
building block of RNA) (Espinoza, 2016). Therefore, in extreme circumstances of 
fetal undernourishment that are presumed to lead to preeclampsia, fetal control over 
the quantity of resources it receives appears to be accomplished through multiple 
mechanisms including the balance between fetal-produced vasoconstrictors and 
maternal-produced vasodilators as well as imprinted genes.

A main vehicle for fetal control of the quality of resources it receives is the pla-
cental hormone, human placental lactogen (hPL) (Haig, 1993). Along with hCG and 
other placental hormones, hPL passes through the placenta to the mother where it 
acts on maternal prolactin receptors and increases maternal resistance to insulin. 
Early in the pregnancy, maternal fasting levels of blood glucose start out low. After 
6 weeks of gestation, fetal production of hPL begins (Di Cianni et al., 2003). Fetal 
manipulation of maternal metabolism then ensues for the remainder of the preg-
nancy as maternal glucose and insulin levels begin to not only increase, but also stay 
higher for longer periods of time (Di Cianni et al., 2003; Haig, 1993). This leads to 
more nutrient-rich blood being delivered to the placenta, and the fetus having longer 
to extract as many nutrients as it can. As fetal production of hPL increases, maternal 
production of insulin increases to compensate for (and fight against) the fetal pull 
on resources (Di Cianni et al., 2003; Haig, 1993). Across pregnancy, insulin sensi-
tivity is estimated to decrease between 50% and 80% (Di Cianni et  al., 2003). 
Similarly, insulin secretion progressively increases following the first trimester, 
peaking in the third trimester and returning to normal following birth (Di Cianni 
et al., 2003). Thus, this interplay provides yet another example of the intricate con-
flict and coadaptation between mother and fetus.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic condition in which pregnant 
women develop insulin resistance so that their glucose levels remain high for 
extended periods of time. In other words, GDM occurs when the mother is unable 
to upregulate her insulin production to effectively compensate for the fetal-induced 
insulin resistance (Haig, 1993). Recent estimates suggest that approximately 9.2% 
of mothers in the United States who gave birth in 2010 had GDM (De Sisto et al., 
2014), though other estimates of GDM range from 3% to 14% of pregnancies 
affected by GDM (Giannubilo et al., 2018) with estimates of up to 20% in some 
cultures worldwide (Brown et al., 2013). While the actual prevalence of GDM is 
still unclear, the negative maternal and fetal outcomes are well known.
GDM is associated with increased pregnancy and delivery complications, includ-
ing the need for cesarean delivery due to infant macrosomia where the fetus grows 
large for its gestational age (i.e., too large to fit through the mother’s pelvis) (De 
Sisto et al., 2014; Di Cianni et al., 2003; Giannubilo et al., 2018). The longer and 
more severe the GDM, the larger the risk of cesarean delivery and infant macroso-
mia (Di Cianni et al., 2003). Because infants with macrosomia are too large to be 
delivered to through the mother’s pelvis, before cesarean deliveries, mothers with 
GDM and their infants were not likely to survive (Brown et al., 2013). Other fetal 
outcomes associated with GDM include hypertrophic myocardiopathy, typically 
leading to cardiac arrest in the first few months of life; respiratory distress syn-
drome; hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesia (i.e., low levels of blood 
sugar, calcium, and magnesium, respectively); hyperbilirubinemia (i.e., elevated 
bilirubin levels); and hypoxemia (i.e., low blood oxygen levels) – all of which can 
significantly threaten perinatal outcomes (Di Cianni et al., 2003). Long-term effects 
on children of mothers with GDM include a higher risk for childhood obesity and 
diabetes later in life (Giannubilo et al., 2018). Long-term effects of GDM on mater-
nal health also include a higher risk of developing Type II diabetes

(Giannubilo et al., 2018). Therefore, the fetal benefit of increased resources via this 
pathway comes at a high cost to both the fetus and mother, during pregnancy 
and beyond.
Similar to the mechanisms underlying conflict over maternal blood, hPL is not 
the only mechanism used by the fetus to obtain greater access to resources by influ-
encing maternal metabolic functioning. Recent work found that, controlling for pre-­
pregnancy body mass index and other factors, women carrying male fetuses were 
significantly more likely to develop GDM than those carrying female fetuses 
(Giannubilo et al., 2018). While the mechanism by which fetal sex influences mater-
nal metabolism is still unclear, some researchers proposed the prenatal production 
of testosterone by male fetuses may contribute to maternal insulin resistance 
(Giannubilo et al., 2018).
9.3  Postnatal Conflict
Of course, the conflict between mother and infant does not end after the baby is 
born. Just as there is conflict prenatally over the quality of the fetus itself and over 
the amount of resources it receives, there is postnatal conflict over whether resources 
should be allocated to the infant at all or if resources should be allocated, how much. 
This cost-benefit analysis can end in infanticide when, from the maternal perspec-
tive, investment is too costly.
9.3.1  Infanticide and Child Abandonment
Incidents and practices of infanticide and child abandonment have been examined 
across a wide range of human societies. In general, there are several factors that 
seem to influence the likelihood that the mother will cease investment in her infant. 
On one side of the equation, they include the quality or condition of the child. On 
the other side, there are maternal factors including mother’s age, amount of social 
support she has, and resource availability. These relevant factors should not be sur-
prising considering the earlier discussion of discriminative parental solicitude which 
theoretically varies according to not only relatedness, but with the phenotypic attri-
butes of the child that are predictive of eventual fitness, situational predictors of 
offspring fitness, and alternative reproductive investment opportunities for the 
mother (Wilson & Daly, 1994).
A review of the ethnographic literature reveals a number of studies documenting 
the killing of infants (Daly & Wilson, 1988). In the Ayoreo, who engage in a mix for 
foraging and slash and burn horticulture, deformed or otherwise unwanted infants 
are buried immediately after birth (Bugos & McCarthy, 1984). Some of the women 
report in addition to deformities, a lack of paternal support, twins, or close birth 
spacing as reasons for infanticide. Daly and Wilson (1988) reviewed the Human 
C. Salmon and J. Hehman

201
Relations Area Files (HRAF) and reported 112 infanticidal circumstances, 21 of 
which involved the killing or abandoning of infants due to deformity or severe ill-
ness. Fifty-six involved circumstances that were not favorable for child rearing 
including the birth of twins and a baby being born too close on the heels of an older 
sibling. Similar factors influence the occurrence of infanticide among the 
Tarahumara, an indigenous population of approximately 50,000  in the Mexican 
state of Chihuahua (Mull & Mull, 1987) as well as among the Australian aboriginal 
population (Cowlishaw, 1978).
Even in the modern western world, these fitness-relevant factors are connected to 
infanticide. A systematic review of the research on neonaticide, the killing of an 
infant within the first 24 h of birth, indicates that it is often committed by young, 
poor, and unmarried women (Friedman et al., 2005). These are mothers with little 
current access to the resources they need to raise successful offspring and at the 
same time the ones, due to their young age, with future opportunities to reproduce 
that might be more likely to improve their reproductive success (Wilson & Daly, 
1994). Friedman and Resnick (2007) also highlighted the role of economic factors 
in maternal infanticide. Overpeck et al.’s (1998) analysis of deaths during the first 
year of life in the United States indicated that approximately half of these infanti-
cides occurred within the first 4 months. The two most substantial risk factors were 
maternal youth and a lack of resources. In particular, the risk was substantially 
increased by being a second or later infant born to a mother less than 17 years old 
(compared to first infants born to a woman 25 or older), little prenatal care, and 
lower levels of education. An analysis of 110 cases of mothers killing 123 of their 
own offspring from 1976 to 2010 in Italy explicitly tested adaptationist theories of 
neonaticide, reporting that the neonaticidal mothers were relatively young, poor 
women with no partner support. They killed their offspring non-violently, either 
directly or through abandonment, and attempted to conceal the body (Ciani & 
Fontanesi, 2012). The researchers suggested that neonaticide is an adaptive disin-
vestment, designed to increase the biological fitness of the mother by eliminating an 
unwanted newborn and saving resources for future offspring born under better con-
ditions. Similar results with regard to mothers being young, poor, and with little 
formal education were reported in a study of maternal infanticide in Fiji 
(Adinkrah, 2000).
Hrdy (2016) emphasizes the role of cues of social support in influencing mater-
nal responsiveness, especially in cooperative breeders. In the majority of non-human 
primates, infanticide is committed by females other than the mother or by males 
(Hiraiwa-Hasegawa & Hasegawa, 1994). Hrdy (2016) notes that the only primate 
species where mothers are infanticidal toward their own offspring are those with 
allomaternal care, and that in callitrichids, a shortage of allomaternal assistance is 
the best predictor of maternal rejection. Human mothers also rely on significant 
allomaternal care from friends, family, and sexual partners. In the absence of cues 
of such support, despite the infants’ own best interests, mothers may abandon or 
terminate their offspring in order to achieve greater reproductive success in the 
future. In a similar vein, Lycett and Dunbar’s (1999) study of abortion rates suggests 
some of the same factors that influence postpartum maternal investment also impact 
9  Evolutionary Perspectives on Infant-Mother Conflict

the decision to terminate a pregnancy through abortion. Their data from England 
and Wales indicate that single women were more likely to abort than those ever mar-
ried. In addition, younger single women, with their greater probability of future 
marriage than that of older single women, were more likely to terminate a current 
pregnancy than the older single women. Waiting for better future reproductive con-
ditions seems to be playing a role in decisions to terminate pregnancies, especially 
for young women who may be lacking in social support. 
9.3.2  Breastfeeding and Conflict
One of the core features of mammals is the provisioning of offspring with milk. 
Breastfeeding is one of the most energetically costly aspects of maternal investment 
post-birth (Konner, 2005; Prentice et al., 1996). While contemporary breastfeeding 
patterns vary widely across cultures (Scott et al., 2001; Sellen, 2009), human infants 
evolved under circumstances where their survival would have depended on the 
nutritional and immunological value of maternal breastmilk (Ballard & Morrow, 
2013; Hinde & Milligan, 2011; Martin et al., 2016; Power & Schulkin, 2013; Volk, 
2009). Extended breastfeeding is common in most contemporary hunter-gatherer or 
non-industrialized populations (Sellen, 2009), while frequency is less common and 
durations are much shorter in industrialized countries (likely influenced by outside-­
the-­home work and the availability of breastmilk alternatives) despite frequent 
advocacy for breastfeeding (Endressen & Helsing, 1995; Obermeyer & Castle, 1996).
Because of the importance of breast milk to infant success, one might expect all 
mothers to provide as much as often as they can. However, because lactation is 
energetically costly and time-consuming, conflict can arise because of trade-offs 
between lactation/nursing and the mother’s own somatic functions, investment in 
other existing or future children, and so on. This can occur while the mother contin-
ues to breastfeed as well as during weaning (the period of cessation of breastfeed-
ing), which will be discussed with respect to weaning later in this chapter. This 
conflict can be seen at a biological and behavioral level.
One might assume that mothers would have the advantage in maternal-infant 
conflict over food and other resources once the baby is out of the womb. But the 
balance of power is not that clear cut, and both infant behavior and maternal biology 
seem to play a role. For example, a number of researchers have reported on how 
continued nursing is associated with lactational amenorrhea, which can result in 
higher infant fitness by delaying the arrival of their next sibling and the attendant 
dilution of resources (Haig, 2014). High-frequency continued nursing does this by 
suppressing the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis (Konner & 
Worthman, 1980; Vitzthum, 1994), influencing maternal hormone levels. From the 
current infant’s perspective, they benefit from longer breastfeeding. From the mater-
nal perspective, there is a trade-off as shorter breastfeeding duration can result in 
smaller infants at weaning (and possible increased infant mortality), but the next 
C. Salmon and J. Hehman

203
conception can occur sooner (Vitzthum, 1994, 2008). As a result, we would expect 
more conflict when there is a maternal advantage to an earlier next conception.
In addition, it has been suggested that maternal physiology has evolved to mod-
ify offspring behavior via components in milk influencing infant microbiota (Allen-­
Belvins et al., 2015). This conceptual model has bioactives in maternal milk directly 
influencing infant gut microbiota and neurobiology (as well as indirect infant 
microbiota impacts on developing neurobiology) so as to influence infant behavior 
(crying, nursing, other activity) and resulting mother-infant interactions. Studies 
have indicated that maternal-origin hormones ingested via milk shape growth and 
development in infants (Hinde et al., 2015) and that there are links between micro-
biota composition and infant temperament (Christian et al., 2015). While infants 
have behavioral tactics designed to elicit care and nutrition, sometimes more than 
is in mothers’ best interests to provide, that can be seen as positive (smiling) or 
negative (crying), mothers have evolved countermeasures perhaps via their milk 
components in order to shape less costly phenotypes in their infants (Allen-Blevins 
et al., 2015).
As is the case for research on parent-offspring conflict in non-humans 
(Maestripieri, 2002; Salmon & Malcolm, 2011), there are several models of beg-
ging behavior that focus on infant attempts to influence parents into providing more 
nutrients, including blackmail, scramble competition, honest signaling of need, and 
honest signals of worth. Evidence from research on human infants suggests that 
suckling and crying signal nutritional need (and perhaps also thermoregulation 
needs) and worth to the mother (Wells, 2003). These cues can act at biochemical 
and behavioral levels. The role of imprinted genes in maternal-infant conflict has 
also been examined (Haig, 2014; Moore & Haig, 1991) with regard to the impact of 
paternally or maternally imprinted genes on resource transfer from mother to off-
spring as discussed previously. Moore and Haig (1991) predicted that some genes 
can influence the amount of resources transferred from a mother to current offspring 
at the expense of future offspring (who may not share the same father). Observations 
of the effects of a chromosomal deletion of 15q11-13 provide support for this pre-
diction, in that maternal deletions are associated with Angelman syndrome while 
paternal loss is associated with Prader-Willi syndrome. The infant behaviors associ-
ated with these syndromes are discussed in the section on weaning conflict.
From the maternal perspective, lactation is a parental investment and as such, we 
would expect it to be allocated in ways that are consistent with fitness payoffs, as a 
current investment in lactation results in lower residual reproductive value for the 
mother, as well as post-partum amenorrhea (Margulis et al., 1993; Tracer, 1996). 
Tracer (2009) examined breastfeeding in terms of allocation of parental investment 
in Papua New Guinea, reporting high levels of maternal investment, and that when 
infants were fussing or crying, they were given the breast 30% of the time. However, 
in contrast to the prediction from parental investment theory that mothers should 
invest more in higher quality offspring, Tracer (2009) reported greater investment in 
offspring who were in poorer condition, perhaps because they were more likely to 
benefit from that investment than those already in good condition. Interestingly, a 
number of studies have indicated that allomaternal care reduces lactational demands 
9  Evolutionary Perspectives on Infant-Mother Conflict

204
and can reduce maternal-infant conflict due to helper at the nest effects (Kramer, 
2010; McKerracher et al., 2017; Van Noordwijk et al., 2013). McKerracher and col-
leagues report in their study of rural Guatemalan Maya villages that mothers with 
more help, breastfed for shorter periods and that later infant birth order was associ-
ated with greater breastfeeding duration. This birth order effect is consistent with 
expectations from parent-offspring conflict theory. As mothers approach meno-
pause, future reproductive opportunities decrease and mother and offspring ideal 
breastfeeding allocations converge.
9.3.3  Weaning Conflict
Weaning can be “defined as a process that begins with the introduction of nutritive 
supplemental foods and ends with the complete cessation of breastfeeding” 
(McDade, 2001, p. 10). Weaning is a major conflict point between mother and off-
spring in that the mother can end her lactational amenorrhea, increasing her likeli-
hood of an additional pregnancy, while her infant is losing breastfeeding calories 
and starting to become nutritionally independent (though in humans, children are 
nutritionally dependent on parents to provide alternative foods for an extended 
period of time). In this sense, for humans, childhood is much longer than in the 
majority of mammals, but offspring are weaned at a relatively earlier age (Kennedy, 
2005). Early weaning may have fitness benefits for mothers but longer access to 
breastmilk has infant fitness advantages, thus conflict is expected to occur over the 
timing of weaning, as there are costs and benefits to early versus late weaning. This 
maternal-infant feeding conflict can be seen in the influence of maternally and 
paternally imprinted genes (Haig, 2010a, 2014; Haig & Wharton, 2003). Maternally 
imprinted genes favor early maturation in offspring while paternally imprinted 
genes favor increased suckling. Mothers can benefit from having one infant nursing 
while another is more nutritionally independent, eating food (and receiving care) 
provided not only by the mother but by other alloparental sources, increasing mater-
nal fitness (Bereczkei & Dunbar, 1997; Hrdy, 2005; Ivey, 2000; Kennedy, 2005; 
Kramer, 2005).
There are a number of strategies that infants employ to delay weaning. Studies of 
night waking indicate that it increases in the second half of the first year of infant 
life in breastfed infants. As previously mentioned, postpartum amenorrhea has a 
significant impact on the inter-birth interval in natural fertility populations (Thapa 
et al., 1988), and more frequent and intense nursing, particularly at night, is related 
to longer periods of infertility (Heinig et al., 1994). Haig (2014) has suggested the 
maternally and paternally imprinted genes influence the use of such strategies based 
on the study of infants with Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, which were 
previously discussed in terms of in utero effects. Prader-Willi syndrome infants are 
poor sucklers who sleep a lot while Angelman syndrome infants engage in greater 
suckling and night waking (poor sleepers). This suggests that night waking is an

205
adaptive strategy on the part of infants to extend lactation amenorrhea and, as a 
result, delay the birth of sibling competitors.
Jealousy protest has been suggested as another offspring strategy to delay sibling 
competitors for maternal resources (Hart, 2015, 2016; See Hart, Chap. 12, this vol-
ume). While much of the study of jealousy as an adaptation has been concentrated 
on sexual or emotional jealousy in romantic relationships (Buss, 2017, 2018), jeal-
ousy is possible wherever conflict may arouse over investment allocation. This may 
be especially relevant for infants who are dependent on their mothers for nutrition 
and protection. Studies indicate that infants as young as 5–6 months show distress 
when their mother is positively interacting with another infant (Hart & Carrington, 
2002; Hart et  al., 2004) and by 10–12  months display distress and caregiving-­
directed bids for attention (Hart & Behrens, 2013). These behaviors characterize the 
outward manifestation of jealousy protest, “a constellation of caregiver-directed 
protests and attention-getting behaviors for protecting exclusive access to a care-
giver” (Hart, 2016, p. 1). The characteristic onset around 9 months of age and peak 
around 20 months suggests that a problem infants needed to solve ancestrally was 
premature weaning due to the birth of another sibling and that jealousy protest 
evolved to defend against it. However, not all infants display indicators of jealousy 
protest around weaning, and future research should focus on what factors increase 
or decrease the likelihood of the use of jealousy protest by infants across cultures.
Because there are costs and benefits to exclusive breastfeeding, especially over 
the extended time, it is useful to consider the ecological conditions that may pro-
mote or delay the timing of weaning as well as who may be having more influence 
over the timing, mother or offspring. In general, it is in the best interests of mother 
and offspring to be sensitive to each other’s needs and to modify their own behavior 
and demands accordingly so as to reduce the net costs of conflict. Although a great 
deal of attention has focused on the benefits of breastfeeding to child health, as well 
as the benefits of longer inter-birth intervals, somewhat less attention has captured 
the several ways breastfeeding imposes costs. We have already mentioned the delay 
in future conception caused by lactational amenorrhea, but there are also costs in 
terms of maternal nutritional depletion, as well as constraints of maternal activity, 
such as reducing foraging efficiency (McDade, 2001; Hawkes, 1996; Hurtado, 
et al., 1992). These costs and benefits vary across time. The relative benefits of 
breast milk decline over time for infants as consumption of solid foods increases as 
well as overall caloric requirements to support growth and development 
(Grammatikaki & Huybrechts, 2016; Koutras & Vigorita, 1989; Uauy & De 
Andraca, 1995); and they also vary by ecological factors such as pathogen exposure, 
maternal workload/subsistence type, availability of supplemental food, and allopa-
rental support (Fouts et al., 2012; Hurtado et al., 1992; Konner, 2005; Morrow et al., 
2005; Vitzthum, 1994).
A wide range of studies has looked at weaning conflict and the timing of weaning 
across a variety of cultures, in particular in non-western (in many cases not using 
modern contraception) populations. For example, Fouts and colleagues (Fouts, 
2004; Fouts et al., 2005, 2012) have examined the contexts surrounding weaning 
among farmers and foragers in Central Africa. Consistent with Konner’s (2005) 
9  Evolutionary Perspectives on Infant-Mother Conflict

206
assessment that foragers breastfeed longer than farmers, which is associated with 
longer interbirth intervals, Ngandu and Bofi farmers weaned offspring earlier than 
Aka and Bofi foragers. This highlights the role of subsistence type and attendant 
culture on weaning practices. Among the foragers, breastfeeding was also at more 
frequent intervals, the bouts were of shorter duration (Fouts et al., 2012), and the 
infants displayed less distress when weaning occurred. Any maternal-infant wean-
ing conflict seemed ameliorated, at least in terms of obvious signs, in the foragers 
compared to the farmers. A study focusing specifically on the timing of weaning in 
Dominica reported that father absence was associated with early weaning but that 
the availability of alloparental care and household wealth was negatively associated 
with the age of weaning, and that the number of dependent children in the house-
hold was positively associated with the timing of weaning (Quinlan et al., 2003). 
These results emphasize the importance not only of focal offspring need but also the 
opportunity costs of prolonged nursing as well as the nature of reciprocal female 
labor and the value of paternal investment while nursing.
9.4  Conclusions
The research discussed in this chapter highlights the cooperation and conflict inher-
ent in the maternal-infant relationship. Prenatal conflict demonstrates the evolution-
ary arms race between mother and fetus, in that the more elaborated the mechanisms 
for fetal exploitation, the more evolved the maternal adaptations for downregulation 
of response to fetal actions. This cooperative interplay of conflict between mothers 
and fetuses helps ensure successful outcomes for both mother and infant. This coop-
erative interplay continues postnatally with regard to nutrition and other forms of 
investment (bonding, attention, etc.). Even weaning, which has typically only been 
viewed as a zone of conflict, demonstrates cooperation and is influenced by ecologi-
cal and cultural conditions.
Future research is needed to resolve a number of inconsistent findings. For exam-
ple, some studies have found pregnancy sickness to be associated with elevated 
hCG levels, whereas others have found no associations. While descriptive work 
with mixed findings has been done, more research into the mechanisms underlying 
these outcomes is needed to clarify their functional nature. Research into genomic 
imprinting and fetal microchimerism has been limited in humans, yielding evidence 
suggesting both positive and negative effects on maternal health. Therefore, more 
human research in this area is needed to understand the long-term effects of these 
conflicts.

Niche Construction in Hunter-Gatherer 
Infancy: Growth and Health Trade-Offs 
Inform Social Agency

10.1  Introduction
One of the most challenging tasks for evolutionary research on human development 
is synthesizing the span of ecological processes responsible for its nature. New data 
and theory bring us closer to the consilience that ontogenetic explanations require, 
but often have equivocal relevance to the environments in which we evolved. 
Hunter-gatherers present an irreplaceable ecological venue to probe development in 
a more proximate niche to our evolutionary past (Blurton Jones, 1993; Hewlett & 
Lamb, 2005). Similarly, infancy is the most proximate period of development to that 
of other primates, as human postnatal altriciality, rapid brain growth, and early 
weaning relative to apes present a premature and energetically imperiled infant to 
the world (Hochberg & Albertsson-Wikland, 2008). Together, this developmental 
crucible of evolution is linked with adaptive features of human intelligence, parental 
pair-bonding and division of labor, central place foraging, food sharing, multiple 
dependency, cooperative reproduction,1 and other biological and social 
1 We use the term “cooperative reproduction” to describe the fundamental dependence of human 
reproductive success on the time and energetic contributions of other-than-parents to successfully 
rear young. It aligns with the interspecific construct of “cooperative breeding,” but includes 
the broader and extended cooperative investments (e.g., food sharing, socialization, skills transfer) 
key to human developmental success. We prefer it, too, for interdisciplinary relevance, as the term 
breeding is used to describe artificial selection methods in other fields (e.g., genetics, neurosci-

characteristics (Bjorklund, 2018; Hrdy & Burkart, Chapter 8, this volume; Kaplan 
et al., 2000; Konner, 2010).
In this chapter, we explore how ecological and somatic trade-offs within hunter-­
gatherer development inform the special social nature of human infancy. Like many 
of our colleagues studying hunter-gatherers, our research among Efe (pygmy) for-
agers of the northeastern Congo Basin (Democratic Republic of the Congo) finds 
that infants are highly active agents who acquire resources by increasingly sophisti-
cated cooperative means (Morelli et al., 2014, 2019). We have identified resource 
and psychosocial implications of cooperative reproduction for infants as coopera-
tive development, whereby human ontogeny expects the dynamic and multidimen-
sional inputs of others (than mother) that prime developmental experience of 
discernment, synchrony, trust, and helping as precursors to a life dependent on shar-
ing (Gurven et al., 2012).
Konner’s (2005) review of hunter-gatherer childhood research illustrates regu-
larities in developmental experience over the first 2 years of life: infants nurse fre-
quently, their signals of distress are responded to quickly, and they experience 
extensive physical contact and proximity to others. Who cares for young and when, 
however, varies widely with local ecology, subsistence activities, and culture. 
Prominent themes of forager research include the explanatory role of infant allocare 
in human life history (e.g., Helfrecht et al., 2020; Ivey, 2000); lactation and weaning 
(e.g., Konner & Worthman, 1980; Meehan & Roulette, 2013); foodsharing (e.g., 
Morelli et al., 2019; Fouts & Brookshire, 2009); prosociality and attachment (e.g., 
Barlow, 2013; Crittenden & Marlowe, 2013); play and exploration (e.g., Kamei, 
2005; Salali et al., 2019); and language and cultural acquisition (e.g., Gallois et al., 
2018, Hewlett & Roulette, 2016).
This rich social view of forager infancy illustrates the ecological and biological 
substrates in which infancy evolved, and suggests that new insights can be gained 
from a closer view of intra-developmental processes and their trade-offs. 
Conceptualizing trade-offs in development moves us beyond constraint and risk 
models to probe the time and energetic costs and benefits of alternate pathways, and 
the co-acting nature of diverse processes that inform developmental adaptations 
(e.g., Bogin et al., 2007; Ellis & Del Giudice, 2019). Growth and mortality are per-
haps the most reported features of forager infant biology (e.g., McDowell & Volk, 
Chapter 5, this volume; Ramirez Rozzi et al., 2015; Urlacher et al., 2015; Volk & 
Atkinson, 2013). Less frequent, but highly valuable, is research on forager infant 
physiological, motor, and neurobehavioral development (e.g., Kaplan & Dove, 
1987; Takada, 2005; Tronick & Winn, 1992).
Elsewhere, evolutionary insights have been employed to examine infant develop-
mental consequences of maternal energetic, stress, and immune transfers (e.g., Ellis 
& Del Giudice, 2019; Kramer & Veile, 2018; McDade et al., 2019; Sear & Mace, 
2008). This progress frames infancy as a variable physiological, neuropsychologi-
cal, and behavioral experience responsive to environmental features and social 
ence, and medicine). In addition, a primary life history trade-off is described as between “growth 
and reproduction,” not “growth and breeding.”

transfers to mothers and infants. Canalization protects this fragile period, but it also 
scaffolds phenotypic plasticity to better match and influence ecological and cultural 
experience in the developmental niche (Bjorklund, 2018; Chisholm, 2017).
Today, a new generation of “-omic” and other assay data offers new perspectives 
on forager infancy (e.g., Han et al., 2016; Meehan et al., 2018), although the integra-
tion of genetic, epigenetic, microbiome, and other -omic data with ecological and 
health evidence is still cautiously mapped territory under the most favorable cir-
cumstances (Subramanian et al., 2020). In spite of challenges, including the few 
foragers from which measures can be obtained, the intense environmental and social 
experience of forager infancy warrants explorations in this direction. These insights 
have special value to the expanding fields of evolutionary medicine and evolution-
ary developmental ecology, where they can deepen our understanding of neurobe-
havioral plasticity and social agency as biological and health processes (Kuzawa, 
2012; Trevathan & Rosenberg, 2016).
The first quantitative descriptions of Efe infancy probed the biosocial intersec-
tion of this challenge. Tronick et al. (1987) hypothesized that Efe allonursing in the 
first few months of life enhances immune and regulatory development via shared 
antibodies and fluids, as well as nutrients. Efe also adjusted allocare to accommo-
date lower birth weight and fussing infants suggesting strategies to manage early 
physiological and neurobehavioral processes. These and other care patterns demon-
strate sensitive and shared investments in infant health and growth, with infants over 
time playing an increasing role in soliciting the care they receive (Morelli et al., 
2014, 2019). Their activity serves them well as they mature beyond the energetic 
threshold of lactation in the first year, when they need additional food from others 
(Kuzawa et al., 2014).
We return our attention to early characterizations of Efe infancy that weave 
together biology, cooperation, and infant sociality as interdependent features of evo-
lutionary, ecological, and cultural experience. Here, we (1) briefly describe theoreti-
cal constructs framing the multileveled, interactive systems view of processes in Efe 
infancy; (2) describe ecological resources and risks in the Efe niche as prevalent 
opportunities and pressures on infants and others; (3) explore emerging phyloge-
netic, genomic, and epigenetic data regarding adaptive variation of Congo Basin 
hunter-gatherer (CBHG) biology; (4) consider evidence of Efe growth, health, and 
life history trade-offs; and (5) discuss how these insights inform Efe care, attach-
ment, and social agency.
It is highly unusual to have this opportunity: few populations have as long and 
discreet an endemic evolutionary and ecological history as do African indigenous 
hunter-gatherers, such as the Efe, Aka, !Kung, and Hadza. This facilitates an 
extended view of biological canalization and plasticity and the mapping of social 
development to both. Opportunities to fill gaps in hunter-gatherer data are limited 
by the very few who remain mobile as coherent residential units dependent on hunt-
ing and gathering, even while attaining food by horticulture, trade, and other means 
(Marlowe, 2005).

10.2  Organizing Constructs in Evolution, Ecology, 
and Development
It is not surprising that Niko Tinbergen (1963) studied ontogeny, compelling the 
integrative explanatory framework of behavior that remains so productive today. 
Human development by necessity favors an ambitious causal scope that spans 
dynamic evolutionary, adaptive, proximate, and ontogenetic processes, in addition 
to cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary views (Amir & McAuliffe, 2020; Bjorklund 
& Ellis, 2014). In that spirit, but scaled, we bring together diverse perspectives and 
data to reconstruct, in part, the richly complex developmental niche of Efe infancy. 
Human infants are vulnerable and demanding, and hunter-gatherer environments 
make these risks substantially more challenging (Helfrecht et al., 2020). How do 
forager adaptations to ecological and social variation and uncertainty inform the 
capacity of human infants and their caregivers to mitigate harm and to thrive? We 
briefly describe central constructs that guide this review, and in service of space, 
refer the reader to detailed descriptions of theory elsewhere, including other chap-
ters in this volume.
10.2.1  Developmental Niche Construction (DNC)
Niche construction (NC) describes evolutionary ecological feedback processes of 
phenotype-environmental interactions, whereby organisms directly and indirectly 
influence the parameters of their own environmental experience, and therefore, the 
subsequent ecological conditions they encounter (Laland et al., 2016; Odling-Smee, 
1995). For example, many animals construct special habitats to protect young, 
thereby generating new conditions to which offspring must adapt (Clutton-Brock, 
1991). These feedback systems between individual and habitat interact as adaptive 
processes on proximate to evolutionary scales, and within and across systems, for 
example, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and cultural. If stable over 
extended time, the shifted phenotype may become embedded in the genome, further 
influencing the coevolution of traits, and direction and strength of selective pro-
cesses (Clark et al., 2010). Nature is stochastic, yet niche feedbacks help to stabilize 
an inherently dynamic process, increasing the predictability and efficiency of envi-
ronmental experience, and channel phenotypic plasticity, the organism’s adaptive 
range (Bruijning et al., 2020).
Developmental niche construction (DNC) is special form of NC during ontog-
eny. It describes ecological feedbacks inherent in developmental processes that bias 
ontogenetic trajectories, stabilizing outcomes (e.g., maturation, timing, and struc-
ture of traits), and response variability described as developmental plasticity, or 
ontogenetically mediated phenotypic plasticity (West-Eberhard, 2003). These mul-
tisystem interactive processes increase the predictability and efficiency of resource 
and risk adaptations during the unique period of growth and development by 
P. Ivey Henry and G. A. Morelli

217
producing a set of reaction norms that are environmentally contingent (Matthey 
Doret et al., 2020). DNC characterizes adaptation without inferring trait selection at 
an evolutionary scale, although they may be related (Stotz, 2017), as research here 
suggests.
Somatic and extrasomatic feedback processes of DNC enable human young to 
manage the variable experience of mother and others’ time and energetic allocations 
as physiological and psychosocial cues of resource availability and risk (Ellis & Del 
Giudice, 2019; Kramer & Veile, 2018). And, as infants and children grow, they face 
a diverse and changing set of problems to solve to secure adequate food and care, 
including the competitive and cooperative experience of each other (Gurven & 
Walker, 2005; Hart, 2015; Chapter 15, this volume; Kramer et al., 2016). We argue 
that DNC processes are evident in both the evolutionary and ecological synchrony 
of Efe infant growth and physiology to their energetic and health environment, and 
the synchronization of biobehavioral processes between infant and caregivers that 
facilitates predictability and security in Efe relationships as adaptations to resource 
and risk uncertainty.
10.2.2  Human Developmental Ecology (HDE)
Human development ecology (HDE) is the complementary examination of variation 
in processes and outcomes as they play out in a specific niche. Most critically, it 
heeds empirical demands to attend to local environment and history, and context-­
specific biological and behavioral trade-offs in the complex, integrated, and self-­
generating processes of development (Bjorklund & Ellis, 2014; Gurven, 2018). For 
example, it extricates the construct of child resilience from conventional trait and 
impairment models by probing alternative and adaptive developmental pathways 
(Ellis et al., 2017; Macrì, 2013). As such, resilience is conceptualized not only as an 
individual process, but a social one in a specific niche of affordances and constraints 
(Júnior et al., 2015). DNC and HDE stimulate questions of multiple processes at 
play in any outcome of interest, and facilitate the integration of alternative theories 
to explain variation within it.
10.2.3  Problems and Methods in Hunter-Gatherer 
Niche Reconstruction
Hunter-gatherer researchers have been careful to frame measures and interpreta-
tions of infant development in ways they see as salient to contexts they observe. 
They are often reluctant to generalize findings, precisely because the ecological 
variation and richness of forager experience is so entangled in the details and 
dynamics of their  biology and behavior. This risks a fragmented view, but 
10  Niche Construction in Hunter-Gatherer Infancy: Growth and Health Trade-Offs…

218
underscores the diversity of infant experience less appreciated from a canonical 
frame. The situation is hardly hopeless; researchers are keen to summarize and 
compare data (e.g., Hewlett, 1991; Konner, 2005), and one of the most successful 
approaches has been to narrow the ecological lens by comparing forager develop-
ment to neighboring groups, often horticulturalists, who share a broader habitat 
(e.g., Kramer & Greaves, 2007; Meehan, 2009; Morelli et al., 2019).
The challenge of aligning disparate data informing ecological processes in 
hunter-gatherer development is complicated by the very few forager groups from 
which new data can be collected, the fragmented scope of historic and emerging 
data, and many difficulties of hunter-gatherer fieldwork. For the Efe, a decade of 
war and insurgency still prohibit the safety to collect data (Wilkie, 2005). These 
problems require casting a wider net to reconstruct the forager infant niche. Here, 
we review diverse data available informing Efe development, giving primacy to the 
northeastern Ituri Efe reported in our prior studies. We also include research on 
nearby Andiri Efe and Wamba Mbuti whose clans frequently intermarry with them, 
contiguous Mbuti and Asua/Sua in the Ituri forest, other eastern CBHGs (Batwa), 
and western CBHGs as appropriate. Diverse data sources present a challenge to the 
usual business of comparative validity that we recognize and forewarn. It also pres-
ents an opportunity to bring as much of the story of Efe infant development together, 
as a quantitative-driven historian or ethnographer might do (Kraft et  al., 2020), 
where the merits of each can be considered more specifically. Especially, it allows 
us to see the outlines of the Efe evolutionary setting and infant developmental niche.
10.3  The Ecological Niche of Efe 
Hunter-Gatherer Development
The Efe are indigenous (pygmy) bow hunters whose population has been well 
described in the northeastern Ituri (Bailey & DeVore, 1989; Bailey & Peacock, 
1988, Ellison et al., 1986), and adjacent south (Andiri) (Terashima, 1983; Terashima 
et al., 1988). We refer readers to these and other research for details on the environ-
mental, demographic, economic, and reproductive lives of Efe, and here describe 
features of local ecology and adaptation that proximately shape development.
Efe reside in groups of about 15–30 people, but camps can vary widely in com-
position with each move of every 4–6 weeks. This shuffling of the infant’s social 
world is in response to rhythms of climate and forest resources, demography (e.g., 
mortality, marriage, fostering, and migration), and intermittent access to neighbor-
ing Lese farmer cultivans by clearing gardens and harvesting rice (January) and 
peanuts (June). As such, Efe infants are exposed to the variable presence and rou-
tines of others, along with changes in residence often from one month to another 
(Morelli et al., 2014).

Over the last decades, infrastructure deterioration in the region reduced the only 
road to a footpath by the early 1990s (Wilkie & Morelli, 1997). With poor market 
access, Lese gardens retracted to subsistence levels, greatly diminishing Efe’ access 
to labor and farmed carbohydrates. In 1988–89, only 1% of observations of 1-year-
olds, who still nurse frequently, were located in gardens or villages. In spite of 
constraints on carbohydrate and fat intake, Efe consume a diverse diet high in pro-
tein, fruit, and honey, and with the exception of anemia in reproductive-age women, 
neither adults nor children show signs of nutrient deficiencies (Dietz et al., 1989). 
Independent of body size, the average daily calorie intake of Efe falls well within 
forager variation, and higher than the San, Hiwi, Onge, Anbarra, and Mbuti net-­
hunters (Jenike, 2001). Unlike many CBHGs, rather than plant gardens themselves, 
northeastern Efe have responded to nutritional uncertainty by increasing the extrac-
tion of wild yams and other tubers, and hunting and trade of bushmeat for scarce 
cultigens (Wilkie & Morelli, 1997).
Conditions that have weakened Efe’ access to horticultural foods present an 
opportunity to think more broadly about CBHG ecology in the past (e.g., Ichikawa, 
2012). The Ituri is the most diverse rainforest in Africa, but resources are often tem-
porally and spatially unpredictable in distribution. Ethnobotany inventories of 
Andiri Efe and Mbuti reported over 100 species of forest plants used (Ichikawa, 
1999; Terashima et al., 1988), and in the northwestern Congo Basin, over 88 species 
of 61 genera and 43 families of wild edible plants were identified by the Baka 
(Billong Fils et al. 2020). In the heavy rainy season of 1989, many Efe complained 
of scarcity, but an old woman proudly displayed to the author (PIH) her basket brim-
ming with an array of fruits, nuts, tubers, crustaceans, and fish, saying “the young 
women have forgotten where to find all the food.” Securing food in the distant past 
required higher information and travel demands for women.
Efe and other CBHGs share much in common regarding their forest and social 
environments, along with many features of an extensive and sensitive infant allocare 
system. But not all. For example, Efe infants experience much lower direct paternal 
care (Hewlett, 1991; Tronick et  al., 1992) and a briefer period of allonursing 
(Hewlett & Winn, 2014, Ivey Henry et al., 2014). Additionally, economic differ-
ences influence CBHG’s access to food and care in important ways. Efe archers 
achieve higher hunting returns than Mbuti net-hunters overall, but experience much 
greater variation in day-to-day intake (Wilkie & Curran, 1991). The uncertain nature 
of bow-and-arrow hunts, prescribed butchering and distribution, rather than the 
pooling and equalization of net returns, and sharper sexual division of labor (Efe 
women and children rarely participate in hunts) reflect a more unpredictable energy 
budget for Efe archers than CBHG net-hunters (Bailey, 1991a; Meehan, 2009). 
Women’s foraging and fishing returns are also variable and narrowly shared (Bailey 
& Peacock, 1988). Few Efe in the region, and no subject families in our research, 
planted gardens, and thus mothers could not readily buffer their own and their chil-
dren’s energetic variation.

10.3.1  A Phylogenetic View: Reconstructing the Efe 
Evolutionary Niche
Looking up through a porthole in the canopy, it may be that as Efe infants grow, they 
see the same complexly structured forest view as their ancestors in millennia past. 
Three rock shelters in the Efe region, and still used by them, suggest that the Ituri 
has long been occupied as Pleistocene and Holocene forests expanded and con-
tracted, producing an archipelago of forests with savanna and woodland corridors 
between (Mercader et al., 2001). Such findings among CBHGs, together with early 
Homo occupation of Asian rainforests, reframe these habitats as central to the 
human story (Oslisly et al., 2013; Wedage et al., 2019).
Over the last decade, genomic studies have begun to lift the veil on the prehistory 
of CBHGs. Pygmies were long considered homogenous remnants of a continuous 
population, but genetically, geographically, and culturally they are diverse 
(Anagnostou et  al., 2013; Bahuchet, 2012). An ancestral population of central 
African hunter-gatherers diverged from the shared !Kung line 48–60 kya, and split 
again around 30–20 kya (coincident with the last glacial maximum) into two dis-
tinct clusters – eastern (e.g., Efe, Mbuti, Asua, Sua, and Batwa) and western (e.g., 
Aka, Baka, and Biaka), with little subsequent exchange between them. CBHGs 
extended separation, and convergent adaptions are evident in genetic, epigenetic, 
and phenotypic patterns between the two groups; with Efe distinct in the lowest 
level of admixture with horticultural neighbors (Fagny et al., 2015; Perry et al., 
2014). The Efe also retain the use of ancestral bow-and-arrow technology and have 
minimal access to market economies (Bailey & DeVore, 1989). Like other CBHGs, 
their indigenous association with the forest raises unique questions concerning plas-
ticity in human growth and development (Migliano et al., 2013).
10.3.2  An Adaptive View: Genetic and Epigenetic Signals 
of CBHG Development
Primary interest in CBHGs has long focused on the question of small body size. 
Adaptive hypotheses are typically framed in terms of adult traits and functioning 
associated with mobility (Jang et al., 2019), thermoregulatory advantages (Cavalli-­
Sforza, 1986), low food supply (Bailey et al., 1989), pathogen costs (Perry et al., 
2014), and a life history pattern associated with high mortality (Migliano et al., 
2007). But, small body size during development presents a very different set of 
vulnerabilities than for adults, requiring a closer view of the infant niche and diverse 
developmental systems influenced in tandem with ecological experience. Genetic 
enrichment in eastern CBHGs include sites related to sensory perception (e.g., 
olfactory, taste, and myopia), neurodevelopment (e.g., neurogenesis, prefrontal cor-
tex), morphological (e.g., adiposity, skeletal density, cardiovascular, muscle, and 
reproductive), and immune functions (e.g., antiviral signaling pathways, 
P. Ivey Henry and G. A. Morelli

221
pathogen-­specific responses) (Harrison et al., 2019; Lopez et al., 2019; Perry et al., 
2014). These point to multiple adaptive systems at play in habitat responses over 
evolutionary time.
New insights are also emerging from epigenetic analyses informing CBHG’s 
adaptations. Fagny et  al. (2015) found that developmental processes dominate 
CBHG DNA methylation enrichment profiles, including gene sites associated with 
brain and neural development, growth factor binding, morphogenesis, locomotion, 
and a broad set of immune processes. Many sites are associated with embryogenesis 
and fetal development, but the timing of other signals remain unclear. Broad post-
natal neural and physiological exposures, and later reproductive shifts underscore 
the extended importance of many (Gao et al., 2017; Kuzawa et al., 2010). (See 
Fig. 10.1 for genetic, epigenetic, and observed evidence reported in this chapter).
We do not speculate on specific associations between CBHG variants and out-
comes in Efe development; phenotypic interpretations remain conditional on addi-
tional research on pathways and plasticity involved (Hoban et al., 2016). But, salient 
traces of ecological variation are evident in these patterns, offering clues of evolu-
tionary to proximate developmental adaptation.
10.4  Developmental Plasticity and Somatic Capital – 
Forager Infancy in an Evolutionary Ecological Niche
Infancy is a transformative period of the most rapid postnatal growth (Locke & 
Bogin, Chapter 6, this volume; Bogin, 1999) and the period of strongest selection 
pressure in humans (Jones, 2009; Volk & Atkinson, 2013). In addition to evidence 
above, Efe infancy exhibits a biophysiological tuning of size and growth as features 
of adaptive biology. The Efe have the lowest average adult stature of any population 
(mean 143  cm males, 136  cm females), in a pattern evidenced from birth. Efe 
infants’ average weight is 2.4 to 2.6 kg at birth, that is, a weight near or below the 
5th percentile of NCHS standards and considered low birth weight (LBW) (Bailey, 
1991b; Tronick & Winn, 1992).2 Mbuti infants in the Ngayu region of the eastern 
Ituri weighed 2.6 kg at birth (n = 40) (Vincent et al., 1962), and were among 29 
other populations with average birth weights below 3.0 kg in a global survey of 
neonates from 1945–1965. Only newborns among the Lumi of New Guinea were 
similar or smaller (mean = 2.4 kg) (Meredith, 1970).
Many LBW infants experience a period of rapid “catch-up growth” in the first 
year of life (Kuzawa et al., 2010); however, longitudinal measures of Efe from birth 
to 5  years demonstrate an increasingly negative rate of growth (i.e., increasing 
z-scores) compared to Lese and NCHS standards (Bailey, 1991b). Hunter-gatherers, 
2 We report Efe growth comparisons according to the original analyses of respective authors who 
use NCHS (CDC) standards. Both NCHS and current WHO standards for low birth weight are 
2.5 kg. Our discussion of postnatal growth trends relies on comparisons to neighboring farmers 
rather than external standards alone.

222
including those with higher birth weights, generally converge on slower rates of 
growth than observed in other populations (Walker et al., 2006), and the small adult 
size of !Kung and Hadza leaves open the hypothesis that small size represents an 
ancestral phenotype (Howell, 2010; Little, 2020). In addition to this pattern, smaller 
body phenotypes than the hunter-gather average have emerged independently in a 
number of tropical forest peoples, with adaptive hypotheses similarly aligned to 
those described for CBHGs above (Amorim et al., 2015; Migliano et al., 2013).

223
Developmental plasticity in infant size and growth in the hunter-gatherer niche is 
likely to differ from LBW and slow growth among impoverished agricultural 
groups, where macro- and micronutrient scarcity and poor maternal health result in 
poor fetal growth (e.g., Rickard et al. 2012). In resource abundant settings, meta-­
analyses demonstrate that LBW in infants born ≥37 weeks gestation was not associ-
ated with childhood hypertension, obesity, cognitive impairment, or psychiatric 
diagnoses as predicted by a simple rendering of the developmental health constraint 
hypothesis (Malin et al., 2015). In these settings, where the most intensive research 
has been conducted, adverse LBW-associated outcomes involve additional signals 
of interuterine growth restriction (IUGR) (e.g., early gestation, very low birth 
weight [VLBW]) and compounded risks of economic, psychosocial, and environ-
mental adversity (Aizer & Currie, 2014, Gage et al., 2010). Some etiological pro-
cesses and risks (food insecurity, social, and immune stress), though, may be shared 
(Akombi et al., 2017; Wells, 2019).
10.4.1  Trade-Offs in Growth and Health: The Hungry 
Immune System
Coupled maternal and offspring energetic effects should be especially evident in 
high pathogen environments (McDade et al., 2019), and the endocrinological resis-
tance to growth in CBHGs (Becker et al., 2013) implies serious disadvantages of 
rapid growth or larger size. Forager mothers must manage energetic and immune 
challenges through subsequent pregnancies, while enhancing the energy available 
for her offspring’s own investments in growth and defense (Gurven & Walker, 2005; 
McDade et al., 2019). Efe and other hunter-gatherer infants are at special risk in the 
pathogen-rich niche of tropical forests. Immune activation can disrupt child growth 
across even the short span of a few months (McDade et al., 2008), and the excep-
tional diversity of forest pathogens implies higher costs of managing complex trade-­
offs within the maturing immune system (e.g., allocations to innate versus acquired, 
sensitivity versus specificity, and tolerance versus elimination responses) (McDade 
et al., 2016).
Infections are most costly to the young, and an early survey of Ituri Mbuti net-­
hunters found that children under 15 years of age had a higher prevalence of para-
sites than did adolescents or adults (Mann et  al., 1962). Yet, compared to Lese 
farmers, Efe children aged 2–18 years experienced a lower frequency of every dis-
ease and symptom assessed, including anemia, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, diar-
rhea, cough, and chills/fever, although differences did not reach significance (Dietz 
et al., 1989). Efe children spend most of their time in the forest setting, suggesting 
greater pathogen exposure (Mann et al., 1962). But, although they are smaller, and 
grow more slowly than Lese at every age, immune allocations and enrichment 
appear to buttress the forager child’s health. Efe infants have other tools in the tool-
box, as well.

224
10.4.2  Trade-Offs Within Growth: A Different 
Investment in Size
An important context of Efe’ adaptation to immune and other energetic threats is 
suggested by a different measure of infant size – Ponderal Index (PI = kg/cm3). 
Mean Efe PI at birth of 2.93 places them in the 90th percentile (Tronick & Winn, 
1992). Thus, relative to size, Efe neonates are heavy, recasting their LBW as an 
adaptive feature of developmental biology (e.g., Hochberg & Albertsson-Wikland, 
2008). Maternal investment in fetal adipose tissue is associated with environmental 
disease risks (Kuzawa, 1998), and in a country-level comparison, Thomas et al. 
(2004) found that birth weight was positively related to the prevalence of parasitic 
disease. Efe birth weight runs counter to this trend, but fetal adiposity suggests such 
buffering. The Efe infant mortality rate of 14–20% (Bailey, unpublished data; Ivey, 
2000) is below the hunter-gatherer mean of 26.8% (n  =  18) (Volk & Atkinson, 
2013). LBW alone poorly captures ecological processes in infant growth. Rather 
than a deficit, Efe trade-off responses suggest resilience.
Infant fat is critical for expensive postnatal growth of the brain, and Efe biology 
may specialize in this protective evolutionary feature. Efe head circumference (a 
metric of brain growth) and weight for height (an indicator of fatness and nutrition 
status) remained within standards through infancy and childhood (Dietz et  al., 
1989). Even as infant fatness mediates the tight somatic trade-offs of neural devel-
opment, health, and skeletal growth, Efe experience a comparative slowing of 
growth such that most of the relative height difference between Efe and other popu-
lations is accounted for by 5 years of age (Bailey, 1991b). This period aligns with 
the high glucose demands of the growing brain, which increase 2.5 times from birth 
to 4 years of age (Kuzawa et al., 2014). Linear growth slows precipitously, but as 
genetic and epigenetic enrichments suggest, other developmental systems are fully 
at play. And, the protective relevance of fetal adiposity may extend well beyond 
infancy, enhancing resilience to energetic demands in the reproductive years 
(Jasienska et al., 2006).
10.4.3  Life History Trade-Offs of Small Size and Slow Growth
Small size, fast growth, and early reproduction has been proposed as a mortality-­
associated life history pattern for CBHGs (Migliano et al., 2007; Ramirez Rozzi 
et al., 2015). However, the Efe average 15.5 years at menarche, 19+ years age at first 
birth (Bailey, unpublished data), and interbirth interval of 3.2 years (Ellison et al., 
1986; Ivey Henry, unpublished data) all align with a slower growth-later reproduc-
tive pattern. Efe are consistent with Aka birth spacing (mean 3.5 years) (Hewlett, 
1991), and analyses of Gawlik and Hochberg (2012) showing longer interbirth 
intervals associated with smaller body size among foragers and other small-scale 
societies. As with Efe development, genetic signals of reproductive enrichment may 
be protective, rather than accelerate these systems. For example, unlike the Lese, 
P. Ivey Henry and G. A. Morelli

225
Efe exhibit fewer signs of iodine deficiency, which is associated with adverse devel-
opmental (e.g., congenital malformations, cognitive deficits) and reproductive (e.g., 
anovulation, fetal loss) outcomes (Dietz et al., 1989; Dormitzer et al., 1989).
Maternal constraints on Efe reproduction and infant care are suggested by lacta-
tion patterns, a critical energetic transfer from hunter-gatherer mothers to growing 
young (Sellen, 2007). In spite of extended and intensive assistance in infant care, 
Efe do not allonurse beyond the first months of life (Ivey Henry et al., 2014). Nor 
do they have consistent access to cultivans and fats to speed the weaning process 
(see Meehan & Roulette, 2013). They do benefit greatly by a flexible allocare sys-
tem that lessens maternal work conflicts with nursing (Ivey, 2000), with increasing 
food sharing by others as infants grow (Morelli et al., 2019). The substantial expense 
of Efe young, however, extends well beyond weaning. Like other CBHGs, Efe chil-
dren face poor prospects of meaningful returns of forest foods well into their second 
decade (Hagino & Yamauchi, 2016). But, unlike juvenile CBHG net-hunters, Efe 
children can provide little in the way of direct assistance to archers in the hunt. Their 
primary contribution to parental provisioning is infant care (Ivey Henry et al., 2005). 
Similar to traditional !Kung, unpredictable food returns, high maternal travel 
demands, and low provisioning capacity of young are a substantial constraint on 
maternal condition, favoring small size and slow growth independent of rainforest 
environments (e.g., Blurton Jones et al., 1994; Howell, 2010).
Few hunter-gatherer infants survive their mother’s loss (Trevathan & Rosenberg, 
2016), and childbirth is a risk to all hunter-gatherer mothers. Births recorded among 
neighboring Asua Mbuti in the Ituri from 1956 to 1959 found no significant differ-
ences in the ratio of infant size at birth to maternal size, or infant or perinatal mortal-
ity between pygmy and Bantu mothers. Mbuti births, however, experienced a 
significantly lower rate of dystocia (1% versus Bantu 12%), suggesting some advan-
tage to mothers and infants of small size at parturition (Vincent et al., 1962). No 
data exist on Efe or other forager gestational age at birth, but would be advanta-
geous to further understand hunter-gatherer plasticity in early development (e.g., 
Williams & Drake, 2019). These comparisons of Efe infant and maternal health 
suggest fewer costs to small size than expected.
10.4.4  How Can a Small Hunter-Gatherer Infant Compete?
A LBW, fat, slow-growing child is still small, and at great risk if they cannot garner 
attention required from energetically stressed mothers and others to survive, and to 
respond adaptively to the variable natural and cultural environments in which they 
find themselves. How well infant neurobiological systems are organized is impor-
tant to their ability to secure resources (Bell et al., 2008). Often, LBW infants rate 
poorly on measures of neurobehavioral competency and coordination, but this is not 
evident in Efe infancy. Over the first 2 weeks of life, using the Neonatal Behavioral 
Assessment Scale (NBAS), Tronick and Winn (1992) noted:
10  Niche Construction in Hunter-Gatherer Infancy: Growth and Health Trade-Offs…

226
Efe infants stilled and focused on visual and auditory stimuli. They tracked and followed 
these stimuli, moving their eyes and head in smooth arcs. Efe infants managed extended 
periods of well-modulated alertness and in general experienced few dramatic changes in 
state. When they did become upset or fussy, they were easily quieted, sometimes with the 
assistance of the examiner, but often they quieted themselves. Their motor tone was in the 
normal range and for the most part unremarkable, both when lying alone and when handled. 
They had few startles, and tremulousness was only observed during the more stressful seg-
ments of the examination. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVAs) on each of 
the cluster scores failed to uncover changes in performance on any of the cluster scores over 
time (all F < 1.0, p > .5). (p. 442)
Efe infants’ neurobehavioral organization is comparable to healthy average weight 
Caucasian samples, with none of the weak indicators found in symmetrical growth-­
restricted full-term infants of similar birth weights. And, rather than more irritable 
and reactive, they are calmer and more easily settled than these samples. Efe new-
borns also differ from the NBAS performance of Gusii infants (Kenya), who are 
higher in lability of state, inanimate visual, and motor maturity measures than Efe 
(Tronick & Winn, 1992). The NBAS performance of Efe in early infancy may pres-
ent an additional phenotypic advantage suggestive of variation among hunter-­
gatherer infants, and underscores the need to further test the assumed costs of being 
small and growing slowly.
In sum, the somatic and neurobehavioral assets of Efe infancy are many: lower 
than expected mortality given birth weight, environment, and hunter-gatherer mean; 
higher PI at birth, higher relative weight for length and head circumference (within 
NCHS standards) for size (weight or length) during infancy and childhood; lower or 
equal childhood disease than farmers; and better neurobehavioral performance than 
expected for size. Efe genetic and phenotypic enrichment also suggests develop-
mental enhancement of morphological, neural, sensory, motor, and immune facili-
ties to environmental signals that favor their survival. Rather than small size as a 
consequence of lower investment per offspring, these developmental qualities sug-
gest other infant and intergenerational investments that standard growth compari-
sons overlook.
10.5  The Sociocultural Niche of Efe 
Hunter-Gatherer Development
So far, our inquiry into Efe phylogenetic and ontogenetic adaptations have focused 
on infant growth, health, and emerging neurobehavioral processes. We add to this 
mosaic behavioral and psychosocial processes related to the culturally organized 
experience of others, in which care is a central part. Drawing on decades of research 
on Efe ecology and practices of infant and child networks, we see these early rela-
tionships as critical to both their health and the development of social agency in a 
dynamic and often unpredictable physical, energetic, and social environment. An 
infant’s ability to weather social variability appears central to resource security, 
P. Ivey Henry and G. A. Morelli

227
thus, the somatic demands of Efe infancy are tethered to the intimate biophysiologi-
cal and psychosocial experience of care.
Tronick et al. (1987) proposed that Efe regulatory vulnerabilities are managed by 
care characterized by near constant physical contact, frequent nursing of short dura-
tions, and social stimulation. These protective features typify hunter-gatherer sys-
tems of care (Konner, 2010), and are prescribed in Western settings as interventions 
to mitigate the adverse physiological performance of preterm and LBW infants 
(Campbell-Yeo et al., 2015; Kubota et al., 2019). In forager care contexts, infant 
biosocial systems appear  organized to the rhythms of the developmental niche, 
while also priming their capacities to take advantage of it. For Efe, this involves a 
diverse set of people approaching, moving, and engaging an infant throughout 
the day.
Efe social experience is surprisingly broad and rapidly paced from infancy into 
childhood. First reports found that from birth to 4.5 months, Efe had an average of 
14.2 different caregivers, and the rate of infant transfer between caregivers increased 
from almost 4 to 8 times an hour (Tronick et al., 1987). Rather than heightening 
risks, in addition to physiological supports, these practices protect infants by mov-
ing the child, oftentimes, to unencumbered (i.e., relatively relaxed and undistracted) 
caregivers (Ivey, 2000; Ivey Henry et  al., 2005). Increasing the likelihood that 
infants spend time with less burdened, and, therefore possibly more attentive care-
givers, may mean infants experience social movement positively. They get extensive 
practice with social variability in a protective niche, allowing them more easily to 
attend to and learn from their social partners. Features of the Efe infant neurobehav-
ioral system – well-modulated alertness and high thresholds for state dysregula-
tion – assist with this learning. In time, infants develop skills to manage these fluid 
social scenes with their myriad characteristics, permanency, and interests.
10.5.1  Socially Distributive Care and Changing Infant 
Capacities for Agency
With improved technology, later research recorded continuous focal observations in 
real time, and found that while there continues to be a steady increase in unique 
partners across infancy, the rate of partner changes was higher than evident by inter-
val sampling. The rate of social partner change in a 2-h period averaged every 3 min 
from 5 months to 2 years, with only small differences in timing between ages. The 
stability of the pattern is evident in that infants between 7 and 11 months, compris-
ing those who did not toddle independently about camp (and physically choose 
partners), engaged new partners every 2  min, while mobile infants from 12 to 
15 months did so every 3 min, and from 18 to 21 months every 2 min (data were 
sampled in 15-min intervals from the infant’s morning emergence from the hut to 
dusk) (Morelli et al., 2014). Achieving the capacity to locomote and approach oth-
ers about camp, Efe infants mirror the social pace they experienced in more

228
sedentary care. They sustained this pattern given the physical, cultural, and interper-
sonal factors that enable it, such as the public landscape in which most daytime 
events occur, the freedom they have to wander and approach others in camp, and 
their developing capacities for physical (e.g., motor, verbal) and social agency. We 
see this pace as evidence of attunement to a community-wide rhythm of sociality 
and care.
Attunement to a community and pace of engagement suggests a familiarity and 
stability of relationships that Efe infants may not experience as such. Camps were 
rarely in the same locale from one observation to the next, and partner consistency 
was dramatically affected by Efe mobility. For example, on average, ~70% of infant 
partners changed from one observation to the next (from 4- to 6-month-old to 7- to 
11-month-old focal follows). While family members  related r  =.125 (e.g., first 
cousins) and higher were more consistently available than extended kin (e.g., clan) 
and non-kin, the latter groups represented 60% of nonmaternal care across all age 
ranges to 2 years of age (Morelli et al., 2014).
This care pattern would appear an unstable and insecure psychosocial experi-
ence for the child. We suggest otherwise. Efe infants are primarily positive in affect, 
and increasingly so over the course of the first 2 years (Morelli et al., 2014). There 
are also regularities in care across caregivers that infants learn to expect (e.g., expe-
riencing a rapid response when distressed (within seconds), food sharing when a 
partner is eating). Additionally, caregivers are typically well known and trusted by 
mothers (e.g., friends, frequent camp residents), and the care they provide is impor-
tant to their cooperative relationships with mothers. In fact, the number of allocare-
givers experienced at 1 year of age was positively associated with Efe survivorship 
at 3 years (but not with group size or number of kin) (Ivey, 2000).
Another indicator of their empowerment is observed in infant and young chil-
dren’s success in securing resources. As clues to the rapid pace of infant social 
engagement, the relative percentage of successful requests to others was negatively 
associated with the interval (in minutes) between partners (Morelli et al., 2014). 
Brief multiple engagements may facilitate more solicitous responses. Positioning 
infants and young children as social actors in give-and-take interactions introduces 
them to cooperative acts, of which food sharing is one of the most important. They 
are initiated into food sharing mostly by offers of (rather than requests for) food, not 
only from family members, but from many others in the camp (Morelli et al., 2019). 
And, while they have little food of their own to share, before they begin to walk they 
are taught how to divide their small share and offer it to others. In this way, others 
recognize their capacity to make such choices, and when infants and young children 
are asked for food, they are likely to share it.
These experiences of meaningful exchange enhance the sense of solicitousness 
and obligations that others feel toward the child, and these early ties are often 
extended in relationships where children as young as 3 years old may sometimes 
sleep in the huts of especially close allocaregivers. As they grow, even young chil-
dren may be found in different camps from their homes for a short period of time, 
P. Ivey Henry and G. A. Morelli

229
and older children are often fostered for longer periods, especially if one or more 
parent has died (Ivey Henry et al., 2005). For Efe infants, the early development of 
especially familiar, comfortable, and cooperative relationships appears well-timed 
with the period of increasing energetic insecurity, as nutrition needs outstrip mater-
nal milk supply, and linear growth slows precipitously.
10.5.2  Attachments and Synchrony: Biobehavioral Perspective
Infants and young children develop affiliative relationships with caregivers they 
perceive as trustworthy. As our research has demonstrated, there are many trustwor-
thy caregivers who consistently and reliably meet their needs and keep them safe in 
contexts of threat. Given this, and infants’ highly positive experience of others, we 
expect them to increasingly develop trust across many relationships. These are the 
caregivers with whom infants are likely to form attachments, which, we propose, 
are experienced as an integrated system of relationships, not as a collection of single 
attachments. For example, infants were not observed as engaged with every group 
member, but spent substantial time with many, and their positive affect was not 
associated with kinship (Morelli et al., 2014). We imagine their experience of trust 
radiates across the social landscape, rendering the camp as a whole a secure setting 
for them.
This inclusive, flexible, relational system of attachments is supported by rela-
tionship features common to all relationships people develop across the life span. 
One in particular stands out to us – synchrony. Synchrony refers to temporally coor-
dinated process between social partners that takes place at the same time or close in 
time (Feldman, 2007). With regular experience of synchrony, biobehavioral systems 
become mutually attuned (e.g., mothers adapted their heart rhythms to that of their 
3-month-olds, and vice versa, during gaze and vocal synchrony in face-to-face 
interactions (Feldman et al., 2011), and for infants, such attunement lays the basis 
for attachment relationships.
Morelli and Liu (2021) argue that Efe infants and young children experience 
high levels of synchrony with many who care for them. Frequently, care involves 
regulating infant state and establishing infant internal rhythms – indicators of syn-
chrony. Sitting on the back and hips of caregivers who are involved in rhythmically 
repetitive daily activities are other ways to experience synchrony. Care is usually a 
multisensory experience with one – or several caregivers at the same time – singing 
to, patting, and rocking infants, and multisensory processing maximizes synchro-
nous processes (Harris & Waug, 2002). In addition, infants experience synchrony 
with others with whom they are not directly involved in regularly occurring camp-­
wide activities characterized by rhythm and repetition, such as storytelling, singing, 
drumming, and clapping. Neurobehavioral organization of Efe infants and sensori-­
perceptual gene enhancements in CBHG development may aid this processing.

10.5.3  Developmental Niche Construction 
as a Synchronous Process
Synchrony across modalities and biobehavioral systems is a central dimension of 
developmental niche construction that generates expectations, predictability, and 
efficiency in relationships that facilitate and encourage social agency. When forager 
infants can anticipate the rhythm and responses of others, they can initiate actions 
and move more confidently in tune with them, and about the camp. Efe infant affect 
and the pacing of relationships suggest so, as they are passed, move, and engage 
social partners without obligating them for long periods of time, or pressing 
demands for more costly forms of care, or more food (Ivey, 2000; Morelli et al., 
2014). Infant agency is built on such confidence, strengthening multisystem capaci-
ties to engage others and the world. These insights inform the evolution and devel-
opment of human cooperation, as interpersonal synchrony in expectation and 
exchange, and the trust that grows from the sharing and reciprocity in which rela-
tionships develop, is foreshadowed by the growth, health, and social trade-offs that 
infants (and humans) must manage to survive an uncertain world.

Evolutionary Perspectives on the Role 
of Early Attachment Across the Lifespan
Jeffry A. Simpson and Margaret M. Jaeger
At its core, attachment theory is an evolutionarily based theory that articulates how 
people develop, both in terms of their personality and their social behavior, in 
response to significant environmental and interpersonal experiences throughout 
their lives. This development depends, in large part, on how they have been treated 
by close others (attachment figures) in different relationships and types of situations 
earlier in life. Indeed, it is difficult to fully appreciate attachment theory and all it 
has to offer without understanding its evolutionary foundations and purposes, both 
of which begin in infancy.
Over the past 30 years, a handful of attachment-relevant models of social devel-
opment have utilized and expanded upon key connections between attachment the-
ory and current theorizing in evolutionary psychology. As we shall see, much of this 
work has been guided by an overarching evolutionary framework known as life 
history theory (LHT). One of the primary goals of this chapter is to showcase these 
models and their underlying logic to not only reveal the fundamental role that 
attachment theory and research assume within them, but also to identify new direc-
tions in which future attachment research might head.
In this chapter, we begin by discussing some of the critical features of the physi-
cal and social environments in which our ancestors evolved, which ostensibly 
shaped the development of the attachment behavioral system in humans. We then 
discuss how and why attachment theory is considered a major, middle-level evolu-
tionary theory and highlight a few of its normative (species-typical) and individual 
difference components, especially those that are relevant to the evolutionary-based 
social development models we review later in the chapter. Following this, we dis-
cuss some of the core tenets of LHT, after which we describe six evolutionary-­
grounded models of social development, each of which leverages ideas, principles, 
and processes from attachment theory as well as current evolutionary thinking to 
explain how and why people develop in different ways across their lives, starting 
early in infancy and childhood. We conclude by discussing some ways in which

attachment theory and research might benefit from incorporating and examining 
additional constructs central to other major, middle-level evolutionary theories.
11.1  Key Features of the Social and Physical Environment 
of Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA)
To appreciate the unique problems that the attachment behavioral system evolved to 
solve, one must understand the physical and social environments in which humans 
have lived during our evolutionary history. Attachment theorists beginning with 
Bowlby (1969/1982) have speculated some about what the physical Environment of 
Evolutionary Adaptedness (EEA) was probably like, but less attention has focused 
on the social EEA (see Simpson & Belsky, 2008).
Throughout most of evolutionary history, our ancestors hunted and gathered food 
in small, cooperative, and fairly well-coordinated groups (Cronk, 1999; Kelly, 
1995). In all likelihood, most people were biologically related to other members in 
their tribe, with strangers being encountered primarily during inter-tribal trading, 
social exchanges, or war (Wright, 1994). Although some people moved in and out 
of their primary (natal) groups, many stayed within the same tribe for most or all of 
their lives. For the most part, men and women established pair bonds (Cronk, 1999), 
but serial monogamy was probably also common (Fisher, 1992). Most children 
were born approximately 4 years apart and were raised with help from extended 
family members, including some biologically unrelated individuals (Wright, 1994). 
According to Hrdy (1999, 2005), humans were “cooperative breeders” who shared 
and distributed important tasks, one of which was child rearing (see Hrdy and 
Burkart, Chap. 6, this volume). Especially during the first few years of life, young 
children were socialized by older children, particularly older siblings, if the older 
children survived the many perils of childhood (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1989). Both men 
and women provided food to their groups and families, with men doing most (but 
not all) of the hunting, and with women doing most (but not all) of the gathering 
(Wood & Eagly, 2002).
The physical environments our ancestors inhabited also varied over time in both 
their harshness and predictability (Ellis et al., 2009), which made daily life and 
parenting challenging. The attachment behavioral system, therefore, most likely 
evolved to address the challenges posed by these conditions, balancing trade-offs 
between increasing the likelihood of infant survival while also ensuring as much as 
possible parents’ own survival (Chisholm, 1996). Young children probably inferred 
what their current environment was like (e.g., its level of harshness and predictabil-
ity) based on the quality of care they received from their primary caregivers 
(Simpson & Belsky, 2016). All of these probable features of our social and physical 
EEA must be considered when conceptualizing the purpose and functions of the 
attachment behavioral system in the context of an evolutionary framework.

11.1.1  Attachment as a Middle-Level Evolutionary Theory
Similar to almost all evolutionary theories, attachment theory has two primary com-
ponents: (a) a normative component, which explains modal (species-typical) pat-
terns, processes, and stages of attachment in humans (e.g., “How and why are 
attachment bonds formed in children and adults?”), and (b) an individual difference 
component, which addresses deviations from modal (normative) patterns, pro-
cesses, and stages (e.g., “How and why do different patterns of attachment emerge 
in children and adults?”).
According to Bowlby (1969/1982, 1973, 1980), the attachment system evolved 
to serve three basic functions: (1) to maintain close proximity between vulnerable 
infants and their stronger/older/wiser caregivers; (2) to provide infants a safe place 
to retreat for comfort and soothing when threatened; and (3) to provide infants a 
secure base within which to gain confidence and resume exploration of the world 
once threat abates. Bowlby believed that these three functions, if met sufficiently, 
should have, on average, increased the likelihood of infant survival and facilitated 
their social development, especially considering that humans are born in an under-
developed physical state and must rely on caregivers to meet their basic needs for 
several years (Trevathan, 1987). This strong dependency makes it necessary for 
infants to maintain close physical and psychological proximity to their stronger/
older/wiser caregivers. Close proximity allows caregivers to provide sufficient food, 
warmth, and safety to their vulnerable infants as well as a supportive place from 
which infants can explore their world and eventually pursue other important life 
tasks and goals.
For these normative (species-typical) features of attachment to emerge, however, 
there needs to be synchrony between caregivers and their infants. Evidence of such 
synchrony has been documented between caregivers and their young infants across 
many cultures (see Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1989, for a review). Most caregivers behave in 
ways that facilitate emotional bonding with their infants from the opening days of 
life, such as emphasizing eye contact, automatically holding infants the ideal dis-
tance away for their infant’s underdeveloped eyes to see clearly, and exaggerating 
facial expressions once eye contact is made with their infant (Hane & Fox, 2016). 
These and other forms of synchronization between caregivers and their infants also 
facilitate the continued development of the attachment behavioral system as infants 
transition to becoming young children.
Attachment behavior early in life develops across four stages, beginning at birth 
and continuing to approximately 3 years of age (Bowlby, 1969/1982; Main, 1990). 
During the first stage from birth to about 3 months old, most infants enact attachment-­
related behavior (e.g., being soothed by being held when upset) toward many differ-
ent adults, showing little preference for a specific caregiver or a small set of 
caregivers. From about 3 months of age until approximately 7 months, most infants 
enter a second stage during which their attachment-related behaviors become spe-
cific to either one or a small set of caregivers with whom they regularly interact. 
During the third stage, which runs from about 7 months to 3 years of age, infants’

240
internal working models (i.e., their general expectations about how their caregivers 
will respond to them) start to develop as the three primary functions of attachment 
(proximity maintenance, safe haven, and secure base) begin to emerge. At approxi-
mately age three and beyond, which marks the fourth stage, attachment processes 
begin to shift from a focus on physical proximity maintenance to a focus on psycho-
logical felt security (Sroufe & Waters, 1977) as children become more active and 
independent. During adolescence, most individuals gradually shift their attachment 
bonds from their primary caregivers to close peers (i.e., best friends) and eventually 
to long-term romantic partners.
Children, however, are exposed to different kinds of rearing environments and, 
subsequently, different styles and patterns of parenting. The Strange Situation 
Procedure, a lab experience in which infants are exposed to “danger cues” while 
their caregivers have an opportunity to comfort them, identifies stable individual 
differences in parent-child attachment relationships (Ainsworth et al., 1978). The 
manner in which the attachment behavioral system operates within a particular rela-
tionship can be categorized in one of four patterns: secure, insecure-anxious/resis-
tant, insecure-avoidant/resistant (see Ainsworth, 1979; Main, 1981, 1996), and 
disorganized (see Lyons-Ruth & Jacobvitz, 2016).
Secure attachment patterns tend to emerge when caregivers behave in a warm, 
responsive manner to their distressed infants, routinely providing them with effec-
tive, soothing comfort. Infants and young children who are securely attached to 
their primary caregivers trust and rely on them to regulate their emotions, especially 
when infants are distressed. Insecure-anxious/resistant attachments usually emerge 
when caregivers do not respond to their infant’s distress in a consistent or skilled 
manner, perhaps due to lack of parenting knowledge, under-involvement, or distrac-
tions. Infants with insecure-anxious/resistant attachments tend to be clingy, vocal, 
and difficult to comfort, particularly when they become upset. Insecure-­avoidant/
resistant attachments are typically witnessed when caregivers consistently push 
away or reject their infant’s bids for comfort when infants are distressed, either 
because they do not like or want to be a parent or they feel overwhelmed by parent-
ing responsibilities. Infants with insecure-avoidant/resistant attachments tend to be 
more independent, quieter, and less likely to turn to their caregivers for comfort 
when distressed. There is a fourth attachment pattern—disorganization—which 
usually emerges in response to parental abuse or mistreatment (Hesse & Main, 
2000). Disorganized children often display strange or conflicting behavioral reac-
tions when upset, revealing their lack of a coherent strategy to seek or maintain 
contact with their caregivers and utilize them as a source of safety and comfort.
Even though attachment insecurity tends to be associated with more negative 
psychosocial outcomes (Thompson, 2016), insecure-anxious/resistant and insecure-­
avoidant/resistant attachment patterns are adaptive in evolutionary meaningful ways 
(e.g., Main, 1981; Szepsenwol & Simpson, 2019). For example, the clingy, protest-
ing behaviors commonly displayed by anxious-resistant infants help them to draw 
the attention of caregivers who are failing to provide consistent attention and care. 
Moreover, the standoffish behavior of avoidant-resistant infants keeps their poten-
tially reluctant caregivers from feeling overburdened or overwhelmed, increasing

the likelihood that such children are not abandoned. Secure attachment patterns also 
make evolutionarily adaptive sense, but primarily in benign environments that per-
mit warmer, more responsive caregiving, which was by no means the norm in evo-
lutionary history. These distinct attachment patterns and associated behaviors not 
only help children cope more effectively with their current environments; they also 
provide a glimpse of what children might eventually encounter in their own future 
environments. We now introduce a broad evolutionary framework within which 
attachment theory and its core principles are embedded.
11.2  Life History Theory
At its core, life history theory (LHT) addresses how and why individuals allocate 
time, energy, and resources to different traits, behaviors, and/or life tasks, given 
certain trade-offs that might affect their reproductive fitness (Del Guidice et al., 
2016). Cast another way, LHT attempts to identify the selection pressures that 
would have influenced how our ancestors should have allocated their time, energy, 
and resources to physical development, growth, reproduction, body repair, or aging. 
Broadly speaking, individuals can increase their reproductive fitness in two funda-
mental ways: (1) they can “invest” (either consciously or unconsciously) in traits or 
attributes that affect the timing of their mortality (i.e., the age at which they die), or 
(2) they can “invest” in traits or attributes that influence the timing of their fertility 
(i.e., the age and rate at which they reproduce).
Many life history traits/attributes, however, have opposing effects on mortality 
and fertility (Del Guidice et al., 2016). For example, traits or attributes that improve 
fertility through more frequent or greater mating effort tend to shorten survival 
because many of the traits that make people (particularly men) more attractive to the 
opposite-sex compromise the immune system (Grafen, 1990). Moreover, the alloca-
tion of energy and resources to growth during development usually impedes fertility 
when individuals are younger, but enhances it after they reach sexual maturity 
(Charnov, 1993). As a result, individuals must make three basic trade-offs during 
their lives: (1) whether to invest in present (immediate) reproduction or future 
(delayed) reproduction; (2) whether to invest in higher quantity or higher quality 
offspring; and (3) whether to invest in mating effort or parenting effort. The way in 
which each trade-off is made should be contingent on many factors, such as the 
nature of the local environment (e.g., how difficult it is, the number of pathogens it 
contains, whether biparental care is necessary), an individual’s health, skills, and 
resources at a given time, the health, skills, and resources of others (e.g., kin, poten-
tial mates, competitors), and so on.

11.2.1  Lifespan Attachment-Evolutionary Models 
of Social Development
Attachment theory was developed in part to explain social and personality develop-
ment across the lifespan (Bowlby, 1979). Early attachment theory and research, 
however, focused primarily on barriers to inclusive fitness, especially problems sur-
rounding infant survival, rather than other major barriers to fitness, such as prob-
lems associated with mating and parenting later in life (for an exception, see Main, 
1981). In fact, the possible evolutionary function(s) of childhood attachment pat-
terns were not linked theoretically to the development of different adult romantic 
attachment and mating orientations until Belsky et al. (1991) published a ground-
breaking model that conceptualized social development from an evolutionary/
attachment perspective.
11.2.1.1  Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper’s Model
Inspired by LHT and the effects of early father absence during childhood (e.g., 
Draper & Harpending, 1982), Belsky et al. (1991) outlined the first evolution-based, 
attachment-oriented lifespan model of human social development. According to this 
model, early social experiences “prepare” young children for the social and physical 
environments they are likely to inhabit across their lifetime. The model focuses 
primarily on the rate of development (faster vs. slower) and the trade-off between 
offspring quantity versus quality. As depicted in Fig. 11.1, the model suggests that: 
(a) early contextual factors in and around the family of origin (e.g., the degree of 
stress, spousal harmony, and financial resources) affect (b) early child-rearing expe-
riences (e.g., the level of sensitive, supportive, and responsive caregiving they 
receive). These experiences, in turn, then shape (c) psychological and behavioral 
development (e.g., the development of specific attachment patterns and associated 
internal working models), which influence (d) somatic development (i.e., how 
quickly sexual maturation is reached) and ultimately (e) the adoption of faster vs. 
slower orientations toward both mating and parenting.
According to the Belsky et al. model, two developmental trajectories result in 
two phenotypically different reproductive strategies in adulthood. One strategy 
reflects a short-term, opportunistic orientation toward mating and parenting in 
which sex occurs relatively earlier in life, romantic pair bonds tend to be weak, 
fleeting, and unstable, and parental investment is lower. During our evolutionary 
past, this orientation would have increased the quantity of offspring, on average. 
The second strategy reflects a longer-term, more investing orientation toward mat-
ing and parenting in which sex occurs comparatively later in life, romantic pair 
bonds are stronger and more enduring, and parental investment is greater. Across 
evolutionary history, this orientation would have maximized offspring quality, on 
average. The most unique prediction stemming from this model is that early rearing 
experiences should alter the timing of puberty. Specifically, sexual maturation

should occur earlier in individuals who develop on the “quantity trajectory” relative 
to the “quality trajectory.”
A sizable amount of cross-sectional and more recently longitudinal research sup-
ports various stages of the Belsky et al. model (see Belsky, 2012; Simpson & Belsky, 
2016 for reviews). For example, higher socio-emotional stress within families is 
associated with more insensitive, harsh, rejecting, inconsistent, and/or unpredict-
able parenting practices. Moreover, economic hardship (McLoyd, 1990), occupa-
tional stress (Bronfenbrenner & Crouter, 1982), marital discord (Emery, 1988), and 
psychological distress (McLoyd, 1990) are all related to more hostile or detached/
indifferent styles of parenting. Conversely, greater social support and more abun-
dant economic resources forecast warmer, more sensitive child-rearing practices 
(Lempers et al., 1989), most likely because parents who are less stressed tend to be 
more patient with or tolerant of their children (Belsky, 1984).
The hypothesized link between parental sensitivity and the psychological and 
behavioral development of children is also well established. For example, during the 
first year of life, insensitive and unresponsive caregiving predicts the development 
of insecure attachment patterns in children (De Wolff & van IJzendoorn, 1997), 
which forecasts more behavior problems later in childhood (e.g., Matas et al., 1978; 
Waters et al., 1979). During elementary school, for instance, insecure children typi-
cally display more behavior problems, especially involving aggression and

development

244
disobedience (Lewis et al., 1984). These behaviors are presumably guided by their 
insecure working models, which “prepare” the child to engage in more opportunis-
tic advantage-taking and less communal relationships later in life.
Belsky et al. (1991) also conjectured that children who are exposed to greater 
socio-emotional stress, have insecure attachment patterns, and display behavior dis-
orders should reach puberty (i.e., reproductive capacity) earlier than children with-
out these attributes. According to LHT (Chisholm, 1993, 1999), in environments 
where resources are scarce, relationship bonds are weak, and mortality risks are 
high, individuals should allocate more energy and effort toward physical develop-
ment, earlier mating, and shorter-term romantic pair bonds because doing so would 
have increased the likelihood of reproducing before death in the EEA. Conversely, 
environments in which resources are plentiful and relationship bonds are stronger 
and more enduring should motivate individuals to channel greater energy and effort 
to somatic development, later sexual maturity, delayed mating, and longer-term 
romantic pair bonds that facilitate higher quality parenting. In these more benign 
evolutionary environments, reproductive fitness would have been enhanced by 
delaying reproduction until individuals acquired the skills and resources needed to 
ensure sufficient quality of each offspring, allowing offspring to benefit from the 
embodied capital that humans often require for successful reproduction.
Several studies have found evidence consistent with these expectations (Belsky, 
2012; Simpson & Belsky, 2016). For example, greater parent-child warmth fore-
casts delayed pubertal development in both prospective longitudinal studies (e.g., 
Ellis et al., 1999; Graber et al., 1995) and in retrospective or concurrent ones (e.g., 
Kim et al., 1997; Miller & Pasta, 2000). Moreover, greater parent-child conflict and 
coercion predict earlier pubertal development in both prospective longitudinal stud-
ies (e.g., Ellis & Essex, 2007; Moffitt et al., 1992) as well as retrospective or concur-
rent ones (e.g., Kim et al., 1997). Furthermore, parents involved in happier, less 
conflict-ridden relationships tend to have daughters who reach puberty later, both in 
prospective longitudinal studies (e.g., Ellis et al., 1999; Ellis & Garber, 2000) and in 
non-prospective ones (e.g., Kim et al., 1997). In addition, attachment insecurity in 
the first 1–2 years of life prospectively forecasts the earlier age of menarche (Belsky 
et al., 2010). Not all studies, however, have documented puberty-related effects. 
Steinberg (1988), for instance, did not find associations between either the amount 
of family conflict or coercion and pubertal timing in a sample of girls. However, 
family experience/pubertal timing effects have emerged in studies capable of 
accounting for possible genetic confounds (e.g., Tithers & Ellis, 2008; Pesonen 
et al., 2008).
It is important to emphasize that all of these findings come from studies of girls, 
but not boys. What might explain this gender difference? One possible explanation 
is that the early versus later reproduction trade-off might be more important for 
females, whereas the trade-off between somatic development and reproduction 
might be more pressing for males, who often must engage in greater intrasexual 
competition in order to attract and retain mates (see James et al., 2012).
Evidence relevant to the final stages of Belsky et al.’s model comes from two 
sources: (1) research linking adult attachment orientations to mating and romantic

relationship functioning, and (2) research linking adult attachment and parenting 
practices. Besides several cross-sectional studies that have confirmed these connec-
tions (e.g., Brennan & Shaver 1995; Miller & Fishkin, 1997; Simpson, 1990), recent 
longitudinal research from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation 
has provided fairly compelling support for the model. Simpson et al. (2007), for 
example, found that individuals who were insecure at age 1 in the Strange Situation 
experience and express more negative emotions in their romantic relationships 
20 years later, an effect that is mediated through their lower social competence in 
grade school and their less-secure same-sex friendships at age 16. Additionally, 
Simpson et al. (2012) have shown that exposure to more unpredictable forms of life 
stress during the first few years of life predicts more risk-taking in early adulthood, 
as indexed by having more sexual partners and scoring higher on aggression, delin-
quency, and ties to criminal activity by the early 20s. Szepsenwol et al. (2017) have 
shown that being exposed to more unpredictable environments early in life predicts 
more unrestricted sociosexuality (i.e., the adoption of a fast life history strategy) in 
early adulthood. Finally, Szepsenwol et al. (2015) have found that men who are 
exposed to more unpredictable environments early in life have a more negative ori-
entation to parenting at age 32, whereas women do not. Furthermore, men exposed 
to more unpredictable early environments are more likely to have received lower 
quality care from their mothers early in life, which in turn predicts them having 
more insecure attachment representations of their childhood in early adulthood. 
These insecure representations, in turn, predict having a less-positive orientation to 
being a parent at age 32.
11.2.1.2  Chisholm’s Model
Chisholm (1993, 1996) proposed an alternate model of reproductive strategies, one 
that highlights the life history trade-off of immediate versus delayed reproduction. 
This model contains several novel features beyond those proposed by Belsky and 
colleagues. For example, the Chisholm model suggests that local mortality rates are 
the specific cues that children use to regulate the rate of their physical/sexual devel-
opment as well as their adult reproductive strategies. The principle reason for this 
expectation is that higher mortality rates should have been a valid indicator of how 
difficult local environments were in the EEA, and they should also have been asso-
ciated with poorer caregiving in our ancestral past. According to this model, paren-
tal indifference or insensitivity—which should have been valid indicators of higher 
local mortality rates—should have motivated children to develop avoidant working 
models and associated behavioral patterns, which in turn may have increased fitness 
in difficult environments. Lower mortality rates, indicative of more benign environ-
ments, should have generated better, more attentive caregiving in general. Sensitive 
parenting, in other words, should have “communicated” to children that premature 
death was less likely, instilling secure working models and behaviors that should 
have enhanced fitness in more hospitable environments.
11  Evolutionary Perspectives on the Role of Early Attachment Across the Lifespan

246
Consistent with Chisholm’s model, robust associations exist between having 
experienced more adverse life conditions and the expectations that people have for 
their longevity and the timing of their reproduction later in life (Nettle, 2010; Nettle 
& Cockerill, 2010). For example, when life expectancy declines on average within 
a geographic area, most women in the area reproduce at a relatively younger age 
(Wilson & Daly, 1997). Moreover, teen mothers who believe they will die at a com-
paratively younger age tend to have their children earlier in life (Johns, 2003). These 
findings are consistent with what is known as the “weathering hypothesis” 
(Geronimus, 1996), which suggests that having children earlier in life is an adaptive 
response when women believe they are less healthy than their same-aged peers. 
Viewed together, these findings support the premise that local mortality rates served 
as a valid cue that may shape alternate reproductive strategies in adulthood.
Chisholm’s model also addresses time preference—people’s tendency to dis-
count the future by favoring small, immediate rewards now instead of large, delayed 
rewards later—as another psychological mechanism tying early childhood experi-
ences with adult mating and parenting behavior (Chisholm, 1999). The rationale for 
this focus is that children raised in harsh or unpredictable environments, where 
waiting for rewards could result in leaving no descendants, should prefer immediate 
payoffs, even when delayed ones might be superior.
Finally, Chisholm’s model devotes attention to two primary threats to the sur-
vival and growth of children in the EEA—a parent’s inability and unwillingness to 
invest in their offspring—both of which children should have evolved to detect and 
try to counteract. Chisholm suggests that attachment security reflects an adaptation 
to a parent’s ability and willingness to provide sufficiently good investment, as 
indexed by warm and sensitive parenting. He further proposes that attachment 
avoidance is an adaptation to a parent’s unwillingness to invest (regardless of their 
ability), as indexed by cold and rejecting parenting. Finally, he claims that anxious 
attachment is an adaptation to a parent’s inability to invest, as indexed by inconsis-
tent, unpredictable parenting.
The Belsky et al. and Chisholm models are important because they have focused 
attention on how and especially why certain types of early experiences tend to shape 
development across the life course. Neither model, however, addresses some addi-
tional variables that may also influence the adoption of specific reproductive strate-
gies in adulthood. Mate selection involves a host of other factors, such as a potential 
mate’s compatibility, health, ability to accrue and share resources, and capacity to 
teach and socialize offspring (Gangestad & Simpson, 2000). Moreover, the early 
psychosocial acceleration models such as those by Belsky et al. and Chisholm did 
not address the unique reproductive roles of men and women (Buss & Schmitt, 
1993; Geary, 2005). As discussed below, the most critical trade-off for most women 
is likely to be between early vs. later reproduction, whereas the most important 
trade-off for most men may center on growth versus reproduction. Despite these 
limitations, both models have significantly advanced our understanding of attach-
ment and social development across the lifespan.

247
11.2.1.3  Del Giudice’s Model
Del Giudice (2009) formulated a model that directly addresses sex differences 
within an attachment/evolutionary framework. A reasonably large body of cross-­
cultural research has revealed that boys are somewhat more likely to be avoidantly 
attached in middle childhood, whereas girls tend to be somewhat more anxiously 
attached (Del Giudice, 2009; van IJzendoorn & Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2010). 
According to Del Giudice’s model, sex differences in attachment patterns beginning 
in middle childhood could have been evolutionarily adaptive if they reflect the ini-
tial enactment of sex-specific life history strategies. In particular, early psychosocial 
stress and insecure attachment patterns may serve as external and internal cues of 
heightened environmental risk, which shift development toward reproductive strate-
gies that facilitate current reproduction over later reproduction and/or prioritize 
mating effort over parenting effort. In line with the well-documented sex differences 
in mating and parenting effort (see Geary, 2005), more insecure males tend to be 
avoidantly attached, whereas more insecure females are anxiously attached, with 
each of these behavioral strategies increasing investment from the kin and mates of 
males and females, respectively.
Perhaps the most novel element of Del Guidice’s model is the assertion that sex 
differences in attachment should emerge during middle childhood rather than ear-
lier in life, contrary to what psychosocial acceleration models anticipate. According 
to his model, adrenarche (the early stages of sexual maturation) is a “developmental 
switch-point” that reorganizes attachment starting in middle childhood, which then 
has noteworthy developmental implications later in life. During early middle child-
hood, for example, insecure attachment patterns become sex-biased, shunting 
reproductive strategies down somewhat sex-differentiated developmental pathways. 
To the extent that attachment security (versus insecurity) was a valid indicator of the 
amount of risk in a child’s immediate environment in the EEA, it could have been 
retained by evolutionary processes to function as a stable and adaptive behavioral 
trait. Of course, strategies adopted earlier in life can be altered later during the 
course of development, especially if earlier strategies no longer address environ-
mental demands later in development. This flexibility is important because avoidant 
and anxious attachment patterns appear to have different adaptive values for boys 
and girls, particularly with regard to successful competition within same-sex peer 
groups during middle childhood (Del Guidice, 2009).
Indeed, the strongest selection pressure on attachment patterns during middle 
childhood may well have stemmed from intrasexual competition within peer groups 
as children begin competing with one another for status, attention, and resources. 
Successful negotiations within peer groups ought to be particularly challenging for 
insecurely attached children, who cannot necessarily turn to nuclear family mem-
bers to buffer them from many of the stresses and failures that occur when children 
enter grade school. The avoidant behavioral pattern, which is characterized by 
higher levels of aggression, strong self-reliance, and inflated self-esteem, tends to 
be used more effectively by males as they attempt to gain higher status and popular-
ity within their middle-childhood peer groups (Benenson, 2014). Girls, on the other 
11  Evolutionary Perspectives on the Role of Early Attachment Across the Lifespan

248
hand, shift toward the anxious behavioral pattern, which helps them utilize “tend-­
and-­befriend” tactics (Taylor et al., 2000), which result in greater success within 
female peer groups.
11.2.1.4  Ellis’ Model
In developing their evolutionary model of reproductive strategies, Ellis and col-
leagues (1999; Ellis & Garber, 2000) borrowed concepts from work on father 
absence (Draper & Harpending, 1982) along with parental investment theory 
(Trivers, 1972) to examine the unique role that fathers play in the emergence of 
reproductive strategies in girls. Whereas Belsky et al. (1991) viewed early father 
absence as a marker of stress mainly within the family of origin, Ellis (2004) pro-
poses that father absence (or stepfather presence) is its own powerful evolutionary 
cue communicating low, unpredictable, or declining paternal investment.
There is abundant prospective evidence showing that father absence predicts 
accelerated pubertal development in most girls (e.g., Campbell & Udry, 1995; Ellis 
& Garber, 2000; Ellis et al., 1999). Similar effects, however, have not been found in 
African-American samples (e.g., Campbell & Udry, 1995; Rowe, 2000), and studies 
have not always revealed stronger effects for fathering (or the quality of the father-­
child relationship) versus mothering (or the quality of the mother-child relationship) 
(e.g., Ellis et al., 2011). What there is consensus on is the robust finding that the 
earlier father absence takes place (particularly within the first 5 years of a child’s 
life), the more powerfully it predicts the earlier age of puberty in girls (e.g., Ellis & 
Garber, 2000; Quinlan, 2003). Furthermore, the presence of stepfathers also influ-
ences pubertal timing in girls, which might explain some prior father absence effects 
(Ellis, 2004). Supporting this assertion, greater conflict between the mother and 
stepfather in conjunction with earlier stepfather presence appears to accelerate 
pubertal development in girls (Ellis & Garber, 2000). Finally, pubertal development 
in girls tends to be delayed the longer fathers care for their daughters during the first 
few years of life and the more fathers have warm, supportive relationships with their 
daughters early in life (Ellis et al., 1999).
11.2.1.5  Hazan/Zeifman’s and Kirkpatrick’s Models
Other models have focused more squarely on adult romantic pair bonds from an 
attachment/evolutionary perspective. One such model, proposed by Hazan and 
Zeifman (1999; Zeifman & Hazan, 2008), suggests that adult romantic relationships 
represent a unique type of attachment bond, which has some similarities with par-
ent–child attachment bonds (see Shaver et  al., 1988). Both young children and 
adults, for example, express similar reactions to separation from or the loss of their 
attachment figures. Furthermore, both children and adults behave in somewhat simi-
lar ways when seeking physical contact, expressing emotional intimacy, and dis-
playing affection toward their attachment figures.
J. A. Simpson and M. M. Jaeger

249
Hazan and Zeifman (1999) hypothesize that the basic evolutionary purpose of 
forming secure attachment relationships in adulthood is to promote stable, enduring 
pair bonds between mates so they can support one another and provide better care 
to their children (Zeifman & Hazan, 2016). Pair bonding, in other words, may have 
evolved to facilitate the reproductive fitness of both parents and their children (see 
also Fletcher et al., 2015). Supporting this account, adult mating strategies are asso-
ciated with the pair bond status of one’s parents in that father absence and greater 
marital discord in one’s family of origin both forecast earlier sexual maturation, 
enacting short-term adult mating strategies, and having less stable marriages 
(Belsky, 1999). Children with pair-bonded parents who are likely to be securely 
attached, in contrast, are more inclined to adopt longer-term mating strategies and 
place greater emphasis on investing in their children (Hazan & Zeifman, 1999). 
Pair-bonded partners also contribute to their own reproductive success by providing 
more support to one another, which tends to be associated with better physical and 
mental health (Zeifman & Hazan, 1997).
Kirkpatrick (1998) has offered an alternative view of the evolutionary function of 
adult romantic attachment and its ties to specific reproductive strategies. Similar to 
the models proposed by Belsky et al., Chisholm, and Del Guidice, Kirkpatrick con-
jectures that adult romantic attachment orientations (secure, avoidant, and anxious) 
evolved to enhance reproductive fitness in relation to early childhood experiences. 
As discussed earlier, the allocation time and energy to mating effort versus parent-
ing effort is one of the critical life history trade-offs. Kirkpatrick (1998) and others 
(e.g., Gangestad & Simpson, 2000) have proposed that, during evolutionary history, 
it may not have always been adaptive for women and men to pursue long-term, 
monogamous mating strategies. If so, adult attachment orientations could have pro-
vided a way to adopt the best mating strategy depending on one’s childhood experi-
ences, especially the quality of early parental care and investment received. On 
average, individuals who received consistently good, sensitive, and responsive par-
enting should have developed secure working models and should have pursued 
long-term, more committed mating strategies. Indeed, secure adults do usually 
report higher levels of trust, intimacy, and commitment in their romantic relation-
ships, and they tend to become involved with secure partners, which further pro-
motes the stability of their relationships (Feeney, 2016). Avoidantly attached adults, 
by comparison, tend to have less trusting, less intimate, and less committed relation-
ships, and they are more likely to engage in short-term mating strategies, which 
result in less stable, less satisfactory relationships (Simpson et al., 2004). Most anx-
iously attached adults claim that they want long-term mates, but their strong need to 
please and be desirable to potential romantic partners frequently leads them into 
short-term romantic relationships that tend to be unstable (Kirkpatrick, 1998).

11.3  Stepping Back: How Attachment Theory Can Benefit 
from Incorporating Elements of Other 
Evolutionary Theories
Considered together, these early life attachment-based evolutionary models of 
social development illustrate the complex interconnections between an infant’s 
early rearing environment, their experience of receiving care, and the internal work-
ing models that eventually guide their social development, starting in infancy and 
stretching across their lives. In the same way that each of these models has benefited 
from the incorporation of attachment principles to stipulate how developmental pro-
cesses are likely to be affected by certain environmental conditions, attachment 
theory might also benefit from incorporating some key ideas and principles underly-
ing LHT (Szepsenwol & Simpson, 2021).
Take, for example, the different forms of attachment insecurity. Attachment the-
ory and research suggest that anxious and avoidant attachment patterns in children 
stem at least in part from differences in caregiver sensitivity, with anxious attach-
ment occurring in response to inconsistent or unpredictable care, and with avoidant 
attachment being generated in part by consistent parental rejection or rebuffing. As 
reviewed above, a great deal of evidence has documented connections between the 
nature of the early caregiving environment and the degree of parental sensitivity. 
Much less work, however, has examined whether and how other features of the early 
environment shape the development of these insecure attachment patterns.
Chisholm (1993, 1996), for example, discusses two primary reasons for insensi-
tive parenting: a parent’s inability to provide care in a sensitive and responsive man-
ner, and a parent’s unwillingness to do so. He posits that caregivers who have neither 
the skill nor the ability to parent a child sensitively, but would be willing to do so if 
circumstances were different, are likely to engage in less predictable caregiving, 
which typically should result in anxious attachment. On the other hand, caregivers 
who are simply unwilling to parent sensitively and responsively should display 
colder, more disengaged caregiving, usually culminating in avoidant attachment. 
These ideas—linking the ability versus the willingness to parent with the quality of 
parental care in response to specific features of the local environment—have 
received insufficient empirical attention to date.
Furthermore, even though there is good empirical evidence that environments 
affect parenting behavior, the unique effects that the predictability or harshness of 
the local environment has on specific modes of parenting and infant attachment pat-
terns have not been extensively examined (for an exception, see Simpson, 2019). Do 
unpredictable environments encountered early in life reliably produce inconsistent 
caregiving, which results in anxious attachment patterns in young children? Do 
harsh environments early in life reliably generate more rejecting caregiving, which 
results in avoidant attachment patterns in young children? Do extreme levels of 
unpredictability and harshness encountered early in life interact to predict other 
forms of attachment insecurity, such as the disorganized pattern? And what role

does the sensitivity of parenting play in moderating (or mediating) these associa-
tions? All of these questions deserve examination.
11.4  Conclusion
As noted at the beginning of this chapter, attachment theory is a major, middle-level 
evolutionary theory (Simpson, 1999), one that provides an underlying current that 
links all of the evolutionary theories and models summarized in this chapter. Thus, 
understanding the nature of our earliest attachment relationships—especially those 
in infancy—is key to understanding the implications of each of these theories and 
models, including the mechanisms through which they operate across the lifespan. 
Early attachment patterns and their associated internal working models shunt indi-
viduals down different developmental trajectories, shaping how they respond to 
future attachment-relevant relationships, environments, and events.
Nevertheless, as evolutionary approaches advance, so too must attachment the-
ory. One promising avenue forward would involve devoting greater attention to 
understanding how critical features of the early rearing environment, such as its 
degree of harshness and/or predictability, impact the ability and/or willingness of 
parents to provide sensitive, responsive care to their children. It will also be impor-
tant to document how these variables are prospectively related to the consistency 
with which parents enact sensitive/responsive versus insensitive/non-responsive 
care across time as their children grow and develop. Addressing these issues will 
advance not only our understanding of the origins and nature of parenting, but of 
attachment theory, as well.

Beyond the Language Module: Musicality 
as a Stepping Stone Towards Language 
Acquisition
Hirokazu Doi and Nobuo Masataka
12.1  Presumed Dissociation of Music and Language
Music is among the most ancient forms of art in human history (Masataka, 2010). 
The universality of music suggests that music has served some functional roles in 
increasing the survival odds of mankind. However, specific advantages of music 
conferred to human survival remain elusive. Existing theoretical and empirical stud-
ies show that music enhances group cohesion and helps emotional regulation (Tarr 
et al., 2014). In contrast, some theorists see no survival benefit in music, a view 
which is championed by Steven Pinker’s famous characterization of music as “audi-
tory cheesecake” (Pinker, 1997).
There has been a long-standing debate over whether music and language pro-
cessing share the same processing stages and recruit the same neural regions. Recent 
studies challenge a simple dichotomy between music and language processing by 
showing activation of overlapping neural regions by music and language (Koelsch 
et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2017; but see, Peretz, et al., 2015) and impaired processing of 
linguistic prosody in amusic patients (Thompson et al., 2012). Thus, the linguistic 
ability is not as impermeable as presumed and shares part of the processing stages 
with music.
Interestingly, it has been reported that long-term musical training enhances lan-
guage processing at various processing stages (Zhao & Kuhl, 2016), including fun-
damental frequency (f0) extraction at the brainstem (Wong et al., 2007). Therefore, 
it seems only natural to postulate that machinery recruited in music processing has

facilitated the evolution of language and helps in language acquisition in human 
infants (Masataka, 2008).
In this chapter, we first discuss the commonalities in processing stages recruited 
between music and language. Among the perceptual functions presumably recruited 
in both musical and linguistic domains, a substantial amount of knowledge has 
accumulated about the perception of frequency structure and rhythmic pattern. 
Thus, in the second section of this chapter, we provide an overview of empirical 
data on the developmental course of these perceptual functions in musical and lin-
guistic domains in human infants. In the last section of this chapter, we propose a 
hypothesis regarding the evolutionary roots of musicality that is utilized in language 
acquisition in human infants today.
12.2  Commonality Between Music and Language
Language can transmit messages that are far more semantically complex than 
music. However, the sound stream of language shares many acoustic characteristics 
with musical sounds. First, vowel sounds have similar spectral structures as musical 
chords. When pronouncing vowels, the power of different frequencies is modified 
by resonance in the vocal tract, and consequently, some of the frequencies become 
prominent in vocal sound. Such peaks in spectral power in a few frequency ranges, 
called formants, define the perceived vowel category. Thus, analysis of the relative 
relationship between formant frequencies is required in vowel categorization. The 
similar ability of relative pitch perception is indispensable in music perception 
because the perceptual quality of musical chords is also determined by the relation-
ship between the pitches of musical notes played simultaneously.
Second, both music and language are characterized by a hierarchical structure 
(Jackendoff & Lerdahl, 2006). Language is governed by grammatical rules that 
define the ordering of words in a hierarchical manner. Similarly, identical sound 
sequences are played repeatedly within a music score and are grouped into larger 
motifs hierarchically. Thus, the ability of perceptual grouping together with the sta-
tistical analysis of repeated sequences are valuable in analysing the global structure 
underlying the sound stream in both music and language.
Third, pitch contour, the temporal course of pitch change, is essential in process-
ing both musical and linguistic sounds. Pitch contour creates a musical melody that 
induces vivid emotional reactions and even conveys semantic information (Koelsch 
et  al., 2004). Likewise, linguistic prosody plays an important role in conveying 
emotional and semantic information (Doi et al., 2013). The human linguistic system 
interprets the meaning of identical sentences differently depending on the pitch con-
tour, as in the case of pitch change at the end of utterances in declarative sentences 
and yes-no questions. Further, pitch contour sometimes specifies a structurally 
important location, e.g., phrasal boundary, in the linguistic stream.
Fourth, both music and language have a culturally transmitted rhythmic struc-
ture. Folk music in several regions has a unique metric structure that is different

from those seen in other regions of the world. Likewise, some researchers claim that 
language can be grouped into families according to its rhythmic structure (Nazzi & 
Ramus, 2003). Culture-specific patterns of auditory rhythms exert such strong influ-
ences on the perceptual system through postnatal exposure that adults have diffi-
culty detecting slight changes and reproducing rhythmic patterns with culturally 
unfamiliar metric structures (Hannon & Trehub, 2005a; Collier & Wright, 1995).
12.3  Contributions of Musicality to Human 
Language Acquisition
Given the close similarity between music and language as described above, neural 
mechanisms recruited in musical processing could help in processing linguistic 
materials as well. Infants at the prelinguistic stage are faced with the task of analys-
ing sound streams and grasping their underlying structure without any prior knowl-
edge (but see Chomsky, 1965). The primary tenet of the prosodic bootstrapping 
hypothesis of language acquisition is that prosodic information, such as lexical 
rhythm and melodic contour in the linguistic sound stream, scaffold infants’ analy-
sis of the mother tongue. Prosodic cues are loosely related to grammatical structure. 
Therefore, prosodic information, a collection of musical properties of language, can 
help infants learn their mother tongue.
Studies on auditory perception in the fetus raise the appealing possibility that 
prosodic bootstrapping of language acquisition starts during the prenatal period. 
Fetuses are exposed to environmental sounds in the womb. However, the abdominal 
wall filters out high-frequency components of external sounds, and consequently, 
phonemic information is almost lost. Salient information contained in the filtered 
sound heard in the womb is mainly a prosodic pattern of language. In DeCasper 
et al. (1994), mothers read target rhymes each day for 4 weeks during pregnancy. 
Researchers then measured the fetal heart rate when hearing the target rhyme and an 
unfamiliar rhyme. There was a more notable deceleration in heart rate when hearing 
the familiar rhyme, indicating that fetuses can learn the prosodic pattern of moth-
er’s speech.
In this section, we discussed how musical functions could assist language acqui-
sition by reviewing empirical evidence on the developmental course of these abili-
ties. We focused especially on the perception of rhythm and frequency structure and 
examined whether there are any parallels between the developmental courses of 
these abilities in the musical and linguistic domains.

12.3.1  Perception of Frequency Structure
12.3.1.1  Musical Chord and Formant Perception
In musical chord perception, the auditory system must analyse the relationship 
among f0 of simultaneously played musical notes. The difference of one-semitone in 
one note comprising a chord changes the perceived quality of a musical chord, from 
major to minor chords or vice versa. Further, adherence to certain mathematical 
rules creates a consonant chord, while violation of it results in a dissonant one.
There has been a debate over the innateness of chord processing ability, espe-
cially whether the preference for consonance over dissonance is acquired through 
cultural assimilation. Empirical studies generally favour the innateness of conso-
nant chord preferences (Masataka, 2006). A functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) study revealed differential activation of the newborn’s brain in response to 
consonant and dissonant chords (Perani et al., 2010). An event-related potential 
(ERP) study indicated that newborns could discriminate between a consonant and 
dissonant as well as between major and minor chords (Virtala et al., 2013). These 
findings indicate that the infant brain is innately endowed with the capacity to anal-
yse the pitch relationship of multiple sounds being played simultaneously.
The formant structure in vowel sounds has some resemblance to the spectral 
structure in musical chords. In vowel categorization, the auditory system must anal-
yse the peak frequencies of at least three formants simultaneously. Since everyone 
has different exposure to f0 depending on their gender, age, and height, the formant 
frequencies of identical vowel sounds differ among individuals. Despite this, identi-
cal vowels uttered by different individuals are perceived as such, a phenomenon 
called speaker invariance. Thus, what counts in vowel perception is the analysis of 
the relationship among formant frequencies rather than the absolute values of each 
formant frequency.
Behavioural studies on infant vowel categorization have shown that even neo-
nates can discriminate between different vowel sounds (Cheour-Luhtanen et al., 
1995). Vowel categorization is tuned by postnatal exposure to the mother tongue. 
Interestingly, some studies even argue that the tuning process starts in the womb 
(Moon et  al., 2013). Therefore, as in the case of musical chord perception, the 
nascent ability of formant perception functions from the very initial stage of 
development.
12.3.1.2  Melody and Pitch Contour Perception
Melodic contour is created by the temporal sequence of musical notes f0. Melody 
will sound the same when the notes are transposed or played in different keys 
(Mottron et al., 2009). This illustrates that the primary determinant of musical mel-
ody is not the absolute value of pitch but the contour of the temporal sequence of 
relative pitches that unfolds as the music is played.

Studies on the early development of melodic perception have shown that infants 
as young as 5–10 months old can detect violations of melodic contour irrespective 
of transposition (Trehub & Hannon, 2006). Plantinga and Trainor (2009) showed 
that even 2-month-olds could discriminate melodies of different songs, although the 
musical materials used in this study were not well controlled for low-level auditory 
features.
It is widely acknowledged that infants use pitch contour as a cue to analyse the 
grammatical structure. One example is the use of lexical stress in word segmenta-
tion (Jusczyk, 1999). Lexical stress is characterized by high pitch, long duration, 
large amplitude, and vowel quality. Among these acoustic cues, the human auditory 
system is quite sensitive to pitch change; humans can discriminate lexical stress 
patterns (trochaic or iambic) of nonsense syllables based on pitch-cue alone 
(Hoeschele & Fitch, 2016). Infants as young as 8 months can use lexical stress cues 
for segmenting sound streams into words (Jusczyk, 1999). In English-speaking 
countries, infants usually segment sound streams into units with strong-weak stress 
patterns. However, the 7-month-olds in Thiessen and Saffran’s (2007) study 
switched this stress-based strategy and started extracting words with weak-strong 
(iambic) stress patterns after repeated exposure to word sequences of the iambic 
stress pattern. Thus, infants can flexibly modify their stress-based word-­segmentation 
strategy through experience.
Another well-studied example is infants’ use of pitch contour information as a 
cue for boundary detection. In speech, boundaries between phrases and clauses are 
often marked by pitch change and a long duration of syllables followed by a brief 
pause, which is observed cross-linguistically. Infants as young as 6 months have 
been shown to rely heavily on prosodic pattern for boundary detection (Seidl, 2007). 
Wellmann et al. (2012) investigated the acoustic characteristics that 8-month-old 
infants rely on in boundary detection. Pitch change or long duration alone were not 
sufficient for infants to detect a phrase boundary. However, the combination of long 
duration and pitch change enabled infants to find boundaries without pause cues. 
Similar results have been obtained in 6-month-olds as well (Seidl, 2007).
These studies indicate the primary importance of pitch contour in linguistic 
sound in order for human infants to be able to segment grammatical units. 
Interestingly, these studies revealed the emergence of the ability to use pitch contour 
in sound segmentation around 6–10 months (Thiessen & Saffran, 2007; Seidl, 2007; 
Wellmann et al., 2012), which roughly corresponds to the age when infants acquire 
the ability to process melodic contour (Trehub & Hannon, 2006). Comparisons of 
the developmental courses of pitch change in musical and linguistic materials also 
support a domain-general pattern of development (Chen et al., 2017). Indeed, such 
coincidence alone should not be deemed as definitive evidence, but it is quite con-
ceivable that the maturation of identical neural mechanisms underlies the develop-
ment of the ability to process pitch contour in both musical and linguistic materials.
Infants’ sensitivity to pitch contour is effectively used in parental vocalizations 
directed towards infants. When talking to infants, adults modify their manner of 
speech so it differs from speech that is used with adults (Kuhl, 2007; Masataka, 
2003). Such infant-directed speech is mainly characterized by high-pitch and 
12  Beyond the Language Module: Musicality as a Stepping Stone Towards Language…

264
exaggerated intonation (Doi, 2020). High-pitched voice is effective in grabbing an 
infant’s attention, possibly due to its emotional connotation (Corbeil et al., 2013). 
Likewise, exaggerated intonation makes it easier for infants to extract pitch contour, 
which assists infants in word segmentation and boundary detection. Thus, the 
domain-general ability of relative pitch perception as well as social input provided 
in infant-directed speech interactively scaffold infants’ language acquisition (Doi, 
2020; Sulpizio et al., 2018).
12.3.2  Rhythm Perception
Rhythm perception can be both objective and subjective (Iversen et al., 2009). A 
strong beat is often marked by large sound amplitude. At the same time, people 
sometimes perceive strong and weak beats in the repetition of monotonous sounds 
without any acoustic marks.
Rhythmicity in synchronized bodily movement is observed in as early as the 
neonatal stage, which is thought to reflect the activity of the central pattern genera-
tor. As for the perception of musical rhythm, an ERP study by Winkler et al. (2009) 
showed evidence of beat perception in neonates. In their study, neonates were 
exposed to a sequence of percussion sounds with a hierarchical metric structure. 
They were repeatedly exposed to standard sounds that lacked sound at a weak beat 
location. Within the sequence of standard sounds, the target sound, in which sound 
was omitted at a strong beat (downbeat) location, was presented with low frequency. 
They focused on a newborn’s homologue of mismatch negativity (MMN). MMN is 
an ERP component usually elicited by deviant auditory sound that is presented with 
low frequency, embedded within a sequence of standard sounds. MMN is elicited 
even when a subject is not directing attention to the sounds. Thus, MMN is accepted 
as a reliable indicator of the ability to discriminate deviant and standard sound at the 
pre-attentive perceptual stage. The main finding of Winkler et al. (2009) was that the 
target sound elicited MMN in neonates, indicating that even neonates can discrimi-
nate weak and strong beats.
The innate ability of beat perception prepares infants to process rhythmic struc-
tures in incoming auditory information. This ability is shaped further by postnatal 
exposure to environmental sounds. Folk music of Eastern European countries such 
as Bulgaria and Macedonia has a complex metrical structure that differs from the 
simple metric structure in Western music. Twelve-month-olds reared in the United 
States, who probably had almost no experience of hearing music with a complex 
metre, could not detect slight changes in complex metres of Eastern European folk 
music (Hannon & Trehub, 2005b), while 6-month-old infants could (Hannon & 
Trehub, 2005a). In phoneme perception, the neural system is plastically tuned to 
process phoneme categories in mother tongues through postnatal experience, while 
losing the ability to discriminate phoneme categories that do not exist in the mother 
tongue (Kuhl et al., 2011). Likewise, infants lose their ability to discriminate unfa-
miliar types of faces, e.g. faces of different species and unfamiliar races (Pascalis 
H. Doi and N. Masataka

265
et al., 2002). The studies by Hannon and Trehub (Hannon & Trehub, 2005a, b) 
indicate that a similar process of perceptual tuning is at work in the development of 
musical rhythm; infants lose their ability to process unfamiliar rhythmic structure 
through postnatal exposure to their musical culture.
Linguists have raised the possibility that languages can be classified into several 
families according to their rhythmic structure, e.g. stress- and syllable-timed lan-
guages (Nazzi & Ramus, 2003). In stress-timed languages, such as English, the 
timing of the successive stressed locations in utterances are kept fairly constant, 
while in syllable-timed languages, such as French and Italian, syllables are uttered 
with constant timing. Nazzi et al. (1998) tested whether neonates could discriminate 
unfamiliar low-pass filtered foreign languages. Low-pass filtering eliminates high-­
frequency components of linguistics sound. Consequently, phonemic information is 
almost lost in low-pass filtered language, which makes it impossible for infants to 
use phoneme distribution as a clue to discriminate two languages. Interestingly, 
neonates in this study could discriminate unfamiliar foreign languages in different 
rhythmic families but not in the same rhythmic family. Thus, infants can detect 
rhythmic structures in languages as well as in music from the neonatal stage.
Nazzi and Ramus (2003) proposed the rhythm bootstrapping hypothesis, which 
proposes that human infants rely on rhythmic structure in language as a clue to seg-
ment grammatical units. Adults who speak syllable-timed languages use segmenta-
tion strategies in online language processing which differ from those of individuals 
whose mother tongue is a stress-timed language (Cutler et al., 1986). Therefore, 
speakers of both syllable- and stress-timed languages adopt a word segmentation 
strategy suited to their mother tongue. Lexical stress often signals the onset of a 
single word in English, but stress is less likely to be a marker of a word boundary in 
syllable-timed languages. Such language-specificity in word-segmentation strate-
gies presents infant with a problem of deciding which acoustic cue to rely on in 
word segmentation. The rhythmic bootstrapping hypothesis suggests that the rhyth-
mic structure of language gives infants a clue to discover the most efficient strategy, 
syllable- or stress-based, in word segmentation.
Most evidence for rhythm bootstrapping comes from studies on infants in an 
English-speaking environment. The aforementioned studies on infants learning 
English show that infants as young as 8 months segment words by lexical stress 
(Jusczyk, 1999; Thiessen & Saffran, 2007). Further, when the cues of transition 
probability and lexical stress are incongruent, 9-month-old infants treat lexical 
stress as a primary cue over transition probability in word segmentation (Thiessen 
& Saffran, 2007). As for syllable-timed languages, Nazzi et al. (2006) reported that 
French infants segmented words using a syllable-based strategy. These results, 
together with the early emergence of the domain-general ability to perceive rhyth-
mic structure (Nazzi et al., 1998; Winkler et al., 2009), provide partial support to the 
rhythm bootstrapping hypothesis. The reason remains elusive why human infants, 
who are innately endowed with the ability of rhythm processing (Winkler et al., 
2009), do not show evidence of language-specific segmentation strategies until 
around 8 months. One possible reason is that infants do not learn to associate per-
ceived rhythmic structure with word segmentation strategy until around this age.

12.4  Evolutionary Roots of Musicality and Its Relationship 
with Language
Perceptual systems recruited in music processing can be used to analyse the linguis-
tic stream and grasp its grammatical structure. The parallel development of corre-
sponding functions in the musical and linguistic domains indicates the possibility 
that the maturation of domain-general functions recruited in both music and lan-
guage processing assist language acquisition in human infants. This line of reason-
ing further raises the possibility that the evolution of musical functions has prepared 
the basis of the evolution of language in humans.
The burgeoning ability, or precursors, of music processing can be seen in birds, 
rodents, and non-human primates as well (Doi, 2020). However, their musicality 
does not match that of humans in its refinement. Considering this, the gap in musi-
cality between humans and non-human species might constitute part of the reason 
why only humans have a sophisticated ability for language processing and speech 
communication. This section reviews the existing findings on musical abilities in 
non-human species and discusses the evolution of language from the perspective of 
phylogenetic roots of musicality.
12.4.1  Frequency Structure Perception
12.4.1.1  Analysis of Musical Chords and Vowel Formants
Chord perception and vowel categorization require the ability to grasp the relation-
ships of peak frequencies. Interestingly, behavioural and electrophysiological stud-
ies have revealed close similarity in musical chord perception between non-human 
primates and humans (Izumi, 2000). For example, Fishman et al. (2001) measured 
electrophysiological responses in neurons of the primary auditory region in macaque 
monkeys and humans to dissonant and consonant chords. This study revealed that 
neurons in homologous regions in macaque monkeys’ and humans’ brains represent 
dissonance levels of musical chords.
Instrumental and vocal sounds contain harmonics of f0. Here, harmonic means 
sound with the frequency of integer-multiple of f0. When a sound composed of har-
monics of the same f0 is presented, one perceives a sound with the f0, even when the 
sound lacks spectral peak in f0. This phenomenon, called missing fundamental, is 
deemed as the expression of the superb ability of the human auditory system to 
analyse harmonic structure, and human infants as young as 3 months old show signs 
of missing fundamental perception (He & Trainor, 2009). Bendor and Wang (2005) 
measured activations of frequency-sensitive neurons, neurons that are activated by 
sound with specific frequency, in the auditory cortex in marmosets. They found a set 
of neurons that were activated by both pure tone with f0 and the sound composed of 
harmonics of f0 without spectral peak in f0. These findings indicate that marmosets 
H. Doi and N. Masataka

267
possess the ability to analyse fundamental frequency in complex harmonic sound. 
Behavioural studies have revealed the ability to perceive missing fundamentals in 
other species as well (Cynx & Shapiro, 1986; Heffner & Whitfield, 1976).
These electrophysiological and behavioural studies (Bendor & Wang, 2005; 
Fishman et al., 2001) indicate that the basic functions for analysing the relationships 
of peak frequencies are phylogenetically old. Considering the spectral similarity 
between vowel formants and musical chords, it is possible that non-human species 
also possess the basic ability of vowel categorization. Direct evidence for vowel 
categorization has been obtained in several species (Hienz et al., 1981, 1996; Ohms 
et al., 2010). Among these species, songbirds show the most prominent resemblance 
to humans in their ability to categorize phonemes. Ohms et al. (2010) found that 
zebra finches could learn to discriminate vowels and generalize this discrimination 
to vowel sounds uttered by opposite-sex speakers despite the difference in the abso-
lute height of formant frequencies. Thus, the findings of Ohms et al. (2010) support 
the view that zebra finches can analyse the relative relationship of formant frequen-
cies in a manner closely similar to that of humans.
12.4.1.2  Analysis of Pitch Contour
In ecological settings, animals transmit many messages by modifying their vocal-
izations either voluntarily or involuntarily. A well-known example is the innate 
association between arousal level and high-pitched voice. In a highly aroused state, 
vocal folds vibrate at a higher frequency, which generates voices with higher f0 in 
many mammalian species including humans (Bachorowski, 1999; Filippi et  al., 
2019; Kamiloğlu et al., 2020). In addition to the absolute height of f0, a substantial 
number of studies have revealed that context-dependent messages and emotional 
states are encoded in the pitch contour in animal vocalizations (Briefer, 2012; 
Filippi et al., 2019). Therefore, the ability to analyse pitch contour must have been 
essential for survival.
The neural system must extract the temporal course of pitch change irrespective 
of the absolute pitch in the perception of pitch contour. Independence of absolute 
pitch and pitch contour perception is well illustrated in a phenomenon called octave-­
generalization which states that melodies sound the same when transposed by an 
octave. Absolute pitches of all musical notes change after transposition. Despite 
this, the human auditory system perceives an identical melody after transposition, 
which indicates strong reliance on the pitch contour, or relative pitch change, in 
melody processing (Mottron et al., 2009). A study by Wright et al. (2000) tested 
octave generalizations of musical chords in rhesus monkeys. Their main finding was 
that the monkeys showed signs of octave-generalization; the monkeys perceived the 
identical tune played in different octaves to be the same when tonal music was used 
as the musical material. Thus, similar to humans, rhesus monkeys also rely heavily 
on pitch contour rather than absolute pitch in perceiving sound sequence.
In songbirds, Spierings and ten Cate (2014) revealed that zebra finches treat pro-
sodic patterns more heavily than structural cues in discriminating multisyllabic 
12  Beyond the Language Module: Musicality as a Stepping Stone Towards Language…

268
sequences. Among three stress cues manipulated, i.e., pitch contour, amplitude, and 
duration, pitch was the most salient one to the songbirds, indicating the basic ability 
to discriminate rising and falling pitch contour in this species. The same group also 
showed that zebra finches could learn to discriminate trochaic and iambic stress pat-
terns by pitch cue alone, but not by duration and sound amplitude cues (Spierings 
et al., 2017), showing the prominence of pitch contour in stress detection in zebra 
finches.
The number of laboratory studies reporting pitch contour perception ability in 
non-human species is relatively small, compared to studies on musical chord and 
formant perception (Fishman et al., 2001; Hienz et al., 1981, 1996; Izumi, 2000; 
Ohms et al., 2010). This could be because the analysis of pitch contour might be 
actually more difficult for non-human species than chord and formant perception; 
the analysis of the temporal course of pitch change requires additional functions, 
such as working memory, compared to the analysis of pitch relationships among 
simultaneously played sounds. At the same time, the prevalent use of pitch contour 
in the wild (Briefer, 2012; Filippi et al., 2019) indicates that lack of ecological valid-
ity in laboratory settings might have prevented researchers from finding signs of 
pitch contour perception in the laboratory (see Hoeschele et al., 2014, for similar 
discussion).
12.4.2  Rhythm Perception
Rhythm perception is closely linked to motoric functions. Indeed, human fMRI 
studies revealed activation of motoric regions, such as the premotor area and basal 
ganglia, in rhythm and beat perception (Grahn & Brett, 2007). When listening to 
ambient music, humans spontaneously make bodily movements in tune with the 
perceived beat of the music. Spontaneous entrainment to rhythm is ubiquitously 
observed in humans but is relatively rare among non-human species (Patel et al., 
2009; Schachner et al., 2009). Even in those species showing signs of rhythmic 
entrainment, the temporal precision of their movement is far lower than that of 
humans (Hattori & Tomonaga, 2020; Patel et al., 2009).
Lack of spontaneous entrainment to rhythm does not necessarily mean the lack 
of ability to produce and perceive rhythmic patterns. The production of rhythmic 
patterns is often tested by the synchronization-continuation task (SCT). In SCT, an 
animal is first required to make bodily movements, usually tapping movement, in 
synchrony with an auditory or visual stimulus appearing at constant intervals (syn-
chronization phase). In the continuation phase, external stimulation is eliminated 
and the subject must continue making bodily movements at the same pace as the 
synchronization phase.
An electrophysiological study using the SCT paradigm found a subgroup of neu-
rons representing action timing in the medial premotor cortex of rhesus monkeys 
(Merchant et al., 2011). The firing rate of one group of neurons changed according 
to the elapsed time from the last action, while the other group of neurons 
H. Doi and N. Masataka

269
represented the remaining time until the next action. Thus, there are several systems 
for time keeping in the brain of rhesus monkeys, enabling them to make externally 
and internally paced actions.
However, the ability to make rhythmic movements in rhesus monkeys is not the 
same as that in humans. Zarco et al. (2009) compared the behaviour in SCT between 
rhesus monkeys and humans. After training, rhesus monkeys learned to make paced 
movements, but detailed analysis revealed substantial differences in the pattern of 
action timing between rhesus monkeys and humans. First, humans made the actions 
synchronously with or slightly ahead of external stimulation, indicating anticipatory 
preparation of timed-action. In contrast, the action timing of rhesus monkeys lagged 
behind external stimulation, though the action timing was faster than that in the 
serial reaction time task. Second, the variance of action timing was drastically larger 
during continuation than in the synchronization phase in rhesus monkeys at long 
intervals, but no such trend was found in humans. These findings raise the possibil-
ity that the mechanism for generating internally timed movements in rhesus mon-
keys is qualitatively different from that in humans.
Regarding the purely perceptual aspect of rhythm processing, Honing et  al. 
(2012) measured MMN-homologue elicited by deviant stimuli in rhesus macaques 
using the same paradigm as Winkler et al. (2009). As explained above, a deviant 
sound sequence, in which sound is omitted at the downbeat location, elicits MMN 
in human newborns. However, the same stimuli did not reliably elicit MMN-like 
responses in rhesus macaques, indicating a lack of beat perception in this species.
Though several avian species show rhythmic patterns in their vocalizations, there 
are only mixed results on the ability of these species to perceive rhythmic structure 
(ten Cate & Spierings, 2019). European starlings are reported to be capable of dis-
criminating rhythmic and arrhythmic patterns (Hulse et  al., 1984). Pigeons are 
reported to show the ability to discriminate different metric structures only under 
severely limited conditions (Hagmann & Cook, 2010).
12.5  Evolutionary Roots of Language from the Perspectives 
of Musicality
Many species, including songbirds and non-human primates, show human-like abil-
ities of frequency structure perception. Some species can apply this ability to pro-
cess materials taken from human language (Hoeschele & Fitch, 2016; Ohms et al., 
2010; Spierings & ten Cate, 2014). Further, cotton-top tamarins and rats are reported 
to be capable of discriminating unfamiliar languages based on prosodic cues (Ramus 
et al., 2000; Toro et al., 2003). Considering these, it seems likely that phylogeneti-
cally old functions are recruited in both music processing and prosodic bootstrap-
ping of language acquisition in human infants in a domain-general manner.
In contrast to the cross-species prevalence of frequency structure perception 
(Briefer, 2012; Filippi et al., 2019; Fishman et al., 2001; Wright et al., 2000), few 
12  Beyond the Language Module: Musicality as a Stepping Stone Towards Language…

270
species show the ability to perceive and produce rhythmic patterns. To obtain a full 
picture of the evolutionary roots of prosodic bootstrapping in language acquisition, 
it should be clarified how only humans acquired sophisticated rhythmic abilities. 
This is still a contentious field of debate, but we summarize below a tentative sce-
nario based on existing evidence.
Schachner et al. (2009) analysed the characteristics of species that show signs of 
rhythmic entrainment and claimed that most of the species capable of rhythmic 
entrainment are also vocal learners/imitators, species that possess the ability to 
mimic and reproduce environmental sounds and conspecific vocalizations (Egnor & 
Hauser, 2004). Because both rhythmic entrainment and vocal learning require a 
linkage between auditory and motor systems, Patel proposed that increased func-
tional and anatomical linkages between motor and auditory regions underlie the 
evolution of both vocal learning and rhythmic entrainment (Patel, 2014; Patel & 
Iversen, 2014). Songbirds, primates, dolphins, elephants, and bats use vocal imita-
tion for authenticating group membership, territorial defence, adjustment of social 
relationships, and courtship behaviour (Coleman et al., 2007; Doi, 2020). Thus, 
refinement of vocal learning/imitation, hence the development of auditory-motor 
coupling, had conferred clear adaptive benefits to these species.
Ethnographic research on existing hunter-gatherer societies indicates the pri-
mary roles of vocal imitation in cooperative behaviour (Boyd, 2018; Lewis, 2014). 
Accumulation and sharing of knowledge about the surrounding environment among 
group members increase the odds of survival. Initiated males of the Bakaya Pygmy 
group achieve this by narrating their experience and knowledge through multimodal 
channels, including sophisticated imitation of environmental sounds as well as ges-
tures and facial expressions (Lewis, 2014). Therefore, representing external entities 
by mimetic sound might have served as an efficient tool of communication in Homos 
throughout evolutionary history (Boyd, 2018). The adaptive benefit of sound-­
mimicking ability must have led to a closer and stronger coupling between motor 
and auditory regions in the human brain.
Though somewhat speculative, auditory-motor coupling may have paved the 
way for the emergence of fine-motor control of the vocal apparatus required in 
speech communication (Kearney & Guenther, 2019). The evolution of language 
made auditory-motor coupling even more valuable for humans, further strengthen-
ing the anatomical and functional association between these neural regions. In other 
words, auditory-motor coupling underlying the refinement of vocal learning/imita-
tion prepared the basis for the evolution of speech communication. Thereafter, the 
survival benefit of language and speech communication in turn strengthened this 
coupling further.
The evolution of tight auditory-motor coupling (Rauschecker & Scott, 2009) has 
been driven first by the survival benefit of vocal learning/imitation and then speech 
communication. As a by-product of this process, humans have acquired superb abil-
ity for rhythm processing. Interestingly, neuroimaging studies indicate that motoric 
regions as well as auditory cortices contribute to the perception of rhythmic (Grahn 
& Brett, 2007) and prosodic information (Brown & Martinez, 2007; Reiterer et al., 
2007; Belyk et al., 2016). Further, several studies revealed an association between 
H. Doi and N. Masataka

271
the strength of auditory-motor coupling and linguistic processing ability (Yu et al., 
2017). Thus, it seems to be the case that the human brain found a way to utilize 
strong auditory-motor coupling to process acoustic information and hence bootstrap 
language acquisition during infancy.
12.6  Conclusion
Human infants are faced with the daunting task of analysing the underlying struc-
ture of linguistic sound streams. Due to the lack of any language-specific knowl-
edge, linguistic sounds must be almost indistinguishable from music for infants. 
Therefore, it is natural to think that infants first apply their ability for musical pro-
cessing to linguistic materials.
Indeed, existing studies point to the possibility that domain-general abilities of 
frequency structure and rhythm perception contribute to language acquisition dur-
ing early infancy. Infants start applying these abilities to analyse linguistic sound 
streams almost coincidentally with the emergence of corresponding abilities in the 
musical domain. Such cross-domain similarity in the developmental course pro-
vides partial support for the view that domain-general functions assist language 
acquisition. However, this view should be validated empirically by future studies 
that investigate whether identical neural structures are recruited in processing musi-
cal and linguistic materials in prelinguistic infants.
The abilities for musical chord and pitch contour perception can be seen in many 
non-human species. Further, the species can apply these perceptual functions to 
analyse linguistic materials as well. In contrast, animals do not match humans in 
their ability to perceive and produce rhythmic patterns. Considering these, what 
separates humans from non-human species in terms of language evolution seems to 
be the emergence of tight coupling between auditory and motor regions in humans 
that engendered both speech communication and refined rhythmic ability.
The emergence of language made auditory-motor coupling more beneficial for 
humans. The strong auditory-motor coupling has brought up musical and linguistic 
abilities to even higher levels in humans, thereby enabling infants to use these 
domain-general functions to analyse linguistic sound streams in the process of lan-
guage acquisition.

What Is Unique in Infant Thinking About 
Others? Infant Social Cognition 
from an Evolutionary Perspective
David Buttelmann
Based on the idea that the mental abilities of all beings were subject to evolutionary 
continuity (Darwin, 1859, 1871), this chapter explores the uniqueness of human 
infant social cognition. Focusing on infants in this regard makes sense, because as 
soon as children reach preschool age, most tasks they are presented with in order to 
evaluate their social-cognitive abilities involve verbal responses and require sophis-
ticated levels of other cognitive abilities such as attention and memory (see specific 
sections below). Thus, my approach is to compare human infant social cognition to 
that of our closest relatives, the nonhuman great apes  – chimpanzees, bonobos, 
gorillas, and orangutans. This comparison is the most fruitful given that great apes 
are closely related to humans phylogenetically. The high degree of genetic related-
ness (Homo sapiens and members of the species Pan share between 98.3% and 
98.7% of their DNA; e.g., Wildman et al., 2003) suggests that differences in other 
areas, such as cognition, might also be smaller than expected.
In this chapter, I summarize empirical findings on human infants and great apes 
for their understanding of the mental states of goals, intentions, desires, and beliefs, 
examining whether human infants and great apes share an understanding of the 
mental state in question. If we identify a social-cognitive ability that only human 
infants possess but other great apes lack, this might be the key to human uniqueness 
and, consequently, a hint toward which abilities evolved specifically in humans and 
equipped our species with the tool kit needed to cooperate and build the kind of 
sophisticated culture we see in modern humans.
Reading others’ mental states helps individuals to explain and interpret others’ 
behavior (Premack & Woodruff, 1978), and, in consequence, to regulate one’s own 
intentional actions in accordance to the mental states underlying others’ actions. 
Thus, understanding that others act according to how they represent the current (and 
future) world equips individuals with a tremendous advantage. Although several

authors have claimed that humans are unique in how they deal with others’ psycho-
logical states compared to all other animals (e.g., see Call & Tomasello, 2008; 
Povinelli et al., 2000; Tomasello & Rakoczy, 2003), in recent years comparative 
research has demonstrated that humans might not be the only species that discerns 
what others perceive, intend, desire, and believe when reasoning about others.
13.1  Understanding of Others’ Desires
The term desire has been used differently by different authors (e.g., Repacholi & 
Gopnik, 1997; Schult, 2002; Searle, 1983). What all explanations have in common 
is that desires are considered mental states that cause people to act to bring about 
changes in the world. Following Repacholi and Gopnik’s (1997) use of the term 
“desire,” it could easily be exchanged with other terms that describe an individual’s 
attitude toward outside entities (e.g., the term “preferences”). Such use allows us to 
differentiate desires from goals. At least in humans, an individual’s desire typically 
is reflected by emotional expressions (e.g., a happy face when liking an object).
13.1.1  Understanding Others’ Desires in Human Infants
The development of infants’ understanding of emotional expressions seems to start 
early in ontogeny. By 4 months of age, human infants discriminate between some 
facial expressions such as fear and happiness (Nelson, 1987). Repacholi (1998) 
tested 14-month-olds’ understanding of emotional expressions and found that the 
infants understood both the directedness and the valence of emotional signals. In 
this study, infants saw an adult approach two boxes, open each one in turn, and show 
an emotional expression according to the content of each box (either happiness or 
disgust). When handed both boxes afterward, the infants correctly interpreted the 
available emotional expressions which was shown by them, predominantly opening 
the box to which the adult had responded with a happy expression.
By 18 months of age, infants understand that an individual’s emotional expres-
sion toward an object can be considered an indicator of the individual’s desire (for 
this particular object). In their study, Repacholi and Gopnik (1997) showed that 
18-month-old infants, after viewing an adult’s emotional responses to different food 
items, responded to the adult’s ambiguous request gesture by handing over her pre-
ferred food item even when it did not match their own preference. They thus dem-
onstrated that 18-month-old infants understand that desires are mental states 
underlying behavior and action. Specifically, infants at this age – but not 14-month-­
olds – have a non-egocentric understanding of the differences between their own 
desires and those of others.

13.1.2  Understanding Others’ Desires in Nonhuman 
Great Apes
Nonhuman great apes have shown some ability to discriminate the emotional states 
of conspecifics (Parr et al., 1998) and are also able to match videos with emotional 
content (e.g., a conspecific being injected) to the appropriate conspecific facial 
expression (Parr, 2001). Apes thus can differentiate emotional expressions. Only a 
little research has investigated their understanding that emotional expressions reflect 
internal states (i.e., desires) directed referentially to outside entities. In one study 
(Buttelmann et  al., 2009a, Exp. 1), behavioral settings previously presented to 
infants were modified and presented to great apes of all four species. As in Repacholi 
(1998), the authors had an experimenter emote neutrally or with disgust to the con-
tent of one box and with a happy emotional expression to the content of another box. 
At least for disgust versus happiness, the apes significantly preferred the box associ-
ated with the happy expression. Although this does not yet demonstrate that the apes 
considered emotional expressions as indicators for desires, it at least demonstrates 
an understanding of the valence and directedness of emotional expressions. To 
check whether apes indeed chose the happy box and did not just avoid the disgust 
box, and to see whether the apes used emotional expressions to infer desires and to 
interpret consequent behavior, the authors modified Repacholi and Gopnik’s (1997) 
procedure (Exp. 3). First, the experimenter hid two high-value food items in each of 
two containers. He then emoted to the content of each of the two containers: to one 
with an expression of happiness and to the other with an expression of disgust. Out 
of apes’ view, he then took the food out of the “happy box” and pretended to eat. 
Thus, when subsequently given a choice between both containers, the apes had to 
choose the disgust box in order to retrieve a food item. Although the effect was not 
too big, this is what the apes did. This research indicates that non-human great apes, 
like human 18-month-olds, can use the experimenter’s emotional expression to infer 
his desire.
13.2  Understanding Others’ Goals
As with the term desire, the use of the term goal provoked several misunderstand-
ings (e.g., see Want & Harris, 2001). In general, there are two main ways this term 
is used in the developmental literature. On the one hand, authors talk about goals 
when referring to a certain state of the environment; i.e., a person’s desired result as 
a state in the world. On the other hand, the term goal is used as referring to an inter-
nal representation of this desired state in the world that guides a person’s behavior 
(Tomasello et al., 2005). Since this chapter deals with infants and nonhuman apes’ 
understanding of others’ mental states, the term “goal” refers to this mental repre-
sentation of the desired state in the world.

13.2.1  Understanding Others’ Goals in Human Infants
Understanding others’ intentional actions in terms of goals tells the observer what 
an organism is trying to do. Thus, this mental state derives from a desire and forms 
a more concrete representation that affects the organism’s behavior. Several types of 
tasks have been used to investigate goal understanding in human infancy. A very 
prominent task is the habituation-dishabituation paradigm that measures infants’ 
looking time at video scenes in which an actor acts according to his or her goal 
versus performs an action that is not directed at his or her goal. Using this paradigm, 
research has shown that human infants seem to understand others’ goals from a very 
early age. For example, Woodward (1998) presented 6-month-olds with an actor 
who repeatedly reached for one of two objects that were always positioned next to 
each other (with each object staying at the same position during familiarization). At 
test, the two objects were switched, and the actor reached either at the old object 
(following a new path) or followed her previous path but consequently reached for 
the alternative object. Results indicated that 6-month-olds understand others’ 
actions as object-directed: The infants looked at the scene longer when the actor 
reached for the alternative object (although the path was identical to the previous 
one) compared to when she reached for the old object (although she had to use a 
new path).
In related research, a number of subsequent studies have provided evidence that 
infants between 6.5 and 12 months already understand that agents pursue goals 
around obstacles (e.g., Csibra et al., 1999; Gergely et al., 1995). Watching a com-
puter screen, infants are habituated to an animate dot jumping over a wall and 
approaching another dot on the other side of this wall. When the wall is then 
removed in the test trial, infants seem to expect the dot to approach the other dot 
directly (e.g., horizontally, without a jump), which is interpreted from their longer 
looking times at the screen when the dot in the test trial continues the previous 
jumping action although it is now not necessary (violation of expectation).
Another clever task to measure whether human infants have an understanding of 
goal-directed actions is to investigate how they segment others’ actions (e.g., 
Baldwin et al., 2001; Saylor et al., 2007). Both on video and live, infants in the last 
quarter of their first year of life observed a human (or a human-like array of light 
dots) perform a continuous everyday action sequence. These action sequences were 
then interrupted, either at a point at which a goal-directed action was finished or at 
a point at which a goal-directed action was still in the process. What was measured 
was how long infants looked at these interruptions. Infants demonstrated their 
understanding of goal-directed actions when they looked longer at the interruptions 
when they stopped a goal-directed action from being fulfilled than at an interruption 
that appeared after a goal-directed action has been fulfilled.
Beginning in the second half of infants’ first year of life, their goal understanding 
starts to guide their behavior: 7-month-olds imitate an actor’s goal-directed actions 
in a differentiated manner. That is, they performed modeled actions only if these 
actions were goal-directed (Hamlin et al., 2008). Around their first birthdays, infants

use their understanding of others’ goals when imitatively learning from others and 
copying others’ actions selectively according to the others’ goals. In one series of 
studies, participants were presented with an experimenter performing two identical 
but differently marked actions on a novel apparatus. Infants tended to imitate the 
action that was vocally marked as intentional (e.g., by the word “There!”), whereas 
they ignored the same action when marked as an accident (e.g., by the word 
“Whoops!”) by the experimenter (e.g., Carpenter et al., 1998; Olineck & Poulin-­
Dubois, 2005). In another set of imitation studies, 18-month-old infants even imi-
tated an actor’s intended goal after they had only seen the actor’s failed attempt to 
achieve her goal (e.g., Bellagamba & Tomasello, 1999; Carpenter et  al., 2005; 
Meltzoff, 1995).
Finally, studies testing infants in interactive non-imitative settings found that at 
around their first birthdays, infants start to understand that others persist in pursuing 
their goals when they are not achieved, for example, in the case of failed attempts or 
accidents. For example, Behne et al. (2005) presented infants sitting at a table with 
an experimenter handing over objects to the participants in two different ways. 
Infants from 9 months of age onwards became more impatient (reaching, banging 
on the table, turning away) when the experimenter was unwilling to pass over the 
object, e.g., by holding it out and moving back in a teasing fashion, than when the 
experimenter was unable to do so, e.g., because he accidentally dropped it during 
the attempt to hand it over to the participant. Further, infants infer an actor’s goal 
when presented with referential gestures, such as gazing and pointing in combina-
tion with intentional reaches for or graspings of an object, with some studies also 
including emotional cues (see previous section) (e.g., Moses et al., 2001; Phillips 
et al., 2002; Sodian & Thoermer, 2004). Taken together, there is an abundance of 
experimental evidence that shows that human infants have a relatively complex 
understanding of others’ goals by around their first birthdays.
13.2.2  Understanding Others’ Goals in Nonhuman Great Apes
Studies investigating the understanding of others’ goals in great apes apply different 
types of paradigms. In the first kind of study investigating goal understanding in 
great apes, a human experimenter communicates the location of hidden food to the 
subject by using various gestures (e.g., head orientation, pointing at the container) 
to show the subject which of these containers is baited. Across different studies, 
great apes show variable performance. Some studies indicate that, despite their abil-
ity to follow a human’s gaze (Call et al., 1998), chimpanzees still fail to use human 
pointing or gazing cues in such tasks (e.g., Call & Tomasello, 1994; Itakura et al., 
1999; Tomasello et al., 1997). Other studies, however, indicate that chimpanzees, 
orangutans, and gorillas are all successful at using at least some of these cues, such 
as pointing, head and eye orientation, or a physical marker put intentionally on top 
of the baited container by the experimenter to locate hidden food (Barth et al., 2005; 
Byrnit, 2004; Call & Tomasello, 1998; Itakura & Tanaka, 1998; Miklósi & Soproni, 
13  What Is Unique in Infant Thinking About Others? Infant Social Cognition…

282
2006). However, it should be mentioned that in most cases when subjects did use 
these cues successfully, they first experienced extensive training where they might 
have learned the cues.
The fact that in this task subjects are presented with communicative cues such as 
pointing, tapping the container, or gazing in a cooperative setting might account for 
the apes’ failures to apply social cognition spontaneously (see also Herrmann et al., 
2007). While all of these communicative cues are common behaviors for humans, 
they may not normally be used between conspecifics in other primate species 
(Goodall, 1986; Menzel, 1973). Yet great apes may be able to interpret others’ goals 
when observing them act in a more non-cooperative context, such as food acquisi-
tion or food processing. Unlike communicative cues, such behavioral cues consist 
of fully functional behaviors and do not reflect the actor’s intent to communicate 
specific information to other individuals (Buttelmann et al., 2008a). Indeed, several 
studies involving more behavioral cues provide evidence for great apes’ ability to 
understand the actions of others in terms of the goals they are pursuing. For exam-
ple, although chimpanzees fail to retrieve the container with food in object-choice 
tasks that are set-up in a cooperative situation, i.e., when it was indicated by a com-
municative cue, they could successfully use a very similar behavioral cue to locate 
the hidden food in a competitive context, namely a human or conspecific reaching 
for the baited cup but not paying attention to the subject (Hare & Tomasello, 2004). 
Thus, even though both cues involve a very similar arm movement, subjects differ-
entiated these two cues. However, there are also mixed findings with non-­cooperative 
object-choice tasks. For instance, Bräuer et al. (2006) presented chimpanzees and 
bonobos with two behavioral cues: a cue in which the experimenter attempted to 
remove the lid from the baited cup, and the reaching cue from Hare and Tomasello 
(2004), and subjects failed to use these cues when choosing between locations. One 
important difference between this study and the one by Hare and Tomasello (2004) 
may account for the subjects’ failures in the reaching condition  – in Hare and 
Tomasello’s study the experimenter first established a competitive relationship with 
the subject before the cue was given; such a relationship was not established in the 
Bräuer et al. study. This competitive context may have especially motivated the 
subjects. We will later come back to this point.
As with children (e.g., Behne et al., 2005), some studies also used natural inter-
action paradigms to investigate great apes’ ability to understand others’ goals. For 
example, Call et al. (2004) had a human experimenter repeatedly give chimpanzees 
food through a glass panel. Then, on some trials, the experimenter did not give the 
food. The experimental manipulation was that sometimes the experimenter did not 
give food because he was unwilling to, whereas other times he did not give it 
because he was unable to do so. Unwillingness was expressed in one of three ways: 
the experimenter either simply stared at the food on the table in front of him without 
giving it, he ate it himself, or he teased the chimpanzee with it, pulling it back when 
the chimpanzee reached for it. Matched with each of these three unwilling actions 
were two unable actions that resembled fairly closely their counterpart behavior-
ally – with respect to how and where the food was moved and where the experi-
menter looked. The basic finding was that chimpanzees reacted similarly to the 
D. Buttelmann

283
different unwilling actions by expressing frustration and impatience, and they 
reacted similarly to the different unable actions by being patient (possibly because 
they inferred that the experimenter was “trying”). This similarity of reaction across 
the different manifestations of the two experimental conditions suggests that the 
chimpanzees understood the different goals of the experimenter in the different con-
ditions – regardless of how they were expressed behaviorally (see also Buttelmann 
et al., 2012, Study 1). In another interactive paradigm, Buttelmann et al. (2012, 
Study 2) had an experimenter feeding subjects at two feeding sites and changing 
sites from time to time. The subjects were free to move between sites, and the 
authors measured how fast the subjects left a site after the experimenter got up at 
this site. The manipulation was that sometimes the experimenter got up wanting to 
feed the subject at the other site, other times his getting up was caused by cues in the 
context (e.g., a walkie-talkie making noise). The apes left the feeding site slower 
when the experimenter had a different goal (e.g., to answer the walkie-talkie) than 
the goal to feed them.
Interestingly, chimpanzees also demonstrated their understanding of others’ 
goals in other types of interaction studies previously applied to human infants, that 
is, interactive tasks in which the measure was more prosocial. Using a helping para-
digm, Warneken and Tomasello (2006) had a human experimenter drop an object 
accidentally in the presence of each of three human-raised chimpanzees and then 
strain and reach toward it (with several different objects in several different situa-
tions). The chimpanzees retrieved it for him. Importantly, they did not retrieve it for 
him in various control conditions in which he threw the object away or otherwise 
indicated a lack of interest. The chimpanzees’ different behavior in the experimental 
and control conditions could be interpreted as indicating an understanding of the 
experimenter’s different goals in the two situations (see also Premack & Woodruff’s, 
1978, study with a single human-raised chimpanzee). Warneken et al. (2007) set up 
a much more novel situation in which one chimpanzee also might help a conspe-
cific. In this study, one chimpanzee was attempting to get into an adjoining room, 
often shaking the door in his attempt. Another chimpanzee then quite often, from 
her advantageous location, pulled a chain that unlocked the door so that the first 
chimpanzee could have access to the room he wanted to get into. They did this more 
in this condition than in a control condition in which the first chimpanzee was trying 
to get out another door. These studies of instrumental helping suggest that chimpan-
zees can tell when someone needs help achieving their goal.
Finally, Tomasello and Carpenter (2005) used two imitation paradigms (from 
research with human infants) with the same three human-raised, juvenile chimpan-
zees used in the Warneken and Tomasello (2006) study. In one paradigm, based on 
the study by Meltzoff (1995), a human tried but failed to perform various actions on 
objects. The chimpanzees successfully discerned the action the human was attempt-
ing to perform and performed it themselves (as often as when they had seen her 
perform it successfully, and more often than when she had just manipulated the 
object). In the other paradigm, based on the study by Carpenter et al. (1998), a 
human performed two actions on a series of apparatuses, one intentional and one 
accidental, before it was the chimpanzees’ turn. The human-raised chimpanzees 
13  What Is Unique in Infant Thinking About Others? Infant Social Cognition…

284
copied the intentional action more often than the accidental action (see also Call 
et al., 2005, and Myowa-Yamakoshi & Matsuzawa, 2000, for other studies of this 
with less clear results).
Taken together, these studies seem to be fairly convincing that human infants and 
great apes, chimpanzees in particular, understand others’ intentional actions in 
terms of their goals. For great apes, showing this ability seems boosted when observ-
ing them acting in a non-communicative manner. However, one might argue that in 
most of these studies, the (human) actor behaved slightly differently in the experi-
mental and control conditions (i.e., the slightly different behavior was the cue to the 
different underlying goals involved). This means that any one of these studies could 
be given an explanation in terms of behavioral rules – an association between an 
antecedent and a consequent behavior of the actor – that great apes are either born 
with or learn. In my view, this explanation is unlikely because of the novelty and 
diversity of behaviors used as both cues and responses in the great number of differ-
ent studies. In addition, in some of these studies (e.g., Buttelmann et al., 2012), the 
experimenter’s observable behavior at test was identical in all conditions.
13.3  Understanding Others’ Intentions
Understanding what state in the world an individual is trying to achieve is already 
helpful for explaining and interpreting the individual’s behavior. However, the 
explanatory power of this ability is very restricted given that in most situations there 
are several methods of how to obtain a specific goal. It is thus also important to 
understand others’ intentions. Understanding intentions in this chapter refers to an 
understanding of others’ action in terms of both a goal – an internal representation 
of the desired state in the world – in combination with a rationally chosen means 
(Bratman, 1989). Thus, an individual that understands others’ intentions has an idea 
of what the acting organism is trying to do and how it wants to achieve it. The cho-
sen action is rational since for the choice of a means, the person takes into account 
her knowledge and skills and her mental model of the current reality (Tomasello 
et al., 2005). Therefore, this choice is influenced by reasons (e.g., why the organism 
chooses a specific means). Some reasons for such a choice can be observed, others 
cannot (especially if these are mental as well, such as ignorance, see next section). 
Whereas goals can be fulfilled in different ways, intentions are characterized by 
what Searle calls causal self-referentiality (Searle, 1983). Intentions have to be car-
ried out actively as originally represented. Achieving the desired outcome in some 
other way does not fulfill the intention (Astington & Gopnik, 1991; Schult, 2002). 
When comparing intentions with desires, Bratman (1987) further argues that there 
is a greater commitment to action with an intention than with a desire. Unlike with 
desires, intentions have to be made consistent with each other due to this greater 
commitment. In addition, because a person commits herself to an action plan in 
order to form an intention, intentions are resistant to reconsideration (Bratman, 
1987, p. 18).

13.3.1  Understanding of Others’ Intentions in Human Infants
There is some evidence that infants understand others’ intentions around their first 
birthdays. Gergely et al. (2002) conducted a study in which 14-month-old infants 
watched an adult switch on a lamp with her forehead. For half of the infants the 
adult was forced to use this unusual means because her hands were occupied (she 
was holding a blanket around her shoulders; Hands-Occupied condition). The other 
half of the infants saw the adult use the same unusual means even though she could 
have more easily used her hands, which were not occupied (Hands-Free condition). 
When later given the possibility to act on the lamp themselves (with no constraints), 
more infants reproduced the adult’s unusual action when her hands had been free 
(69%) than when they had been occupied (21%). The most mentalistic interpreta-
tion of this result (Buttelmann et al., 2008b) is that in the Hands-Free condition, 
infants apparently understood that the adult must have chosen the unusual action for 
some reason (even if they did not know exactly what that reason was), and they 
copied the action in order to find out what that reason might have been. In the 
Hands-Occupied condition, in contrast, the adult’s reason for choosing that action 
was clear – her hands were constrained – and, since infants were not constrained in 
this way, they did not copy the action. Since the model’s goal was identical in both 
conditions (i.e., to illuminate the lamp), this study shows that infants took into 
account other aspects besides behavior, namely environmental variables, to identify 
the model’s intentions.
Subsequent research has made three important extensions to the original head-­
touch study. First, a study including the imitation of the use or choice of a tool to 
obtain a reward replicated the head-touch finding conceptually (Buttelmann et al., 
2008b). In this study, a model either had to use a tool because the direct access to 
the reward was blocked by a physical barrier or he freely decided to use the tool 
although direct access was available (mirroring the Hands-Occupied and the Hands-­
Free conditions). In a set of two studies, 14-month-old infants used the tool them-
selves more often in the not-blocked than in the blocked condition. In a third study, 
the model had to use a tool in both conditions. In the not-blocked condition, he 
could freely choose between a rather unusual tool for pulling (i.e., a wooden block) 
or a tool usually associated with pulling (i.e., a rope), while in the blocked condi-
tion, he had access to the unusual tool only. The infants imitated the use of the 
unusual tool more often in the not-blocked than in the blocked condition. Another 
study had 12-month-olds watch as an adult made a toy animal enter a toy house 
through the chimney instead of the door – either while access through the door was 
blocked or while access through the door was possible (Schwier et al., 2006). Even 
these younger infants made the toy animal enter the house through the chimney 
more often in the door-not-blocked than in the door-blocked condition. Thus, infants 
make use of their intention understanding not only in body-part imitation tasks but 
in different types of imitation tasks.
Secondly, using two types of body-part-imitation tasks (i.e., head-touch and sit-­
touch), Géllen and Buttelmann (2017) tested 14-month-olds in a within-subjects 
13  What Is Unique in Infant Thinking About Others? Infant Social Cognition…

286
design. The infants flexibly alternated their imitative response in accordance with a 
model’s changing physical constraints, demonstrating their ability to adapt their 
intention understanding in the light of the model’s physical constraints.
Third, two very recent studies made the most important extension of the head-­
touch experiment given the topic of this chapter by attempting to test the mentalistic 
account described above. Both studies presented 14-month-olds with a model per-
forming the exact same unusual action (e.g., a head touch) in two conditions. What 
differed between conditions was whether or not the model was mentally – instead of 
physically – constrained. More specifically, while the model knew that the unusual 
action was unnecessary and that there was a much more efficient action to achieve 
the goal (e.g., hand use) in the knowledgeable condition (mirroring the hands-free 
condition), in the ignorant condition (mirroring the hands-occupied condition) the 
model was ignorant about this fact. Thus, if infants paid attention to the model’s 
knowledge state, they might differ in their response just as they did when being 
presented with physical constraints. The infants – who always knew of the efficient 
means either from observing an assistant or from self-experience – differed in their 
imitative response behavior as hypothesized in both a body-part imitation task 
(Géllen & Buttelmann, 2021) and in an action-on-object task (Buttelmann et al., 
2021a). Thus, although all observable parameters of the model’s demonstration 
were identical in both conditions, infants imitated the model’s use of the unusual 
means more in the knowledgeable than in the ignorant condition. Thus, 1-year-old 
infants pay attention to the mental dimensions included in others’ intention forma-
tion, and they use this understanding when deciding what to imitate from them.
13.3.2  Understanding Others’ Intentions in Nonhuman 
Great Apes
Given our definition of intentions, for subjects to pass studies investigating the 
understanding of others’ actions in terms of intentions, it does not help to focus only 
on the question of what the other is trying to do. Additionally, the subjects have to 
pay attention to the means, that is, how the actor is trying to achieve the desired 
result. This seems to be difficult for great apes. When being presented with a model 
(human or conspecific) that performs a specific action in order to achieve a certain 
goal, they mostly seem to focus their attention on the end result of another’s action 
rather than the exact behavioral means that brings about the change in the world. For 
example, in the study by Tomasello et al. (1987), a chimpanzee was trained with a 
certain two-action methodology on a T-shaped tool that could be used to obtain out-­
of-­reach food. In contrast to a control group without any model, the chimpanzees 
that had the possibility to observe the trained ape obtaining food with the tool also 
used the tool to get food that was out of their reach. Interestingly, although those 
subjects learned to use the tool whereas the subjects of the control did not, the suc-
cessful subjects never copied the specific two-action method. They merely had 
D. Buttelmann

287
learned causal relations without paying attention to the exact strategies of the dem-
onstrator. Thus, apes mostly reproduce the end result of an action within social-­
learning situations (emulation learning, Tomasello, 1990, 1996) without copying 
the exact behavioral means that led to that result as human children do (e.g., Call 
et al., 2005; Call & Tomasello, 1994; Tennie et al., 2006). What remained unclear 
was whether this failure to imitate was due to an inability to focus their attention to 
the means used by the model. However, this might not be the case: Although the 
subjects did not imitate a successful means when it was their turn in a subsequent 
test phase, they successfully distinguished between a model trying to use a means 
that was successful in producing a reward in the past and a model who tried to open 
a reward box using a means not being demonstrated to be successful in the past 
(Buttelmann et al., 2013).
However, under some circumstances great apes do imitate. One such circum-
stance is a specific rearing environment. Indeed, human-raised or enculturated great 
apes often copy the specific actions of others (Bjorklund & Bering, 2003; Bjorklund 
et al., 2002; Tomasello & Carpenter, 2005; Tomasello et al., 1993). For instance, in 
the study of Bering et al. (2000), after a baseline period, a human demonstrator 
showed human-reared chimpanzees and orangutans a specific way of how to deal 
with several objects, e.g., use tongs bimanually to lift a cloth from a flat surface. 
After a delay of 10 min, the participants were then handed the objects again and 
scored for copying the demonstrator’s actions. All six participants displayed 
deferred imitation in at least one trial, with each species showing deferred imitation 
in approximately half of the trials they were tested in. Several reasons could account 
for the human-raised apes’ success to imitate. For example, it might be possible that 
those apes are exposed to tools and objects much more often than their mother-­
raised conspecifics, or they are notably trained to copy actions, or they actually 
possess a more detailed understanding of others’ intentions (see Call & Tomasello, 
1996). I will later come back to this issue.
There is also recent evidence that non-enculturated great apes can learn to use 
specific foraging techniques when observing a conspecific. This is important 
because it may give rise to the possibility to apply this method usually used with 
human infants to investigate an understanding of intentions even in mother-reared 
great apes. Whiten et al. (2005) trained two adult chimpanzees with different tool-­
use techniques on how to obtain food from an apparatus (i.e., a lifting versus a pok-
ing technique) unobserved by their group mates. When the two model chimpanzees 
were then re-introduced to their respective groups, most group members mastered 
the new technique after observing their local expert (no ape did in a control group 
without an expert). Most chimpanzees adopted the exact method that had been 
seeded in their group. In this and other studies, chimpanzees are not only shown to 
acquire specific techniques, but that the adopted methods are even transmitted from 
one group member to the other (e.g., Horner et al., 2006; Whiten et al., 2007). 
Further, it has been shown that the movement of the involved parts of the apparatus 
alone (ghost condition) does not lead to the accomplishment and the transmission of 
the technique (Hopper et al., 2007).
13  What Is Unique in Infant Thinking About Others? Infant Social Cognition…

288
Although it is impressive that great apes do imitate others, it remains unclear 
whether we can actually take this as evidence for an understanding of others’ inten-
tions as rational choices of action plans. Actually, this is questionable for virtually 
all studies that tested mother-raised or human-raised great apes with only classical 
imitation tasks. Only the fact that subjects copy the means a model is performing 
and achieve the goal the model achieved before does not necessarily prove that suc-
cessfully copying subjects understood the mental dimension behind this action (see 
Tomasello & Call, 1997). Still, two studies attempted to apply a rational-imitation 
paradigm like Gergely et al.’s (2002) head-touch task to great apes. Buttelmann 
et al. (2007) had enculturated chimpanzees watch a human model perform either a 
head touch, a foot touch, or a sit touch to illuminate a novel lamp or to play a sound 
from a novel sound box. The model either had to use these unusual means because 
of some physical constraints or he freely chose to use them without any constraint 
present. Like human infants, the chimpanzees imitated the model’s choice of means 
significantly more often when they freely chose to use them than when they were 
forced to use them. This was the first study to demonstrate that not only do great 
apes imitate others, they rather do so selectively. This finding might be less surpris-
ing given that the study subjects were enculturated. A subsequent study, however, 
found a similar pattern of results with great apes raised by their natural mothers. The 
study involving the rational choice of tools described above in the infant’s section 
(Buttelmann et al., 2008b) also tested great apes of all four species, i.e., chimpan-
zees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, on the very same tasks as the ones applied 
to human infants. The interesting finding was that species differences appeared: 
While mother-reared chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas did not differentiate 
between conditions, the mother-reared orangutans chose/used the tool the model 
chose more often in the not-blocked condition (mirroring the hands-free condition) 
than in the blocked condition (mirroring the hands-occupied condition). Thus, while 
chimpanzees seem to need some enculturation to put them in a position to imitate 
rationally, orangutans’ imitative responses suggest that they applied an understand-
ing of the model’s intentions as rational choices of action plans.
13.4  Human Infant and Nonhuman Great Ape Differences 
and Similarities in Their Understanding of Others’ 
Desires, Goals, and Intentions
Summing up the previous three sections, we can thus conclude that both human 
infants long before their second birthdays and great apes understand at least three 
different mental components in others’ intentional action. They can use others’ 
emotional expressions as indicators for their desires, they can interpret what others 
are trying to do (their goals), and they infer why an actor has chosen a specific 
means for how to achieve this goal (their intentions) and imitate this actor accord-
ingly. Infants and great apes can use this understanding when learning from others 
and when interpreting others’ behavior. Still, given that studies on great apes’ 
D. Buttelmann

289
understanding of intentions focus solely on rational imitation, more studies are 
needed to investigate whether great apes’ understanding of others’ intentions is 
similar to that of human infants. Assuming it is, understanding others’ desires, 
goals, and intentions does not seem to be the crucial element that differentiates 
infant social cognition from that of nonhuman great apes. What these three mental 
states have in common is that they have very strong behavioral correlates. In virtu-
ally all examples described above, subjects infer these mental states while watching 
a protagonist act. Thus, human infants and great apes might be able to extract men-
tal states from protagonists’ immediate actions (e.g., facial expressions, hand move-
ments, and so on) (e.g., Gergely & Csibra, 2003). Another thing that desires, goals, 
and intentions have in common is that they are non-propositional, that is, they can-
not be true or false. Although someone’s goal might be improper in some moral or 
societal sense, it is never false regarding an objective view. The next section will 
investigate whether differences between human infants’ and great apes’ social cog-
nition might lie in their understanding of propositional mental states, that is, beliefs.
13.5  Understanding Others’ Beliefs
In the last 15 years, the investigation on understanding others’ belief in preverbal 
children experienced a true revolution. This was because researchers found ways to 
present infants with language-reduced tasks. In contrast to the verbal tasks applied 
to toddlers and preschoolers for decades (e.g., Gopnik & Astington, 1988; Perner 
et al., 1987; Wimmer & Perner, 1983), these tasks on the one hand neither included 
long verbal instructions or stories nor did they require subjects to produce verbal 
responses. They thus measured subjects’ social-cognition competence implicitly.1 
Different types of tasks have been developed: tasks measuring (1) gaze behavior, (2) 
infants’ performance in interactions with others, and (3) neural activation.
13.5.1  Understanding of Others’ Beliefs in Human Infants
Although the first, pioneering study applying a gaze-behavior measure to investi-
gate belief understanding was run more than 25 years ago (Clements & Perner, 
1994), the rise of implicit false-belief tasks measuring gaze behavior started in ear-
nest with Onishi and Baillargeon’s (2005) application of a violation-of-expectation 
paradigm. The authors presented 15-month-old infants with live theatre scenarios in 
which an actor either watched (true-belief condition) or did not watch (false-belief 
condition) an object switch locations before she reached to either the previous 
1 I use the term “implicit” to refer to measures that do not require subjects to produce a verbal – and 
thus deliberate response – as well as those tasks that do not present subjects with verbal test 
questions.
13  What Is Unique in Infant Thinking About Others? Infant Social Cognition…

290
location or the new location of the object (i.e., the test event). When the actor 
reached, the researchers measured infants’ looking time at this event. Assuming that 
the actor reached because she wanted to have the object, then infants should expect 
her to reach for it where she knew or believed it to be (i.e., the new location in the 
true-­belief condition and the previous location in the false-belief condition). A vio-
lation of this expectation should become visible in an enhanced looking time at the 
incongruent event. This is what the authors found. The interpretation was that 
infants considered the actor’s representation of the object’s current location when 
interpreting the actor’s actions. A large body of subsequent violation-of-expectation 
false-­belief studies added empirical evidence to this interpretation (Kovács et al., 
2010; see Baillargeon et al., 2010; Scott & Baillargeon, 2017, for reviews).
Another gaze-based measure of infant false-belief understanding is the measure 
of anticipatory looking. For this, subjects receive a light or sound cue right before the 
actor re-enters the scene after a change of the target object’s location. Researchers 
measure at which of several areas of interest (i.e., possible locations the actor might 
reach) infants are looking while getting this cue. This anticipatory look is considered 
the infants’ anticipation of the actor’s reach. If infants included the actor’s belief 
about the object’s location into their prediction of the actor’s acting, they should look 
at the current location if the actor held a true belief and they should look at the previ-
ous location of the object if the actor falsely believed the object to be where it was 
before the switch. Eighteen-month-olds and slightly older children have been shown 
to expect an agent to approach the location where the agent believes the toy to be 
(Senju et al., 2011; Southgate et al., 2007; Thoermer et al., 2012).
Tasks measuring infants’ false-belief understanding in interactive settings also 
put infants in situations in which they observe an actor who either holds a true 
believe (i.e., she knows the true location of the target object) or a false believe (i.e., 
she believes the object to be in a previous location). At test, infants are placed in a 
situation in which they can interact with the either (e.g., they can help her or com-
municate with her). In the first study of this kind (Buttelmann et  al., 2009b), 
18-month-olds needed to infer the actor’s goal from the actor’s behavior that was 
based on the actor’s (true or false) belief about the location of an object. More spe-
cifically, after the actor had placed a toy in one of two boxes and left the room, an 
assistant relocated the toy into a second box. Thus, when the actor re-entered the 
scene and tried to open the now-empty box, he falsely believed the toy to be in the 
box he tried to open. The children then helped the actor by opening the other box 
(i.e., the one that actually contained the toy) because they inferred that the actor 
wanted to find his toy. Importantly, when the actor had witnessed the relocation and 
nevertheless tried to open the empty box, the infants helped him by opening the 
empty box rather than the one currently containing the toy. For 16-month-olds this 
effect was less clear: Although they differed in their choice of box between condi-
tions in the same pattern as did the older infants, in the true-belief condition they 
performed at chance level (instead of choosing the empty box significantly more 
often than the box with object).
Several subsequent interactive studies provided converging evidence for Buttelmann 
et al.’s (2009b) finding with 17- and 18-month-old infants (e.g., Buttelmann et al., 
2014, 2015; Knudsen & Liszkowski, 2012a, b; Southgate et al., 2010). These studies

also expanded the content of the actor’s beliefs about the content of a box or the iden-
tity of an object. In order to investigate whether the 18-month-olds in the Buttelmann 
et al. (2009b) study acted based on an understanding of beliefs (i.e., the actor believed 
the empty box to contain the toy) rather than an understanding of ignorance (i.e., the 
actor did not know where the toy was), Buttelmann et al. (2021b) presented 18-month-
olds with a replication of the false-­belief and a new ignorance condition, in which the 
actor did not know where the toy was in the first place. The infants’ helping behavior 
differed significantly between conditions: Whereas they opened the box with the 
object in the false-belief condition (replicating the original finding), they performed at 
chance level in the ignorance condition, where it was unclear whether the actor wanted 
his toy or wanted the empty box open. This might suggest that 18-month-olds indeed 
react to where an interaction partner represents an object.
The third class of infant false-belief tasks measures infants’ spontaneous neural 
responses to scenarios in which an actor acts while holding false or true beliefs 
(Hyde et al., 2015, 2018; Southgate & Vernetti, 2014). For example, in the Southgate 
and Vernetti (2014) study, using EEG, the authors measured 6-month-old infants’ 
sensorimotor alpha suppression as an indicator of motor-cortex activation. The 
infants showed such activation when an actor faced an empty box she believed to 
contain a toy, but they did not show activation of the motor cortex when the actor 
faced a box with an object she believed to be empty. This difference in motor activa-
tion suggests that if the actor believed the box to contain a toy, she might be reach-
ing for it, while she might not do so in case she believed the box to be empty.
Recently, the replicability of implicit infant false-belief tasks was questioned 
because of different levels of success in replication attempts. While some laborato-
ries successfully replicated and broadened previous results (e.g., Fizke et al., 2017; 
Oktay-Gür et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2015; Träuble et al., 2010), others failed to 
replicate earlier findings (e.g., Grosse Wiesmann et al., 2017; Yott & Poulin-Dubois, 
2016; Zmyj et al., 2015). This leads to different consequences: On the one hand, one 
needs to be careful when interpreting unsuccessful replication attempts because a 
large number of factors might influence children’s performance in such tasks (see 
Scott & Baillargeon, 2017; Schulze & Buttelmann, 2020). Already small changes in 
the set-up and the procedure might lead to results that differ from that of the original 
studies (see Baillargeon et al., 2018; Buttelmann, 2017). On the other hand, the lack 
of success in some of the replications suggests that infants’ understanding of others’ 
beliefs might be relatively fragile, being subject to task demands and the specific 
circumstances of the testing situation.
13.5.2  Understanding of Others’ Beliefs in Nonhuman 
Great Apes
The interesting question is how nonhuman great apes might perform in such implicit 
false-belief tasks. Given that these tasks do not require verbal instructions or 
responses, they are highly suitable candidates to be applied to species that lack lan-
guage. Indeed, after a number of unsuccessful attempts to find belief tracking in

chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans (Call & Tomasello, 1999; Kaminski et al., 
2008; Krachun et al., 2009, 2010), two studies – both using modified infant false-­
belief tasks – indicate that great apes do track others’ beliefs. In one of these studies 
(Krupenye et al., 2016), bonobos, chimpanzees, and orangutans as a group correctly 
anticipated a human actor’s goal-directed actions according to his belief about the 
location of an object (similar to how human infants did in the studies described 
above). More specifically, the apes observed videos in which an actor holding a 
false belief about the location of an object approached two target locations. As indi-
cated by the subjects’ first look, they anticipated that the actor was likely to act on 
the location where he falsely believed the object to be, in contrast to the location that 
actually held the object (as known by the subjects). Interestingly, great apes of the 
same three species also correctly anticipated a human actor’s searching actions in 
the absence of behavioral cues (Kano et al., 2019): After gaining self-experience 
with translucent and opaque “windows,” the apes observed a human actor who saw 
an object being placed in one of two locations. The actor then positioned himself 
behind either a translucent or an opaque window (both appeared identical without 
self-experience), and the object was switched from the first location to the other. 
Then the actor positioned himself between the two locations. The subjects correctly 
anticipated that the actor might search for the object where he believed it to be by 
looking at this location (i.e., the second location after observing the switch [translu-
cent window] or the first location after not observing [opaque window] the switch).
Like human infants, great apes also demonstrated their tracking of others’ beliefs 
in a more active task. Buttelmann et al. (2017) adopted the change-of-location inter-
active helping paradigm (Buttelmann et al., 2009b) and tested chimpanzees, bono-
bos, and orangutans. The authors found that the apes differed in their helping 
behavior according to whether the human actor held a true or a false belief about the 
location of an object. When observing the actor trying to open the empty box, they 
opened the box actually containing the object more when the actor believed this 
pulled box to contain the object than when the actor knew the pulled box was empty.
Thus, one might conclude that human infants and great apes are highly similar in 
their tracking of others’ beliefs, and they indeed might be. However, there might be 
one crucial difference, and this is the kind of actor the different species ascribe 
beliefs to. Human preschoolers and adults are known for their willingness to attri-
bute mental states including goals, intentions, and beliefs not only to human actors 
but also to self-propelled inanimate objects (Buttelmann & Buttelmann, 2017; 
Heider & Simmel, 1944; Montgomery & Montgomery, 1999), and even human 
infants ascribe goals and beliefs to self-propelled geometric shapes (Luo & 
Baillargeon, 2005; Surian & Geraci, 2012). In contrast, when Krupenye et al. (2017) 
replaced the human actor from their 2016 study with self-propelled geometric 
shapes, chimpanzees, bonobos, and orangutans did not adapt their anticipatory 
looks to the “beliefs” of the geometric shape. Thus, great apes seem to ascribe 
beliefs to animate actors only. Human infants’ preparedness to ascribe beliefs (and 
other mental states) to virtually all kinds of self-propelled objects might be a spe-
cific feature of human social cognition.

Except for this small difference, no big gap can be found in tracking others’ 
desires, goals, intentions, and beliefs between human infants and great apes. Thus, 
although understanding others’ mental states might provide the foundation for the 
emergence of human acquisitions like the creation and use of complicated tools and 
technologies, mathematic and graphic symbols, or the development of complex 
social institutions such as religions, states, or social norms, it cannot be the critical 
feature because much of it is shared with our closest genetic relatives who do not 
use mathematics or graphic symbols. But what is it then that sets human infants onto 
a way leading to the type of culture that outperforms virtually other species in com-
plexity and richness?
13.6  The Crucial Difference Between Humans 
and Great Apes
All the sophisticated acquisitions mentioned in the paragraph above do not rely on 
a single individual’s knowledge or ideas. They are most often products of collective 
cultural activities. Humans possess the motivation to take what was invented by 
their ancestors and accumulate and modify these inventions over generations (what 
Tomasello, 1999, calls the ratchet effect) to improve or create better artifacts. Thus, 
even though understanding others’ intentions is a fundamental aspect of social cog-
nition and social behavior, there seems to be another important capacity in situa-
tions that require the collaboration of several people.
In regards to this capacity, Tomasello et al. (2005) introduced a second line of 
human development; the human unique motivation to share psychological states 
with others. Human infants, at the age of only a few months, seem to have a strong 
interest in sharing emotions reflect by their interactions with adults in protoconver-
sations – social interactions in which the adult and the infant look, touch, smile, and 
vocalize toward each other in turn-taking sequences. Interestingly, what most 
observers have noted and researchers have found is that these protoconversations 
are held together through the exchange of emotions (Hobson, 2002; Stern, 1985; 
Trevarthen, 1979). Later, at the age of around 9 months, infants begin to engage 
with adults in triadic activities (Ratner & Bruner, 1978; Ross & Lollis, 1987). 
Infants start to share goals with adults as they act together to change the state of the 
world in some way and to perceive the world together in acts of joint perception 
(shared, or joint, attention). The infants’ motivation to share psychological states 
with others culminates shortly after their first birthday. At the age of 14 months, 
they not only understand others as intentional agents, they also have the desire to 
share their own intentions with others and begin to collaborate with others (Ross & 
Lollis, 1987; Warneken & Tomasello, 2007). At this stage of ontogeny, infants also 
start to use language, which in some theoretical perspectives is seen as an inherently 
collaborative activity by itself (see Clark, 1996).

294
As described before, an understanding of others’ mental states allows individuals 
to interpret others’ actions very explicitly. Being equipped with such a sophisticated 
understanding, an observer can make assumptions not only about the goal the 
observed individual is trying to achieve, but also about the particular manner with 
which this individual has chosen to act toward the goal. The observer can then 
develop some ideas about why the individual might have chosen to achieve the goal 
in that particular way based on the individual’s beliefs. Based on these assumptions, 
observers are provided with a powerful system of information about the other indi-
viduals’ action. This information can be used in two different contexts – competitive 
and cooperative. On the one hand, it can help in competitive situations, in which an 
individual tries to interpret a competitor’s behavior or tries to predict what a com-
petitor might do next – something apes are already quite good at (Hare et al., 2000, 
2001). In situations like these, the observing individual has an egocentric goal that 
it wants to fulfill (e.g., to steal food from the competitor) and plans to act to fulfill 
its goal for its own benefit. Acting this way might help the individual to survive and 
might even be adaptive for a whole species by allowing only the carrier of the best 
genes to reproduce (“survival of the fittest,” Spencer, 1864), but it averts the devel-
opment of the achievements that need more skills and power than one individual 
alone can provide.
On the other hand, this understanding is especially helpful in more cooperative 
activities, such as cultural learning and collaboration, when an individual needs to 
decide what it should copy from another individual or how best it can help or coor-
dinate with others (e.g., Bratman, 1992; Sebanz et al., 2006). In cooperative activi-
ties, two (or more) individuals have the same goal they want to fulfill (e.g., to build 
a house), and they act to fulfill their goal for their shared benefit. When using their 
sophisticated understanding of other’s mental states in such a way, a group of con-
specifics can meet challenges that one individual alone would not be able to cope 
with. So, although some apes apparently have the same understanding of others’ 
intentional actions as human infants do, they do not copy others or collaborate with 
others to anywhere near the same extent as humans (see Tomasello, 2019; Tomasello 
et al., 2005, for reviews). Although an understanding of others’ intentions is neces-
sary for human-like cultural learning and collaboration, it clearly is not sufficient.
Nonhuman great apes seem to lack the puzzle piece that turns more individualis-
tic skills of social learning and group action into their collectively based, uniquely 
human counterparts of cultural learning and collaboration. For suggesting what this 
missing piece might be, I need to reiterate Tomasello et al.’ (2005) idea that what is 
needed for “the uniquely human aspects of social cognition” to emerge is an interac-
tion of a sophisticated understanding of others’ intentional actions and a strong 
motivation to share intentions and other psychological states with others. Therefore, 
for an action to be performed in a collaborative manner it would not be enough to 
have the social-cognitive skills to know what action plan the other individual has 
rationally chosen in order to achieve its specific goal. What is necessary for human-­
like collaboration are specific social-motivational skills that, in combination with 
the social-cognitive skills, form shared intentionality, sometimes called “we” inten-
tionality (Tomasello, 2019). For shared intentionality, both (or more) individuals 
D. Buttelmann

295
must coordinate their action plans and commit themselves to the same goal and act 
according to their commitment (Gilbert, 1989; Searle, 1995; Tomasello & 
Carpenter, 2007).
The results reviewed above suggest that great apes seem to have the social-­
cognitive abilities necessary for shared intentionality: they understand others’ goals, 
intentions, and beliefs. What they might lack are the social-motivational prerequi-
sites necessary to transform these individual social-cognitive skills into shared 
intentionality that then allows cultural learning and collaboration in the narrow 
sense of the term to take place.
However, in humans, the roots of this unique motivation to share experiences 
with others can already be observed in very young infants. Infants from very early 
in ontogeny share emotional states with others in turn-taking sequences (Trevarthen, 
1979). Studies with slightly older children suggest that 24-month-olds prefer to 
perform an action that reveals an effect together with an adult, although they them-
selves could bring about the exact same effect when performing the action alone 
(Gräfenhain et al., 2009). Compared to this, great apes (with enculturated ones and 
maybe orangutans as an exception) also make use of their understanding of others’ 
mental states to interpret and predict others’ behavior (especially in competitive 
situations, see above) but do not copy an actor’s chosen action plan for the choice of 
which they cannot find a plausible reason. They do not consider these means as 
being important or necessary and therefore insist in using their own means to find 
solutions to solve a problem (i.e., emulation learning versus imitative learning). 
Thus, even if there were a plausible reason for the actor to choose her specific action 
plan that would also apply to the observer (e.g., maybe because this technique is 
more efficient for foraging), I would not expect mother-reared great apes (in the 
wild) to imitate this strategy (see Tomasello et al., 1987, for experimental evidence 
for this statement). Interestingly, in many instances in everyday human life, it seems 
on the surface to be even more adaptive not to copy the means of an actor but to 
emulate, and humans still do emulate in many occasions, as great apes predomi-
nantly do when learning socially (Tomasello & Call, 1997). The question this fact 
raises then is why did Mother Nature “allow” the human-innate social-motivational 
skills necessary for imitation (and therefore human-like culture) to evolve?
13.7  Future Directions
Because my major claim is that it is not predominant differences in social-cognitive 
skills but in pre-humans’ distinct social-motivational abilities that laid the founda-
tion for the development of human-like culture, future studies investigating this area 
should compare different species’ motivational levels to share psychological states 
with others. Now that there is evidence that under certain circumstances chimpan-
zees are motivated enough to help others or cooperate in a problem-solving task 
(Melis et al., 2006; Warneken et al., 2007; Warneken & Tomasello, 2006, 2007), 
studies are needed that investigate whether great apes possess some kinds of 
13  What Is Unique in Infant Thinking About Others? Infant Social Cognition…

296
motivations but lack the specific one to share psychological states with others. 
However, because the chimpanzees in Melis et al.’s (2006) study did not recruit 
cooperating partners when they were able to solve the task on their own, apes in 
general might perform differently than human children in tasks like the ones used 
by Gräfenhain et al. (2009).
There are two more questions of importance which deserve investigation. On the 
one hand, there is a need for more longitudinal studies that investigate the develop-
ment of the sophisticated social-cognitive skills during great apes’ ontogeny 
(Bjorklund, & Bering, 2003; Bjorklund et al., 2000; Wobber et al., 2014) to clarify 
to what degree it is similar to that of human infants. On the other hand, and this 
poses a huge challenge for comparative research, it would be interesting to see 
whether great apes also attribute the mental states they seem to understand in 
humans to their conspecifics. This could be possible by presenting them with 
(trained) great ape “demonstrators” and “models.” These are central questions for 
future research attempting to establish the evolutionary roots of human-specific 
social-cognitive abilities and motivations.
13.8  Conclusion
Although some groundbreaking studies enhanced our understanding of infant and 
nonhuman great-ape social cognition, many more studies are needed, and we need 
to draw conclusions carefully. However, the evidence so far helps to narrow down 
species differences in understanding others’ mental states – insofar as at least on the 
level of desires (in the meaning of preferences), goals, intentions, and beliefs, the 
gap between humans and nonhuman primates is smaller than was previously thought 
(e.g., Tomasello & Call, 1997). The perfect area to look for crucial differences 
between humans and nonhuman primates, in my opinion, is the field of social-­
motivational aspects that drive individuals’ behavior. Perhaps it is the lack of high 
motivation or interest to share psychological states with others (and less differences 
in social-cognitive abilities) that made the huge difference in human evolution and 
enabled our (Homo) ancestors to collaborate, to create cultures, and so to go beyond 
accomplishments that one individual alone could achieve.

Fear Learning in Infancy: An Evolutionary 
Developmental Perspective
David H. Rakison
“There is nothing to fear but fear itself” Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1933
14.1  Introduction
This statement, made by Franklin D.  Roosevelt during his inaugural address in 
1933, is poetic but not necessarily accurate. Fear is a core emotion that has an 
evolved function: it occurs in the face of a perceived threat or anticipation of such a 
threat and triggers physiological and behavioral responses that, on average, were 
adaptive for our ancestors. Snakes, heights, strangers, and public speaking can cer-
tainly hurt an individual—albeit in different ways—and the main functions of fear 
are to alert us to these threats and provide options on how to overcome or avoid 
them. Thus, classic fear behaviors include the flight or fight response as well as hid-
ing or freezing in the presence of potential threats. Fear is therefore a fundamental 
emotion that, simply put, helps to keep individuals safe and alive. In this way, there 
is plenty more to fear in the world than fear itself.
Typical fears—as rated by a Gallup poll in 2001—include snakes (ophidiopho-
bia), spiders (arachnophobia), heights (acrophobia), public speaking (glossopho-
bia), the dark (nyctophobia), enclosed spaces (claustrophobia), flying (aerophobia), 
and death (necrophobia). In some individuals, the fear that is experienced is 
extreme—or irrational—and such cases are labeled as phobias. In many cases, these 
fears and phobias develop early in life, lead to considerable distress, and can affect 
the day-to-day lives of those who experience them. Moreover, the incidence of fears 
and phobias is not trivial: for example, the most common phobias for nonhuman 
animals among children and adults are of snakes (5.5%) and spiders (3.5%) 
(Fredrikson et al., 1996), and the average incidence of fear in children across a mul-
titude of studies is approximately 5% (Costello & Angold, 1995).
This relatively high incidence of fears and phobias in humans—and their subse-
quent effect on the lives who experience them—has led researchers to ask how these

fears develop, whether the mechanisms for learning are the same for all fears, 
whether fears are the same in humans and nonhuman animals, and whether they are 
the same in human infants, children, and adults. The traditional view of fear and 
phobic anxiety generally relied on the concept of fear conditioning (e.g., the pairing 
of a neutral stimulus with a negative event), while others have proposed a nonasso-
ciative model that asserts that certain fears are not learned at all and are instead 
innate (Poulton & Menzies, 2002). However, more recent conceptualizations of 
fears and phobias have taken into consideration evolutionary psychology. As a 
result, there is now a considerable database on the existence of a specialized fear 
mechanism in human infants (e.g., LoBue & DeLoache, 2008, 2010; Rakison, 
2005a, 2018; Rakison & Derringer, 2008), human adults (e.g., Mineka et al., 1984; 
Tomarken et al., 1989), and nonhuman animals (e.g., Kats et al., 1988; Kiesecker 
et al., 1996). In this chapter, I describe the different theories of emotions and fear 
acquisition and offer an evolutionary developmental approach to the study of fear 
acquisition, especially for recurrent threats such as snakes and spiders.
14.2  Theories of Fear Acquisition
There are three main models to explain fear learning, and each has empirical sup-
port to some extent. As the following section will demonstrate, some of these theo-
ries are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Thus, it may be possible to acquire fears 
for some stimuli via one mechanism and another via a different mechanism. This is 
largely because it has been posited that fears for evolutionarily recurrent threats—
snakes, spiders, open spaces, public speaking, for example—may be acquired via 
specialized pathways, whereas fears for other, more modern things—clowns, guns, 
cars, cigarettes, for instance—may be learned via more general pathways. In the 
next section, I outline the three main theoretical approaches to fear learning: tradi-
tional models, nonassociative models, and prepared-learning models.
14.2.1  Traditional Models
In a seminal psychology experiment, John Watson (Watson & Rayner, 1920) dem-
onstrated that 9-month-old “Little Albert” could be classically conditioned to fear a 
white rat when it was repeatedly presented with loud noise, a fear that then general-
ized to other furry objects including a rabbit and a fur coat. This finding, and subse-
quent work on the effect of classical conditioning on fear learning, underpins the 
oldest models of fear learning. According to these traditional models, fears are 
learned through domain-general mechanisms—often via classical conditioning—
and as such these models were powerfully influenced by the work of the behaviorist 
movement. I use the term domain-general mechanism here to refer to those mecha-
nisms that are not dedicated to a single function or learning context—as is often the

case with adaptive specialized psychological mechanisms—but rather can underpin 
learning across a wide range of inputs (e.g., visual, auditory, tactile) and across a 
wide range of domains (e.g., math, word-learning, categorization, space).
These traditional models were later extended by Rachman (1977), who posited 
that there are three domain-general pathways by which individuals can learn fear. 
One of these pathways involves direct learning through classical conditioning, as 
was the case for Little Albert. The other two pathways involve indirect learning 
either through observation—when an individual observes fear in another person in 
the presence of a fear-inducing stimulus—or through verbally transmitted informa-
tion when an individual is explicitly told to fear a stimulus (e.g., telling children to 
stay away from dark, enclosed spaces). Rachman’s (1977) model has been highly 
influential and remains so. Few researchers question the existence of these path-
ways, and there is considerable evidence to support each one. For example, experi-
ence of a traumatic event—surviving the sinking of a ship or observing a lightning 
strike, for instance—leads to heightened fear for stimuli related to the incident 
(Dollinger et al., 1984; Yule et al., 1990). Not surprisingly, there are few experimen-
tal studies with humans on the effect of conditioning on fear learning because it is 
not ethical to teach fears to children or adults for research purposes.
There is also evidence that humans and nonhuman animals can acquire fears through 
the two indirect pathways, vicarious conditioning and observational learning. In one clas-
sic study, for example, monkeys that had lived only in captivity were shown video foot-
age of other monkeys as they demonstrated a fear response to either a snake or a flower 
(Cook & Mineka, 1990). Following exposure to this footage, the subjects reacted fear-
fully to snakes but not to flowers. Related and similar findings have been reported for a 
variety of other nonhuman primates such as squirrel monkeys, chimpanzees, and other 
apes (e.g., Joslin et  al., 1964; Rumbaugh, 1968; Schiller, 1952; Yerkes, 1943). 
Experimental work that demonstrates observational fear learning in humans is scarce, but 
there are a number of ingenious studies on this topic (Askew & Field, 2007, 2008). For 
instance, toddlers learn to avoid toy snakes, spiders, flowers, and mushrooms after 
observing their mothers’ negative facial expressions (Dubi et al., 2008; Gerull & Rapee, 
2002), and 7- to 9-year-olds more slowly approach animals—and show greater levels of 
fear compared to baseline—that they previously saw paired with a fearful face than those 
that were paired with a happy face (Askew & Field, 2007). Finally, 12- to 20-month-old 
children who watched their mothers model positive behaviors toward a toy snake or toy 
spider showed more approach behaviors toward those toys relative to a control group 
(Egliston & Rapee, 2007). This final study illustrates that children can acquire positive 
responses to fear-relevant stimuli through observation.
14.2.2  Nonassociative Models
According to this perspective, Rachman’s 3-pathway model fails to take into account 
the fact that humans have experienced the same, recurrent threats over 100,000 s of 
years of evolution and that one-trial learning for our ancestors during this

time—being bitten to find out that an animal can kill you—would not have been 
adaptive. The solution, according to this model, is to add one additional pathway to 
the Rachman model such that fears for specific recurrent threats (e.g., snakes, 
heights) develop early in life and are innate and present without experience (Menzies 
& Clarke, 1995; Poulton & Menzies, 2002). A corollary of this approach is that fear 
learning relies on conditioning for evolutionary neutral stimuli and a specialized 
mechanism for evolutionary-negative stimuli. From this perspective, children 
unlearn fears—rather than learn them—through multiple positive exposures to the 
fear-inducing evolutionary-negative stimulus.
There is considerable evidence in the literature to support the nonassociative 
approach, but much of it stems from research with nonhuman animals. It has been 
shown, for instance, that lab-reared young salamanders react to chemical cues of 
predatory fish by moving to shelter (Kats et al., 1988), and that toad tadpoles reared 
in captivity exhibit an antipredator response to three species that naturally predate 
on them but not to two other predators from their environment that do not find them 
palatable (Kiesecker et al., 1996). This suggests that toad tadpoles possess instinc-
tual triggers to defensive responses that are activated by cues from their coevolved 
predators.
At the same time, there is a relative dearth of research on whether humans’ fears 
are derived innately. What evidence exists is mostly from retrospective analyses in 
which parents report the root of their child’s fears. Thus, a number of studies found 
that parents often report that their child was fearful of water, spiders, and heights 
during their first experience of them (Menzies & Clarke, 1993; for a review, see 
Poulton & Menzies, 2002). There also exist developmental data that suggest that 
fears are not present early in life. Thrasher and LoBue (2016), for example, demon-
strated that 6- and 9-month-olds show no physiological signs of fear (e.g., acceler-
ated heart rate or a large startle magnitude) when presented with snakes. Moreover, 
in two series of studies, LoBue, Deloache, and colleagues (DeLoache & LoBue, 
2009; LoBue et al., 2013) found that 9-month-olds exhibit no differences in behav-
ior toward snakes and nonsnake animals, and that 18- to 36-month-olds show no 
evidence of avoiding live snakes and spiders and show an equal level of interest in 
threatening and nonthreatening (e.g., a hamster) animals. Thus, the nonassociative 
model has garnered only minimal support from research with adults and young 
children, and the methods used to generate evidence for it have not considered how 
indirect pathways to fear learning may play an important role in this process (Muris 
et al., 2002).
14.2.3  Prepared-Learning Model
Although the general learning model can account for how many fears are acquired—
Rachman’s pathways account for how 94% of children and adult attribute fears 
(King et al., 1998)—it fails to explain why the most common fears and phobias tend 
to be for evolutionarily relevant stimuli such as fear of snakes and spiders, heights,

enclosed and open spaces, and blood or injury (Coelho & Purkis, 2009; Marks & 
Nesse, 1994; Öhman & Mineka, 2001; Seligman, 1971). This observation was in 
part why the nonassociative model was developed. According to associative models, 
fears for all stimuli are acquired through domain-general learning—classical condi-
tioning or observational learning (Mineka & Zinbarg, 2006; Rachman, 1977)—and 
therefore in principle it should be equally easy to acquire fears for more or less all 
stimuli. Indeed, this is part of the reason why the nonassociative model was devel-
oped; that is, it is evident that human’s most common fears and phobias tend to be 
evolutionarily recurrent threats, and one potential explanation for this phenomenon 
was the idea that fears for these threats need not be learned (Poulton & Menzies, 2002).
According to the prepared-learning model, no fears are present without experience. 
Rather, because humans coevolved with a number of recurrent threats over millions of 
years of evolution, selection pressures would have led to the emergence of a special-
ized fear-learning mechanism for these recurrent threats. Thus, although most 
researchers concur that fear can be acquired via Rachman’s three pathways, it has 
been suggested that there is also a class of entities, contexts, and events that humans 
have evolved to fear more quickly than other things—those that are privileged were 
recurrent threats throughout human and prehuman evolutionary history (Öhman & 
Mineka, 2001; Seligman, 1971). Consistent with this view is the idea that fears are on 
a continuum of learning such that individuals can learn fears for evolutionarily recur-
rent threats with only a brief exposure, whereas they learn other fears—for nonrecur-
rent threats particularly—through multiple negative experiences (Marks, 2002).
There is now considerable evidence with nonhuman animals to suggest that fear 
learning for evolutionarily recurrent threats is indeed privileged and may occur 
more rapidly than for nonrecurrent threats (Seligman, 1971). For example, classic 
work on what is now labeled the Garcia effect demonstrated that rats that consumed 
sweetened water followed by no radiation, mild radiation, or strong radiation subse-
quently tended to avoid the sweetened water when it was followed by strong radia-
tion (Garcia et  al., 1955), and that rats swiftly associate gastric sickness with 
consumption of food or liquid but do not associate sickness with stimuli such as 
noises or lights (Garcia & Koelling, 1966). Both of these examples illustrate that not 
all associations are born equal and as such support the idea that certain inputs are 
privileged in learning.
I described briefly earlier one study that tested the notion that fears for specific 
recurrent threats are privileged in learning for nonhuman mammals; that is, captive 
monkeys can rapidly be taught to fear snakes but not flowers through social refer-
encing (Cook & Mineka, 1990; for a review, see Öhman & Mineka, 2001; Mineka 
et al., 1984). There is also evidence that snake fears are privileged in human adults. 
The earliest studies on this issue used classical conditioning of skin conductance 
responses (SCRs), in which adults were presented with snakes, spiders, mushrooms, 
or flowers paired with an electric shock (Öhman et al., 1976). Following exposure, 
adults anticipated the electric shock for all four stimuli, but this response was harder 
to extinguish for adults conditioned with snakes and spiders than for those condi-
tioned with mushrooms and flowers. Similar findings have been discovered for 
threatening facial expressions (Öhman & Dimberg, 1978) and when the recurrent 
threat was presented subliminally (Esteves et al., 1994; Esteves & Öhman, 1993).

14.3  Fear Learning: An Evolutionary 
Developmental Approach
The theories of fear learning encompass how all fears are acquired by humans and 
nonhuman animals, especially if the preparedness approach is added to Rachman’s 
3-pathway model (see Rachman, 2002). At the same time, key aspects of fear learn-
ing—particularly within the preparedness model—cannot be addressed without 
adopting a developmental approach. For example, what mechanisms or processes 
allow for privileged processing of specific recurrent threats? This is not a trivial 
question, and a number of critics of evolutionary psychology are skeptical at the 
notion that biases for processing can be specified in the genes. In addition, at what 
point in developmental time do infants or children acquire fears? Until relatively 
recently, most of the research on fear acquisition used nonhuman animals and adult 
humans as participants, but this research has shed little light on the origins of fears 
for recurrent threats. Moreover, a prediction of the prepared-learning model is that 
infants and young children should initially exhibit no fear of recurrent threats—
because unlike the nonassociative model, it does not assume that fears are present 
without experience—but should then demonstrate rapid learning of those threats in 
the laboratory or the real world. In the next section, I outline my theory of how 
infants acquire fears for recurrent threats and then present evidence to support this 
view as well as the prepared model more generally.
Elsewhere, I have proposed that infants possess a specialized mechanism that has 
two processes or components (LoBue et al., 2010; LoBue & Rakison, 2013; Rakison, 
2005a, 2018; Rakison & Derringer, 2008). The first component involves a percep-
tual bias that leads infants to attend to recurrent threats when they are observable in 
the environment; a snake is more likely to grab and hold an infant’s attention than a 
flower. I have suggested that this perceptual bias stems from innate perceptual tem-
plates of recurrent threats—such as snakes and spiders—that cause infants to detect 
and attend to those stimuli when they are present. The idea of a perceptual template 
was initially proposed to explain why newborn infants track face-like stimuli longer 
than scrambled versions of those stimuli (Johnson & Morton, 1991; Johnson et al., 
1991; see Bjorklund & Hart, Chap. 1, this volume); that is, it was posited that infants 
are born with a bias for “top-heavy” stimuli that have two blobs at the top and one 
blob below, akin to the eyes and mouth of a human face. In a similar vein, I pro-
posed that infants have such a bias for objects and contexts that were recurrent 
threats, with snakes and spiders the most likely candidates (Rakison, 2018; Rakison 
& Derringer, 2008). These perceptual templates comprise a basic schema of the 
shape of recurrent threats and are likely similar in format to the bias for top-heavy 
stimuli; that is, they broadly specify their shape. Thus, a spider template likely rep-
resents a central body with legs protruding outward from it, and a snake template 
likely represents an elongated or coiled rope-like shape.
Because these templates represent the general shape of these objects, it is possi-
ble that infants (and older children and adults) may attend to objects of that shape in 
the environment that are not recurrent threats. For instance, LoBue (2014; LoBue & 
D. H. Rakison

309
DeLoache, 2011) found that adult participants detect curvilinear shapes more 
quickly than similar rectilinear shapes and that this ability is only moderately 
affected by labeling the curvilinear shapes as snakes. That an evolved specialized 
fear mechanism may lead to “errors” in identifying threats is consistent with Nesse’s 
(1990) “Smoke detection principle”: it is more beneficial for smoke detectors to 
activate more often than they should because the cost for not activating is higher—
that is, potential death—than for activating. Likewise, specialized adaptations are 
designed by natural selection to trigger in the direction that increases survival and 
reduces reproductive costs, and humans are therefore more likely to identify some-
thing as threat (e.g., a coiled rope) because the fitness cost of not identifying such a 
threat would be high.
The second process in the fear mechanism is an associative-learning mechanism 
that causes infants rapidly—perhaps in one trial—to representationally pair the 
threat stimulus with an emotional and behavioral response from a conspecific (i.e., 
social learning) or the effect it had on the self (e.g., a spider bite) (see also Clark 
Barrett & Broesch, 2012). As discussed earlier, this general notion is at the core of 
prepared-learning theory; some fears, those for recurrent threats, are learned more 
easily and quickly than others. Note also that the idea of rapid learning for specific 
stimuli is not limited to fear learning. Infants around 18–24  months of age go 
through the naming explosion during which they accelerate considerably in their 
ability to learn labels. Among other things, what is believed to support this sudden 
acceleration is the emergence of a process called fast-mapping whereby infants 
learn labels following only one exposure to the label and referent such that they are 
associatively represented (Carey & Bartlett, 1978). However, that dogs (Kaminski 
et al., 2004) can also engage in what appears to be fast-mapping for labels suggests 
that such privileged learning is not limited either to humans or to only one domain.
Although this perspective captures much of the preparedness model, it goes 
beyond that model because it applies the idea that privileged learning is under-
pinned by perceptual biases—that are present without experience—that cause 
humans to acquire fears for some threats more rapidly than others. Others have 
offered similar proposals that incorporate the view that humans have early percep-
tual biases for threatening stimuli (Field & Lester, 2010; Kindt & van den Hout, 
2001). Implicit in these other perspectives is the notion that both the biases for 
threats and the mechanism for learning about these threats are specialized. However, 
although I endorse the idea that there is a domain-specific perceptual bias for threats, 
it remains an open question whether the process that underpins the rapid one-trial 
learning often observed during fear learning is domain-specific, especially given 
that the same basic effect is found for language learning.
Over the last 15 years, developmentalists have started to address these issues 
empirically, and in the sections that follow I outline the evidence that has been gar-
nered from this research. I begin by discussing evidence for the first component of 
the proposed fear mechanism—a bias to attend to recurrent threats—and then assess 
evidence for the second component (rapid learning for fear-relevant stimuli).

14.3.1  Attention Biases for Recurrent Threats
There is evidence to suggest that human adults may possess perceptual templates—
representational schematics that are present at birth—for evolutionarily recurrent 
dangerous taxa, including snakes and spiders, which have reliably distinctive fea-
tures (see Öhman & Mineka, 2001). New and German (2015; see also Öhman et al., 
2001), for example, found that adults in an inattentional-blindness paradigm detect, 
localize, and identify iconic spiders and are less likely to perceive stimuli with dif-
ferent configurations of the same features, modern threatening stimuli such as hypo-
dermic needle, or fear-irrelevant nonhuman animals like houseflies. Because such 
experiments relied on human adults, it is possible that a lifetime of experience with 
snakes or spiders led to the observed effects. Thus, it is necessary to demonstrate 
that younger individuals—children and (ideally) infants—exhibit the same basic 
effects as adults to confirm the idea that humans are born with a bias to attend to 
recurrent threats.
I have conducted a number of behavioral studies to examine whether infants pos-
sess a bias to attend to recurrent threats. The studies rely on a similar paradigm to 
that used in classic work by Johnson and colleagues (Johnson et  al., 1991) on 
infants’ perceptual template for faces. In one experiment, Rakison and Derringer 
(2008) presented 5-month-old infants with three schematic images of spiders that 
moved horizontally back and forth across a computer screen (Fig. 14.1). One image 
was a schematic spider, a second was the same schematic spider except that it had 
reconfigured features, and a third was a linear image of the spider that was com-
pletely scrambled. Infants’ total looking time to each stimulus was recorded. In line 
with previous work on face tracking in newborns (Johnson & Morton, 1991), it was 
predicted that if 5-month-olds possess a perceptual template for spiders they would 
look longer at the schematic spider stimulus than the other two reconfigured stimuli; 
this was the pattern of looking generated by infants in the experiment. Subsequent 
experiments with the same design revealed that infants do not show the same effect 
for nonthreatening stimuli such as flowers. A final experiment tested whether

5-month-olds’ perceptual template generalizes to spiders in the real world. Infants 
were habituated to various color photographs of real spiders and then shown the 
three schematic images of spiders from the first experiment. Results revealed that 
5-month-old infants showed a reversal of the pattern of looking from the first exper-
iment; that is, they looked longer at the two reconfigured images than the schematic 
spider, which suggests that they generalized from the real images of spiders and 
found the schematic image familiar.
Isbell (2006) has argued that venomous snakes—a critical predator on many 
nonhuman animals throughout their evolution—were a driving force in developing 
the vision of advanced primates. In other words, because primates were recurrently 
the prey of snakes, there would have been strong selection pressures to detect snakes 
quickly. Thus, fear of snakes may have its origins in mammalian evolution when 
such threats were a prevalent and recurrent threat. In line with this idea, evidence 
suggests the existence in human adults of neurons in the primate medial and dorso-
lateral pulvinar that respond selectively to visual images of snakes (He et al., 2014; 
Van Le et al., 2013).
To address whether infants possess a perceptual template of snakes, I conducted 
similar experiments to those in Rakison and Derringer (2008) with snakes instead of 
spiders (Rakison, 2018). Thus, 5-month-olds were shown a schematic snake, a 
snake with slightly reconfigured features, and a snake that was completely scram-
bled (see Fig. 14.2), and their looking time was measured for each one. Infants’ 
looking behavior for these stimuli was the same as it was for spiders: they looked 
longer at the schematic snake than at the other two stimuli (and equally long at those 
other stimuli). As in Rakison and Derringer (2008), a follow-up study determined 
that infants treated the schematic snake as familiar after being habituated with pic-
tures of real snakes.
This work suggests that infants attend to an image of a snake relative to scram-
bled versions of the same image, but it is also important to establish that infants 
attend to snakes when they are presented in competition with another stimulus; that 
is, a perceptual template for snakes should drive infants’ attention toward snakes 
and away from other, nonthreatening stimuli. To investigate this issue, LoBue and 
DeLoache (2010) showed 8- to 14-month-olds a snake and a flower side by side and 
measured how quickly infants oriented their head to look at them. Results revealed, 
as predicted by the preparedness model, that infants oriented to snakes more rapidly

312
than to flowers. Notably, infants also oriented more quickly to angry faces than to 
happy faces—an effect that holds through early childhood (LoBue, 2009), which 
implies that threatening stimuli more broadly may be privileged in visual attention 
(LoBue & DeLoache 2009).
More recently, LoBue et al. (2017) used eye-tracking to examine whether there 
were any developmental differences among 4- to 24-month-olds in their bias to 
attend to snakes. To address this question, infants were shown two images on a 
computer screen, one of which was threatening (e.g., snake) and one of which was 
not (e.g., a frog) for 1000 ms, after which the images disappeared and a probe then 
appeared for 500 ms in one of the two locations of the images. Results revealed not 
only that prior to the probe infants of all ages were more likely to look first at the 
snake rather than at the frog but also that infants were faster to fixate to the probe if 
it replaced the image of the snake than that of the frog. In a similar vein, Bertels 
et al. (2018) demonstrated that 7- to 11-month-olds orient more quickly to snakes 
than to flowers and also that detection of a snake in the visual periphery accelerates 
the automatic engagement of attention toward its location.
Recent electrophysiological work also suggests that the infant brain responds 
differently to snakes and nonsnakes (Bertels et al., 2020). The scalp electrical brain 
activity of 7- to 10-month-olds was measured while the infants watched sequences 
of flickering animal pictures (snakes vs. frogs and snakes vs. caterpillars). Results 
revealed that regardless of the foil (frogs or caterpillars), infants generated neural 
responses that were higher in amplitude and more widespread for snakes. Moreover, 
stronger neural activity for snakes occurred in the occipital area, which suggests that 
the bias to orient to snakes may be driven by their visual physical attributes. Based 
on these findings, the authors concluded that snake detection is underpinned by a 
neurobiological substrate that is functional in the first year of life, is sensitive to the 
physical appearance of snake, and occurs independently of prior experience 
with snakes.
These studies suggest that young infants may have a perceptual template for 
spiders and snakes. It remains an open question whether infants possess such tem-
plates for other threats. Two interesting candidates are rodents—particularly rats—
and sharks because these animals typically evoke a fear reaction in humans, although 
they are rarely among the top 10 fears and phobias. At the same time, neither rats 
nor sharks predate on humans. Rats are feared not because they can physically harm 
humans—especially human infants—but rather because they are known to spread 
disease; however, because this associative link is rarely contiguous it is unlikely that 
selection pressures would have led to the emergence of a perceptual template for 
rats. Sharks, although often the center of fear-inducing media—the movies Jaws 
and Megalodon, for example—are responsible for relatively few human deaths each 
year (generally, more people die each year from falling coconuts than sharks). Thus, 
it is also unlikely that humans would have an evolved perceptual template for sharks. 
To test these predictions, 5-month-old infants were presented with schematic 
rodents or sharks, as well as two scrambled versions of each of those stimuli 
(Rakison, 2018). Consistent with the reasoning presented above, infants looked 
equally long at all three stimuli for both rodents and sharks. Taken together, this

313
body of research suggests that infants may have perceptual templates for recurrent 
threats—snakes and spiders—but do not possess such templates for potentially dan-
gerous animals that coevolved with humans but that rarely acted as threats to humans.
To my knowledge, the studies described above are the only ones to test whether 
young infants show a bias to attend to recurrent threats. An important question is 
whether this bias remains in place beyond infancy, because if humans possess a 
perceptual template for recurrent threats then this should continue to operate 
throughout the life span. To examine this question, LoBue and DeLoache (2008) 
used a visual search paradigm—in which participants have to find the odd-one-out 
in a 3 by 3 matrix of pictures—with 3-, 4-, and 5-year-old children as well as adults 
and with images of snakes, flowers, frogs, and caterpillars. Adults and children 
detected a snake among flowers more rapidly than a flower among snakes, a snake 
among frogs more rapidly than a frog among snakes, and even a snake among cat-
erpillars more rapidly than a caterpillar among snakes. Follow-up studies with the 
same paradigm revealed that preschoolers (and adults) locate spiders more quickly 
among mushrooms and cockroaches than vice versa, and there is no difference in 
the time to find cockroaches among mushrooms and vice versa (LoBue, 2010b). 
Moreover, this rapid detection is accentuated if snakes are presented in a threatening 
pose (Masataka et al., 2010), operates for both black and white pictures of snakes 
(Hayakawa et al., 2011; LoBue & DeLoache, 2011; Masataka et al., 2010), and has 
been demonstrated in Japanese monkeys (Shibasaki & Kawai, 2009).
In sum, there is strong evidence that human infants—as well as a number of 
nonhuman primates—have a bias to attend to, and detect, recurrent threats such as 
snakes and spiders (LoBue, 2010a; LoBue & DeLoache, 2010; Rakison, 2018; 
Rakison & Derringer, 2008). This effect has been demonstrated in a variety of para-
digms, continues through early childhood and into adulthood, and it holds, regard-
less of whether the recurrent threat is presented alone or in competition with a 
distractor stimulus. At the same time, infants do not exhibit the same bias to attend 
to nonthreatening inanimate stimuli such as mushrooms and flowers, or a bias to 
attend to nonthreatening animates such as rodents, sharks, cockroaches, or frogs. 
These data, especially those with infants, suggest that humans may have an evolved 
bias to orient to specific recurrent threats when they are in the surrounding environ-
ment. I have suggested here and elsewhere (Rakison, 2005a, 2018; LoBue & 
Rakison, 2013; LoBue et al., 2010) that this bias results from an innate perceptual 
template of those recurrent threats.
How might such templates drive attention toward threat? To address this ques-
tion, LoBue and her colleagues (2014) used the visual search paradigm with adults 
but employed an eye-tracker to examine the factors that underpin faster fixations to 
threatening stimuli. They found that the effect is only present in larger matrices (3 
by 3) but not in smaller matrices (2 by 2), which suggests that bottom-up factors in 
part drive threat detection. More importantly, they demonstrated not only that (as 
expected) adults fixated threatening stimuli more quickly but also that the behav-
ioral response was faster for those threatening stimuli than nonthreatening stimuli. 
Thus, one way a perceptual template may cause infants (and potentially adults) to 
attend to threats is by not only helping them to detect the stimulus, to stay attended 
14  Fear Learning in Infancy: An Evolutionary Developmental Perspective

314
to it, and then to respond to it (perhaps, through a learning pathway). In this way, a 
perceptual template may engage the infant in both attention-getting and attention-­
holding (Cohen, 1972) for recurrent threats.
14.3.2  Limitations
A number of critiques have been levied at the notion that humans have a bias to 
detect evolutionarily relevant stimuli that were recurrent threats. For example, 
snakes and spiders are commonly in the top 10 fears and phobias cited by adults, 
and they are frequently (if not exclusively) used as the recurrent threat stimulus in 
psychological research on fear learning. However, although snakes likely were and 
currently are a threat to humans, there is little evidence that spiders are a threat to 
humans in modern times. Indeed, adult subjects report that spiders belong to a cat-
egory of animals—along with rats and cockroaches—that are not considered dan-
gerous to humans but are nonetheless fear-evoking (Matchett & Davey, 1991): thus, 
humans may fear these nonhuman animals—as well as those in a category that 
provokes revulsion (e.g., maggots, slugs)—due to disgust sensitivity rather than 
threat-relevance.
A second criticism of threat detection research relates to the fact that adults 
develop fears through a lifetime of experience. Thus, adults may find snakes and 
spiders more quickly than nonthreats in a visual search task because of their previ-
ous experience with those animals. However, although this critique cannot be 
addressed in research with adults, that infants and young children demonstrate the 
same effects as adults suggests that this bias to attend to snakes and spiders is pres-
ent early in development and likely exists prior to experience with those threats.
14.4  Rapid Associative Learning for Recurrent Threats
Recall that the proposed specialized fear-learning mechanism I have outlined here 
has two components. Evidence for the first component—a bias to attend to recurrent 
threats—was outlined in the previous section. In the current section, I outline the 
evidence for the second component of this system whereby the recurrent threat is 
rapidly—potentially in one trial—associated with the appropriate response.
It is well established that infants are able to engage more broadly in paired cor-
relation learning of two features or properties (e.g., Madole & Cohen, 1995; 
Rakison, 2004, 2005b, Slater et al., 1991; Younger & Cohen, 1986). This ability is 
present at birth, such that newborns who were familiarized to stimulus compounds—
a green vertical stripe and a red diagonal stripe, for example—encoded the correla-
tion between the two features (color and angle of the stripe) rather than each of the 
features independently (Slater et al., 1991). By 7–10 months of age, this ability 
develops—likely as a result of improving information-processing abilities—such 
D. H. Rakison

315
that infants can encode correlations for features of schematic animals (Younger & 
Cohen, 1986). There is also evidence that for infants, at least, some correlations are 
privileged in a learning context. In a number of studies, I have demonstrated that 
infants in a variety of learning contexts will encode some of the available correla-
tions and ignore others (Rakison, 2004, 2005b, Rakison & Poulin-Dubois, 2002; see 
also Madole & Cohen, 1995); at 14 months of age, infants encode relations between 
dynamic cues (i.e., a moving part and an object’s motion trajectory) but not relations 
involving static cues (i.e., those involving the body of the object) (Rakison & 
Poulin-Dubois, 2002); at 16 months of age, infants encode relations when an agent 
of a causal action has a moving feature but not when a recipient does (Rakison, 
2005b). This phenomenon has been attributed in part to attentional biases, such that 
infants are born with a preference to attend to, for example, large, moving features 
and objects (Rakison & Lupyan, 2008). The question of interest in this section is 
whether human infants demonstrate a similar capacity for learning about recurrent 
threats; that is, whether infants are more likely to learn some correlations—those 
involving recurrent threats—than others (those that do not). To date, only a small 
handful of studies have investigated this issue.
In one of the first studies to examine this question, DeLoache and LoBue (2009; 
Experiment 2) used the audiovisual matching paradigm to test whether infants 
would look at a snake rather than a nonthreat when they heard a fearful voice. This 
paradigm relies on the finding that infants tend to look at images or videos that 
match; for example, 5- to 7-month-olds look at a happy face longer than at an angry 
face when they hear a happy voice (Walker-Andrews, 1986; see also Golinkoff 
et al., 1987). To investigate whether infants would show the same pattern for threat-
ening stimuli, DeLoache and LoBue (2009) showed 7- to 16-month-olds pairs of 
videos (Experiment 2) or still color photographs (Experiment 3) in parallel with one 
stimulus (a snake) and the other an exotic nonsnake (e.g., elephant, giraffe). As the 
stimuli were presented, a central speaker played either a fearful voice or a happy 
voice speaking a nonsense phrase. As predicted by the prepared-learning model, 
infants at both 8 and 16 months of age looked at the snakes longer when they heard 
a fearful voice than when they heard a happy voice, but this effect held only for the 
videos and not the still images. Moreover, in both studies, infants oriented to the 
snakes more quickly than to the other animals. Thus, even though the participants in 
the study likely had minimal or no experience of snakes, in the presence of a fearful 
sounding voice the infants oriented to the snake, suggesting that snakes may consti-
tute privileged stimuli for fear learning.
The previous study demonstrated a bias to attend to snakes in the presence of a 
fearful voice, but it included no measure of learning. Thus, an important question is 
whether infants preferentially associate snakes and spiders with a fearful response 
when given an opportunity to learn. To examine this issue, I habituated 11-month-­
old infants to an event in which a snake or spider appeared on a screen paired with 
either a happy or a fearful face (Rakison, 2009, Experiment 1). During the test 
phase, infants were presented with a novel snake or spider—depending on which 
they were habituated to—paired with a different face from that seen during habitu-
ation (e.g., happy if fearful). They also saw a novel stimulus (mushroom or flower) 
14  Fear Learning in Infancy: An Evolutionary Developmental Perspective

paired with a different face from that seen during habituation. The rationale for this 
design was that if infants learned the pairing between face (happy or fearful) and 
snake or spider, they should look longer at a violation of this pairing than at a novel 
face with novel nonthreatening stimuli (following habituation, infants typically pre-
fer to look at novel stimuli rather than familiar ones, Hunter and Ames 1988). The 
results of this experiment revealed the infants—but only female infants—looked 
longer at the violation of the snake or spider when they had observed it paired with 
a fearful face during habituation. Female or male infants demonstrated no such 
effect for spiders or snakes that had been paired with a happy face, and a second 
experiment revealed that neither female nor male infants demonstrated this effect 
when habituated to flowers and mushrooms paired with a fearful face (Rakison, 
2009, Experiment 2).
These data suggest that female 11-month-olds, but not their male counterparts, 
readily associate snakes and spiders with a fearful stimulus. Why should such a sex 
difference exist? First, it is worth noting that adult women are four times more likely 
than men to experience fears and phobias for snakes and spiders, but this effect does 
not hold for other stimuli (e.g., injections, heights, flying) (Fredrikson et al., 1996). 
That infant girls are more likely than boys to associate snakes and spiders with fear-
ful faces suggests that this difference has its foundation in an evolved specialized 
fear-learning mechanism. This difference would have emerged as a result of the 
different selection pressures on ancestral men and women: the fitness costs on 
women for being bitten by a snake or spider would have been greater than for men 
because infants and young children are less likely to survive if a mother dies than if 
a father dies. A competing selection pressure would have been the higher reproduc-
tive variance for men: males who are fearful would likely have taken fewer risks, 
would have been less effective at hunting and fighting, and would be seen as less 
attractive long-term mates for these reasons. Thus, fear may have been selected 
against in males. Of course, it is also impossible to rule out cultural influences to 
explain this difference. In other words, it is possible that social transmission of fears 
and phobias is more common or promoted among girls than boys, such that caregiv-
ers are more likely to display fear in the presence of female infants and are more 
likely to encourage fears of snakes and spiders in female infants (Fredrikson 
et al., 1997).
More recently, Hoehl and Pauen (2017) tested whether 9-month-olds preferen-
tially associate fearful faces with recurrent threats, but in contrast to Rakison (2009) 
they used photographs of real faces and used brain measures rather than looking 
times. In the studies, infants saw a fearful or neutral face looking toward a spider or 
flower (Experiment 1) or a snake or fish (Experiment 2), and then they saw the spi-
der, flower, snake, or fish alone, and their brain response was measured using event-­
related potentials (ERPs). Hoehl and Pauen (2017) found that 9-month-old infants 
attended to objects longer—as indicated by the negative central (Nc) amplitude—
when paired with a fearful face, but this effect was larger for spiders than for flow-
ers. They also found that regardless of the facial emotion of the adults, snakes 
generated greater Nc amplitude than fish. According to the authors, the finding for 
spiders supports the prepared-learning account—preferentially learning for spiders

relative to fish—and the finding for snakes supports the nonassociative account. 
However, infants in the study showed no evidence of fear—as implied by the nonas-
sociative account—and it may be that snakes were (and continue to be) a powerful 
recurrent threat such that they elicit a greater response, regardless of the facial 
expression with which they are paired.
14.5  Limitations
The studies reported in this section suggest that infants may preferentially associate 
snakes and spiders with the emotional response of a conspecific (typically fear). 
Thus, infants orient to spiders in the presence of a fearful voice (DeLoache & 
LoBue, 2008), infant girls associate snakes and spiders with fearful faces (Rakison, 
2009), and 9-month-olds direct increased attention in the presence of a fearful face 
to spiders and to snakes more broadly. A first limitation is that, to date, there are 
only three studies that have assessed whether learned associations between recur-
rent threats and an emotion expression are privileged. Although these studies dem-
onstrate consistent findings, more research on this issue is needed to establish the 
robustness of this effect as well as to ascertain to what extent this learning is 
privileged.
A second criticism relates to real-world application. It is assumed that early 
learned associations between recurrent threats and fearful expression in some cases 
lead to the development of fear for those threats. However, none of the cited studies 
with infants (or adults) actually tested fear learning itself, partly because it is not 
ethical to teach individuals to fear things. (Thankfully, things have changed consid-
erably since Watson’s seminal work with Little Albert.) This issue is important 
because there is evidence to suggest a causal relation between an individual’s atten-
tion bias to threat and the development of anxiety in adults and children (Bar-Haim, 
2010; Fox et  al., 2007). Anxiety disorders affect up to 20% of the population 
(Bosquet & Egeland, 2006; Gross & Hen, 2004), and therefore this issue is far from 
trivial. Indeed, increased bias to threat—and subsequent learning that occurs as a 
result of this bias—can shape how individuals view the world and is linked not only 
to anxiety but to social withdrawal. Thus, it is important to establish how a bias for 
recurrent threats and early learning about those threats can have long-term effects 
on individual’s mental health.
14.6  Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, I outlined the three main theories of fear acquisition. According 
to the traditional model, fear is learned through conditioning alone; according to 
the nonassociative model, fear is present without experience; and according to 
the prepared-­learning model, fear is learned through conditioning for

nonevolutionary stimuli but is learned via a different, specialized pathway for 
recurrent threats such as snakes and spiders. I then presented my approach to fear 
learning in infancy. According to this perspective, infants’ fear learning for 
recurrent threats is underpinned by an evolved specialized mechanism that has 
two components. The first component—a perceptual template—orients infants to 
recurrent threats when they are in the environment. To support this view, I out-
lined a large database of evidence drawn from a wide range of methodologies 
that reveal that infants (as well as children, adults, and monkeys) demonstrate a 
bias to detect recurrent threats. The second component is theorized to be an asso-
ciative mechanism that offers privileged and rapid learning to link threats with an 
emotional (and perhaps, behavioral) response. To support this view, I outlined a 
smaller series of studies but that nonetheless offer a consistent and robust set of 
findings.
In conjunction, the evidence presented in this chapter supports the idea that all 
fear learning—for recurrent and nonrecurrent threats—can be explained by 
Rachman’s 3-pathway model combined with the prepared-learning model. The 
added value for the perspective presented in this chapter is that it goes some way 
to explain how infants—and children, adults, and nonhuman animals—have privi-
leged processing for recurrent threats. In other words, the prepared-learning 
model predicts that learning is privileged for a certain category of things—namely, 
recurrent threats—but it does not explain how those things are privileged in pro-
cessing. The theory I have offered here and elsewhere (LoBue & Rakison, 2013; 
Rakison 2005a, 2018: Rakison & Derringer, 2008) suggests that recurrent threats 
are privileged by virtue of a perceptual template that causes rapid detection of 
those threats, and perhaps to respond behaviorally more quickly to them (LoBue 
et al., 2014, 2017).
Because fear learning often occurs early in life, perhaps the only way to gain 
insight into this process is by adopting a developmental—and evolutionary—
approach to studying this process. The evidence presented in this chapter not only 
supports this notion but also raises many other questions. For example, it remains to 
be seen to what extent learning about recurrent threats is privileged early in life 
because only a small handful of studies have investigated this issue. In a related 
vein, many of the studies outlined here used snakes and spiders as threatening stim-
uli, but many other recurrent threats—some of which are not animals such as open 
spaces, enclosed spaces, and public speaking—remain unexamined. Moreover, it is 
as yet unknown whether there is a causal relationship between a bias for threat and 
the actual development of fear or anxiety, especially in nonclinical populations. 
Given the sensitivity of the topic—parents are not keen to have researchers teach 
their infants or children to fear things—research on this question must adopt a long-­
term longitudinal approach to gain traction on the real-world aspect of fear learning. 
However, given that research on fear learning in infants is relatively novel, it is only 
a matter of time before the pathways for fear learning for all threats—whether they 
be recurrent or not—are clearly elucidated.

Jealousy and the Terrible Twos
Sybil L. Hart
Jealousy has long been recognized as a cause of intra- and interpersonal conflict. 
Yet, the twentieth century saw changes in the way it was construed. In parallel with 
western trends toward regarding it as a sign of psychopathology when manifested in 
adults (Buss, 2000; Buss & Haselton, 2005), jealousy came to be seen as a sign of 
maladjustment in children (Stearns, 1989, 2010). The transition is thought to have 
stemmed from demographic influences involving decreases in family size. As rela-
tionships among family members became less numerous they tended to grow more 
intense, resulting in a reconfiguration of family dynamics that is thought to have 
encouraged greater parental investment in children, which was increasingly mani-
fested by concerns with mental health that included apprehension over jealousy 
(Stearns, 1989, 2010). To some extent, these concerns were outgrowths of psycho-
analytic tradition in which personality is seen as being shaped during childhood 
through processes that involve the resolution of intrafamilial rivalry; specifically 
competition with a same-sex parent (Klein, 1957, 2002; Oberndorf, 1929; Sokoloff, 
1947; Winnicott, 1977, 2002). Over time, the focus of attention shifted to concern 
over rivalry in which the competitor was a sibling rather than a parent (Adler, 1928, 
1931; Foster, 1927; Levy, 1934, 1937; McFarland, 1937; Ross, 1931; Sewall, 1930). 
Eventually, these concerns spawned literature that included ominous depictions of 
acute jealousy in the context of a newborn sibling’s arrival. In line with pronounce-
ments, such as “the coming of a new baby creates a crisis, which affects all of the 
child’s relationships – with the family and the world at large” (Levy, 1934, p. 233), 
jealousy in children came to be linked with psychopathology.
This notion was reinforced by Bowlby in his seminal work on infant-caregiver 
attachment. His volume, Attachment and Loss: Separation Anxiety and Anger 
(Bowlby, 1973), opened by discussing material that had been written by Sigmund

Freud’s daughter, Anna Freud, and Sophie Dann (Freud & Dann, 1951), in which 
they described six Jewish orphans’ rehabilitation at the conclusion of World War II 
following their liberation from harrowing conditions at Tereszin concentration 
camp. In addition to being described as highly disturbed, the children were depicted 
as “strongly possessive” and “acutely jealous” (Bowlby, 1973, p. 4). Hence, the 
linkage between psychopathology and jealousy that had been gaining prominence 
in clinical literature in the fields of social work and psychiatry eventually spread to 
mainstream developmental psychology. There it was explained in terms of contex-
tual influences and widely distilled as problem behavior that could be prevented or 
corrected by proper parenting.
The pathologized view of jealousy and views of it as the outcome of exogenous 
influences were preceded by a much longer tradition in which jealousy was 
accepted as an integral feature of human nature. Its presentation in young children 
was seen as a natural, if not inevitable, sort of human failing (Stearns, 1989, 2010). 
This charitable interpretation was expressed by Darwin (1877) in a biographical 
sketch of his son, Doddy; in which Darwin observed that “jealousy was plainly 
exhibited when I fondled a large doll, and when I weighed his infant sister, he 
being then 15 ½ months old” (p.  289). Interestingly, unlike other examples of 
Doddy’s negativity that Darwin treated in a section on the emotion of anger, jeal-
ousy was discussed in a section on the emotion of affection. Nor was Doddy 
described as being in any way flawed or disadvantaged. To the contrary, he was 
portrayed as a child who was “truthful, open, and tender, as anyone could desire” 
(Darwin, 1877, p. 292). Thus, in contrast with subsequent work that linked jeal-
ousy with maladjustment and exogenously organized risk factors, Doddy’s presen-
tation of jealousy was interpreted as an expression of love and linked with 
psychological well-being and the protective influences of a privileged environment 
and doting caregivers.
This interpretation underlines jealousy as a phenomenon that comes in a range 
of forms, even in children, and the one that is omnipresent (Cicirelli, 1995), per-
haps more like that displayed by Doddy, has received scant attention. This com-
monplace form is the focus of this chapter, and we approach it with the primary 
aim of ascertaining the potential influence of an endogenously organized element. 
The chapter starts by identifying and defining a form that can be construed as nor-
mative. Toward that end, we examine evidence that has emerged from laboratory 
research using infants. The normative form is then addressed toward insight into 
the possibility of an inherited foundation. This issue is approached by considering 
how it could have originated in ancestral infants under conditions that existed 
200,000 to 300,000 years ago, when modern humans lived in clans of nomadic 
hunters and gatherers (Galway-­Witham & Stringer, 2018). In a final section, we 
discuss jealousy’s emergence as a function of ancestral infants’ psychosocial, cog-
nitive, and motor development, and we conclude with suggestions for future 
research. Note that throughout this chapter, infants in the 12- to 36-month age 
range are referred to as toddlers.

15.1  Jealousy Protest in Infants
Our quest for evidence of an evolved foundation of jealousy in infants begins with 
efforts to identify and define a form that unfolds through a normative process of 
development. Gesell (1906) described screaming, crying, destructiveness, and 
physical aggression as evidence of “violent outbreaks of jealousy” (Gesell, 1906, 
p. 453) in infants as young as 6 months. In his account of institutionalized infants, 
Renee Spitz observed that “jealousy appears in the ninth and tenth months” (Spitz, 
1949, p. 146). These reports were precedents for an operational definition of jeal-
ousy as the infant’s presentations of negatively valenced behavior in response to an 
eliciting event in which a beloved individual, such as a parent or caregiver, directs 
attention preferentially toward a third party, such as a child (Hart, 2010, 2015; Hart 
& Carrington, 2002). This type of definition aligns with notions of jealousy in adults 
(Parrott, 1991; Pfeiffer & Wong, 1989) in that its key component, that is, the feature 
by which it is distinguished from other negatively valenced emotions that arise from 
feelings of loss, is that in the case of jealousy the loss, or perceived loss, occurs at 
the hands of a rival.
This operational definition formed the basis of laboratory procedures and experi-
mental methodology that sought to rule out the possibility that an infant’s negatively 
valenced response was due to a confounding stressor, and had indeed been precipi-
tated by a rival. This was achieved through use of a differential treatment paradigm 
that included control conditions which manipulated the object of the adult’s prefer-
ential attention and/or the nature of the adult. In the experimental jealousy-­
inducement condition, the infant’s mother held a lifelike baby doll while she and a 
stranger directed attention preferentially toward the baby doll as if it were a real 
infant. In the control conditions, the mother directed preferential attention toward a 
musical story book or the stranger directed preferential attention toward the baby 
doll. The validity of the eliciting condition has been upheld by evidence of continu-
ity in infants’ responses across the laboratory and home setting where jealousy has 
been induced by parents using a real infant (Chapman & Hart, 2017; Chapman 
et al., 2018; Szabo et al., 2014); perhaps not unlike the description of jealousy in 
Doddy, which did not seem to depend on whether Darwin had induced it by attend-
ing preferentially to a large doll or Doddy’s newborn sister.
Using these procedures, laboratory studies have consistently found that infants 
demonstrate greater negativity in the experimental condition. In 6-month-olds, it 
was characterized by facial affect of sadness and interest, suggesting desire, accom-
panied by mother-directed gaze and forward-leaning motor agitation (See Fig. 15.1). 
Facial affect of fear/wariness was fleeting; when it appeared it was more prominent 
in females (Hart & Carrington, 2002; Hart et al., 2004).
Mobile 9- to 14-month-olds’ responses in the experimental condition were char-
acterized by decreases in play, coupled with sharp increases in efforts to retain 
exclusive proximal contact with mother. These efforts consisted of negatively 
charged bids for recouping maternal attention, such as loud vocalizations, vigorous 
gesturing, swiping at the baby doll, and guarding or physical intrusion between 
15  Jealousy and the Terrible Twos

328
mother and baby doll (See Fig.  15.2). These bids were interspersed with self-­
comforting behaviors, such as sucking fingers and clinging, to help attenuate stress-­
induced dysregulation (See Fig. 15.3). This type of coping mechanism was greater 
among infants who had older siblings, and is the only known report of a distinction 
between infants who do and those who do not have siblings (Hart, 2015; Hart & 
Behrens, 2013a; Hart et al., 1998a; Mize & Jones, 2012; Mize et al., 2014).
Work with 9-month-olds that examined neurophysiological substrates of jeal-
ousy found that negativity being displayed during the experimental condition was 
associated with approach-style anterior EEG activity (Mize & Jones, 2012; Mize 
et al., 2014), which is a pattern that has been associated with the emotion of anger 
in infants (He et al., 2010). Interestingly, this EEG pattern has also been linked with 
jealousy in adults (Harmon-Jones et al., 2009). Another finding that seems parallel 
with jealousy in adults was evidence that in the experimental condition (when the 
object of maternal attention was a lifelike baby doll) versus the control condition 
(when the object of maternal attention was a children’s story book), increases in 
mothers’ positive affect were associated with decreases in infants’ positive affect 
(Hart, 2010; Hart et al., 1998a). This instance of inversed affect sharing seems con-
sistent with findings on jealousy in adults where, for example, a woman’s smile 
evokes jealousy in her husband if he perceives that the object of her smile is a rival 
(DeSteno et al., 2006; Sheets et al., 1997).
The experimental condition also elicited atypical patterns of response. Suggesting 
acute distress and reminiscent of descriptions of “violent outbreaks of jealousy” 
(Gesell, 1906, p. 453); some infants displayed disinhibited negativity, such as full-
blown temper tantrums and hostile acts against their mothers, the baby doll, and/or

themselves (which is one reason why a live infant was not used as the stimulus in 
these studies). Other responses were characterized by a contrasting pattern marked 
by suppressed emotionality and behavioral inhibition. Some infants recoiled, as if in 
fear, while others simply remained stuck in place, as if frozen with panic. Still other

atypical responses were characterized by disorganization. In some of these cases, 
infants displayed negativity, but not until the baby doll had been removed from the 
room, which was the exact opposite of the typical pattern where the rival’s removal 
and the resumption of exclusive contact with mother were usually met by a decrease, 
rather than an increase, in negativity. In rare instances, an infant would approach 
and seek succor from an unfamiliar and impassive adult (a researcher whose pres-
ence nearby was required in case an infant’s behavior could cause harm to her 
mother or herself) rather than her mother, which is a behavior that suggests indis-
criminate friendliness and is a marker of severe emotional disturbance in infants 
(Chisholm et al., 1995; Zeanah et al., 2002).
Taken together, laboratory studies discovered that the prototypic response to the 
experimental condition is the infant’s presentation of mother-directed demands for 
exclusive proximal contact, which occurs with stunning regularity. Such contact is 
accompanied by various attention-seeking behaviors for protecting exclusive access 
to mother, emotionality suggesting sadness, anger, and desire, and self-comforting 
responses for moderating levels of stress. Due to evidence that this pattern of 
response is triggered specifically by an infant’s encounter with a rival for mother’s 
exclusive attention, and in line with common usage of the label jealousy in anec-
dotal accounts (Gesell, 1906; Spitz, 1949) and in similarly designed laboratory 
research using toddlers- and preschool-aged children (Bauminger et  al., 2008; 
Szabo et al., 2014; Teti & Ablard, 1989; Volling et al., 2002), we refer to it as jeal-
ousy protest (Hart, 2015; Hart et al., 1998a).
The regularity of jealousy protest’s typical pattern of response establishes it as 
being statistically normative. Further support for this conclusion arose from evi-
dence that it was found linked with the protective influences of secure infant-mater-
nal attachment and maternal sensitivity. In stark contrast, atypical patterns were 
found associated with risk factors, including insecure quality of infant-maternal 
attachment, maternal depression, and maternal parenting behavior characterized by 
disengagement, insensitivity, and hostility (Hart, 2015; Hart et al., 1998b, 2003; 
Hart & Behrens, 2013a, b). Consistent with a central tenet of developmental psy-
chopathology that knowledge of normative development is informed by knowledge 
of atypical development (Cicchetti & Toth, 2006) – evidence that the pattern which 
is statistically typical is also positively associated with protective influences and 
negatively associated with risk factors – establishes that it is the outcome of a nor-
mative process of development.
In sum, the findings on individual differences as a function of birth order, quality 
of attachment security, and variation in the quality of maternal socialization prac-
tices showcase learning as a mechanism that plays a role in determining how jeal-
ousy protest unfolds. However, these influences do not determine if it unfolds. This 
observation led us to attribute jealousy protest to an innately based temperamental 
characteristic that we refer to as nascent jealousy (Hart, 2010, 2015; Hart & 
Carrington, 2002).

15.2  The Psychological Weapon
Like other early and easily acquired motivational states (Nesse, 1990; Ohman & 
Mineka, 2003), nascent jealousy is construed as an outcome of psychological pre-
paredness that was shaped by events that took place as modern humans arose. As for 
other evolved features of personality, it is likely to have been sculpted over deep 
time by selection pressures (Panksepp, 2010). The nature of these pressures has 
been recognized in light of thought in evolutionary developmental psychology 
(Bjorklund, 2021; Bjorklund & Yunger, 2001; Bjorklund, Chap. 2, this volume) 
that, as an evolved behavior, jealousy protest can be unpacked by examining ances-
tral habitats for life-threatening events that would have been encountered routinely 
by ancestral infants, and by then asking how these infants’ presentations of jealousy 
protest would have been adaptive toward managing that particular threat. These 
notions have called attention to the fact that jealousy protest unfolds in infants just 
as the 9-month period of human gestation concludes. Dovetailing between the con-
clusion of the human gestational period and the onset of jealousy protest has led 
us to interpret jealousy protest as a mechanism that was compelled by the life-­
threatening consequences of usurpation by a newborn sibling which could have 
been met by infants following interbirth intervals (IBIs) as brief as 9  months 
(Hart, 2016a).
Of course, mortal threats were likely to have been precipitated by events other 
than usurpation. Migration exposed humans to a wide range of conditions that 
entailed any number of mortal dangers (Simpson, 1999; Simpson & Jaeger, Chap. 
11, this volume). In addition to environmental dangers involving predation and acci-
dents (Bowlby, 1969/1984), humans would have encountered extreme climate con-
ditions that resulted in floods, drought, and famine, as well as natural disasters, such 
as epidemics and infestation, in addition to social conditions that posed threat of 
conflict and displacement. However, it seems unlikely that any of these sorts of 
dangers could have been responsible for nascent jealousy. As consequential as any 
might have been, none could have been encountered as regularly by ancestral tod-
dlers as the birth of a sibling.
Insight into this type of recurrent threat can be approached by appreciating the 
scale of its impact on toddlers’ vulnerability to morbidity and mortality. In extant 
traditional societies, where individuals live in bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers 
that resemble those of our evolutionary ancestors, almost one half of children do not 
survive. Mortality rates among children are highest among those under 5 years of 
age (Christian, 2008; Volk & Atkinson, 2008, 2013), and over half of those deaths 
involve toddlers in the 12- to 23-month age range. In fact, the probability of dying 
during the second year can match or even exceed the probability of dying in the first 
year (Dyson, 1977), which can be as great as 40% (McDowell & Volk, Chapter, 5, 
this volume). In such settings, the leading cause of death is infectious disease, and 
since malnutrition adds to the burden of disease, malnourished children are espe-
cially susceptible to disease, which can account for mortality rates that are 7 times 
greater than those of well-nourished children.
15  Jealousy and the Terrible Twos

332
Due to their immature digestive and immune systems, and the fact that these 
systems are strained further by malnourishment, toddlers are exceptionally vulner-
able to malnutrition (Alberda et al., 2006; Christian, 2008; Dyson, 1977; Khoshed 
et al., 2000; Worthman, 2010). Malnutrition in toddlers is often attributable to a 
sequence of events that starts with close birth spacing. In regions where food scar-
city is prevalent, suboptimal outcomes have frequently been observed in neonates 
and young infants as consequences of prenatal conditions in utero during preceding 
IBIs (Conde-Agudelo et al., 2006; Dadi, 2014; Kozuki & Walker, 2013; Whitworth 
& Stephenson, 2002). Importantly, some have also discovered suboptimal outcomes 
as consequences of subsequent IBIs that start at parturition. These intervals culmi-
nate upon a subsequent birth, and so they vary in duration. Those which are short in 
duration, and result in close birth spacing, are especially hazardous for toddlers 
(Bøhler & Bergström, 1995, 1996; Bøhler et al., 1995; Hailemariam & Tesfaye, 
1997; Koenig et al., 1990; St. George et al., 2000). For example, mortality rates of 
toddlers in Kenya were found doubled among those who had encountered a sib-
ling’s birth by the age of 20 months (Fotso et al., 2013). Work in Senegal reported a 
fourfold increase in mortality rates among 2-year-olds if their mothers had already 
given birth to a sibling (Ronsmans, 1996). Research conducted in Bangladesh found 
that malnutrition was increased among toddlers who had encountered the birth of a 
sibling by their second birthday (Khoshed, et al., 2000).
Dire outcomes of short subsequent IBIs are most prevalent in environments 
marked by acute food insecurity where it is customary for toddlers to be weaned 
prior to a sibling’s birth. Deprived of the nutritional and immunological benefits of 
breast milk in settings where healthy substitutes for breast milk and effective health 
systems are scarce, prematurely weaned toddlers succumb to morbidity and mortal-
ity (Christian, 2008; de Onis, 2008; Jakobsen et al., 2003; Konner, 2010; Nath et al., 
1994; Thapa et al., 1988). These tragic outcomes occur with such regularity that the 
life-threatening severe acute malnutrition disease, Kwashiorkor, takes its name 
from language spoken in Ghana that literally means, “the disease the deposed baby 
gets when the next one is born” (Williams et al., 1935, pg. 1151). In a similar vein, 
it seems likely that ancestral toddlers were not fully weaned until a subsequent IBI 
had ended or was near conclusion. At that juncture, substitutes for mothers’ milk 
were limited or entirely nonexistent (Dettwyler, 1995; Ellison, 1995). It would take 
hundreds of millennia for even substandard substitutes to become available in large 
scale through the advent of agriculture and animal husbandry during the Neolithic 
era (Bocquet-Appel, 2011; Davis, 1986).
Until that era, allomaternal breastfeeding would have been an option, but only on 
a limited basis. The hunter-gatherer clans where modern humans lived were thinly 
populated (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1989; Narvaez et al., 2014), and so lactating mothers 
could not have been numerous. Moreover, allomaternal caregiving was rarely pro-
vided to the detriment of biological offspring (Hrdy, 2007). Thus, as in harsh con-
temporary settings (Gray et al., 2002; Lancy, 2015), the few lactating mothers who 
may have been present would have been reluctant to share their precious breast milk 
with nonbiological offspring. Indeed, given the metabolic demands of breastfeeding 
two children at the same time, many contemporary traditional societies prohibit 
S. L. Hart

333
suckling more than one infant at a time. In some, giving birth to twins or the exis-
tence of an unweaned toddler has been linked to infanticide. In these cases, an 
undernourished mother can feel compelled to sacrifice one of her offspring in order 
to keep from placing both at risk of malnutrition (Daly & Wilson, 1988; Lancy, 
2015; Scrimshaw, 1984). It seems likely that similar perils and prohibitions were in 
effect in ancestral societies. Given that these customs would have kept an ancestral 
mother from suckling an additional biological child, it seems even less likely that 
she would agree to breastfeed an additional nonbiological child. Overall, it must 
have been unusual for ancestral women to divide their breast milk among biological 
or nonbiological offspring (Hart, 2016a; Chap. 7, this volume).
This had implications for ancestral infants’ relationships with their mothers who 
were sources of a constellation of salient proximate stimuli associated with breast-
feeding (Hart, Chap. 7, this volume). In addition to pleasure of satiety and physical 
well-being, the constellation included enjoyment of breast milk’s sweet taste, inti-
macy of skin-to-skin contact, as well as comfort of heat transfer and feelings of 
safety due to the common practice of breastfeeding while co-sleeping during night 
time hours when heat loss and feelings of vulnerability would have been exacer-
bated by darkness and cold. Because bed sharing was practiced universally by 
breastfeeding dyads, and because physical contact is an inherent feature of lacta-
tion, ancestral infants must have experienced proximal contact with their mothers 
for substantial amounts of time each day. Given the importance of proximal contact 
to attachment formation, affectional ties between mother and infant (Ainsworth 
et al., 1978; Bowlby, 1969/1984) would have been guaranteed by lactation, thereby 
ensuring that mothers were sources not only of breast milk but also of affection. 
Furthermore, by also being an exclusive relationship, the bond of affection could 
have endowed infants with feelings of “specialness” (Cohen, 1974, p. 207). This 
construct has been viewed as a core feature of the construct of attachment (Cohen, 
1974) that is thought to characterize nurslings’ experiences of the breastfeeding 
relationship (Bottorf, 1990) since it is still the case that women usually breastfeed 
only one infant at a time (Hart, 2016a; Chap. 7, this volume).
Conceivably, history of exclusive access to a steady source of physically and 
psychologically pleasurable care endowed infants with expectations of continuing 
to have exclusive access to their mothers for breast milk that, over deep time, co-
evolved with expectations of continuing to have unrivaled access to mother herself 
along with exquisite sensitivity to violations of those expectations. Support for this 
suggestion can be derived from evidence that ancestral infants were endowed with 
cognitive capacities that enabled the formation of expectations with regard to the 
nature of upcoming events (Buttelmann, Chap. 13, this volume). Indeed, infants 
form expectations about upcoming desirable events, and when these are violated, as 
in situations that involve goal blockage, they display anger or sadness (Lewis & 
Ramsay, 2005; Lewis et al., 1990). They also form expectations regarding the nature 
of social exchanges. Drawing on history of interactions with caregivers, they form 
expectations with respect to the nature of upcoming care. By the age of 9 months, 
infants are able to process triadic social exchanges (Buttelmann, Chap. 13, this vol-
ume; Tomasello, 2019), and so they are able to form expectations about the nature 
15  Jealousy and the Terrible Twos

334
of upcoming care that is to be directed toward infants other than themselves (Fivaz-­
Depeursinge et al., 2005; Hamlin et al., 2007; Jin et al., 2018). Interestingly, viola-
tions of such expectations precipitate disturbances (Gekoski et al., 1983; Mcquaid 
et al., 2009; Mesman et al., 2009) that are especially pronounced in infants with 
history of skin-to-skin contact with their mothers (Bigelow & Power, 2012).
Consequently, it seems tenable that by the age of 9 months, ancestral infants’ 
cognitive capacities allowed them to process history of maternal caregiving so as to 
have formed expectations of exclusivity in the infant-maternal relationship. These 
capacities would have also supported the ability to process triadic social exchanges 
involving mother and another infant, and to interpret maternal caregiving toward 
another infant as a violation of those expectations. Hence, we have proposed that 
ancestral infants’ expectations of exclusive access to their mothers represents the 
ultimate foundation of nascent jealousy, and violations of those expectations, typi-
cally upon the birth of a sibling, compelled adaptations resulting in jealousy protest, 
a behavioral mechanism, also known as a “psychological weapon” (Trivers, 1974, 
p. 249), for protecting exclusivity in the infant-maternal relationship (Hart, 2016a, b).
15.3  Jealousy Protest and the Attachment System
Jealousy protest was not the only mechanism for managing the consequences of 
usurpation. It has been construed as part of an arsenal of mother-directed protests 
that unfolded in tandem (Hart, 2018; Chap. 7, this volume). The arsenal would have 
included weaning distress, defined as protest behavior that is deployed by nurslings 
to impede breastfeeding discontinuation. Weaning distress by 12-month-olds was 
observed in Uganda by Ainsworth and Tracy (1972) who found it “as great a trauma 
as traditional psychoanalysts have always claimed weaning to be… They behaved 
like children after a traumatic institutional separation” (pp. 7–8). In modern Western 
settings where breast milk substitutes, such as commercially available formulas and 
easily digestible complementary foods, are readily available and can be delivered to 
infants by caregivers other than mothers, weaning distress is rarely as intense. This 
reality informed Ainsworth’s practical decision to turn attention from weaning dis-
tress to separation distress, a caregiver-directed presentation of protest behavior that 
was more accessible at the time and place of her writing (Bowlby, 1973; Heinicke 
& Westheimer, 1966; Robertson & Robertson, 1971). Through attention to indi-
vidual differences in infants’ responses to mothers’ departure, Ainsworth identified 
a normative pattern, which came to be recognized as secure attachment, and two 
atypical patterns, insecure-avoidant and insecure-resistant attachment (Ainsworth 
et al., 1978).
Separation protest is presented in a manner that is remarkably similar to jealousy 
protest. Both patterns of protest are caregiver directed. They also match in terms of 
their affective tone, the timing of their unfolding, and the ways in which typical and 
atypical variations are organized and patterned in relation to risk and protective 
influences. Such commonality has led to conceptualizing jealousy protest, like 
S. L. Hart

335
separation protest, as a member of a class of caregiver-directed behaviors, known as 
the attachment system. The system is theorized as having been compelled by altri-
cial infants’ dependence on caregivers’ resources for survival due to infant vulner-
ability to mortal threat (Bowbly, 1969/1984), which is a concept that has been 
interpreted in light of attention to the timing of its unfolding. Its onset in accord with 
the 9-month period of human gestation points to the possibility that the mortal threat 
responsible for the system’s unfolding was the birth of a sibling (Hart, 2016a, 2018; 
Chap. 7, this volume).
Oddly, the overlaps between jealousy protest and separation protest have led 
some to overlook distinctions. For example, in a volume on attachment and bonding 
in which Thompson and associates (2005) listed several scenarios involving behav-
ior problems that are common among young children, the list ends with a descrip-
tion of protest behavior provoked by favoritism. To explain it, the authors state, “we 
might colloquially call the latter ‘jealousy,’ the activation of attention-seeking 
behaviors” (Thompson et al., 2005, p. 355, quotes in the original). In our view, nar-
row focus on jealousy protest’s outward appearance, that is, discounting it as simply 
another example of “attention-seeking behavior,” dismisses critical distinctions that 
pertain to factors that underlie its function and adaptiveness (Campos et al., 2010; 
Frijda, 2004, 2016). Whereas the function of an attachment behavior other than 
jealousy protest is to access a primary caregiver’s resources by maintaining proxi-
mal contact with the caregiver (Bowlby, 1969/1984), jealousy protest aims to retain 
exclusive proximal contact with the caregiver. The difference between exclusive 
versus nonexclusive contact with mother was not lost on ancestral toddlers. As we 
have shown, proximal contact with mother could still have life-threatening conse-
quences for toddlers – if it was shared with a newborn sibling.
15.4  The 9-Month Revolution
The infant’s capacity to form expectations of exclusivity arises among a number of 
skills in social cognition that account for a transformation by the end of the first year 
(Moore & Dunham, 1995; Saarni et al., 2006) that is considered to be of such mag-
nitude that it is known as the 9-month social-cognitive revolution (Tomasello, 1999, 
2019). A key development involves the capacity for joint attention. This requires 
that an infant is able to look where an adult is looking by focusing on the adult’s 
eyes, to attend to movement of the adult’s gaze, and to follow it toward the object of 
the adult’s visual attention. At this point, shared attention has been achieved, which 
facilitates the infant’s capacity to process triadic exchanges. It also enables social 
referencing, which requires not only the ability to be directed to the object of an 
adult’s gaze but also the ability to be informed by the cues that the adult directs 
toward that object. For example, Boccia and Campos (1989) found that 8.5-month-­
olds’ reactions to a stranger depended on their mothers’ facial affect expressions 
when the stranger entered the room, suggesting congruence between maternal and 
15  Jealousy and the Terrible Twos

336
infant behavior as a consequence of the infant’s ability to learn from the adult sim-
ply by observing social signals, such as smiling or frowning.
Reciprocally, infants of this age have the ability to draw an adult’s attention to 
objects that are of their own interest. Toward this end, they establish eye contact 
with the adult and then lead the adult’s gaze toward the object they find of interest. 
They also exhibit communicative gestures, such as pointing to an object, and panto-
mime, such as reaching toward an adult with outstretched arms, raised as if to say, 
“pick me up” (Boccia & Campos, 1989; Moore & Dunham, 1995; Tomasello, 1999).
These skills in social cognition enable the infant’s presentation of jealousy pro-
test, which begins by tapping the capacity for joint attention so that an infant’s atten-
tion can be directed correctly to a third party, and can recognize that the third party 
is a baby. Infants must then be able to process the cues that the adult directs toward 
the baby. In order to arrive at jealousy protest, infants do not simply mirror adult 
affect, as in affect sharing, nor present congruent behavior as in social referencing. 
Rather, they must process the adult’s affect cues in light of their own expectations. 
This requires that they take into account the fact that the cues are being expressed 
by someone who is a primary caregiver and are being directed toward a baby, at 
which point the cues are interpreted as representing a violation of infants’ expecta-
tions of exclusivity. This, in turn, enables inversed affect sharing, which is illus-
trated in Fig. 15.4, where a mother’s expression of delight coincides with her infant’s 
expression of displeasure.
Jealousy protest also requires that an infant’s experience of displeasure can be 
communicated to an adult. Drawing on his skill in the use of gaze, the infant in 
Fig. 15.4 looked directly toward his mother’s eyes in an attempt to establish distal 
contact. At the same time, he communicated through gesture by reaching toward his

mother with one outstretched arm, waving it as if to say, “hey, look at me!” while 
placing the other hand on her knee, using touch to establish proximal contact as if 
to say, “we’re still connected.” Compared with unregulated presentations of jeal-
ousy protest, including melt downs colorfully depicted in clinical accounts (and also 
documented in laboratory research), jealousy protest’s normative form is sophisti-
cated and by incorporating skills in emotion regulation, as illustrated in Fig. 15.3, it 
is also measured.
The skills involved in the social-cognitive revolution are associated with another 
monumental transition, one that involves independent locomotion (Anderson et al., 
2013; Campos et al., 2000). By the age of 9 months, most infants are able to crawl. 
With new ways to explore and engage the world, infants are exposed to an expanded 
range of experiences that precipitate developmental cascades. In addition to facili-
tating advances in spatial cognition and memory, independent locomotion leads to 
experiences that stimulate social and emotional development (Anderson, 2018; 
Campos et al., 2000; Clearfield, 2011). Indeed, they enable both exclusive and non-
exclusive forms of proximal contact with mother, behaviors that are central to jeal-
ousy protest and separation protest and to formulation of the attachment system 
(Bowlby, 1969/1984; Hart, 2018).
Paradoxically, experience that is enabled by independent locomotion has also 
been implicated in a reconfiguration of the infant-maternal relationship, a transfor-
mation that has been described as “a major transition toward independence from 
caregivers” (Anderson et al., 2013, p. 14). Inquiries into upright locomotion found 
that the onset of the ability to walk is associated with increases in infant-initiated 
encounters, including increases in interaction time with mother (Biringen et al., 
1995; Clearfield, 2011; Karasik et  al., 2011) that are characterized by a rise in 
behavior described as “testing of wills” (Biringen et al., 1995, p. 511). These find-
ings call to mind early clinical reports (Gesell & Ilg, 1943; Levy, 1953) of toddlers’ 
noncompliant and oppositional behavior that Gesell and Ilg (1943) famously char-
acterized as the “terrible twos.” Their reports were later substantiated by Kopp 
(1992), who observed that maternal requests for cooperation were met by 15- to 
48-month-olds demonstrating temper tantrums and resistant behaviors in the form 
of refusals and off-task negotiations, as well as crying that peaked in the second year.
Reports of this nature spawned decades of investigative attention. In addition to 
treatment in clinical literatures, where problematic aspects of toddler behavior are 
seen as maladaptive, a growing body of research has been conducted by develop-
mental psychologists who find that some aspects of toddlers’ troublesome behaviors 
are not maladaptive (Calkins & Williford, 2009; Hughes et al., 2020; Kochanska 
et al., 2015; Nucci et al., 1996; Roberts et al., 2018). Following theorists, such as 
Erikson (1963) and Mahler (1979), and with increasing insight into bidirectional 
influences in the infant-maternal relationship (Kochanska & Aksan, 2004; Lewis & 
Rosenblum, 1974), troublesome behaviors that reflect agency and autonomy vis-à-
vis the infant-maternal relationship reflect the idea that as they enter the second 
year, infants are not merely passive recipients of adult directives. As Baillargeon 
and associates point out, “one of the most important developmental issues facing the 
toddler in the second year of life is to maintain ‘connectedness’ with the caregiver 
15  Jealousy and the Terrible Twos

338
while carrying his or her own inner aims and goals. Hence, toddlers’ deliberate 
noncompliance to parental requests, directives, and prohibitions is not, in and of 
itself, necessarily maladaptive, and many authors have stressed its adaptive nature” 
(Baillargeon et al., 2011, p. 429).
In line with this formulation, the stance shown by the infants in Figs. 15.2 and 
15.4 illustrates jealousy protest as behavior that requires that infants have acquired 
the ability to operate as autonomous agents who are able to act assertively as sources 
of influence during bidirectional exchanges with their mothers, including those that 
are confrontational. Emboldened by being equipped with these capacities, infants as 
young as these 10-month-olds are able to “stand up” for themselves, both literally 
and figuratively.
The origin of the 9-month revolution in social cognition has been attributed to an 
adaptation that was compelled by children’s ongoing need for care once weaning 
came to conclusion (Tomasello, 2020), at which point these skills would come into 
play toward enabling sociability that would be applied toward soliciting care from 
caregivers other than mother (Hrdy & Burkart, Chap. 8, this volume). Indeed, the 
increases in social interactions that emerge with infants’ growing mobility and 
autonomy also include exchanges that are positive in tone (Biringen et al., 1995; 
Brownell & Kopp, 2007; Clearfield, 2011; Karasik et  al., 2011). Yet, ancestral 
9-month-olds would not be fully weaned before the age of approximately 36 months, 
which was several years in the future, and so the abrupt onset and earliness of the 
9-month revolution in social cognition is perplexing. A possible explanation can be 
approached by noting that the timing of its onset coincides not only with a milestone 
in socioemotional development that involves the unfolding of infant-caregiver 
attachment (Bowlby, 1969/1984) but also with a milestone in motor development 
marked by the onset of independent locomotion (Campos et al., 2000). A parsimoni-
ous explanation for convergence in timing during the final quarter of the first year 
would highlight a selection pressure that unifies these milestones in socioemotional, 
sociocognitive, and motor development.
As we have shown, advances in each of these areas are requisite to the 9-month-­
old’s ability to address usurpation. Socioemotional development is responsible for 
the formation of a valued relationship, namely infant-maternal attachment, at which 
point indiscriminate sociability gives way to specific preferences for attachment 
figures (Bowlby, 1969/1984), much as jealousy protest is found greater when 
mother, rather than a stranger, directs preferential attention toward a lifelike baby 
doll (Hart et al., 1998a). Jealousy protest also requires skills in social cognition. 
These underlie the infant’s ability to form expectations with respect to the nature 
and direction of maternal caregiving and insight into violations of such expecta-
tions, as well as joint attention, communicative gesture, and the ability to grapple 
with a triadic social context so as to arrive at inversed affect sharing. Finally, it calls 
on skills in self-produced locomotion. These enable efforts to regain exclusive prox-
imal contact with mother, which is essential to infants’ efforts to defend against 
usurpation, and toward enhanced sense of agency and assertiveness by which such 
efforts are invigorated.
S. L. Hart

339
The fact that each of these milestones in socio-emotional, socio-cognitive, and 
motor development enables jealousy protest may not be coincidental. Nor is it likely 
to be coincidental that each does so by an infant’s 9th month, just as the 9-month 
period of human gestation concludes along with guarantee of exclusive access to 
mother. We propose that these milestones in development came about in tandem as 
ontogenetic adaptations (Bjorklund, 1997, 2015; Chap. 2, this volume) to threat 
posed by the birth of a sibling. Each of the skills involved would have served adap-
tively by enabling jealousy protest’s functionality as a mechanism for defending 
against the life-threatening consequences of usurpation, and did so following IBIs 
as brief as 9 months so as to prepare infants for managing a source of threat that 
would became increasingly imminent as the second year of life approached. 
Presumably, infants in whom these skills failed to unfold in time were among the 
one half of children who did not survive (McDowell & Volk, Chap. 5, this volume; 
Volk & Atkinson, 2008, 2013).
15.5  Future Research: Beyond the Terrible Twos
By the age of 36 months, ancestral infants would have encountered monumental 
changes in psychosocial functioning that were precipitated by physical maturation. 
These involved a manner of development that was observable – the eruption of 
molar teeth – and growth that was not observable – maturation of infants’ digestive 
and immune systems, which lessened their reliance on breast milk for nutrition and 
passive immunity to disease (Hart, Chap. 7, this volume). The appearance of full 
dentition would have been interpreted by ancestral mothers as a sign that their 
infants’ metabolic requirements could be satisfied without breastfeeding, which 
prompted them to bring weaning to conclusion. The nonobservable developments 
would have allowed mothers to do so without causing serious harm to their chil-
dren’s chances of survival (Dettwyler, 1995; Humphrey, 2010; Kennedy, 2005; 
Locke & Bogin, Chap. 6, this volume; Stuart-Macadam, 1995; Tsutaya & Yoneda, 
2015). At this juncture, vulnerability to malnutrition and morbidity would have been 
diminished – along with weanlings’ dependence on maternal caregiving – and so 
exclusive access to mother was less likely to be a matter of life or death (Hart, Chap. 
7, this volume). Thus, it is unclear whether jealousy protest continued to play a role 
in 36-month-olds as it had since they reached the age of 9 months, when guaranteed 
access to mothers’ milk expired.
Some insight into nascent jealousy’s continuing role has come to light through 
longitudinal research on continuity in children’s responses to differential treatment. 
Studies that explored presentations of jealousy protest in toddlers and preschoolers 
following a sibling’s birth found that their responses did not differ from those that 
they had exhibited prior to the sibling’s arrival in a laboratory procedure which took 
place during their mothers’ final trimester of pregnancy (Chapman & Hart, 2017; 
Chapman et al., 2018; Szabo et al., 2014). Such evidence of stability seems to sug-
gest that nascent jealousy continues to exert influence beyond infancy.
15  Jealousy and the Terrible Twos

340
It is also notable that evidence of jealousy protest has been documented in labo-
ratory studies where it was induced in infants, toddlers, and preschoolers by moth-
ers directing attention preferentially toward siblings (Teti & Ablard, 1989; Volling 
et al., 2002); twins (Gewirtz & Pelaez-Nogueras, 1999); younger, older, and same-­
aged peers (Bauminger, 2010; Bauminger et al., 2008; Draghi-Lorenz et al., 2001; 
Masciuch & Kienapple, 1993); and spouses (Cummings et al., 1981). It has also 
been observed in settings where differential treatment was exhibited by fathers 
(Miller et al., 2000; Szabo et al., 2014; Volling et al., 2002). These studies were 
conducted in the United States, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Israel, by 
different teams of researchers, using samples from different social classes. The 
unequivocal results uphold the idea that jealousy is an omnipresent phenomenon 
among siblings (Cicirelli, 1995), and that exclusivity is a feature of valued relation-
ships that extend beyond the infant-maternal relationship and reaches across cul-
tures and social classes, which suggests that it is a robust phenomenon. Such 
robustness lends weight to thought that children’s sensitivity to differential treat-
ment by a parent is to some degree innately based. We believe that future research 
on children’s responses to differential treatment that incorporate longitudinal 
approaches stands to yield insight into nascent jealousy as a mechanism that contin-
ues to function across age and valued relationships among children past the age of 
36 months.
Of course, such approaches will find that presentations of jealousy protest differ 
with child age. Evidence suggests that it also differs with marker variables, such as 
gender and birth order (Hart & Behrens, 2013a; Hart et al., 2004), and depends on 
whether it is elicited by mother versus father (Miller et al., 2000; Szabo et al., 2014; 
Volling et al., 2002), and with experiences related to qualities of maternal caregiv-
ing (Hart et al., 1998b, 2003). These findings point to the contributions of child 
characteristics involving maturation of socioemotional, cognitive, and motor func-
tioning, as well as contextual influences, such as parenting practices. Continued 
investigative attention to the exceptionally wide range of individual differences that 
result stands to help isolate endogenous influences from those which are organized 
by exogenous influences.
Efforts to address individual differences also stand to establish an empirical basis 
for defining a form of jealousy in children which can be upheld as normative. In 
addition to illuminating a feature of infants and children that is ubiquitous, yet 
poorly understood, doing so opens possibilities for addressing innately based 
aspects of jealousy that help account for its enduringness beyond its roots in ances-
tral settings. We believe that work along these lines will shed light on nascent jeal-
ousy’s origin within the context of exclusive infant-maternal relationships, as well 
as the pathways along which it unfolded in an adaptive fashion in children in ances-
tral settings, where they navigated complex social environments, marked by multi-
ple supradyadic relationships that called upon skills in both cooperation (Hrdy, 
2005; Hrdy & Burkart, Chap. 8, this volume; Tomasello, 2020) and competition 
(Bjorklund & Pellegrini, 2002; Myers & Bjorklund, 2018; Trivers, 1974).

Caring for Others: The Early Emergence 
of Sympathy and Guilt
Amrisha Vaish and Tobias Grossmann
Humans have evolved to be highly social and cooperative beings. Our survival 
and success depend on living and cooperating with one another, such as by helping 
people in need, working together to build shelters and find food, assisting each other 
with childcare, and so forth. This interdependence is argued to have come about in 
our evolutionary history in response to environmental pressures that required 
humans to band together, collaborate, and cooperate to achieve the most funda-
mental tasks (Tomasello, 2016). Our reliance on others meant, in turn, the need to 
ensure the well-being of those with whom we were  – or could potentially 
be – interdependent.
Although this account explains human prosociality at the ultimate level (i.e., why 
prosociality emerged), it does not do so as the proximate level (i.e., what causes an 
individual to behave prosocially). After all, prosocial behavior involves a greater 
loss for the actor, who typically invests resources such as time, energy, or material 
resources, than for the receiver, who gains benefits without having invested their 
own resources. This raises a vital question: If individuals who act prosocially stand 
to lose more than the individuals whom they benefit, how can prosocial behavior be 
maintained? Why would an individual ever put aside their selfish interests to bene-
fit others?
One part of the answer is that natural selection has favored a wide range of psy-
chological adaptations that help us solve this dilemma at the proximate level. In 
particular, we have evolved emotional mechanisms that help us detect and respond 
prosocially toward those who need help or are suffering, thereby protecting the 
well-being of those whom we (might) rely on (Fessler & Haley, 2003; Frank, 1988). 
This view aligns with the functional approach to emotions more generally, wherein 
emotions are seen as adaptations that motivate us to behave in ways that help us 
solve challenges of adaptive and social import (Campos et al., 1989; Darwin, 1872;

Keltner & Haidt, 1999; Nesse, 1990). We further propose that these emotional 
mechanisms appear early in ontogeny and, thus, allow even the youngest members 
of our species to promote others’ welfare and thereby foster cooperation (Bjorklund, 
2018; Vaish & Hepach, 2020).
Our focus in this chapter is on two emotional mechanisms that we argue are 
essential for this purpose: sympathy and guilt. Sympathy involves feeling concern 
for those in need or distress, and it motivates us to alleviate the need or distress of 
those individuals (Eisenberg et al., 2006). Thus, sympathy moves us to promote the 
welfare of those with whom we are or could be interdependent. We review recent 
evidence demonstrating that, in contrast to what has long been believed, infants 
experience sympathy for others from the very first postnatal year, and this sympathy 
motivates their prosocial behavior by the second year. Moreover, by the second 
year, children respond with sympathy that is flexible and appropriate to the situa-
tion, rendering sympathy a reliable and powerful prosocial mechanism from 
early on.
Guilt is prototypically experienced when one has caused another’s need or dis-
tress and promotes reparative and prosocial behavior toward that individual 
(Hoffman, 2000; Vaish, 2018). Thus, guilt not only promotes others’ welfare but 
additionally repairs ruptures in our cooperative relationships. We review evidence 
that guilt serves these critical functions by the third year of life, thereby enabling 
even young children to safeguard valuable relationships. We end the chapter with 
caveats to our account and open questions and predictions that emerge from the 
evolutionary account of early sympathy and guilt.
16.1  Sympathy
Perhaps the most foundational affective mechanism underlying prosocial behavior 
is empathic responding, which includes empathy (an affective response to another’s 
emotional state and congruent with the other’s emotional state) and sympathy (the 
feeling of concern about the welfare of another person in need or distress) (Batson, 
1991; Eisenberg et al., 2006; Hoffman, 2000; Marsh, 2015). Though empathy and 
sympathy are related processes, they are separable, and it is sympathy rather than 
empathy that is linked to prosocial action (Bloom, 2017; Jordan et al., 2016).
One major proponent of empathic responding as an evolved altruistic motive is 
Martin Hoffman, who argued that such responding is a species-wide phenomenon 
that gives observers quick and direct access to the suffering of others and motivates 
prosocial behavior to alleviate that suffering (Hoffman, 2000, 2007). Hoffman fur-
ther laid out an influential developmental account in which he proposed that 
empathic responding is rooted in the emotional contagion seen soon after birth, 
wherein infants automatically cry in response to other infants’ cries (e.g., Sagi & 
Hoffman, 1976; Simner, 1971). Around 12–14 months of age, infants show “ego-
centric empathic distress,” in which they respond to another’s distress as if they 
themselves were in distress. This is argued to occur because, although infants at this 
A. Vaish and T. Grossmann

351
age can feel empathic distress, they still lack a clear differentiation between self and 
other (Hoffman, 2000). Hoffman proposed that true empathy emerges in the second 
half of the second year, when children more fully differentiate between self and 
other and thereby understand that others are separate beings (as evident in their 
capacity to recognize themselves in the mirror; Lewis et al., 1991). With this impor-
tant cognitive development, toddlers realize that others have independent inner 
states, and they now begin to show not only empathy but also sympathy. Thus, tod-
dlers often respond to those in distress with facial and verbal expressions of sympa-
thy and prosocial actions such as helping and comforting, and their expressions of 
sympathy predict how prosocial they are (Bischof-Köhler, 1991; Eisenberg & 
Fabes, 1998; Svetlova et al., 2011; Zahn-Waxler et al., 1992).
Moreover, this early sympathy is genuinely prosocial: Young children’s primary 
motivation appears to be to see the person in need be helped. For instance, a series 
of studies has used pupillometry to tap into toddlers’ internal arousal upon seeing 
someone in need. Pupillometry is the measure of the dilation of the eyes’ pupils. 
Systematic changes in pupil size reflect  activation of the sympathetic branch of the 
autonomous nervous system and are indicative of experienced internal arousal 
(Bradley et al., 2008; Hepach & Westermann, 2016; Loewenfeld, 1993), and have 
recently been shown to index children’s motivation to help. Specifically, by 
1.5–2 years of age, children’s pupils dilate in response to seeing others in need of 
help, and the greater the increase, the likelier and faster children are to subsequently 
provide help to that person (Hepach et al., 2012a, 2016, 2019). The striking finding 
relevant to children’s prosocial motivation is that children’s pupil dilation returns to 
baseline both when they are able to provide help and when they simply watch some-
one else provide help, indicating that their motivation is not to be the ones to help 
and, thus, receive credit for helping but rather to see the person receive help (Hepach 
et al., 2012a, 2017a). This is in line with the finding that toddlers help others anony-
mously and thus without any social recognition for helping (Hepach et al., 2017).
Toddlers’ primary motivation is also not simply to see the physical order of 
things be restored. Recent findings showed that toddlers’ pupillary arousal was only 
reduced in a social condition, in which a person received the object they needed to 
complete a task, but not in a nonsocial condition, in which the identical physical 
event occurred but without anyone present (Hepach et al., 2016). Moreover, both 
toddlers and preschoolers are more likely to hand a person the object they actually 
need rather than an irrelevant object or the object the person is reaching for but, 
unbeknownst to that person, is in fact broken and would thus not serve their purpose 
(Hepach et al., 2016, 2020; Martin et al., 2016; Martin & Olson, 2013).
Finally, there is evidence that acting prosocially is emotionally rewarding, even 
for very young children. For instance, cross-cultural research indicates that giving 
away treats makes toddlers happier than receiving treats, and, strikingly, costly giv-
ing makes them happier than noncostly giving (Aknin et al., 2015; Aknin et al., 
2012). Further, toddlers’ body posture is elevated as much after helping another 
person to achieve a goal as when toddlers achieve a goal themselves (Hepach et al., 
2017b). This suggests that helping another person results in a positive and poten-
tially rewarding emotional state in young children, which likely serves as a potent

352
motivator for future prosocial actions (see Aknin et al., 2018). All in all, there is now 
substantial evidence that by age 2 years, children are genuinely invested in and 
motivated to improve the welfare of others.
16.1.1  Sympathy in Infancy
Until recently, Hoffman’s proposal that infants could not respond with true sympa-
thy for others until about 1.5 years of age due to limitations in their self-other dif-
ferentiation was widely accepted. As such, younger infants’ responding to emotional 
expressions in others has generally been dismissed as “immature” emotional conta-
gion. However, this pervasive view has recently been put into question, for a few 
reasons. First, cross-cultural work has not supported the universality of the associa-
tion between mirror self-recognition and empathic responding (Kärtner et al., 2010). 
Second, although a conceptual, reflective self-awareness may not emerge until late 
in the second year, there is now substantial evidence that an implicit sense of self as 
distinct from others is present even in newborns (see Davidov et al., 2013). And 
finally, newer empirical work shows that sympathy for distressed others does not 
first appear during the second year; rather it is evident within the first few months 
after birth and increases only modestly with age, whereas prosocial behavior first 
appears only during the second year (Davidov et al., 2013, 2020; Roth-Hanania 
et al., 2011). Importantly, infants’ sympathy in the first year predicts their prosocial 
behavior in the second year, suggesting that early sympathy does indeed signal a 
prosocial motivation, even if infants in their first year do not yet have the knowhow 
or skills to alleviate others’ distress (Davidov et al., 2020; Roth-Hanania et al., 2011).
Researchers have also recently begun to explore other affective mechanisms 
beyond emotional contagion that may serve as foundations for early sympathy. In 
particular, the rich and growing body of research on emotion processing during 
infancy has proved fruitful. This research shows that infants competently detect, 
discriminate, and integrate emotional expressions from others’ faces, voices, and 
bodies (Grossmann, 2012, 2015; Missana et al., 2015; Rajhans et al., 2016b). One 
emotional expression that is of particular interest with respect to sympathy and pro-
social behavior is fear (Marsh, 2015). Facial fear displays are commonly classified 
and used as threat stimuli (Vuilleumier, 2006). However, research on the psychol-
ogy of prosociality has shown that, in adulthood, the capacity to help and benefit 
others is intimately tied to processes that make us recognize and care about others’ 
emotional displays of distress as exemplified in fearful faces (Marsh & Ambady, 
2007; Marsh & Blair, 2008; Marsh et al., 2007; Marsh et al., 2014). In fact, there is 
evidence that extremely antisocial psychopaths and extremely prosocial individuals 
show substantial differences in fear processing and may thus represent opposite 
ends of a caring continuum (Marsh, 2015). Specifically, when compared to a control 
group, anonymous kidney donors show increased neural and behavioral sensitivity 
to seeing others in distress (fearful faces) (Marsh et al., 2014). In contrast, psycho-
paths exhibit decreased sensitivity to fearful faces when compared to control 
A. Vaish and T. Grossmann

353
individuals (Marsh & Blair, 2008). Moreover, research with a typical population of 
adults shows that better recognition of fear from faces is associated with higher 
levels of prosocial behavior (Marsh & Ambady, 2007; Marsh et al., 2007). Taken 
together, this line of research with adults strongly suggests that variability in 
responding to fearful faces is linked to variability in prosocial behavior, raising the 
question of when this link emerges in development.
One recent study demonstrated that heightened sensitivity to fearful faces is 
linked to enhanced prosocial behavior among 5-year-old children in two different 
cultures (Rajhans et al., 2016a). In this study, children in both India and Germany 
who were quicker to orient to fearful faces displayed greater prosocial behavior in a 
dictator game. Thus, the fundamental link between variability in responding to fear 
in others and prosocial behavior already exists in preschool-age children. Note, 
however, that the ability to detect and sensitively respond to various emotional 
facial expressions including fear emerges during the first year of life (Grossmann, 
2012). Specifically, by around 7  months of age, human infants begin to show 
increased neural and behavioral (attentional) responses to fearful faces and distin-
guish them from other positive and negative facial expressions (Grossmann & 
Jessen, 2017; Jessen & Grossmann, 2014, 2016; Krol et al., 2015; Peltola et al., 
2009). Given this evidence from behavioral and neuroscience research, infancy can 
be considered a sensitive developmental period during which fear processing skills 
come online. The question thus arises: Can understanding individual differences in 
responsiveness to fearful faces during this sensitive period in ontogeny provide 
insights into the foundations of sympathy and prosocial behavior in human 
development?
Recent research suggests it can. In one recent study, variability in neural 
responses (measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy) and attentional 
responses (measured by eye tracking) to fearful faces at age 7 months predicted 
prosocial behavior at 14 months (Grossmann et al., 2018). Importantly, this associa-
tion was selective: Only responsiveness to fearful faces – not to happy or angry 
faces – predicted prosocial behavior. This finding is noteworthy because it estab-
lishes a clear link to existing work with adults (Marsh, 2015), showing that fear 
processing is selectively linked to prosocial responding from early in ontogeny. 
More generally, this and the other recent findings on infants’ fear processing criti-
cally extend the existing work on emotional contagion by supporting the idea that 
responsiveness to fear in others can be seen as a key marker and ontogenetic predic-
tor of prosocial action among humans.
Taken together, the research with young infants described above shows that not 
just the precursors to empathic responding but also true sympathy for others is evi-
dent very soon after birth. Of note, although these findings contradict the specific 
developmental model proposed by Hoffman, they do support his broader and key 
argument that human infants come to the world prepared to care about the welfare 
of others and to become affectively involved in others’ suffering (Hoffman, 1981, 
2000, 2007).
16  Caring for Others: The Early Emergence of Sympathy and Guilt

354
16.1.2  Flexible Sympathy
A further crucial aspect of Hoffman’s proposal was the idea that “natural selection 
requires an altruistic response system that is reliable and yet also flexible” (Hoffman, 
1981, p. 127). In other words, the most effective and reliable prosocial motive from 
an evolutionary standpoint would be one that had a deep biological basis but was 
also flexible rather than automatic and fixed, and was amenable to cognitive control 
so as to differentiate when concern and prosocial behavior are feasible and war-
ranted and when they are not. Research over the past several years bolsters this 
proposal, demonstrating that empathic responding is indeed flexible and amenable 
to control, even in early childhood (see Vaish, 2016).
First, empathy-related responses have been found to be multidetermined, that is, 
elicited in response to whatever cues are available, even in the absence of percepti-
ble distress. Some early experiments tackled this question using assessments of 
pictures and stories (Iannotti, 1985). Preschool-aged children heard about protago-
nists in emotion-eliciting situations but were not given information about the pro-
tagonists’ feelings. Because many of the children reported emotions that matched 
the protagonists’ presumed emotions, they were believed to have empathized by 
taking the protagonists’ perspective. However, children participating in these tasks 
may instead provide what they believe are the correct responses, or responses they 
believe the experimenter wants to hear (Eisenberg et  al., 2006). Furthermore, 
because they require sophisticated cognitive and linguistic skills, they limit the ages 
that researchers can test.
More recent research addresses these problems. In one study, 1.5- and 2-year-­
olds saw one adult either harming another adult (e.g., tearing the other adult’s pic-
ture) or behaving neutrally (e.g., tearing a blank paper). In both cases, the second 
adult observed the event neutrally, without displaying emotion. Nevertheless, chil-
dren showed greater sympathy for the adult if her picture was torn (i.e., she was 
harmed), and subsequently behaved more prosocially toward her. Furthermore, 
individual children’s sympathy correlated with their later prosocial behavior (Vaish 
et al., 2009; procedure adapted from Hobson et al., 2009). Children’s sympathy 
could not have been elicited by affective resonance with the victim’s distress because 
the victim showed no overt distress. Rather, children must have relied on a different, 
more top-down cognitive process such as affective perspective taking.
Extending this work, another study (Chiarella & Poulin-Dubois, 2015) examined 
18-month-olds’ responses to a victim displaying a neutral or sad expression. As in 
the work described earlier (Vaish et al., 2009), infants in this study showed sympa-
thy for the neutral victim; however, they showed more sympathy for the sad victim, 
suggesting that although situational cues alone can generate sympathy, overt cues of 
distress intensify that sympathy. Although this is likely true, the critical point for our 
purposes is that 1.5-year-olds sympathized with a victim even in the absence of 
conspicuous distress. Whether this is true at younger ages remains unanswered. 
A. Vaish and T. Grossmann

355
Vaish et al. (2009) did also test 14-month-olds using the same procedure, but these 
younger infants did not fully grasp the situations presented. With simpler events, 
perhaps even younger infants could demonstrate multidetermined sympathy. 
However, current research suggests that this ability emerges around 18 months.
Second, research demonstrates that early empathic responding can be controlled 
based upon contextual information. In one study, 3-year-olds showed greater sym-
pathy for an adult displaying justified distress (his hand was caught in a box) than 
unjustified distress (his sleeve was caught) (Hepach et al., 2012b). Children also 
helped the justifiably distressed adult more quickly, and the more sympathy children 
expressed, the more quickly they helped the adult. In more recent work, 18-month-­
olds also showed more sympathy for an adult who was justifiably distressed than for 
one who was unjustifiably distressed, whereas 15-month-olds did not react in this 
way (Chiarella & Poulin-Dubois, 2013). The 15-month-olds also did not look lon-
ger at the situations in which the adult displayed unjustified distress, suggesting that 
infants of this age do not yet engage in contextual appraisal. Alternatively, they may 
not have enough experience with the kinds of situations used in the study to appraise 
them relative to the emotional response. As with multidetermined sympathy, 
context-­dependent sympathy based on appraising context may also emerge around 
18 months.
In summary, humans appear to enter the world ready to be drawn into others’ 
suffering and, as recent work shows, to feel concern for others’ suffering. This con-
cern has a genuinely prosocial flavor, as is evident in the emergence of prosocial 
behavior as soon as infants are motorically and sociocognitively capable of such 
behavior and in the satisfaction that toddlers seem to derive from seeing others 
receive the help they need. Furthermore, early sympathy meets the requirements 
that Hoffman argued natural selection would have for an altruistic response system: 
It is multidetermined and therefore reliable, yet also amenable to cognitive control 
and therefore flexible (Hoffman, 1981; Vaish, 2016). From very early in life, then, 
sympathy serves as a foundational and powerful proximate mechanism to promote 
humans’ prosocial tendencies.
16.2  Guilt
Sympathy for another’s distress can occur both when one is an uninvolved bystander 
who witnesses the other’s distress (i.e., in a third-party interaction) or when one has 
caused the other’s distress (i.e., in a dyadic context). In the latter case, sympathy for 
the person in distress combined with the awareness of being the cause of that dis-
tress can lead to the aversive emotion of guilt (Hoffman, 1976). Guilt focuses atten-
tion on the action and the harm done (or help not given) to the other, inflicts 
subjective discomfort on the actor due to its unpleasant valence, and crucially, moti-
vates the actor to make amends by aiding or otherwise compensating the victim. 
16  Caring for Others: The Early Emergence of Sympathy and Guilt

356
Thus, guilt is tuned to identifying and reversing the damage done to a cooperative 
relationship (Baumeister et al., 1994).1
Guilt has long been shown to serve these functions among adults (e.g., Brock & 
Becker, 1966; Cunningham et al., 1980; Ketelaar & Au, 2003; Regan et al., 1972). 
For instance, college students who believed they had caused someone great harm 
(and, thus, presumably felt guilty) were later more likely to help that individual than 
students who believed they had caused only minor harm (Brock & Becker, 1966). 
Similarly, individuals in another study who were made to feel guilty after behaving 
uncooperatively in a decision-making game were more likely to behave coopera-
tively on subsequent rounds of the game than people who did not feel guilty 
(Ketelaar & Au, 2003). Guilt, thus, goes beyond the general prosocial motivation 
created by sympathy; it specifically increases the motivation to make amends or to 
otherwise compensate the person one has harmed, thereby helping to repair and 
sustain one’s valuable cooperative relationships.
16.2.1  Feelings of Guilt
Guilt begins to serve these vital prosocial functions from remarkably early in ontog-
eny. Some work indicates that following minor transgressions (e.g., accidentally 
breaking someone’s favorite doll), children as young as 2 years show signs of guilt 
such as accepting responsibility and attempting to repair the damage (Drummond 
et al., 2017; Kochanska et al., 1995; Zahn-Waxler & Kochanska, 1990). Though 
suggestive, these studies are inconclusive because it is unclear whether they tapped 
into guilt specifically or into related but distinct processes. In particular, guilt is 
composed of two critical components: sympathy for a victim of harm and the aware-
ness that one has caused that harm (Hoffman, 1982). Neither component is by itself 
sufficient for guilt, yet each component separately can motivate repair. For instance, 
when children harm someone, their reparative behavior could either arise from sym-
pathy alone – without any recognition that they caused the harm, or from the recog-
nition that they caused the outcome and the desire to fix it – without any sympathy. 
Thus, to study the prosocial effects of guilt specifically, we must use controlled 
experiments that can tease these processes apart.
Toward this end, we recently compared 2-year-old and 3-year-old children’s 
reparative behavior after they caused a harmful outcome (guilt condition), someone 
1 Guilt is often confused with the related social emotions of shame and embarrassment. However, 
though all three emotions are elicited by transgressions, they are distinct in critical ways. Guilt 
pertains to one’s harmful actions and motivates reparative behavior, which benefits one’s relation-
ships. On the other hand, shame involves feelings that the whole self is a failure and thus leads one 
to withdraw from social contact rather than to repair, and embarrassment generally follows trans-
gressions of social conventions rather than moral transgressions (Keltner & Buswell, 1996). Guilt 
is thus considered the quintessential moral emotion – one that plays a critical role in restoring and 
maintaining cooperation (though see Sznycer, 2019).
A. Vaish and T. Grossmann

357
else caused the harmful outcome (sympathy condition), or children or someone else 
caused the same outcome but in a nonharmful context (Vaish et al., 2016). Three-­
year-­olds (but not 2-year-olds) showed greater verbal and physical reparative behav-
ior in the guilt condition than in the other conditions. This design enabled us to 
isolate the effects of guilt from its component processes and to show that the repara-
tive motivation created by guilt is greater than that created only by sympathy or only 
by the desire to undo an unwanted but nonharmful outcome. We thus demonstrated 
that early in development, guilt distinctly serves to motivate children’s reparative 
behavior.
In a different approach to this question, we examined whether after harming 
someone, children are especially motivated to repair the harm themselves – because 
they recognize that they need to fix the relationship that they damaged. Using pupil 
dilation to measure internal arousal, we found that 3-year-olds’ (and more weakly, 
2-year-olds’) arousal decreased when they were able to repair damage that they had 
caused, but remained high if someone else repaired damage that the children had 
caused (Hepach et al., 2017a). However, if children had not caused the damage, then 
their arousal was similarly reduced when they or someone else repaired it. Thus, as 
bystanders, children are primarily motivated to see a person in need be helped 
regardless of who provides the help (see also Hepach et al., 2012a). Guilt alters this 
motivation such that children not only want the harmed individual to be helped but 
also want to be the helpers – as a way of repairing and showing commitment to the 
disrupted relationship.
All in all, by 3 (perhaps even 2) years of age, children recognize when they have 
caused harm and are motivated to repair that harm and restore their ruptured rela-
tionships. Thus, there seems to be an early preparation to experience guilt after 
causing harm, which helps even young children maintain cooperation from early in 
development.
16.2.2  Displays of Guilt
Interestingly, guilt is also thought to serve crucial social functions when it is dis-
played by a transgressor (see Keltner & Haidt, 1999). A prevailing view is that guilt 
displays serve appeasement functions by communicating vital information to vic-
tims and bystanders. They communicate that the transgressor is also suffering 
(Keltner & Anderson, 2000; Leary et al., 1996), the transgressor did not mean harm 
and is not generally the kind of person that means harm (McGraw, 1987), and the 
transgressor intends to make amends and behave more appropriately in the future 
(Castelfranchi & Poggi, 1990). A remorseful transgressor is, thus, seen as self-­
policing, dependable, and cooperative, and elicits forgiveness, affiliation, and coop-
eration from victims and bystanders (Darby & Schlenker, 1982, 1989; Goffman, 
1967). Among adults, guilt displays do serve these functions. For instance, victims 
positively evaluate and show reduced aggression toward an apologetic transgressor 
16  Caring for Others: The Early Emergence of Sympathy and Guilt

358
(Ohbuchi et al., 1989), and bystanders state that remorseful transgressors need not 
make as many restitutions as unremorseful ones (O’Malley & Greenberg, 1983).
A sizable body of work shows that guilt displays also serve these functions in 
childhood. Some work has explored children’s responses to apologies, which are 
admissions of blameworthiness and regret and, thus, a stand-in for guilt. When 4- to 
8-year-olds hear stories about transgressions, they blame and punish the transgres-
sor less, and forgive and like her more if she apologized than if she did not apologize 
(Darby & Schlenker, 1982, 1989; Smith et al., 2010). They also judge situations in 
which a transgressor apologized as more just and attribute improved feelings to a 
victim who received an apology (Irwin & Moore, 1971; Smith et al., 2010; Wellman 
et al., 1979). A similar pattern emerges when children are themselves the victims. 
For instance, 4- to 7-year-olds who suffered minor transgressions reported feeling 
better, rated the transgressor as being nicer, and were more prosocial toward the 
transgressor if she apologized (Drell & Jaswal, 2016; Smith & Harris, 2012). 
Apologies are, thus, effective elicitors of preschool-aged children’s forgiveness and 
prosociality.
Note, however, that from an early age, children are heavily prompted to apolo-
gize, even when they might not feel sorry (Smith et al., 2017). Children’s positive 
evaluations of apologetic transgressors may, thus, be based on hearing key words 
they expect to hear (“sorry”) rather than on the remorse as such. To account for this, 
recent work has examined children’s responses to transgressors’ remorse in the 
absence of explicit apologies. In one study, 4- and 5-year-olds watched two videos 
of third-party transgressions. One transgressor was remorseful without explicitly 
apologizing (“I did not mean to do that. It’s my fault.”), whereas the other was neu-
tral and unremorseful (Vaish et al., 2011). Five-year-olds preferred and distributed 
more resources to the remorseful than the unremorseful transgressor, whereas 
4-year-olds showed no systematic preference or distribution pattern. In a follow-up 
study, when the transgressor apologized explicitly (“sorry”), 4-year-olds did prefer 
and distribute more resources to her. Very similar results emerged in a more recent 
study in which children were themselves the victims (Oostenbroek & Vaish, 2019). 
Thus, by age 5, children respond positively and with greater cooperation toward 
remorseful transgressors; a year earlier, children show a similar appreciation when 
transgressors provide conventional cues of remorse such as explicit apologies.
In sum, guilt serves vital prosocial functions from early in ontogeny. By 
2–3 years, children experience guilt about causing harm: they show nonverbal and 
verbal signs of guilt and are motivated to repair the damage. By 4–5 years, children 
respond favorably to transgressors’ displays of guilt: they positively evaluate and 
are more prosocial toward remorseful transgressors. At age 4, these responses hinge 
on the transgressor using conventional phrases such as “sorry,” but by age 5, even 
remorse without such phrases elicits these responses.
Why might the experience of guilt motivate prosociality earlier than guilt dis-
plays? In part, this discrepancy might be a methodological byproduct. Since studies 
on children’s responses to guilt displays involve asking children interview questions 
(which very young children find challenging), these studies have not generally 
assessed children younger than age 4. However, one study that included 3-year-olds 
A. Vaish and T. Grossmann

359
found that they did not evaluate apologetic transgressors more positively than non-
apologetic ones (Wellman et al., 1979). Children’s appreciation of guilt displays 
may thus only emerge around 4 years. Why might this be the case? One proposal is 
that as guilt has no single facial expression and is instead expressed through actions 
such as confessions, apologies, and repair (Keltner & Buswell, 1996; Zahn-Waxler 
& Kochanska, 1990), young children might have a hard time identifying it in others. 
By age 4, they have the capacity and sufficient experience to identify and respond to 
the most common sign of remorse (apologies), and by age 5, to other, less-common 
signs of remorse as well. Be that as it may, it is interesting to consider that the earlier 
emergence of children’s own expressions of guilt may serve children well by 
appeasing others and lessening the negative consequences that children might oth-
erwise receive for their transgressions. Thus, children might benefit from displaying 
their own guilt substantially earlier than they respond positively to such displays 
in others.
16.3  Conclusions, Caveats, and Future Directions
Human survival and success depends on banding together, collaborating, and coop-
erating with one another (Tomasello, 2016). This interdependence has meant, in 
turn, the need to ensure the well-being of our (potential) cooperation partners. We 
argue that natural selection has favored emotional mechanisms that, at the proxi-
mate level, help us detect and respond prosocially toward those who need help or 
are suffering. Moreover, these emotional mechanisms appear early in ontogeny and, 
thus, allow even the youngest members of our species to promote others’ welfare 
and thereby foster cooperation (Bjorklund, 2018; Vaish & Hepach, 2020).
We focused in this chapter on two such mechanisms that are essential for this 
purpose: sympathy and guilt. Both mechanisms are evident remarkably early in 
development. Sympathy is seen as early as 3 months of age and seems to rest on 
multiple emotional processes including affective contagion and fear processing. 
Furthermore, early sympathy is both reliable and flexible, meeting Hoffman’s 
requirements for an evolved altruistic response system (Hoffman, 1981). Building 
on this foundation of sympathy and a basic sense of causality or agency, a nascent 
guilt emerges between 2 and 3 years of age. Critically, both mechanisms serve the 
proposed prosocial functions, with sympathy predicting prosocial behavior (both 
concurrently and longitudinally) by 12–14  months of age and guilt motivating 
reparative behavior by age 3 years. Somewhat later in development, others’ displays 
of guilt also serve important reparative functions by appeasing victims and observ-
ers and eliciting cooperation. Together, these early-emerging emotional mecha-
nisms highlight the ways in which humans are prepared to be drawn into others’ 
suffering, to act on others’ behalf, to repair their valuable social relationships, and 
to identify who is or is not likely to be a good cooperative partner.
16  Caring for Others: The Early Emergence of Sympathy and Guilt

360
There are, of course, important caveats and supplements to this account, as well 
as important questions that remain open. We consider some of these in the remain-
der of this chapter.
16.3.1  Biases in Sympathy and Guilt
First, despite being early-emerging, reliable, and flexible, empathic responding does 
not necessarily work as an optimal moral guide. This is certainly true by school age, 
when children show more sympathy for peers of their gender than peers of the other 
gender (Feshbach & Roe, 1968) and for those in their “minimal” in-group (i.e., 
assigned arbitrarily by the experimenter) than their minimal out-group (Masten 
et al., 2010). Some evidence suggests that even infants can be selectively prosocial, 
such as by directing more help toward mothers than strangers (Davidov et al., 2020; 
Young et al., 1999). As such, empathic responding and the prosocial behavior it 
motivates is not foolproof and may even lead us astray from our presumed goal of 
transcending biases and behaving in more “rationally” prosocial ways (see Bloom, 
2016; Wynn et al., 2018).
Important and compelling as these considerations are, they do not, to our minds, 
detract from the account of empathic responding as a naturally selected and early-­
emerging mechanism to link an observer’s affective state with another person’s and 
thereby create a vested interest in the observer to act on the other’s behalf. Indeed, 
the biases evident in empathic responding are precisely the kinds of biases one 
would expect for an evolved system whose purpose is not to create impartial “moral” 
beings but rather beings who behave in ways that ultimately benefit themselves 
(and/or their genes). This is entirely consistent with the proposal that social forces 
and rationality may capitalize on – or even work against – this foundational affec-
tive mechanism in order to shape prosocial behaviors and decisions according to the 
moral values of the particular group or culture (Bloom, 2016).
With that in mind, we can use the evolutionary framework to propose further 
hypotheses about the forms that early sympathy and guilt should take. First, if these 
mechanisms evolved to motivate prosocial behaviors toward those with whom we 
are likely to be interdependent, then they should, from early on, be biased in favor 
of such individuals. As reviewed above, such biases do exist in school-age chil-
dren’s sympathy, but little research has examined whether this holds true among 
infants and toddlers. We do know that even within the first year, infants show a 
preference for familiar faces, the faces of those who belong to the race they encoun-
ter most often, and those who speak their native language rather than a foreign lan-
guage or with a foreign accent (Bar-Haim et al., 2006; Bushnell, 2001; Kinzler 
et al., 2010). Further, by 9 months of age, infants’ processing of important social 
cues such as faces, voices, emotions, and pupil size primarily occurs in the context 
of own-race faces, not other-race faces (Kelsey et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 2012). 
Given the importance of attending to, parsing, and processing social stimuli for 
empathic responding, we may predict that these early-emerging biases should result 
A. Vaish and T. Grossmann

361
in biased sympathy even in infancy and early toddlerhood. Yet beyond the few 
studies that suggest greater prosocial behavior toward mothers than strangers 
(Davidov et al., 2020; Young et al., 1999), researchers have not seriously examined 
biases in infants’ and toddlers’ sympathy.
This applies to young children’s guilt as well. If guilt has evolved, first and fore-
most, to repair our valuable relationships, then we may expect that from early in 
development children should feel more guilty after causing harm to - and should be 
more forgiving of - those who are like them or are in their group (see Vaish & 
Oostenbroek, in press). This will be an exciting direction for future work on early 
guilt and its reparative functions.
Equally, we can consider other, more complex functions of guilt beyond the 
repair of interpersonal, dyadic relationships. In particular, “collective guilt,” that is, 
guilt about the transgressions of close others such as in-group members, motivates 
individuals to accept responsibility and compensate for the negative actions of in-­
group members, thereby reducing intergroup conflict and regulating group life 
(Doosje et al., 1998; Lickel et al., 2004). Though it seems unlikely that guilt evolved 
primarily to serve this intergroup function, it is nonetheless possible that as humans 
became more group minded a couple of hundred thousand years ago (due to compe-
tition from other groups), natural selection exapted the existing interpersonal guilt 
to serve intergroup reparative functions as well. Yet the developmental foundations 
of collective guilt remain largely unexplored. In one recent study, 5-year-olds 
reported greater willingness to accept responsibility for harm caused by an in-group 
than an out-group member (Over et al., 2016). However, children did not attempt to 
repair the damage caused by the in-group more than the out-group member, leaving 
open whether children’s acceptance of collective responsibility translates into repar-
ative behavior. Moreover, no research has examined collective guilt in children 
younger than 5 years. This is an important direction for future work.
16.3.2  Other Prosocial Motives
A second important caveat is that although humans are clearly prepared from early 
on to care about and for others, we also simultaneously harbor self-serving motives 
(see Eisenberg et al., 2016). We are less likely to help others when it would mean a 
large cost to ourselves, and we may behave selfishly if we believe no one will find 
out, to name just a few examples. Moreover, in addition to acting prosocially out of 
a genuine concern for others’ welfare, we may also do so for selfish reasons, such as 
to enhance our reputations (Wedekind & Milinski, 2000). Recent work shows that 
reputational concerns motivate prosocial behavior as early as the preschool years, 
such that children act more prosocially when they are being watched – or are simply 
in the presence of an image of eyes – than when they are unobserved (Engelmann 
et al., 2012; Kelsey et al., 2018; Leimgruber et al., 2012). Moreover, as reviewed 
above, when they have caused someone harm, even 2-year-old children seem to 
want to be the ones to repair that harm, hinting that even toddlers may care about 
16  Caring for Others: The Early Emergence of Sympathy and Guilt

362
being recognized for their prosocial actions under some circumstances (Hepach, 
Vaish, et al., 2017a).
It is worth noting that these more self-centered motivations do not seem to be the 
primary drivers of prosocial behavior in the first 2–3 years (Hepach et al., 2016), 
and perhaps even later in development. More critically, however, the presence of 
self-serving prosocial motives does not preclude the possibility of genuine regard 
for others’ welfare; the two kinds of motives can coexist and even work in conjunc-
tion to promote prosociality. If we keep in mind that the “goal” of natural selection 
is to bring about behaviors of adaptive import, then it seems entirely reasonable to 
allow for multiple motivational forces that lead us to those adaptive behaviors (see 
Vaish & Tomasello, 2014).
Indeed, prosocial behavior can also be motivated by positive affective states. As 
reviewed above, acting prosocially increases happiness, even among very young 
children, and this happiness likely motivates further prosociality (Aknin et al., 2018; 
Hepach et al., 2017b). Beyond this, however, children recognize and respond posi-
tively to others’ prosocial behaviors. Infants in their first year already differentiate 
helpful from harmful characters and prefer to interact with helpful ones (Hamlin, 
2013; Krol & Grossmann, 2020), and toddlers and preschoolers selectively help 
prosocial over antisocial individuals (Dahl et al., 2013; Vaish et al., 2010).
Recent evidence also reveals the role of more complex positive emotions in moti-
vating prosocial behavior (Vaish & Hepach, 2020). Specifically, receiving help elic-
its a nascent sense of gratitude among young children, which motivates them to act 
prosocially – seen both in their reciprocity toward the individual who provided help 
and, strikingly, in their “paying it forward” to new individuals (Beeler-Duden & 
Vaish, 2020; Hepach et al., 2019; Vaish et al., 2018). We may also expect that, like 
displays of guilt, displays of gratitude might serve important social and cooperative 
functions. Specifically, gratitude displays are thought to indicate that one appreci-
ates the kindness and is likely to reciprocate, thus communicating one’s commit-
ment to the norms of reciprocity and to one’s relationships (Keltner et al., 2006; 
McCullough et  al., 2008). Gratitude displays should, thus, elicit affiliation and 
cooperation from benefactors and bystanders, perhaps even fairly early in develop-
ment. One recent study provides initial evidence for this proposal (Vaish & Savell, 
2018), but far more research is needed to fully understand the role of positive social 
emotions in early prosociality.
16.3.3  Uniquely Human?
Finally, we end with some speculative thoughts about the degree to which the emo-
tional mechanisms we have focused on here are unique to humans versus shared 
with other species, particularly our closest living primate relatives, the Great Apes. 
There is now a great deal of evidence that chimpanzees (and bonobos, to the extent 
they have been studied) are sensitive to others’ immediate needs and requests for 
help and respond by doing such things as supporting their allies, removing barriers 
A. Vaish and T. Grossmann

363
to provide conspecifics with access to food, providing conspecifics with tools that 
will help them fulfill their need, and so forth (e.g., de Waal & Suchak, 2010; 
Warneken et al., 2007; Yamamoto et al., 2012). Yet the motivations underlying their 
prosocial behavior remain contested  – and challenging to study experimentally. 
Still, the evidence we do have to date suggests that chimpanzees’ helping may not 
be motivated by a genuine concern for others’ welfare. Thus, chimpanzees (and the 
other Great Apes) do not help a conspecific more after they have seen the conspe-
cific being harmed (Liebal et al., 2014); this stands in contrast to toddlers, who show 
sympathy for and subsequently act more prosocially toward individuals who are 
harmed (Hepach et al., 2012b; Vaish et al., 2009). Further, whereas chimpanzees 
reliably help a conspecific by providing a tool that the conspecific is requesting, 
they do not help paternalistically. That is, if the tool being requested will not in fact 
fulfill the conspecific’s need, chimpanzees do not correct the request and hand the 
tool that would fulfill the need (Hepach et al., 2020). This is again in contrast to tod-
dlers and preschoolers, who consider what the other person needs rather than only 
what the other person is requesting (Hepach et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2016; Martin 
& Olson, 2013). Together, the existing evidence presents us with a picture in which 
prosocial behaviors are shared among humans and other Great Apes, but the under-
girding other-oriented affective motivators are unique to humans. This further 
underscores the importance of studying the affective processes focused on in this 
chapter in order to arrive at a better understanding of the proximate mechanisms that 
enable and promote human cooperation. Moreover, it hints at the possibility that 
during human evolution, interdependence among group members may have indeed 
served as the breeding ground for the emergence of these affective processes.
In conclusion, based on the empirical evidence reviewed here, we suggest that 
human prosocial behaviors are rooted in other-oriented affective processes – sym-
pathy and guilt – that emerge early in human ontogeny. These insights are based 
upon novel tasks that tap into infants’ and young children’s responses to others in 
need or distress, which have identified the affective predictors, motivators, and con-
sequences of various forms of early prosocial behavior. These advances have not 
only opened the door to fostering a more mechanistic understanding of cooperative 
tendencies in early development but are also beginning to change how we view 
infants’ and young children’s abilities to engage with and care about others. 
Specifically, in recent years, the field has come a long way toward dismantling the 
long-held view of infants as immature social beings simply infected by another 
person’s displays of need and distress. This view is being replaced by empirical 
evidence attesting to infants’ and young children’s competent navigation of their 
social environment and their genuine, affect-guided prosocial orientation toward 
social partners. Yet there is much to be learned about the early origins of human 
prosocial behavior and its affective bases. In our view, a promising path forward is 
to adopt an evolutionary perspective based on the interdependence hypothesis 
(Tomasello, 2016) and take an interdisciplinary approach combining psychophysi-
ological and behavioral methods with the aim of uncovering the foundational affec-
tive mechanisms of early cooperative behaviors.

Glossary
Adaptations (1)  in evolutionary theory, universal and reliably developing inherited 
features that arose as a result of natural selection and helped to solve some prob-
lem of survival. (Bjorklund and Hart, Chap. 1)
Adaptations (2)  evolutionary and ecological shifts in biology or behavior that arise 
as a result of natural selection (ultimately) and local ontogenetic and proximate 
processes that help to solve time and energetic problems of efficiency and sur-
vival. May or may not include intergenerational change. (Ivey Henry and Morell, 
Chap. 10)
Allocare  time or energetic investment in the protection and nurturing of infants by 
individuals other than mother. (Ivey Henry and Morell, Chap. 10)
Allomother  term used to refer to a female or male caretaker other than the mother. 
Note that when paternity is unknown, the term may be applied to the father.

eyes closed, fur or feathers absent, and with no ability to locomote on their own. 
(DeSilva, Chap. 4; Ivey Henry and Morell, Chap. 10)
Angelman syndrome  a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous 
system. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development,

excitable, interacting a great deal with caregivers. (Salmon and Hehman, Chap. 9)
Apoptosis  programmed cell death. (Wilder and Semendeferi, Chap. 3)
Ardipithecus  an early hominin genus from Eastern Africa known from fossils dis-
covered in 4.4–5.8 million-year-old sediments. (DeSilva, Chap. 4)
Attachment behavioral system  the system of evolved psychological and behav-
ioral mechanisms that promote proximity-seeking and relationship maintenance 
with attachment figures, promoting survival (Simpson and Jaeger, Chap. 11) that 

372
has been interpreted according to an evolutionary developmental psychology 
model of attachment as a mechanism that arose for advancing ancestral infants’ 
survival by promoting exclusive proximal contact specifically with mothers. 
(Hart, Chap. 7)
Attachment theory  a middle-level evolutionary theory that explains social and 
personality development in response to the significant environmental and inter-
personal experiences across life. (Simpson and Jaeger, Chap. 11)
Attachment-based caregiving  construct that refers to an evolutionary develop-
mental psychology model of a psychological mechanism for upholding maternal 
caregiving of weanlings that took over for biobehavioral features of lactation at 
the juncture when an ancestral mother transitioned from caring for a nursling to 
caring for a weanling. (Hart, Chap. 7)
Australopithecus  a Plio-Pleistocene hominin genus from Africa known from fos-
sils discovered in 4.2–1.0 million-year-old deposits and likely to be the ancestral

recurrent threats. (Rakison, Chap. 14) See also Recurrent threats.
Biocultural reproduction (BCR)  the human style of hyper-cooperation by allo-
parents in the extra-maternal production of food and other material and emo-
tional resources for the feeding and care of offspring. BCR is based on culturally 
defined rules for marriage and kinship and the obligations these entail toward 
cooperation in reproduction and care of offspring. (Locke and Bogin, Chap. 6)
Cephalopelvic index  the ratio between linear or area measurements of the neona-
tal skull and dimensions of the female pelvis. (DeSilva, Chap. 4)
Child-to-mother attachment  term that refers to an evolutionary developmental

to their mothers. It is theorized as a psychological mechanism, born of proximal 
contact anchored in 3 years of breastfeeding as practiced in ancestral settings. 
(Hart, Chap. 7)
Chord  multiple notes that are perceived to sound simultaneously. (Doi and 
Masataka, Chap. 9)
Collective intentionality  in Tomasello’s theory, the ability to establish a group-­
minded “we” with other people beginning around the age of 3. (Bjorklund and 
Hart, Chap. 1)
Cooperative breeding  refers to species in which alloparents in addition to parents 
help care for and provision offspring. (Hrdy and Burkart, Chap. 8; Ivey Henry 
and Morelli, Chap. 10) See also Cooperative reproduction.

373
Cooperative development  refers to reciprocal processes in development that are 
directly and indirectly influenced by the contributions of persons other than par-
ents that increase a child’s capacity to successfully adapt to their environment. 
This includes features that are directly influenced by allocaregivers, as well as 
community behaviors and norms that shape a child’s experience and future suc-
cess. Examples are social agency, reciprocity, and cultural competencies exhib-
ited by hunter-gatherer children. (Ivey Henry and Morelli, Chap. 10)
Cooperative reproduction  refers to the reproductive dependence of parents on the 
time and energetic contributions of others to successfully rear young. It repre-
sents diverse processes, including allocare, provisioning, teaching, and cultural 
contributions to child survivorship and successful future reproduction. (Ivey 
Henry and Morelli, Chap. 10) See also Cooperative breeding.

Endocast  internal cast of the cranium. (Wilder and Semendeferi, Chap. 3)
Environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA)  the physical and social envi-
ronments in which humans evolved. The EEA is not a single environment, but 
rather the amalgamation of all the times and places under which humans faced 
evolutionary pressures. (McDowell and Volk, Chap. 5; Simpson and Jaeger, 
Chap. 11)
Epigenetics  refers narrowly to changes in the expression of gene code as a result of

evolutionary relationship and how different developmental mechanisms affect 
species change. (Bjorklund, Chap. 2)
Evolutionary developmental psychology  the study of the genetic and ecological 
mechanisms that govern the development of social and cognitive competencies 
common to all human beings and the epigenetic (gene-environment interactions) 
processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions. (Bjorklund and 
Hart, Chap. 1)
Evolutionary level of explanation  refers to causal processes of trait selection over 
evolutionary time, that is, adaptive and phylogenetic changes across generations. 
(Ivey Henry and Morelli, Chap. 10)
False-belief understanding  the ability to track an individual’s representations 
of reality that, in the case of false beliefs, differ from the “objective” reality. 
For example, a toy might be in location A but the individual believes the toy is 
in location B. (Buttelmann, Chap. 13)
Fear  a core emotion that occurs for a perceived threat or in anticipation of such a 
threat, and triggers physiological and behavioral responses that, on average, were 
adaptive for our ancestors. (Rakison, Chap. 14)
Fetal microchimerism  occurs when a low number of fetal cells are transferred 
across the placental barrier during pregnancy and are found to persist in the

(Buttelmann, Chap. 13)
Guilt  an aversive, self-conscious, social emotion experienced, most fundamen-
tally, when one has harmed someone or violated a moral norm. Over develop-
ment, guilt can take on far more complex forms and be elicited in more complex 
ways; for example, anticipatory guilt, collective guilt, survivor guilt. (Vaish and 
Grossmann, Chap. 16)

and to enjoy the feeling of belonging. (Locke and Bogin, Chap. 6)
Infant mortality rate (IMR)  the probability of an infant dying before it is 366 days 
old, typically expressed as a percentage or as a number of deaths per hundred.

levels of anger and clingy behavior when distressed. (Simpson and Jaeger, 
Chap. 11)
Insecure-avoidant attachment  an infant attachment pattern characterized by high 
levels of self-reliance and behavioral autonomy when distressed. (Simpson and 
Jaeger, Chap. 11)
Intention understanding  the ability to track and understand others’ intentions. 
Intentions comprise both a goal (what the other is doing) and a means chosen to 
achieve that goal (how the other is doing it), along with the rational dimensions 
of this choice (why the other has chosen to do it in that particular way). This is 
not to be confused with an understanding of intentionality (i.e., understanding 
that something or someone is an intentional agent). (Buttelmann, Chap. 13)
Intentional agents  beings whose behaviors are based on what they know and what 
they want, and who act deliberately to achieve their goals. (Bjorklund and Hart, 
Chap. 1)
Interbirth interval (IBI)  term refers to the number of months between two sub-
sequent births. Child outcomes are often discussed in terms of preceding IBIs, 
which point to prenatal exposure to influences in utero, such as maternal ­nutrition, 
and subsequent IBIs, which implicate postnatal exposure to influences, such as 
infant nutrition. (Hart, Chaps. 7 and 15)

givers and relationship partners will respond based on prior relational experi-
ences. (Simpson and Jaeger, Chap. 11)

biobehavioral bond marked by cycles of bidirectional involvement that connect 
nurslings to their mothers much as they connect mothers to their nurslings. (Hart,

because much of this learning involves cues that identify the mother. Since the 
human infant is born into a state of extreme helplessness, and the mother sup-

various types of cells. (Wilder and Semendeferi, Chap. 3)
Prader–Willi syndrome  a genetic disorder caused by a loss of function of specific 
genes on chromosome 15. Symptoms in newborns include weak muscles, poor 
feeding, and slow development. Beginning in childhood, those affected become 
constantly hungry which can lead to obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. (Salmon and 
Hehman, Chap. 9)
Precocial  a term used to characterize animals born alert, with their eyes open, 
body covering (e.g., fur or feathers) present, and able to independently locomote. 
(DeSilva, Chap. 4)

ers, and a few other species. They are distinguished by having, in general, grasp-
ing hands and feet, forward-facing eyes, large brains relative to body size, slow 
rates of growth and development, and complex social life. The living non-human 
primates are each successful species in their own right and none is the ancestor of 
humans. However, study of the non-human primates can provide indications of 
earlier stages in the evolution of humans and the possible origin of some human 
behaviors. (Locke and Bogin, Chap. 6)
Prosocial behavior  behavior that benefits another individual or group of individu-
als; for example, helping, sharing, comforting. (Vaish and Grossmann, Chap. 16)
Proximate level of explanation  concerned with the immediate mechanisms that 
underpin a trait or behavior; what causes the trait or motivates the behavior in an 
individual. (Ivey Henry and Morell, Chap. 10; Vaish and Grossmann, Chap. 16)
Pupillometry  measure of the dilation of the eyes’ pupils, which indexes activity of 
the sympathetic branch of the autonomous nervous system and is indicative of 
experienced internal arousal (e.g., the arousal induced by listening to emotion-
ally charged stimuli) or mental effort. (Vaish and Grossmann, Chap. 16)
Pyramidal neuron  primary excitatory neuron of the prefrontal cortex. (Wilder and 
Semendeferi, Chap. 3)
Glossary

379

and sharing that experience. (Bjorklund and Hart, Chap. 1; Buttelmann, Chap. 13; 
Hart, Chap. 15)
Silver–Russel syndrome  a growth disorder characterized by slow growth before 
and after birth. Newborns with this condition have low birth weight and often fail 
to grow and gain weight at the expected rate, sometimes referred to as failure to 
thrive. (Salmon and Hehman, Chap. 9)
Social agency  a social process by which a child initiates or directs experience 
related to learning and development. (Ivey Henry and Morelli, Chap. 10)

force in human evolution and necessitated a large brain to handle the variety 
and complexity of human communities. (Bjorklund, Chap. 2; Locke and Bogin, 
Chap. 6)
Social referencing  an infant’s use of another person’s emotional cues to interpret 
an ambiguous or uncertain event. (Bjorklund and Hart, Chap. 1; Hart, Chap. 15)

of concern for the other. (Vaish and Grossmann, Chap. 16)
Synaptogenesis  formation of synapses. (Bjorklund, Chap. 2; Wilder and 
Semendeferi, Chap. 3)
Synchrony  biobehavioral and microsocial processes that attune individuals to 
each other’s rhythms and responses, and which facilitate and maintain social and 
emotional bonding. It implies mutual adaptations of physiology and behavior in 
relationships over time, increasing the efficiency of communication and provi-
sioning of needs. (Ivey Henry and Morelli, Chap. 10). See also Parent-infant 
synchronization.

ment, with environments that are less consistent being more unpredictable. 
(Simpson and Jaeger, Chap. 11)
