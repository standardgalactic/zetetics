Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
Kim Milton
The theory of quantum electrodynamics was born immediately following the for-
mulation of quantum mechanics. In 1927 Dirac put Maxwell’s classical theory
of electromagnetism together with Planck’s and Einstein’s ideas of quanta [1].
The following year he came up with his famous equation describing a relativis-
tic electron [2], and with that all the ingredients for a quantum ﬁeld theory of an
electron interacting with photons ( light quantum) were present. In two deci-
sive papers in 1929 Heisenberg and Pauli [3, 4] developed a consistent theory of
quantum electrodynamics. (For a detailed history of the development of quantum
electrodynamics, see [17]. For scientiﬁc biographies of Julian Seymour Schwinger
(1918–94) and Richard Feynman (1918–88), who solved the problems of QED,
see [18,19].)
Thus the equations governing quantum electrodynamics were formulated
throughout the 1930s, which followed from the following Lagrangian density:
L = −1
4F μνFμν −¯ψ

m + γ μ
1
i ∂μ −eAμ
	
ψ,
where Aμ is the four-vector potential describing the photon, in terms of which the
electromagnetic ﬁeld strength is constructed, Fμν = ∂μAν −∂νAμ, and ψ is the
electron ﬁeld, ¯ψ = ψ†γ 0. Here appear the 4 × 4 Dirac matrices, which satisfy
the anticommutation relation
{γ μ, γ ν} = −2gμν,
in the metric gμν = diag (−1, 1, 1, 1). In the canonical  quantization scheme, we
regard the ﬁelds as operator-valued, satisfying the canonical equal-time commuta-
tion relations in the radiation gauge where ∇· A = 0:
[A⊥i(x, t), E⊥j(y, t)] = −i

δij −∇i∇j
∇2

δ(x −y),
{ψ†
α(x, t), ψβ(y, t)} = δαβδ(x −y).
Here, Ei = F 0i, and ⊥denotes the transverse part, ∇· E⊥= 0, while α, β are
Dirac indices. The second relation is an anticommutation relation for the electron
ﬁeld, reﬂecting the fact that it is a Fermion.
However, when people tried to calculate using this theory, assuming an expansion
in the small parameter called the ﬁne structure constant, α = e2/4πℏc = 1/137, all
but the most trivial processes turned out to be divergent. There were some notable
successes during this period, perhaps most important being the Euler-Heisenberg

Lagrangian that describes exactly the quantum motion of an electron in a constant
background electromagnetic ﬁeld [5]. Among other processes, this represents the
scattering of light by light, a phenomenon not directly yet observed, although
present as an internal process in the well-tested theory of the anomalous magnetic
moment of the electron. This scattering process can be represented pictorially by
what we would now call a  Feynman diagram, see Fig. 1. Here the loop repre-
sents an electron, as a virtual particle, one that does not satisfy the ordinary balance
between energy and momentum,
E2 ̸= m2c4 + p2c2.
Thus, it can only propagate for a short distance and for a short period of time.
Oppenheimer and many others struggled with the theory of quantum electrody-
namics, but little progress was made until after the second world war, when using
techniques developed during the war experimentalists established that two predic-
tions of the Dirac theory of the electron were invalid. One was that the 2s1/2 and
2p1/2 states of the hydrogen atom should be degenerate, that is, have equal energy;
the nondegeneracy is called the Lamb shift, after it was conclusively established by
Willis Lamb [6]. The second turned out to be an deviation from the Dirac g-factor
of the electron, its anomalous magnetic moment, unexpectedly discovered by Nafe,
Nelson, and Rabi [7], and by Kusch and Foley [8]. This set the stage for solving the
theory, and in Schwinger’s words, showed that “electrodynamic effects were neither
inﬁnite nor zero, but ﬁnite and small, and demanded understanding.”
So after these results were announced at the Shelter Island conference in June
1947, theoretical developments rapidly followed. Based on discussions at the
meeting, Bethe published a nonrelativistic calculation of the Lamb Shift [9]. By De-
cember, Schwinger had a relativistic calculation of this effect (with some incorrect

details), and most importantly had calculated the anomalous magnetic moment of
the electron [10],
μ =
e
2mcgS,
where S is the spin operator for the electron, and the g-factor, to ﬁrst order in α, was
g
2 = 1 + α
2π.
The correction to the Dirac value gD = 2 was in perfect agreement with experi-
ment. A quantitative theory of quantum electrodynamics had been achieved. What
Schwinger had done in this famous 1-page paper was to isolate the inﬁnities that
occurred in the calculations into redeﬁnitions, or  renormalization, of the mass
and charge of the electron.
Feynman rapidly caught up, and based on the propagator methods he had begun
to develop in his Ph.D. thesis at Princeton, derived a pictorial method of calculating
processes in QED. Although initially meeting with disbelief, the method turned out
to be simpler than Schwinger’s earlier methods, and is now the universal formulation
of perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory: the famous Feynman diagrams [11,12]. Before
Feynman’s papers appeared, Dyson had established that the methods of Schwinger
and Feynman, although appearing so different, were actually mathematically equiv-
alent [13, 14], although Feynman had already demonstrated that equivalence to his
own satisfaction.
The Feynman rules for quantum electrodynamics are exhibited in Fig. 2. The
lines represent the particle propagators, and the vertices interactions. In addition,
for external on-shell lines one must supply an appropriate  wave function: for the
photon a polarization vector eμ
pλ, and for the electron, a spinor upσ or u∗
pσγ 0. Fur-
thermore, a factor of −1 must be supplied for each closed Fermion loop, reﬂecting
the statistics of Fermions. By putting these components together in all possible
ways, one arrives at the quantum-mechanical amplitude for a process. Thus, for
example, the  Feynman diagram that corresponds to the famous Schwinger cor-
rection to the magnetic moment of the electron is shown in Fig. 3. By using the

A calculation of a few pages yields the result for the g-factor of the electron:

Since 1949, progress in QED has been considerable. A great many processes
have been calculated, and agreement with experiment is spectacular. With the aid
of computers, even the O(α5) corrections to g −2 have been computed. Last
year [15, 16] a new precision experiment has yielded the most exquisite test of
quantum electrodynamics to date. Because the experiment is more accurate than
other measurements of the ﬁne structure constant α, it can be used to determine that
constant most precisely. The experiment is consistent with the statement that the
electron is a point particle down to an incredible distance of 6 × 10−24 m.
