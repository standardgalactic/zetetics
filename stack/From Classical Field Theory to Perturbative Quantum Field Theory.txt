Dedicated to the memory of Raymond Stora and Eberhard Zeidler.
Besides H. Epstein and V. Glaser, Raymond Stora is one of the fathers
of causal perturbation theory and he passionately worked on this topic
until the end of his life [10]. In innumerable discussions with Eberhard
Zeidler I learned a lot about the mathematical aspects of quantum ﬁeld
theory and the “unity of mathematics and physics”, and he strongly
encouraged me to write this book.

Foreword by Klaus Fredenhagen
Quantum ﬁeld theory is a framework for the description of physics which explains
a huge range of phenomena at quite diﬀerent scales. Its main feature is the way,
how inﬁnitely many degrees of freedom are coupled in agreement with the principle
of locality. Quantum ﬁeld theory was especially successful in elementary particle
physics, where the standard model yields a consistent picture, ranging from atomic
physics up to the highest presently reachable energies. Its principles are also very
fruitful for our understanding of condensed matter.
Quantum ﬁeld theory has classical physics and nonrelativistic quantum me-
chanics as limit cases. But contrary to them, the mathematical status of quantum
ﬁeld theory is not fully clariﬁed, and our conﬁdence on QFT relies on the consis-
tent picture, which evolves from diﬀerent approaches, and, mainly, on the good,
and in many instances excellent, agreement with experimental data.
Among the various approaches, formal perturbation theory is by far the most
successful one. Formal perturbation theory, however, provides only formal power
series as predictions. By resummation and truncation, numbers can be extracted
from these formal series, which then can be compared with observations. The latter
method is based on heuristic ideas and is, in general, not mathematically rigorous.
The computation of the terms of the formal power series is obstructed by
various divergences, which occur in a direct application of the perturbative expan-
sion. Here one can distinguish infrared (IR) divergences and ultraviolet (UV) di-
vergences. UV-divergences are a consequence of the locality principle, which forces
the inclusion of arbitrarily high energies in intermediate states. IR-divergences, on
the other hand, are due to wrong ad hoc assumptions on the long distance behavior
of interacting theories.
UV-divergences can be treated by the method of renormalization. This me-
thod was originally developed by Tomonaga, Schwinger, Feynman and Dyson,
but had internal inconsistencies which could later be removed by the work of
Bogoliubov, Parasiuk [11] and Hepp [98] (BPH). Important further steps were
performed by Zimmermann [176], Epstein and Glaser [66], and Steinmann [155].
With the generalization to gauge theories by Faddeev [69], ’t Hooft and Veltman
[106], Becchi, Rouet and Stora [7, 8], the perturbative construction of quantum
ﬁeld theory was essentially complete.

Foreword by Klaus Fredenhagen
A new interpretation of renormalization was developed by Wilson [171]. The
main idea is that the theory at a given scale can be evaluated without knowing
the theory at all scales. Thus introducing a UV-cutoﬀat a given scale yields a
reasonable eﬀective theory at this scale, provided the free parameters are given
the correct dependence on the cutoﬀ. In so-called renormalizable theories, the
running of the free parameters can be obtained from perturbation theory.
The Wilsonian approach was mainly used in terms of the euclidean (imagi-
nary time) path integral. But in this framework, important features of QFT are not
directly visible, in particular, the noncommutative structure of quantum observ-
ables shows up only in diﬀerent boundary values of analytically extended correla-
tion functions. Moreover, when the theory is applied to more general spacetimes
than the Minkowski space, in order to study eﬀects of an external gravitational
ﬁeld, one ﬁnds that there is no generally covariant deﬁnition of the (real time) path
integral, a diﬃculty arising from the non-existence of a generally covariant vacuum.
The correlation functions of the real time path integral are the vacuum ex-
pectation values of time-ordered products of interacting ﬁelds. According to the
famous Lehmann–Symanzik–Zimmermann [124] (LSZ) relations, they are closely
related to the S-matrix elements, as proven by Hepp [97] on the basis of the Haag–
Ruelle scattering theory [92, 145]. One may therefore restrict oneself to computing
these correlation functions. After splitting the action into a quadratic functional
and the rest (the interaction), one obtains an expansion in terms of the familiar
Feynman diagrams. They can be recursively computed by the method of BPH,
and a closed expression was given by Zimmermann [176] in terms of the so-called
Zimmermann-Forests.
In many cases, however, one is interested in other aspects of the theory. This
holds in particular in cases, where there is no reasonable particle interpretation,
e.g., on spacetimes without asymptotically ﬂat regions. As proposed by Bogoliubov
[12], one can deﬁne the interacting ﬁeld as an operator-valued distribution on the
Fock space of the free theory, provided one knows the time-ordered products of
the interaction as operators on Fock space.
This approach (later called “causal perturbation theory”) was rigorously
elaborated by Epstein and Glaser [66]. They characterized the time-ordered pro-
ducts by certain axioms and proved that solutions exist and are uniquely de-
termined, if the standard renormalization conditions are imposed. An essentially
equivalent approach was developed by Steinmann [155] based on the so-called re-
tarded products. Unfortunately, these extensions of the framework of perturbation
theory did not ﬁnd suﬃcient recognition (it is not even mentioned in most of the
recent text books on QFT), perhaps due to problems in extending it to gauge
theories and in relating it to the renormalization group in the spirit of Wilson.
Actually, the absence of a regularization scale in causal perturbation theory is in
apparent conﬂict with the Wilsonian interpretation of such a scale.
First steps for extending causal perturbation theory to gauge theory were
performed by Scharf, D¨utsch and collaborators [49, 148, 149]. In particular, these

authors were able to show that massive nonabelian gauge ﬁelds can be consistently
quantized, provided a real scalar ﬁeld was added. The latter can be identiﬁed with
the Higgs ﬁeld. A remarkable feature of this approach is the absence of spontaneous
breakdown of symmetry, which is crucial for the conventional formulation of the
standard model. The model is nevertheless equivalent to the standard model, up
to infrared problems which are open in both approaches.
Actually, this approach yields the deﬁnition of the S-matrix for gauge theories
in the absence of IR-divergences, i.e., if all arising physical particles have non-zero
masses. In the presence of massless particles (i.e., photons in the standard model)
the S-matrix (in the usual sense) does not exist, and one has to construct other
observables.
In the last two decades, a new eﬀort was made to improve perturbative
QFT, with the aim to construct the local observables for gauge theories and in the
presence of external gravitational ﬁelds. It turned out that this required certain
changes of the framework.
First of all, as previously observed by Dimock and Kay [34], one had to use
the algebraic approach to quantum ﬁeld theory [93] (also called Local Quantum
Physics [94]). In this approach one ﬁrst considers the algebra of local observables
as an abstract algebra. States are then deﬁned as linear functionals on the algebra
yielding the expectation values. By the GNS construction, each state yields a
representation of the algebra by operators on some Hilbert space. This approach
is especially useful in the absence of a distinguished state (the typical situation on
curved spacetimes) or, if the state space is a priori not well understood, as visible
in IR-divergences for wrong choices.
The second ingredient is the use of structures of the associated classical
ﬁeld theory. Actually, QFT may be interpreted as a deformation quantization
of classical ﬁeld theory, as suggested by the relation of the labeling of Feynman
diagrams by the number of loops and the expansion with respect to powers of ℏ.
The third ingredient is the choice of an appropriate framework of analysis
which replaces the techniques for Hilbert space operators. Here, starting from
the thesis of Radzikowski [140], the use of microlocal analysis turned out to be
appropriate.
Based on these ingredients a new formalism of perturbative quantum ﬁeld
theory was developed, mainly by Brunetti, D¨utsch, Fredenhagen, Hollands, Re-
jzner and Wald [24, 27, 48, 55, 74, 100, 101], and supported by advice from Stora
[138, 158]. The formalism includes older approaches and provides a more complete
solution. Nevertheless, it is less involved and allows explicit calculations. Moreover,
it is mathematically rigorous. Clearly it is now the right time to give a coherent
introduction to the ﬁeld in order to make it easier accessible for newcomers.
There exists already a brief description of the framework by Katarzyna Re-
jzner [143], addressed to mathematicians. The present book by Michael D¨utsch
takes a more pragmatic point of view and is directed to physicists. So not only the
general ideas are carefully developed, but many concrete calculations and other

xiv

applications are included. In particular, certain parts of the literature are elab-
orated in more detail; moreover, some inconsistencies in the original papers are
removed. While mathematically rigorous, an attempt is made to keep the used
mathematics rather elementary and within standard knowledge of physicists.
The book should be helpful for master and Ph.D. students who want to
understand QFT and want to become able to make concrete calculations, on the
basis of a consistent framework. Also the experienced researcher will proﬁt from
reading this nice book.

Preface
On the one hand, perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory (pQFT) is very successful:
The results obtained by computing the lowest orders of the perturbation series are
in good agreement with experiments. In particular, for the magnetic moment of
the electron the deviation of the g-factor from the Dirac value g = 2 is an eﬀect of
quantum electrodynamics (QED); the theoretical prediction and the experimental
value for (g −2) agree with a spectacular accuracy.
On the other hand, pQFT appears to be somewhat mystic or magic. This
relies not only on the fact that, for all known, physically relevant models in d = 4
dimensions, the convergence of the perturbation series is not under control; it relies
also on the way pQFT is “derived” in many textbooks: Some of the arguments are
only on a heuristic level; frequently rigorous treatments are hidden in the original
literature, not intelligible for a non-expert.
Therefore, the aim of this book is to give a logically satisfactory route from
the fundamental principles to the concrete applications of pQFT, which is well
intelligible for students in mathematical physics on the master or Ph.D. level.
This book is mainly written for the latter; it is made to be used as basis for an
introduction to pQFT in a graduate-level course.
Let me explain the advantages of this book more explicitly and sketch the
procedure. In conventional formulations of pQFT (see, e.g., [109, 134, 168]) one
usually constructs the scattering matrix (S-matrix) as a formal power series in
the coupling constant(s) κ. The coeﬃcients of this series are obtained by inte-
grating time-ordered products of the interaction over their spacetime arguments.
Since the classical limit ℏ→0 of time-ordered products diverges, the quantization
process is not very transparent in such an approach. In addition, many textbooks
“derive” the rules for computing the S-matrix (i.e., the Feynman rules and their
renormalization), by working at intermediate steps with ill-deﬁned quantities.
In this book we present a novel way to pQFT [54, 55, 64], which avoids these
drawbacks. The starting point is a perturbative formulation of classical ﬁeld theory
(clFT); quantization is then done by deformation quantization of the underlying
free theory and by the principle that we want to maintain as much as possible
from the classical structure. Similarly to Steinmann’s ﬁrst book [155], this proce-

Preface
dure yields a formulation of pQFT in terms of retarded products, which are the
coeﬃcients of the perturbative expansion (in κ) of the interacting ﬁelds.
The main diﬀerence from Steinmann’s work is that we work with local-
ized interactions, i.e., the coupling constant κ is multiplied with a test function
M ∋x →g(x) (here M denotes the Minkowski space) with compact support –
this is similar to the Bogoliubov–Shirkov–Epstein–Glaser approach to pQFT (also
called “causal perturbation theory”) [12, 24, 66, 148, 158]. This switching of the
interaction avoids infrared (IR) divergences; one ﬁrst solves the ultraviolet (UV)
problem, which is the problem of renormalization and amounts to the extension
of distributions to coinciding points. To compute expectation values in scatter-
ing states, one performs the adiabatic limit g(x) →1 ∀x ∈M in a later step; in
this limit one has to solve the IR-problem. However, as observed by Brunetti and
Fredenhagen, the algebraic properties of interacting ﬁelds can be studied with-
out really performing the adiabatic limit, i.e., without meeting IR-divergences,
by the so-called “algebraic adiabatic limit” ([24, 52]; see Sect. 3.7). In particular
the usual formulation of the renormalization group as a renormalization of the
coupling constants can be obtained in this way ([27, 55, 57, 102]; see Sect. 3.8).
After translation of our retarded products into time-ordered products by
Bogoliubov’s formula ([12], see Sect. 3.3) the results agree with what one obtains
in causal perturbation theory [66]. Finally, performing the adiabatic limit g(x) →1
for these time-ordered products, one obtains the same experimental predictions –
mostly these are scattering experiments – as one ﬁnds in conventional textbooks
on pQFT.
In our approach, Fock space is replaced by a description of (classical and
quantum) ﬁelds as functionals on the classical conﬁguration space; in case of a
real scalar ﬁeld the conﬁguration space is C∞(M, R). Hence, technicalities of Fock
space, such as domains of operators, do not appear, at the price of having to
worry about wave front sets of distributions. However, a superﬁcial knowledge
of wave front sets, as given in App. A.3, suﬃces for an understanding of this
book. In contrast to the description of quantum ﬁelds as Fock space operators,
our (quantum) ﬁelds are “oﬀ-shell” ﬁelds, that is, they are not restricted by any
ﬁeld equation. This is a main reason why our description of quantum ﬁelds is more
ﬂexible, which is advantageous for various purposes: In particular for a discussion
of the classical limit and for a regularization of the Feynman propagator and the
deﬁnition of the pertinent regularized S-matrix (Sect. 3.9). Also more technical
issues are strongly simpliﬁed, e.g., the formulation of the Action Ward Identity
(Sect. 3.1.1) and the proof of the Main Theorem (Sect. 3.6.2), which is the key
to the St¨uckelberg–Petermann renormalization group (Sect. 3.6). Finally, our oﬀ-
shell ﬁeld formalism bears a close resemblance to the functional integral approach
to QFT, since also there one works with ﬁeld conﬁgurations being not restricted
by any ﬁeld equation – see Sect. 3.9.5.
Proceeding in the spirit of this book’s title, we treat symmetries by means
of the Master Ward Identity (MWI, Chap. 4). Namely, the MWI is the straight-

Preface
xvii
forward generalization to pQFT of the most general identity valid in clFT due to
the ﬁeld equation and the fact that classical ﬁelds may be multiplied pointwise.
Since the latter does not hold for quantum ﬁelds, the MWI is a highly nontrivial
renormalization condition, which cannot always be satisﬁed.
To study a physically relevant model, we apply our formalism to QED, which
requires a treatment of gauge or BRST symmetry (Chap. 5). The main problems
appearing in the quantization of a gauge theory can be explained more clearly for
QED than for the Standard Model of electroweak and strong interactions, since
the latter is more complicated and has the additional diﬃculty that some of the
spin-1 ﬁelds (also called “vector boson ﬁelds”) are massive. For a treatment of
massive spin-1 ﬁelds in the Epstein–Glaser framework we refer to the book [149]
(or the enlarged edition [150]) or to the original papers [2, 49], for subsequent
developments see [50, 59, 65]. In view of the generalization to massless non-Abelian
gauge theories (in particular quantum chromodynamics) and to QFT on curved
spacetimes, we give a local construction of the observables of QED – this seems to
be the best one can do in a perturbative approach to such models (see Sect. 5.6).
The main subject of this book is pQFT and not classical ﬁeld theory. There-
fore, Chapters 1 and 2 about “Classical ﬁeld theory” and “Deformation quantiza-
tion of the free theory”, respectively, are quite short; essentially only the material
needed for the step from perturbative clFT to pQFT is presented. For example,
we restrict the treatment of classical ﬁeld theory to local interactions and the Pois-
son bracket is introduced only for the free theory – not for an interacting theory.
An exception is that we include in Chapter 2 the possibility of quantizing with a
Hadamard function instead of the Wightman two-point function – although the
treatment of pQFT in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 is based on quantization with the Wight-
man two-point function. The modiﬁcations appearing in pQFT when quantizing
with a Hadamard function are given in App. A.4.
The focus of this book is on the physical concepts – the mathematical tools
are reduced to a minimum. For this reason, we consider only ﬁelds which are poly-
nomials in the basic ﬁelds. The generalization of our formalism to non-polynomial
ﬁelds is worked out in the literature (see Remark 1.3.8), but this requires more
sophisticated mathematics, which is explained, e.g., in [143]. A reader more in-
terested in the mathematical aspects of QFT is referred to the books [173–175]
and [79].
The formalism developed in this book can be used to derive many structural
results of pQFT in a transparent way, e.g., the “Main Theorem” and the pertinent
version of the renormalization group (Sect. 3.6) or the “Quantum Action Principle”
(Sect. 4.3). On the other hand, this formalism is also well suited for practical
computations, as is explained in Sect. 3.5 (“Techniques to renormalize in practice”)
and by many examples and exercises.
Some proofs are only sketched – the complete versions can be found in the
original literature. Some other proofs, which are helpful to make an important
topic, such as the “Main Theorem”, more intelligible for a non-expert reader, are

xviii
Preface
given in greater detail than in the literature. Some statements can certainly be
formulated in a shorter, more elegant way; however, since this book is written for
non-experts, we prefer to give detailed and explicit formulas, to avoid misunder-
standings. Some exercises are quite simple – the expert reader may skip them.
However, the results of many exercises are used later on. Solutions are given for
all exercises.
For the expert reader the scope of this book can be summarized as follows:
• Our approach to QFT is formal perturbation theory: The observables are con-
structed as formal power series in the coupling constant and in ℏ. Questions
concerning the convergence of this series (or rather asymptotic convergence
or Borel summability) are not touched.
• Quantization is done by deformation of classical ﬁeld algebras. Since a direct
quantization of the algebra of perturbative, interacting, classical ﬁelds is not
yet solved, we apply deformation quantization to the underlying algebra of
free ﬁelds.
• Deformation quantization [6] of the free theory is worked out not only for
scalar ﬁelds (Chap. 2), also spinor ﬁelds, the photon ﬁeld and Faddeev–Popov
ghosts are treated (Sect. 5.1).
• Renormalization is done by a version of the Epstein–Glaser method [66]. So,
to a large extent, the subject of this book is causal perturbation theory for
oﬀ-shell ﬁelds, which has various advantages – as mentioned above.
• This book yields a perturbative construction of the net of algebras of ob-
servables (“perturbative algebraic QFT”, Sect. 3.7), this net satisﬁes the
Haag–Kastler axioms [93] of algebraic QFT, expect that there is no suitable
norm available on these formal power series. For this construction it suﬃces
to perform the algebraic adiabatic limit, which avoids IR-divergences. A main
motivation for this construction is that it can be generalized to curved space-
times [24, 100–103, 105]. However, in this book we remain in the Minkowski
space.
• Such a local algebraic construction of pQFT is explicitly worked out for QED
(Chap. 5): The observables are selected by means of the BRST transformation
[7, 8, 164]. A construction of the pre-Hilbert space of physical states is given
by a local version of the Kugo–Ojima formalism [118].
• To investigate the solvability of the Master Ward Identity (shortly introduced
above), we prove a version of the Quantum Action Principle (QAP, Theorem
4.3.1). The main diﬀerence of our results to the original QAP of Lowenstein
[125] and Lam [119] and its applications in “algebraic renormalization” (see,
e.g., [135]) is that we work with an adiabatically switched oﬀinteraction
(Sect. 4.5).
• The latter holds generally true: To make contact to traditional formulations
of pQFT, we have to perform the adiabatic limit. For algebraic properties

of the theory, e.g., the renormalization group, the algebraic adiabatic limit
suﬃces (Sect. 3.8). But, to compute expectation values in scattering states,
or Wightman- or Green’s functions, we have to perform the weak adiabatic
limit (in the sense of Epstein–Glaser). We treat the latter only brieﬂy, mainly
under the simplifying assumption that all ﬁelds are massive (App. A.6).

Introduction
Free quantum ﬁelds are well understood, but for all physically relevant models,
interacting quantum ﬁeld can only approximately be described. In this book, the
approximation is perturbation theory: The interacting quantum ﬁelds are con-
structed as a “deformation” of the free ones. In addition, we quantize by the
method of deformation quantization. Hence, the general scheme is as follows. There
are two deformations, in the sense that a “ﬁeld”1
F
is deformed into a formal power series
∞

n=0
Fn λn
with
F0 = F,
where the Fn’s are also “ﬁelds” and λ ∈R is the “deformation parameter”.
• One deformation, with parameter ℏ(the Planck constant), is the quantization
of the algebra of free classical ﬁelds (ℏ= 0), yielding the algebra of free
quantum ﬁelds (ℏ> 0).
• The other deformation, with parameter κ (a coupling constant), is the de-
formation of an algebra of free ﬁelds (κ = 0) into the corresponding algebra
of interacting ﬁelds (κ ̸= 0), which applies to both the classical and the
quantum theory.
Diagrammatically this can be described as follows:

acting classical ﬁelds, is not yet solved; for recent progress in this direction, see

Introduction
[74, 95]. So, heuristically speaking, we quantize the perturbative interacting clas-
sical ﬁelds by an indirect route:
FCF
FQF
PICF
PIQF
ℏ
κ
That is to say, our method is to quantize the underlying algebra of free ﬁelds.
Before we start to develop our formalism, we draw the reader’s attention to
App. A.1, in which some basic notations and conventions and a few mathematical
preliminaries are given.
Physical units. We use the “Planck system of units”; for a detailed explanation
of this system we refer to [173, App. A3]. We recall from this reference: “The
Planck system is characterized by the fact that all the physical quantities are
dimensionless and their numerical values coincide with the numerical values in
natural SI units.” In particular both c (the speed of light) and Planck’s constant
are equal to 1. Hence, we only write ℏ, when it has the meaning of a deformation
parameter (as above); then ℏ∈[0, ∞) is a switched value of Planck’s constant,
the physical value is ℏ= 1.

1.1
Conﬁguration space and the basic ﬁeld ϕ
To keep the formulas as simple as possible, we consider only one basic ﬁeld, which
is a real scalar ﬁeld on the d-dimensional Minkowski space Md ≡M; we assume
d > 2. The pertinent free ﬁeld may be massless, i.e., we allow m ≥0. The gen-
eralization to more than one basic ﬁeld and to more complicated ﬁelds is treated
in some examples and exercises and in particular it is worked out for quantum
electrodynamics in Chap. 5. The spacetime coordinates are x = (xμ) ∈M.
Most physicists understand by a classical ﬁeld a solution of a given ﬁeld
equation. We use a diﬀerent deﬁnition: Our “ﬁelds” are deﬁned without reference
to any ﬁeld equation. Our deﬁnition of “conﬁguration space” and “ﬁelds” (or
“observables”) in classical ﬁeld theory (clFT) is motivated by analogy to classical
mechanics.
Classical, non-relativistic mechanics (one point particle). The conﬁgurations are
the trajectories
⃗h :

R −→Rd−1
t −→⃗h(t) ,
where ⃗h(t) is the position of the particle at time t. Assuming smoothness of the
trajectories, the conﬁguration space is C∞(R, Rd−1). The basic observable ˆ⃗x(t) –
the position at time t – is the evaluation functional on the conﬁguration space:
ˆ⃗x(t) :

C∞(R, Rd−1) −→Rd−1

A simple example for a non-linear functional is the kinetic energy at time t:

with
fk1,k2(t1, t2) := m
2 δk1,k2 δ′(t1 −t) δ′(t2 −t) .
Generally, an observable is a function F of the map ˆ⃗x : R ∋t −→ˆ⃗x(t); F(ˆ⃗x) is an
R-valued functional on the conﬁguration space:
F(ˆ⃗x) :

C∞(R, Rd−1) −→R
⃗h −→F(ˆ⃗x)(⃗h) := F(⃗h) ,
that is, the number F(ˆ⃗x)(⃗h) is obtained by substituting ⃗h for ˆ⃗x in the formula for
F(ˆ⃗x). For example, the above formulas for Ekin(t) can be understood in this way.
If we restrict F to be a polynomial in ˆ⃗x, it is of the form
F(ˆ⃗x) = f0 +

The latter ensures existence of the integral in (1.1.1), when hkj ∈C∞(R, R) is
substituted for ˆxkj for all j = 1, . . . , n.
Note: In contrast to Ekin(t), the functionals (1.1.1) may be non-local in time,
that is, the support of f n
k1...kn does not need not to lie on the total diagonal
{(t1, . . . , tn) ∈Rn | t1 = · · · = tn}. Hence, values of ⃗h (and its derivatives) at
diﬀerent times may may be combined.
Classical ﬁeld theory. Here, the conﬁguration space is the space C := C∞(M, R)
of smooth functions. Since we are studying a model built from a real scalar ﬁeld,

we may use the word “ﬁeld” instead of “observable”. The basic ﬁeld ϕ is simply
the evaluation functional on the conﬁguration space, explicitly:
ϕ : M ∋x −→ϕ(x)
where
ϕ(x) :

C −→R
h −→h(x) .
(1.1.2)
Partial derivatives ∂aϕ are deﬁned by
∂aϕ(x) :

C −→R
h −→∂ah(x) ,
(1.1.3)
where a ∈Nd, see (A.1.23). A general ﬁeld is a function F of the map ϕ (1.1.2);
F(ϕ) is a functional on C:
F(ϕ) :

C −→C
h −→F(ϕ)(h) := F(h) .
(1.1.4)
We point out that F(ϕ) is C-valued – for the following purpose: In view of QFT,
we want to introduce a nontrivial “∗-operation” by complex conjugation – see
(1.2.7) below.
The ﬁrst question to be asked is: Which functionals F(ϕ) are allowed? Before
answering this (in Def. 1.2.1 below), we study two simple examples.
Example 1.1.1. Let x1, x2 ∈M and a, b ∈Nd be given. The product of ﬁeld derivatives
F1(ϕ) := ∂aϕ(x1) ∂bϕ(x2) : h −→F1(ϕ)(h) = ∂ah(x1) ∂bh(x2)
is well deﬁned – even for x1 = x2, but F1 is a non-linear functional of h.
The latter holds also for powers ϕn integrated out with g ∈D(M, C), where n ∈N:
F2(ϕ) :=

dx ϕn(x) g(x) : h −→F2(ϕ)(h) =

h(x)
n g(x) .
In Sects. 1.2–1.4 we introduce the mathematical framework for our formu-
lation of (perturbative) classical ﬁeld theory, which will be used also in pQFT.
Physics starts in Sect. 1.5: There we introduce the free action and interactions –
with that the relation of our notion of a “classical ﬁeld” to a “solution of a given
ﬁeld equation” will be clariﬁed.
1.2
The space of ﬁelds F
In this section we introduce the space of ﬁelds F, which will be used throughout
the whole book – also in QFT. In particular in view of deformation quantization,
it is a main advantage of our approach that the ﬁelds of both the classical and the
quantum theory are deﬁned in terms of the same space of functionals. Classical

and quantum ﬁelds diﬀer only by the algebraic structures that we will introduce on
this space: Main building blocks are the Poisson bracket for the classical algebra
and the (non-commutative) star product for the quantum algebra.
A main point is that our ﬁelds are “oﬀ-shell ﬁelds”, that is, they are not
restricted by any ﬁeld equation. For simplicity, we study only ﬁelds which are
polynomials in the basic ﬁeld ϕ (and its derivatives). Motivated by (1.1.1) we
deﬁne:
Deﬁnition 1.2.1 (Set of ﬁelds). The set of ﬁelds F is deﬁned as the totality of
functionals F ≡F(ϕ): C −→C of the form
F(ϕ) = f0 +

⟨fn, ϕ⊗n⟩
(1.2.1)
with N < ∞; the number F(ϕ)(h) is obtained by substituting h for ϕ in this
formula, according to (1.1.4). Here f0 ∈C is constant; but for n ≥1, each expres-
sion fn is a C-valued distribution (i.e., fn ∈D′(Mn, C)) with compact support,
which is
(i) symmetric in its arguments: fn(xπ(1), . . . , xπ(n)) = fn(x1, . . . , xn) for π ∈Sn;
and
(ii) whose wave front set satisﬁes the following property:
WF(fn) ⊆{ (x1, . . . , xn; k1, . . . , kn)


 (k1, . . . , kn) /∈V

−
} , (1.2.2)
where (A.1.11) is used.
The set of distributions fn of this kind will be denoted by F ′(Mn).
The condition that the distributions fn have compact support implies con-
vergence of the integral (1.2.1); hence, it is not needed that the conﬁgurations
h ∈C have any decay property.
The condition (i) is not necessary, however it avoids some redundancy of
the set of allowed fn’s (because ϕ(x1) · · · ϕ(xn) is symmetric in x1, . . . , xn) and it
simpliﬁes the expression for the functional derivatives given in (1.3.1).
A short introduction to wave front sets is given in App. A.3. The wave front
set of a distribution is a characterization of its singularities by means of the Fourier
transformation; the variables k1, . . . , kn ∈M appearing in (1.2.2) are the conjugate
momenta of the spacetime variables x1, . . . , xn ∈M. The purpose of the wave front
set condition (ii) is to ensure the existence of pointwise products of distributions
which appear in our deﬁnition of the Poisson bracket and, more generally, of the
star product (see Sects. 1.8 and 2; both deﬁnitions will be given for the free theory).

One easily checks that F ′(Mn) is a vector space, hence, this holds also for F:
For F = 
n⟨fn, ϕ⊗n⟩, G = 
n⟨gn, ϕ⊗n⟩∈F and α ∈C, the linear combination
F + αG =

n
⟨(fn + αgn), ϕ⊗n⟩: h −→F(h) + α G(h)
is also an element of F.
Convergence in F is understood in the pointwise sense: For Fn, F ∈F we
deﬁne
lim
n→∞Fn = F

lim
n→∞Fn(h) = F(h)
∀h ∈C .
(1.2.3)
Example 1.2.2. A constant functional is F = f0 ∈C, i.e., F(h) = f0 for any h.
Example 1.2.3. If Sn denotes symmetrization in x1, . . . , xn, we may consider
fn(x1, . . . , xn) := Sn

dx g(x)∂a1δ(x1 −x) · · · ∂anδ(xn −x) ,
g ∈D(M, C) , (1.2.4)
taking fk = 0 for k ̸= n. Then
F(ϕ) = (−1)

j |aj|

dx g(x) ∂a1ϕ(x) · · · ∂anϕ(x)
in this case. That fn (1.2.4) fulﬁlls the wave front set condition (1.2.2) can be seen on
general grounds, as explained after Remk. 1.2.6, or explicitly by a generalization of the
argumentation given in the next example.
Example 1.2.4. In particular, the preceding example states that

dx g(x) ϕn(x) ∈F for
g ∈D(M). However, we point out that ϕn(x) ̸∈F; for the following reason: Writ-
ing ϕn(x) in the form (1.2.1) the pertinent fn(x1, . . . , xn) = δ(x1 −x) · · · δ(xn −x)
is a symmetric, x-dependent distribution with compact support, but it violates the
wave front set condition (1.2.2). Namely, for h ∈D(Mn) , h(x, . . . , x) ̸= 0 we obtain

hfn(k1, . . . , kn) ∼

dx1 . . . dxn h(x1, . . . , xn) δ(x1 −x) · · · δ(xn −x) ei(k1x1+···+knxn) =
h(x, . . . , x) ei(k1+···+kn)x, which does not decay rapidly in any direction (k1, . . . , kn).
In contrast, for

dx g(x) ϕn(x) we obtain 
hfn(k1, . . . , kn) ∼l(k1 + · · · + kn) where
l(x) := g(x)h(x, . . . , x). Since l ∈D(M) ⊂S(M), we know that l ∈S(M). Therefore,
l(k1 + · · · + kn) decays rapidly for (k1, . . . , kn) ∈V

, that is, the wave front set

where k, g ∈D(M) and p is the retarded propagator (see Deﬁnition 1.8.1) – for this
example we only need that p ∈D′(M). This functional is of the form (1.2.1) with fn =

which we call the “∗-operation”. Obvious properties are
F ∗(h) = F(h)
∀h ∈C
and
(F + α G)∗= F ∗+ α G∗,
(F · G)∗= F ∗· G∗,
(F ∗)∗= F .
(1.2.8)
One can check that fn⊗symgk and fn also satisfy the wave front set condition
(1.2.2), hence FG and F ∗lie also in F, so that the vector space of ﬁelds F becomes
a commutative ∗-algebra (see App. A.1 for the deﬁnition of this notion). Moreover,
this algebra is unital; the unit is the constant functional F = 1, that is, 1(h) =
1 ∀h ∈C.
Remark 1.2.6. The wave front set condition (1.2.2) is a weak version of translation
invariance. Indeed, note that the latter property means that fn depends only on
the relative coordinates,
fn(x1, . . . , xn) = ˜fn(x1 −xn, . . . , xn−1 −xn),
which has the following consequences:
=⇒supp fn ⊆{ (k1, . . . , kn)


 k1 + · · · + kn = 0 }
=⇒WF(fn) ⊆Mn × { (k1, . . . , kn)


 k1 + · · · + kn = 0 }
(1.2.9)
=⇒WF(fn) ∩

Mn × (V


= ∅.
A stronger form of the wave front set condition (1.2.2) would be to ask that
each WF(fn) satisfy (1.2.9), i.e., that k1 + · · · + kn = 0 for all

x, (k1, . . . , kn)

∈
WF(fn) – this condition is used, e.g., in [54, 57], see also Remk. 1.3.6. However
this stronger version does not work on a curved spacetime, since there the vectors
k1, . . . , kn belong in general to diﬀerent cotangent spaces, and hence cannot be
added.

1.3.
Derivatives and support of functionals, local ﬁelds

With this remark, the wave front set condition for Exap. 1.2.3 can be veriﬁed
also in the following way: Let
˜fn(x1, . . . , xn) := Sn
	
dx ∂a1δ(x1 −x) · · · ∂anδ(xn −x) .
Comparing the singularities of fn and ˜fn, we see that the test function g appearing
in fn suppresses some singularities of ˜fn, hence WF(fn) ⊂WF( ˜fn). Since ˜fn is
translation invariant, its wave front set fulﬁlls (1.2.9). Therefore, the ﬁeld F(ϕ)
studied in Exer. 1.2.3, is an element of F.
1.3
Derivatives and support of functionals, local ﬁelds
The notions mentioned in the title of this section are frequently used in the tra-
ditional literature. Our point is that, by using the special form (1.2.1) of the
functionals F ∈F, we can give simpler or more explicit deﬁnitions of these no-
tions.
Functional derivative. We deﬁne directly the kth-order derivative for k ∈N∗.
Deﬁnition 1.3.1. The kth-order functional derivative of a ﬁeld F (given by (1.2.1))
with respect to the basic ﬁelds ϕ(yj) is deﬁned by
δkF
δϕ(y1) · · · δϕ(yk)
(1.3.1)
:=
N

n=k
n!
(n −k)!
	
dx1 · · · dxn−k ϕ(x1) · · · ϕ(xn−k) fn(y1, . . . , yk, x1, . . . , xn−k) .
From the properties of the fn, it follows that for all h ∈C, the functional
derivative applied to h is a distribution,
δkF
δϕ(y1)···δϕ(yk)(h) ∈D′(Mk, C), which has
compact support and is symmetric in its arguments; the latter property can be
written without application to h:
δkF
δϕ(yπ(1)) · · · δϕ(yπ(k)) =
δkF
δϕ(y1) · · · δϕ(yk)
∀π ∈Sk .
The deﬁnition (1.3.1) uses the symmetry of fn in its arguments: Due to this
property it agrees with the usual deﬁnition of the functional derivative, e.g.,
	
dy1dy2
δ2F
δϕ(y1)δϕ(y2)(h) g(y1)g(y2) = d2

Let a map β : F⊗n −→F be given. Since DkF :=
δkF
δϕ···δϕ (1.3.1) is an F-
valued distribution – we write DkF ∈D′(Mk, F) for that – the map β is well
deﬁned also on Dk1F1 ⊗· · · ⊗DknFn by
⟨β(Dk1F1 ⊗· · · ⊗DknFn) , g1 ⊗· · · ⊗gn⟩

Example 1.3.2 (Complex scalar ﬁeld). A complex scalar ﬁeld φ(x) and its ∗-conjugate
ﬁeld φ∗(x) are the evaluation functionals
φ(x), φ∗(x) :

C∞(M, C) −→C
φ(x)(h) := h(x) ,
φ∗(x)(h) := h(x) ,

n,l(Mn) is deﬁned analo-
gously to F ′(Mn) (Deﬁnition 1.2.1); the only diﬀerence is that “symmetry” is meant only
with respect to permutations of the form (1, . . . , n) −→(π(1), . . . π(l), σ(l + 1), . . . , σ(n))

1.3.
Derivatives and support of functionals, local ﬁelds
11
We emphasize that φ(x) and φ∗(x) behave as independent ﬁelds – this can be under-
stood as the independence of Re φ(x) and Im φ(x) and becomes particularly clear in the
deﬁnition of the functional derivative:
δk+jF
δφ∗(y1) · · · δφ∗(yk)δφ(z1) · · · δφ(zj) :=
N

n=k+j
n−j

· fn,l(y1, . . . , yk, x1, . . . , xl−k, z1, . . . , zj, xl−k+1, . . . , xn−k−j) .
(1.3.7)
So, for the functional derivative with respect to φ, the ﬁeld φ∗behaves as a constant;
and the same for φ ↔φ∗.
Support of a functional. We use the functional derivative to deﬁne the support of
a functional.
Deﬁnition 1.3.3. The support of F ∈F is deﬁned as
supp F := supp δF
δϕ(·) ≡

h∈C
supp δF
δϕ(·)(h) ;
on the r.h.s. we mean the support in the sense of distributions (see App. A.1).
That is, supp F is the complement of the largest open subset of M on which all
distributions { δF
δϕ(·)(h) ∈D′(M, C)


 h ∈C} vanish.
Hence F(0) = f0 is irrelevant for the support of F = N
n=0⟨fn, ϕ⊗n⟩. The
support supp F is given by the supports of the various fn in the following way:
supp F =
N

n=1
Un
where
Un := { y ∈M


 ∃(x1, . . . , xn−1) ∈Mn−1 such that (y, x1, . . . , xn−1) ∈supp fn }.
Since, for each fn, the support supp fn is bounded, all the sets Un are bounded
and, therefore, supp F is bounded. This is what is meant by saying that all ﬁelds
F ∈F are “localized”.
From the Leibniz rule (1.3.4) we conclude that
supp(F · G) ⊆(supp F ∪supp G)
∀F, G ∈F .
We point out that the stronger relation supp(f · g) ⊆(supp f ∩supp g), valid
for functions f, g : M −→C, does not hold for functionals F, G ∈F; a simple
counter example is given for F = c ∈C with c ̸= 0 and supp G ̸= ∅, namely:
supp(c G) = supp G ̸= ∅= (supp F ∩supp G).

Chapter 1.
Classical Field Theory
Local ﬁelds. In clFT and QFT one mostly assumes that the interaction is local –
our formulation of perturbative clFT and pQFT will use this assumption. To treat
local interactions we introduce the space Floc of local ﬁelds, which is a subspace of
F. Local ﬁelds are linear combinations of ﬁelds of the form treated in Exap. 1.2.3.
More explicitly we deﬁne:
Deﬁnition 1.3.4. The vector space Floc of local ﬁelds is deﬁned as follows: Let P
be the space of polynomials in the variables {∂aϕ | a ∈Nd} with real coeﬃcients
(“ﬁeld polynomials”); then
Floc :=

In the following exercise we derive some basic properties of local ﬁelds.
Exercise 1.3.5. Let A(g) ∈Floc. By
∂A
∂(∂μ1 ···∂μl ϕ) we mean the partial derivative of the
polynomial A ≡A(ϕ, ∂μϕ, . . . , ∂μ1 · · · ∂μsϕ) with respect to the variable (∂μ1 · · · ∂μlϕ).

(1.3.12)

This yields the assertion (1.3.11). The latter implies immediately supp A(g) ⊆supp g.
A simple example for supp A(g) ̸= supp g is A(g) =

dx g(x)∂μϕ(x) with g|U = 1
for some open set U ̸= ∅; namely, for this A(g) we get
δA(g)
δϕ(y) = −∂μg(y) and, hence,
supp A(g) = supp ∂μg ̸= supp g.
The statement about the second derivative follows from (1.3.1) and (1.2.4).]
From this exercise we know the following: For F ∈Floc, the functional deriva-
tive
δF
δϕ(y) is an Floc-valued distribution; and, in particular from (1.3.12), that any
F ∈Floc automatically satisﬁes
supp(δ2F/δϕ2) ⊆Δ2 ,
(1.3.13)
where we mean the support in the sense of distributions and Δn is the thin diagonal
in Mn (A.1.12) – the property (1.3.13) is signiﬁcant for locality.
Remark 1.3.6 (Characterization of locality). For F = 
n⟨fn, ϕ⊗n⟩∈F, the con-
dition (1.3.13) is only necessary but not suﬃcient for locality of F (1.3.8); this
corrects an oversight in [55]. As explained below, the property (1.3.13) suﬃces to
prove that each fn is a linear combination of terms of the form (1.2.4) where the
“coeﬃcient” g is replaced by a distribution with compact support; but (1.3.13)
does not imply that these coeﬃcients are smooth.
However, if we deﬁne the space of ﬁelds F (Def. 1.2.1) by using the stronger
version of the wave front set condition (1.2.2) mentioned after (1.2.9), that is,
WF(fn) ⊆{ (x1, . . . , xn; k1, . . . , kn)


j=1
kj = 0 }
∀n ≥1
(1.3.14)
(in particular WF(f1) = ∅) instead of (1.2.2), then (1.3.13) is also suﬃcient for
locality (1.3.8). To prove this statement we proceed in three steps, cf. [29].
(1) If F = N
n=0⟨fn, ϕ⊗n⟩fulﬁlls (1.3.13), then it holds that
supp fn ⊆Δn
∀2 ≤n ≤N .

supp(δnF/δϕn) ⊆Δn
∀n ≥2 .
(1.3.16)

Chapter 1.

(2) We are going to show that (1.3.15) and the compactness of the support of fn
imply that
fn(x1, . . . , xn) = Sn

a
	
dx tn
a(x) ∂aδ(x1 −x, . . . , xn −x)
(1.3.17)
for some tn
a ∈D′(M, C) with compact support, where the sum over a is ﬁnite
and Sn denotes symmetrization in x1, . . . , xn. For this purpose we introduce
relative coordinates
˜fn(y, xn) := fn(x1, . . . , xn) ,
y := (x1 −xn, . . . , xn−1 −xn) .
It suﬃces to consider test functions of the form g(y, xn) = g1(y) g2(xn):
⟨˜fn, g⟩= ⟨⟨˜fn(y, xn), g1(y)⟩y, g2(xn)⟩xn .
From (1.3.15) and (A.1.17) we conclude that
⟨˜fn(y, xn), g1(y)⟩y =

a
tn
a(xn) ⟨∂aδ(y), g1(y)⟩y
for some tn
a, where the sum over a is ﬁnite. Since, for any ﬁxed g1, the map
D(M) ∋g2 −→⟨˜fn, g1 ⊗g2⟩=

a
(−1)|a| ∂ag1(0) ⟨tn
a(xn), g2(xn)⟩xn
is linear and continuous, each tn
a is a distribution. In addition, since fn has
compact support, this holds true also for each tn
a ∈D′(M, C). Summing up
we obtain
fn(x1, . . . , xn) =

a
	
dx δ(xn −x) tn
a(xn) ∂aδ(x1 −xn, . . . , xn−1 −xn) ,
which agrees with the assertion (1.3.17).
(3) Taking into account Exap. 1.2.3, it remains to verify that each tn
a is smooth.
It is only this step which uses any assumption about WF(fn). Heuristically, it
is clear that (1.3.14) implies smoothness of tn
a, because (1.3.14) can be under-
stood as the condition that “singularities may appear only in the dependence
on the relative coordinates”, as we see from (1.2.9). To show smoothness of
tn
a rigorously, we note that (1.3.14) implies that
ˆfn(k) ∼Sn

a
(−ik)a ˆtn
a(k1 + · · · + kn) ,
k ≡(k1, . . . , kn) ,
(which is obtained by Fourier transformation of (1.3.17)) decays rapidly in
all directions k except for k1 + · · · + kn = 0. Hence, ˆtn
a(p) decays rapidly in
all directions p ∈Rd \ {0}, that is, tn
a is smooth for all n and a.

Derivatives and support of functionals, local ﬁelds
15
Obviously, the weaker wave front set condition (1.2.2) does not suf-
ﬁce for this conclusion. A simple example are linear functionals: F(ϕ) =

dx f(x) ϕ(x) with f a distribution with compact support. They trivially
satisfy the condition (1.3.13): δ2F/δϕ2 = 0. If f satisﬁes only the wave front
set condition (1.2.2), it does not need to be smooth; but if it fulﬁlls the
stronger version (1.3.14), we have WF(f) = ∅, that is, f is smooth.
⊟
To simplify the notations, we sometimes work with the integral kernel A(x) instead
of A(g), and operations, which are deﬁned on Floc or F, are then applied to A(x),
although A(x) ̸∈F as explained in Exap. 1.2.4. Then, A(x) has to be understood
as A(g), g ∈D(M) arbitrary, in order that these operations are well deﬁned.
In particular, this yields the following deﬁnition of the functional derivative of
A(x), A ∈P:
	
dx g(x) δA(x)
δϕ(y) := δA(g)
δϕ(y)
∀g ∈D(M) .
(1.3.18)
Inserting (1.3.11), we obtain the explicit formula
δA(x)
δϕ(y) =

a∈Nd
(∂aδ)(x −y)
∂A
∂(∂aϕ)(x) .
(1.3.19)
By means of the Leibniz rule (1.3.4) for
δ
δϕ(y)

A1(g1) · · · Ar(gr)

we obtain the
deﬁnition of the functional derivative of a non-local ﬁeld monomial:

δϕ(y)
:=


j=1
A1(x1) · · · δAj(xj)
δϕ(y) · · · Ar(xr) ,
A1, . . . , Ar ∈P .
(1.3.20)
The functional derivative of an arbitrary (local or non-local) ﬁeld polynomial is
obtained from these formulas by linearity.
Example 1.3.7. For P(x1, x2, x3) := ϕ2(x1) □ϕ(x1) ϕ5(x2) + ∂μϕ∂μϕ(x3) we get
δP(x1, x2, x3)
δϕ(y)
= 2 δ(x1 −y) ϕ(x1) □ϕ(x1) ϕ5(x2) + (□δ)(x1 −y) ϕ2(x1) ϕ5(x2)
+ 5 δ(x2 −y) ϕ2(x1) □ϕ(x1) ϕ4(x2) + 2 (∂μδ)(x3 −y) ∂μϕ(x3) .
Remark 1.3.8 (Non-polynomial ﬁelds). One may go beyond Deﬁnition 1.2.1 to
include non-polynomial ﬁelds, in the following way (see [22, 27, 29, 63]). One can
redeﬁne F to be the set of functionals F : C −→R which are inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable
and all of whose functional derivatives are compactly supported distributions and
each WF(δnF/δϕn) satisﬁes (1.2.2). The deﬁnition of (continuous) diﬀerentiability
used in inﬁnite-dimensional calculus can be found, e.g., in [29, 129, 143].
Local functionals Floc ⊂F are then deﬁned by the extra conditions:
(i) Additivity:
F(f +g+h) = F(f +g)−F(g)+F(g+h)
if
supp f ∩supp h = ∅; (1.3.21)

16
Chapter 1.
Classical Field Theory
(ii) WF(δnF/δϕn) ⊥T Δn, where T Δn is the tangent bundle of the thin diagonal.
In other words, if (x, k) ∈WF(δnF/δϕn) and v ∈TxΔn, then ⟨k, v⟩= 0.
One can show that the additivity condition (i) is equivalent to the condition
(1.3.13) and that it is also equivalent to the seemingly stronger condition (1.3.16),
see [27, Lemma 3.1] and [29, Proposition 1]. So the equivalence (1.3.13) ⇔(1.3.16),
shown above for polynomial ﬁelds, holds true also for non-polynomial ﬁelds.
1.4
Balanced ﬁelds
There is a problem of non-uniqueness with the expression F = K
i=1 Ai(gi) (1.3.8)
for local ﬁelds: The pairs (Ai, gi)K
i=1 are not uniquely determined by F, since

dx ∂μ(A(x)g(x)) = 0 for any A ∈P and g ∈D(M). To remove this non-
uniqueness, we seek a subspace Pbal of P, called the space of “balanced ﬁelds”,
such that each element of P can be uniquely written as a ﬁnite sum of deriva-
tives of balanced ﬁelds. For example, ϕ∂μϕ cannot be a balanced ﬁeld, since
ϕ∂μϕ = ∂μ( 1
2 ϕ2).
In perturbative QFT, this result is crucial for the proof of the Action Ward
Identity [55],2 i.e., the statement that the retarded (or time-ordered) products can
be renormalized so that they commute with partial derivatives with respect to the
spacetime coordinates (see Sect. 3.1.1).
To ﬁnd the space of balanced ﬁelds, note that any A ∈P can be written as
A(x) = c +

is, pn(∂1, . . . , ∂n) = pn(∂π(1), . . . , ∂π(n)) for all π ∈Sn.
We can introduce derivatives with respect to relative and centre-of-mass coor-
dinates. We write ∂ij := ∂i−∂j for the relative derivatives, and ∂:= (∂1+· · ·+∂n)
for the centre-of-mass derivative. Note that the application of ∂x ≡
∂
∂x to A(x) is
described on the r.h.s. of (1.4.1) by a centre-of-mass derivative ∂. One can then
show that pn(∂1, . . . , ∂n) can be uniquely rewritten as

for some polynomial Pn respecting the permutation symmetry (1.4.3), are called
balanced ﬁelds. Obviously they form a vector space, which is denoted by Pbal.

The point is that Ba is uniquely determined by these properties, due to the unique-
ness of (1.4.2). Note that the constant ﬁeld c is absorbed in the summand a = 0.
This is part (a) of the following proposition [55, 57].

The ﬁeld equation
General references for the remainder of Chap. 1 are [16, 29, 54].

tion 1.2.1, since on writing S0 in the form (1.2.1) the pertinent f2 has non-compact
support; or, comparing with the deﬁnition of local ﬁelds (1.3.8), the function g be-
longing to S0 is g(x) = 1 for all x, which is not an element of D(M). This is not

d−1 →∞, i.e., in the “IR-region”.
This fact is ignored in many textbooks. If one restricts the functional S0 to
D(M, R) = { h: M →R | h is smooth and supp h is compact }, there is the un-
satisfactory feature that there does not exist any nontrivial solution of the Klein–
Gordon equation (□+ m2)ϕ(x) = 0 which has compact support.4
In this book we avoid this problem in the following way: Although S0 appears
as an index of several quantities, it is (apart from very few exceptions, in which
we understand S0 as “generalized Lagrangian” in the sense of Remk. 1.5.1) never
S0 itself which appears in the deﬁnition of these quantities or in any formula, only
the functional derivatives
δS0
δϕ(x) := −(□+ m2)ϕ(x) ,
δ2S0
δϕ(y) δϕ(x) := −(□+ m2)δ(x −y)
(1.5.2)
are used – and these are well deﬁned.
Remark 1.5.1 (Generalized Lagrangian). A rigorous deﬁnition of the free action
and of non-localized interactions as, e.g.,  dx ϕn(x) (n ∈N∗), can be given by
using the notion of a generalized Lagrangian, introduced in [27, Sect. 6.2], see also
[29, Sect. 3]. By deﬁnition, a generalized Lagrangian is a map
L : D(M) −→Floc
(1.5.3)
with the properties
supp L(f) ⊆supp f
∀f ∈D(M) ,
L(0) = 0
and the Additivity
L(f + g + h) = L(f + g) −L(g) + L(g + h)
if
supp f ∩supp h = ∅.
At ﬁrst glance, the latter seems to agree with (1.3.21). However note that, in
contrast to (1.3.21), the functions f, g and h appearing here are not ﬁeld con-
ﬁgurations; they play a diﬀerent role: They are elements of D(M), which switch
oﬀthe Lagrangian in the IR-region. We emphasize that the map (1.5.3) may be
non-linear.
The action S given by the generalized Lagrangian L is deﬁned as the equiva-
lence class of L, where two Lagrangians L1 and L2 are called equivalent, L1 ∼L2,

Localized and local interactions. As explained in the Preface, we work in pQFT
with localized interactions S, that is S ∈F, to separate the UV-problem form
the IR-problem. Therefore, we assume also in our treatment of clFT that the
interactions are of this kind, i.e., they are switched oﬀfor ∥x∥large enough. Due
to S ∈F, the problem discussed above for S0 does not appear. However, the
switching modiﬁes the usual ﬁeld equation.
We additionally assume that the interaction S is local: S ∈Floc, similarly to
many textbooks.5 More precisely we assume that S is of the simple form
S =
	
dx Lint(x) ;
where
Lint(x) = −κ g(x) Lint(x),
(1.5.4)
is the interaction Lagrangian, with Lint ∈Pbal, g ∈D(M) and so S ∈Floc. To
make visible the dependence on κ and to simplify the notations, we sometimes
write
κ ˜S := S ,
L(g) := S ,
L(g) := ˜S ,
that is,
L = κL = −κLint ∈κPbal .
The ﬁeld equation given by the total action S0 + S reads
δ(S0 + S)
δϕ(x)
= 0 .
If Lint depends only on ϕ and its ﬁrst derivatives ∂μϕ, this becomes the
Euler–Lagrange equation (by using Exer. 1.3.5):
∂(L0 + Lint)
∂ϕ
(x) −∂μ ∂(L0 + Lint)
∂(∂μϕ)
(x) = 0 .
For instance, if Lint = ϕk, we get (□+ m2)ϕ(x) = −κ g(x) k ϕk−1(x).

5Naturally, one may also consider non-local interactions in our formalism – see Remk. 1.9.4: But
local ones suﬃce, in this book, for the needs of pQFT.

to be added already for the free theory (κ = 0); the reason is the same as for the photon

Retarded ﬁelds
Interacting ﬁelds. The interacting ﬁeld ϕ(x) to the interaction S ∈Floc (we will
write ϕS(x) for this ﬁeld) should be deﬁned such that it solves the ﬁeld equation
given by S. In our formalism, this can be realized as follows: Denote the space of
smooth solutions of the ﬁeld equation by
CS0+S :=

h ∈C



 δ(S0 + S)
δϕ(x)
(h) = 0
∀x ∈M

;
in particular CS0 := { h ∈C


 (□+ m2)h(x) = 0 } . Therewith, we deﬁne:
Deﬁnition 1.6.1. An interacting ﬁeld belonging to a ﬁeld F ∈Floc and an inter-
action S, is given by taking7
FS := F


CS0+S
or
AS(x) := A(x)


CS0+S
(A ∈Pbal)
for the corresponding integral kernel.
Indeed, for A = ϕ, the ﬁeld ϕS(x) satisﬁes the ﬁeld equation. An unrestricted
ﬁeld F ∈Floc is called an “oﬀ-shell ﬁeld” and F


CS0+S is an “on-shell ﬁeld”; mostly
6The Jacobi identity is the relation

r
fabrfrcd + [cyclic permutations of (a, b, c)] = 0 .
7In principle, this F could also be non-local – see Remk. 1.9.4; but in view of pQFT it suﬃces
to study local F .

22
Chapter 1.
Classical Field Theory
we will use these notions with respect to the free action, i.e., for the restriction
to CS0.8
For a scalar ﬁeld the name “on-shell ﬁeld” is motivated by the following:
Restriction of the functionals F ∈F to CS0 means that the allowed conﬁgurations
h(x) solve the Klein–Gordon equation, that is, the support of ˆh(p) lies on the mass
shell
Hm := { p ∈Md


 p2 ≡(p0)2 −⃗p 2 = m2 } .
(1.6.1)
For an “oﬀ-shell ﬁeld” the allowed conﬁgurations are not restricted this way, how-
ever note that supp ˆh may have a non-empty intersection with the mass shell
Hm. Hence, “oﬀ-shell” does not mean “oﬀHm”, it only means “not restricted
to Hm”. In addition, we point out that for a Dirac spinor ﬁeld (introduced in
Sect. 5.1.1) the condition that a conﬁguration h ∈C∞(M, C4) solves the Dirac
equation (i/∂−m)h(x) = 0 is truly stronger than supp ˆh ⊆Hm.
Retarded wave operator. In perturbation theory, interacting ﬁelds are usually in-
terpreted as functionals on CS0; this corresponds to the interaction picture of QFT.
For this purpose we need retarded wave operators (also called “retarded, classical
Møller operators”), which map solutions of S0 into solutions of S0+S. However, in
pQFT there are good reasons to deﬁne the interacting ﬁelds as unrestricted func-
tionals, i.e., on C, see Remk. 3.6.5. Therefore, we deﬁne the retarded wave operators
as oﬀ-shell operators, i.e., as maps from C to C (instead of CS0 −→CS0+S).
Deﬁnition 1.6.2. [16] A retarded wave operator is a family of maps rS0+S,S0 : C −→
C, one for each local interaction S, such that:
(i) rS0+S,S0(h)(x) = h(x) for x “suﬃciently early”;
(ii) δ(S0 + S)
δϕ(x)
◦rS0+S,S0 =
δS0
δϕ(x) .
Remark 1.6.3. If h ∈CS0, i.e., h is a solution of the free theory, then rS0+S,S0(h) ∈
CS0+S is a solution of the interacting theory. Pictorially, the map h −→rS0+S,S0(h)
is shown in Figure 1.1 in which time is advancing vertically: h and r(h) coincide
before the support of S and separate within that support. Propagation with respect
to the free action is indicated by a straight line.
An arbitrary h ∈C is mapped by rS0+S,S0 to that solution f(x) of
−(□+ m2)f(x) +
δS
δϕ(x)(f) = g(x) ,
where
g(x) := −(□+ m2)h(x) ,
which agrees with h(x) for x “suﬃciently early”.
8This is the usual terminology for “on-/oﬀ-shell ﬁeld” in causal perturbation theory, which was
introduced by Raymond Stora [159]. The notion “on-/oﬀ-shell ﬁeld” appears, e.g., also in the
book [32] about “Classical Mechanics” – essentially with the same meaning. In Sect. 3.4 we
introduce and study the time-ordered and the retarded product of pQFT for on-shell ﬁelds.
Further explanations about the notions “on-” and “oﬀ-shell” are given in App. A.7.

The interpretation given in Remark 1.6.3 can be made explicit by considering the
case d = 2 and m = 0. Then, h(x0, x1) := a f

x0 ∓(x1 −b)

, where a, b ∈R
and f ∈C∞(R, R), is a smooth solution of the wave equation, that is, h ∈CS0.
Assuming that f is a smooth approximation of δ ∈D′(R), the straight line may
be approximately the support of h and the curved line the support of r(h).
In the framework of perturbation theory, i.e., in the sense of formal power
series in S (or in the coupling constant κ, if you prefer), retarded wave operators
always exist and are unique. A direct proof of this claim is given in Lemmas 1
and 2 of [16]. In this book we only give an implicit proof: In Proposition 1.9.1 we
shall show that the perturbative expansion (1.7.3) of the retarded ﬁelds F ret
S
:=
F ◦rS0+S,S0 (1.6.2) exists and is unique for all F, S ∈Floc.
Remark 1.6.4. Since rS0+S,S0 = Id +O(κ), the retarded wave operator is invertible
in the sense of formal power series, see (A.1.3). Due to this, we can deﬁne the
retarded wave operator connecting two interacting theories:
rS0+S1,S0+S2 := rS0+S1,S0 ◦(rS0+S2,S0)−1 .
Obviously it satisﬁes the property (i) of Def. 1.6.2 and the analogon of property
(ii):
δ(S0 + S1)
δϕ(x)
◦rS0+S1,S0+S2 = δ(S0 + S2)
δϕ(x)
;
and we also obtain
rS0+S1,S0+S2 ◦rS0+S2,S0+S3 = rS0+S1,S0+S3 .
Remark 1.6.5. Exact (i.e., non-perturbative) existence and uniqueness of retarded
wave operators depends on the interaction S. For non-localized interactions, i.e.,
S = −κ

dx Lint(x) with Lint ∈Pbal (note that there is no function g ∈D(M)
switching oﬀthe interaction for ∥x∥→∞), a lot is known about existence and
uniqueness of exact solutions of nonlinear wave equations (see, e.g., [4, 141, 153]).
A typical result is J¨orgens’ Theorem (from 1961), given, e.g., in Chapter 6 of [153]:

24
Chapter 1.
Classical Field Theory
Theorem 1.6.6 (Smooth solutions of the ϕ4-model). Let m > 0, κ > 0 and h, h1 ∈
D(R3) be given. Then the Cauchy problem
(□+ m2)f(t, ⃗x) + 4κ

f(t, ⃗x)
3 = 0,
f(0, ⃗x) = h(⃗x),
∂tf(0, ⃗x) = h1(⃗x)
has a unique solution f ∈C∞(R4).
It seems that for the corresponding localized interaction, S = −κ

dx g(x) ϕ4(x)
with g ∈D(R4) and g(x) ≥0 for all x, the existence and uniqueness of solutions
is even somewhat easier to prove. Hence, for this (localized) interaction S, it is
likely that the “on-shell” retarded wave operator rS0+S,S0|CS0 exists exactly and
is unique.
Retarded ﬁelds. In perturbative clFT one usually deals with Taylor expansions
with respect to κ; but, the ﬁelds to be expanded are not the interacting ﬁelds FS
(Deﬁnition 1.6.1) – one expands the so-called “retarded ﬁelds”, which are deﬁned
in terms of the retarded wave operator.
Deﬁnition 1.6.7. Given F ∈Floc and an interaction S ∈Floc, the retarded ﬁeld
F ret
S
is deﬁned by
F ret
S
:= F ◦rS0+S,S0 : C −→C,
(1.6.2)
and similarly Aret
S (x) := A(x) ◦rS0+S,S0 for A ∈Pbal.
Obviously, these two deﬁnitions are connected by

(1.6.4)
by replacing g ∈D(M) by ∂g and by performing integrations by parts.
These retarded (classical) ﬁelds factorize in the following sense: For A, B ∈
Pbal we obtain
(AB)ret
S (x)(h) = (AB)(x)(rS0+S,S0(h)) = A(x)(rS0+S,S0(h)) B(x)(rS0+S,S0(h))
= Aret
S (x)(h) Bret
S (x)(h),
that is to say,
(AB)ret
S (x) = Aret
S (x) · Bret
S (x)
(1.6.5)
as distributions Aret
S (x)(h) : D(M) ∋g −→A(g)ret
S (h) ∈C , h ∈C. This factor-
ization property of classical ﬁeld theory cannot be maintained in the quantization,
since pointwise products of distributions in general need not exist.

Due to linearity and symmetry (in the ﬁrst n arguments), it suﬃces to deﬁne this
on diagonal entries like ˜S⊗n – see (A.1.9). For n = 0, we obtain R0,1(F) = F.
The lower indices n, 1 indicate that Rn,1 has two kind of entries, the ﬁrst n for
the interaction and the last one for the pertinent ﬁeld at κ = 0.

(1.7.3)
where S = κ ˜S. A crucial point is that we understand the right-hand side of ≃as
formal power series in κ, i.e., as an element of F[[κ]] – see (A.1.1) for the notation.
That is, no convergence is implied. In clFT there are a lot of examples for which
the perturbation series (1.7.3) converges; but for all known, physically relevant
QFT-models in d = 4 dimensions, the series diverges and, even worse, it is an
open question whether an exact expression for F ret
S
(or for the S-matrix) exists.
To explain the last expression in (1.7.3) note that we have used the handy no-
tation (A.1.6) for the ﬁrst entry. There, we regard the (classical) retarded product
as a map9 R: T(κFloc) ⊗Floc −→F[[κ]], where (A.1.5) and (A.1.7) are used.

of T(κFloc) (where the completion is understood in the same way as in T(κFloc) (A.1.5)). However,
later on we will also work with retarded products Rn,1 whose ﬁrst n entries are non-diagonal (e.g.,
in the GLZ relation (1.10.3), which will play a crucial role), and for that it is more convenient
to have T(κFloc).

1.8
The Poisson algebra of the free theory
The algebraic structure of the set of classical observables is usually that of a
Poisson algebra, i.e., a commutative and associative algebra together with a second
operation: A Poisson bracket, satisfying the Leibniz rule and the Jacobi identity.
Hence, to complete our formulation of classical ﬁeld theory, we need to introduce a
Poisson bracket. We do this only for the free theory; this suﬃces for our purposes,
since in perturbation theory the interacting ﬁelds are interpreted as functionals
on CS0. For the deﬁnition of the Poisson bracket for an interacting theory, by
means of the Peierls bracket [133], and for a lot of further results about classical
ﬁeld theory in the present formalism, we refer to [16, 29, 54].
Retarded propagator. We will deﬁne the Poisson bracket by means of the retarded
propagator belonging to the free action S0.
Deﬁnition 1.8.1. Given the free ﬁeld equation (□+ m2)ϕ(x) = 0, the retarded
propagator Δret
m ∈D′(Rd) is deﬁned as the fundamental solution to the equation
(□+ m2)Δret
m (x) = −δ(x),
satisfying
supp Δret
m ⊆V + .
(1.8.1)
We point out that Δret
m is uniquely determined by the conditions (1.8.1).

[Hint: To be equipped with the Fourier transformation, consider Δret
m
as an element
of S′(Rd) and, to verify the diﬀerential equation, use (A.1.18). To check the support
property, assume m > 0 and perform the p0-integration for x0 < 0.]
[Solution: The statements (1.8.3) follow immediately from the Fourier representation
(1.8.2).

Chapter 1.

To prove (1.8.2), let f ∈S′(Rd) be the r.h.s. of this assertion. We are going to verify that
f fulﬁlls the deﬁning properties (1.8.1).

in the complex p0-plane, the two poles are in the lower half-plane. Because of |e−i p0 x0| =
eIm(p0) x0, the integrand decays suﬃciently fast in the upper half-plane, to conclude that
the integral (1.8.4) vanishes by a standard application of Cauchy’s Theorem.]

Due to the latter, Δret (d=4)
m
(g) is smooth in m ≥0 for all g ∈D(Rd); one
can show that this holds in any dimension d > 2. Hence, the retarded propagator
exists also for m = 0: Dret := Δret
m=0 is the retarded Green’s function of the wave
operator (up to a sign). For d = 4, Dret is given by the ﬁrst term in (1.8.5). With
that we obtain

the speed of light.
Poisson bracket. The propagator of the Poisson bracket is the antisymmetric part
of Δret
m , which is the “commutator function” Δm (up to factor 2):
Δm(x) := Δret
m (x) −Δret
m (−x).
(1.8.6)
From (1.8.1) we conclude that (□+ m2)Δm(x) = 0 and supp Δm ⊆(V + ∪V −).

Notice that Δret
m (x) = Δm(x) θ(x0): A pointwise product which exists, although
there is an overlapping singularity at x = 0 ! This is veriﬁed in Exer. A.3.4 by
using H¨ormander’s criterion for the wave front sets (given in App. A.3).
Also the commutator function is well deﬁned for m = 0; we write D := Δm=0.
Deﬁnition 1.8.3. The Poisson bracket of ﬁelds, with respect to the free action S0
(1.5.1), is the bilinear map F × F −→F given by
{F, G} :=
	
dx dy
δF
δϕ(x) Δm(x −y)
δG
δϕ(y) .
(1.8.8)
Here F and G are oﬀ-shell ﬁelds, i.e., they are not restricted by any ﬁeld
equation, in particular they “do not know anything about the mass m”. The
information about the free action (and the mass m) lies in the propagator: Δm
is a solution of the free ﬁeld equation. We emphasize that the Poisson bracket of
two local ﬁelds is in general non-local.
Example 1.8.4. Let
F :=

dx1dx2 f(x1, x2) ϕ(x1)∂μϕ(x2) = −


x2f(x1, x2) ϕ(x1)ϕ(x2) ∈F

dy1 g(y1) ϕk(y1) ∈Floc, where f ∈D′(M2) has compact support and satisﬁes
the wave front set property (1.2.2) and g ∈D(M). Using

δϕ(x) =


f(x, x1) ∂μϕ(x1) −∂μ

{F, G} =

Proposition 1.8.5 (Existence and properties of Poisson bracket, [51, 52]). The
Poisson bracket satisﬁes the following properties:
(i) The pointwise product of distributions in (1.8.8) exists, due to the wave front
set properties of F and G. Moreover, {F, G} again satisﬁes the wave front
set property (1.2.2), hence {F, G} ∈F.
(ii) The following algebraic relations are veriﬁed:
• {F, G} is bilinear in F and G;
• it is skew-symmetric: {G, F} = −{F, G};

30
Chapter 1.
Classical Field Theory
• the Leibniz rule holds: {F, GH} = {F, G} H + G {F, H};
• the Jacobi identity holds: {F, {G, H}}+{G, {H, F}}+{H, {F, G}} = 0.
Partial proof and comments. The ﬁrst part of item (i) can be proved by applying
a generalization of Thm. A.3.3 and by taking into account
WF(Δm) = { (x, k)


 x2 = 0, k2 = 0, x = λk for some λ ∈R, k0 ̸= 0 },
(1.8.9)
cf. (2.4.1).10
In item (ii), bilinearity is obvious, skew-symmetry follows from Δm(−x) =
−Δm(x), and the Leibniz rule from the analogous Leibniz rule for δ/δϕ. The
Jacobi identity is a corollary of the associativity of the star-product introduced in
Chap. 2; this is explained in Sect. 2.4.
If the propagator Δ ≡Δm of the Poisson bracket satisﬁes δΔ
δϕ = 0 – as it
holds true for the Poisson bracket of the free theory treated here, a direct proof
of the Jacobi identity is not a big deal [29]. Namely, using twice Def. 1.8.3, the
Leibniz rule for δ/δϕ and Δ(−z) = −Δ(z), we obtain

Remark 1.8.7. For local or non-local ﬁeld polynomials P(x1, . . . , xr), Q(y1, . . . , ys)
we deﬁne the Poisson bracket similarly to (1.8.8):
{P(x1, . . . ,xr), Q(y1, . . . , ys)}
:=
	
dx dy δP(x1, . . . , xr)
δϕ(x)
Δm(x −y) δQ(y1, . . . , ys)
δϕ(y)
,
where the functional derivative of P(x1, . . . , xr), Q(y1, . . . , ys) is deﬁned in (1.3.18)
and (1.3.20), see also Exap. 1.3.7.
We point out that

dy (□x + m2)Δm(x −y)
δF
δϕ(y) = 0
∀F ∈F .
1.9
An explicit formula for the classical
retarded product
From now on we do not assume non-perturbative existence and uniqueness of the
retarded wave operator.
A retarded product is now deﬁned to be a sequence R ≡(Rn,1)n∈N of maps
Rn,1 : F⊗n

we deﬁne R

S⊗n, A(x)

for A ∈Pbal in terms of R

S⊗n, A(g)

by (1.7.4). We recall
that this deﬁnition implies the relation (1.7.5). Additional deﬁning properties of
R are the factorization (1.7.6), the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation (1.7.7) and that R is
retarded, i.e., that it satisﬁes the relation (1.7.8).
We point out that the statements corresponding to the deﬁning properties of
a retarded wave operator (Def. 1.6.2), namely the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation and that
R is retarded (1.7.8), are contained in this deﬁnition.
In this section we derive an explicit formula for the classical retarded pro-
duct for three purposes: Firstly, this formula shows existence and uniqueness of
the classical retarded product; secondly, this formula will help us to ﬁnd simple
diagrammatic rules (“Feynman rules”) to compute Rn,1(⊗n
j=1Fj, F); and ﬁnally,
we will derive from this formula basic structural properties of the classical retarded
product (Sect. 1.10), which we want to maintain in the quantization (Sect. 3.1).
Proposition 1.9.1 (Existence, uniqueness and computation of retarded product,
[54]). The classical retarded product exists and is unique in the just deﬁned sense.

For all F ∈F, the pointwise product of distributions appearing in R(x)F exists

Suppose S =

For the inner retarded Poisson bracket we obtain
θ(y0 −x0
2) {ϕ4(x2), ϕ2(y)} = −8 ϕ(y) Δret(y −x2) ϕ3(x2) .
For the second retarded Poisson bracket we get two terms:

The large dots, labelled by x1, x2 and y, are called “vertices”. An “inner line” connecting
the vertices xi [or y] and xj symbolizes a propagator Δret(xi−xj) [or Δret(y−xj), resp.],
where xi is the vertex which is nearer to the ﬁeld vertex y – the inner lines are oriented
in this sense. An “external line” starting at the vertex xi stands for a factor ϕ(xi); and
the same for y instead of xi.
A nice feature of the result (1.9.7) is that the explicit time-ordering of the
vertices, given by the θ-functions in (1.9.6), has disappeared; there is only an
implicit time-ordering of the vertices due to supp Δret ⊂V +. This holds generally

We meet here a modiﬁed version of the Feynman diagrams: The vertices
symbolize functionals and, hence, there are no external lines. The diagrams con-
tributing to R(F1 ⊗F2 ⊗F3, F) are precisely all (topologically distinct) connected
tree diagrams12 with vertices F1, F2, F3 and F. This holds to all orders, as one
can derive from formula (1.9.8).13 That is, R(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn, F) can be obtained
by the following “Feynman rules”:
(1) sketch all (topologically distinct) connected tree diagrams which one can build
from the vertices F1, . . . , Fn, F and n inner lines.
(2) From each diagram read oﬀthe pertinent analytic expression, as explained
in (1.9.9)–(1.9.10). Then, R(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn, F) is (−1)n times the sum of all
these expressions.
12By a “tree diagram” we mean a diagram which does not contain any closed line; more precisely,
the set theoretic union of all (inner) lines and all vertices does not contain any closed line. A
tree diagram may be connected or disconnected.
13In Sect. 3.1.7 we prove in a somewhat diﬀerent way that only connected tree diagrams con-
tribute to the classical retarded product.

Sketch proof of Proposition 1.9.1. The existence of R(x)F and the relation
	
dx R(x)F ∈F
can be shown analogously to the proof of part (i) of Proposition 1.8.5.
Turning to the proof of (1.9.2), we denote the right-hand side of this equation
by R0
n,1(S⊗n, F). We have to show that the sequence R0 = (R0
n,1) solves the
deﬁning properties for R = (Rn,1) given at the beginning of this section and that
this solution is unique.
Obviously, R0(S⊗n, F) depends linearly on S⊗n ⊗F. The property
∂zR0(eS
⊗, A(z)) = R0(eS
⊗, ∂zA(z))
follows immediately from the deﬁnition of R0.
Next one shows that R0 satisﬁes the factorization property (1.7.6). This can
be done by using the Leibniz rule and taking careful account of integration regions
x0
1 ≤· · · ≤x0
n – see the proof of [54, Propos. 3].
That R0 is retarded (1.7.8), follows from
RS(x)A(z) = −
	
dy
δS
δϕ(x) Δret(y −x) δA(z)
δϕ(y) = 0
if
z ̸∈(supp S + V +) ,
which relies on (1.3.19) and supp Δret ⊆V +.
Turning to the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation (1.7.7), that is
R0


Finally, to prove uniqueness of R0, it suﬃces to prove uniqueness of
R0(eS
⊗, ϕ(z)); this follows from the factorization property (1.7.6). For simplicity,
we now restrict to the case S = −κ

dx g(x) ϕk(x); with that the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld
equation (1.7.7) is equivalent to the simpler diﬀerential equation (1.6.7), due to
the factorization (1.7.6). R0(eS
⊗, ϕ(z)) solves (1.6.7), because it satisﬁes (1.7.6):

(1.9.12)
The point is now that perturbative, retarded solutions of (1.6.7) are unique. This
can be seen as follows: Writing ϕn(z) :=

ϕn1(z) · · · ϕnk−1(z) .
(1.9.13)
Constructing the sequence (ϕn) by induction on n, we know the right-hand side.
The boundary condition ϕn(z) = 0 for z “suﬃciently early” determines the solu-
tion of (1.9.13) uniquely: ϕn(z) = −

dx Δret
m (z −x) f(x), where f(z) denotes the
right-hand side of (1.9.13).
By this proof of (1.9.2) we have shown that the classical retarded product
exists and is unique.
□
Remark 1.9.4 (Retarded products with non-local entries). Deﬁnitions 1.6.2, 1.6.7
and 1.7.1 of the retarded wave operator rS0+S,S0, the retarded ﬁeld F ret
S
and the
(classical) retarded product Rn,1(S⊗n, F), respectively, can directly be applied to
arbitrary S, F ∈F; the retarded product to nth order is then a map Rn,1 : F⊗n ⊗
F −→F. But formula (1.9.2) holds true only for local entries S, F ∈Floc. An
explicit expression for the computation of Rn,1 for non-local entries is given in
[16, Eq. (2.21)], see also [54, Eqs. (40)–(42)].

Chapter 1.

1.10
Basic properties of the retarded product
In this section we point out some fundamental structural properties of the classical
retarded product, which we will use as deﬁning axioms for the retarded product
(i.e., the interacting ﬁelds) of pQFT in Sect. 3.1.
(1) Causality: We ﬁrst consider the expression (1.9.3) for R(S, F). Due to
supp Δret ⊆V + ,
the integration over x is restricted to x ∈(supp F + V −); therefore, the
relation
R(S + H, F) = R(S, F)
if

supp F + V −

∩supp H = ∅.
holds true. Turning to higher orders we note that, e.g.,
	
dy Δret(x2−x1) Δret(y−x2) Δret(y−x3)
δF
δϕ(y) = 0 if xj ̸∈(supp F +V −)
for at least one j ∈{1, 2, 3}. In general we conclude from formula (1.9.2) for
R(S⊗n, F), supp Δret ⊆V + and V + + V + = V + that
R(eS+H
⊗
, F) = R(eS
⊗, F)
if

supp F + V −

∩supp H = ∅.
(1.10.1)
(2) Field independence: Applying δ/δϕ(z) to the expression (1.9.3) for R(S, F)
we get

δϕ(z) R(S, F) = R
 δS
δϕ(z), F

(1.10.2)
that is, the retarded product itself does not depend on ϕ, due to δΔret/δϕ=0.
In a Taylor expansion of the retarded product Rn−1,1(F1⊗· · · , Fn) with
respect to ϕ , one may apply the relation (1.10.2) to the Taylor coeﬃcients;
in QFT this leads to the causal Wick expansion of retarded products [66],
see Sect. 3.1.4.
(3) The GLZ relation: So called after Glaser, Lehmann and Zimmermann [84].
Proposition 1.10.1 ([54]). Let F, H, S ∈Floc. Then the Poisson bracket of
two interacting ﬁelds satisﬁes the relation:

⊗, F), R(eS
⊗, H)

d
dλ.

1.10.
Basic properties of the retarded product
39
Note that both sides of the GLZ relation are manifestly antisymmetric
under F ↔H. For S = 0 the GLZ relation reduces to {F, H} = R(F, H) −
R(H, F), which is (1.9.4).
From Causality we know that
supp R

eS
⊗⊗A(x), B(y)

⊆{ (x, y) ∈M2 

 x ∈(y + V −) } ,
supp R

eS
⊗⊗B(y), A(x)

⊆{ (x, y) ∈M2 

 x ∈(y + V +) }
for A, B ∈Pbal; hence, the GLZ relation implies
supp


⊗, A(x)

, R

eS
⊗, B(y)

⊆{ (x, y) ∈M2 

 (x −y)2 ≥0 } , (1.10.4)
so in particular, the Poisson bracket vanishes when x and y are spacelike
separated.
The GLZ relation, combined with causality, is the key for Steinmann’s
inductive construction of the retarded product of pQFT [155], which we will
adopt in a diﬀerent framework – see Sect. 3.2. The basic idea is the following:
Assuming that the Rk,1 are known for 1 ≤k ≤n, we can compute the left-
hand side of (1.10.3) to order n in S, which is equal to the diﬀerence of two
Rn+1,1 terms (on the right-hand side) with split supports, which allows one
to extract the individual Rn+1,1.
The proof of the GLZ relation given in [54] uses Peierls’ deﬁnition of the Poisson
bracket for interacting theories. Since we have not introduced the Poisson bracket
in this generality, we omit this proof; as a substitute we verify explicitly the GLZ
relation to lowest orders (Exer. 1.10.3) and for particularly simple interacting ﬁelds
(Exer. 1.10.2(c)).
We ﬁnish the chapter about Classical Field Theory with these exercises and
some further ones.

Chapter 2
Deformation Quantization
of the Free Theory
For this chapter, see the references [27, 51, 52, 55]. The basic reference for deforma-
tion quantization is due to Bayen, Flato, Fronsdal, Lichnerowicz and Sternheimer [6].
This seminal paper relies on much earlier work of John von Neumann [130] and on
Gerstenhaber’s algebraic deformation theory [83], and it gives an axiomatic formula-
tion of the heuristic quantization formulas found by Weyl [169], Groenewold [89] and
Moyal[126]. Further groundbreaking progress in the development of deformation quanti-
zation has been achieved (among others and in historical order) by De Wilde and Lecomte
[33], Fedosov [70, 71] and Kontsevich [115, 116]. The book [165] gives a detailed intro-
duction to deformation quantization. For the application to free ﬁelds we refer also to
[19, 35, 36, 99, 166].
Deformation quantization is a way to quantize a classical mechanical system/
classical ﬁeld theory to obtain a pertinent quantum mechanical system/quantum
ﬁeld theory. It focuses on the algebra of observables of a physical system: It pro-
vides rules for how to deform the commutative algebra of classical observables
to a noncommutative algebra of quantum observables. Usually (and also in this
book) deformation quantization refers to formal deformations, in the sense that
the deformed product is a formal power series in Planck’s constant ℏ.
Given a Poisson algebra (A, {·, ·}), a deformation quantization is a bilinear
and associative product ⋆on A × A (“star product”) with values in A[[ℏ]] (see
(A.1.1)), subject to the following two axioms:
f ⋆g = fg + O(ℏ),
[f, g]⋆:= f ⋆g −g ⋆f = iℏ{f, g} + O(ℏ2)
(2.0.1)
for all f, g ∈A. The star product corresponds to the operator product, if the
quantum observables are represented by linear operators on a Hilbert space, as,
e.g., in Schr¨odingers formulation of quantum mechanics. The second axiom in
(2.0.1) is a precise formulation of the heuristic rule that under quantization the
Poisson bracket is replaced by the commutator.

Chapter 2. Deformation Quantization of the Free Theory
2.1
Star products of ﬁelds
We seek a deformation ⋆ℏ: F × F −→F[[ℏ]] of the classical product of ﬁelds. The
new product should be:
(a) bilinear in its arguments;
(b) associative; and moreover should satisfy:
(c) F ⋆ℏG →F · G (the classical product) as ℏ→0;
(d) (F ⋆ℏG −G ⋆ℏF)/iℏ→{F, G} (the Poisson bracket) as ℏ→0.
Since we have not introduced a topology on F[[ℏ]], the “classical limit ℏ→0” is
obtained by simply setting ℏ:= 0, so that formal series in ℏare truncated at their
ℏ0-terms.
Further requirements on ⋆ℏwill emerge later on. For convenience, we abbre-
viate ⋆ℏsimply as ⋆when no confusion is likely to arise.
We make the Ansatz that
ϕ(x) ⋆ϕ(y) = ϕ(x) ϕ(y) + ℏH(x −y)
(2.1.1)
for some ﬁxed distribution H ∈D′(Rd), which must fulﬁll certain properties,
which we are now going to explain. Condition (d) determines the antisymmetric
part of H:
1
i

H(x −y) −H(y −x)

= {ϕ(x), ϕ(y)} = Δm(x −y).
(2.1.2)
With F0 := F|CS0, we get (□+ m2)ϕ0 = 0, i.e., ϕ0 is a solution of the
homogeneous Klein–Gordon equation. The following extra requirements on the
star products may now be added:
(e) Requiring (□x + m2)

ϕ(x) ⋆ϕ(y)

0 = 0, we ask that H = Hm depends on m
and that
(□x + m2)Hm(x −y) = 0.
(2.1.3)
Hence, the ⋆-product depends on m via Hm; to emphasize that, we sometimes
write ⋆m instead of ⋆.
(f) Lorentz invariance: we require that
Hm(Λz) = Hm(z)
for all
Λ ∈L↑
+.
(2.1.4)
To motivate the last two conditions on Hm, we ﬁrst deﬁne F ⋆G in terms of Hm
for arbitrary F, G ∈F[[ℏ]].

2.1.
Star products of ﬁelds
47
Deﬁnition 2.1.1 (Star product, [51, 52, 55]). If the distribution Hm is known, the
general deﬁnition of a star product ⋆ℏ: F[[ℏ]] × F[[ℏ]] −→F[[ℏ]] is given by
F ⋆ℏG :=
∞

n=0
ℏn
n!
	
dx1 · · · dxn dy1 · · · dyn
(2.1.5)
·
δnF
δϕ(x1) · · · δϕ(xn)
n

l=1
Hm(xl −yl)
δnG
δϕ(y1) · · · δϕ(yn) .
For 1 ∈F, i.e., 1(h) = 1 ∀h ∈C, we get 1 ⋆ℏF = F = F ⋆ℏ1.
Substituting ϕ(x) and ϕ(y) for F and G, resp., formula (2.1.5) reduces to
the Ansatz (2.1.1). In addition, it is obvious that this Deﬁnition of F ⋆G satisﬁes
the requirements bilinearity (a) and the ﬁrst limit (c): In the limit limℏ→0 F ⋆ℏG
only the (n = 0)-term survives and, for F, G ∼ℏ0, this limit is equal to F · G.
Likewise, the second limit (d): In (F ⋆ℏG −G ⋆ℏF) there is no term ∼ℏ0, hence
the limit limℏ→0(F ⋆ℏG −G ⋆ℏF)/iℏexists and, for F, G ∼ℏ0, it is equal to
	
dx dy
δF
δϕ(x)
1
i

H(x −y) −H(y −x)

δG
δϕ(y) = {F , G} ,
due to (2.1.2). The associativity (b) is more diﬃcult to prove; we defer this to
Sect. 2.4.
The “integral” on the r.h.s. of (2.1.5) is ﬁnite for ∥xj∥→∞or ∥yj∥→∞,
because
δnF
δϕ(x1)···δϕ(xn)(h) and
δnG
δϕ(y1)···δϕ(yn)(h) (h ∈C arbitrary) are distributions
with compact support. But, the r.h.s. of (2.1.5) contains pointwise products of
distributions, which may have overlapping singularities (cf. Thm. A.3.3)! In order
that these pointwise products exist and that the result F ⋆ℏG lies indeed in F[[ℏ]],
we need to restrict Hm further; see the requirement (g) below and Sect. 2.4.
Note also that this deﬁnition is given on F[[ℏ]]×F[[ℏ]] instead of only on F×F.
Since the elements of F are polynomials in ϕ, the following holds: Let Fℏbe the
space of ﬁelds which are polynomials in ℏ, more precisely
Fℏ:=
 S

s=0
Fs ℏs 


 Fs ∈F , S < ∞

.
(2.1.6)
We conclude that for F, G ∈Fℏthe sum over n in formula (2.1.5) for F ⋆ℏG is
ﬁnite14 and, hence, F ⋆ℏG ∈Fℏ; that is, the star product can be interpreted as a
map ⋆: Fℏ× Fℏ−→Fℏ.
Analogously to our procedure for the Poisson bracket (Remk. 1.8.7), we adopt
formula (2.1.5) to deﬁne P(x1, . . . , xr)⋆ℏQ(y1, . . . , ys) for (local or non-local) ﬁeld
polynomials P(x1, . . . , xr) and Q(y1, . . . , ys): We simply substitute the latter two
for F and G, resp., in (2.1.5); see Exap. 2.1.2 below.
14Note that for ∞
s=0 Fs ℏs ∈F[[ℏ]] the set of the degrees of the polynomials (in ϕ) Fs, s ∈N,
may be unbounded.

48
Chapter 2. Deformation Quantization of the Free Theory
Another way of writing (2.1.5), which is convenient for some proofs (in par-
ticular for the proof of the associativity of the star product), is the following:
F ⋆G = M ◦eℏDH(F ⊗G)
where
DH :=
	
dx dy Hm(x −y)
δ
δϕ(x) ⊗
δ
δϕ(y) .
(2.1.7)
In addition, M denotes the pointwise (or classical) multiplication (1.2.5), that is,
M:

F ⊗F −→F
M(F ⊗G)(h) := F(h)G(h) ,
∀h ∈C ,
(2.1.8)
and
eℏDH := Id ⊗Id +
∞

k=1
ℏk
k! (DH)k
is understood as formal power series in ℏ.
From the following example, we ﬁnd a necessary condition for the existence
of the r.h.s. of the deﬁnition (2.1.5).
(g) all powers
Hm(x −y)l,
for
l = 2, 3, . . . ,
must exist.
(2.1.9)
Example 2.1.2. Let us compute the star product ϕ(x1) ϕ2(x2)⋆ϕ2(y). The general formula
above indicates that the expansion in powers of ℏstops at order O(ℏ2). The h0-term is the
classical product. For the computation of the functional derivatives see (1.3.18)–(1.3.20).
Altogether, we ﬁnd ﬁve terms:
ϕ(x1) ϕ2(x2) ⋆ϕ2(y) = ϕ(x1) ϕ2(x2) ϕ2(y)
+ ℏ

2ϕ2(x2) H(x1 −y) ϕ(y) + 4ϕ(x1) ϕ(x2) H(x2 −y) ϕ(y)

+ ℏ2
2

4ϕ(x2) H(x1 −y) H(x2 −y) + 4ϕ(x1) H(x2 −y)2
.
The appearance of H(xk −y) is called a “contraction of ϕ(xk) with ϕ(y)”. Diagrammat-
ically, the listed terms correspond to the following contraction schemes:

Comparing with Fock space calculations, we remark that if the classical, pointwise pro-
duct is interpreted as the normally ordered product, then this computation arises from
Wick’s Theorem (A.5.33), see Exap. 2.6.4.
h) the last condition for Hm is
Hm(x) = Hm(−x),
which is equivalent to
(F ⋆G)∗= G∗⋆F ∗, (2.1.10)
due to (
δnF
δϕ(x1)···δϕ(xn))∗=
δnF ∗
δϕ(x1)···δϕ(xn). A main motivation for this condition
is given in Exer. 2.5.5.

and
[F, G]⋆ℏ:= F ⋆ℏG−G⋆ℏF = 0
for all
G ∈F[[ℏ]] , (2.1.11)
due to (2.1.3).
We also remark that the star product commutes with the ﬁeld parity trans-
formation α given in (1.10.6): By using α

(2.2.1)
(cf. (A.5.1)), that is to say, the “positive frequencies of iΔm” (since i
Δm(p) ∼
sgn p0 δ(p2 −m2)). In other words, taking account of sgn(p0) = θ(p0)−θ(−p0), we
get
iΔm(z) = Δ+
m(z) −Δ+

(2.2.2)

where the Psi-function (also called “Digamma function”) is related to the Gamma-
function by ψ(x) := Γ′(x) / Γ(x). A proof of the result (2.2.3) is given, e.g., in
[12, Sect. 15.1] or [148, Sect. 2.3]; a derivation of the corresponding formula for
the Euclidean propagator is sketched in Exap. 3.9.2. Note that the ﬁrst term in
(2.2.3) is D+(z), the solution for m = 0; it is computed in Exer. 2.2.2 below. The
limit
D+ := lim
m↓0 Δ+
m
exists in any dimension d ≥3,
(2.2.6)
for the usual (weak) convergence in D′(Rd), see (A.1.15).
Veriﬁcation of the requirements on Hm = Δ+
m: As already noted in (2.2.2),
Δ+
m satisﬁes (2.1.2). Due to
F[(□+ m2)Δ+
m](p) ∼(−p2 + m2) θ(p0) δ(p2 −m2) = 0
(where F denotes Fourier transformation), Δ+
m satisﬁes the homogeneous Klein–
Gordon equation (2.1.3). The Lorentz invariance (2.1.4) and the relation (2.1.10)
are obvious. The property (2.1.9) can be veriﬁed by using H¨ormander’s wave front
set criterion (Thm. A.3.3) – see Exer. 2.2.1(b) below.16 Since Δ+
m is the positive
15In [143] there is a mistake in the interpretation of its formula (5.5): The relation

where

is the symmetric part of Δ+, is not the splitting into positive and negative frequencies.
16A possible alternative to the use of wave front sets is to employ Riesz functions, for which all
complex powers exist: See [4], for instance.

frequency part of iΔm, the wave front set of Δ+
m is the (k0 > 0)-part of WF(Δm)
(given in (1.8.9)):
WF(Δ+
m) = { (x, k)


 x2 = 0, k2 = 0, x = λk for some λ ∈R, k0 > 0 } . (2.2.7)
In particular note that the singular support of Δ+
m is the light cone x0 = ±|⃗x|;
and for x = 0 the pertinent k-vectors of WF(Δ+
m) are
WF(Δ+
m)


x=0 = {

0 , (|⃗k|,⃗k)
 

⃗k ∈(R3 \ {0}) } .
We also point out that WF(Δ+
m) does not depend on m, which is a heuristic
explanation for WF(D+) = WF(Δ+
m).
Exercise 2.2.1.

m(−x) does
not; by computing

(b) Use the result (2.2.7) to show that each power (Δ+
m)l, l ∈N∗, exists.
(Additional exercise for a Reader advanced in microlocal analysis: Derive formula
(2.2.7).)
[Solution: (a) Changing the order of integrations the integral can be written as

For Δ+
m(x)2 the integral exists, since ˆf is fast decreasing. But for Δ+
m(x)Δ+
m(−x) there
is no decay in the directions ⃗p ≈−⃗q , |⃗p| →∞.
(b) We proceed by induction on l and use Thm. A.3.3: Assuming that (Δ+
m)l exists and
WF

(Δ+)l
⊂Rd × (V + \ {0}) ,
(2.2.8)
this theorem says that (Δ+)l(x)Δ+(x) exists and fulﬁlls also (2.2.8), because k1, k2 ∈
V + \ {0} implies (k1 + k2) ∈V + \ {0}.
For a derivation of formula (2.2.7) for WF(Δ+
m) we refer to the literature, e.g., [21,
Prop. 25] or [141, Vol. II, Thm. IX.48].]
From the deﬁnition (2.2.1), we see that Δ+
m satisﬁes the same homogeneous
scaling property as Δret
m (1.8.3):
ρd−2Δ+
m/ρ(ρx) = Δ+
m(x).
(2.2.9)
An important property of Δ+
m is positivity:
⟨h, Δ+
m h⟩= 2π
	
ddp θ(p0) δ(p2 −m2) |ˆh(p)|2 ≥0
∀h ∈D(M) ,
(2.2.10)
where we use a notation introduced in (2.1.13). Positivity is necessary, in order
that we can interpret the functional F ∋F −→F


ϕ=0 ∈C as (vacuum) state, as
explained in Sect. 2.5, see in particular Deﬁnition 2.5.2.
A disadvantage of Δ+
m is that it is not smooth in the mass m ≥0, due to
the presence of the log(m2) term in (2.2.3). However, smoothness can be reached
using Hadamard functions instead.

Hadamard function. A second candidate for the propagator Hm of the star pro-
duct is the so-called Hadamard function (or functions). These are needed for doing
QFT on curved backgrounds, or QED with an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. We
shall use them in Minkowski spacetime. Our formulation of perturbative QFT
given in the main text (in Chaps. 3–5) is based on quantization with the Wight-
man two-point function. The modiﬁcations appearing when quantizing with a
Hadamard function are given in App. A.4.
To introduce the Hadamard function, let μ > 0 be a mass parameter. For a
given μ and with d = 4, the Hadamard function is the distribution Hμ
m deﬁned by
Hμ
m(z) := Δ+
m(z) −m2 f(m2z2) log(m2/μ2) ,
(2.2.13)
where f is the analytic function (2.2.4). Thus, the log(−m2
4 (z2 −iz00)) factor
in (2.2.3) is replaced by log(−μ2
4 (z2 −iz00)).
The diﬀerence g(z) := Hμ
m(z)−Δ+
m(z) is even, i.e., g(−z) = g(z), so that Hμ
m
also fulﬁlls (2.1.2). Moreover, by using Bessel’s diﬀerential equation one veriﬁes
(□+ m2)g = 0; hence, (2.1.3) is satisﬁed, too. Since g(Λz) = g(z), we also get the
Lorentz invariance (2.1.4), and g(z) = g(z) = g(−z) implies (2.1.10).
Since g is smooth in z, we ﬁnd that WF(Hμ
m) = WF(Δ+
m) and thus (Hμ
m)l
also exists for each l ∈N. We obtain the nicer property that
Hμ
m is smooth in m ≥0.

Equivalence of the several star products

However, the scaling homogeneity is broken by a logarithmic term:
ρ2Hμ
m/ρ(ρy) −Hμ
m(y) = 2m2 f(m2z2) log ρ
(2.2.15)
for d = 4. An even more severe disadvantage of quantization with a Hadamard
function is that positivity (2.2.10) may be violated: From
⟨h, Hμ
m h⟩= ⟨h, Δ+
m h⟩−m2 log(m2/μ2) f[h, h] ,
(2.2.16)
where
f[h, h] :=
	
dx dy h(x) f

m2(x −y)2
h(y) ,
we see that for each h ∈D(M) with f[h, h] > 0 [or f[h, h] < 0] there exists a
μ(h) ∈(0, m) [or μ(h) ∈(m, ∞)] such that ⟨h, Hμ
m h⟩< 0 if and only if 0 < μ <
μ(h) [or μ > μ(h), respectively].
Finally, we get
lim
m↓0 Hμ
m = D+ ≡lim
m↓0 Δ+
m
in
D′(Rd) .
On the matter of uniqueness of Hμ
m – see17 [27, App. A], [114, Chap. III.3] and
[63, Sect. IV.B] – we remark (without proof) that the listed properties determine
Hμ
m, up to the parameter μ, in even dimensions d. More precisely, the conditions
(2.1.2) to (2.1.4) and (2.1.9), (2.1.10), plus (2.2.14) and the condition that
ρd−2Hμ
m/ρ(ρz) is a polynomial in log ρ
(2.2.17)
as a replacement for (2.2.15), determine Hμ
m uniquely, up to the choice of μ > 0.
In odd dimensions, there are crucial diﬀerences: Firstly, the Wightman two-
point function Δ+
m is smooth in the mass m ≥0. There is also a one-parameter
solution set of the just given conditions, which includes Δ+
m. But, secondly, all
solutions scale homogeneously, because no mass parameter μ enters here. (If one
demands the stronger condition of smoothness in the squared mass m2, not just
in m, then there is a unique solution Hm – which is not equal to Δ+
m.)

Equivalence of the several star products
Two products ×l : F × F −→F, where l = 1, 2, are called equivalent, if and only if
there exists an algebra isomorphism L: (F, ×1) −→(F, ×2), that is, L is invertible,
linear and intertwines the two products:
L(F ×1 G) = (LF) ×2 (LG)
(cf. App. A.1). We start with a preparatory exercise.
17The derivation of the general solution for the Hadamard function in even dimensions d, given
in the ﬁrst reference, contains a mistake, which is corrected in the other two references.

Chapter 2. Deformation Quantization of the Free Theory
Exercise 2.3.1. Let us replace the distribution Hm in formula (2.1.5) by a smooth func-
tion p ∈C∞(Rd), to get a “product with propagator p”, denoted F ⋆p G. With this
replacement, the r.h.s. of (2.1.5) exists, because the distributions
δnF
δϕ(x1)···δϕ(xn)(h) and
δnG
δϕ(y1)···δϕ(yn)(h) (h ∈C arbitrary) have compact support.
If p(z) = p(−z), we immediately see that ⋆p is commutative. The aim of this
exercise is to show that, in this case, ⋆p is equivalent to the classical product: Write

Equivalence of the several star products
55
To understand formula (2.3.3) diagrammatically ﬁrst note that, for any H ≡
H(ϕ) ∈F, the term eΓpH is the sum over all possible contractions (with propa-
gator p) of the entries ϕ in H(ϕ). Applying this to the r.h.s. of (2.3.3), that is,
to H = (e−ΓpF) · (e−ΓpG), we see that the operators e−Γp remove the tadpole
diagrams, i.e., the contractions of F with F and of G with G, respectively. There
remains the sum over all possible contractions of F with G, which is indeed equal
to F ⋆p G.
Due to property (d), a star product is non-commutative; hence, it cannot be
equivalent to the classical product. However, the next exercise shows that the star
products of Sect. 2.2 are equivalent to one another.
Exercise 2.3.2. Let d = 4. We write the notations

Chapter 2. Deformation Quantization of the Free Theory
Remark 2.3.3 (Time-ordered product of regular ﬁelds). The distribution
ΔF
m(x) := θ(x0) Δ+
m(x) + θ(−x0) Δ+
m(−x)
(2.3.8)
is called the Feynman propagator. On the right-hand side of (2.3.8), both pointwise
products of distributions exist, as shown in Exer. A.3.4. Due to Δ+
m(x) = Δ+
m(−x)
for x2 < 0 (cf. the proof of Lemma 2.4.1), the deﬁnition (2.3.8) can be written in
a manifestly Lorentz invariant way for x ̸= 0:
ΔF
m(x) :=

Δ+
m(x)
for
x ̸∈V −
Δ+
m(−x)
for
x ̸∈V + .
(2.3.9)
Trying to introduce a “time-ordered product” by applying the deﬁnition of
⋆p : F × F −→F (given in Exer. 2.3.1) to p = ΔF
m, we meet the problem that ΔF
m
is not smooth; the pointwise product of distributions appearing in F ⋆ΔF
m G does
not exist for arbitrary F, G ∈F, because, e.g., powers of ΔF
m do not exist.
A way out is to restrict ⋆ΔF
m to “regular ﬁelds” , which are deﬁned as follows:
The space Freg of regular ﬁelds, is the subspace of F given by the additional
condition that the several fn in (1.2.1) are smooth functions, i.e., fn ∈D(Mn) for
all n ≥1. If F = 
n⟨fn, ϕ⊗n⟩∈Freg and fn ̸= 0 for some n ≥2, then F ̸∈Floc;
this is an immediate consequence of the ﬁrst property in (1.3.12) of local ﬁelds.
For regular ﬁelds the “time-ordered product”
τ2 :

Freg ⊗Freg −→Freg
τ2(F ⊗G) := F ⋆ΔF
m G ,
exists, because for F, G ∈Freg the nth functional derivatives
δnF
δϕ(x1)···δϕ(xn) and
δnG
δϕ(y1)···δϕ(yn), appearing in the general deﬁnition (2.1.5), depend smoothly on
(x1, . . . , xn) and (y1, . . . , yn), respectively. The name “time-ordered product” is
due to the property
F ⋆ΔF
m G =

F ⋆m G
if
supp F ∩(supp G + V −) = ∅
G ⋆m F
if
supp G ∩(supp F + V −) = ∅,
which follows immediately from (2.3.9).
On account of ΔF
m(−x) = ΔF
m(x), formula (2.3.3) applies, i.e., ⋆ΔF is equi-
valent to the classical product. Therefore, τ2 is associative and we may introduce
time-ordered products of higher orders: τn : F⊗n
reg −→Freg is deﬁned by iteration
of τ2, which is equivalent to
τn(F1⊗· · ·⊗Fn) := F1⋆ΔF · · ·⋆ΔF Fn = eΓΔF

(e−ΓΔF F1) · · · (e−ΓΔF Fn)

(2.3.10)
by using (2.3.3). So the algebraic structure of this time-ordered product τn is the
same as that of the n-fold classical product.

2.4.
Existence and properties of the star product
57
However, the (renormalized) time-ordered product Tn relevant for perturba-
tive QFT (introduced in Sect. 3.3) is a map Tn : F⊗n
loc −→F. Therefore, T2 cannot
be associative, Tn cannot be obtained as an iteration of T2, and Tn cannot be equi-
valent to the n-fold classical product. In addition, for local entries F1, F2 ∈Floc,
the expression F1⋆ΔF F2 does not exist in general, for the same reason as explained
above for F1, F2 ∈F – renormalization is the removal of these divergences.
Nevertheless, a way to understand the renormalized time-ordered product
Tn as an iteration of a binary product deﬁned on a suitable domain, which is
equivalent to the classical product (and hence associative and commutative), is
given in [74].
2.4
Existence and properties of the star product
The existence of the general formula (2.1.5) for F ⋆G amounts to the following
problem (by using Deﬁnition 1.3.1 of the functional derivative): Writing F =

k⟨fk, ϕ⊗k⟩and G = 
l⟨gl, ϕ⊗l⟩with fk and gl as in Deﬁnition 1.2.1, we have
to show that
t(z1, . . ., zk+l−2n) := S
	
dx1 · · · dxn dy1 · · · dyn fk(x1, . . . , xn, z1, . . . , zk−n)
·
n

j=1
H(xj −yj) gl(y1, . . . , yn, zk−n+1, . . . , zk+l−2n)
(2.4.1)
(S denotes symmetrization in z1, . . . , zk+l−2n), which contains pointwise products
of distributions, exists in D′(Mk+l−2n). In addition, to conﬁrm that F ⋆G lies
again in F[[ℏ]], we have to verify that t(z1, . . . , zk+l−2n) fulﬁlls the wave front set
condition (1.2.2). Both claims can be proved by a generalization of H¨ormander’s
Theorem A.3.3, using the wave front set property (1.2.2) of both fk and gl and
the analogous property (2.2.7) of Hm. For details we refer to [23].
It remains to prove the associativity (b); this is more involved, we follow [165,
Sect. 6.2.4].
Proof. (Associativity of the ⋆-product) We will use the elegant way (2.1.7) of
writing the ⋆-product. The strategy of the proof is to trace back the associativity
of the ⋆-product to the associativity of the classical product M (2.1.8), which can
be written as
M ◦(id ⊗M) = M ◦(M ⊗id) : F⊗3 −→F .
(2.4.2)
Besides the diﬀerential operator DH : F⊗2 −→F⊗2 (2.1.7), we will work with the
related operators Dkl
H : F⊗3 −→F⊗3, 1 ≤k < l ≤3, which are deﬁned by

Existence and properties of the star product
59
By using associativity of the ⋆-product, an alternative, very simple proof of
the Jacobi identity for the Poisson bracket (part (ii) of Prop. 1.8.5) can be given.
Proof. (Jacobi identity for the Poisson bracket) Let F, G, H ∼ℏ0. Since the ⋆-
product is associative, its commutator
[F, G]⋆:= F ⋆G −G ⋆F
fulﬁlls the Jacobi identity:
[F, [G, H]⋆]⋆+ [H, [F, G]⋆]⋆+ [G, [H, F]⋆]⋆= 0 ;
(2.4.7)
this is obtained by writing out the 12 terms appearing in the Jacobi identity. From
property (d) of the ⋆-product we conclude
[F, [G, H]⋆]⋆= −ℏ2 {F, {G, H}} + O(ℏ3) .
(2.4.8)
Hence, the lowest non-vanishing order of the Jacobi identity for the ⋆-product is
the Jacobi identity for the Poisson bracket.
□
Lemma 2.4.1 (“Spacelike commutativity”). If (x −y)2 < 0 for all x ∈supp F and
y ∈supp G, then [F, G]⋆= 0 .
Proof. Notice that Hm(z) −Hm(−z) = i Δm(z) = 0 for z2 < 0; thus
n

l=1
Hm(xl −yl) −
n

l=1
Hm(yl −xl) = 0
if
(xl −yl)2 < 0 for each l.
The assertion follows by using (2.1.5).
□
Remark 2.4.2. Notice that the space F ≡F[[ℏ]] contains no reference to m, but
the algebra A(m) := (F, ⋆m) does indeed depend on m. Frequently, A(m) is called
the “algebra of observables”.
Furthermore, if O is any open region in Minkowski spacetime, and if F and G
belong to F(O) := { F ∈F


 supp F ⊂O }, then F ⋆G ∈F(O), too. This follows
directly from supp F := supp δF/δϕ(·) and the deﬁnition of the ⋆-product (2.1.5):
Writing the latter as F ⋆G := ∞
n=0
ℏn
n! ⟨F (n), H⊗nG(n)⟩, we obtain

is also an algebra: Everything may be localized to
the region O. And A(m)(O) is called the “algebra of observables localized in O”.

States
If the quantum observables are represented by linear operators on a Hilbert space
(as, e.g., in Schr¨odingers formulation of quantum mechanics or in a Fock space
description of QFT), one usually understands by a “state” a normalized vector of
this Hilbert space. Here we do not assume the existence of such a representation
and, hence, we generalize this deﬁnition of a state, by following the procedure in
Algebraic QFT [94] (cf. Sect. 3.7).
In Sects. 2.5 and 2.6 we somewhat change the framework: Instead of dealing
with formal power series in ℏ, we work with polynomials in ℏ. So we interpret the
star product as a map ⋆: Fℏ× Fℏ−→Fℏ(see (2.1.6)), where ℏ> 0 is a ﬁxed
parameter.
A state is a linear functional on the algebra of observables – for the model
of a real scalar ﬁeld this is the algebra (Fℏ, ⋆) – with certain properties; in detail
we deﬁne:
Deﬁnition 2.5.1 (State). A state ω on the algebra A ≡Aℏ:= (Fℏ, ⋆) is a map
ω :

A −→C
F −→ω(F) ≡ω(F)ℏ,
which itself may be a polynomial in ℏ, i.e., ω = S
s=0 ωs ℏs for some S < ∞, and
which is
(i) linear
ω(F + αG) = ω(F) + α ω(G) ,
∀F, G ∈A , α ∈C ,
(ii) real
ω(F ∗)ℏ= ω(F)ℏ,
∀F ∈A ,
∀ℏ> 0 ,
(iii) positive
ω(F ∗⋆F)ℏ≥0 ,
∀F ∈A ,
∀ℏ> 0 ,
(iv) normalized
ω(1) = 1 ,
(2.5.1)
where 1 ∈Fℏis the functional 1(h) = 1 ∀h ∈C.
In particular, if F ∗= F we have ω(F) ∈R. Linearity implies that
ω(F) ≡ω

(2.5.2)
So ω(F) ≡ω(F)ℏis a polynomial in ℏ. We point out that this is a true poly-
nomial, that is, the sum on the r.h.s. of (2.5.2) is an ordinary sum of complex
numbers. Trying to generalize Deﬁnition 2.5.1 to (F[[ℏ]], ⋆), the values ω(F) would
be elements of C[[ℏ]], that is, the sum on the r.h.s. of (2.5.2) would be a formal
sum; hence, the property (iii) would require an appropriate deﬁnition of positivity
in C[[ℏ]] or R[[ℏ]] – see Remk. 5.4.7. In this chapter – with regard to the Fock space
representation of the on-shell ﬁelds (treated in Sect. 2.6) – we do not follow this
path, however see (5.4.28).
A simple, but important, example is the vacuum state.

Deﬁnition 2.5.2 (Vacuum state). When quantizing with the Wightman two-point
function Δ+
m, the vacuum state ω0 : A −→C is deﬁned by setting ω0(F) := f0,
where F = f0 + 
n≥1⟨fn, ϕ⊗n⟩.
Clearly, ω0 is linear and normalized. Moreover, it is real: ω0(F ∗) = f0 =
ω0(F). The veriﬁcation of the positivity of ω0 is more involved, because in the sum
ω0(F ∗⋆F) = f0 f0 +

n≥1
ω0

⟨fn, ϕ⊗n⟩⋆⟨fn, ϕ⊗n⟩

there are in general non-vanishing contributions from the terms n ≥1. A sim-
ple proof of the positivity can be given by using the representation of A|CS0 in
Fock space, treated in the next section. Hence, we postpone this veriﬁcation to
Remk. 2.6.6.
We point out that ω0 is in general not positive, if we quantize with a Hada-
mard function:
ω0

ϕ(g)∗⋆Hμ
m ϕ(g)

= ℏ⟨g, Hμ
mg⟩
may be < 0
(where ϕ(g) :=

dx ϕ(x) g(x) for g ∈D(M)), as noted in (2.2.16). However, for
quantization with Δ+
m this problem does not appear, see (2.2.10).
Remark 2.5.3 (Coherent states). Instead of evaluation at ϕ = 0 (vacuum state),
we can also evaluate at ϕ = h, where h is a solution of the free ﬁeld equation:
h ∈CS0. This deﬁnes a “coherent state”:18
ωh :

A −→C
F −→ωh(F) := F(h)
for
h ∈CS0 .
(2.5.3)
Similarly to the vacuum state ω0, it is obvious that ωh is linear, normalized and
real; e.g.,
ωh(F ∗) = F ∗(h) =

n
⟨fn, h⊗n⟩=

n
⟨fn, h⊗n⟩= ωh(F) ,
since h is R-valued. Again, the proof of positivity is more diﬃcult and can be given
by means of the Fock space representation – see Remk. 2.6.6; it is this proof which
needs that h solves the free ﬁeld equation.

Vector states given by a Hilbert space representation. Let a nontrivial represen-

that a dense subspace D of H and a linear map

the relations

Moreover, we assume that the elements ψ ≡ψℏof D are polynomials in ℏ; Hilbert

Connection to the algebra of Wick polynomials
We now consider the connection of the star product algebra with the algebra of
Wick polynomials in Fock space (with the operator product). We assume that the
reader is familiar with the latter algebra. A short introduction to the Fock space
is given in App. A.5; to simplify the notation we write F (instead of F+) for the
bosonic Fock space.
Comparing on a heuristic level the algebraic structure of Wick polynomials
with the star product algebra, we observe the following.
(i) There is a crucial diﬀerence: The basic ﬁeld in Fock space obeys the free ﬁeld
equation: (□+ m2)ϕop(x) = 0; but our ﬁeld ϕ(x) is unrestricted.
(ii) The operator product in Fock space behaves as the star product: It is non-
commutative and associative.
(iii) Let F op, Gop be Wick polynomials integrated out with a test function. Ne-
glecting questions of domains of Fock space operators, the map F op −→F op ∗
(here, “∗” denotes the adjoint operator) corresponds to the ∗-operation in
(F, ⋆): Both are involutions (see App. A.1), in particular, (F op Gop)∗=
Gop ∗F op ∗corresponds to (F ⋆G)∗= G∗⋆F ∗.
(iv) The normally ordered product (A.5.21)–(A.5.22) behaves as the classical pro-
duct: It is commutative and associative.
The aim of this section is to make these observations precise.
To take into account the diﬀerence (i), we will work in the following with the
space of on-shell ﬁelds with respect to the free action S0,
F(m)
0
:= { F0 := F


CS0



 F ∈F } ,
(2.6.1)
where CS0 is the space of solutions of the free ﬁeld equation.
For F, G ∈F, we see that F0 = G0 if and only if each ﬁeld monomial in
(F −G) has a factor (□+ m2)ϕ(xj) for some 1 ≤j ≤n, that is, (F −G) lies in
J(m) :=

□x1 + m2
fn(x1, . . . , xn)



 fn ∈F′(Mn)

,
(2.6.2)
where F′(Mn) is given in Deﬁnition 1.2.1. In particular we use that fn is symmetric
in its arguments. Obviously, J(m) is an ideal (more precisely, a “2-sided ideal”) of
the algebra (F, · ), that is, J(m) is a subalgebra of (F, · ) satisfying F · J(m) =
J(m) = J(m) · F. We call J(m) the “ideal of the free ﬁeld equation”. Due to these
results, we can also describe the on-shell ﬁelds by using the quotient space F/J(m):

64
Chapter 2. Deformation Quantization of the Free Theory
The map19
Q :

F/J(m) −→F(m)

is an algebra isomorphism
(2.6.3)
with respect to the classical product on both sides:
Q

(F + J(m)) · (G + J(m))

= Q(FG + J(m)) = (FG)0 = F0 · G0
= Q(F + J(m)) · Q(G + J(m)) .
All these results remain true when we replace F, F(m)
0
and J(m) by F[[ℏ]], F(m)
0
[[ℏ]]
and J(m)[[ℏ]], respectively. Note that
F(m)

[[ℏ]] := {


Fn ℏn 


 Fn ∈F(m)

} = { F


CS0



 F ∈F[[ℏ]] } =: F[[ℏ]]


CS0 .
To introduce a star product on F(m)
0
[[ℏ]] ≃F[[ℏ]]/J(m)[[ℏ]]) , we must check
the following assertion.
Claim 2.6.1. If F ∈F[[ℏ]] and J ∈J(m)[[ℏ]], then J ⋆F ∈J(m)[[ℏ]] and F ⋆J ∈
J(m)[[ℏ]].
Proof. Any such J contains a factor (□+ m2)ϕ(xj), so that for the terms in J ⋆F
we get either
	
dxi · · ·
	
dy1 · · · (□xj + m2)ϕ(xj) · · ·
n

l=1
H(xl −yl)
δnF
δϕ(y1) · · · δϕ(yn)
which lies in J(m); or, if (□+ m2)ϕ(xj) is contracted,
	
dxi · · ·
	
dy1 · · · (□xj + m2)H(xj −yj)

l̸=j
H(xl −yl)
δnF
δϕ(y1) · · · δϕ(yn) ,
which vanishes, since (□xj + m2)H(xj −yj) = 0.
□
Remark 2.6.2. An immediate consequence of this claim is that J(m) is a Poisson
ideal of F (cf. [29, Proposition 8]); to wit,
F ∈F , J ∈J(m) =⇒{F, J} ∈J(m) ∧{J, F} ∈J(m) .
To see this, we recall that {F, J} = −{J, F} = limℏ→0(F ⋆J −J ⋆F)/iℏ.
19The deﬁnition of an “algebra isomorphism” is given in App. A.1.

2.6.
Connection to the algebra of Wick polynomials
65
Due to Claim 2.6.1, the star product on F[[ℏ]] induces a well-deﬁned product
on F(m)
0
[[ℏ]] ≃F[[ℏ]]/J(m)[[ℏ]], also denoted by ⋆: F(m)
0
[[ℏ]] × F(m)
0
[[ℏ]] →F(m)
0
[[ℏ]],
given by
F0⋆G0 := (F ⋆G)0
or
(F +J(m)[[ℏ]])⋆(G+J(m)[[ℏ]]) := (F ⋆G)+J(m)[[ℏ]] . (2.6.4)
So Q is an algebra isomorphism also with respect to the star product.
For the remainder of this section we restrict the ﬁelds to be polynomials in
ℏ, that is, we replace F[[ℏ]] by Fℏ(2.1.6). All equations are valid for all ℏ> 0, that
is, they hold individually to each order of ℏ.
The following theorem gives the connection of our description of “ﬁelds” as
functionals on the classical conﬁguration space with the conventional description
as Fock space operators.
Theorem 2.6.3 (Identiﬁcation of on-shell ﬁelds with Fock space operators, [51, 52]).
Let ϕop(x) be the free, real scalar ﬁeld (for a given mass m) on the Fock space F
and let F(m)
0,ℏ:= Fℏ


CS0. Then the map

isomorphism
F0 ⋆G0 −→Φ(F0 ⋆G0) = Φ(F0) Φ(G0)
for the star product on the left and the operator product on the right, which respects
the ∗-operation:

ψ1, Φ(F ∗

F =

Φ(F0)ψ1, ψ2

F
∀F0 ∈F(m)

(2.6.6)
and for all ψ1, ψ2 in the domain of Φ(F0) or Φ(F ∗
0 ), respectively. The same map
Φ also gives an algebra isomorphism
F0 · G0 −→Φ(F0 · G0) = :Φ(F0) Φ(G0):
with the classical product on the left and the normally ordered product on the right
(A.5.22).

66
Chapter 2. Deformation Quantization of the Free Theory
This theorem holds also for other kinds of ﬁelds and the pertinent Fock
spaces; in particular for the complex scalar ﬁeld (Example 1.3.2), gauge ﬁelds
(Sect. 5.1.3) and also for fermionic ﬁelds as, e.g., Dirac spinors (Sect. 5.1.1) and
Faddeev–Popov ghosts (Sect. 5.1.2). In Sect. 5.5 we will use this theorem for QED.
The proof relies on the observations
• that our deﬁnition of the classical product F0 · G0 on F(m)
0,ℏ(formula (1.2.6)
restricted to CS0) agrees under the bijection Φ with the deﬁnition of the
normally ordered product :Φ(F0) Φ(G0): (A.5.23),
• and that our deﬁnition of the star product on F(m)
0,ℏ(equations (2.1.5) and
(2.6.4)) agrees under the bijection Φ with the version of Wick’s Theorem
given in (A.5.33).
This theorem yields a faithful representation of the algebra A(m)
0
:= (F(m)
0,ℏ, ⋆m)
of on-shell ﬁelds – the “Fock space representation”. That is, the algebra A(m)
0
describes uniquely the algebra of smeared Wick products on Fock space.20

The r.h.s. is equal to

by applying Wick’s Theorem (A.5.33) we get exactly the same result as for the l.h.s..
Expectation values in states. Under this isomorphism, the state ω0 corresponds to
the Fock vacuum state ⟨Ω | · | Ω⟩(see (A.5.6) for the deﬁnition of Ω ∈F), that is,21

20In this way, we ﬁnesse the problem of having to worry about domains of operators on Fock
space; instead, we have to prove nontrivial statements about wave front sets, e.g., that, for
F, G ∈F, the product F ⋆G again fulﬁlls the wave front set property (1.2.2).
21Here and in the following we use the “bra-ket” notation , which is widespread in the physics
literature: Let F op be a linear operator on F, let φ ∈D(F op) ⊆F and ψ ∈F. Then we write
⟨ψ | F op | φ⟩:= ⟨ψ , F op φ⟩F .

In this approach, one usually considers the interaction as a perturbation of
the free theory. Consequently, physically relevant quantities, e.g., the S-matrix
or Green functions (i.e., vacuum expectation values of time-ordered products of
interacting ﬁelds), are power series in the coupling constant. For all physically
relevant models in four-dimensional relativistic QFT, the convergence of these
series is not under control – hence we understand them as formal power series.
Frequently, the formulas for the coeﬃcients of these power series are “derived”
• by proceeding in analogy to the interaction picture of quantum mechanics
(see, e.g., [109, Chap. 6-1] or Sect. 3.3.1);
• or from quantization by a path integral (also called “functional integral”),
that is, the generalization of the path integral of quantum mechanics to QFT,
see Sect. 3.9.5 and, e.g., [146] or [147] for the Euclidean theory.
We proceed in a diﬀerent way: Similarly to the original formulation of causal
perturbation theory (Epstein and Glaser [66]), we deﬁne pQFT by axioms; but in
contrast to the latter, we give axioms for the retarded product (i.e., the interacting
ﬁelds) and not for the time-ordered product, because we quantize the perturbative,
interacting, classical ﬁelds. (An additional diﬀerence to [66] is that we work in the
oﬀ-shell formalism: Our retarded product is a map from local oﬀ-shell ﬁelds to oﬀ-
shell ﬁelds, cf. Sect. 3.4.) Our axioms are motivated by the principle that we want
to maintain as much as possible from the structure of the perturbative expansion
of the classical retarded ﬁelds [54], worked out in Chap. 1.
From now on we will always use the Wightman two-point function for the
quantization. The modiﬁcations appearing when working with a Hadamard func-
tion are given in App. A.4.

3.1
Axioms for the retarded product
References for this section are the paper [55] and Steinmann’s ﬁrst book [155].
Recall that quantization, in the sense that we use the term here, means
replacement of the classical product by the star product (· →⋆) and the Poisson
bracket by the star-commutator bracket, {·, ·} →(iℏ)−1[·, ·]⋆ℏ, since we want to
retain as much as possible from classical ﬁeld theory.
What must we give up? First of all, the classical factorization (1.6.5), i.e.,
(AB)ret
S (x) = Aret
S (x) · Bret
S (x)
(3.1.1)
for A, B ∈Pbal and with interaction S, cannot continue to hold, neither for the
star product nor for the classical product on the r.h.s.; see the discussion about
composite interacting ﬁelds in App. A.7. Secondly, certain symmetries of classical
ﬁeld theory cannot be maintained: These are the anomalies of the corresponding
quantum ﬁeld theory.
For any F, S ∈Floc we wish to construct the interacting (retarded) ﬁeld23
FS corresponding to F, as a formal power series in the interaction S (i.e., in the
coupling constant κ), whose term of zeroth order is F. Compared with clFT, an
essential new feature is that these interacting ﬁelds are also formal power series
in ℏ, due to the quantization. Inspired by perturbative clFT, we make the Ansatz

(3.1.2)
the shorthand notation on the right side uses Linearity of the maps Rn,1, which
is the ﬁrst axiom in the list below. The convention with respect to the factors ℏ
is motivated by the fact that S/ℏ= κ ˜S/ℏis a dimensionless quantity. We shall
streamline the notation a little, now writing mostly F for F[[ℏ, κ]] and Floc for
Floc[[ℏ, κ]]. Formal series in both parameters should henceforth be understood.
The maps Rn,1 introduced in (3.1.2) form the retarded product R = (Rn,1)n∈N
(shortly “R-product”); sometimes we use the name “retarded product” also for
an individual Rn,1. To deﬁne the retarded product, we impose axioms, which are
motivated by their validity in classical ﬁeld theory.
We divide the axioms into “basic axioms” and “renormalization conditions”.
As we will see, the former determine the R-products

23We no longer write the superscript “ret” in the notation F ret
S , but it should still be understood,
and we omit the adjective “retarded”. Remember that S = κ ˜S.

Axioms for the retarded product

to renormalization, that is, up to coinciding points (i.e., up to xi = xj for some
i < j or xk = x for some k). The “renormalization conditions” restrict only the
process of renormalization, that is, the extension of the R-products to coinciding
points.
We use the following properties of the classical R-product as basic axioms
for the R-product of QFT:
• From Deﬁnition 1.7.1 we adopt Linearity and Symmetry (in the ﬁrst n en-
tries) of the maps Rn,1 : F⊗(n+1)
loc
−→F and the Initial condition R0,1(F) =
F. Besides these formal conditions,
• we require Causality (1.10.1) and the GLZ relation (1.10.3), which are pro-
found properties of the classical retarded products – and at least Causality
has a clear physical interpretation.
The solution of the basic axioms can be expressed by a closed formula, given in
(3.1.69), which is valid only for non-coinciding points.
As renormalization conditions we use
• important properties of the classical R-product, namely Field independence
(1.10.2), the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation (1.6.6) (or (1.7.7)) and the Scaling and
mass expansion; the latter expresses two diﬀerent properties of the R-pro-
ducts: “Smoothness in m ≥0 modulo log m” and “almost” homogeneous scal-
ing under (X, m) →(ρX, ρ−1m) (where X := (x1, . . . , xn, x)), see Sect. 3.1.5;
• symmetries of the classical R-product, namely Poincar´e covariance, ∗-struc-
ture and Field parity (see Exers. 1.10.4 and 1.10.5); in more complicated
models further symmetries of the classical R-product, such as conservation
of certain currents or gauge invariance belong also to the renormalization
conditions;
• and the condition that renormalization has to be done in each order of ℏ
individually; which is motivated by the requirement that the classical limit
exists and gives the classical R-product, see Sect. 3.1.6.
In the following Sects. 3.1.1–3.1.6 we work out the axioms and some direct conse-
quences.
3.1.1
Basic axioms
The ﬁrst axiom is
(a) Linearity: We require that
Rn,1 : F⊗(n+1)
loc
−→F
be linear.
Note that here both the arguments and the values of Rn,1 are oﬀ-shell ﬁelds.
The latter is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence to conventional formulations of pQFT, in

74
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
which the arguments and the values of the retarded or time-ordered products
are Fock space operators, i.e., on-shell ﬁelds (see Sect. 2.6).
The fact that the retarded products depend only on (local) functionals F, but
not on how they are written as smeared ﬁeld polynomials, F =

dx g(x) A(x),
implies the Action Ward Identity (AWI), which is the relation ∂xR

· · · A(x) · · ·

=
R

· · · (∂A)(x) · · ·

for A ∈P. To explain this, we ﬁrst deﬁne, for balanced ﬁelds
B1, . . . , Bn, B in Pbal, the F-valued distribution Rn,1

B1(x1)⊗· · ·⊗Bn(xn), B(x)

∈D′(Mn+1, F) by
	
dx1 · · · dxn dx Rn,1

B1(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗Bn(xn), B(x)

g1(x1) · · · gn(xn) g(x)
:= Rn,1

B1(g1) ⊗· · · ⊗Bn(gn), B(g)

,
∀g1, . . . , gn, g ∈D(M) ;
(3.1.3)
this deﬁnition is motivated by the classical relation (1.7.4). Since the R-products
depend only on (local) functionals, the r.h.s. of (3.1.3) is well deﬁned. Next, for
arbitrary ﬁeld polynomials A1, . . . , An, A ∈P, we deﬁne the analogous F-valued
distributions Rn,1

A1(x1) ⊗· · ·⊗An(xn), A(x)

by ﬁrst writing Ai = 
ai ∂aiBiai
where Biai ∈Pbal and setting

.
Here is where we make essential use of the uniqueness of the expressions of arbi-
trary ﬁelds Ai in terms of balanced ﬁelds Biai, guaranteed by Proposition 1.4.3.
The deﬁnition (3.1.4) implies the Action Ward Identity, which is due to
Raymond Stora [159, 160] and [55],24
AWI:

(3.1.5)

,
∀A ∈P , 1 ≤l ≤n + 1 .
A further simple consequence of these deﬁnitions is that formula (3.1.3) actually
holds for all B1, . . . , Bn, B ∈P (instead of only for B1, . . . , Bn, B ∈Pbal): Namely,
24Actually, for A ∈Pbal, the AWI (3.1.5) is a particular case of the deﬁnition (3.1.4) and for an
arbitrary A = 
a ∂aBa ∈P it can be obtained by using (3.1.4) twice:

Since we interpret Rn−1,1 sometimes as a map Rn−1,1 : F⊗n

times as a map
Rn−1,1 :



,
(3.1.7)
we shall often call it an “operation”, and similarly for Jn−2,2 and R0
n−1,1 introduced
far below in (3.1.12) and in Prop. 3.2.2, respectively.
Remark 3.1.1. In this remark, we only assume that for a Lagrangian g(x)L(x) and
a local ﬁeld given by g1(x)A(x), where g, g1 ∈D(M) and L, A ∈P, the pertinent
R-product of order (n, 1) is obtained by
	
dx1 · · · dxn dx g(x1) · · · g(xn) g1(x) Rn,1

L(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗L(xn), A(x)

.
With this, the AWI is not only necessary, it is also suﬃcient for the dependence
of the R-product only on (local) functionals F. Namely, writing F as
F =
	
dx g(x) A(x) =
	
dx

g(x) A(x) + (∂g1)(x) A1(x) + g1(x) (∂A1)(x)

for an arbitrary pair (g1, A1) ∈D(M) × P, this property of the R-product is
equivalent to the relation
	
dx

(∂g1)(x) R

· · · A1(x) · · ·

+ g1(x) R

· · · (∂A1)(x) · · ·

= 0 ,
∀g1, A1 ,
which is an equivalent reformulation of the AWI.
The motivation for the AWI and the reason for the name “Action Ward
Identity” is that physics depends only on the (inter)action S, and not on the
choice of a corresponding Lagrangian g(x)L(x).
Our inductive construction of the retarded product (given in Sect. 3.2) is
a direct construction of Rn,1

A1(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗An(xn), A(x)

(for all A1, . . . , An ∈
P , n ∈N); the retarded product as a sequence of maps Rn,1 : F⊗(n+1)
loc
−→F is
then obtained by (3.1.6). In this construction, the AWI (3.1.5) plays the role of
an additional axiom; as it will turn out, it is a renormalization condition, i.e., it
belongs to the axioms treated in Sects. 3.1.4–3.1.6.

Remark 3.1.2. If the entries F of the retarded products would be on-shell ﬁelds
F0 (2.6.1) (as this is the case when working in Fock space) and if Rn,1 would be
linear as required by condition (a), then the AWI could not hold true, because
there would be a contradiction to the ﬁeld equation (1.7.7):

CS0 is not the free action S0. For the relation between R-products
deﬁned for on-shell ﬁelds and R-products deﬁned for oﬀ-shell ﬁelds, see Sect. 3.4
and [161].
Remark 3.1.3. The main diﬀerence between our formalism and that of Stein-
mann [155] is that Steinmann works only in the adiabatic limit, i.e., he always sets
g1(x) := · · · gn(x) := g(x) := 1 for all x, in (3.1.3) – or more precisely in the cor-
responding formula for B1, . . . , Bn, B ∈P. Hence, to avoid infrared divergences,
he assumes m > 0. In our formalism this assumption is not needed; the adiabatic
switching by g1, . . . , g ∈D(M) ensures IR-ﬁniteness. This adiabatic switching is a
main ingredient of causal perturbation theory (also called “Epstein–Glaser renor-
malization”).

(3.1.10)
for all A1, . . . , An, A ∈P, that is, all xj must lie in the past of x; see the
right-hand part of Figure 3.1.
Using the Linearity and Symmetry axioms, the equivalence of (3.1.9) and (3.1.10)
can be shown as follows.

see (3.1.8). Now if one of the xj, say xn, does not lie in x + V −, then (3.1.9)
implies that the right-hand side may be modiﬁed as follows: In the argument of
Rn,1 the sum n
j=1 λjAj(xj) may be reduced to n−1
j=1 λjAj(xj) and with that
the derivative ∂/∂λn vanishes.
For (3.1.10) =⇒(3.1.9): Let S = A1(g1), H = A2(g2) and F = A(g), with
A1, A2, A ∈P and g1, g2, g ∈D(M); and let also supp g2 ∩(supp g + V −) = ∅.

Remark 3.1.6 (Spacelike commutativity of interacting ﬁelds). Analogously to the

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side certainly exists: Δm(z) θ(z0) = Δret
m (z); but
the second only exists for x −y ̸= 0, so this second term requires renormalization,
which is the extension of r0 ∈D′(R4 \ {0}) to r ∈D′(R4).
Deﬁnition 3.1.7 (Extension). An extension of a distribution r0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}),

for all f ∈D(Rk \ {0}).
Due to the GLZ relation, the skew-symmetric part of r is already determined
by r(z)−r(−z) = Δ+
m(z)2 −Δ+
m(−z)2, so we only need to extend the symmetrized
distribution
s0(z) := 1
2
#
r0(z) + r0(−z)
$
∈D′(R4 \ {0}).
Such an extension is non-unique: Given one extension s(z), one can also use
s(z) +

|a| even
Ca ∂aδ(z),
with arbitrary constants
Ca ∈C ;
cf. Theorem (A.1.17). For that reason, we shall need to add (later on) appropriate
renormalization conditions to delimit the possible constants Ca that may appear.
To study the classical limit we require that the relation s0(z) ∼ℏ0 is main-
tained under renormalization, that is, s(z) ∼ℏ0, which is a restriction of the
constants Ca. This implies r(z) ∼ℏ0. With that and with the interaction S :=

(3.1.14)
since the second term in (3.1.13) drops out on setting ℏ→0. By Rcl we mean the
classical retarded product, as deﬁned in Chap. 1; the second equality sign results
from (1.9.3).
3.1.3
Discussion of the GLZ relation
The l.h.s. of the GLZ relation (3.1.11a) is the commutator of two interacting ﬁelds,
whose coeﬃcients in the perturbative expansion are the ﬁelds Jn−2,2(· · · ) (3.1.12).
In this section we derive some basic properties of the operations Jn−2,2, which will
be crucial for the inductive construction of the retarded product (Rn,1)n∈N – see
Sect. 3.2.1.
In this section and later, we shall often write tensor products with commas,
for instance:
Rn−1,1(G1, . . . , Gn−1; F) ≡Rn−1,1(G1 ⊗· · · ⊗Gn−1, F),
where the left-hand side can also be regarded as a multilinear function of n vari-
ables.

3.1.
Axioms for the retarded product

Assuming that the Rk,1 have been constructed for k = 0, 1, . . ., n −2, the
functional
Jn−2,2(F1, . . . , Fn−2; F, G) := 1
iℏ

I⊆{1,...,n−2}
#
R|I|,1(FI, F), R|Ic|,1(FIc, G)
$
⋆ℏ
(3.1.15)
can be built. It is clear from the right-hand side that Jn−2,2 is symmetric in the
ﬁrst (n −2) factors:
Jn−2,2(Fπ(1), . . . , Fπ(n−2); F, G) = Jn−2,2(F1, . . . , Fn−2; F, G) ,
∀π ∈Sn−2 ;
and skew-symmetric in the last two factors:
Jn−2,2(F1, . . . , Fn−2; G, F) = −Jn−2,2(F1, . . . , Fn−2; F, G).
The GLZ relation (3.1.11b) and the causality axiom (3.1.10) – both stipulated
for the as yet unknown Rn−1,1 operation – require that Jn−2,2 have the following
additional two properties. Firstly, on combining the GLZ relation
ℏJn−2,2

A1(x1), . . . , An−2(xn−2); A(y), B(z)

= Rn−1,1

A1(x1), . . . , An−2(xn−2), A(y); B(z)

−Rn−1,1

A1(x1), . . . , An−2(xn−2), B(z); A(y)

with the causality requirement on Rn−1,1, we get
supp Jn−2,2 ⊂Jn
where
Jn :=

(x1, . . . , xn−2, y, z)



{x1, . . . , xn−2, y} ⊂(z + V −)
or
{x1, . . . , xn−2, z} ⊂(y + V −)

(3.1.16)
which in turn implies that (y −z)2 ≥0 in both cases:
z
y
x1
•

y

Secondly, a further necessary condition for the GLZ relation (3.1.11b) is:
Jn−2,2(F1, . . . , Fn−3, H; F, G) + Jn−2,2(F1, . . . , Fn−3, G; H, F)
+ Jn−2,2(F1, . . . , Fn−3, F; G, H)

Rn−1,1(F1, . . . , Fn−3, H, F; G) −Rn−1,1(F1, . . . , Fn−3, H, G; F)

+ Rn−1,1(F1, . . . , Fn−3, F, G; H) −Rn−1,1(F1, . . . , Fn−3, F, H; G)

= 0,
since Rn−1,1 is symmetric in its ﬁrst (n −1) factors.

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
These two necessary conditions are indeed satisﬁed, as the next lemma shows.
Lemma 3.1.8 (Properties of Jn−2,2, [55, 155]). Let operations Rk,1, for k = 0, 1, . . .
. . . , n−2, be given, satisfying the basic axioms (a) to (e) above. Then the operation
Jn−2,2 deﬁned by (3.1.15) fulﬁlls both the Jacobi identity
Jn−2,2(F1, . . . , Fn−3, H; F, G) + cyclic(H, F, G) = 0
(3.1.17)
and the support property supp Jn−2,2 ⊂Jn (3.1.16).
Proof. Jacobi identity: we proceed by induction on n and start with the Jacobi
identity of the commutator [ · , · ] ≡[ · , · ]⋆ℏand use again the notation FI :=
⊗i∈IFi, where I ⊂{1, . . . , n −3}. So we know

I⊔M⊔L={1,...,n−3}
#
[R(FI; H), R(FM; F)], R(FL; G)
$
+ cyclic(H, F, G) = 0 ,
(3.1.18)
where ⊔means the disjoint union. Let K := I ⊔M be ﬁxed. Summing the inner
commutator over all decompositions of K into I⊔M, we obtain iℏJ|K|,2(FK; H, F),
where |K| ≤n −3, which splits into i

R(FK, H; F) −R(FK, F; H)

due to the
validity of the GLZ relation to lower orders. With that we obtain
0 =

K⊔L={1,...,n−3}


, R(FL; G)
$
+ cycl(H, F, G)
= iℏJn−2,2(F1, . . . , Fn−3, H; F, G) + cyclic(H, F, G) .
In the last equality sign we use that

K⊔L={1,...,n−3}
#
R(FK, H; F), R(FL; G)
$
−
#
R(FK, H; G), R(FL; F)

$
= iℏJn−2,2(F1, . . . , Fn−3, H; F, G) .
Support property: for simplicity we write xl for Al(xl) and similarly y for A(y),
z for B(z). By deﬁnition of J (3.1.12) and the support properties of R it follows
that Jn−2,2(x1, . . . , xn−2; y, z) vanishes if one of the ﬁrst n −2 arguments is not
in {y, z} + V −.
It remains to show that it vanishes also for (y −z)2 < 0. If one of the ﬁrst
n −2 arguments, e.g., x1, is diﬀerent from y and z, and is in {y, z} + V −, then J
vanishes due to the Jacobi identity:
J(. . . , x1; y, z) = −J(. . . , z; x1, y) −J(. . . , y; z, x1) = 0 ,
because z ̸∈{x1, y} + V −and y ̸∈{z, x1} + V −.

3.1.
Axioms for the retarded product
83
If, on the other hand, all arguments xi are suﬃciently near to either y or z,
then they are space-like to the other point. Hence, by Causality of the R-products
of lower orders, all pairs of retarded products in the deﬁnition of J vanish up to
one:
J(x1, . . . , xn−2; y, z) = 1

where K is that subset of {1, . . . , n−2} for which xk ≈y ∀k ∈K and xj ≈z ∀j ∈
Kc := {1, . . ., n −2} \ K. By induction we know that the two retarded products
fulﬁll the axiom (f) “Field independence” (given below) and, hence, the support
property (3.1.21). Therefore, Lemma 2.4.1 can be applied: The commutator in
(3.1.19) vanishes.
□
3.1.4
Further axioms: Renormalization conditions
As we shall see later on (in Sect. 3.2.1), in the inductive step Rn−2,1 →Rn−1,1
the basic axioms determine Rn−1,1

A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)

uniquely on D(Mn \Δn),
where Δn is the thin diagonal (A.1.12). The further axioms restrict only the ex-
tension to D(Mn) (which is called “renormalization”) and, hence, are named “re-
normalization conditions”. Similarly to the basic axioms, they are motivated by
their validity in classical ﬁeld theory. (Except for the last one, which is motivated
by the classical limit.)
First, we require that the maps Rn−1,1 have no intrinsic dependence on the
ﬁelds.

In clFT Field independence relies on δΔret/δϕ = 0, see (1.10.2). The “unrenor-
malized” R-product, given by (3.1.13) or generally by formula (3.1.69), contains
also the propagator Δ+. Since also δΔ+/δϕ = 0, axiom (f) is reasonable.
By using (1.3.19) and Linearity (axiom (a)), we ﬁnd a nice consequence of
Field independence:

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
We are now going to derive a very important and useful application of Field
independence, which will turn out to be an equivalent reformulation of this axiom.
A retarded product Rn−1,1

A1(x1), . . . ; An(xn)

is an F-valued distribution. Since
(ordinary) C-valued distributions are much more handy to work with, we are
looking for a Taylor expansion of Rn−1,1(. . .) in ϕ; the coeﬃcients in this series
are then the wanted C-valued distributions. By means of Field independence, the
latter can be expressed as vacuum expectation values of (in general) other R-
products, as we will see.
As a preparation we remark that the deﬁning formula (1.2.1) for a ﬁeld,
F ∋F =
N

n=0
	
dx1 · · · dxn ϕ(x1) · · · ϕ(xn) fn(x1, . . . , xn) ,


δnF
δϕ(x1) · · · δϕ(xn)

according to (1.3.1). Hence, formula (3.1.22) can be interpreted as a (ﬁnite) Taylor
expansion in ϕ with respect to ϕ = 0. Applying this to Rn−1,1(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn) and
using the Field independence (3.1.20), we get

(3.1.23)
One veriﬁes (rather laboriously) that (3.1.23) provides a solution to (3.1.20); and
so, the relations (3.1.20) and (3.1.23) are equivalent.
Remark 3.1.9. The expansion (3.1.23) is essentially the causal Wick expansion of
Epstein and Glaser [66], see (3.1.24) below. For that, note that
supp

δϕ(xk1) · · · δϕ(xkl) ⊆Δl .
Explicitly: Letting Fk =

dxk hk(xk) Ak(xk) with Ak ∈P a ﬁeld monomial and
hk ∈D(M), we integrate out the ∂aδ(xk1 −xk, . . . , xkl −xk) distributions com-
ing from the functional derivative of Ak(xk), cf. (1.3.19). Removing the test func-
tions hk, we thereby arrive at the aforesaid causal Wick expansion: For monomials

The name “causal Wick expansion” is due to the fact that (3.1.24) is the
“Wick expansion” (given below in (3.1.28)) for a product – the R-product – sat-
isfying a causality relation.
We illustrate the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24) by a simple exercise.

the retarded products as required by axiom (h) below. More precisely, we will
see that this axiom implies that the distributions ω0(Rn−1,1(. . .)) (3.1.27) depend
only on the relative coordinates and, hence, we may apply (1.2.9).
In turn, this result implies that the right-hand side of (3.1.24) exists. This
corresponds to the famous Theorem 0 of Epstein and Glaser [66, Sect. 4] for causal
perturbation theory in Fock space, which is originally due to Bogoliubov and
Shirkov [12]. They say, in essence, that “the pointwise product of distributions

1 (x1) . . . Aop
n (xn): exists on D(Rdn) for arbitrary
fn ∈D′(Rd(n−1)) and A1, . . . , An ∈P, because the ﬁrst factor depends only on

Axioms for the retarded product
87
(b) We prove this equation by a straightforward computation of the l.h.s.: Starting with
(2.1.5), we take into account (2.1.2). Then we apply the Field independence (3.1.20) and
(1.3.19) and ﬁnally the AWI (3.1.5).]
The next supplementary axioms are the following.
(g) ∗-structure and Field parity.
• ∗-structure: This axiom reads26
Rn−1,1(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn)∗= Rn−1,1(F ∗
1 ⊗· · · ⊗F ∗
n) .
(3.1.29)
If, as is usual, S∗= S, then this takes the form R(eS
⊗, F)∗= R(eS
⊗, F ∗).
For the classical retarded products, the validity of (3.1.29) relies on Δret
m (x) =
Δret
m (x), as shown in Exercise 1.10.4. However, in QFT there appears also the prop-
agator Δ+
m, which has a diﬀerent behaviour: Δ+
m(x) = Δ+
m(−x). So we motivate
the ∗-structure axiom by the following exercise.
Exercise 3.1.12. Assume that Rk,1 satisﬁes the basic axioms for 0 ≤k ≤n −1 and the ∗-
structure axiom for 0 ≤k ≤n −2. Prove that Rn−1,1(⊗n−1
l=1 Gl, H) fulﬁlls the ∗-structure
axiom if supp Gr ∩(supp H + V +) = ∅for some r ∈{1, . . . , n −1}.
[Solution: Due to the axiom Symmetry we may assume that it is Gn−1 which has the
mentioned support property with respect to H. Writing F := Gn−1, the GLZ relation
and Causality yield

(g) • Field parity: The Field parity axiom is the condition that the relation
(1.10.7) for classical R-products holds also true for the R-products of pQFT:
α ◦Rn−1,1 = Rn−1,1 ◦α⊗n .
(3.1.30)
To make the relevance of this axiom more transparent, we give equivalent refor-
mulations. For this purpose we introduce, for a ﬁeld monomial A, the order |A| of
A in ϕ: For
A = c
L

l=1
∂alϕ
(where c ∈C)
we deﬁne
|A| := L ;

this can equivalently be written as

the Field parity axiom (3.1.33), it is also suﬃcient; this follows by means of the
causal Wick expansion (3.1.24) and |Aj| + |Aj| = |Aj|.
For the “unrenormalized” retarded product Runrenorm, introduced below in

(βΛ,aF) ⋆(βΛ,aG) = βΛ,a(F ⋆G)

βΛ,a ◦RS(x) = RβΛ,aS(Λx + a) ◦βΛ,a

3.1.5
The scaling and mass expansion
References for this section are [64, 101] and to some extent [55].
Mostly, the literature about causal perturbation theory (e.g., [24, 66, 148])
works with a condition for the scaling behaviour of the retarded products which
concerns only the UV-region, that is, the asymptotic scaling behaviour of the

92
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
distributions r(A1, . . . , An)(y) (3.1.41) (where y := (x1 −xn, . . .)) for y →0 –
this is the “Scaling degree axiom” treated in Sect. 3.2.5. In view of the techniques
to renormalize in practice explained in Sect. 3.5, we prefer to work with a clearly
stronger version of this axiom, which takes into account that the classical retarded
product R(m)
n−1,1 (Def. 1.7.1) behaves homogeneously under the scaling (X, m) →
(ρX, ρ−1m), ∀X := (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Mn, ∀m ≥0 and ∀ρ > 0 (where m denotes the
mass of the retarded propagator, which is also the mass of the star product ⋆m).
This property cannot be maintained under quantization, but we may require that
it is “almost” maintained (i.e., up to powers of log ρ). In addition, since we want to
work with distributions having good properties under scaling in X only, we require
that the distributions r(m)(A1, . . . , An) (3.1.41) can be expanded with respect to
m in a “Taylor series modulo log m”; with this, the ﬁrst requirement amounts to
the condition that the coeﬃcients of this series are “almost” homogeneous (i.e.,
homogeneous up to logarithmic terms) with respect to X →ρX.
Almost homogeneous scaling, mass dimension and scaling of ﬁelds. To work this
idea out, we need some mathematical notions about scaling of distributions and
ﬁelds.
Deﬁnition 3.1.17 ((Almost) homogeneous scaling). We say that a distribution t in
D′(Rk) or in D′(Rk \ {0}) scales almost homogeneously with degree D ∈C and
power N ∈N if and only if 28
(Ek + D)N+1t(z1, . . . , zk) = 0
and
(3.1.46a)
(Ek + D)Nt(z1, . . . , zk) ̸= 0 ;
(3.1.46b)
where Ek := k
r=1 zr ∂/∂zr is the Euler operator.
When N = 0, we say there is homogeneous scaling of degree D.
According to our deﬁnition, t(z) = z−D logN(z) is almost homogeneous with
degree D and power N. The reason for the somewhat strange terminology with
respect to the sign of D is that the scaling degree (introduced in Deﬁnition 3.2.5)
of a distribution fulﬁlling (3.1.46a) is deﬁned to be D rather than (−D).29
As we explain below, the relation (3.1.46a) holds if and only if
0 = (ρ ∂ρ)N+1
ρD t(ρz1, . . . , ρzk)

=
∂N+1
∂(log ρ)N+1

ρD t(ρz1, . . . , ρzk)

∀ρ > 0 ;
(3.1.47)
and both parts of (3.1.46) hold if and only if ρD t(ρz1, . . . , ρzk) is a polynomial
in log ρ, of degree N.
28The relations (3.1.46) have to be understood in the sense of distributions, that is, f(z) = 0
if and only if

dz f(z) g(z) = 0 ∀g ∈D(Rk[\{0}]). In this section and later we shall write
“D(Rk[\{0}])” for “D(Rk) or D(Rk \ {0})”, and likewise for D′(Rk[\{0}]).
29Other names appear in the literature: Distributions which scale almost homogeneously with
degree D and power N are also called “associate homogeneous of scaling degree (−D) and scaling
order N” in [80, 131] or “log-homogeneous with bidegree (−D, N)” in [86].

To wit, computing the (N + 1)th derivative in (3.1.47) at ρ = 1 we obtain
(3.1.46a). That (3.1.46a) (or (3.1.47) at ρ = 1) is also suﬃcient for (3.1.47) can
be seen as follows:

To deﬁne a scaling transformation on the ﬁeld space F, we need the notion
of the “mass dimension” (also called “scaling dimension”) of a monomial A ∈P.
Deﬁnition 3.1.18 (Mass dimension). The mass dimension of ∂aϕ ∈P is deﬁned
by
dim ∂aϕ := d −2
2
+ |a|
for
a ∈Nd .
For monomials A1, A2 ∈P, we agree that dim(A1A2) := dim A1 + dim A2.
Denote by Pj the vector space spanned by all monomials A ∈P with
dim A = j. Write Phom := &
j∈N Pj (union, not direct sum) to denote the set
of “homogeneous” polynomials, in this sense.
Remark 3.1.19. In practice, a way to determine the mass dimension of a basic
ﬁeld φ, e.g., a complex scalar ﬁeld or a Dirac spinor ﬁeld, is the following: Using
that each monomial in the Lagrangian L0 of the free theory has mass dimension
d, where one sets dim ml := l, and taking into account the relations dim ∂aφ =
dim ∂aφ∗= dim φ+|a| and the formula dim A1A2 = dim A1 +dim A2, one obtains
the value of dim φ.
Now, the scaling of ﬁelds is deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 3.1.20 (Scaling transformation). The scaling transformation σρ, for ρ >
0, is deﬁned on the basic ﬁeld ϕ(x) by
σρ

ϕ(x)

:= ρ−dim ϕϕ(ρ−1x) .
(3.1.48)
For general ﬁelds, σρ : F −→F is given by

everything else unchanged”.

One easily veriﬁes the following properties:
• σρ is an algebra isomorphism of (F, ·); in particular,
σρ(F1 · F2) = σρ(F1) · σρ(F2) ;
(3.1.49)
• the inverse σ−1
ρ
is given by σ−1
ρ

• For A ∈P we deﬁne σρ(A(x)) by  dx g(x) σρ(A(x)) := σρ
 dx g(x) A(x)

for all g ∈D(M). This gives the frequently used relation
ρdim A σρ(A(ρx)) = A(x) ,
∀A ∈Phom .
(3.1.50)
• ω0 ◦σρ = ω0 , a trivial but useful remark.
For m > 0 the physically relevant scaling is a simultaneous scaling of X := (x1, . . .)
and m: (X, m) →(ρX, ρ−1m). The Wightman two-point function Δ+
m behaves
homogeneously under that, as already noted in (2.2.9). In the next exercise we
verify that this entails
σρ(F1 ⋆m/ρ · · · ⋆m/ρ Fn) = σρF1 ⋆m · · · ⋆m σρFn .
(3.1.51)
For m = 0, this relation simpliﬁes to
σρ(σ−1
ρ F1 ⋆0 · · · ⋆0 σ−1
ρ Fn) = F1 ⋆0 · · · ⋆0 Fn ,
(3.1.52)

[Solution: (a) Formula (3.1.53) is obtained straightforwardly by combining Deﬁnitions
1.3.1 and 3.1.20 of the functional derivative and of σρ, respectively. Computing
σρ(F1 ⋆m/ρ F2) by means of the deﬁnition of the star product (2.1.5) and using (3.1.53)

by induction on n and by taking into account the associativity of the star product.

Since Rcl is translation invariant (see Exer. 3.1.15), we may proceed similarly
to (3.1.41): We deﬁne r(m)
cl
(A1, . . . , An)(x1 −xn, . . .) to be the vacuum expectation
value of the r.h.s. of (3.1.56). Using ω0 ◦σρ = ω0 and σ−1

dim Al ∈N ,
for all A1, . . . , An ∈Phom. The restriction to Phom is necessary in order that dim Al
is well deﬁned.
That D is a natural number can be seen as follows: Let A1, . . . , An be mono-
mials. Now, rcl(A1, . . . An) is non-vanishing only if 
l |Al| is even; this follows
from Field parity, similarly to (3.1.34). From that and from
dim Al = |Al| · 1
2(d −2) + [number of derivatives in Al] ,
we conclude that D ∈N.
The information contained in (3.1.56) is completely encoded in (3.1.57), for
the following reason: Due to linearity of Rcl it suﬃces to consider monomials
A1, . . . , An. Now, Rcl satisﬁes Field independence (1.10.2) and, hence, the causal
Wick expansion (3.1.24). By the latter Rcl

A1, . . . , An

is uniquely given in terms

(3.1.59)
As we have already seen in the example treated in Sect. 3.1.2, the main prob-
lem in pQFT is renormalization, i.e., the extension of distributions u0 ∈D′(Rk \
{0}) to u ∈D′(Rk). If u0 scales almost homogeneously under Rk ∋X →ρX, there
exists an extension which maintains almost homogeneous scaling (Prop. 3.2.16 in
Sect. 3.2.2) and a lot is known about the uniqueness and the construction of such
an extension. However, in the scaling property (3.1.57) the mass is also scaled.
In view of these facts, we are looking for a reformulation of (3.1.57) in terms of
distributions which scale homogeneously under X := (x1 −xn, . . .) →ρX only,
instead of (X, m) →(ρX, ρ−1m). This can be done as follows: First we recall that
m −→Δret
m (g) is smooth in m ≥0, for each g ∈D(Rd). By (1.9.8), this implies
that R(m)
cl (F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn) is smooth in m ≥0 for all F1, . . . , Fn ∈Floc; and hence
this holds also for m −→r(m)
cl
(A1, . . . , An)(g) for all g ∈D(Rd(n−1)) and for all
A1, . . . , An ∈P; where we assume that F1, . . . , Fn or A1, . . . , An, respectively, do
not depend on m. Therefore, the following Taylor expansion is possible: For all
l, L ∈N, there exist distributions ul, r(m)
L+1 ∈D′(Rd(n−1)) such that
r(m)
cl
(A1, . . . , An)(X) =
L

where X := (x1 −xn, . . . , xn−1 −xn), and the following properties hold:
(a) The distributions ul(X) are independent of m and u0 = r(m=0)

Axioms for the retarded product

If A1, . . . , An are monomials, the scaling behaviour (3.1.57) of r(m)
cl
(A1, . . . , An)
translates into the following properties:
(c) The distributions ul(X) scale homogeneously in X with degree D −l;
(d) and the remainders r(m)
L+1(X) are homogeneous with degree D under the scal-
ing (X, m) →(ρX, m/ρ), i.e., they fulﬁll (3.1.57).
The scaling and mass expansion: An axiom for pQFT. Trying to preserve this
structure (i.e., the expansion (3.1.60) with the properties (a)–(d)) in the quanti-
zation, the following crucial complications appear:
• For even dimensions d, the Wightman two-point function Δ+
m(z) is not
smooth in m at m = 0, due to the term m2 f(m2z2) log

−m2
4 (z2 −iz00)

in
(2.2.3). Therefore, the Taylor expansion (3.1.60) has to be generalized to an
expansion of the form
r(m)(A1, . . . , An)(X) =


p=0
logp m
M

ul,p(X)+r(m)
L+1(X) , L, Pl ∈N ,
where M > 0 is a ﬁxed mass scale.
• In general a homogeneous behaviour under X →ρX cannot be maintained
in the renormalization; this is the “scaling anomaly” (also called “dilatation
anomaly”). However, one can reach that the breaking of this symmetry is
“weak”, in the sense that the breaking term is ∼log ρ. Or more general, if
u0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) scales almost homogeneously with degree D and power
N, it may happen that there is no extension u ∈D′(Rk) which scales also
with D and N, but then there exists an extension which scales with D and
(N + 1), see Proposition 3.2.16.
To give an example let us study the distribution r0 appearing in (3.1.13)
in the massless case: r0(z) :=

D+(z)2−D+(−z)2
θ(z0) ∈D′(R4\{0}) scales
homogeneously with degree 4. The best that exists is an extension r ∈D′(R4)
which scales almost homogeneously with degree 4 and power 1, see (3.2.119).
Therefore, in the properties (c) and (d) above, we have to replace “ho-
mogeneous scaling” by “almost homogeneous scaling”.
These facts and thoughts motivate the following axiom.
(k) Scaling and mass expansion: For all ﬁeld monomials A1, . . . , An ∈P which

Axioms for the retarded product
99
The name “scaling and mass expansion” refers to the following two possibil-
ities to interpret (3.1.62)–(3.1.63): On the one hand it is an expansion in terms of
m-independent, almost homogeneously scaling distributions ul,p and on the other
hand it is a “Taylor expansion in the mass m modulo log m”.
Remark 3.1.23. For a massless model, i.e., for m = 0, the Sm-expansion axiom
obviously reduces to the condition that the distributions r(A1, . . . , An) (3.1.61)
scale almost homogeneously with degree D := n
l=1 dim Al for all monomials
A1, . . . , An ∈P.
Exercise 3.1.24. In d = 4 dimensions verify that the Wightman two-point function Δ+

fulﬁlls the Sm-expansion with degree D = 2, by using (2.2.3).

Example 3.1.25 (Sm-expansion axiom for r(ϕ, ϕ) in d ≥3 dimensions). For arbitrary
d ≥3, Δ+ (d)
m
fulﬁlls the Sm-expansion with degree D = d −2. (If d is odd, Δ+ (d)
m
is
smooth in m ≥0, hence the Sm-expansion is simply the Taylor expansion.) Proceeding
analogously to the example in Sect. 3.1.2, we obtain

2 , the axiom (k) is satisﬁed.
The following lemma gives basic properties of distributions fulﬁlling the Sm-
expansion.
Lemma 3.1.26. If f (m) ≡f (m)
1
∈D′(Rk[\{0}]) and f (m)
2
∈D′(Rq[\{0}]) satisfy
the Sm-expansion with degree D ≡D1 or D2, respectively, then the following
statements hold true:

1
+ βf (m)
2
, (α, β)
∈C2 arbitrary, fulﬁlls also the Sm-expansion with degree D1.
(1) f (m) is smooth in m for m > 0 and limm↓0 f (m) = u0 = f (m=0) .
(2) f (m)(X) is almost homogeneous with degree D under the scaling
(X, m) →(ρX, m/ρ).
(3) ∂a
X f (m)(X) (where a ∈Nk) fulﬁlls the Sm-expansion with degree D + |a|.
(4) We assume that the product of distributions f (m)
1
(X1)f (m)
2
(X2), which may
be a (partly) pointwise product30, exists. Then, f (m)
1
(X1) f (m)
2
(X2) fulﬁlls also
the Sm-expansion with degree (D1 + D2).
(5) The Sm-expansion is unique, i.e., if we know that a given f (m) has such an
expansion, then the “coeﬃcients” u(m)
l
(and, hence, also the “remainders”
r(m)
L+1) are uniquely determined.
(6) The scaling behaviour for X →0 of the remainder r(m)
L+1(X) is bounded by
lim
ρ↓0 ρD−(L+1)+ε r(m)
L+1(ρX) = 0
∀ε > 0 ;
or, in terms of the scaling degree introduced later in Deﬁnition 3.2.5:
sd(r(m)
L+1) ≤D −(L + 1).
Proof. Part (0) is obvious.
Part (1) follows immediately from (3.1.62) and properties (a), (b) and (e).
Part (2): We have to show that ml u(m)
l
(X) has the asserted scaling property.
This can be done by using (3.1.46a):
(X ∂X + D −m ∂m)N ml u(m)

operators (X ∂X + D −l)k or (−m ∂m)N−k yields zero when applied to u(m)
l

due to properties (c) and (b), respectively.
Part (3): We show that ∂a

(X) and ∂a
Xr(m)
L+1(X) satisfy the properties
(a)–(e) with degree D + |a|. To verify (d) let N ∈N be such that (X ∂X + D −

L+1(X) = 0. It follows that
0 = ∂a

L+1(X) = (X ∂X + D + |a| −m ∂m)N ∂a

30More precisely: Let X1 = (x1, . . . , xk) ∈Rk and X2 = (xk+1, . . . , xk+q) ∈Rq, respectively.
Then, the set {x1, . . . , xk+q} may be linearly dependent.

(c) can be shown analogously. To verify (a),(b) and (e) we use that these properties
hold for ⟨g(m), h⟩, where g(m) = u(m)
l
or g(m) = r(m)
L+1, for all h ∈D(Rk[\{0}]).
Hence, they hold also for (−1)|a| ⟨g(m), ∂ah⟩= ⟨∂ag(m), h⟩∀h.

From part (1) of the lemma and linearity of R(m)
n−1,1, we see that the axiom
(k) implies continuity of the functions 0 ≤m −→r(m)(A1, . . . , An)(g) for all
g ∈D(Rd(n−1)) and for all A1, . . . , An ∈P. Due to the causal Wick expansion
(3.1.24), this continuity holds also for 0 ≤m −→R(m)(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn) for all
F1, . . . , Fn ∈Floc.
Because of part (2) of the lemma, the Sm-expansion axiom implies that the
distributions r(m)(A1, . . . , An)(X) (3.1.61) are almost homogeneous with degree
D := 
l dim Al under (X, m) →(ρX, ρ−1m), for all monomials A1, . . . , An. Pro-
ceeding similarly to (3.1.59), we use the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24) to obtain

for some N < ∞. Or in other words: The ρ-dependence of the left-hand side of
(3.1.67) is a polynomial in log ρ. This relation gives the scaling behaviour of the
retarded product. For m = 0 it is a property of R(m=0), since in that case we have
R(m=0) on both sides of (3.1.67); but for m > 0 it relates retarded products for
diﬀerent masses.
Comparing with the scaling behaviour of the star product, given in (3.1.51)
and (3.1.52), we see that, for the retarded product, this relation can only be
maintained up to powers of log ρ.
Summarizing roughly, the Sm-expansion axiom requires two diﬀerent prop-
erties for the retarded product: “Smoothness in m ≥0 modulo log m” and almost
homogeneous scaling under (X, m) →(ρX, ρ−1m).
3.1.6
The classical limit
An important additional reference for this section is [51].
Since we describe classical and quantum ﬁelds by the same space F of func-
tionals, the requirement that “the limit ℏ→0 of an interacting ﬁeld of pQFT gives
the corresponding classical, interacting ﬁeld” makes directly sense. To fulﬁll this
condition, we need to control the number of factors ℏappearing in an R-product.
We start with the “unrenormalized” R-product: Let
ˇMn+1 := { (x1, . . . , xn, x) ∈Mn+1 

 x ̸= xl ̸= xj ̸= x ∀1 ≤l < j ≤n } .
(3.1.68)
On D( ˇMn+1) there is a closed formula for the retarded product Rn,1, which is
obtained from the classical formula (1.9.5) by the replacement {·, ·} →i−1[·, ·]⋆ℏ:31

This iterated, retarded commutator gives the “unrenormalized” retarded product
(analogously to the “unrenormalized” time-ordered product, which results from
the Feynman rules, see Remks. 3.3.3 and 3.3.4).
The commutators are taken with respect to the star product; hence, each
commutator gives at least one factor of ℏ. We conclude that (3.1.69) is of order
O(ℏn) if A1, . . . , An, A ∼ℏ0.
Our ﬁnal renormalization condition ensures that this property be maintained
in the extension to coinciding points:32
31In contrast to (2.0.1), the commutator does not get a factor ℏ−1 here, as can be seen from the
GLZ relation (3.1.11a).
32The extension to partial diagonals (e.g., x1 = x2 with x3, . . . , xn, x arbitrary) is the renorma-
lization of “subdiagrams”, which is accomplished in earlier steps of the inductive construction of
the retarded products.

104
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
(l) ℏ-dependence: Renormalization is done in each order of ℏindividually and,
proceeding this way, 0 ∈D′(Mn+1\Δn+1, F) is extended by 0 ∈D′(Mn+1, F).
For later purpose we give an equivalent reformulation of this axiom: Using the
notation (3.1.31), the condition is that for all monomials A1, . . . , An+1 it holds
that33
rn,1(A1, . . . , An+1) ∼ℏ
n+1
j=1 |Aj|/2
if
A1, . . . , An+1 ∼ℏ0 .
(3.1.70)
Due to the ﬁeld parity axiom (3.1.34) solely integer powers of ℏappear. The equi-
valence of the condition (3.1.70) to the axiom (l) is due to the fact that the va-
cuum expectation value of the “unrenormalized” retarded product (3.1.69) fulﬁlls
the condition (3.1.70) (because each term contributing to this vacuum expecta-
tion value has n+1
j=1 |Aj|/2 contractions and each contraction gives precisely one
factor ℏ).
From this axiom we conclude that
Rn,1(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn, F) = O(ℏn)
if
F1, . . . , Fn, F ∼ℏ0.
Thus, if S, F ∼ℏ0, then limℏ→0 R(eS/ℏ
⊗, F) exists. This limit fulﬁlls the classical
version of the axioms (i.e., the axioms for ℏ→0). These have a unique solu-
tion, namely Rcl(eS
⊗, F). This will follow immediately from the construction of the
retarded products given in Sect. 3.2.
Summing up, the classical limit exists and gives the classical retarded pro-
duct:
lim
ℏ→0 R(eS/ℏ
⊗, F) = Rcl(eS
⊗, F)
if
S, F ∼ℏ0 .
(3.1.71)
For an illustration, see (3.1.14).
3.1.7
(Feynman) diagrams
In Sect. 1.9 we have seen that a classical Rn,1-product can be understood as the
sum over all connected tree diagrams, and that each inner line stands for a propa-
gator Δret. For a Rn,1-product of pQFT the following three complications appear:
(i) also loop diagrams34 contribute and (ii) there are two kind of propagators,
Δret and Δ+, being symbolized by the inner lines. Finally (iii), if diﬀerent dia-
grams (that is, diﬀerent contraction schemes) contribute to the same coeﬃcient
r(A1, . . . , An) in the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24), it is unclear to which diagram
a ﬁnite renormalization term of r(A1, . . . , An) (i.e., a local term being undeter-
mined in the extension of r(A1, . . . , An) from D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}) to D′(Rd(n−1)))
belongs.
33We use the convention that 0 ∈D′(Rdn) satisﬁes: 0 ∼ℏr ∀r ∈R, r > 0.
34A (Feynman) diagram that is not a tree diagram (see Footn. 12) is called a “loop diagram”.
That is, the deﬁning criterion for a loop diagram is that it contains at least one closed line. A
loop diagram may be connected or disconnected.

Axioms for the retarded product
105
To explain what we understand by a (Feynman) diagram for a Rn,1-product
of pQFT, we start with the formula for the unrenormalized Rn,1-product (3.1.69),
in which solely the propagator Δ+ appears. Writing each commutator in (3.1.69)
as [A, B] = A ⋆B −B ⋆A, we get n! · 2n terms, where the symmetrization in
(x1, . . . , xn) is also taken into account. For example, for x ̸= x1 ̸= x2 ̸= x we
obtain

diﬀer by the orientation of the inner lines35 (due to Δ+(z) ̸= Δ+(−z)) and by
the time-ordering of all vertices (given by the θ-functions). However, to reduce the
number of diagrams, we represent these eight terms by one diagram, which has
only the time-ordering x0

the diagram given in Figure 3.2.

written out in (3.1.72).
Generally speaking, by a (Feynman) diagram we symbolize a contraction
scheme for the unrenormalized Rn,1-product, that is, for the iterated, retarded
and symmetrized commutator (3.1.69). Such a diagram has only the time-ordering

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
a simple example is the ﬁrst diagram in Sect. 3.1.2, an example belonging to a
loop diagram appears in the second last line of (3.1.72).
We are now going to prove two basic properties of the diagrams belonging to
a retarded product.
Claim 3.1.27. Only connected diagrams contribute to the unrenormalized retarded
product (3.1.69).
Proof. Considering the causal Wick expansion for Rn,1(A1, . . . , A) (3.1.24), the
appearing contraction schemes are encoded in the vacuum expectation values
rn,1(A1, . . . , A) (3.1.41) (where A1, . . . , A are monomials and Al ⊆Al, A ⊆A);
they are visualized by vacuum diagrams, i.e., diagrams without external legs. Let
us assume that a disconnected vacuum diagram contributes. By Translation co-
variance, it depends only on the variables (xj −xi) with xj and xi in the same
connected component (where xi stands also for the ﬁeld vertex x). Hence, the sup-
ports of diﬀerent connected components can be translated relatively to each other
without changing the analytic expression. Therefore, the terms corresponding to
such a diagram would violate the causality axiom.
□
Claim 3.1.28. Let L, A ∈P with L, A ∼ℏ0. On D( ˇMn+1) (3.1.68) the classical
R-product Rcl n,1

⊗n
j=1L(xj), A(x)

is precisely the contribution of all (connected)
tree diagrams to Rn,1

⊗n
j=1L(xj)/ℏ, A(x)

(given by (3.1.69)). This statement is
valid also for the renormalized R-product (i.e., on D(Mn+1)).
Proof. On D( ˇMn+1): The diagrams belonging to Rn,1

⊗n
j=1L(xj)/ℏ, A(x)

have n
interaction vertices, each having a factor ℏ−1; and one ﬁeld vertex, which is ∼ℏ0.
Each inner line has a factor ℏ, due to the deﬁnition of the ⋆-product (2.1.5). Since
all diagrams are connected, each diagram has at least n inner lines. The connected
tree diagrams are precisely the connected diagrams with n inner lines. Counting
the factors of ℏfor each diagram contributing to Rn,1

⊗n
j=1L(xj)/ℏ, A(x)

, we
conclude that the limit ℏ→0, which gives Rcl n,1

⊗n
j=1L(xj), A(x)

(3.1.71),
selects precisely all connected diagrams with n inner lines, i.e., all connected tree
diagrams.
To prove the validity of the Claim on D(Mn+1), ﬁrst note that the contribu-
tion of any (connected) tree diagram is well deﬁned on D(Mn+1), since it is given
by tensor products of distributions (pointwise products of distributions do not
appear) – renormalization concerns only loop diagrams. Hence, Rtree n,1 = Rcl n,1
holds also on D(Mn+1) and, under renormalization, the relation
Runrenorm = Rcl + Runrenorm
loop
goes over into
R = Rcl + Rrenormalized
loop
.
□
A simple illustration for the argumentation in this Proof is the example in
Sect. 3.1.2.
Taking into account the Feynman rules for Rcl, given after Exer. 1.9.3, we
obtain the following statement for any connected tree diagram contributing to the

⊗n


: The pertinent n! · 2n terms
of the iterated, retarded commutator (3.1.69) can be summarized by one term in
which all propagators are Δret-distributions, by using the relation (3.1.73). Having
done this, all θ(y0 −z0) (where y, z ∈{x, x1, . . . , xn}) appearing in (3.1.69) have
vanished or can be omitted, since there is an implicit chain-like time-ordering of
the vertices along each branch of the tree, due supp Δret ⊆V +. See Exap. 1.9.2.
3.2
Construction of the retarded product
We continue to follow Steinmann [155] and the papers [55, 64].
To construct the general solution (Rn,1)n∈N of the axioms, we proceed by
induction on n. Axiom (c) gives the initial value: R0,1(F) = F. The inductive step
is done in two substeps:
• First the construction of Rn−1,1

A1(x1), . . . ; An(xn)

, A1, . . . , An ∈P, oﬀ
the thin diagonal Δn (A.1.12), i.e., on D(Mn \ Δn). This part is uniquely
determined by the basic axioms.
• Then the extension to Δn, i.e., to a distribution in D′(Mn, F). This sec-
ond part is non-unique, but it is strongly restricted by the renormalization
conditions.
3.2.1
Inductive step, oﬀthe thin diagonal Δn
Let Rl,1, for l = 0, 1, . . . , n −2, be constructed already such that they satisfy all
axioms (a)–(l) – this is the inductive assumption which is made in the following
two propositions. Now construct the functionals
Jn−2,2

A1(x1), . . . , An−2(xn−2); An−1(xn−1), An(xn)

according to the recipe (3.1.15).
Proposition 3.2.1 (Uniqueness, [55, 155]). If some operation Rn−1,1 fulﬁlling the
basic axioms exists, then
(a) it is uniquely determined on D(Mn \ Δn); and
(b) if the extension of the totally symmetric part

operation Rn−1,1 is completely determined (see Footn. 27 for the notation).

108
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
As a consequence of this proposition, two solutions of the basic axioms for
the operation Rn−1,1 evaluated at (A1(x1), . . . ; An(xn)) diﬀer by an element of
D′(Mn, F), which has support on Δn and is invariant under permutations of the
pairs (A1, x1), . . . , (An, xn).
Proof. Ad (a):
Consider the following open subsets of Mn:
M0 := { (x1, . . . , xn)


 ∃j ∈{1, . . . , n −1} with xj /∈(xn + V −) },
Mk := { (x1, . . . , xn)


 xk /∈(xn + V +) },
for
k = 1, . . . , n −1.
(3.2.2)
First we check that {M0, M1, . . . , Mn−1} is an open cover (i.e., a cover by open
sets) of Mn \ Δn, that is,
n−1

k=0
Mk = Mn \ Δn .
(Figure 3.3 illustrates the case n = 2.) The relation &
k Mk ⊆Mn \ Δn is obvious.
To prove “⊇”, let x := (x1, . . . , xn) /∈Δn. Then there exists a j ∈{1, . . . , n −1}
with xj ̸= xn. If xj /∈(xn + V −) we have x ∈M0; and if xj /∈(xn + V +) we have
x ∈Mj.
Now we are going to show that Rn−1,1

A1(x1), . . . ; An(xn)

is uniquely de-
termined on each Mk, 0 ≤k ≤n −1: For (x1, . . . , xn) ∈M0, we get, due to
causality (3.1.10):
Rn−1,1

A1(x1), . . . ; An(xn)

= 0.
(3.2.3a)
For (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Mk with k > 0, causality gives
Rn−1,1

A1(x1), . . . , 
Ak(xk), . . . , An(xn); Ak(xk)

= 0.
The GLZ relation then implies that

Note that in the second and third line the contributions coming from k = n
cancel. We conclude: Once Sn(A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)) is extended from D(Mn \ Δn)
to D(Mn), the distribution Rn−1,1(A1(x1), . . . ; An(xn)) ∈D′(Mn, F) is completely
determined.
□
Proposition 3.2.2 (Existence, [55, 155]). Under the inductive assumption, there
exists an operation
R0
n−1,1 : P⊗n −→D′(Mn \ Δn, F) ,
fulﬁlling all the aforesaid axioms, i.e., the basic axioms and all renormalization
conditions.
Proof. First we check that the partial recipes (3.2.3) for Rn−1,1 on the several Mk
coincide on the overlaps Mk ∩Ml, for 0 ≤k < l ≤n −1. Then, by the sheaf
theorem on distributions, these assemble to give a well-deﬁned operation R0
n−1,1
on the union Mn\Δn. This compatibility check uses the support property of Jn−2,2
and the Jacobi identity given in Lemma 3.1.8.
In detail: First let (x1, . . . , xn) ∈M0 ∩Ml. Due to (3.2.3a) and (3.2.3b)
we have to show that36 J(. . . ; xl, xn) = 0. If (. . . , xl, xn) ∈supp Jn−2,2 ⊆Jn
(3.1.16), we conclude from xl /∈(xn + V +) that {x1, . . . , xn−1} ⊂(xn + V −),
which contradicts (x1, . . . , xn) ∈M0.
Now let (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Mk ∩Ml. Then we have to show that
Jn−2,2(. . . , xl; xk, xn) = Jn−2,2(. . . , xk; xl, xn) .
By the Jacobi identity the left minus the right side of this equation is equal to
Jn−2,2(. . . , xn; xk, xl), which vanishes since xn is neither in the past of xk nor xl.
It remains to verify the axioms for R0
n−1,1:
36To simplify the notations we write xr for Ar(xr) in the arguments of R0
n−1,1 and Jn−2,2.

110
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
• Causality follows from (3.2.3a).
• Symmetry is obvious from the construction.
• To verify the GLZ relation, we have to show that
R0
n−1,1(. . . , x, y; z) −R0
n−1,1(. . . , x, z; y) = ℏJn−2,2(. . . , x; y, z)
(3.2.5)
holds whenever (x, y, z) /∈Δ3. If y ̸= z, then y ̸∈z + V + or y ̸∈z + V −. In
the latter case we have (. . . , x, y, z) ∈M0 and (. . . , x, z, y) ∈Mn−1, hence
R0(. . . , x, y; z) = 0 and
R0(. . . , x, z; y) = ℏJn−2,2(. . . , x; z, y) = −ℏJn−2,2(. . . , x; y, z) .
The case y ̸∈z + V + is analogous.
So it remains to treat the case when y is arbitrary close to z and x ̸=
y ∧x ̸= z, i.e., when x ̸∈(y + V ϵ ∪z + V ϵ′) for some pair (ε, ε′), where ϵ, ϵ′ ∈
{+, −}. In the case ϵ = ϵ′ = −, all terms in (3.2.5) vanish (by construction of
R◦
n−1,1 and due to the support property of J). In the case ϵ = −and ϵ′ = +,
we analogously ﬁnd R◦(. . . , x, z; y) = 0 and J(. . . , z; x, y) = 0. Hence, by the
Jacobi identity the assertion (3.2.5) becomes R◦(. . . , x, y; z) = ℏJ(. . . , y; x, z)
which is the construction (3.2.3b) of R◦
n−1,1(. . . , x, y; z) since (. . . , x, y, z) ∈
Mn−2. The case ϵ = + and ϵ′ = −is analogous. Finally, for ϵ = ϵ′ = + we
have R◦(. . . , x, y; z) = ℏJ(. . . , y; x, z) and R◦(. . . , x, z; y) = ℏJ(. . . , z; x, y)
by means of (3.2.3b). The assertion (3.2.5) follows then by the Jacobi identity.
• The renormalization conditions (axioms (f)–(l) and the AWI) go over from
R0,1, . . . , Rn−2,1 to Jn−2,2 via (3.1.15). Due to (3.2.3), they hold also for
R0
n−1,1. This can be veriﬁed straightforwardly; only the Sm-expansion axiom
is more involved.
To prove the latter, we have to show that
jn−2,2(A1, . . . ; An−1, An)(x1 −xn, . . . ) = 1

Δj=n := { (x1, . . . , xn)

One easily veriﬁes that on each D(Δc

the R0
n−1,1

There are a few cases in which the product of distributions on the r.h.s. of

3.2.2
The extension to the thin diagonal Δn
As in the inductive Epstein–Glaser construction of time-ordered products [24, 66,
158] (explained shortly in Sect. 3.3), the extension to Δn corresponds to what is
called “renormalization” in conventional approaches. For this reason, this exten-
sion is named “Epstein–Glaser renormalization” (or only “renormalization”).
Due to Proposition 3.2.1, we need only extend the symmetric part Sn given
by (3.2.1). More precisely, if S denotes the operation of symmetrization, it is
necessary to extend S0
n := SR0
n−1,1 from D′(Mn \ Δn, F) to D′(Mn, F).

3.2.
Construction of the retarded product

By the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24), the operations H = R0
n−1,1, Rn−1,1,
S0
n, Sn are uniquely determined by their respective vacuum expectation values

H

A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)

, (3.2.20)
for A1, . . . , An ∈P, which are translation-invariant numerical distributions. The
task, then, is to extend s0(A1, . . . , An) ∈D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}) to a distribution
s(A1, . . . , An) in D′(Rd(n−1)).
Scaling degree. The existence and uniqueness of solutions of the just given task
can be described in terms of Steinmann’s scaling degree of s0 ≡s0(A1, . . . , An)
[24, 155], which – heuristically speaking – is a measure for the strength of the
singularity of s0(x) at x = 0.
Deﬁnition 3.2.5. The scaling degree (with respect to the origin) of a distribution
t ∈D′(Rk) or t ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) is given by38
sd(t) := inf{ r ∈R


 lim
ρ↓0 ρr t(ρx) = 0 } ,
where inf ∅:= ∞and inf R := −∞.
If t scales homogeneously, with degree D ∈C, then sd(t) = Re D. Note that
this holds also when t merely scales almost homogeneously with degree D, since
then ρD t(ρx) is a polynomial in log ρ.
Example 3.2.6. If δ(k) denotes the Dirac delta supported at the origin of Rk and a ∈Nk,
then39
sd

∂aδ(k)(x)

= k + |a|,
since
∂aδ(k)(ρx) = ρ−k−|a| ∂aδ(k)(x).
If t ∈D′(Rk) with 0 ̸∈supp t, then sd(t) = −∞, because for each g ∈D(Rk)
there exist a ρg > 0 such that supp t(ρ · ) ∩supp g = ∅for all 0 < ρ < ρg.
For t ∈D′(Rk), the relation sd(t) < ∞always holds; but for t ∈D′(Rk \{0})
the value sd(t) = ∞is possible, a one-dimensional example is t(x) = θ(x) e1/x,
since
lim
ρ↓0 ρr
	 ∞
0
dx e1/(ρx) h(x)
diverges
∀r ∈R
and for a suitable h ∈D(R\{0}) – details are worked out in the following exercise.
37The convention implicitly adopted here is that each VEV is denoted by a lowercase letter when
the operation is given by the corresponding uppercase letter. We will use this convention also
when the arguments are elements of Floc, explicitly:
h(F1, . . . , Fn) := ω0
	
H(F1, . . . , Fn)

∀F1, . . . , Fn ∈Floc .
38The deﬁning condition for the set { · · · } has to be understood in the sense of distributions:
limρ↓0 ρr  dkx t(ρx) g(x) = 0 for all g ∈D(Rk[\{0}]).
39One could write δ(k) instead; but this risks confusion with the standard notation for the kth
derivative of the one-dimensional δ.

(b) Compute the scaling degree
(i) of a continuous function f : Rk −→C with f(0) ̸= 0, considered as an element
of D′(Rk);
(ii) of the Wightman two-point function Δ+
m (2.2.1) and of the Feynman propa-
gator ΔF
m (2.3.8) in d dimensions.
(c) Prove the following basic properties of the scaling degree for a ∈Nk:
(iii) sd(∂at) ≤sd(t) + |a| ;
(iv) sd(xa t) ≤sd(t) −|a| ;
(v) sd(t1 ⊗t2) = sd(t1) + sd(t2), where ⊗denotes the tensor product of distribu-
tions.
The properties (iii) and (iv) are precise formulations of the well-known heuristic
statements that “in general diﬀerentiation increases the strength of the singulari-
ties” and that “multiplication with xa makes the distribution less singular at x = 0”.
For example, for f ∈D′(R), given by
f(x) :=

x
for
x ≥0
0
for
x < 0 ,
we obtain
sd(f) = −1 ,
sd(f ′) = sd(θ) = 0 ,
and sd(f (2+k)) = sd(δ(k)) = 1 + k (k ∈N).

for all h ∈D(Rk) and for all ε > 0. This proves the assertions.
(v) Proof of sd(t1 ⊗t2) ≤sd(t1) + sd(t2): It suﬃces to consider test functions of the
form h(x1, x2) = h1(x1) h2(x2) with h1, h2 ∈D(Rk). The assertion follows from the
factorization
⟨(t1 ⊗t2)(ρx1, ρx2), h1(x1)h2(x2)⟩(x1,x2) = ⟨t1(ρx1), h1(x1)⟩x1 · ⟨t2(ρx2), h2(x2)⟩x2 .

3.2.
Construction of the retarded product
117
Proof of sd(t1 ⊗t2) ≥sd(t1) + sd(t2): Given ε > 0, there exist h1, h2 ∈D(Rk) such that
ρsd(tj)−ε/2 ⟨tj(ρxj), hj(xj)⟩xj diverges for ρ ↓0, where j = 1, 2. Hence, this holds also for
ρsd(t1)+sd(t2)−ε ⟨(t1 ⊗t2)(ρx1, ρx2), h1(x1)h2(x2)⟩(x1,x2).]
Existence and uniqueness of extension. From the deﬁnition of the scaling degree,
it follows immediately that any extension t ∈D′(Rk) of a given t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0})
obeys sd(t) ≥sd(t0). We are looking for extensions which do not increase the scal-
ing degree. The following fundamental theorem is taken from [24], the proof given
there relies on earlier work of Epstein and Glaser [66] and of H¨ormander [107].
Techniques which are similar or related to the ones of this theorem and of Propo-
sition 3.2.16 have been developed also in the older work of G¨uttinger and Rieck-
ers [90, 91].
Theorem 3.2.8. Let t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}). Then:
(a) If sd(t0) < k, there is a unique extension t ∈D′(Rk) fulﬁlling the condition
sd(t) = sd(t0).
(b) If k ≤sd(t0) < ∞, there are several extensions t ∈D′(Rk) satisfying the
condition sd(t) = sd(t0). In this case, given a particular solution t0, the
general solution is of the form
t = t0 +

with
Ca ∈C.
(3.2.21)
In case (b), the addition of a term 
a Ca ∂aδ(k) is called a “ﬁnite renorma-
lization”.
Outline of the proof. (See also [73].)
Ad (a):
Let χ ∈C∞(Rk) be such that 0 ≤χ(x) ≤1, χ(x) = 0 for |x| ≤1
and χ(x) = 1 for |x| ≥2.

If h ∈D(Rk), then χρh: x −→χ(ρx)h(x) lies in D(Rk \ {0}) for any ρ > 0, hence
⟨t0, χρh⟩exists. For h1 ∈D(Rk \ {0}) it holds that χρh1 = h1 for ρ suﬃciently
large. Therefore, assuming that the limit
⟨t, h⟩:= lim
ρ→∞⟨t0, χρh⟩
∀h ∈D(Rk) ,
(3.2.22)
exists and deﬁnes a distribution t ∈D′(Rk), this t is an extension of t0. These
assumptions can indeed be proved. In addition one shows that sd(t) = sd(t0).
We call (3.2.22) the direct extension of t0. Independence of χ follows from the
uniqueness.

118
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
For that uniqueness, let t1 and t2 be extensions of t0 with the same scaling
degree. Then supp(t1 −t2) ⊆{0}, so that t1 −t2 = 
a Ca ∂aδ(k) for some coeﬃ-
cients Ca (Theorem (A.1.17)). However, since sd(t1 −t2) ≤max{sd(t1), sd(t2)} =
sd(t0) < k, whereas sd(∂aδ(k)) = k + |a|, we see that Ca = 0 for all a.
Ad (b): General solution (3.2.21). Again, two solutions t1 and t2 diﬀer by
t1 −t2 = 
a Ca ∂aδ(k) for some Ca ∈C. However, now we have sd(t1 −t2) ≤
sd(t0) ≥k. Hence, we obtain Ca = 0 only for |a| > sd(t0) −k.
Existence of t: Let ω := sd(t0) −k be the singular order 40 of t0. Note that ω
need not be an integer; let ⌊ω⌋be its integer part. Introduce the subspace of test
functions
Dω := Dω(Rk) := { h ∈D(Rk)


 ∂ah(0) = 0 for |a| ≤⌊ω⌋} .
(3.2.23)
This subspace clearly includes D(Rk \ {0}).
Claim 3.2.9. t0 has a unique extension tω to D′
ω satisfying sd(tω) = sd(t0).
[[Proof of the claim: Any h ∈Dω can be written as
h(x) =

|a|=⌊ω⌋+1
xaga(x)
with
ga ∈D(Rk) .
(3.2.24)
This decomposition of h is non-unique in general, however, we will see that this
does not matter. Then we can deﬁne
⟨tω, h⟩:=

|a|=⌊ω⌋+1
⟨xat0, ga⟩,
(3.2.25)
where the overline denotes the direct extension of xat0, which is guaranteed by
part (a), since sd(xat0) ≤sd(t0) −(⌊ω⌋+ 1) < k. Inserting (3.2.22) we obtain
⟨tω, h⟩= lim

ρ→∞⟨t0, χρ

|a|=⌊ω⌋+1
xaga⟩= lim
ρ→∞⟨t0, χρh⟩,
(3.2.26)
from which we see that the deﬁnition of tω ∈D′
ω (3.2.25) is independent of the
choice of the decomposition (3.2.24). Due to the similarity of (3.2.26) and (3.2.22),
we call tω the “direct extension of t0 to D′
ω.”
Uniqueness of tω follows from the fact that 
|a|≤ω Ca ∂aδ(k) vanishes on Dω.]]
Each projector W : D(Rk) −→Dω – by which is meant a linear, continuous
and idempotent map with41 range Dω – deﬁnes an extension tW ∈D′(Rk) (called
“W-extension”) by
⟨tW , h⟩:= ⟨tω, Wh⟩,
(3.2.27)
40This is the same as the power-counting degree in momentum space.
41Since Dω has ﬁnite codimension in D(Rk), such continuous projectors exist, but are not unique.

3.2.
Construction of the retarded product
119
where the right-hand pairing denotes duality on Dω. Since Wh = h for h ∈
D(Rk \ {0}), the relations
⟨tW , h⟩= ⟨tω, Wh⟩= ⟨tω, h⟩= ⟨t0, h⟩
show that tW is indeed an extension of t0.
It is somewhat harder to prove that sd(tW ) = sd(t0) for any such W; we omit
this.
Any set of functions wa ∈D(Rk), one for each a ∈Nk such that |a| ≤⌊ω⌋,
satisfying
∂bwa(0) = δb

(Kronecker delta, not Dirac!) deﬁnes such a projector W by42
Wh(x) := h(x) −

|a|≤⌊ω⌋
∂ah(0) wa(x).
(3.2.29)
Except for the continuity this can easily be veriﬁed: Since ∂b(Wh)(0) = 0 ∀|b| ≤
⌊ω⌋and ∀h ∈D(Rk), we have Ran W ⊆Dω; taking additionally into account
Wh1 = h1 ∀h1 ∈Dω, we conclude W 2 = W and also Dω ⊆Ran W.
For the functions wa one can, for instance, take
wa(x) := xa
a! w(x)
(|a| ≤⌊ω⌋)
(3.2.30)
where w ∈D(Rk) satisﬁes w(0) = 1 and ∂bw(0) = 0 ∀1 ≤|b| ≤⌊ω⌋.
□
Example 3.2.10 (Exer. 3.2.4 continued). The distribution r0 := r0
2,1(ϕ2, ϕ2, ϕ2) ∈D′(R8 \
{0}), computed in Exer. 3.2.4, has sd(r0) = 6 < 8. Therefore, we are in case (a) of
the theorem and the direct extension (3.2.22) applies. In this sense, one writes for the
extension r ∈D′(R8) the same explicit expression (3.2.19) as for r0. Although the result
(3.2.19) involves a pointwise product of distributions (which is equivalent to the observa-
tion that the corresponding diagram contains a loop), this result is well deﬁned in D′(R8)
by the direct extension.
Example 3.2.11. 43 Let
t0(x) := θ(x) x−l ∈D′(R \ {0}),
l = 1, 2, . . .
Obviously sd(t0) = l, ω = l −1 and h ∈D(R) lies in Dω if and only if ∂ah(0) = 0 for all
0 ≤a ≤l −1. Let w(x) be as in (3.2.30) and let W be the pertinent projector (3.2.29).
Writing any h ∈D(R) as
h(x) = W h(x) +

42Actually, there are circumstances under which not all wa need to be test functions: See the ex-

Central solution. If all ﬁelds are massive, the infrared behavior of t0 is harmless
and, for the existence of (3.2.27), it is not necessary that Wh(x) decays as |x| →∞.

Theorem 3.2.8 holds also for the extension from S′(Rk \ {0}) to S′(Rk), hence
we may use Fourier transformation. In [66] it is proved that in the massive case
the Fourier transformation '
tW (p) of the W-extension (3.2.27) is analytic in a
neighbourhood of p = 0; hence, this holds for any extension (3.2.21). Relying on
this result, Epstein–Glaser deﬁne the central solution tc by the conditions
sd(tc) = sd(t0)
and
∂a
p tc(0) = 0
∀|a| ≤sd(t0) −k ≡ω ,
(3.2.32)
which determines tc uniquely, due to part (b) of Theorem 3.2.8.
To show the equivalence of the x- and p-space deﬁnitions of tc, we verify that
tc := tω ◦W1 (3.2.31) fulﬁlls (3.2.32). sd(tc) = sd(t0) can be shown analogously to
sd(tW ) = sd(t0) (we have omitted this in the above sketch proof of Theorem 3.2.8);
to check the second condition in (3.2.32) we proceed as follows. Due to analyticity
of ˆtc(p) in a neighbourhood of p = 0, we may use ∂aδ(p) as “test function”: For
|a| ≤ω we obtain
⟨ˆtc, ∂aδ⟩p = ⟨tc, 
∂aδ⟩x = (−i)|a|
(2π)k/2 ⟨tc, xa⟩x = (−i)|a|
(2π)k/2 ⟨tω, W1 xa⟩x = 0 ,
since W1 xa = 0.
From (3.2.32) we see that the central solution can be obtained from any
extension t ∈S′(Rk) with sd(t) = sd(t0) by Taylor subtraction in momentum
space:
tc(p) = ˆt(p) −

|a|≤⌊ω⌋
pa
a! ∂aˆt(0) .
(3.2.33)
This corresponds to “BPHZ subtraction” at p = 0.44
If there exists an extension t(m) ∈S′(Rk) which scales almost homogeneously
with degree D ∈N and power N (cf. Proposition 3.2.16 below), i.e.,
(ρ∂ρ)N+1
ρD−k ˆt(m/ρ)(p/ρ)

= 0,
(3.2.34)
then this holds also for the central solution t(m) c with the same degree and the
same power. This follows from (3.2.33), because the scaling relation (3.2.34) implies
that (ρ∂ρ)N+1
ρD−k (p/ρ)a (∂aˆt(m/ρ))(0)

= 0 .
But, it is well known that the limit limm↓0 t(m) c diverges in general; hence,
the central solution is in conﬂict with the Sm-expansion axiom.
We give an example for the existence of the central solution, which belongs
to electrostatics and is taken from [139].

siuk [11] (see also [12]), Hepp [98] and Zimmermann [176].

Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Example 3.2.14 (Self-energy of a classical point charge). The electrostatic potential Φ ∈
D′(R3) of a classical point charge at rest, sitting at the origin, is determined by
△Φ(⃗x) = −4πq δ(⃗x) ,
which gives
Φ(⃗x) = q
|⃗x| ∈D′(R3) ,
where q is the charge of the point particle. The pertinent electric ﬁeld
⃗E(⃗x) = −⃗∇Φ(⃗x) = q ⃗x

exists in
D′(R3, R3) ;
but the energy density
U 0(⃗x) = 1
4π
⃗E2(⃗x) =
q2
4π |⃗x|4
exists only in
D′(R3 \ {0}) .
The singular order reads ω(U 0) = 4 −3 = 1. We can extend U 0 to a distribution
U ∈D′(R3) by means of the W -extension (3.2.27). Working with a projector W of the
form (3.2.29) with wa fulﬁlling (3.2.30), the general solution reads

where w(⃗x) = 1 for all ⃗x in some neighbourhood of ⃗0. To compute the self-energy E of
the point charge we would like to choose h(⃗x) = 1 ∀⃗x. This is indeed possible since 1/|⃗x|4
decays suﬃciently fast for |⃗x| →∞. For the same reason we may choose w(⃗x) = 1 ∀⃗x,
i.e., the central solution exists. With that we obtain
E = ⟨U, 1⟩= C0 .
We may determine C0 by the requirement that the self-energy E is given by the mass m
of the point charge: C0 = mc2.
Universality of W-extension. The central solution preserves most symmetries of
t0. For example: If t0 is Lorentz covariant, the central solution manifestly main-
tains this symmetry. For a W-extension tW as in (3.2.27) and (3.2.29), Lorentz
covariance is at least not manifest, since there does not exist any Lorentz covari-
ant wa ∈D(Rk). On the other hand, Lorentz covariance can always be main-
tained in the extension, as explained in Sect. 3.2.7. From this point of view, the
following lemma is somewhat surprising: It states that every extension t having
sd(t) = sd(t0) – in particular any Lorentz covariant extension fulﬁlling this condi-
tion – is a W-extension (3.2.27) with the projector W given in terms of a family
of functions (wa) (3.2.28) by (3.2.29).
Lemma 3.2.15 ([55]). The following two maps are surjective:
(a) {wa}|a|≤⌊ω⌋−→W = Id −
|a|≤ω wa (−1)|a|∂aδ , from the set of families
of test functions {wa}|a|≤⌊ω⌋with the above property (3.2.28), to the set of
continuous projectors W from D(Rk) onto Dω; and

3.2.
Construction of the retarded product
123
(b) W −→tW = tω ◦W , from the latter set to the set of extensions t of the
given t0 satisfying sd(t) = sd(t0).
Proof. We follow [55, App. B].
Ad (a):
Let a continuous projectors W from D := D(Rk) onto Dω be given.
We consider the pertinent decomposition
D = Dω ⊕E
where
E := Ran(Id −W) .
(3.2.35)
First we show that there is a basis (wa)|a|≤ω of E satisfying (3.2.28). The
decomposition (3.2.35) induces a decomposition of the dual space: Splitting any
f ∈D′ into
f = (f ◦W) + f ◦(Id −W)
we get the decomposition
D′ = D′
ω ⊕D⊥
ω
where
D′
ω := { f ∈D′ 

 ⟨f, h⟩= 0 ∀h ∈E } ,
D⊥
ω := { f ∈D′ 

 ⟨f, h⟩= 0 ∀h ∈Dω } .
(3.2.36)
A basis of D⊥
ω is given by (∂aδ)|a|≤ω. We deﬁne

(−1)|a|wa

|a|≤ω to be the dual
basis in E, that is, (−1)|a|wa ∈E is determined by the condition ⟨∂bδ, (−1)|a|wa⟩=
δb
a ∀|b| ≤ω, which is equivalent to (3.2.28).
It remains to show that the so-constructed functions wa fulﬁll (3.2.29). For
any h ∈D, the function (Id −W)h can be expanded in terms of the basis (wa)|a|≤ω
of E: (Id −W)h(x) = 
a ca wa(x) for some ca ∈C. Since Wh ∈Dω, we obtain
∂bh(0) = ∂b(Id −W)h(0) = cb ,
∀|b| ≤ω .
Hence,
Wh(x) = h(x) −(Id −W)h(x) = h(x) −

|a|≤ω
(∂ah)(0) wa(x) .
Ad (b):
Let an extension t of t0 with sd(t) = sd(t0) be given. We show that
there exists a complementary space E of Dω in D fulﬁlling t|E = 0. Then, deﬁning
W to be the projector W : D −→Dω with Ran(Id −W) = E, we indeed obtain
⟨t, h⟩= ⟨t, Wh⟩+ ⟨t, (Id −W)h⟩= ⟨t, Wh⟩= ⟨tω, Wh⟩= ⟨tW , h⟩,
by using t|E = 0 and t|Dω = tω, which follows from the uniqueness of tω.
To prove the existence of E, let E1 be an arbitrary complementary space of Dω
in D and W1 the pertinent projector W1 : D −→Dω, that is, Ran(Id −W1) = E1.
Now we choose a g ∈Dω with ⟨t, g⟩= 1 and set
E := { k −⟨t, k⟩g


 k ∈E1 } .
(3.2.37)

124
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Obviously E is a vector space and it holds that t|E = 0. To show that D = Dω + E
we split any h ∈D into h = h1 + h2 , h1 ∈E1, h2 ∈Dω. With that we obtain
h = (h1 −⟨t, h1⟩g) + (h2 + ⟨t, h1⟩g)
where
(h1 −⟨t, h1⟩g) ∈E , (h2 + ⟨t, h1⟩g) ∈Dω .
It remains to verify that E ∩Dω = {0}. Let l ∈E ∩Dω. Then, on the one
hand we have l = k −⟨t, k⟩g for some k ∈E1, and on the other hand we get
l = W1l = W1k −⟨t, k⟩W1g = −⟨t, k⟩g. We ﬁnd k = 0 and hence l = 0.
□
Almost homogeneous extension. In our construction of the retarded product, we
will trace back the renormalization (or extension) problem to direct extensions
(3.2.22) and the extension of almost homogeneously scaling distributions t0. In the
latter case, an arbitrary extension t satisfying sd(t) = sd(t0) does not maintain
almost homogeneous scaling; e.g., a term Ca ∂aδ(k) with |a| < sd(t0) −k (which
may be added according to (3.2.21)) violates this property. However, there exist
extensions which preserve almost homogeneous scaling, but in some cases it cannot
be avoided that the power N (see Deﬁnition 3.1.17) is increased by 1. This is
essentially the statement of the following proposition.
Proposition 3.2.16 (Extension of almost homogeneously scaling distributions, [55,
86, 101, 107, 131]). Let t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) scale almost homogeneously with degree
D ∈C and power N0 ∈N. Then there exists an extension t ∈D′(Rk) which scales
also almost homogeneously with degree D and power N ≥N0:
(i) If D /∈N + k, then t is unique and N = N0;
(ii) if D ∈N + k, then t is non-unique and N = N0 or N = N0 + 1. In this case,
given a particular solution t0, the general solution is of the form
t = t0 +

|a|=D−k
Ca ∂aδ(k)
with arbitrary
Ca ∈C.
(3.2.38)
In addition, there exists a homogeneous polynomial
p(∂) =

|a|=D−k
˜Ca ∂a ,
˜Ca ∈C ,
(3.2.39)
such that

x∂x + D
N0+1t(x) = p(∂x)δ(k)(x) ,
where
x∂x :=
k

r=1
xr∂xr ,
(3.2.40)
for all solutions t. So p(∂) is universal in the sense that it depends only on t0,
but not on t. Exercise 3.2.18(c) and Remark 3.5.15 give formulas to compute
p(∂).
For the subcase Re D (= sd(t0)) < k of case (i), the unique t agrees with the direct
extension of t0 (3.2.22).

3.2.
Construction of the retarded product
125
The last sentence is due to the following: For Re D < k the unique t of the
proposition fulﬁlls sd(t) = Re D = sd(t0) < k, hence it agrees with the unique
extension of part (a) of Theorem 3.2.8, which is the direct extension.
Concerning the statement (3.2.39)–(3.2.40), note that universality of p(∂)
follows immediately from (3.2.38), since (x∂x + D) 
|a|=D−k Ca ∂aδ(k)(x) = 0. In
particular in the case N0 = 0, the breaking of homogeneous scaling is the same
local term for all almost homogeneous extensions t: (x∂x + D)t(x) = p(∂)δ(x).
Example 3.2.17. Recall that the massless retarded propagator Dret ∈D′(Rd) scales ho-
mogeneously with degree d −2. Let Q(∂) be a polynomial in the partial derivatives
∂0, . . . , ∂d−1, which is homogeneous of degree q. All homogeneous extensions of
Q(∂) Dret(x) ∈D′(Rd \ {0})
are
Q(∂) Dret(x) +

|a|=q−2
Ca ∂aδ(d)(x) ∈D′(Rd) ,
where the constants Ca ∈C are arbitrary. Note: For q ≥2 we are in case (ii) of the
proposition, in which the direct extension is not (directly) applicable; nevertheless, ho-
mogeneous scaling is maintained.
We prove Proposition 3.2.16 in the following exercise, by following [55, 101].
Exercise 3.2.18. Again we set x∂x := k
r=1 xr∂xr. Let t0, D and N0 be given as in the
proposition and let t1 be an arbitrary extension of t0 with sd(t1) = sd(t0) = Re D, which
exists by Theorem 3.2.8.
(a) Prove that
(x∂x + D)N0+1t1(x) =

|a|≤Re D−k
Ca ∂aδ(k)(x)
(3.2.41)
for some constant numbers Ca ∈C; this relation will be used in the following steps.
(b) In case (i) show that
t := t1 −

|a|≤Re D−k
Ca
(D −k −|a|)N0+1 ∂aδ(k)
(3.2.42)
is an extension with the wanted properties, where the constants Ca are given by
(3.2.41).
(c) In case (ii) the subtraction of the ∂aδ-terms in (3.2.42) does not work for |a| = D−k.
However, show that
t := t1 −

|a|<D−k
Ca
(D −k −|a|)N0+1 ∂aδ(k) .
(3.2.43)
fulﬁlls the assertion. In addition, verify the claim (3.2.39)–(3.2.40) and show that
p(∂) can be obtained from t1 by the formula
p(∂x)δ(k)(x) =

(d) Prove uniqueness in case (i) and formula (3.2.38) for case (ii).

[Solution: (a) Since t0 scales almost homogeneously with power N0, the support of the
left side of (3.2.41) must be contained in {0}; therefore, it is of the form 
a Ca ∂aδ(k)(x)
where the sum is ﬁnite. The upper bound on |a| follows from sd

(x∂x + D)N0+1 t1

≤
sd(t1) = Re D.
(b) Due to (3.2.21), the distribution t (3.2.42) is an extension of t0. By using
(x∂x + D) ∂aδ(k)(x) = (D −k −|a|) ∂aδ(k)(x) ,
(3.2.45)
we verify (x∂x + D)N0+1 t = 0.
(c) Again, t (3.2.43) is obviously an extension. Now we get
(x∂x + D)N0+1 t(x) =

|a|=D−k
Ca∂aδ(k)(x) .
(3.2.46)
However, applying the operator (x∂x + D) once more we get zero, i.e., t scales almost
homogeneously with power ≤N0 + 1.
The claim (3.2.39)–(3.2.40) can be veriﬁed as follows: Relation (3.2.46) says that it is
satisﬁed for the particular solution t constructed in (3.2.43); this holds then for all solu-
tions t, due to the universality of p(∂) explained above.
The idea behind formula (3.2.44) is as follows: p(∂x)δ(k)(x) is equal to the right side
of (3.2.46), which can be obtained from t1 by selecting from (3.2.41) the terms with
|a| = D −k. The operator
1
 D−k−1
j=0
(j −D + k)
D−k−1

l=0
(x∂x + l + k)
does precisely this selection, since x∂x∂aδ(k) = (−k −|a|) ∂aδ(k).
(d) Since ∂aδ(k) scales homogeneously with degree (k + |a|), the terms Ca ∂aδ(k) in the
formula for the general extension (3.2.21), must fulﬁll |a| = D −k, otherwise almost
homogeneous scaling is broken. In case (i) there is no a solving this condition.]
In contrast to this indirect construction (3.2.42)–(3.2.43) of an almost ho-
mogeneous extension, direct constructive proofs of the proposition are given in
[105, 131].45 In both references the basic idea is to introduce spherical coordi-
nates; with that the problem reduces to a one-dimensional extension in the radial
coordinate. The disadvantage of this method is that in general the so-obtained
extension breaks Lorentz covariance.
Another constructive proof of part (b) of the proposition is given by the so-
called “improved Epstein–Glaser renormalization”, which is due to of [85, 122],
see also [86, 131].
Lemma 3.2.19 (Improved W-extension). Assume that a given t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0})
scales almost homogeneously with degree D ∈N + k and power N ∈N. Let ω :=
D −k and let tω be the unique extension of t0 to D′
ω satisfying sd(tω) = sd(t0)
(see Claim 3.2.9). Then, the following statements hold true:
45Formula (186) in [105] contains an error: The extension given by that formula does not scale
almost homogeneously. This can be corrected by using the “improved Epstein–Glaser renorma-
lization” given in Lemma 3.2.19.

, (3.2.47)
where w ∈D(Rk) is identically 1 in some neighbourhood46 of 0, is an exten-
sion of t0 to D′(Rk) which scales also almost homogeneously with degree D,
but the power may be increased to N + 1.
Comparing t (3.2.47) with the W-extension tW (3.2.27) given by wa(x) := xa
a! w(x)
(3.2.30), where w is as assumed in the lemma, we see: Similarly to the deﬁnition
of the central solution (3.2.31), the test function w(x) is replaced by 1, but here
this is done only for the (|a| < ω)-terms. Unfortunately also formula (3.2.47) is
not manifestly Lorentz covariant, since there does not exist a Lorentz invariant
w ∈D(Rk).
Motivated by (3.2.38) one might naively think that a W-extension maintain-
ing almost homogeneous scaling contains only W-subtraction terms with |a| = ω
(i.e., the sum in (3.2.29) is restricted to |a| = ω); but this is wrong, as we see
explicitly from (3.2.47).
Proof. First we note that for any distribution f ∈D′(Rk) (or D′(Rk \ {0}) or
D′
ω(Rk)) it holds that

In the last step we use that xat0 scales almost homogeneously with degree D−|a| =
k −1 and power N; and that this property goes over to the direct extension xat0,
as we know from Proposition 3.2.16.
(b) First part: t exists in D′(Rk) and is an extension of t0. To prove this we
compute (t −tW ), where tW is as just before:
t −tW = −

46Actually, in order that wa(x) =

w(0) = 1. The lemma holds also for this weaker assumption, see [85].

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
We have to show that the expression on the r.h.s. is well deﬁned: Since (1 −w(x))
vanishes in a neighbourhood of x = 0, we may write
⟨tω, (1 −w(x)) xa⟩=
	
dkx t0(x) (1 −w(x)) xa .
This “integral” is IR-ﬁnite, because |t0(x) xa| ∼|x|−D+|a| for |x| →∞(up to
powers of log x) and −D + |a| < −D + ω = −k. Therefore, ⟨tω, (1 −w(x)) xa⟩
exists for |a| < ω and, hence, (t −tW ) is a linear combination of derivatives of the
δ-distribution.
Second part: t scales almost homogeneously with degree D and power ≤N +1.
To verify this we ﬁrst use (3.2.48) and ∂ahρ(0) = ρ−|a|∂ah(0):

□
Some techniques to compute the almost homogeneous extension t of Propo-
sition 3.2.16 in practice are:
• Diﬀerential renormalization – explained in Sect. 3.5.1.
• Analytic regularization – see Sect. 3.5.2, which includes “dimensional regu-
larization in position space” [63] – a method which is always applicable.
• A renormalization method relying on the K¨all´en–Lehmann representation
(explained in Sect. 3.2.8); however, this method is restricted to 2-point func-
tions, i.e., to the case k = d.

The next step in our inductive construction of the retarded product (Rn,1)n∈N,
is to extend s(m) 0
n
∈D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}) to a distribution s(m)
n
in D′(Rd(n−1)) such
that the Sm-expansion (with degree D) is preserved.
• For m = 0 Remk. 3.1.23 applies; hence, we only have to ﬁnd an almost
homogeneous extension sn(X) = u0(X) ∈D′(Rd(n−1)) of s0
n(X) = u0
0(X) ∈
D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}) – this is the problem treated in Proposition 3.2.16 and
Sect. 3.5.
• For m > 0 we extend each distribution u0
0, u0
l,p, r(m) 0
L+1 ∈D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0})
individually.
Due to part (6) of Lemma 3.1.26, the remainders
r(m) 0
L+1
with
L ≥L0 := D −d(n −1)
may be extended by the direct extension (3.2.22).
The distributions u0
l,p (l ≥1) and u0
0 (l = 0) scale almost homogeneously
in X with degrees (D−l). Thus, by Proposition 3.2.16, there exist extensions
ul,p ∈D′(Rd(n−1)) and u0 ∈D′(Rd(n−1)), respectively, which scale almost
homogeneously with the same degree as the corresponding u0
···-distributions.
For l > L0 the almost homogeneous extension is unique and agrees with
the direct extension (3.2.22). For 0 ≤l ≤L0 the extension needs a mass
scale M1 > 0; we choose M1 independent of m, such that ∂mul,p = 0 and
∂mu0 = 0. One may choose M1 = M.
47Here and in what follows notations of type (3.2.20) are used.

(3.2.52)
For L1 ≥L0 the extensions indeed satisfy this relation, because all distri-
butions appearing in (3.2.52) are extended by the unique direct extension.
For L1 < L0 we fulﬁll (3.2.52) for the extensions by deﬁning the extension of
r(m) 0
L1+1 by
r(m)

(3.2.53)
This deﬁnition gives indeed an extension of r(m) 0
L1+1, because (3.2.53) holds true
when restricted to D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}), as we know from (3.2.52).
An extension s(m)
n
∈D′(Rd(n−1)) of s(m) 0
n
, which fulﬁlls the Sm-expan-
sion (with the same degree D as s(m) 0
n
), is obtained by inserting the con-
structed extensions of the various distributions into (3.2.51); it does not
matter which L we use, since the extensions fulﬁll (3.2.52).
The Sm-expansion is very helpful for practical computations: Choos-
ing L = L0 ≡D −d(n −1) it reduces the main problem – the extension
D′(Rd(n−1) \{0}) ∋s(m) 0
n
→s(m)
n
∈D′(Rd(n−1)) – to a minimal set of almost
homogeneously scaling distributions (namely {u0
l,p


 0 ≤l ≤L0, 0 ≤p ≤Pl});
the direct extension of the remainder gives no computational work. Ex-
amples are given in Sects. 3.5.1 and 3.5.2. An alternative method to re-
duce Epstein–Glaser renormalization of a massive model to the extension
D′(Rk \ {0}) →D′(Rk) of almost homogeneously scaling distributions, is
proposed in [132].
3.2.4
Completing the inductive step
In this section we complete the inductive step in the construction of (Rn,1)n∈N:
We construct an extension Sn ∈D′(Mn, F) of S0
n ∈D′(M \ Δn, F) such that all
axioms are satisﬁed.
Step 1. In the construction of the preceding section, which preserves the Sm-
expansion, the extension of s0
n(A1, . . . , An) ≡s(m) 0
n
(A1, . . . , An) is done for mono-
mials A1, . . . , An, only. On the other hand, to fulﬁll the AWI48we intend to con-
48The upper index (m) of s(m) 0
n
and s(m)
n
is omitted in the following. The proof that the AWI
can be maintained in process of renormalization was ﬁrst given in [55]; essentially, we follow the
construction in that reference.

3.2.
Construction of the retarded product
131
struct the retarded products by using the deﬁnition (3.1.4), hence, we want to ex-
tend s0
n(A1, . . . , An) only for49 balanced A1, . . . , An. To give a construction which
preserves the Sm-expansion and uses the deﬁnition (3.1.4), we proceed as fol-
lows: First note that, due to linearity of the map ⊗n
i=1Ai −→s0
n(A1, . . . , An)
and part (0) of Lemma 3.1.26, the Sm-expansion holds for s0
n(A1, . . . , An) for all
A1, . . . , An ∈Phom (and not only for ﬁeld monomials). Using this, we extend
s0
n(A1, . . . , An)(x1 −xn, . . . , xn−1 −xn) for all A1, . . . , An ∈Pbal ∩Phom by means
of the construction of the preceding section. This gives distributions
˜sn(A1, . . . , An)(x1 −xn, . . . , xn−1 −xn) ∈D′(Rd(n−1))
which fulﬁll the Sm-expansion with degree D := n
k=1 dim Ak.
There is the slight issue that the resulting ˜sn might not be symmetric in
(A1, x1), . . . , (An, xn); so we simply symmetrize it:
sn(A1, . . . , An)(x1 −xn, . . . , xn−1 −xn)
:= 1
n!

π∈Sn
˜sn(Aπ(1), . . . , Aπ(n))(xπ(1) −xπ(n), . . . , xπ(n−1) −xπ(n)).
This is also an extension of s0
n(A1, . . . , An), since ˜sn(Aπ(1), . . . )(xπ(1) −xπ(n), . . . )
is an extension of s0
n(Aπ(1), . . . )(xπ(1) −xπ(n), . . . ) = s0
n(A1, . . . )(x1 −xn, . . . ). In
addition, the Sm-expansion is maintained under this symmetrization.
Step 2. Rn−1,1 of arbitrary ﬁeld polynomials is deﬁned in terms of Rn−1,1 of bal-
anced ﬁelds by (3.1.4). This deﬁnition goes over to the symmetric part Sn and
to its VEV sn. In detail: We write arbitrary polynomials Ai (1 ≤i ≤n) as
Ai = 
ai ∂aiBiai with Biai ∈Pbal by using Proposition 1.4.3. From the deﬁni-
tion of balanced ﬁelds (Deﬁnition 1.4.1) we see that every B ∈Pbal can uniquely
be written as a ﬁnite sum B = 
l Bl with Bl ∈Pbal ∩Pl , where Pl is introduced
in Deﬁnition 3.1.18. With that we can uniquely write
Ai =

ai,li
∂aiBli
iai
with
Bli
iai ∈Pbal ∩Pli .
(3.2.54)
Using that the extension sn(Bl1
1a1, . . . , Bln
nan) is already constructed in Step
1, we then deﬁne
sn(A1, . . . , An)(x1 −xn, . . .)
(3.2.55)
:=

a1,l1,...,an,ln
∂a1
x1 · · · ∂an
xnsn(Bl1
1a1, . . . , Bln
nan)(x1 −xn, . . .) .
This expression is well-deﬁned, since one can always take derivatives of distribu-
tions.
49Note that monomials are in general not balanced ﬁelds; but, balanced ﬁelds A with a ﬁxed
order |A| in ϕ (3.1.31) and a ﬁxed number of derivatives are in Phom – see, e.g., Exap. 1.4.2 and
Exer. 1.4.5.

132
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Remark 3.2.20. Let A1, . . . , An ∈P arbitrary. Formula (3.2.55) holds also for
s0
n(A1, . . . , An) ∈D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}), since S0 (constructed in Sect. (3.2.1)) ful-
ﬁlls the AWI. Due to that the following holds: sn(A1, . . . , An) constructed by
(3.2.55) is an extension of s0
n(A1, . . . , An) for all A1, . . . , An ∈P; because, by re-
stricting (3.2.55) to D(Rd(n−1) \ {0}), we see that sn(A1, . . .) is an extension of

a1,l1... ∂a1
x1 · · · s0
n(Bl1
1a1, . . . ), which agrees with s0
n(A1, . . .).
This remark is only a consistency check for our construction of the retarded
product; however, it contains also the basic idea of diﬀerential renormalization,
which we will study in Sect. 3.5.1.
For completeness, we have to verify, on the level of the extensions, that
the Sm-expansion holds true for all monomials A1, . . . , An (and not only for
A1, . . . , An ∈Pbal ∩Phom) – as formulated in our inductive assumption (axiom
(k)). The problem is that in general the elements of Pbal ∩Phom are not mono-
mials, see Exap. 1.4.2. For this purpose we consider the deﬁnition (3.2.55) in the
case that A1, . . . , An are monomials. Then there is no sum over li in (3.2.54) and
in (3.2.55) and we have dim Biai + |ai| = dim Ai for all (i, ai). From part (3) of
Lemma 3.1.26 we know that each summand in (3.2.55) fulﬁlls the Sm-expansion
with degree

hence, this holds also for s(m)

(3.2.56)
By construction, Sn is a symmetric extension of S0
n := SR0
n−1,1, in addition
Sn

A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)

is linear in each Aj(xj) and fulﬁlls the Sm-expansion,
Translation covariance and Field independence; concerning this last property we
recall that the expansion (3.1.23) satisﬁes the Field independence axiom (3.1.20).
The AWI for Sn (3.2.56) can be veriﬁed straightforwardly by using that
(3.2.55) implies the AWI for sn (this is analogous to the step from (3.1.4) to
(3.1.5), see Footn. 24) and the relation
∂y
δA(y)
δϕ(x) = δ(∂A)(y)
δϕ(x)
.

3.2.
Construction of the retarded product

Similarly to (3.1.24), the causal Wick expansion (3.2.56) can be written as

Al⊆Al

A1, . . . , An

(x1 −xn, . . .) A1(x1) · · · An(xn) ,
(3.2.57)
if A1, . . . , An are monomials.
For any symmetric extension Sn of S0
n, the corresponding Rn−1,1 obtained by
(3.2.4) satisﬁes Causality and the GLZ relation; for the following reasons: Causality
cannot get lost in the extension of R0
n−1,1

A1(x1), . . .

from D(Mn\Δn) to D(Mn),
because the thin diagonal is contained in the set on the r.h.s. of (3.1.10). Also the
GLZ relation cannot get lost, because the extension R0
n−1,1 →Rn−1,1 concerns
only the symmetric part Sn of Rn−1,1, and the contributions of Sn to the GLZ
relation (3.1.11b) drop out.
The properties which we have just found for Sn, hold then also for Rn−1,1.
Step 4. How, then, may one fulﬁll the remaining renormalization conditions?
(i) For the ℏ-dependence (axiom (l)): in Step 1, the extension s0
n(A1, . . . , An) →
sn(A1, . . . , An) (where A1, . . . , An ∈Pbal ∩Phom) is done in each order of ℏ
individually.
(ii) For the ∗-structure (axiom (g)): if (Sn(F1, . . . , Fn) fulﬁlls the aforementioned
properties, this is also true for50
Sn(F1, . . . , Fn) := 1
2
(Sn(F1, . . . , Fn) + (Sn(F ∗
1 , . . . , F ∗
n)∗
,
(3.2.58)
which moreover satisﬁes Sn(F ∗
1 , . . . , F ∗
n) = Sn(F1, . . . , Fn)∗. This Sn is an
extension of S0
n, because S0
n is ∗-symmetric.
The Field parity axiom (3.1.34) can trivially be fulﬁlled: For any n-tupel
(A1, . . . , An) of ﬁeld monomials for which n
j=1 |Aj| is odd, we extend
s0
n(A1, . . . , An) = 0 ∈D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0})
by
sn(A1, . . . , An) := 0 ∈D′(Rd(n−1)) .
(iii) How more complicated symmetries, in particular Lorentz covariance, current
conservation and gauge symmetries, can be maintained in the extension s0
n →
sn, is explained in Sect. 3.2.7 and Chaps. 4 and 5.
(iv) It remains the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation (axiom (j)). Due to the causal Wick
expansion (3.1.23)–(3.1.24), the Field equation (3.1.45) is equivalent to

and for all n ≥2, g ∈D(M). The expression on the r.h.s. gives an extension of
r0
n−1,1(F1, . . . , Fn−1; ϕ(g)), because the Field equation holds outside the thin
diagonal. It is compatible with all other axioms and respects the AWI;
this can be veriﬁed straightforwardly by using the inductive assumption
(cf. Exer. 3.1.16 and the sentences directly before that exercise) – except
for the GLZ relation. Concerning the latter, we proceed as follows: From
(3.2.59) and the inductively known jn−2,2

the Field equation in the just described way and fulﬁlls the required prop-

Remark 3.2.22. Similarly to the equivalence of the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation in terms
of R(· · · ) (3.1.45) and r(· · · ) (3.2.59), the validity of (3.2.60) for all F1, . . . , Fn−1 ∈

the GLZ relation, analogously to the step from (3.2.59) to (3.2.60); for example,
in the solution of Exer. 3.2.21 we may throughout replace r(· · · ) by R(· · · ) if we
omit ω0.

3.2.5
Scaling degree axiom versus Sm-expansion axiom
In the literature (e.g.,[24, 66, 148]) the axiom (k) – the Sm-expansion – is frequently
replaced by the following weaker axiom:
Scaling degree: For all A1, . . . , An ∈Phom one requires
sd rn−1,1(A1, . . . , An)(x1 −xn, . . . ) ≤
n

j=1
dim Aj .
(3.2.62)
We give the precise formulation of the relation to the Sm-expansion axiom:
Corollary 3.2.23.
(a) Every f (m) ∈D′(Rk[\{0}]) fulﬁlling the Sm-expansion with degree D ∈R,
satisﬁes sd(f (m)) ≤D.
(b) It follows: Every solution (R(m)
n−1,1)n∈N∗of the axioms given in Sect. 3.1 fulﬁlls
the scaling degree property (3.2.62).
Proof. (a) By deﬁnition of the Sm-expansion we may write f (m)(X) = u0(X) +
r(m)
1
(X) , where u0 scales almost homogeneously with degree D, hence sd(u0) = D.
From part (6) of Lemma 3.1.26 we know sd(r(m)
1
) ≤D −1. We conclude
sd(f (m)) ≤max{sd(u0), sd(r(m)
1
)} = D .
(b) By the Sm-expansion axiom the distributions r(m)
n−1,1(A1, . . . , An) fulﬁll the
Sm-expansion with degree D := n
j=1 dim Aj for all monomials A1, . . . , An. As
explained in Step 1 above, this holds then even for all A1, . . . , An ∈Phom. With
that, the claim follows by means of part (a).
□
If one uses the scaling degree axiom (3.2.62) instead of the axiom (k) in the
inductive construction of the retarded product, this weaker requirement plays also
the role of a renormalization condition: Below in Remk. 3.2.25 we verify that the
scaling degree of s0
n(A1, . . . , An) ∈D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}) is bounded by 
j dim Aj for
all A1, . . . , An ∈Phom. The axiom (3.2.62) translates then into the requirement,
that the extension sn(A1, . . . , An) ∈D′(Rd(n−1)) satisﬁes also this bound for all
Aj ∈Phom.
Since, up to very few exceptions, it holds that sds0
n(A1,...,An)=
jdimAj,
this axiom can be understood as the requirement that renormalization may not
make the retarded products “more singular” (in the UV-region). Substituting
(3.2.62) for the axiom (k), the set of allowed retarded products gets truly big-
ger. An example for this is given in Remk. 3.5.17.
Remark 3.2.24 (Scaling degree axiom for arbitrary ﬁeld polynomials). We are
going to show that the scaling degree condition (3.2.62) can equivalently be for-

Remark 3.2.25 (Proof of Scaling degree axiom for S0

following statement: Let (Rl,1)l=0,1,...,n−2 be constructed such that they satisfy the
basic axioms and the axiom Scaling degree (3.2.62) and let R0

plained in Propositions 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. Then, S0
n fulﬁlls also the axiom Scaling
degree (3.2.62).
Proof. Similarly to the proof of the Sm-expansion axiom for S0
n (Proposition
3.2.2), the nontrivial step is to show that jn−2,2(A1, . . . ; An−1, An)(x1 −xn, . . . ) ∈

n(· · · ) ∈D′(Mn \ Δn, F) (given in
(3.3.17)–(3.3.18)) fulﬁlls the Scaling degree axiom, has to master precisely the same problem as
stated here in (3.2.65)–(3.2.66). That proof can be found in [66, Sect. 6.1], [148, Chap. 4.3] or
[24, Lemma 6.6]. However, the ﬁrst two references work with diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the scaling
degree, in addition they both proceed in momentum space. And the last reference needs a re-
ﬁnement of Steinmann’s deﬁnition of the scaling degree (Deﬁnition 3.2.5), because it treats the
problem on curved spacetimes – the latter makes the problem mathematically more demanding.

The diﬃculty is that f(u, v, z) contains pointwise products of distributions. As

prove that such pointwise products exist.

we explain below, ˜hm is also smooth; hence ˜hm ∈D(Rd(n−2)). We point out that
this holds true for all m ≥0; in particular also for m = 0.
From the Sm-expansion of Δ+

sions) we know that52
∂aΔ+
ρm(z) = ∂aD+(z) + O(ρm) ,
where O(ρm) includes terms ∼ρm logp ρm

with p ∈N. Inserting this into the
deﬁnition of ˜hρm we obtain
˜hρm = ˜h0 + O(ρm) .
52In even dimensions the relation is stronger: ∂aΔ+
ρm(z) = ∂aD+(z) + O(ρ2m2).

3.2.
Construction of the retarded product

Therefore, considering the limit (3.2.68), the leading term comes from the massless
two point function, that is, from ˜h0:
(3.2.68) = lim
ρ↓0 ρD1+D2+ε ⟨r1(ρu) r2(ρv), ˜h0(u, v)⟩u,v .
(3.2.69)
Because ˜h0 ∈D(Rd(n−2)), we may apply the tensor product rule, sd(r1 ⊗r2) =
sd(r1) + sd(r2) (Exer. 3.2.7(c)(v)), to conclude that the limit (3.2.69) vanishes
indeed.
To show that ˜hm is smooth for all m ≥0, we verify that
'
˜hm(p, q) ∼
	
du dv ei(up+vq) ˜hm(u, v)
decays rapidly in all directions. To simplify the notations we do this for a typical
example:
l = 2 = p ,
k = 3 ,
i1 = i2 = i3 = 1 ,
j1 = j2 = 1 , j3 = 2 .
Omitting constant prefactors we get

∥k1 + k2∥→∞, then ∥−k1 −k2 −k3∥→∞, due to the factors θ(k0

These facts imply that '
˜hm decays rapidly in all directions. Namely, for example,
if ∥q1∥→∞and we want to keep ∥q1 + k1 + k2∥ﬁnite, then ∥k1 + k2∥→∞and,
hence, ∥−k1 −k2 −k3∥→∞.

3.2.6
The general solution of the axioms
We are going to study the general solution of the inductive step Rn−2,1 →Rn−1,1;
the result depends on the precise formulation of the Sm-expansion axiom.
Stronger version of the Sm-expansion axiom. The ﬁrst part of the inductive step –
the “oﬀΔn” part – is uniquely determined by the basic axioms; and, as explained
in Sect. 3.2.4, the second part – the extension to Δn – amounts to the extension
s0
n(A1, . . . , An) →sn(A1, . . . , An) for all A1, . . . , An ∈Pbal ∩Phom. By the Sm-
expansion axiom, the extension s0
n →sn is reduced to the almost homogeneous
extension of the coeﬃcients u(m) 0
l
(deﬁned in (3.2.51)), where the extensions u(m)
l
must also be polynomials in log m
M . The latter extension is restricted by some fur-
ther renormalization conditions, as explained in Step 4 of Sect. 3.2.4; but in general
it is still non-unique. It can be further restricted by the following supplement to
the Sm-expansion axiom, which forbids that in the extension u(m) 0
l
→u(m)
l
new
powers of log m
M emerge.

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
(k′) Addition to Sm-expansion axiom: In each inductive step and for all A1, . . .
. . . , An ∈Pbal ∩Phom, do the extension s0
n(A1, . . . , An) →sn(A1, . . . , An) as
described in Sect. 3.2.3, that is, extend the coeﬃcients u0
0, u0
l,p ∈D′(Rd(n−1)\
{0}) in the Sm-expansion of s(m) 0
n
(3.2.51) by almost homogeneous and m-
independent distributions u0, ul,p ∈D′(Rd(n−1)). In particular, we extend
zero by zero, that is, if u0
l0,p0 = 0 we set ul0,p0 := 0. The general solution for
u0, ul,p is given by (3.2.38), where the coeﬃcients Ca are m-independent.
The axiom (k) completed by (k′) is called the “stronger version of the Sm-expan-
sion axiom”. Using the additional prescription (k′), we obtain a particular subset
Bpart of the set B of all retarded products R ≡(Rn,1)n∈N solving the axioms with-
out (k′). Since the Sm-expansion of each s(m) 0
n
(3.2.51) is unique, this deﬁnition
of Bpart is unique.
Remark 3.2.26 (Even spacetime dimensions). We claim: If d is even and if we
require the addition (k′), then solely even powers of m appear in the Sm-expansion
of r(A1, . . . , An) for all monomials A1, . . . , An not depending on m.
This can be seen as follows: From Exer. 3.1.24 we know that the claim holds
true for Δ+
m in d = 4 dimensions; and one veriﬁes analogously that this result is
correct for all even values of d, see [55, App. A]. Using that, and following the
inductive construction of the R-products, we inductively conclude from (3.2.6)–
(3.2.8) that the claim holds for jn−2,2; hence, it holds also for r0
n−1,1 and for s0
n.
Finally, due to the addition (k′), it is maintained in the extension s0
n →sn.
The most general solution of the axioms without (k′). The set B (deﬁned shortly
above Remk. 3.2.26) is obtained by adding – in each inductive step – to a particular
solution s(m)(A1, . . . , An)(x1 −xn, . . . ), A1, . . . , An ∈Pbal ∩Phom, a polynomial
in derivatives of the delta distribution which fulﬁlls the Sm-expansion:

Cl,p,a(A1, . . . , An) ∂aδ(x1−xn, . . . , xn−1−xn) . (3.2.71)
Here, Sn denotes symmetrization w.r.t. permutations of the pairs (A1, x1), . . .
. . . , (An, xn), and the sum runs over l ∈N, p ∈N and a ∈Nd(n−1), with the
restrictions
|a|+l = D−d(n−1) ,
p ≤Pl for some Pl < ∞and (for l = 0) P0 = 0 (3.2.72)
(the latter is due to ∂mu0 = 0); the numbers Cl,p,a(A1, . . . , An) ∈C do not
depend on m. In addition (3.2.71) has to be Lorentz covariant; the coeﬃcients
Cl,p,a(A1, . . . , An) are also restricted by further axioms as, e.g., the ∗-structure:
Cl,p,a(A∗
1, . . . , A∗
n) = Cl,p,a(A1, . . . , An).
Or, to compare with the above prescription (k′) we may say: To obtain the
set B, the general extension of the coeﬃcients u(m) 0
l
∈D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}) (3.2.51)

The diﬀerence between the sets Bpart and B is illustrated in Exap. 3.5.4 and
Remk. 3.5.17; it plays also a deciding role for the mass renormalization of the
ϕ4-model in d = 4 dimensions, see Exap. 3.8.2 and Sect. 3.8.2.
Remark 3.2.27 (Odd spacetime dimensions). In our construction of the particular
solutions Bpart of the axioms, the factors log m
M come solely from the (log m
M )-term
in Δ+ (d)
m
, i.e., the appearance of these factors is due to the (unique) “oﬀΔn part”
of the inductive step (given in Sect. 3.2.1). For d odd, Δ+ (d)
m
does not contain
any (log m
M )-term – it is smooth in m ≥0. Hence, the stronger version of the Sm-
expansion axiom reduces to a Taylor expansion in m, i.e., Pl = 0 ∀l in (3.2.51).
Or: For d odd the stronger version of the Sm-expansion axiom is equivalent to the
conditions that the retarded products R(m) scale almost homogeneously under
(X, m) →(ρX, m/ρ) (by which we mean (3.1.67)) and that the maps 0 ≤m −→
R(m)
n−1,1(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn) be smooth, for all F1, . . . , Fn ∈Floc and for all n.
When quantizing with a Hadamard function, this remark applies to all di-
mensions d > 2, see App. A.4 and [55].

L(g)⊗n, F

as a function of n. Ob-
viously, this function depends on the interaction L. If it is unbounded, one needs
inﬁnitely many additional informations to ﬁx the model uniquely to all orders of
the perturbation series. In particular, if the number of indeterminate parameters
having observable consequences is unbounded in n, one would need inﬁnitely many
experiments to determine the observable predictions of the model completely. An
important example for this unsatisfactory situation is spin-2 gauge theory (see,
e.g., [149, Chap. 5]) – this is a main reason why a perturbative approach to quan-
tum gravity is conceptually problematic. A way out is to interpret perturbative
quantum gravity as an “eﬀective” theory, that is, it is used only to model physical
situations in which the eﬀects of quantum gravity are small and, hence, the higher
orders of the perturbation series may be neglected, see [28] and [143, Chap. 8].
However, we point out, that even for such “non-renormalizable” models, causal
perturbation theory produces a ﬁnite result for the renormalized R-product to
every ﬁxed order in the coupling constant and in ℏ.


coming from the inductive step (n −1, 1) →(n, 1), i.e., the
number of independent constants Cl,p,a(. . .) in (3.2.71). This number depends on
the choice of the renormalization conditions. In the following we presume only
Translation covariance, Field independence (axiom (f)) and the stronger version
of the Sm-expansion (axioms (k) and (k′)), in particular Lorentz covariance and
the AWI will not be used. The latter makes an essential diﬀerence, as the following
example shows: If we require the AWI, the retarded product
r(∂μϕ, ∂νϕ)(x −y) = ∂μ
x∂ν
y r(ϕ, ϕ)(x −y) = ℏ(∂μ∂νΔret)(x −y)
is unique; in contrast, if we omit the AWI but require Lorentz covariance, we may
add a term C gμν δ(x −y) (where C ∈C is an arbitrary constant), and if we omit
also Lorentz covariance a term Cμν δ(x −y) is admitted for any constant tensor
Cμν.
In the following proposition it suﬃces to study the case that L and A are
monomials, due to linearity of Rn,1 (axiom (a)).
Proposition 3.2.28 (Renormalizability by power counting, [55]). Let L, A ∈P be
monomials and let N(L, A, ·) be the function
N(L, A, ·):

N −→N
n −→N(L, A, n) .
With the just mentioned renormalization conditions the following statements53
hold true for all monomials A ∈P \ C.
(a) N(L, A, ·) is bounded if and only if dim L ≤d.
(b) The number of non-vanishing values of N(L, A, ·) is ﬁnite if and only if
dim L < d.
An interaction L fulﬁlling (a) is called “renormalizable by power counting”.
An important example is L = κϕ4 in d = 4 dimensions. In the (algebraic) adiabatic
limit and with the usual renormalization conditions (also Lorentz covariance), this
model has 4 indeterminate parameters, each being a formal power series in κ and
ℏ; see Exap. 3.8.2 in Sect. 3.8.1.
53The case A ∈C is excluded, because in that case it holds that Rn,1

(L(g))⊗n; A(x)

= 0 ∀L(g)
and for all n ≥1, see Remk. 3.1.4.

3.2.
Construction of the retarded product
143
If dim L < d (case (b) of the proposition), only the lowest orders of the
perturbation series (3.2.73) require “nontrivial” renormalization, all higher orders
can be renormalized by the direct extension (3.2.22), that is, they are unique; such
an L is called “super-renormalizable”.
In the literature (also in causal perturbation theory [66, 148, 149]) the count-
ing of indeterminate parameters is usually done in terms of the S-matrix in the
adiabatic limit (i.e., for 
n
κn
n! limg→1 Tn

(L(g))⊗n
where Tn is the time-ordered
product introduced in Sect. 3.3), and the corresponding version of the proposition
can be proved rather easily, see, e.g., [12, Sect. 28.1]. It does not make an essen-
tial diﬀerence that we count in terms of retarded products. But, since we do not
perform the adiabatic limit, our discussion is more involved.
Proof. We only treat the case “d is even”, which is more diﬃcult than the case “d
is odd”, as explained in Remk. 3.2.27.
Using the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24), the indeﬁniteness of the R-product
Rn,1

(L(g))⊗n; A(x)

is precisely the indeﬁniteness of all C-number distributions
rn,1(U1, . . . , Un; U) with U1, . . . , Un ⊆L and U ⊆A. We will use the relations
0 ≤dim Uj ≤dim L
and
0 ≤dim U ≤dim A ,
which follow from (3.1.58). From (3.2.71) we know that the indeﬁniteness of
rn,1(U1, . . . , Un; U)(x1 −x, . . .) is of the form

(3.2.77)

144
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Namely, in the stronger version of the Sm-expansion all factors log m
M come from
the (log m
M )-term in Δ+ (d)
m
(cf. Remk. 3.2.27), which contains a factor md−2 accord-
ing to formula (2.2.3) (case d = 4) or formula (A.17) in [55] (case d = 4 + 2k , k ∈
N∗). Therefore, in the Sm-expansion of any distribution r(A1, . . . , An+1) (3.1.61),
each factor log m
M is accompanied by at least (d−2) factors m; that is, the power of
m (= 2l) and the pertinent powers of log m
M (= p) fulﬁll the relation 2l ≥p(d−2).
This must hold also for (3.2.74).
The main point of the proof is that ωn is bounded by
ωn ≡ωn(U1, . . . , Un, U) ≤dim A + n(dim L −d) ,
∀Uj ⊆L , U ⊆A , n ∈N .
(3.2.78)
With that the only non-obvious statement of the proposition is that for an
interaction L with dim L = d the function N(L, A, ·) is bounded for any ﬁxed A.
The boundedness of n −→ωn alone (given by (3.2.78)) does not suﬃce to prove
this, we have to take into account also the following arguments:
• The number of n-tuples (U1, . . . , Un) with Uj ⊆L ∀j, is increasing with
n. But due to the restriction ωn(U1, . . . , Un, U) ≥0 and the symmetry in
U1, . . . , Un, only n-tuples of the form
(U1, . . . , Us, L, . . . , L)
with
U1, . . . , Us ⊆L ,
s := ⌊min
!
n, dim A
dim ϕ
"
⌋
(3.2.79)
can be relevant. For n ≥dim A
dim ϕ the number of such n-tupels does not depend
on n.
• The number of indices a ∈Ndn with |a| = ω, for some ﬁxed ω > 0, is
also increasing with n. But here, the symmetrization Sn saves the mat-
ter: Taking into account also (3.2.79), we conclude that only indices a =
(a1, . . . , as, as+1, . . . , an) (where aj ∈Nd and |a| = n
j=1 |aj| = ω) appear
which are symmetrical in as+1, . . . , an. The number of such indices becomes
independent of n if n is big enough.
To give an example let s be ﬁxed and d = 2; we consider the set of all
indices (as+1, . . . , an) with n
j=s+1 |aj| = 2. Then, for all n ≥s + 2 this set
has only 6 elements:
(as+1, . . . , an) = Sn−s

where Sn−s denotes symmetrization in as+1, . . . , an.
Since, in addition, there are n-independent bounds for the ranges of l and p, we
conclude from (3.2.76) and (3.2.78) that the function N(L, A, ·) is indeed bounded.

Maintaining symmetries in the extension of distributions
Mostly the hard (and not always solvable) part of the renormalization problem is
to preserve the symmetries of the initial (i.e., unrenormalized) expression.
The procedure in this section is limited to symmetries with respect to com-
pact groups and some further groups, the most important of which is the Lorentz
group. But it does not apply to scaling transformations, the conservation of cer-
tain currents and gauge invariance. To treat also the latter symmetries, a general
study of symmetries is given in Chap. 4, in terms of the “Master Ward Identity”.
We investigate the question whether the symmetry with respect to a given
group G can be maintained in the process of renormalization. Or in mathematical
terms: Given a t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) which is symmetric with respect to G and scales
almost homogeneously with degree D ∈N under x →ρx (3.1.46), does there
exist an extension t ∈D′(Rk) which is also G-symmetric and scales also almost
homogeneously with degree D? We follow [55, App. D], which is based on lecture
notes of K. Fredenhagen [73].54
Existence of a symmetric extension. Let V be a representation of a group G de-
ﬁned on both D′(Rk) and D′(Rk \ {0}), i.e.,
V (g) D′(Rk) ⊆D′(Rk)
and
V (g) D′(Rk \ {0}) ⊆D′(Rk \ {0})
∀g ∈G ,
which fulﬁlls the following assumptions:
(a) The given t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) is invariant under V : V (g)t0 = t0 , ∀g ∈G.
(b) If t ∈D′(Rk) is an arbitrary extension of t0, then V (g)t is an extension of
V (g)t0 = t0.
(c) Almost homogeneous scaling with degree D (3.1.46) is preserved under V (g),
∀g ∈G.
Remark 3.2.29. Frequently, and in particular in the case of Lorentz covariance,
the representation V is given in the following way: There is a corresponding rep-
resentation W of G on D(Rk) under which D(Rk \ {0}) and t0 are invariant, by
the latter we mean
⟨t0, W(g)h⟩= ⟨t0, h⟩
∀h ∈D(Rk \ {0}) , g ∈G .
Then, V := W T is the transposed representation of G on D′(Rk) or D′(Rk \ {0}),
respectively, that is, it is deﬁned by
⟨V (g)s, h⟩:= ⟨s, W(g−1)h⟩,
∀s ∈D′(Rk[\{0}]) , h ∈D(Rk[\{0}]) , g ∈G .
(3.2.80)
54The later paper [3] by Bahns and Wrochna develops an alternative method to address this
issue.

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
With that, (a) and (b) need not to be assumed, they can be derived: This is
obvious for (a); and (b) is obtained as follows: If t is an extension of t0 and if
h ∈D(Rk \ {0}), we know that W(g−1)h ∈D(Rk \ {0}) and, hence,
⟨V (g)t, h⟩= ⟨t, W(g−1)h⟩= ⟨t0, W(g−1)h⟩= ⟨t0, h⟩
∀g ∈G .
(3.2.81)
To show the existence of a G-invariant and almost homogeneous extension
of the given t0, we start with an arbitrary extension t ∈D′(Rk) of t0 which scales
almost homogeneously with degree D. From the assumptions (b), (c) and from
(3.2.38) we conclude that55

ω (Rk) we ﬁnd
V (g)˜l =

V (g)(t + ˜l) −V (g)t

∈˜D⊥
ω (Rk) ,
since this is the diﬀerence of two almost homogeneous extensions of t0. Hence,
G ∋g −→π(g) := V (g)



 ˜D⊥
ω (Rk)
(3.2.84)
is a sub-representation of V .
We are searching an l0 ∈˜D⊥
ω (Rk) such that t + l0 is invariant,
V (g)(t + l0) = t + l(g) + V (g)l0
!= t + l0 ,
(3.2.85)
i.e., l0 must fulﬁll
l(g) = l0 −π(g)l0 ,
∀g ∈G .
(3.2.86)
From (3.2.82) it follows that l(g) has the property
l(g1g2) = π(g1)l(g2) + l(g1) ,
∀g1, g2 ∈G ,
(3.2.87)
because
l(g1g2) = V (g1g2)t −t = V (g1)

V (g2)t −t

+ V (g1)t −t = π(g1)l(g2) + l(g1) .
A solution G ∋g −→l(g) ∈˜D⊥
ω (Rk) of (3.2.87) is called a “cocycle”. If l(g) is
of the form (3.2.86) for some l0 ∈˜D⊥
ω (Rk), it is called a “coboundary”; and such
55In the notation l(g) we suppress that l(g) depends on t, since t is ﬁxed in the following.
56In contrast to the deﬁnition of Dω(Rk) (3.2.23) and D⊥
ω (Rk) (3.2.36), the sum over a in the
deﬁnition of ˜D⊥
ω (Rk) runs only over |a| = ω (and not |a| ≤ω); to mark this diﬀerence we write
˜D⊥
ω (Rk) instead of D⊥
ω (Rk).

3.2.

an l(g) solves automatically the cocycle equation (3.2.87), as one veriﬁes easily.
The space of the cocycles modulo the coboundaries is called the cohomology of
the group with respect to the representation π. Summing up, the invariance of t0
with respect to the representation V of G can be maintained in the extension if
the cohomology of G with respect to π (3.2.84) is trivial, i.e., if every cocycle is a
coboundary.
We are now going to show that this supposition holds true if all ﬁnite-
dimensional representations of G are completely reducible. For this purpose we
consider the restriction of V (g) to the space (C · t) ⊕˜D⊥
ω (Rk). From (3.2.83) we
see that this is a ﬁnite-dimensional representation of G, which may be identiﬁed
with the matrix representation

where we identify (c t+d) with

. Note that all elements of (C·t)⊕˜D⊥
ω (Rk) scale
almost homogeneously with degree D. Because ˜D⊥
ω (Rk) is an invariant subspace
for π and because we presuppose that π is completely reducible, there exists a
one-dimensional subspace U which is complementary to ˜D⊥
ω (Rk),
(C·t)⊕˜D⊥
ω (Rk) = U ⊕˜D⊥
ω (Rk) ,
and which is invariant:
π(g) U ⊆U ∀g ∈G .
Such a subspace is of the form U = C ·

For the Lorentz group L↑
+ all ﬁnite-dimensional representations are com-
pletely reducible and, hence, the Lorentz invariance can be maintained in pertur-
bative renormalization.57
However, for the scaling transformations one has to consider the representa-
tions of (R+, · ), where “ · ” denotes multiplication. They are not always completely
reducible. An example for a reducible but not completely reducible representation
is

the breaking of homogeneous scaling in perturbative renormalization.
57Related proofs for the existence of a Lorentz covariant extension are given in [138], [43, App. A]
and, e.g., [18, 105]. Historically, the ﬁrst one was [138]; the next one was [43, App. A], whose
authors did not know the paper [138], since the latter was published only much later.

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Construction of a symmetric extension. There remains the question: Given l(g),
how to ﬁnd the solution l0 of the equation (3.2.86) (if it exists). For compact
groups58 this can be done in the following way: We set
l0 :=
	
G
dg l(g) ,
(3.2.91)
where dg is the uniquely determined measure on G which has norm 1 and is
invariant under left- and right-translations (Haar measure). To verify that (3.2.91)
solves (3.2.86) we use the cocycle equation (3.2.87):
l0 −π(g)l0 =
	
G
dh

l(h) −π(g)l(h)

=
	
G
dh

l(h) −l(gh) + l(g)

.
(3.2.92)
Due to translation invariance of the Haar measure, the integrals over the ﬁrst two
terms cancel, and since the measure is normalized we indeed obtain (3.2.86).
Example 3.2.30 (∗-structure). A very simple example for the method (3.2.91) is the sym-
metrization (3.2.58). In detail: In terms of the coeﬃcients
s(x1 −xn, . . .) := sn

A1, . . . , An

(x1 −xn, . . .)
appearing in the causal Wick expansion of Sn

A1(x1), . . .

(3.2.57), the ∗-structure con-
dition Sn

A1(x1), . . .
∗= Sn

reads s = s, where we assume that the mono-
mials Aj are real: A∗
j = Aj (which implies A∗
j = Aj and A
∗
j = Aj, ∀Aj ⊆Aj, see (3.1.25))
for all j – this assumption does not restrict generality.
For the coeﬃcients s0 ∈D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}) of S0
n(A1(x1), . . .) ∈D′(Mn \ Δn, F) we
inductively know that s0 = s0. Let u be an arbitrary, almost homogeneous extension
of s0. The symmetry group is G =

{−1, 1}, ·

where “ · ” denotes multiplication. The
representation V is given by
V (−1)t = t ,
V (1)t = t ,
∀t ∈D′(Rd(n−1)[\{0}]) ;
obviously V satisﬁes the assumptions (a), (b) and (c). Following our procedure, we obtain
l(1) = 0 ,
l(−1) = u −u ∈˜D⊥
ω (Rd(n−1)) .
The integral (3.2.91) is a ﬁnite sum, explicitly
l0 = 1


l(1) + l(−1)

and the pertinent symmetric extension reads
s = u + l0 = 1


u + u

.
This formula is the symmetrization (3.2.58) in terms of the coeﬃcients s ≡sn(A1, · · · ).
58A compact group G is a topological group (that is, G is also a topological space such that the
group operations (g1, g2) −→g1g2 and g −→g−1 are continuous) whose topology is compact
(i.e., every open cover of G contains a ﬁnite cover). Compact groups are a generalization of ﬁnite
groups with the discrete topology.

Lorentz invariance. For the Lorentz group the method (3.2.91) fails, since it is
non-compact – however, see [66].
To construct a Lorentz invariant extension, we give here a method which has
some resemblance with [155] and [18]: The strategy is to construct a projector P
on the space Einv of all Lorentz invariant vectors in the representation π (3.2.88).
Then, with t being the above used arbitrary extension of t0 (with the mentioned
scaling property), the deﬁnition
tinv := Pt ,
(3.2.93)
yields a L↑
+-invariant distribution. And it is also an extension of t0 with the re-
quired scaling property, if P is such that (tinv −t) ∈˜D⊥
ω (Rk).
To construct P we search an operator A: (C·t)⊕˜D⊥
ω (Rk) −→(C·t)⊕˜D⊥
ω (Rk)
such that A−1(0) = Einv and, writing A as a matrix (with the identiﬁcation used
also in (3.2.88)), the upper right coeﬃcient of A is = 0 and A is diagonalizable.
Assuming that we have found such an operator we proceed as follows: Let a0 =
0, a1, . . . , al (where ar ̸= as for r < s) be the eigenvalues of A and let Es :=
(A −as Id)−1(0) be the corresponding eigenspaces; note E0 = Einv. Since A is
diagonalizable we may write
(C · t) ⊕˜D⊥
ω (Rk) = Einv ⊕
l
*
s=1
Es .
For r, s ̸= 0, es ∈Es and e0 ∈Einv we have
ar Id −A
ar
es = ar −as
ar
es (= 0 for r = s)
and
as Id −A
as
e0 = e0 ;
from these relations we conclude that the operator
P := a1 Id −A
a1
· a2 Id −A
a2
· · · al Id −A
al
(3.2.94)
is a projector on Einv. Namely, write any v ∈(C · t) ⊕˜D⊥
ω (Rk) as v = l
s=0 es
with es ∈Es for all 0 ≤s ≤l; then Pv = e0.
To verify (tinv −t) ∈˜D⊥
ω (Rk) we write
tinv = Pt = P(t + l0) −Pl0 = t + l0 −Pl0 ,
(3.2.95)
where l0 ∈˜D⊥
ω (Rk) is chosen such that it fulﬁlls (3.2.86), i.e., t + l0 is invariant
(3.2.85). We see from (3.2.94) that the upper right coeﬃcient of the matrix P is
= 0, since this holds for A. Hence,
Pl0 =

Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
To ﬁnd A we use the following general fact: For a quadratic Casimir opera-
tor59 C (in any representation ˜π of a group G) the invariant vectors (with respect
to G) Einv are a subspace of its kernel ˜π(C)−1(0), because ˜π(Xa) Einv = 0 for
all a (see Footn. 59 for the notation). In case of the Lorentz group L↑
+, we will
ﬁnd a Casimir operator C0 with Einv = ˜π(C0)−1(0) in each ﬁnite-dimensional
representation ˜π.
For the representation π (3.2.88), the matrix π(C0) is a lower triangle matrix,
since π(Xa) is a lower triangle matrix for all a. In addition, π(C0) is diagonalizable;
this follows by means of Schur’s lemma60 from the facts that π(C0) commutes with
all π(Xa) and that π is completely reducible. Summing up, A := π(C0) fulﬁlls the
above made assumptions.
To determine a Casimir operator C0 of the Lorentz group with ˜π(C0)−1(0) =
Einv in each ﬁnite-dimensional representation ˜π, we use the well-known result that
there are two quadratic Casimirs,
C0 = ⃗L2 −⃗
M 2
and
C1 = ⃗L · ⃗
M ,
(3.2.96)
where ⃗L denotes the inﬁnitesimal rotations and ⃗
M the inﬁnitesimal Lorentz boosts.
For the representation on D(R4) it holds that
⃗L = 1
i ⃗x × ⃗∂,
⃗
M = 1
i (x0⃗∂−⃗x ∂0) .
(3.2.97)
Since the representation ˜π is completely reducible, we can investigate the question
whether the Casimirs (3.2.96) satisfy ˜π(Cj)−1(0)
?= Einv by studying the irre-
ducible ﬁnite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group L↑
+. The latter are
those irreducible ﬁnite-dimensional representations of SL(2, C) which represent the
matrix (−1) by Id. The irreducible ﬁnite-dimensional representations of SL(2, C)
are indexed by two spin quantum numbers j1, j2 ∈1
2N and have the form
πj1j2(A)

ξ⊗2j1 ⊗η⊗2j2
= (Aξ)⊗2j1 ⊗((A∗)−1η)⊗2j2
(3.2.98)
with ξ, η ∈C2 , A ∈SL(2, C) and A∗:= AT . For j1 + j2 ∈N this yields a
representation of the Lorentz group, since πj1j2(−1) = (−1)2(j1+j2) Id. We denote
by ⃗Li, ⃗
Mi the representations of ⃗L and ⃗
M on the left (i = 1) and the right factor
59It suﬃces here to consider Casimir operators which are quadratic. By a quadratic Casimir
C for a Lie group G, we mean an expression which is quadratic in the basis vectors (Xa) of
the pertinent Lie algebra G, C = 
a,b ca,bXaXb for some ca,b ∈C, and which commutes with
all Xa. For example, the quadratic Casimirs of the Lorentz group are given in (3.2.96). For a
representation ˜π of G, ˜π(C) is deﬁned to be the linear operator ˜π(C) = 
a,b ca,b ˜π(Xa)˜π(Xb).
60We mean here the following version of Schur’s lemma: Let ρ: G −→V be an irreducible
representation of a group G with n := dim V < ∞and let L ∈Cn×n commute with all ρ(g):
L ρ(g) = ρ(g) L
∀g ∈G .
Then there exists a λ ∈C such that L = λ 1n×n .

(i = 2), respectively, i.e., ⃗L = ⃗L1 ⊗Id + Id ⊗⃗L2 and analogously for ⃗
M. In the
fundamental representation of SL(2, C) (i.e., (j1, j2) = ( 1
2, 0)) we have
⃗L1 = 1
2⃗σ ,
⃗
M1 = i
2⃗σ ,
(3.2.99)
and in the conjugated representation (i.e., (j1, j2) = (0, 1
2)) it holds that
⃗L2 = 1
2⃗σ ,
⃗M2 = −i
2⃗σ ,
(3.2.100)
where ⃗σ = (σ1, σ2, σ3) denotes the Pauli matrices. So we have
⃗
M1 = i⃗L1 ,
⃗M2 = −i⃗L2 ,
(3.2.101)
and the validity of these relations goes over to all representations πj1,j2, where
j1, j2 ∈1
2N (3.2.98). With that we obtain for the Casimir operators
C0 = (⃗L1 ⊗Id + Id ⊗⃗L2)2 −( ⃗
M1 ⊗Id + Id ⊗⃗M2)2
= 2(⃗L2
1 ⊗Id + Id ⊗⃗L2

j1(j1 + 1) + j2(j2 + 1)

(Id ⊗Id) .
(3.2.103)
We ﬁnd indeed that C0 vanishes on the trivial representation j1 = j2 = 0 only,
that is, on Einv only. However, the kernel of C1 is much bigger. Hence, A = π(C0).
As an example let us consider a Lorentz invariant distribution t0 ∈D′(R4 \
{0}) which scales almost homogeneously with degree D = 6. Let tω be the unique
extension of t0 to D′
ω (3.2.23), where ω = D −4 = 2; tω is also Lorentz invariant
since it is a direct extension (3.2.22) of t0. An extension t of t0 to D′(R4) which
maintains the almost homogeneous scaling with degree D = 6, is obtained by the
improved Epstein–Glaser renormalization, see Lemma 3.2.19:
t = tω ◦W ,

 Ca ∈C} ⊂D′(R4). Using (3.2.102), this can be done
by ﬁnding the irreducible subrepresentations of the representation of the Lorentz

the problem, hence we extend R0

Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Following [55, App. C] (which is based on lecture notes of K. Fredenhagen
[73]), the idea is to use the K¨all´en–Lehmann spectral representation [111, 123]:
Generally, the latter is a representation of the two-point function of any quantum
ﬁeld (which may be an interacting ﬁeld) as a “weighted sum” of free propagators
with diﬀerent masses m; more precisely, this sum is an integral over m2 with a
measure f(m2) dm2 on [0, ∞), where f is a suitable weight function or distribution.
In the following we will need the K¨all´en–Lehmann representation only for the ﬁelds
ϕ2 and ϕ3 of the massless, free theory: Below we prove that there exist weight
functions f2 and f3 such that

(3.2.112) into the deﬁnition of jk, we get
jk(y) = −i

dm2 fk(m2) Δm(y)
(3.2.113)
Considering jk(y) θ(−y0), we are tempted to use Δm(y) θ(−y0) = −Δret
m (−y) in
the integrand. However, a trick will be needed to ensure convergence of the result-
ing m2-integration.
To compute the weight functions f2 and f3 (3.2.112), we ﬁrst derive the
K¨all´en–Lehmann representation for Δ+
m1(y) D+(y) , m1 ≥0. We write

To compute the integral for ˜fm1(m2), we may choose q = (m,⃗0 ) and ﬁrst perform
the integrations over the energies p0

Now, if we replace Δm(y) in (3.2.113) by −Δret
m (−y), then the m2-integral
becomes UV-divergent. Using fk(m2) ∼m2k−4, an indication of this diﬀerent
behaviour is that in momentum space the integral
	 ∞
0
dm2 m2k−4 ˆΔm(p) exists, but
	 ∞
0
dm2 m2k−4 ˆΔret
m (−p) diverges,
where k = 2, 3. However, for y ̸= 0 (or more correctly, on D(R4 \ {0})) we have
−Δret
m (−y) = Δm(y) if y0 ≤0, and −Δret
m (−y) = 0 if y0 ≥0. Hence we may write

(3.2.116)
Note that r0
k scales homogeneously: ρ2k r0
k(ρy) = r0
k(y).
For k = 2, let μ > 0 be an arbitrary mass scale; we deﬁne
r2 μ(y) :=

0
dm2 Δret
m (−y)
m2 + μ2 ,
(3.2.117)
which exists as a distribution in D′(R4), since the m2-integral is ﬁnite. For y ̸= 0
the operator (□y −μ2) may be applied before the m2-integration and we obtain
r0
2(y) (3.2.116), i.e., r2 μ is an extension of r0
2. To avoid an IR-divergence of the m2-
integral, we need to introduce a scale μ > 0, which breaks homogeneous scaling,
due to
ρ4r2 μ(ρy) = r2 ρμ(y).
We still have to check the Sm-expansion axiom, i.e., that r2 μ scales almost homo-
geneously with degree D = 4. According to Proposition 3.2.16, the power of the
almost homogeneous scaling should be N = 1, i.e.,
(ρ ∂ρ + 4)2 r2 μ(ρy) = 0.

Hence, (3.2.118) is indeed satisﬁed for all μ > 0. So we obtain explicitly the break-
ing of homogeneous scaling by computing only elementary integrals, i.e., without
really computing the integral (3.2.117) – this is a main advantage of the renor-
malization method used here. As a byproduct, the calculation (3.2.119) shows
explicitly that the choice of μ > 0 is precisely the choice of the indeterminate
parameter C in the general solution r2(y) + C δ(y).
In the case k = 3 we proceed analogously to k = 2: By the same arguments
as above, one veriﬁes that

Exercise 3.2.32. Setting μ1 = μ2 =: μ in the formula for r3 μ1,μ2, show that the breaking
of homogeneous scaling is
ρ6r3 μ,μ(ρy) −r3 μ,μ(y) =

(3.2.120)
[Solution: The l.h.s. of (3.2.120) is equal to (r3 ρμ,ρμ −r3 μ,ρμ) + (r3 μ,ρμ −r3 μ,μ); to
compute each of these two brackets we use the method (3.2.119).]
We see that r3 μ,μ violates almost homogeneous scaling with degree 6; and by
a generalization of Exer. 3.2.32, one ﬁnds that this holds true even for all r3 μ1,μ2
with (μ1, μ2) ∈R+ × R+. However, from the result (3.2.120) we read oﬀthat
r3 C(y) := r3 μ,μ(y) −
1
32 (2π)4 μ2 δ(y) + C □δ(y),
(3.2.121)
where C ∈R is arbitrary, fulﬁlls our requirements. The prescription (3.2.121)
is the most general solution which is additionally Lorentz-invariant and respects
axiom (g) (∗-structure). For the breaking of homogeneous scaling, we obtain
ρ6r3 C(ρy) −r3 C(y) =
−1
16 (2π)4 log ρ □δ(y).
(3.2.122)
A general feature of massless models shows up in the scaling results (3.2.119)
and (3.2.122): The breaking of homogeneous scaling is independent of the nor-
malization (i.e., of the choice of μ in (3.2.117) and C in (3.2.121)), because the
undetermined polynomial 
|a|=D−k Ca ∂aδ(k)(y) scales homogeneously.
Remark 3.2.33. The expressions r2 and r3 diﬀer from r(ϕ2, ϕ2) and r(ϕ3, ϕ3)
(3.1.41) by combinatorial factors and powers of ℏ: Using (2.1.5) we ﬁnd
r(ϕ2, ϕ2)(y) = 2! ℏ2 r2(y),
r(ϕ3, ϕ3)(y) = 3! ℏ3 r3(y).

(3.2.126)
The non-uniqueness lies in the choice of the parameters μ > 0 in r2 μ and C ∈R
in r3 C.
If we do not require the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation axiom, formula (3.2.126) still
gives a solution of all other axioms. But, in this case R2,1(ϕ4 ⊗ϕ4, ϕ) contains a
further non-uniqueness: We may add a term
C1 ℏ4 δ(x1 −x, x2 −x) ϕ(x)
to (3.2.126), because

Dret(x −x1) r3 C(x2 −x1)

extension with these properties is obtained by adding a term C( m1

is an arbitrary function of m1
m2 .
Note that the limit m1, m2 →0, with
m1
m2 = constant, of r(m1,m2)(y) + C( m1

diverges, due to an IR-divergence of the m2-integral. Therefore, r(m1,m2)(y)+C( m1

violates the Sm-expansion axiom for any C( m1
m2 ).]

The time-ordered product
159
Remark 3.2.35. The observation made in this exercise is of general validity (cf. [65,
Remk. 6.1]): For r(m)(A1, . . . , An)(X) ∈D′(Rd(n−1)) with 
j dim Aj ≥d(n −1)
(where A1, . . . , An are monomials) the Sm-expansion axiom is not compatible
with homogeneous scaling under (X, m) →(ρX, m/ρ) for the following reason: If
r(m)(A1, . . . , An) would have both properties, the distribution r(m=0)(A1, . . . , An)
would be well deﬁned in D′(Rd(n−1)) and it would scale homogeneously under
X →ρX; in general this is impossible, as we know from the proof of Proposition
3.2.16 (Exer. 3.2.18).
3.3
The time-ordered product
References for this section are [12, 24, 66, 131, 148] and [55, App. E].
Mostly, pQFT is formulated in terms of time-ordered products. Compared
with the retarded products, they have the advantage that they are symmetric in
all their arguments – this simpliﬁes their computation. Since our main techniques
to renormalize – diﬀerential renormalization and analytic regularization – work
for both retarded and time-ordered products,63 we ﬁrst introduce time-ordered
products and then explain these methods (Sect. 3.5).
3.3.1
Heuristic explanation of the physical relevance
of the time-ordered product
The retarded products are the coeﬃcients in the Taylor expansion of the interact-
ing ﬁelds with respect to the coupling constant κ; analogously, the time-ordered
products of the interaction are the coeﬃcients in the Taylor expansion (also with
respect to κ) of the S-matrix. On a very heuristic level, the latter statement
can be explained by analogy to the interaction picture of quantum mechanics
(cf. [77, Sect. 2.4]): Let κHint(t) and ψ(t) ≡ψ(t, ⃗x) be the interaction Hamilton-
ian and the wave function, respectively, at time t, both in the interaction picture.
Introducing the time evolution operator U(t, t0) by
U(t, t0) ψ(t0) := ψ(t) ,
∀t, t0 ∈R , ∀ψ ,
the time evolution equation in the interaction picture (“Schwinger-Tomonaga
equation”), which is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger equation in the Schr¨odinger
picture, can be written as
iℏ∂
∂tU(t, t0) = κ Hint(t) U(t, t0) .
63This hold also for the renormalization method relying on the K¨all´en–Lehmann representation
explained in the preceding section.

appearing on the r.h.s. of (3.3.2) translates into the star product, because it is the
star product which corresponds to the product of Fock space operators (Theorem
2.6.3).
But formula (3.3.3) is ill deﬁned due to three kinds of divergences; the ﬁrst
two can be avoided by the Epstein–Glaser construction [66] (also called “causal
perturbation theory”). More in detail:
• UV-divergences: Since [Lint(xi), Lint(xj)]⋆= 0 for (xi −xj)2 < 0, the naive
“deﬁnition” (3.3.4) of the time-ordered product works if xi ̸= xj ∀1 ≤i <
j ≤n (i.e., (3.3.4) is well deﬁned as an F-valued distribution on D( ˇMn), see
64We ignore divergences of the integral appearing for |⃗x| →∞.

3.3.
The time-ordered product
161
(3.1.68) for the deﬁnition of ˇMn), and it is even Lorentz covariant – cf. Lemma
3.3.2 below. But formula (3.3.4) is in general divergent for coinciding points,
xi = xj for some i < j (i.e., (3.3.4) is ill deﬁned on D(Mn)). We solve this UV-
problem analogously to our construction of the R-product R ≡(Rn,1)n∈N:
We construct the sequence (Tn)n∈N∗by induction on n and take into account
translation invariance. In each inductive step UV-divergences can be avoided
by a rigorous extension of the relevant distributions from D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0})
to D′(Rd(n−1)); that is, the results and techniques explained in Sects. 3.2.2
and 3.5 solve the UV-problem (“renormalization”) also for the time-ordered
product.
• IR-divergences: The integral in (3.3.3) is in general divergent for ∥xj∥→∞
for some j. As we do in the construction of the R-product, we multiply the
coupling constant κ by a spacetime-dependent test function g(x) with com-
pact support. Having solved the UV-problem as explained above, the integral
in (3.3.3) becomes then the application of the distribution Tn

Lint(x1)⊗· · ·⊗
Lint(xn)

∈D′(Mn, F) to the test function g(x1) · · · g(xn) ∈D(Mn).
• Divergence of the series : Generally the sum over n in (3.3.3) is divergent.
Our way out is to interpret this sum as a formal power series, similarly to
the perturbation series for the interacting ﬁelds (3.1.2).
Having “cured” formula (3.3.3) as sketched, S ≡S(g) is a well-deﬁned element of
F[[κ]].
3.3.2
Axioms for the time-ordered product and
its inductive construction
Basic axioms. Similarly to the retarded product R ≡(Rn,1)n∈N, we deﬁne the
time-ordered product T ≡(Tn)n∈N∗by basic axioms and additional axioms called
“renormalization conditions”.

and the renormalization conditions (axioms (v)–(x)) given below.
The T -products Tn

A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)

with A1, . . . , An ∈P, appearing
in the Causality axiom, are deﬁned analogously to (3.1.3)–(3.1.4). Similarly to
Remk. 3.1.1, the dependence of the T -products only on (local) functionals is equi-
valent to the AWI:
∂xlT (· · · ⊗A(xl) ⊗· · · ) = T (· · · ⊗∂xlA(xl) ⊗· · · ),
A ∈P .
(3.3.6)
The four properties listed in Deﬁnition 3.3.1 are the basic axioms for time-
ordered products. Notice that the mass m (i.e., the information about the free
ﬁeld equation) appears only in the Causality axioms.
The Causality axiom is a rigorous and explicitly Lorentz covariant formula-
tion of “time-ordering”; it is very restrictive. A ﬁrst simple consequence is that
Tn

A1(x1), . . . , An−1(xn−1), c

= c · Tn−1

A1(x1), . . . , An−1(xn−1)

(3.3.7)
for all c ∈C, A1, . . . , An−1 ∈P; this result diﬀers signiﬁcantly from the corres-
ponding statement for retarded products given in Remk. 3.1.4. To derive (3.3.7)
we write c as c = A(x) where x ∈M is arbitrary. Choosing x suitably, the
causal factorization (3.3.5) yields Tn

A1(x1), . . . , c

= c ⋆Tn−1

A1(x1), . . .

=
c · Tn−1

A1(x1), . . .

.
An important consequence of the Causality axiom is that the two factors on
the right-hand side of (3.3.5) commute under the ⋆-product if (xπ(l) −xπ(j))2 <
0 ∀1 ≤l ≤k < j ≤n; this property is called spacelike commutativity.
It is remarkable that the axioms Causality and Initial condition determine
T (m)
n

A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)

uniquely if xl ̸= xj ∀l < j. In detail and in rigorous
terms, the statement reads as follows:
Lemma 3.3.2 (Consequences of Causality). Let ˇMn := { (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Mn 

 xl ̸=
xj ∀1 ≤l < j ≤n }.
(a) Roughly speaking, the time-ordered product Tn(A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)) can be
expressed as a multiple ⋆-product on D( ˇMn). This can be done as follows:
For any permutation π ∈Sn the set65
Uπ :=

(x1, . . . , xn)


 xπ(j) /∈

{xπ(j+1), . . . , xπ(n)} + V −

∀1 ≤j ≤n −1

65In the deﬁnition of the set Uπ we take into account that (x1 /∈x2 + V −) ∧(x2 /∈x3 + V −)
does not imply x1 /∈x3 + V −.

3.3.
The time-ordered product
163
is an open subset of ˇMn and {Uπ


 π ∈Sn} is an open cover of ˇMn:

π∈Sn
Uπ = ˇMn .
On D(Uπ) it holds that
T (m)
n

A1(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗An(xn)

= Aπ(1)(xπ(1)) ⋆m · · · ⋆m Aπ(n)(xπ(n)) (3.3.8)
for all A1, . . . , An ∈P. This formula is consistent in the sense that
Aπ(1)(xπ(1)) ⋆m · · · ⋆m Aπ(n)(xπ(n)) = Aσ(1)(xσ(1)) ⋆m · · · ⋆m Aσ(n)(xσ(n))
(3.3.9)
on D(Uπ) ∩D(Uσ) for all π, σ ∈Sn.
(b) On D( ˇMn) the time-ordered product T (m)
n
agrees with the n-fold product ⋆ΔF
m,
where ⋆ΔF
m is deﬁned by replacing Hm in formula (2.1.5) by the Feynman
propagator ΔF
m (2.3.8), analogously to the procedure in Remk. 2.3.3:
T (m)
n

A1(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗An(xn)

= A1(x1) ⋆ΔF
m · · · ⋆ΔF
m An(xn)
on D( ˇMn)
(3.3.10)
for all A1, . . . , An ∈P.
The r.h.s. of (3.3.10) is called the “unrenormalized time-ordered product”. Accor-
ding to (3.3.10) and Linearity, it is deﬁned on the space
#
{ F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn ∈F⊗n
loc


 supp Fl ∩supp Fj = ∅∀1 ≤l < j ≤n }
$
(3.3.11)
where [−] denotes the linear span. The problem that the choice p = ΔF
m does not
ﬁt into the deﬁnition of ⋆p : F × F −→F (given in Exer. 2.3.1) because ΔF
m is
not smooth, is circumvented here by the restriction of F1 ⋆ΔF · · · ⋆ΔF Fn to the
space (3.3.11); this diﬀers from the restriction to F⊗n
reg used in the deﬁnition of τn
(2.3.10) in Remk. 2.3.3.
Proof. Ad (a): It is quite easy to verify the geometrical statements about the sets
Uπ. Formula (3.3.8) is obtained by iterated use of the causal factorization (3.3.5),
taking into account also the axiom (ii) (Initial condition):
Tn

A1(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗An(xn)

= Aπ1(xπ1) ⋆Tn−1

Aπ2(xπ2) ⊗· · · ⊗Aπn(xπn)

= Aπ1(xπ1) ⋆Aπ2(xπ2)) ⋆Tn−2

Aπ3(xπ3) ⊗· · · ⊗Aπn(xπn)

= · · · ,
where we write πj for π(j) and ⋆for ⋆m. The relation (3.3.9) follows immediately
from the proof of part (b): On D(Uπ) ∩D(Uσ) both sides of (3.3.9) are equal to
A1(x1) ⋆ΔF · · · ⋆ΔF An(xn).
Ad (b):
Due to the commutativity of the product ⋆ΔF
m and due to ΔF
m(x) =

m(x) for x /∈V −(see (2.3.9)), the r.h.s. of (3.3.10) agrees with the r.h.s. of

Remark 3.3.3 (UV-divergences and UV-regularization). Trying to interpret the
unrenormalized T -product (3.3.10) as a distribution in D′(Mn, F) (or the un-
renormalized R-product (3.1.69) as a distribution in D′(Mn+1, F)) one meets the
well-known UV-divergences of perturbative QFT. For example, for d = 4 the
powers ΔF
m(xi −xj)k , k ≥2, exist on D( ˇMn) (because ΔF
m(z) = Δ+
m(z) or
ΔF
m(z) = Δ+
m(−z) for z ̸= 0, due to (2.3.9)), but they do not exist for coinciding
points, i.e., on D(Mn).
In terms of the explicit formula (A.3.5) for WF(ΔF
m) and H¨ormander’s crite-
rion (Theorem A.3.3) the existence of (ΔF
m)k can be discussed as follows:
– The wave front set of ΔF
m restricted to D(Rd \ {0}) is given by the sec-
ond set in the set union on the r.h.s. of (A.3.5). From this we see that
WF(ΔF
m|D(Rd\{0})) ⊕WF(ΔF
m|D(Rd\{0})) = WF(ΔF
m|D(Rd\{0})).
Proceeding by induction on k we conclude that (ΔF
m)k|D(Rd\{0}) exists and
WF(ΔF
m)k|D(Rd\{0}) = WF(ΔF
m|D(Rd\{0})), cf. Exer. 2.2.1(b).
– But, for x = 0 the H¨ormander criterion is not fulﬁlled, already for k = 2,
because

{0} × (Rd \ {0})

⊂WF(ΔF
m).
A widespread method to overcome the UV-divergences is to regularize the
unrenormalized T -product (3.3.10) by an UV-cutoﬀΛ. Let TΛ

⊗n
j=1Aj(xj)

But, on D(Mn) the cutoﬀcannot be removed directly, more explicitly, the limit
limΛ→∞TΛ

⊗n
j=1Aj(xj)

diverges in general. Therefore, one adds suitable, local
“counter terms” NΛ

∈D′(Mn, F) (which diverge for Λ →∞), such
that the limit

exists in
D′(Mn, F) .

In the framework of the inductive Epstein–Glaser construction of the T -
product (or R-product), we develop the following UV-regularization methods:
• An analytic regularization to explicitly compute the extension of almost ho-
mogeneously scaling distributions, i.e., to solve the extension problem of
Proposition 3.2.16 in practice; this method is given in Sect. 3.5.2.
• Regularization of the Feynman propagator: an UV-regularization of the un-
renormalized T -product (3.3.10) is obtained by replacing ⋆ΔF
m by ⋆pΛ (intro-
duced in Exer. 2.3.1), where (pΛ)Λ>0 is a family of smooth functions with
limΛ→∞pΛ = ΔF
m in an appropriate sense. This is the starting point for
Sect. 3.9. For this regularization method, Theorem 3.9.4 shows that the ad-
dition of local counter terms (3.3.12) can consistently be done to obtain a
time-ordered product T ≡(Tn)n∈N∗solving our axioms.
However, we emphasize: Epstein–Glaser renormalization is well deﬁned without
any regularization or divergent counter terms. We introduce these devices only as
a method for practical computation of the extension of distributions (see Sect. 3.5.2
about analytic regularization), or to be able to mimic Wilson’s renormalization
group (see Sect. 3.9).
Remark 3.3.4 (Feynman diagrams for time-ordered products). Similarly to the
R-product (Sect. 3.1.7), we understand by a (Feynman) diagram for a T -product
Tn

⊗n
j=1Aj(xj)

a contraction scheme for the corresponding unrenormalized ex-
pression (3.3.10). For example, the diagram

Inner lines are not oriented, since ΔF (−z) = ΔF (z). A diagram Γ1 is called
a “subdiagram” of the diagram Γ if and only if all vertices and all (inner and
external) lines of Γ1 are also vertices and lines of Γ; we write
Γ1 ⊆Γ

for this. An example is given by the ﬁsh diagram and the setting sun diagram
(introduced in (3.2.124), however here understood as diagrams for the unrenor-
malized T -product): The former is a subdiagram of the latter.
The “Feynman rules” are rules by which one can read oﬀfrom a diagram the
corresponding analytical, “unrenormalized” expression (inclusive of all signs and
combinatorial factors) contributing to the r.h.s. of (3.3.10).
Example 3.3.5. From part (b) of the lemma we conclude that

For this particular example, the product ⋆ΔF
m (i.e., the r.h.s.) is well deﬁned on the whole
space D(M2) and gives a solution of the basic axioms.
Properties of the Feynman propagator. Motivated by (3.3.10), we derive some
basic properties of the Feynman propagator in the following exercise. The wave
front set of ΔF

Inductive construction of the time-ordered product. According to Lemma 3.3.2,
the basic axioms determine Tn uniquely on D( ˇMn). An even stronger statement
holds true: Given T1, . . . , Tn−1, the basic axioms determine Tn uniquely on the
larger space D(Mn \Δn). For this inductive construction of T 0
n := Tn|D(Mn\Δn) we
refer to [138], more details are given in unpublished notes of Raymond Stora67from
67Actually, Raymond Stora told us that this method was ﬁrst proposed by H. Epstein.

The time-ordered product

1993 [158], and we also refer to [24, 131]. The basic idea is to work with an
open cover {CI


 I as explained below} of Mn \ Δn, which is such that on each
D(CI) the time-ordered product T 0
n is uniquely determined by causal factorization
(3.3.5) in terms of time-ordered products of lower orders. More explicitly: For each
I ⊂{1, . . . , n} with I ̸= ∅and I ̸= {1, . . ., n} let
CI := {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈Mn 

 xi /∈(xj + V −) ∀i ∈I, j ∈Ic}
(3.3.15)
(where Ic := {1, . . . , n} \ I), which is an open subset of Mn \ Δn. One veriﬁes that

I
CI = Mn \ Δn .
(3.3.16)
On D(CI) the Causality axiom determines T 0
n uniquely in terms of T1, . . . , Tn−1:

on
D(CI) .
(3.3.17)
However, if CI1 ∩CI2 ̸= ∅, the prescription (3.3.17) gives two diﬀerent deﬁnitions
of T 0
n on D(CI1 ∩CI2); one checks compatibility, that is, that these two deﬁnitions
are equal. This construction is quite analogous to the inductive construction of
R0
n−1,1 given in Sect. 3.2.1; similarly to (3.2.13) it has the disadvantage that in
general a closed formula for T 0
n needs a partition of unity:68

fI ∈C∞(Mn \ Δn, R) ,
1 =

I
fI(x) ∀x ∈Mn \ Δn
and
supp fI ⊆CI .
(3.3.19)
We point out that this result for T 0
n does not depend on the choice of the family
{fI}, due to the compatibility of (3.3.17) on D(CI1 ∩CI2). The use of a partition of
unity can be avoided by working with the distribution splitting method of Epstein
and Glaser [66, 148] (see also Exer. 3.5.7), on the price of a more complicated
combinatorics.
Similarly to the inductive construction of Rn−1,1 ∈D′(Mn) (Sects. 3.2.2–
3.2.7), renormalization is then the extension D′(Mn \ Δn) ∋T 0
n →Tn ∈D′(Mn)
which is restricted by further axioms – the renormalization conditions for the time-
ordered product. The latter correspond 1 : 1 to the renormalization conditions for
the retarded product (axioms (f)–(l) in Sect. 3.1).
68An example, for which a partition of unity cannot be avoided, is given in Remk. 3.5.20. For
this example, a suitable partition of unity is explicitly constructed, by a method which seems to
be of general applicability.

Renormalization conditions. These additional axioms for the T -product read:
(v) Field independence: δTn/δϕ = 0 , or more explicitly
δTn(F ⊗n)
δϕ(x)
= n Tn
 δF
δϕ(x) ⊗F ⊗(n−1)
.
Similarly to the R-product, this axiom is equivalent to the requirement that
Tn satisﬁes the causal Wick expansion (3.1.23) or (3.1.24).
(vi) ∗-structure and ﬁeld parity: Field parity is the condition
α ◦Tn = Tn ◦α⊗n ,
where α is deﬁned in (1.10.6); the formulation of the ∗-structure condition is
given below in (3.3.29), since the necessary tools are not yet introduced.

; however, in
contrast to (3.3.10), there is no restriction of the domain here – this ⋆ΔF -product
exists for all g and for all F1, . . . , Fn−1, since there is at most one contraction.
(ix) Sm-expansion: For all monomials A1, . . . , An ∈P, the distributions

The time-ordered product
169
Example 3.3.7. Let d = 4. The aim of this example is to compute T3(ϕ ⊗ϕ2 ⊗ϕ) on
D(M3) without requiring the axiom (viii) (Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation). Applying (3.3.10) we
obtain the restriction of this time-ordered product to D( ˇM3):
T3

+ 2 ℏ2 ΔF

(3.3.22)
To show that this formula holds even on D(M3\Δ3) we verify relation (3.3.17) for formula
(3.3.22) for all I. E.g., for I = {2, 3} it should hold
[r.h.s. of(3.3.22)]
?= T2

ϕ2(x2) ⊗ϕ(x3)

⋆T1(ϕ(x1)) .
(3.3.23)
To verify this, we use formula (3.3.13) for T2(ϕ2 ⊗ϕ); this is allowed because, taking
into account also the relevant renormalization conditions, the solution for T2(ϕ2 ⊗ϕ) is
unique and it is given by (3.3.13). The r.h.s. of (3.3.23) is equal to

ϕ2(x2) ϕ(x3) + 2 ℏΔF (x2 −x3) ϕ(x2)
	
⋆ϕ(x1)
= ϕ2(x2) ϕ(x3) ϕ(x1) + ℏ

ϕ2(x2) Δ+(x3 −x1) + 2 ϕ(x2) ϕ(x3) Δ+(x2 −x1)
+ 2 ΔF (x2 −x3) ϕ(x2) ϕ(x1)
	
+ 2 ℏ2 ΔF (x2 −x3) Δ+(x2 −x1) .
(3.3.24)
Now, for (x1, x2, x3) ∈C{2,3} we have Δ+(xj −x1) = ΔF (x1 −xj) for j = 2, 3, due to
(2.3.8). With that (3.3.24) agrees with the r.h.s. of (3.3.22).
The extension to D(M3) can be done by the direct extension, since the distributions
ΔF (xj −xk) ∈D′(R8 \ {0}) (where j < k) and ΔF (x1 −x2) ΔF (x2 −x3) ∈D′(R8 \ {0})
have scaling degree 2(< 8) and 4(< 8), respectively. We conclude that the solution for
T3(ϕ ⊗ϕ2 ⊗ϕ) ∈D′(M3) is unique and that it is given by formula (3.3.22).
S-matrix as generating functional of the time-ordered product. The main moti-
vation to study the S-matrix is certainly its striking physical relevance for the de-
scription of scattering experiments in elementary particle physics, cf. Sect. 3.3.1.
However, there is also a mathematical motivation: Many properties of the T -
product can be formulated more elegantly in terms of its generating functional,
which is the S-matrix.
Deﬁnition 3.3.8. The S-matrix is deﬁned as
S(F) := 1 +

n=1
in
n! ℏn Tn(F ⊗n) ≡T (eiF/ℏ
⊗
) .
(3.3.25)
In the last expression we use T0(c) := c for c ∈C, and we interpret T as a (linear
and totally symmetric) map
T : T(κFloc) −→F[[κ]] ;

for the notation see (A.1.5)–(A.1.7).

see (A.1.19)–(A.1.22) for the deﬁnition of the nth derivative of S : κFloc −→F[[κ]]

Remark 3.3.9. Let F, G ∼ℏ0. According to (3.1.71), GF = R(eF/ℏ
⊗
, G) is a formal
power series in ℏ. But, S(F) = T (eiF/ℏ
⊗
) is a formal Laurent series in ℏ, because
Tn(F ⊗n) = F · F · · · · · F + O(ℏ) ,
(classical product in the ﬁrst term) due to axiom (x) and the causal Wick expan-
sion (axiom (v)). It is only the connected part of the S-matrix, more precisely
ℏT c(eiF/ℏ
⊗
) (see Deﬁnition 4.4.1), which is a formal power series in ℏ, as explained
after (4.4.4).
The causality axiom for the time-ordered product (3.3.5) can equivalently be
expressed in terms of the S-matrix by the condition:
S(H + G + F) = S(H + G) ⋆S(G)⋆−1 ⋆S(G + F)
if supp H ∩(supp F + V −) = ∅
(3.3.27)
where the notation ⋆−1 denotes the inverse with respect to the ⋆-product; or by
the seemingly weaker condition69 obtained from (3.3.27) by setting G = 0:
S(H + F) = S(H) ⋆S(F)
if
supp H ∩(supp F + V −) = ∅.
(3.3.28)
That this last condition is equivalent to the causal factorization of the time-ordered
product (3.3.5) is veriﬁed in the following exercise.
Exercise 3.3.10 (Equivalence of two Causality conditions). Let maps Tn : F⊗n
loc −→F be
given, satisfying the axioms (i) Linearity and (iii) Symmetry, and let S be deﬁned in
terms of these maps by (3.3.25). Prove that (3.3.5) ⇔(3.3.28).
[Hint: Use the techniques of the proof of (3.1.9) ⇔(3.1.10).]
[Solution. (3.3.5) =⇒(3.3.28): Let H = A(h), F = B(g), with A, B ∈P , h, g ∈D(M)

To complete the proof of the equivalence of the three causality conditions
(3.3.5), (3.3.27) and (3.3.28), it remains to show that (3.3.5) (or (3.3.28)) im-
plies (3.3.27). This proof is more involved, we give it in Exer. 3.3.16 by following
Epstein and Glaser [66, Sect. 8.1].70 Alternatively, a direct proof that (3.3.28) is
indeed equivalent to (3.3.27) in the framework of perturbation theory, can be given
by using the method of [27, App. B].
We point out that the formulation (3.3.27) or (3.3.28) of the causality condi-
tion does not have a direct physical foundation, because switching on and oﬀthe
interaction is unphysical.
By means of the S-matrix, the ∗-structure axiom for the time-ordered product
can be formulated as
S(F)∗= S(F ∗)⋆−1,
for all
F ∈Floc .
(3.3.29)
For a real interaction, F = F ∗, this condition requires that S(F) is unitary.
The validity of the axiom (3.3.29) for the unrenormalized T -product is veriﬁed
in Exer. 3.3.13.
3.3.3
Connection between the T - and the R-product
Let an S-matrix S be given. One may then deﬁne a sequence of maps
Rn,1 : F⊗(n+1)

by linearity, symmetry in the ﬁrst n arguments,
and the Bogoliubov formula:

We are now going to show that the so-deﬁned maps Rn,1 fulﬁll the axioms for the
R-product if S satisﬁes the axioms for the T -product.
70Since this proof uses some tools, which are not yet introduced, we postpone it till the end of
this section.

(a) Derive the causality relation (axiom (d), formula (3.1.9)) for the maps Rn,1 deﬁned

for
K, F ∈Floc .

Prove the causality relation (3.3.27) for SK in place of S, and derive from this
relation spacelike commutativity of SK, i.e., the property

= S(K)⋆−1 ⋆S(K + G + F + H) = SK(G + F + H) .
Setting G := 0 in this relation, we obtain the following: If supp F and supp H are spacelike
separated it holds that
SK(F) ⋆SK(H) = SK(F + H) = SK(H) ⋆SK(F) .]
The maps Rn,1 deﬁned by (3.3.30) fulﬁll also the GLZ relation (axiom (e),
formula (3.1.11a)). The proof of that uses only the deﬁnition (3.3.30) and Linearity
and Symmetry of the T -product – further axioms for the T -product (in particular
Causality) are not needed. The proof can be given as follows [48].

In addition, one veriﬁes easily that the maps Rn,1 deﬁned by (3.3.30) fulﬁll
the renormalization conditions, axioms (f)–(l), if S satisﬁes the corresponding
conditions – only the veriﬁcation of the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation (axiom (j)) is
somewhat more involved, see Exer. 3.3.15 below. We conclude that R := (Rn,1)n∈N
is indeed a retarded product.
Among the axioms for the T -product there is none corresponding to the
GLZ relation. The latter can be interpreted as an integrability condition71 for the
“vector ﬁelds” G −→R(eF
⊗, G), which ensures the existence of a “potential” S(F)
from which R can be recovered by (3.3.30).
To write (3.3.30) as a relation expressing Rn,1 in terms of time-ordered pro-
ducts of diﬀerent orders, we need to express S(F)⋆−1 in terms of time-ordered
products Tl(F ⊗l) for l ∈N∗. For this purpose we deﬁne the antichronological pro-
duct T ≡(T n)n∈N∗to be a sequence of linear maps T n : F⊗n

symmetric in all arguments and given by

regard ωF : G −→iR(eF

whose curvature vanishes if and only if the GLZ relation holds true.

whenever {xπ1, . . . , xπk} ∩

{xπ(k+1), . . . , xπn} + V −

= ∅for a permutation
π ∈Sn. This “anticausal” factorization follows by taking the inverse ⋆−1 of the
causality relation (3.3.28):
S(H + F)⋆−1 = S(F)⋆−1 ⋆S(H)⋆−1
if
supp H ∩(supp F + V −) = ∅. (3.3.36)
Analogously to (3.3.28) ⇔(3.3.5) (Exer. 3.3.10) one proves (3.3.36) ⇔(3.3.35).
With that we conclude that (3.3.5) ⇔(3.3.35).
Note that T n is uniquely determined by T1, . . . , Tn. More precisely, we get
the following relation.

Exercise 3.3.13 (Unrenormalized antichronological product). Let ˇMn be deﬁned as in
Lemma 3.3.2. The “anti-Feynman propagator” is deﬁned by
ΔAF
m (x) := θ(x0) Δ+
m(−x) + θ(−x0) Δ+
m(x) .
(3.3.38)
Due to Δ+
m(x) = Δ+
m(−x), it is related to the Feynman propagator by
ΔAF

and obviously it is symmetric:

factorization (3.3.35), T n fulﬁlls (3.3.8) on D(Uπ) with the factors on the r.h.s. in re-
verse order. This n-fold ⋆-product can be rewritten as an n-fold ⋆ΔAF

m - or
⋆ΔAF
m -product. This yields the assertion, due to (3.3.10) and (3.3.39).]
Now we are ready for the proposition giving the connection between the T -
and the R-product [55].
Proposition 3.3.14 (Duality of T - and R-product).
(a) The Bogoliubov formula (3.3.30) has the following property: Given the ﬁnite
family {T1, . . . , Tn+1} fulﬁlling the axioms (i) (Linearity) and (iii) (Sym-
metry), it determines uniquely the ﬁnite family {R0,1, . . . , Rn,1}, which is
required to fulﬁll the axioms (a) (Linearity) and (b) (Symmetry); and vice
versa.
(b) Given T = (Tn)n∈N∗solving the axioms for the T -product, then the corres-
ponding R = (Rn,1)n∈N constructed according to part (a), fulﬁlls the axioms
for the R-product.
(c) The same statement as part (b), but with the roles of T and R reversed.
So, in this sense, the axioms for the R-product and those for the T - product
are equivalent.
Proof. Ad (a):
Expanding formula (3.3.30) and using Linearity and Symmetry,
we get
Rn,1(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn, G) −in Tn+1(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn ⊗G)
= in

∅̸=I⊆{1,...,n}
(−1)|I| T |I|(FI) ⋆T|Ic|+1(FIc ⊗G) ,
(3.3.41)
where FJ := ⊗j∈JFj for J ⊆{1, . . . , n}. The second term on the left-hand side
corresponds to the case I = ∅. From (3.3.41) we directly see that {T1, . . . , Tn+1}
determines {R0,1, . . . , Rn,1} uniquely. To verify the other direction of the claim,
we proceed by induction on n. So, given {R0,1, . . . , Rn,1}, the family {T1, . . . , Tn}
is known inductively and, hence, this holds also for the right-hand side of (3.3.41),
and in this way we obtain Tn+1.
Ad (b):
This is shown above.

176
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Ad (c):
We give the veriﬁcation of the axioms Symmetry and Causality, for
which the assertion is far from being obvious.
Symmetry72: Obviously, Tn+1(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn ⊗G) constructed inductively by
means of (3.3.41), is symmetrical in F1, . . . , Fn. Hence, it suﬃces to study
in

Expanding this relation, we see that (3.3.43) is equal to minus the term in the last
line of (3.3.42), hence, the r.h.s. of (3.3.42) vanishes.
Causality: Since we have veriﬁed the axiom Symmetry, it suﬃces to consider
the following conﬁguration. Let P ⊆{1, . . ., n} with P ̸= ∅, P c := {1, . . ., n} \
P and assume that xr /∈(xs + V −) ∀r ∈P, s ∈P c ∪{n + 1}. To show the
pertinent causal factorization (3.3.5) of Tn+1, we start with Causality of Rn,1:
Rn,1

A1(x1), . . . , An(xn); An+1(xn+1)

= 0. With that, the Bogoliubov formula
(3.3.41) yields
Tn+1(A1(x1), . . . , An+1(xn+1)) = −

(3.3.44)
72The inductive construction of in Tn+1 as Rn,1 minus the r.h.s. of (3.3.41) agrees essentially
with the procedure in the distribution splitting method of Epstein and Glaser [66, 148] (see
also Exer. 3.5.7). However, in that method the GLZ-relation for the R-product is not taken
into account. Therefore, it may happen that the so-obtained Tn+1 does not fulﬁll the axiom
Symmetry; hence, Epstein and Glaser symmetrize it. This is allowed, because this symmetrization
amounts to the addition of a local term, i.e., a term with support ⊆Δn+1.

Finally, we complete the proof of the equivalence of the three versions (3.3.5),
(3.3.27) and (3.3.28) of the Causality axiom. We use that the causal factorization of
the T -product (3.3.5) implies the anticausal factorization of the T-product (3.3.35),
as explained after (3.3.36).
Exercise 3.3.16 (Generalized retarded product and equivalence of Causality conditions).
In this exercise we prove that (3.3.5) and (3.3.35) imply the (seemingly stronger) causality
condition (3.3.27) by following [66, Sect. 8.1]: We make the same assumptions as in
Exer. 3.3.10. In addition let T be deﬁned by (3.3.34) and let

Rn,l(Gπ(1), . . . , Gπ(n); Fσ(1), . . . , Fσ(l)) = Rn,l(G1, . . . , Gn; F1, . . . , Fl)

In particular we have R0,0 = 1 and for l = 1 the generalized retarded products (Rn,l)n∈N

(b) Show that the relation (3.3.50) is equivalent to the assertion (3.3.27).
[Solution: (a) Analogously to (3.3.30) ⇔(3.3.41), the deﬁnitions (3.3.48) and (3.3.49)

(3.3.51)
by taking into account linearity and symmetry of Rn,l. Now, we replace Gj by Aj(yj)
and Fr by Br(xr), where Aj, Br ∈P. To simplify the notation we write yj for Aj(yj)
and xr for Br(xr); in addition let Y := (y1, . . . , yn) and X := (x1, . . . , xl). With that
formula (3.3.51) can be written as
R(Y ; X) = in 
I⊆Y
(−1)|I| T (I) ⋆T (Ic, X) .
If (Y, X) does not lie in the set given on the r.h.s. of (3.3.50), there are subsets P and Q
of Y such that
P ̸= ∅∧P ∪Q = Y ∧P ∩Q = ∅∧P ∩(X + V −) = ∅∧Q ⊆(X + V −) .
Due to the (anticausal) factorization of T (3.3.5) and T (3.3.35) the following equations
hold true in a neighbourhood of such a point (Y, X) = (P ∪Q, X):
R(Y, X) = in

In the last step we apply (3.3.45), which is allowed since P ̸= ∅.
(b) Similarly to (3.1.9) ⇔(3.1.10), the support property (3.3.50) is equivalent to:

Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Comparison with Exer. 3.3.11(a): In the particular case l = 1, the solution of part
(a) (of the exercise here) is an alternative way to derive the Causality of the R-product
(deﬁned by the Bogoliubov formula (3.3.41)) from the Causality of the T -product, which
is more direct since it uses Causality of the T -product in the original form (3.3.5) and
(3.3.35) instead of (3.3.27). The statement shown in Exer. 3.3.11(a), is part of the equi-
valence veriﬁed in part (b) of the exercise here.
3.4
The time-ordered (or retarded) product
for on-shell ﬁelds
This section is based on references [54] and [20], see also [161].
In the vast majority of the literature (in particular in the work of Epstein
and Glaser [66]), the T - (or R-) product is a map from local Wick polynomials
to Wick polynomials. Roughly speaking, this corresponds to a map from local
on-shell ﬁelds to on-shell ﬁelds in our formalism, due to Theorem 2.6.3. The aim
of this section is to deﬁne a corresponding on-shell T -product in our formalism,
which we denote by T on ≡(T on
n )n∈N∗; the deﬁnition will be given in terms of our
oﬀ-shell version Tn : F⊗n
loc −→F (introduced in Sect. 3.3.2) and it will be such that
the axioms for T ≡(Tn)n∈N∗translate into “nice” properties for T on – essentially
these properties agree with the axioms of Epstein and Glaser used to deﬁne their
on-shell T -product. By proceeding in a completely analogous way, one can deﬁne
also an on-shell R-product Ron ≡(Ron
n,1)n∈N in terms of our oﬀ-shell R-product
(introduced in Sect. 3.1); the Bogoliubov formula (3.3.30) (or (3.3.41)) gives also
the connection between T on and Ron.
3.4.1
Deﬁnition of the on-shell T -product
A crucial point in the deﬁnition of T on are the Remks. 3.1.2 and 3.1.1: Requiring
Linearity and the Field equation for T on, the AWI cannot hold true and, hence,
T on cannot depend only on (local) functionals! Therefore, we deﬁne the arguments
of T on to be (local) on-shell ﬁeld polynomials.
To deﬁne the latter, we introduce the ideal of P generated by the free ﬁeld
equation:
JP =
 
a∈Nd
Ba∂a(□+ m2)ϕ



 Ba ∈P

.
(3.4.1)
Indeed, JP is a 2-sided ideal in P: PJP = JP = JPP. Therefore, the quotient of the
commutative algebra P by the ideal JP,
P0 := P
JP
(3.4.2)

3.4.
The time-ordered (or retarded) product for on-shell ﬁelds
181
is also a commutative algebra – the algebra of “local on-shell ﬁeld polynomials” –
and the canonical surjection
π :

P −→P0
A −→πA := A + JP
(3.4.3)
is an algebra homomorphism, i.e., it is linear and commutes with multiplication:
π(A1A2) = (πA1)(πA2) , ∀A1, A2 ∈P. Derivatives in P0 are deﬁned as follows:
For πA ∈P0 choose a B ∈P such that πB = πA. Then,
∂μ(πA) := π(∂μB)
(3.4.4)
is well deﬁned, since πB1 = πB2 implies (∂μB1 −∂μB2) ∈∂μJP ⊂JP. Note that
the deﬁnition (3.4.4) can also be written as
∂μ(πA) := π(∂μA)
∀A ∈P .
In particular,
(□+ m2)πϕ = π

(□+ m2)ϕ

= 0 ∈P0 ,
because (□+ m2)ϕ ∈JP.
In analogy to F0 := F|C0 ∀F ∈F (2.6.1), we introduce some notations: For
A, A1, . . . , An ∈P we set
A0(x) := A(x)


C0 ,
or equivalently
A0(g) := A(g)0
∀g ∈D(M) ,
(3.4.5)
and
Tn

A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)

0 := Tn

A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)


C0 .
Since
JP = {A ∈P


 A0(x) = 0 ∀x ∈M} ,
(3.4.6)
the map
QP :

P0 −→{A0 : M ∋x →A0(x)


 A ∈P}
πA −→B0
with
B ∈πA ≡A + JP
is a well-deﬁned algebra isomorphism, where the product on the r.h.s. is the point-
wise product w.r.t. both the dependence on x and the dependence on h ∈CS0,
that is,
(A1,0A2,0)(x)(h) := A1,0(x)(h) · A2,0(x)(h) = (A1A2)0(x)(h)
∀x ∈M , h ∈CS0 ,
the second equality is obvious when taking into account (1.3.10). Hence, we indeed
obtain
QP(πA1 · πA2) = QP

π(A1A2)

= (A1A2)0 = A1,0 A2,0 = QP(πA1) QP(πA2) .

182
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
So, we may identify πA with A0 for all A ∈P. The map QP is a version of the
algebra isomorphism Q : F/J −→F0 := F|C0 given in (2.6.3) – the version for
local ﬁeld polynomials.
The main idea of this section is to deﬁne

(3.4.8)
where ξ is an algebra homomorphism73
ξ : P0 −→P ,
(3.4.9)
which chooses a representative of the equivalence class A+JP, that is, ξ(A+JP) ∈
A + JP or equivalently π ◦ξ = Id. In order that the deﬁning axioms for T trans-
late into “nice” properties for T on, we require that ξ satisﬁes certain additional
conditions.
In detail, for the model of one real scalar ﬁeld the map ξ : P0 −→P is deﬁned
by the following axioms:74
(a) πξ = Id.
(b) ξ is an algebra homomorphism.
(c) The Lorentz transformations commute with ξπ: bΛ ◦ξπ = ξπ ◦bΛ ∀Λ ∈L↑
+,
where bΛ is the action of L↑
+ on P, that is, it is deﬁned by (bΛA)(Λx) :=
βΛ A(x) ∀A ∈P, with βΛ given in (3.1.35)–(3.1.36).
(d) ξπ(P1) ⊆P1, where P1 ⊂P is the subspace of ﬁelds linear in ϕ and its partial
derivatives.
(e) ξπ does not increase the mass dimension of the ﬁelds: dim ξπ(A) ≤dim A.
Due to (a), ξπ : P −→P is a projection: (ξπ)(ξπ) = ξπ. From the linearity of ξ
and the condition (a) we conclude that
Ker ξπ = Ker π = JP
(3.4.10)
and, hence,
ξπ□∂aϕ = −m2ξπ∂aϕ
∀a ∈Nd .
(3.4.11)
Since ξ(A + JP) ∈A + JP, we know
ξπ(A) −A ∈JP ,
that is,
ξπ(A)0 = A0
∀A ∈P .
(3.4.12)
73In references [54] and [20] this map is called σ; we use a diﬀerent Greek letter, because σ, or
more precisely σρ, is used in this book to denote a scaling transformation.
74To shorten the notations we write ξπ and πξ for ξ ◦π and π ◦ξ, respectively. We recall the
deﬁnition of the mass dimension of a ﬁeld polynomial (3.2.63).

3.4.
The time-ordered (or retarded) product for on-shell ﬁelds
183
We are now searching the most general solution ξ of the above axioms; that
is, the most general map ξπ, because ξ is uniquely determined by ξπ. Due to (b),
ξπ is an algebra homomorphism; hence, it holds that
ξπ(c) = c
∀c ∈R ⊂P
(3.4.13)
and it suﬃces to determine ξπ(∂aϕ) for all a ∈Nd:
ξπ(A) =

n

a1,...,an
ca1···an ξπ(∂a1ϕ) · · · ξπ(∂anϕ) ,
when A is given by (1.3.9). From (3.4.12) and (d) we conclude that ξπ(∂aϕ) takes
the form
ξπ(∂aϕ) = ∂aϕ +

|b|≤|a|−2
ca
b ∂b(□+ m2)ϕ
with constants
ca
b ∈R ;
(3.4.14)
the upper bound on |b| comes from the condition (e): dim(ξπ∂aϕ) ≤dim(∂aϕ).
We immediately get
ξπ(ϕ) = ϕ
and
ξπ(∂μϕ) = ∂μϕ .
(3.4.15)
We are now going to determine the coeﬃcients ca
b for |a| = 2, 3, by proceed-
ing by induction on |a|. Using additionally Lorentz covariance (c) and invariance
w.r.t. permutations of the Lorentz indices, the ansatz (3.4.14) yields
ξπ(∂μ∂νϕ) = ∂μ∂νϕ + c gμν (□+ m2)ϕ ,
ξπ(∂μ∂ν∂λϕ) = ∂μ∂ν∂λϕ + c1 (gμν∂λ + gμλ∂ν + gνλ∂μ)(□+ m2)ϕ
with unknown coeﬃcients c, c1 ∈R. To determine the latter we contract with gμν
and use gμνgμν = d:
ξπ(□ϕ) = □ϕ + cd (□+ m2)ϕ
ξπ(∂λ□ϕ) = ∂λ□ϕ + c1(d + 2) ∂λ(□+ m2)ϕ
On the other hand we know from (3.4.11) and the lower |a| results (3.4.15) that
ξπ(□ϕ) = −m2 ξπ(ϕ) = −m2 ϕ
ξπ(∂λ□ϕ) = −m2 ξπ(∂λϕ) = −m2 ∂λϕ .
Hence, we end up with
ξπ(∂μ∂νϕ) = ∂μ∂νϕ −gμν
d (□+ m2)ϕ ,
(3.4.16)
ξπ(∂μ∂ν∂λϕ) = ∂μ∂ν∂λϕ −

d + 2 (gμν∂λ + gμλ∂ν + gνλ∂μ)(□+ m2)ϕ .

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
In [54, Sect. 3.2 and App. A] it is shown that in the four-dimensional Min-
kowski space ξπ(∂aϕ) is uniquely determined for all a ∈Nd, that is, the above
axioms have a unique solution ξ. However, this solution for ξπ(∂aϕ) is given there
only by induction on |a|. In [20] this recurrence relation is solved and a fully
explicit expression for ξπ(∂aϕ) in d-dimensions, d arbitrary, is given.

The latter relation is obtained as follows: Recall that B = 

ξπ(A1)(x1) ⋆· · · ⋆ξπ(An)(xn)

From this relation the assertion follows by means of Lemma 3.3.2(a).]
Other models. The deﬁnition of T on (3.4.7)–(3.4.8) is of general validity; how-
ever, for other models the axioms deﬁning the map ξ need to be modiﬁed and
supplemented.
The model of one complex scalar ﬁeld φ (introduced in Exap. 1.3.2) can be
viewed as the model of two real scalar ﬁelds, ϕ1 and ϕ2, given by the real and
imaginary part of φ, that is, φ = ϕ1 + i ϕ2. P, P1 and JP are modiﬁed: P is the
complex ∗-algebra generated by ∂aφ and ∂aφ∗(a ∈Nd). P1 is the subspace of
ﬁelds linear in φ and φ∗and their partial derivatives; and JP is the ideal in P
generated by (□+ m2)φ and (□+ m2)φ∗, hence J∗
P = JP and π(A∗) = π(A)∗. In
addition, the mass dimension is given by dim ∂aφ := dim ∂aφ∗:= d−2
2
+ |a|. With
these explanations, the axioms (a)–(e) are well deﬁned. The axiom
(iia) ξπ(A∗) = ξπ(A)∗, ∀A ∈P ,
is added in order that ξ is a ∗-algebra homomorphism.

3.4.
The time-ordered (or retarded) product for on-shell ﬁelds
185
It follows ξπ(φ) = φ and ξπ(φ∗) = φ∗. Namely, (d) and (e) imply ξπ(φ) =
a φ+b φ∗with unknown a, b ∈C. From (ξπ(φ)−φ) ∈JP we conclude a = 1 , b = 0.
It is not known whether ξ is uniquely determined by these axioms. The most
obvious solution is obtained from the (unique) map ξreal of the real scalar ﬁeld
(treated above) by setting
ξπ(∂aφ) = ξrealπreal(∂aϕ1) + i ξrealπreal(∂aϕ2)

For the model of one Dirac spinor ﬁeld and the model of N gauge ﬁelds
(Aμ
a)a=1,...,N in Feynman gauge (see Sect. 5.1.3), the axioms deﬁning the map ξ
and their solution are worked out in [20], for arbitrary values of the spacetime
dimension d. In the Dirac spinor case the solution is unique.
3.4.2
Properties of the on-shell T -product
Basic axioms. The basic axioms for Tn : F⊗n
loc −→F translate directly into essen-
tially the same properties for T on
n
(3.4.7)–(3.4.8):
(i) Linearity: T on
n
: P⊗n
0
−→D′(Mn, F0) is linear, because ξ, Tn and F ∋F −→
F0 ∈F0 are linear.
(ii) Initial condition:

ξπ(A)(x)

by using (3.4.12) in the last step.
Combining the deﬁnition of T on
n
(3.4.8) with the Symmetry axiom (iii) and the
Causality axiom (iv) for Tn, respectively, we straightforwardly obtain:
(iii) Symmetry: For all τ ∈Sn and A1, . . . , An ∈P it holds that

Renormalization conditions. We turn to the discussion of the renormalization con-
ditions:

∂μA0(x), . . .

[∂μ, ξπ](A)(x), . . .

by using the AWI for Tn. The commutator [∂μ, ξπ] is in general non-
vanishing, e.g., [∂μ, ξπ](∂νϕ) = (gμν/d) (□+ m2)ϕ by using the results
(3.4.15)–(3.4.16). From (3.4.12) we get ∂μξπ(A) −∂μA ∈∂μJP ⊂JP and
ξπ(∂μA) −∂μA ∈JP, hence, [∂μ, ξπ](A) ∈JP.
In the particular case A = ∂aϕ the failure of the AWI can also be
written as

by using again the AWI for Tn, the result ξπ(ϕ) = ϕ and (3.4.14).
So far, the ∗-operation (1.2.7), the ﬁeld parity transformation α (1.10.6), and the
action of the Poincar´e group βΛ,a (3.1.35) are deﬁned only on F; however, in an
obvious way they induce corresponding maps ∗, α, βΛ,a : F0 −→F0:
(F0)∗:= (F ∗)0 ,
α(F0) := (αF)0 ,
βΛ,a(F0) := (βΛ,aF)0 ,
∀F ∈F . (3.4.21)
Concerning the vacuum state ω0, we recall from (2.6.7) that ω0(F0) := ω0(F) for
all F ∈F.
(via) Field parity: The transformation α : F −→F (deﬁned in (1.10.6)) induces a
linear map α : P −→P which may be given by
(αA)(x)(h) := A(x)(−h)
∀h ∈C , A ∈P ,

deﬁned on P0:
α(πA) = αA+αJP = αA+JP = π(αA) ,
that is,
α◦π = π◦α ; (3.4.22)

Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
To discuss the ∗-structure property of T on and the Bogoliubov formula (3.3.41)
for (T on, Ron), we introduce the on-shell S-matrix and its inverse (w.r.t. the star
product) and the on-shell antichronological product T
on ≡(T
on
n )n∈N∗. We ﬁrst
deﬁne the on-shell S-matrix as the generating functional of T on

similarly to T on
n , Son cannot depend only on the local functional A0(g) ≡A(g)0
(3.4.5). Inserting the deﬁnition of T on
n (3.4.8), we obtain the relation to the oﬀ-shell
S-matrix (Deﬁnition 3.3.8):

star product in F0. We recall that the latter is deﬁned by F0 ⋆G0 := (F ⋆G)0 (see
(2.6.4)). Using this deﬁnition and the relation (3.4.29), one veriﬁes easily that

Considering (3.4.31) to nth order in g and taking into account the deﬁnition of

can be derived directly from (3.4.30) by the usual inversion of a formal power
series (cf. (A.1.4)), that is by proceeding as in Exer. 3.3.12.
(vib) ∗-structure: Since the coeﬃcients of the polynomial ξπ(A) ∈P are real, it
holds that (ξπ(A))(g)∗= (ξπ(A))(g). With this and the relations (3.4.31)
and (3.4.29), the axiom S(F)⋆−1 = S(F ∗)∗translates into

In view of the discussion of the renormalization conditions Field independence and
Field equation, we deﬁne the functional derivative in F0 in the same way as in

However, if A is a polynomial in ϕ and ∂μϕ only, that is,
∂A
∂(∂aϕ) = 0
∀|a| ≥2 ,
(3.4.40)
then we know from (3.4.15) that

satisﬁed Field independence and, hence, one can derive the
causal Wick expansion by proceeding similarly to (3.1.23)–(3.1.24). We give a
somewhat shorter derivation: On the r.h.s. of (3.4.8), we ﬁrst use ξπ(Aj) = Aj

for all 1 ≤j ≤n and then we insert the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24) for

0 for all monomials A = A1, . . . , An. Understanding A0
as monomial in {∂aϕ0 | a ∈Nd}, the submonomials (A0) and (A0) can be
deﬁned analogously to (3.1.25) by throughout replacing A by A0 and ∂aϕ by
∂aϕ0. With this and with the assumption (3.4.40), it obviously holds
A0 :=

A

0 = (A0)
and
A0 :=

A

0 = (A0) .
Having clariﬁed this and using that our assumption implies also ξπ(Aj) = Aj,
the relation (3.4.26) yields
t(A1, . . . , An) = ton(A1,0, . . . , An,0) ;
(3.4.45)
that is, we indeed get the causal Wick expansion for T on
n

A1,0(x1), . . .

.
We point out: If A1, . . . , An contain higher derivatives of ϕ (more pre-
cisely, not all of them fulﬁll (3.4.40)), then it may be that T on(A1,0(x1), . . .)
violates Field independence (3.4.43) and the causal Wick expansion (3.4.44)–
(3.4.45). Epstein–Glaser [66] give an axiomatic deﬁnition of an on-shell T -
product,76 T EG
n
: P⊗n
0
−→D′(Mn, F0), in which they require the causal Wick
expansion for T EG
n
as a renormalization condition. So, it may happen that
the renormalization prescriptions for T on and T EG are non-compatible! If one
is interested only in an on-shell T -product, the procedure of Epstein–Glaser
has the crucial advantage that T EG
n

A1,0(x1), . . . , A1,0(x1)

is completely de-
termined by the VEVs {tEG(A1,0, . . . , An,0)(x1−xn, . . .) | Al,0 ⊆Al,0} (where
tEG(· · · ) := ω0

T EG
n
(· · · )

similarly to (3.4.25)) and, hence, formulas (3.4.27)
and (3.4.48) (with tEG in place of ton) can directly be used as formulation of
the axioms ℏ-dependence and Scaling degree for T EG.
(viii) Field equation: Writing (3.4.14) as
ξπ(∂aϕ) =: χ(∂a)ϕ ,
that is,
χ(∂a) := ∂a +

|b|≤|a|−2
ca
b ∂b(□+ m2) ,
the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation for T (3.3.20) translates into the following relation
for T on (3.4.8), by using also the AWI for T (in the ﬁrst step) and (3.4.37)
76More precisely, by T EG we mean here the translation of Epstein–Glaser’s T-product, which
is deﬁned in Fock space, into our functional formalism. This translation is given by the algebra
isomorphism Φ of Theorem 2.6.3, see (A.7.12).

(ix) Scaling degree: In general, the Sm-expansion axiom does not translate into
a simple property of ton (3.4.25)–(3.4.26). Namely, assuming that A is a ﬁeld
monomial, the problem is that in general ξπ(A) is a sum of monomials which
have diﬀerent mass dimensions, that is, ξπ(A) ̸∈Phom, see the examples given
in (3.4.16). (Of course, this problem does not appear if A is a monomial in ϕ
and ∂μϕ only, because then ξπ(A) = A due to (3.4.15).) For this reason we
study here the axiom Scaling degree (3.3.21).
In the following we work with the mass dimension of ﬁeld polynomi-
als and the Scaling degree axiom for ﬁeld polynomials; both are given in
Remk. 3.2.24. Deﬁning the mass dimension in P0 by
dim(πA) ≡dim(A0) := dim

ξπ(A)

,
(3.4.47)
the deﬁning property (e) of ξ says dim(A0) ≤dim A. In particular, for 0 ̸=
A ∈JP, we have ξπ(A) = 0 (3.4.10) and, hence, dim A0 = 0 < dim A.
By using (3.4.26) and the Scaling degree axiom for t

(3.3.41) into the r.h.s. of (3.4.49), using (F ⋆G)0 = F0 ⋆G0 and ﬁnally expressing
T |I| and T|Ic|+1 by T on

(3.4.50)
Analogously to the above procedure for (T, T on), the basic axioms and most
renormalization conditions for R (given in Sect. 3.1) can be translated into cor-
responding nice properties of Ron. Alternatively, one may proceed analogously to
Proposition 3.3.14(b): The above-found properties of T on translate into corres-
ponding properties of Ron by means of the Bogoliubov formula (3.4.50).

Techniques to renormalize in practice
In the traditional literature renormalization is usually done in momentum space.
Since causal perturbation theory is an x-space construction of the R- (or T -) pro-
duct,77 and in view of the generalization to curved spacetimes, the topic of this
section are two important x-space techniques.
Apart from the maintenance of symmetries (investigated in Sect. 3.2.7 and
Chap. 4), we have reduced renormalization to the following mathematical problem
by means of the Sm-expansion axiom:
Problem 3.5.1. Given a distribution t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) which scales almost ho-
mogeneously with degree D ∈C, ﬁnd an extension t ∈D′(Rk) which scales also
almost homogeneously with degree D.
In Proposition 3.2.16 we have answered the existence and uniqueness of solutions
t. A ﬁrst method to explicitly compute t in practice, is given in Sect. 3.2.8, here
we give two further techniques, which are of more general applicability.
3.5.1
Diﬀerential renormalization
Diﬀerential renormalization is due to [78, 120]. It was ﬁrst applied to causal perturbation
theory in [45, 139]; see in particular [86].
The method. Diﬀerential renormalization is a way to trace back the case k ≤
Re D < ∞to the simple case Re D < k, in which the solution of Problem 3.5.1 is
77In the original work of Epstein and Glaser [66], renormalization is a distribution splitting,
which can be interpreted as an extension problem in the sense of Theorem 3.2.8, see Exer. 3.5.7.
This distribution splitting can be solved in momentum space by a dispersion integral [66] – this
is a handy method for concrete computations, as demonstrated in [148].

unique and obtained by the direct extension (3.2.22), that is, the extension is given
by the same formula as the non-extended distribution. The idea is to write t0 as a
derivative of a distribution f 0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) which scales almost homogeneously
with degree D −l < k, where l ∈N∗; more precisely
t0 = Df 0
with
D =

|a|=l
Ca∂a , Ca ∈C ,
and
(x∂x + D −l)N f 0 = 0
(3.5.1)
for N ∈N suﬃciently large, where x∂x := k
r=1 xr∂xr. Let f ∈D′(Rk) be the
direct extension of f 0; from Proposition 3.2.16 we know that f scales also almost
homogeneously with the same degree D −l and the same power. The term
t := Df
(3.5.2)
exists in D′(Rk), since distributions are ∞-times diﬀerentiable. The so-constructed
t is an extension of t0, because for h ∈D(Rk \ {0}) we have Dh ∈D(Rk \ {0})
and with that we get
⟨t, h⟩= ⟨Df, h⟩= (−1)l ⟨f, Dh⟩= (−1)l ⟨f 0, Dh⟩= ⟨Df 0, h⟩= ⟨t0, h⟩.
(3.5.3)
In addition, t scales almost homogeneously with degree D, since
(x∂x + D)N t = (x∂x + D)N Df = D (x∂x + D −l)N f = 0 .
(3.5.4)
The non-uniqueness of t shows up in the non-uniqueness of f 0: One may add
to f 0 a distribution g0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) which scales almost homogeneously with
degree D−l and with Dg0 = 0 on D(Rk \{0}). The direct extension g of g0 (which
scales also almost homogeneously with degree D−l) fulﬁlls supp Dg ⊆{0}, that is,
the addition of g0 can change t (3.5.2) only by a local term. For example let D = k
and D = □(the wave operator in the k-dimensional Minkowski space). Then, g is
of the form: g = αDret+[solution g1 of □g1 = 0 which scales almost homogeneously
with degree k −2] (α ∈C), and this yields tnew := D(f + g) = told −α δ.
Trying to solve Problem 3.5.1 by means of diﬀerential renormalization, the
diﬃcult step is to ﬁnd a distribution f 0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) satisfying the conditions
(3.5.1). A general method to solve this problem is not known. For the extension
from D′(M4 \ {0}) to D′(M4) the following formulas are helpful:
Lemma 3.5.2. In D′(M4 \ {0}) it holds that
1
(x2 −i0)2 = −□x
log(−M 2(x2 −i0))
4 (x2 −i0)
,
(3.5.5)
where M > 0 is an arbitrary mass (which is needed in order that the argument of
the logarithm is dimensionless), and [122]
□x(x2 −i0)α = 4α(α + 1) (x2 −i0)α−1
∀α ∈C
(also valid in D′(M4 \ {0}))
(3.5.6)
and the same formulas for (x2 −ix00) in place of (x2 −i0).

3.5.

195
These formulas can be veriﬁed by straightforward computation of the deriva-
tives. As we see from (A.2.10), the negative, integer powers of (x2 −i0) and
(x2 −ix00) are relevant for the renormalization of DF (x)n and r0(ϕn, ϕn)(x) ∼

D+(x)n −D+(−x)n
θ(−x0), respectively; for the latter problem see Exer. 3.5.7.
Remark 3.5.3. [27, App. C] Formula (3.5.5) and its generalization to D′(Md \{0}),
where d ≥4 is even, can be derived systematically by proceeding in the following
way: Setting X := −(x2 −i0) we search a distribution F(X) such that
□x F(X) = X−d

a ﬁrst integration can easily be done:

(3.5.8)
where M > 0 and a ∈C are arbitrary, the choice of M and a is the choice of the
integration constant. For the second integration we make the ansatz
F(X) = −C log(M 2X)
X
d

.
Comparing
F ′(X) = −C 1 + (1 −d

with (3.5.8), we see that (3.5.7) is solved if we choose C =

Examples and applications. The ﬁrst example is an application of diﬀerential re-
normalization by means of Lemma 3.5.2, and it is also an application of the Sm-
expansion axiom – we use the stronger version of this axiom, i.e., the addition (k′)
given in Sect. 3.2.6.
Example 3.5.4 (Setting sun diagram for m ≥0 in d = 4 dimensions). Cf. [64, Sect. 6].
The setting sun diagram is given in (3.2.124). For a change we work with time-ordered
products. We have to extend
tm 0
ss (x) = ΔF
m(x)3 ∈D′(M4 \ {0}) ,
x := x1 −x2 ,
(3.5.10)
where ΔF
m is the Feynman propagator (2.3.8). We omit a combinatorial prefactor and
factors ℏ, which are contained in the term belonging to the setting sun diagram. Using

exercise, and M > 0 is a mass scale. Inserting (3.5.11) into (3.5.10) we obtain the
Sm-expansion (3.1.62) of tm 0
ss ; in order that the direct extension can be applied to the
remainder we choose it such that it has scaling degree = 2:

The property that only even powers of m appear, goes over from (3.5.11) to (3.5.12).
The non-direct, almost homogeneous extensions of u0
0(x), u0
2,0 and u0
2,1 can be com-
puted by using diﬀerential renormalization – as renormalization mass scale we use the
same mass M as in the Sm-expansion (3.5.12):
u0(x) = a3 □x□x

(3.5.13)
where C, C0, C1 ∈C are arbitrary constants, in particular they do not depend on m.
These formulas have to be understood as follows: For x ̸= 0 (i.e., on D(M4 \ {0}))
the derivatives can straightforwardly be computed by means of formulas (3.5.5)–(3.5.6)
and we obtain the corresponding u0
...-distributions. In addition, the expressions in

. . .

-
brackets scale almost homogeneously with degree 2. Hence, the assumptions (3.5.1) are
satisﬁed. The overline denotes the direct extension. So formulas (3.5.13) are examples
for (3.5.2). Homogeneous scaling of u0
2,1 and u0
0 is broken, and the power of the almost
homogeneous scaling of u0
2,0 is increased from 1 to 2.
We end up with the following result for the renormalized setting sun diagram:

strong version of the Sm-expansion axiom, homogeneous scaling of the unrenormalized
distribution,

of the renormalization constant C1 (introduced in (3.5.13)) is written explicitly.
Note that choosing M := m for both, the mass scale of the Sm-expansion and the
renormalization mass scale, homogeneous scaling is preserved, because then the mass
scale is also scaled:
ρ6 tm/ρ, m/ρ
ss
(ρx) = tm, m
ss

(3.5.16)
But this choice violates the Sm-expansion axiom, because tm,m

diverges for m ↓0 – this
is a further example for Remk. 3.2.35.
The non-uniqueness of (3.5.14) reads:

work with the weaker version of the Sm-expansion axiom (axiom (k) without (k′)), the
term C □xδ(x) would not be changed, but (C0 + C1 log m
M ) would be replaced by an
arbitrary polynomial in log m
M .

Exercise 3.5.7 (Diﬀerential renormalization for the distribution splitting method). The
distribution splitting method of Epstein and Glaser [66] is a construction of the time-
ordered product (Tn)n∈N∗by induction on n. In the inductive step from n to (n + 1),
renormalization amounts to the following problem for the coeﬃcients in the causal Wick
expansion: Let j ∈D′(Rdn) be given with supp j ⊆

(V +)×n ∪(V −)×n
and let j scale
almost homogeneously with degree D. Find a splitting
j = r −a ,
r, a ∈D′(Rdn) ,
such that
supp r ⊆(V −)×n , supp a ⊆(V +)×n
(3.5.23)
and that r and a scale also almost homogeneously with degree D.
For simplicity we study only the inductive step from n = 1 to 2. For this value of n,
the splitting problem (3.5.23) agrees with the renormalization problem in our construc-
tion of the retarded product R1,1 from R0,1, since the latter can be interpreted as the
splitting problem ℏj0,2(y) = r1,1(y)−r1,1(−y) for a given j0,2 with supp j0,2 ⊆(V +∪V −)
and an r1,1 being searched for with supp r1,1 ⊆V −, see Sect. 3.1.2. However, we point out
that for higher n, the splitting problem resulting from the GLZ relation and Causality
(axioms (e) and (d)), explicitly ℏjn−1,2(y1, . . . , yn−1; yn) = rn,1(y1, . . . , yn)−rn−1,1(y1 −
yn, . . . , yn−1 −yn, −yn), diﬀers from the splitting problem (3.5.23) – the support prop-
erties are diﬀerent.
(a) Show that
r0(y) := j(y) θ(−y0)
and
a0 := r0 −j
solve the splitting problem (3.5.23) in D′(Rd \ {0}).
With that the splitting problem is traced back to ﬁnding an extension r ∈D′(Rd) of
r0 which preserves the almost homogeneous scaling. The pertinent a ∈D′(Rd) is then
obtained by a := r −j.
(b) Assume we have found a J ∈D′(Rd) which scales almost homogeneously with
degree
D −l < d
and with
supp J ⊂(V + ∪V −)
and
j = D J
on

(3.5.24)
exists in D′(Rd) and is an extension of r0 with the required scaling property. (The

j(y) :=

Y := y2 −iy00 ,
where M > 0 is a mass scale. The cases a = 0 and a = 1 appear in the Sm-
expansion of the setting sun diagram, see Exap. 3.5.4 and [55, App. B]. Verify that
supp j ⊂(V + ∪V −).
(d) For the example of part (c), we have D = 4; hence, the most simple Lorentz-
invariant choice for D is D = □. With that, compute a possible J for the particular
value a = 2, by using the ansatz
J(y) = P

log(−M 2Y )

Y
−(y →−y) ,
where P(x) is a polynomial in x.
[Solution: (a) The pointwise product j(y) θ(−y0) exists in D′(Rd \ {0}) because the
overlapping singularities of j and θ(−y0) are in (V + ∪V −) ∩{y
 y0 = 0} = {0}. The
asserted support and scaling properties of r0 and a0 can easily be veriﬁed.
(b) The pointwise product J(y) θ(−y0) exists in D′(Rd \ {0}) for the same reason as
for j(y) θ(−y0). Obviously, J(y) θ(−y0) scales also almost homogeneously with degree
D−l < d; hence, the direct extension can be applied and the so-constructed r(y) (3.5.24)
exists in D′(Rd).
In D′(Rd \ {0}) we have
r0(y) = θ(−y0) DJ(y) = D

θ(−y0)J(y)

,
since supp ∂bθ(−y0) ⊆{y
 y0 = 0} for |b| ≥1. With f 0(y) := θ(−y0)J(y), t0 := r0 and
t := r the relations (3.5.1) and (3.5.2) are satisﬁed, and from (3.5.3) and (3.5.4) we know
that r is an extension of r0 and scales almost homogeneously with degree D.
(c) For y2 < 0 we have loga(−M2Y )
Y 2
= loga(M2 |y2|)
(y2)2
which is even in y; hence, j(y) = 0.
(d) The given ansatz for J scales almost homogeneously with degree 2 = D −l (since
l = 2) and it fulﬁlls supp J ⊂(V + ∪V −) for the same reason as for j, see the solution of
part (c). r0 scales almost homogeneously with power N = a = 2; hence for the extension
r this power is ≤N + 1 = 3 (Prop. 3.2.16). Therefore, it suﬃces to consider polynomials
P which are of degree ≤3. Taking this into account when inserting the given ansatz for
J into j(y) = □J(y) (where y ̸= 0) and using
□y loga(−M 2Y )
Y
= −4a loga−1(−M 2Y )) + 4a(a −1) loga−2(−M 2Y )

As we see from the proof, this lemma holds also for distributions f ∈D′(Rk)
fulﬁlling the scaling relation (3.5.25).
78For Re D < k we know from Prop. 3.2.16 that t can be computed by the direct extension.
Nevertheless, we include the case Re D < k, because Lemma 3.5.8 holds also in this case. Note
that the extension formula (3.5.30), which we are going to derive, reduces to the direct extension
for Re D < k.

It is now clear, why the assumption D /∈k + N is needed.
The extension method (3.5.30) can be generalized to a large class of almost
homogeneously scaling distributions, provided we still have D ∈C \ (k + N) – we
explain this in Exap. 3.5.16.
The Sm-expansion and diﬀerential renormalization can be used to compute
lowest-order diagrams of QED, this is done in Sect. 5.1.7.
3.5.2
Analytic regularization
Analytic regularization was introduced by Speer [154] in the context of BPHZ renormali-
zation (i.e., in momentum space), and ﬁrst applied to x-space Epstein–Glaser renorma-
lization by Hollands [105]. Essentially, we follow [63].
The method. For massless 1-loop diagrams79 (or more generally for massless,
primitive divergent diagrams, see Exap. 3.5.14), the distribution t0 ∈D′(Rk \{0})
of Problem 3.5.1 scales homogeneously, because DF ≡ΔF
m=0 scales homoge-
neously. But even for these diagrams, there is a snag to formula (3.5.30): The de-
gree D of the homogeneous scaling is an integer, D ∈N, as explained in Sect. 3.1.5.
Hence, for D ≥k, formula (3.5.30) cannot be applied.
The basic idea of analytic regularization to solve Problem 3.5.1 is the follow-
ing: Given a distribution t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) which scales almost homogeneously
with a degree D ∈k + N and with power N ∈N, one introduces a ζ-dependent
“regularized” distribution tζ 0 ∈D′(Rk\{0}) (where ζ ∈C\{0} and |ζ| suﬃciently
79A “n-loop diagram” is a loop diagram containing n independent loops (i.e., n independent
closed lines, see Footn. 34). For example, the setting sun diagram (given in (3.2.124)) is a 2-loop
diagram, although it contains three loops: •
• , •
• and •
• ; but the union of two of
them contains the third as a subset.

small), such that limζ→0 tζ 0 = t0 (in D′(Rk \ {0})) and that tζ 0 scales almost ho-
mogeneously with a non-integer degree Dζ (which is of the form Dζ = D + D1 ζ
for some constant D1 ∈C \ {0}), and with the same power N as t0.
From Prop. 3.2.16 we know that tζ 0 has a unique extension tζ ∈D′(Rk)
which scales almost homogeneously with the same degree Dζ and the same power
N. The explicit computation of tζ is mostly much simpler than the computation
of a solution of the original extension task (Problem 3.5.1) – this is the gain of the
regularization. Namely, for N = 0, tζ can be computed by formula (3.5.30), and
for N ≥1 a further development of that formula does mostly the job, as explained
in Exap. 3.5.16.
For the resulting extension tζ one then removes the regularization, i.e., one
performs the limit ζ →0. In order that this limit exists in D′(Rk), one has to
subtract a suitable local term sζ, that is, sζ is a linear combination of derivatives
of the δ-distribution, which diverges for ζ →0. The subtraction term sζ should
be such that the limit t := limζ→0(tζ −sζ) is an almost homogeneous extension
t ∈D′(Rk) of t0.
An example for an analytic regularization is obtained by dimensional regu-
larization of the Feynman propagator; this is worked out in [63]. We give here a
related example for an analytic regularization.
Example 3.5.9. For a Lorentz covariant t0(y1, . . . , yl) ∈D′(Rdl \ {0}) a simple way to
obtain a Lorentz covariant regularization tζ 0 ∈D′(Rdl \ {0}) is
tζ 0(y1, . . . , yl) := t0(y1, . . . , yl) (M 2JYj1 . . . YjJ )ζ ,
J ≥1 ,
Yj := ±(y2
j + i s(yj) 0) ,
(3.5.31)
where s(y) ∈{1, −1, sgn y0, −sgn y0} and M > 0 is a mass scale. The latter and the
addition i s(yj) 0 are needed in order that

(3.5.32)
is well deﬁned in D′(Rdl \ {0}). If t0 is a time-ordered product, it is convenient to choose
Yj := −(y2
j −i 0), as in (3.5.11). Usually, the indices j1, . . . , jJ ∈{1, . . . , l} are chosen such
that symmetries of t0 of type t0(yπ(1), . . . , yπ(l)) = t0(y1, . . . , yl), for some permutation
π ∈Sl, hold true also for tζ 0. Due to
(y∂y + D −2Jζ)K tζ 0(y1, . . . , yl) = (M 2JYj1 . . . YjJ )ζ (y∂y + D)K t0(y1, . . . , yl) ,
where K ∈N∗and y∂y := l
r=1 yμ
r ∂yμ
r , the regularized distribution tζ 0 scales almost
homogeneously with degree
Dζ = D −2Jζ
(3.5.33)
and with the same power as t0.
In the general part of this section, we give a reﬁnement of [63, Sect. IV.A]:
We will generally deﬁne the notion of “analytic regularization” and, based on this
deﬁnition, we will give a prescription for the choice of the subtraction term sζ, for
which the limit t := limζ→0(tζ −sζ) has the required properties.

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
For this purpose we ﬁrst recall Lemma 3.2.19(a): Let t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) be
a distribution which scales almost homogeneously with degree D ∈k + N and
power N, let ω := D −k and let Dω(Rk) be deﬁned as in (3.2.23). With that,
the direct extension tω of t0 to D′
ω(Rk), deﬁned by (3.2.25), scales also almost
homogeneously with degree D and power N. In addition, tω is the only extension
to D′
ω(Rk) which maintains almost homogeneous scaling with degree D, due to
the uniqueness of tω in Claim 3.2.9.
Deﬁnition 3.5.10 ((Analytic) regularization). [63] Let t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) be a dis-
tribution which scales almost homogeneously with degree D ∈k+N and power N,
let ω, Dω(Rk) and tω be as just mentioned. A family of distributions {tζ}ζ∈Ω\{0},
tζ ∈D′(Rk), with Ω ⊆C a neighbourhood of the origin, is called a regularization
of t0, if
lim
ζ→0⟨tζ, h⟩= ⟨tω, h⟩
∀h ∈Dω(Rk) ,
(3.5.34)
and if tζ scales almost homogeneously with a degree Dζ /∈k + N (for ζ ∈Ω \ {0})
and the same power N as t0, where Dζ is of the form Dζ = D + D1 ζ for some
constant D1 ∈C \ {0}.80 The regularization {tζ} is called analytic, if for all
h ∈D(Rk) the map
Ω \ {0} ∋ζ −→⟨tζ, h⟩
(3.5.35)
is analytic with a pole of ﬁnite order at the origin.
Example 3.5.11. We continue the Exap. 3.5.9. Let tζ be the unique extension of tζ 0 (given
in (3.5.31)) to D′(Rdl) which scales almost homogeneously with degree Dζ (3.5.33) and
the same power as tζ 0 and t0. The pertinent family {tζ} is indeed a regularization of the
given t0 ∈D′(Rdl \ {0}) in the sense of Deﬁnition 3.5.10: Namely, by using the functions
χρ (3.2.22) and (3.2.26) and that limζ→0 tζ 0 = t0 in D′(Rdl \ {0}), we get
⟨tω, h⟩= lim
ρ→∞⟨t0, χρ h⟩= lim
ρ→∞lim
ζ→0⟨tζ 0, χρ h⟩

ζ→0 lim
ρ→∞⟨tζ 0, χρ h⟩= lim
ζ→0⟨tζ
ω, h⟩= lim
ζ→0⟨tζ, h⟩,
∀h ∈Dω(Rdl) ,
where tζ
ω is the direct extension of tζ 0 to D′
ω(Rdl) and we use that tζ
ω = tζ|Dω(Rdl) (which
is due to the uniqueness of tζ
ω). The crucial step is that the order of the limits may be
reversed. For the limits at hand this is an allowed operation.
In addition, in all applications of (3.5.31) we will study, the explicit formula for the
extension tζ 0 →tζ will show that this regularization is analytic.
Let t0 and tω be as in Deﬁnition 3.5.10, let {tζ} be a regularization of t0
and let t be an almost homogeneous extension of t0. From Lemma 3.2.15 we
know that there exist functions wa ∈D(Rk), a ∈Nk with |a| ≤ω, satisfying
80The formalism can be generalized to an analytic dependence of Dζ on ζ: Dζ = D+∞
s=1 Ds ζs,
Ds ∈C with D1 ̸= 0 – the latter condition is crucial. However, the regularization (3.5.31) is of
type Dζ = D + D1 ζ. So, for simplicity, we work with this special type of ζ-dependence.

In general, the limit of the individual terms on the right-hand side might not

be expanded in a Laurent series around ζ = 0, and since the overall limit is ﬁnite,
the principal parts (pp) of these Laurent series must coincide:

Proposition 3.5.12 (Minimal subtraction). Let t0 ∈D′(Rk \ {0}) be a distribution
which scales almost homogeneously with degree D ∈k + N and power N, and let

To show that tMS is an extension of t0 with sd(tMS) = sd(t0), we
compare tMS with the extension t given in (3.5.36), which has scaling degree sd(t) =
D = sd(t0), since it scales almost homogeneously with degree D. Using (3.5.37)

We proceed by induction on q. The case q = 0 is obtained by setting p = 0 in
(3.5.44). Now, we assume that (3.5.45) holds true for q ∈{0, 1, . . ., p −1}, where

i.e., the sum in (3.5.41) is restricted to |a| = D −k, as asserted. This implies
(x∂x + D) tr(x) = 0

By means of (3.5.47) we obtain the following results:
– If R ≤N the r.h.s. of (3.5.48) vanishes, since the exponent N + 1 −s is ≥1
for all s.
– If R > N the r.h.s. of (3.5.48) reduces to the term s = N + 1, which is equal
to −dN
N+1 t−(N+1) ; using again (3.5.47) we get
(x∂x + D)N+2 tMS = −dN
N+1 (x∂x + D) t−(N+1) = 0 .
□
Remark 3.5.13. Returning to (3.5.42), we see that in the last term on the r.h.s. the
sum over a runs actually only over |a| = ω, because both t and tMS scale almost
homogeneously with degree D. So we know
lim
ζ→0 rp

⟨tζ, wa⟩

= ⟨tMS, wa⟩= 0
∀|a| < ω .
Since the sum over a in (3.5.41) runs only over |a| = D −k ≡ω, we also know
that
pp

⟨tζ, wa⟩

= 0
∀|a| < ω ;
summing up we get
lim
ζ→0 ⟨tζ, wa⟩= 0
∀|a| < ω .
Hence, we may restrict the sum over a in (3.5.37) to |a| = ω. This is a peculiarity
of analytic regularization: In general, the sum over a in a W-projector yielding
an almost homogeneous extension, as in (3.5.36), includes also subtraction terms
with |a| < ω ; in particular, these terms appear in the improved Epstein–Glaser
renormalization treated in Lemma 3.2.19.
Examples. We illustrate analytic regularization and minimal subtraction by some
examples and exercises; the ﬁrst example solves the renormalization problem for
a large class of diagrams.

coming from a primitive divergent diagram Γ. That Γ
is “divergent” means that it cannot be renormalized by the direct extension, i.e., that
ω := ω(Γ) := sd(t0) −dl ≥0. “Primitive divergent” means that, in addition, there
is no subdiagram Γ1 of Γ with less vertices and with ω(Γ1) ≥0. All divergent 1-loop
diagrams are primitive divergent; the setting sun diagram in d = 4 dimensions (computed
in Exap. 3.5.4) is an example for a primitive divergent 2-loop diagram (see Footn. 79 for
the notion “n-loop diagram”).
By deﬁnition, t0 is a product of massless Feynman propagators with partial deriva-
tives; for simplicity we assume that the latter are absent:

where C ∈R is a combinatorial factor. Because Γ is primitive divergent, t0 is well deﬁned

Therefore, the l.h.s. of (3.5.53) is of the form 
a Ca∂aδ(y). The sum runs only over
|a| = ω, because the l.h.s. of (3.5.53) scales homogeneously with degree D = dl + ω.
Due to the appearance of log(M 2JYj1 . . . YjJ ) in formula (3.5.52) for tMS, there is
a breaking of homogeneous scaling. By straightforward calculation we obtain

where the coeﬃcients Ca are precisely the ones deﬁned in (3.5.53). Part (c) of Proposition
3.5.12 is indeed satisﬁed: We have 0 = N < R = 1 and the scaling-power of tMS is
1 = N + 1.
This example applies also to the leading term (i.e., the term ∼m0) of the Sm-
expansion of the T -product t(m) 0
Γ
∈D′(Rdl \ {0}) of a massive, primitive divergent
diagram Γ, because the leading term is the corresponding massless T -product t(m=0) 0
Γ
.
If, in addition, ω(Γ) = 0, the extension of t(m) 0
Γ
can be computed as follows: We write
the Sm-expansion as t(m) 0
Γ
= t(m=0) 0
Γ
+ r(m) 0, then we extend t(m=0) 0
Γ
by (3.5.52) and
the remainder r(m) 0 by the direct extension.
Remark 3.5.15. Reconsidering Prop. 3.2.16 we conclude: For any t0 ∈D′(Rdl\{0})
scaling homogeneously with degree D ∈dl + N, the universal polynomial p(∂)
(3.2.39) can be computed from t0 by means of (3.5.53).
Example 3.5.16 (Setting sun with a hat). Cf. [64, Sect. 6]. In d = 4 dimensions we compute
the massive time-ordered product t(x1 −x3, x2 −x3) belonging to the diagram
x1
x2
x3

•
which contains the setting sun diagram tss as a divergent subdiagram. We will use the
result (3.5.14) for tss ≡tm,M
ss
.
The restriction of t to D(R8 \ {0}) is given by
t0(x, y) = tss(x−y)ΔF
m(x) ΔF
m(y) ∈D′(R8 \{0}) , x := x1−x3 , y := x2 −x3 , (3.5.55)
where we omit a combinatorial prefactor and factors ℏ. To prove this claim one has to
verify that the r.h.s. of (3.5.55) satisﬁes the causal factorization (3.3.17) on D(CI) for
all I, cf. Exap. 3.3.7. This veriﬁcation uses that tss(z) = Δ+
m(z)3 for z /∈V −, as we see
from (3.5.10).
We concentrate on the renormalization, which is the extension of t0 (3.5.55) to
D′(R8). The degree D of the Sm-expansion of t0 is D = 10, hence, only the terms
O(m0) and O(m2) cannot be extended by the direct extension; so it suﬃces to choose
the remainder of order O(m4). Inserting (3.5.11) and (3.5.14) into (3.5.55) we get:

where we use the letters (v, q) (instead of (u, r)) to avoid confusion with the distributions

Techniques to renormalize in practice
211
To compute the almost homogeneous extension of the v0
...-distributions, we use an
analytic regularization of type (3.5.31) which respects the (x ↔y)-symmetry:
vζ 0(x, y) := v0(x, y) (M 4XY )ζ ,
v = v0, v2,0, v2,1 .
(3.5.56)
The regularized distributions vζ 0 scale almost homogeneously with degree Dζ = 8 −4ζ
(for vζ 0
2,0, vζ 0
2,1) or Dζ = 10 −4ζ (for vζ 0
0 ), satisfying Dζ /∈8 + N. Since the power of the
almost homogeneous scaling is 1 for u0 and u2,1, and 2 for u2,0; we see that this power
is N = 1 for vζ 0
0
and vζ 0
2,1 and N = 2 for vζ 0
2,0.
In terms of these examples we are now going to explain, how the idea underlying the
extension formula (3.5.30) (which applies only to homogeneously scaling tζ 0 ∈D′(Rk \
{0})) can be used to extend almost homogeneously scaling tζ 0. If D = k (i.e., D = 8 for
the example at hand), the method always works (see [63, Remk. 4.9]): Writing z := (x, y),
∂rzr := ∂xμxμ + ∂yμyμ and η := −4ζ, the almost homogeneous scaling of vζ 0
2,1 can be
expressed by
0 = (∂rzr + η)2vζ 0
2,1(z) = η2 vζ 0
2,1(z) + (2η −1) ∂r

zr vζ 0
2,1(z)

+ ∂r∂s

zrzs vζ 0

.
Using diﬀerential renormalization, we obtain the following result for the unique almost
homogeneous extension:
vζ
2,1 = −1


(2η −1) ∂r(zr vζ 0
2,1) + ∂r∂s(zrzs vζ 0

∈D′(R8) .
(3.5.57)
Again, the overline denotes the direct extension, which exists since sd(zr1 . . . zrl vζ 0) =
Dζ −l.
For vζ 0
2,0 we still have D = 8, but the power of the almost homogeneous scaling is
N = 2. Hence, we have
(∂rzr + η)3vζ 0
2,0(z) = 0 ,
which yields
vζ
2,0 = −1
η3

(3η2 −3η + 1) ∂r(zr vζ 0
2,0) + (3η −3) ∂r∂s(zrzs vζ 0
2,0) + ∂p∂r∂s(zpzrzs vζ 0
2,0)
	
.
(3.5.58)
If D > k(= 8) the method is more involved. For vζ 0
0
we have D −8 = 2, hence we
need at least l = 3 factors zri in order that the direct extension (zr1 . . . zrl vζ 0
0 ) exists. We
proceed as follows: From the almost homogeneous scaling of vζ 0
0
with degree Dζ = 10−4ζ
and power N = 1,
(∂rzr + 2 + η)2vζ 0
0 (z) = 0 ,
(3.5.59)
we obtain

(3 + 2η) ∂s(zs vζ 0

In addition, (zs vζ 0

power N = 1:
(∂rzr + 1 + η)2
zs vζ 0

Analogously, the degree of the almost homogeneous scaling of (zrzs vζ 0

that is,

we get

0 )
	
.
(3.5.60)
Obviously, the extensions vζ scale almost homogeneously with the same degree Dζ and
the same power as the initial vζ 0 (in accordance with Proposition 3.2.16); in addition,
the maps ζ −→⟨vζ, h⟩are meromorphic in ζ for all h ∈D(R8), with a pole at ζ = 0 of
order R = 2 (for vζ
2,1 and vζ
0) or R = 3 (for vζ
2,0). The latter shows explicitly that this
extension method does not work for the unregularized theory (i.e., for ζ = 0).
So {vζ} is an analytic regularization of v0 and Proposition 3.5.12 applies: Minimal
subtraction yields an almost homogeneous extension vMS of v0. Proceeding analogously
to Exap. 3.5.14, we expand (in ζ) (M 4XY )ζ (see (3.5.32)) and the rational functions of η
appearing in (3.5.57), (3.5.58) and (3.5.60), and select the term ∼ζ0 of the Laurent series
for vζ. In this way we obtain the following results for the general, almost homogeneous
and Lorentz invariant extensions v = vMS + 

same degree as the pertinent v0

we have R > N for all three vζ. Hence, the power of the almost homogeneous scaling of
vMS may be N + 1; but it may not be larger. However, looking at (3.5.61), we ﬁnd the
estimate:83
[scaling-power of vMS] ≤[scaling-power of v0 (= N)]
+ [maximal power of log(M 4XY )] ,
(3.5.62)
according to which there could be terms in (3.5.61) with scaling-power > N + 1; these
terms must cancel out up to terms with scaling-power ≤N + 1, by identities for the
derivatives.

Remark 3.5.17 (Sm-expansion axiom versus scaling degree axiom). According to
Corollary 3.2.23, the Sm-expansion axiom is a stronger version of the scaling degree
renormalization condition (3.2.62): If one replaces in the system of axioms given
in Sect. 3.1 [or, in case of T -products, Sect. 3.3], the Sm-expansion, axiom (k)
[or axiom (ix), resp.], by the condition (3.2.62) [or (3.3.21)], the set of allowed
retarded [or time-odered] products gets truly bigger. To illustrate this we discuss
the non-uniqueness of the inductive step n = 2 →n = 3 for Exap. 3.5.16. Taking
into account also the Lorentz invariance and (x ↔y)-symmetry, the scaling degree
condition (3.2.62) leaves the freedom to add a term of the form


(□x + □y) + f3

δ(x, y) ,
where M > 0 is a ﬁxed mass scale and f1, f2, f3 are arbitrary functions fi : R −→
C (the values are dimensionless). We have found that the stronger version of the
Sm-expansion axiom (axioms (k) and (k′)) restricts these functions to
f2

f3
 m
M


f1

,
with arbitrary constants C0, C1, C2, C3 ∈C. Such a reduction of the freedom of
(re)normalization is certainly desirable.
With the weaker version of the Sm-expansion axiom (axiom (k) without
(k′)), f2 and f3 are restricted in the same way, but f1( m
M ) may be an arbitrary
polynomial in log m
M – see (3.2.71)–(3.2.72).
83By “scaling-power” we mean the power of the almost homogeneous scaling. As we see from
the procedure in the computation of tMS, it holds that [Maximal power of log(M4XY )] = R;
hence, the estimate (3.5.62) agrees with the bound for the scaling-power of vMS derived in the
proof of part (b) of Proposition 3.5.12.

where we omit combinatorial prefactors. The restriction of t to D(R8 \ {0}) is given by

x := x1 −x3 , y := x2 −x3 ,
(3.5.64)

(a) Verify that t0 (3.5.64) fulﬁlls the causal factorization (3.3.17) on D(C{x1,x3})
(where the notation (3.3.15) is used). Combinatorial factors may be ignored.
(b) Compute the extension tMS ∈D′(R8) (minimal subtraction) of t0 (3.5.64), by
using a Lorentz invariant, analytic regularization of type (3.5.31) which respects
the (x ↔y)-symmetry.
[Solution: (a) We write “∼” for “equal up to a combinatorial prefactor”. We have to
verify that


ϕ(x1) tﬁsh(x1 −x3) ϕ2(x3) ⋆ϕ3(x2)
	
for {x1, x3} ∩(x2 + V −) = ∅. For this conﬁguration we may insert DF (x1 −x2) =
D+(x1 −x2) and tﬁsh(x2 −x3) = D+(x3 −x2)2 into the l.h.s. Computing the star
product on the r.h.s., we get the same result, namely
[r.h.s.] ∼tﬁsh(x1 −x3) D+(x1 −x2) D+(x3 −x2)2 .
(b) We use the same notations as in Exap. 3.5.16 and, in particular, the same regu-
larization as in (3.5.56). With that, tζ 0(x, y) := t0(x, y) (M 4XY )ζ
scales also almost
homogeneously with degree Dζ = 10 + η, where η := −4ζ. Searching the maximal power
of log ρ in ρDζ tζ 0(ρx, ρy), one might naively think that each factor tﬁsh contributes a
factor log ρ. But, using Exer. 3.5.5 we see that
ρDζ tζ 0(ρx, ρy)
= (M 4XY )ζ DF (x −y)

tﬁsh(x) + Cﬁsh δ(x) log ρ

tﬁsh(y) + Cﬁsh δ(y) log ρ

(where Cﬁsh :=

deﬁned only in D′(R8 \ {0}). So we have
(∂rzr + 2 + η)2 tζ 0(z) = 0
in
D′(R8 \ {0}) ,
which is the same relation as (3.5.59). Hence, the computation of tMS is precisely the
same as that of vMS
0
in Exap. 3.5.16; the result for tMS is obtained from the formula for
v0 in (3.5.61) by replacing v0
0 by t0 and by setting C2 := 0 =: C3.]

Exercise 3.5.19. Let t0 ∈D′(Rdl \ {0}) (where l ∈N∗) scale almost homogeneously with
degree D = dl + 2 and power N = 2. In addition, let tζ ∈D′(Rdl) be a regularization
of t0 of the type studied in Exaps. 3.5.9 and 3.5.11; that is, tζ is the unique almost
homogeneous extension of a distribution tζ 0 ∈D′(Rdl \{0}), where the latter is obtained
from t0 by a relation of the form (3.5.31). Compute the minimally subtracted extension
tMS ∈D′(Rdl) of t0 resulting from this regularization.
[Solution: We proceed analogously to the computation of the (m = 0)-part vMS
0
of
Exap. 3.5.16 and use the same notations; the only essential diﬀerence is that the power
of the almost homogeneous scaling of tζ 0 is N = 2 instead of N = 1. So we have
(∂rzr + 2 + η)3 tζ 0(z) = 0 ,
which gives

.
Analogously, the scaling relations
(∂rzr + 1 + η)3(zs tζ 0(z)) = 0

(∂pzp + η)3(zrzs tζ 0(z)) = 0
yield

Overlapping divergences. We ﬁnish Sect. 3.5 by pointing out that the renormali-
zation of diagrams with overlapping divergences is signiﬁcantly less troublesome
in the inductive Epstein–Glaser construction than in traditional renormalization
schemes.
Remark 3.5.20. Overlapping divergences caused a lot of problems in the develop-
ment of renormalization theory.84 In this remark we explain their role in Epstein–
Glaser renormalization. For simplicity we work with T -products (instead of R-
products).
Roughly speaking, a Feynman diagram Γ has overlapping divergences, if and
only if it contains two divergent subdiagrams85 Γ1(⊆Γ) and Γ2(⊆Γ) such that
Γ1 ̸⊆Γ2 ∧Γ2 ̸⊆Γ1 ∧
Γ1 and Γ2 share at least one inner line.
(3.5.66)
Note that the ﬁrst two conditions imply that Γ1 ̸= Γ and Γ2 ̸= Γ. We give some
examples:
(a) The setting sun diagram (see (3.2.124)) in d = 4 dimensions has overlapping
divergences; the overlapping divergent subdiagrams Γ1 and Γ2 are both ﬁsh
diagrams.
(b) The “setting sun with a hat” in d = 4 dimensions (computed in Exap. 3.5.16)
has several overlapping divergences. To fulﬁll the criterion (3.5.66) one may
choose for Γ1 and Γ2 two ﬁsh diagrams which are both subdiagrams of the
setting sun subdiagram. Alternatively, one may choose
Γ1 := x1
x2
•
•
and
Γ2 :=
x1
x2
x3
•
•
•
(c) The diagram (3.5.63) in d = 4 dimensions, which contains two ﬁsh diagrams
as divergent subdiagrams, does not have any overlapping divergences, because
these ﬁsh diagrams do not share an inner line.
84For a short overview of the history of overlapping divergences see [174, Sect. 18.2].
85The notions “subdiagram” and “divergent diagram” are deﬁned in Remark 3.3.4 and
Exap. 3.5.14, respectively.

(d) A prototype of a diagram with overlapping divergences is

in d = 6 dimensions.
(3.5.67)
Note that the two triangle subdiagrams, Γ1 with vertices {x1, x2, x3} and Γ2
with vertices {x2, x3, x4}, have both singular order ω = 0.
From these examples we see that, in the framework of the inductive Epstein–Glaser
construction, the renormalization of a lot of diagrams with overlapping divergences
is not signiﬁcantly more diﬃcult than for other diagrams. For example, this holds
for (b) compared with (c) (both have n = 3 vertices and ω = 2), or for (a)
compared with the ﬁsh diagram in d = 6 dimensions (both have n = 2 vertices
and ω = 2, that the number of loops is diﬀerent is unimportant for the Epstein–
Glaser construction).
In the remainder of this remark we study the case in which the divergent
and overlapping subdiagrams Γ1 and Γ2 have both less vertices than the over-
all diagram Γ for all possible choices of Γ1 and Γ2. From the above examples
only (d) satisﬁes this condition. In this case, a simplifying feature of the Epstein–
Glaser construction is that the subdiagrams Γ1 and Γ2 are renormalized in pre-
ceding inductive steps. However, frequently the following diﬃculty appears, which
is typical for overlapping divergences of this kind: To write down the distribution
t0 ∈D′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}) which gives the T -product of the overall diagram Γ outside
the thin diagonal x1 = · · · = xn (where x1, . . . , xn denotes the vertices of Γ) one
needs a partition of unity, see (3.3.18).
We illustrate this for the example (d) (cf. [63, Exap. 4.16]): For simplicity
we assume that the mass m is m = 0. The overall diagram (3.5.67) has ω = 2; we
use the notations xkl := xk −xl and x := (x12, x13, x14) ∈R18. Let t△(x12, x13) ∈
D′(R12) be the renormalized T -product belonging to the subdiagram Γ1 (i.e.,
t△(x12, x13) is an extension of DF (x12) DF (x23) DF (x13) ∈D′(R12 \ {0})). With
that, the corresponding distribution for Γ2 is t△(x42, x43). To write down t0 ∈
D′(R18 \ {0}) (belonging to the overall diagram), we consider the expressions
t1(x) := t△(x12, x13) DF (x24) DF (x34) ,
t2(x) := t△(x42, x43) DF (x12) DF (x13) .
Restricted86 to D(ˇR18), these distributions t1(x) and t2(x) both agree with
tunren(x) := DF (x12) DF (x13) DF (x23) DF (x24) DF (x34) ,
86See (3.5.50) for the deﬁnition of ˇR18.

218
Chapter 3.

that is, both are terms expressing the diagram Γ. They are well deﬁned even in
the following spaces:
t1 ∈D′
R18 \ {x


 x24 = 0 = x34}

,
t2 ∈D′
R18 \ {x


 x12 = 0 = x13}

.
But neither t1 nor t2 exists in D′(R18 \ {0}). Hence, we need a partition of unity:
For x ∈R18 \ {0} let
1 = f1(x) + f2(x)
with
f1, f2 ∈C∞(R18 \ {0})
(3.5.68)
and
supp f1 ⊆R18 \ {x


 x24 = 0 = x34} ,
supp f2 ⊆R18 \ {x


 x12 = 0 = x13} .
(3.5.69)
Since
t1(x) = tunren(x) = t2(x)
on
D(R18 \ {x


 x24 = 0 = x34 ∨x12 = 0 = x13})
(3.5.70)
we may construct t0 as follows:87
t0(x) = f1(x) t1(x) + f2(x) t2(x) ∈D′(R18 \ {0}) .
(3.5.71)
Due to (3.5.70), the so-constructed t0 does not depend on the choice of (f1, f2).
Therefore, applying analytic regularization and minimal subtraction to this for-
mula for t0, the resulting tMS is also independent of the choice of (f1, f2).
However, to compute tMS we need to know (f1, f2) explicitly. An admissible
choice for this pair of functions can be obtained as follows: Let χ be a smooth ap-
proximation of the Heaviside-function θ(x) with supp dχ
dx ⊆[−ε, ε] for a suﬃciently
small ε > 0.88 For x ∈R6 we mean by |x| the Euclidean norm. We set
g2(x) :=

χ

|x12|2+|x13|2
|x14|2
−a

if
x14 ̸= 0
1
if
x14 = 0 ∧x ̸= 0
,
(3.5.72)
with a suﬃciently small a > 0. Note that g2 ∈C∞(R18 \ {0}). Let
g1(x) ≡g1(x12, x13, x14) := g2(x24, x34, x14) .
(3.5.73)
87This is an optimized version of the construction (3.3.18) – optimized in the sense that the
partition of unity has a minimal number of elements.
88The standard construction of such a function χ(x) goes as follows: First recall that
k : R −→R ; k(x) :=

0
for
x ≤−ε
e−1/(x+ε)
for
x > −ε
is smooth. Then
χ(x) :=
k(x)
k(x) + k(−x)
is smooth, equal to 1 for x ≥ε and equal to 0 for x ≤−ε.

219
The sets
Kj := {x ̸= 0


 gj(x) = 0} ,
j = 1, 2 ,
(3.5.74)
are narrow cones around the diagonal x12 = x13 = x14 (for g1) and the x14-axis
(for g2). Since K1 ∩K2 = ∅, we have g1(x) + g2(x) > 0 for all x ̸= 0 and, hence,
we may set
fj(x) :=
gj(x)
g1(x) + g2(x) ,
j = 1, 2 .
(3.5.75)
Obviously the pair (f1, f2) satisﬁes the required properties (3.5.68) and (3.5.69),
and is also (1 ↔4)-symmetric and scales homogeneously with degree 0:
f1(x) = f2(−x24, −x34, −x14) ,
fj(ρx) = fj(x)
∀ρ ̸= 0 .
(3.5.76)
It seems that the construction given in this example can be generalized to a sys-
tematic construction of a partition of unity for all diagrams which need this tool
when we construct t0 ∈D′(Rk \{0}) by Stora’s extension method (i.e., the method
brieﬂy explained in Sect. 3.3). However, this is not yet worked out.
We recall that the use of a partition of unity can be avoided by working
with the distribution splitting method of Epstein and Glaser [66, 148] (see also
Exer. 3.5.7); but for diagrams without overlapping divergences of the just treated
kind, Stora’s extension method is mostly much more eﬃcient for an inductive
construction of the T -product.
3.6
The St¨uckelberg–Petermann renormalization group
References for this section are [27, 55, 57] which use ideas developed in [102].
It is one of the main insights of renormalization theory that the ambiguities
of the renormalization process can equivalently be described by redeﬁnitions of
the parameters of the given model, and that these redeﬁnitions form a group –
the “renormalization group” (RG). This was ﬁrst observed by E.C.G. St¨uckelberg
and A. Petermann in 1953 [163].
In our framework of causal perturbation theory the corresponding statement
is the “Main Theorem of perturbative renormalization”. The main diﬀerence to
traditional formulations of the renormalization group in pQFT is that in causal
perturbation theory the parameters of a model are spacetime-dependent coupling
constants κ g(x), that is, they are test functions. Therefore, the renormalization
group which governs the change of parameters is more complicated, and it is only in
the adiabatic limit g(x) →1 that the more standard version of the renormalization
group will be recovered. Fortunately, an algebraic version of this limit, which
circumvents the problem of infrared divergences [24], is suﬃcient for this purpose
[27, 55, 102], as explained in Sects. 3.7–3.8. In this way, one ﬁnds an intrinsically
local construction of the renormalization group which is suited for theories on
curved spacetime and for theories with a bad infrared behavior.

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
3.6.1
Deﬁnition of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann RG
In terms of the S-matrix S(F) (Def. 3.3.8) the Main Theorem is essentially the
following statement: A change S →ˆS of the renormalization prescription can
equivalently be described by a renormalization of the interaction F →Z(F):
ˆS(F) = S

Z(F)

∀F ∈Floc .
(3.6.1)
The deﬁnition of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann RG is such that the set of all maps
Z : Floc −→Floc appearing in this relation, when (S, ˆS) runs through all admissible
pairs of S-matrices, is precisely the St¨uckelberg–Petermann RG.
Consequently, the deﬁnition of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann RG depends on
the set of renormalization conditions for the T -product [or R-product] – see the
comment (a) below and Remk. 3.6.6. The following Deﬁnition works with the
renormalization conditions (v)–(x) [or (f)–(l)] given in Sect. 3.3 [or Sect. 3.1, re-
spectively] without the addition (k′) to the Sm-expansion axiom (introduced in
Sect. 3.2.6).
Deﬁnition 3.6.1. The St¨uckelberg–Petermann renormalization group to the star
product ⋆m ≡⋆Δ+
m is the set R of all maps Z ≡Z(m) : Floc[[ℏ, κ]] −→Floc[[ℏ, κ]]
satisfying the following properties:89
(1) Analyticity: Z is analytic in the sense that
Z(F) =
∞

n=0
1
n! Z(n)(F ⊗n) ,
where
Z(n) := Z(n)(0) : F⊗n
loc −→Floc
is the nth derivative of Z(F) at F = 0 (i.e., Z(n) is linear, symmetrical in all
factors and can be computed by Z(n)(F ⊗n) =
dn
dλn


λ=0Z(λF); see (A.1.19)–
(A.1.22)).
(2) Lowest orders: Z(0) ≡Z(0) = 0, Z(1) = Id .
(3) Locality, Translation covariance and Sm-expansion: For all monomials A1, . . .

and M > 0 is a ﬁxed mass scale. In addition, for l = 0 it holds that Pl = 0.

more explicitly

(6) ∗-structure and Field parity: Z(F)∗= Z(F ∗) and α Z(F) = Z(αF) , ∀F ∈
Floc .
(7) Field equation: Z(n)
ϕ(g) ⊗F ⊗(n−1)
= 0
∀n ≥2 , g ∈D(M) , F ∈Floc.
(8) ℏ-dependence: for all monomials A1, . . . , An it holds that
z(n)(A1, . . . , An) ∼ℏ1−n+n
j=1 |Aj|/2
if
A1, . . . , An ∼ℏ0 ,
(3.6.6)
where we use the convention given in Footn. 33.
As already done in (3.6.2), we will work also with the Floc-valued distributions
Z(n)
A1(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗An(xn)) ∈D′(Mn, Floc) , A1, . . . , An ∈P; they are deﬁned
analogously to (3.1.3)–(3.1.4) and they satisfy the AWI,
∂xlZ(n)
· · · ⊗A(xl) ⊗· · · ) = Z(n)
· · · ⊗(∂A)(xl) ⊗· · · ) ,
A ∈P ,
(3.6.7)
because Z(n) depends on (local) functionals only.
We make some comments:
(a) To each renormalization condition for the T -product (or R-product) there is
a corresponding deﬁning condition for R. In the deﬁnition of R given here,
Translation covariance and Sm-expansion are combined with the basic re-
quirement “Locality”; cf. Remk. 3.6.6.
(b) Assuming that Field independence (and, hence, the Wick expansion (3.6.9)
below) hold true, the Field parity property is equivalent to:
z(n)(A1, . . . , An) = 0
if
n

j=1
|Aj|
is odd, ∀monomials A1, . . . , An.
(3.6.8)
This can be seen by proceeding analogously to the derivation of (3.1.34).

222
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
(c) Note that
z(n)(A1, . . . , An) = 0
if some Aj is a C-number;
this follows from property (3): If, e.g., A1 is a C-number, then the VEV
(3.6.2) does not depend on x1, this contradicts (3.6.3).
Considering the VEV of the Field equation property we get
z(n)(A1, . . . , An) = 0
if
Ak = ∂aϕ
for some
k ∈{1, . . ., n} , a ∈Nd .
(d) Similarly to the axiom Field independence for the R- or T -product, the Field
independence property (4) is equivalent to the validity of the (causal) Wick
expansion (3.1.24) for Z(n), ∀n ≥2; that is, for all monomials A1, . . . , An ∈
P it holds that
Z(n)
A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)

(3.6.9)
=

Al⊆Al
z(n)(A1, . . . , An

(x1 −xn, . . .) A1(x1) · · · An(xn) .
Hence, by linearity, Z(n) is completely determined by the vacuum expectation
values (3.6.2). In particular, the condition that z(n)(. . .) depends only on
the relative coordinates (part of property (3)) is equivalent to Translation
covariance in the form: βa ◦Z = Z ◦βa for all a ∈Rd.
We point out that the sum in (3.6.9) is restricted by the conditions
ω(A1, . . . , An) ≥0
∧
|Al| ≥2 ∀1 ≤l ≤n
∧
n

l=1
|Al| is even. (3.6.10)
The ﬁrst restriction follows from (3.6.3)–(3.6.4), the second and the last one
are reformulations of the comments (c) and (b), respectively.
Inserting (3.6.3) into (3.6.9) and taking into account linearity of Z(n),
we conclude that
Z(n)
A1(x1), . . . , An(xn)



D(Mn\Δn) = 0
∀A1, . . . , An ∈P ,
(3.6.11)
that is supp Z(n)
A1(x1), . . .

⊆Δn for the support in the sense of distribu-
tions; see (A.1.12) for the notation.
(e) A further consequence of the Field independence (3.6.5) is that supp Z(F) ≡
suppx
δZ(F )
δϕ(x) is a subset of supp F (cf. (3.1.21)); taking into account also
Z(F) = F + [higher orders in F], we see that
supp Z(F) = supp F
∀F ∈Floc .
(3.6.12)

(f) In the ℏ-dependence property, the exponent of ℏon the r.h.s. of (3.6.6) is an
element of N∗; because z(n)(A1, . . . , An) = 0 if n
j=1 |Aj| ̸∈2(n + N), as we
know from the comments (b) and (c). This implies z(n)(A1, . . . , An) = O(ℏ)
for all monomials A1, . . . , An which are ∼ℏ0. The latter result can be written
as
Z(n) = O(ℏ)
∀n ≥2 ,
∀Z ∈R ,
(3.6.13)
by taking into account the causal Wick expansion (3.6.9).
(g) For a massless model the condition (3.6.3) simpliﬁes to
z(n)(A1, . . . , An)(x1 −xn, . . .)
= Sn

|a|=ω
Ca(A1, . . . , An) ∂aδ(x1 −xn, . . . , xn−1 −xn) ;
hence, z(n)(A1, . . . , An) scales homogeneously with degree D = n
j=1 dim Aj
for all monomials A1, . . . , An. Taking into account (3.6.9) and linearity of
Z(n), the latter is equivalent to
σρ ◦Z ◦σ−1
ρ
= Z
for
m = 0 ;
(3.6.14)
this is analogous to the equivalence of (3.1.56) and (3.1.57), in particular see
(3.1.58)–(3.1.59).
But, proceeding analogously for m > 0, we conclude from (3.6.3) that
Z(n)
(m) scales only almost homogeneously under (X, m) →(ρX, m/ρ) (where
X := (x1, . . . , xn)):
σρ ◦Z(n)
(m/ρ)

σ−1
ρ (F)⊗n
is a polynomial in log ρ , ∀F ∈Floc , n ∈N∗,
(3.6.15)
cf. (3.1.67).
The further comments investigate the structure of the set R.
(h) That (R, ◦) (where ◦denotes the composition of maps) is a group, is proved
below in Corollary 3.6.4.
(i) For k ≥2 let ˜Z(k) be a linear and symmetrical map ˜Z(k) : F⊗k

let

˜Z(k) ◦τk

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
From Deﬁnition 3.6.1 we conclude that
˜Z ∈R ⇐⇒
˜Zn ∈R
∀n ∈N∗.
(3.6.18)
(j) A related consequence of Deﬁnition 3.6.1 is that R has the structure of an
aﬃne space [63]; more precisely we mean the following: Taking into account
the deﬁning property (2) and (3.6.13), we write R as
Id +ℏV[[ℏ]] := R .
(3.6.19)
Then, the statement is that the set V[[ℏ]] is a vector space. This can be veriﬁed
straightforwardly.
By means of the result (3.6.19), the statement (3.6.18) can equivalently
be reformulated as follows:
˜Z ∈R ⇐⇒
˜Z(k) ◦τk ∈ℏV[[ℏ]]
∀k ≥2 .

Aj ∈P, gj ∈D(M) and there is no sum over j. Taking into account (3.6.10), we may
also assume that Aj ̸= ω0(Aj); this implies supp Fj = supp gj, as we see from (1.3.11).

The Main Theorem of perturbative renormalization
In the framework of causal perturbation theory, a ﬁrst version of this theorem
(including the name) was given by G. Popineau and R. Stora [138], later versions
can be found in [88, 102, 136]; we present here the more elaborated version of [55],
translated from R-product into T -product – this translation simpliﬁes the central
formula (3.6.20), see Exer. 3.6.11.
Theorem 3.6.3 (Main Theorem).
(a) Given two renormalization prescriptions, i.e., two time-ordered products T =
(Tn) and T = ( Tn) both fulﬁlling the axioms, there exists an analytic map
Z : Floc −→Floc (i.e., Z satisﬁes the property (1) of Deﬁnition 3.6.1), which
is uniquely determined by
T(eiF/ℏ

) = T

or equivalently
S = S ◦Z .

This Z is an element of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann renormalization group R.
(b) Conversely, given an S-matrix S fulﬁlling the axioms for the time-ordered
product and an arbitrary Z ∈R, the composition S := S ◦Z also satisﬁes
these axioms.
Corollary 3.6.4 (Group properties). If Z1, Z2 ∈R, then Z1 ◦Z2 ∈R. In addition,
for any Z ∈R, the inverse Z−1 is also an element of R. Due to these properties,
(R, ◦) is indeed a group.
Proof of the corollary. Let Z1, Z2 ∈R, and choose an arbitrary S-matrix S. The-
orem 3.6.3(b) shows that S1 := S◦Z1 and S2 := S1 ◦Z2 also satisfy the axioms for
time-ordered products. Clearly S2 = S◦(Z1◦Z2), so it follows from the uniqueness
statement of Theorem 3.6.3(a) that Z1 ◦Z2 ∈R.
The inverse of Z1 can be obtained as follows: To the pair (S1, S) there exists
a unique Z3 fulﬁlling S := S1 ◦Z3; with that we have S = S ◦(Z1 ◦Z3) and

S1 = S1 ◦(Z3 ◦Z1). Applying the uniqueness statement of Theorem 3.6.3(a) to
the pairs (S, S) and (S1, S1), we get Z1 ◦Z3 = Id and Z3 ◦Z1 = Id, respectively.
In addition, Theorem 3.6.3(a) says also that Z3 ∈R.

For n = 1, we get iF/ℏ= T1(iF/ℏ) = T1(iZ(1)(F)/ℏ) = iZ(1)(F)/ℏ, so that

erties of S and Z.90 This is an easy task for the Initial condition (axiom (ii)), the
Poincar´e covariance (axiom (vii)),

(3.6.24)
and the Field parity (axiom (vi)).
90We are not aware of any place in the literature, where this veriﬁcation is presented. To get a
better understanding of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann RG and the Main Theorem, we proceed in
detail.

To verify Causality (axiom (iv)) we work with the formulation (3.3.28) of
this axiom: Let supp H ∩(supp F + V −) = ∅. From Exer. 3.6.2(a) we then know
that Z(H + F) = Z(H) + Z(F). By using also supp Z(F) = supp F (3.6.12) and
Causality of S, we obtain

The veriﬁcation of Linearity (axiom (i)), Symmetry (axiom (iii)) and Field

argumentations generalize straightforwardly to Tn , n ∈(2 + N), by using

disjoint subsets. The two terms |P| = n and |P| = 1, respectively, are explicitly
written out. This formula is the generalization of (3.6.21)–(3.6.22) to arbitrary
orders n. Formula (3.6.25) is obtained from (3.6.23) by computing the nth deriva-
tive on the r.h.s. by means of the chain rule. In the literature, the chain rule for
higher derivatives is sometimes called “Fa`a di Bruno formula” [68].
To simplify the notations we verify the other axioms only for T3. The Field
equation (axiom (viii)) is obtained as follows:

by using the Field equation property (7) of Z(2) and Z(3); with regard to the
expression ϕ(g) ⋆ΔF · · · see the comment to (3.3.20).
ℏ-dependence (axiom (x)): We know that the ﬁrst and the last term on the
r.h.s. of (3.6.22) satisfy this condition. Let us study the VEV of, e.g., the second
term without the factor i2; using (3.6.9) it can be written as

as claimed.
Sm-expansion (axiom (ix)): Again, investigating the r.h.s. of (3.6.22), the
assertion is non-obvious only for the terms containing Z(2). We give the proof

go over to f1 u(m)

The Fa`a di Bruno formula for S(n)(0) = (S ◦Z)(n)(0), given in
(3.6.25), is now interpreted diﬀerently: (Tj)j∈N∗and ( Tj)j∈N∗are given and we
are searching a Z, i.e., a sequence (Z(j))j∈N∗, solving this equation for all n ∈N∗.

However, in higher orders the use of a partition of unity cannot be avoided, see, e.g., (3.5.71).
To indicate the general procedure we work here with a partition of unity.

The solution (Z(j))j∈N∗can be constructed by solving (3.6.25) inductively; in
addition, this construction shows that the solution is unique.
It remains to prove that the so-obtained Z (3.6.16) is an element of R. Ob-
viously, Z(n) is a linear and symmetric map Z(n): F⊗n
loc −→F , that the range
actually fulﬁlls Z(n)(F⊗n
loc ) ⊆Floc will turn out below. We have already derived
the properties Z(0) = 0 and Z(1) = Id. To verify that Z fulﬁlls the further deﬁning
conditions of an element of R, we show inductively that the pertinent truncation
Zn (3.6.17) fulﬁlls Zn ∈R ∀n ∈{2, 3, . . .}. So we assume that Zk ∈R ∀k < n.
Formula (3.6.25) can be written as
 i
ℏ
1−n
Z(n) = Tn −T(n−1),n
where
T(n−1)(eiF/ℏ
⊗
) := (S◦Zn−1)(F) . (3.6.28)
For example, (i/ℏ)3 T(2),3(x1 ⊗x2 ⊗x3) is the sum of the ﬁrst four terms on
the r.h.s. of (3.6.22). From part (b) of the theorem we know that T(n−1) ≡
(T(n−1),k)k∈N∗also satisﬁes the axioms for time-ordered products. In addition,
applying (3.6.25) to T(n−1),k = (S◦Zn−1)(k) for k ≤n−1, and using Z(j)
n−1 = Z(j)
for j ≤n −1, we conclude that
Tk = T(n−1),k
∀1 ≤k ≤n −1 .
(3.6.29)
Summing up, Z(n) is the diﬀerence, to nth order, of two T -products ( ˆT and T(n−1)),
which agree to lower orders, that is, Z(n) has the form of an indeterminate term
in the inductive step (n −1) →n of the Epstein–Glaser construction. We con-
clude: For monomials A1, . . . , An the vacuum expectation value z(n)(A1, . . . , An)
(3.6.2) is of the form (3.2.71)–(3.2.72), that is, Z(n) fulﬁlls the condition “Local-
ity, Translation covariance and Sm-expansion” (3.6.3)–(3.6.4). In addition, Z(n)
satisﬁes the conditions “Field independence” (which implies the causal Wick ex-
pansion (3.6.9)), “Lorentz covariance”, “Field parity”, “Field equation” and “ℏ-
dependence”, because Tn and T(n−1),n fulﬁll the corresponding conditions. In par-
ticular, the relations (3.6.3) and (3.6.9) imply Z(n)(F⊗n
loc ) ⊆Floc.
To verify the “∗-structure” condition, it is simpler to proceed non-inductively:
By reversing the calculation (3.6.24) we get S

Z(F ∗)
⋆−1 = S

Z(F)∗⋆−1, which
implies Z(F ∗) = Z(F)∗∀F ∈Floc.
All these properties of Z(n) can be summarized by Z(n) ∈ℏV[[ℏ]]; this implies
Zn ∈R. With that, the proof is complete.
□
Remark 3.6.5. If the values of the products Tn were on-shell ﬁelds,92 that is,
Ran Tn ⊆F/J (where J is the ideal of the free ﬁeld equation (2.6.2)), then the
inductive construction of (Z(n))n∈N∗becomes much more complicated: Formula
(3.6.25) would only determine
T1

Z(n)(⊗n
j=1Fj)

= Z(n)(⊗n
j=1Fj) + J .
92In contrast to the on-shell T-product T on (introduced in Sect. 3.4), we assume in this remark
that the arguments of the T-product are still local oﬀ-shell ﬁelds.

Remark 3.6.6 (Larger version of St¨uckelberg–Petermann group). If one omits some
renormalization conditions from the list of axioms for T -products, the Main The-
orem still holds true for a larger version R0 of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann group,
which is obtained by omitting the pertinent conditions in Deﬁnition 3.6.1. A min-
imal set of axioms, needed to prove the Main Theorem in the above-described
way, is given by the basic axioms plus Translation covariance and Field indepen-
dence. The pertinent deﬁning properties for R0 are (1), (2), (4) and a substitute
for (3) expressing only Locality and Translation covariance: for all monomials
A1, . . . , An ∈P the VEV (3.6.2) depends only on the relative coordinates and is
of the form
z(n)
(m)(A1, . . . , An)(x1 −xn, . . .)

= Sn

with m-dependent coeﬃcients Ca
(m)(A1, . . . , An) (not depending on (x1−xn, . . . )).
If one works with time-ordered products fulﬁlling the axiom Scaling de-
gree (3.2.62) (instead of the axiom Sm-expansion), the deﬁnition of the pertinent
St¨uckelberg–Petermann group is modiﬁed as follows: Property (3) is replaced by
the just given formulation of Locality and Translation covariance and by the prop-
erty
sd z(n)
(m)(A1, . . . , An)(x1 −xn, . . . ) ≤
n

j=1
dim Aj ,
∀monomials A1, . . . , An ∈P .
(3.6.31)
The latter condition can equivalently be expressed by the restriction
|a| ≤
n

j=1
dim(Aj) −d(n −1)
(3.6.32)
of the sum over a in (3.6.30).
Remark 3.6.7 (Alternative formulation of Locality). The formulation of Locality
and Translation covariance given in (3.6.3) or (3.6.30), respectively, assumes the
validity of the property Field independence, i.e., that Z(n)(A1, . . . , An) is com-
pletely determined by the vacuum expectation values z(n)(A1, . . . , An), Al ⊆Al,
see (3.6.9). Alternatively, Locality can be formulated directly in terms of the maps
F −→Z(F), namely by the condition
Z(F +G+H) = Z(F +G)−Z(G)+Z(G+H)
if
supp F ∩supp H = ∅, (3.6.33)
which we proved for Z ∈R (Def. 3.6.1) in Exer. 3.6.2; for details see [27, Sect. 4].
This formulation of Locality does not include Translation covariance and it does
not need the validity of the Field independence property. Note the formal similarity

3.6.

of the Locality condition (3.6.33) to the Additivity condition (1.3.21); however,
these are conditions on maps of diﬀerent kind: The domains and the ranges are
diﬀerent.
Exercise 3.6.8 (Equivalent reformulation of the properties “Locality and Translation co-
variance” and “Scaling degree” of Z ∈R0). Let R0 be the version of the St¨uckelberg–
Petermann RG (Deﬁnition 3.6.1) deﬁned by the properties (1), (2), (4) and the substitute
(3.6.30) for (3), and let Z ∈R0.

Applying ω0( · ) to this equation, we immediately obtain (3.6.30); hence, (3.6.34) is
equivalent to (3.6.30) (under the assumption that Z satisﬁes (1), (2) and (4)).
(b) Prove that, for Z ∈R0, the validity of the Scaling degree property (3.6.31) is

where ca,c is a combinatorial factor containing possibly a sign. Inserting the latter formula
into the preceding one, we obtain the assertion for arbitrary monomials A1, . . . , An, with

for all polynomials A1, . . . , An, since Z(n) is linear.

Example 3.6.9 (UV-ﬁnite interactions). An interaction L ∈P in d dimensions – for sim-
plicity we assume that L is a monomial – is called
“UV-ﬁnite” iﬀ
n dim L < (n −1)d
∀n ≥2 .
The reason for this name is that for an UV-ﬁnite L the axiom Scaling degree (3.2.62)
implies that
sd t(L1, . . . , Ln) ≤n dim L < (n −1)d
∀submonomials Lj ⊆L
and, hence, the inductive construction of S

L(g)

, g ∈D(M), uses solely the direct
extension. Consequently, S

L(g)

is unique.
For any Z ∈R, the properties “Locality and Translation covariance” (3.6.30),
“Scaling degree” (3.6.32) and “Field independence” (3.6.9) imply that
Z(n)
L(g)

= 0 ∀n ≥2 ,
that is,
Z

L(g)

= L(g)
for all UV-ﬁnite interactions L.

Examples for UV-ﬁnite interactions are L = ϕn , n ∈N∗in d = 2 dimensions and
L = ϕ2 for d = 3.
Due to the Main Theorem, the statement that an interaction κL ∈Pbal is
super-renormalizable by power counting (see Proposition 3.2.28), is equivalent to
ﬁniteness of the (formal) sum Z(κL(g)) = ∞

Due to (3.6.39), we interpret F −→Z(F) as the renormalization of the
interaction and G −→Z′(F)G as the ﬁeld renormalization.
From the Field equation property of an arbitrary renormalization map Z ∈R
we see that
Z′(F)(∂aϕ)(g) = (∂aϕ)(g)
∀g ∈D(M) , a ∈Nd ,
that is, the ﬁeld renormalization of a (derivated) basic ﬁeld is the identity.
By means of Proposition 3.3.14 we conclude: An equivalent version of the
Main Theorem (Thm. 3.6.3) is obtained by replacing in both parts, (a) and (b),
the formula S := S ◦Z by (3.6.39).
3.6.3
The Gell-Mann–Low cocycle
M. Gell-Mann and F.E. Low [82] applied the general concept of renormalization
group (found by St¨uckelberg and Petermann [163]) to scaling transformations.
The crucial observation is that the eﬀect of a scaling transformation is precisely
a change of the renormalization prescription. Therefore, by means of the Main
Theorem (Thm. 3.6.3), a scaling transformation can equivalently be described by
a renormalization of the interaction. In the (algebraic) adiabatic limit, the latter
amounts to a change of the physical parameters (Sect. 3.8.1). Proceeding this way,
the mass and the coupling constant become scale dependent (Sect. 3.8.2). This
“running” of the physical parameters can be understood physically: For example an
electron is, according to the laws of QED, always surrounded by a cloud of electron-
positron pairs, which are constantly created from the vacuum and immediately
annihilated. Since the positrons are attracted and the electrons are repelled by the
initial (stable) electron, the charge of the latter is screened. Hence, the observed
value of this charge depends on the distance of the observer.
We now start to work this out in our framework, by following essentially
[27]; see also [55, 88, 102]. The basic result is that, starting with an S-matrix Sm

satisfying the axioms for time-ordered products, the scaled S-matrix93
Sm
ρ := σρ ◦Sm/ρ ◦σ−1
ρ
(3.6.43)
fulﬁlls also these axioms (with respect to ⋆m), that is, it diﬀers from Sm only
by a change of the renormalization prescription. This can be veriﬁed straight-
forwardly. Heuristically, this can be understood as follows: The “unrenormalized”
time-ordered product, i.e., the restriction of T (m)
n

A1(x1)⊗· · ·⊗An(xn)

to D( ˇMn),
is a multiple ⋆ΔF
m-product (see part (b) of Lemma 3.3.2), and the latter is scaling
invariant:

on D( ˇMn),
due to ρd−2 ΔF
m/ρ(ρy) = ΔF
m(y), as one veriﬁes similarly to (3.1.51) (Exer. 3.1.21).
Note also that for an arbitrary R-product the diﬀerence between
Rm
ρ (eS
⊗, F) := σρ ◦Rm/ρ(e
σ−1
ρ
S
⊗
, σ−1
ρ F)
and
Rm(eS
⊗, F)
vanishes for ℏ→0
for all S, F ∈Floc, because of (3.1.55).
Due to the above result, we may apply the Main Theorem: There exists a
unique Zm
ρ ∈R such that
Sm
ρ = Sm ◦Zm
ρ .
(3.6.44)
So (Zm
ρ −Id) describes the breaking of homogeneous scaling under (X, m) →
(ρX, ρ−1m).
We thus obtain a one-parameter family { Zm
ρ


 ρ > 0 } ⊂R; but these do not
form a subgroup: The group law is obstructed by a cocycle, the “Gell-Mann–Low
cocycle”. Concretely, from

Zm
ρ1ρ2 = Zm

(3.6.45)
which is a cocycle relation. By means of (3.6.14), this simpliﬁes to
Zρ1ρ2 = Zρ1 ◦Zρ2
for
m = 0 ,
(3.6.46)
that is, in the massless case we have a one-parameter group.
93Since the mass-dependence of the time-ordered products and of the elements Z of R plays an
important role in the following, we write m as an upper index: Sm ≡S and Zm ≡Z.

236
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
We are now going to show that Zm (n)
ρ
is a polynomial in log ρ for all n ≥2.
This follows from the Sm-expansion axiom in the following way: Due to this axiom,
the relation (3.1.67) holds – also for T -products, that is,
σρ ◦Sm/ρ (n)(0) ◦(σ−1
ρ )⊗n = (Sm ◦Zm
ρ )(n)(0)
(3.6.47)
is a polynomial in log ρ . Inserting the Fa`a di Bruno formula (3.6.25) into the
r.h.s. and proceeding by induction on n, we get the assertion.

ﬁsh(y) = Cﬁsh δ(y) log ρ ,
Cﬁsh = −i

(3.6.49)
The r.h.s. of (3.6.49) does not depend on the renormalization mass scale M;
that is, the breaking of homogeneous scaling is universal, i.e., the same local term
for all almost homogeneous extensions. This is an example for the universality of
the polynomial p(∂) introduced in formulas (3.2.39)–(3.2.40) of Proposition 3.2.16.
More generally, we conclude from that proposition and the Fa`a di Bruno formula
(3.6.25) that the contribution to Zρ is universal for all massless, primitive divergent
diagrams94, in particular for the massless setting sun diagram (see Exer. 3.5.5) and
the box diagrams studied in Exer. 3.6.15 below. This statement holds also for the
following massive example.

m1 and m2, respectively. We aim to compute

Only triangle diagrams (see (3.2.16)) contribute to Z(3)
1ρ and Z(3)
2ρ , for the following reason:
From the proof of the Main Theorem we know that Z(3)

can be written as Z(3)

We are going to show how the computation of the r.h.s. of (3.6.51) can be traced
back to the scaling behaviour of the massless ﬁsh diagram (3.6.49) in both cases j = 1
and j = 2. First note that contraction of tμν 0
2△with gμν yields
tμ 0
2△μ(y) = i δ(4)(y1 −y2) t0
ﬁsh(y1)
(3.6.52)
by using □DF (x) = −iδ(4)(x). Hence, arbitrary almost homogeneous extensions tμν
2△and
tﬁsh satisfy the relation
tμ
2△μ(y) −i δ(4)(y1 −y2) tﬁsh(y1) = C δ(8)(y)
for some
C ∈C ;
obviously, the term on the right side scales homogeneously. We conclude that
(y∂y + 8) tμ
2△μ(y) = i Cﬁsh δ(8)(y) ,
where
y∂y := yλ
1 ∂y1
λ + yλ

Due to Lorentz covariance, the expression (y∂y + 8) tμν
2△(y) must be ∼gμν; hence we
obtain
(y∂y + 8) tμν
2△(y) = i gμν

(3.6.53)
To compute the violation of homogeneous scaling for tμν

˜tμ
△(y) := ∂μDF (y1) DF (y2) DF (y1 −y2)
(3.6.54)
which exists in D′(R8) by the direct extension (3.2.22) and scales homogeneously:
(y∂y + 7) ˜tμ

In D′(R8 \ {0}) we ﬁnd

obviously this change is compatible with our axioms.96 In addition to (3.6.59), we will
use that for the massive ﬁsh diagram tm the violation of homogeneous scaling comes
from the leading term in its Sm-expansion, which is the massless ﬁsh diagram tﬁsh, i.e.,
ρ4 tm/ρ(ρy) −tm(y) = ρ4 tﬁsh(ρy) −tﬁsh(y) = Cﬁsh log ρ δ(y) .
(3.6.60)
This holds for the same reason as (3.6.51).

It remains to compute the number C2. This can be done by setting m := 0. We
write tμν for tμν
m=0. To extend
tμν 0(y) := DF (y) ∂μ∂νDF (y) ∈D′(R4 \ {0}) ,
we use DF (y) =

From this result we conclude that

in the last step. On the other hand, taking the limit m ↓0 of (3.6.58) and using (3.6.61),

Again, we have traced back the task to the breaking of homogeneous scaling of
the massless ﬁsh diagram tﬁsh ≡tM
ﬁsh (3.6.49). If we renormalize the latter with the
renormalization mass scale M := m, our scaling transformation acts also on M: M →
M/ρ. With that, homogeneous scaling is preserved since, e.g., the scaling relation (3.6.62)
is replaced by
(y∂y + 6 −M∂M)tμν M(y) = (−gμνy2 + 4yμyν)

vanishes in that case. But, the choice M := m
violates the Sm-expansion axiom, because the latter requires that the pertinent massless

an example for Remk. 3.2.35.

The algebraic adiabatic limit
References for this section are [24, 27, 52, 55].
Up to now our renormalization group transformations Z ∈R act on interac-
tion functionals F ∈Floc; by Proposition 1.4.3(b) this can be interpreted as an ac-
tion on explicitly spacetime-dependent interaction Lagrangians 
j κjgj(x) Lj(x),
where gj ∈D(M) , Lj ∈Pbal and κj is a coupling constant. We want to ex-
tract from this information the action of the renormalization group on constant
Lagrangians 
j κj Lj ∈Pbal – this is the conventional form of the renormali-
zation group. This requires a kind of adiabatic limit. The usual adiabatic limit
gj(x) →1 ∀x ∈M needs a good infrared behavior (see, e.g., [9, 38, 66, 67, 148]).
This restriction can be avoided by using the framework of algebraic quantum ﬁeld
theory (AQFT), also called “local quantum physics” [94]; for a recent and short
introduction to AQFT we recommend [76].
A brief outline of algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory. AQFT aims to understand struc-
tural properties of relativistic QFT from ﬁrst principles, by focussing on two
aspects of observables: Their localization in space and time and their algebraic
properties.
To explain this more explicitly, we ﬁrst note that formulating a QFT in terms
of ﬁelds, a main disadvantage is that diﬀerent ﬁelds may describe the same physics.
A way to overcome this redundancy is AQFT: The basic idea is to construct the
QFT locally. More precisely, the “net of algebras”, that is, the map
O −→A(O) ,
(3.7.1)
where O runs through all open and bounded regions in Minkowski spacetime and
A(O) is the algebra of observables which can be measured within O, “constitutes
the intrinsic mathematical description of the theory” (citation from [94]). By def-
inition a net is isotonic, that is, it must hold
A(O1) ⊆A(O2)
if
O1 ⊆O2 .
(3.7.2)

3.7.
The algebraic adiabatic limit
243
In AQFT pertinent embeddings, i.e., injective maps
ιO2,O1 : AL(O1) →AL(O2) ,
must be speciﬁed – they contain an essential part of the physical information which
is encoded in the net (3.7.1).
R. Haag and D. Kastler formulated axioms for AQFT [93] – these are phys-
ically motivated conditions on the net (3.7.1). For brevity we only mention “Lo-
cality” (also called “Causality”) and “Poincar´e covariance”:
• Locality: If O1 and O2 are spacelike separated (i.e., (x1−x2)2 < 0
∀(x1, x2) ∈
O1 × O2) and if (O1 ∪O2) ⊆O, then
[ιO,O1(A1) , ιO,O2(A2)]⋆= 0
∀(A1, A2) ∈A(O1) × A(O2) .

• Poincar´e covariance: For each L ≡(Λ, a) ∈P↑

an algebra isomorphism

(3.7.6)
For our purposes it suﬃces to deﬁne the map (3.7.1) for97 open double cones O;
that is, O is of the form
O = (x + V+) ∩(y + V−)
for some pair (x, y) ∈M2 fulﬁlling y ∈(x + V+);
(3.7.7)
see Figure 3.4.
An interaction-free example for an AQFT is the net
O −→A(O) :=

⋆Floc(O) ,
where
Floc(O) := { F ∈Floc


 supp F ⊂O } ,
(3.7.8)
where O runs through all double cones in Minkowski spacetime and 4
⋆means the
algebra, under the ⋆-product, generated by members of the indicated set.
Perturbative algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory. We wish to construct an AQFT,
which is generated by our perturbative interacting ﬁelds (3.1.2) and which goes
over into (3.7.8) when switching oﬀthe interaction. For this purpose let L ∈
Pbal be given, with L = L∗; to simplify the notation, the symbol L includes the
coupling constant κ. We modify (3.7.8) as follows: We replace F ∈Floc(O) by
97The term “double cone” here refers to a bounded region with two conical vertices, rather than
its usual meaning of a pair of funnels meeting at a single conical vertex.

the corresponding interacting ﬁeld FL(g). The latter fulﬁlls the Locality condition
(3.7.3) – as noted in Remk. 3.1.6. This yields the net
O −→AL(O) :=
3
⋆{ FL(g) = R(eL(g)/ℏ
⊗
, F)


 F ∈Floc(O) } ,
(3.7.9)
where g is a real-valued test function98 that is identically 1 on O, precisely:
g ∈G(O) := { g ∈D(M, R)


 g(x) = 1 ∀x in a neighbourhood of O } ,
(3.7.10)
where O is the closure of O. Isotony (3.7.2) of the map (3.7.9) is obvious.
A drawback of this setup is that FL(g) depends on the restriction of g to
O + V −(by causality); but the algebra AL(O) should rather be independent of g.
Il’in and Slavnov [108] and, about 20 years later, Brunetti and Fredenhagen [24]
showed that this is indeed the case.
Theorem 3.7.1 (Independence from adiabatic switching). As an abstract algebra,
AL(g) := 4
⋆{ FL(g)


 F ∈Floc(O) } is independent of the choice of g ∈G(O).
Concretely, for any g1, g2 ∈G(O), there is a unitary99 element Ug1,g2 ∈F[[κ]] such
that
Ug1,g2 ⋆FL(g1) ⋆(Ug1,g2)⋆−1 = FL(g2) ,
for all
F ∈Floc(O) .
(3.7.11)
Proof. Following [24],100 we prove the assertion (3.7.11) for the relative S-matrix
(3.3.31), which is a more general observable:
SL(g)(F) := S

L(g)
⋆−1 ⋆S

L(g) + F

,
F ∈Floc .
(3.7.12)
F −→SL(g)(F) is the generating functional of time-ordered products of the inter-
acting ﬁelds FL(g) (see [66]); in particular we have FL(g) = ℏ
i
d
dλ|λ=0 SL(g)(λF),
see (3.3.30). The relative S-matrix is introduced already in Exer. 3.3.11 and it will
be treated in more detail in (4.2.45) and Remk. 4.2.4.
The proof uses only Causality for time-ordered products in the form of the
relation (3.3.27) and unitarity of the S-matrix.
We split (g2 −g1) into
g2 −g1 = a+b
with
supp a∩(O+V −) = ∅∧supp b∩(O+V +) = ∅. (3.7.13)
From supp L(a) ∩(supp F + V −) = ∅and L(g2) = L(g1 + b) + L(a), we conclude
S

L(g2) + F

L(g2)

L(g1 + b)

,
and, by ⋆-multiplying with S

L(g2)
⋆−1, this gives SL(g2)(F) = SL(g1+b)(F).
98Such a g is often taken to be merely a Schwartz function; but test functions are somewhat
better suited to an eventual promotion of this theory to curved spaces.
99To say that U is unitary means that U∗⋆U = U ⋆U∗= (1, 0, 0, . . . ) in F[[κ]].
100An alternative proof, relying on the axioms for retarded products, can be found in [52].

(Ug1,g2)∗= (Ug1,g2)⋆−1 by using (2.1.10). It is crucial that Ug1,g2 does not depend
on F.
□
Now for L = κL ∈Pbal, let
GL(O) := { G ∈D(M, Pbal)


 G(x) = L(x) ∀x in a neighbourhood of O } (3.7.14)
and we will use the notation

G :=

M G(x) ddx . For example, one could take a
G of the form G(x) = g(x) L(x) with g ∈G(O). To deﬁne the algebraic adiabatic
limit of an interacting ﬁeld F
G (where F ∈Floc(O) , G ∈GL(O)) we proceed as
follows: To get rid of the algebraically irrelevant choice of a G ∈GL(O) we admit
all G ∈GL(O). This idea can be realized by the following deﬁnition.101
Deﬁnition 3.7.2 (Algebraic adiabatic limit). Let O be a double cone and F ∈
Floc(O). The algebraic adiabatic limit with respect to O of the interacting ﬁeld
FL(g) (g ∈D(M)) is the map

The corresponding algebra of observables localized in O is

(3.7.16)
where the operations are deﬁned pointwise:

L (G) + HO
L(G) ,
(F O
L ⋆HO
L)(G) := F O

for all G ∈GL(O).
101Compared with the original paper [24] or with [51, 55], we work here with a somewhat
simpliﬁed deﬁnition of the algebraic adiabatic limit, which is used also in [75].

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Given an inclusion of double cones O1 ⊆O2, we ﬁnd that GL(O2) ⊆GL(O1);
with that an embedding can be deﬁned on the generators by restriction of the
maps (3.7.15):
ιO2,O1 :

F O1
L
−→F O2
L
= F O1
L


GL(O2) ,
(3.7.17)
where F ∈Floc(O1) ⊆Floc(O2). For F, H ∈Floc(O1) this deﬁnition of the embed-
ding gives


=

F G2 ⋆H G2

G2∈GL(O2) .
Usually the restriction of a map is not injective. Nevertheless, ιO2,O1 is injective,
as it must be for an embedding, for the following reason: If we know F O
L (G0)
for one G0 ∈GL(O), we know F O
L (G) for all G ∈GL(O), namely, F O
L (G) =
UG0,G ⋆F O
L (G0) ⋆(UG0,G)⋆−1 due to Theorem 3.7.1.
Obviously, the embeddings (3.7.17) satisfy the consistency condition
iO3,O2 ◦iO2,O1 = iO3,O1
for
O1 ⊆O2 ⊆O3 .
The so-constructed net
AL : O −→AL(O)
(3.7.18)
fulﬁlls the Haag–Kastler axioms of algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory [93], except that
there is no suitable norm available on these formal power series. For details we refer
to the mentioned references. We only verify Locality and Poincar´e covariance: For
the former let O1, O2 and O be as in (3.7.3) and let F O1
L
∈AL(O1), HO2
L ∈AL(O2);
then we get
[ιO,O1(F O1
L ) , ιO,O2(HO2
L )]⋆(G) = [F O1
L (G), HO2
L (G)]⋆= [F
G, H
G]⋆= 0
for all G ∈GL(O), by using the spacelike commutativity of the interacting ﬁelds
(Remk. 3.1.6) in the last step.
Turning to Poincar´e covariance, it suﬃces to deﬁne the isomorphism αO
L
(L ∈P↑
+) for the generators F O
L of AL(O). To do this, we ﬁrst note that the
isomorphism102 βL ≡βΛ,a : F −→F (introduced in (3.1.35)) induces an iso-
morphism βO
L : F(O) −→F(LO). Any G ∈GL(O) is a ﬁnite sum of the form
G(x) = 
s gs(x) Ls(x) with Ls ∈Pbal , 
s Ls = L and gs ∈G(O). We assume
that all Ls are scalar with respect to Lorentz transformations. Introducing the
bijection
βO
L,L :

GL(O) −→GL(LO)

s gs(x) Ls(x) −→
s gs(L−1x) Ls(x) ,
102We recall from (3.1.37) that βL : F −→F is an algebra isomorphism with respect to both the
classical and the star product.

L with the embed-

(hence GL(LO2) ⊆GL(LO1)), taking into account also the deﬁnition of βO
L,L, we
get
βLO1
L−1,L(G) = βLO2
L−1,L(G) ∈GL(O2) ⊆GL(O1)

Hence, we may write

Following a standard procedure in AQFT (see, e.g., [51]), the algebra Aloc
L of
“all local observables” is obtained by the inductive limit of the algebras AL(O).
This limit is not the set theoretic union ∪O AL(O); it is deﬁned in terms of the
disjoint union

which is a union of ordered pairs, the union runs through all open double cones O.
On this set we consider the equivalence relation “∼” generated by the embeddings:

A, O

ιO1,O(A), O1

The inductive limit is the resulting set of equivalence classes,

∼,
(3.7.19)
which is an algebra. In particular, denoting the equivalence class of (A, O) by
[(A, O)], the product is deﬁned by
[(A1, O1)] ⋆[(A2, O2)] :=
#
ιO,O1(A1) ⋆O ιO,O2(A2) , O
$
,
where O is an open double cone containing O1∪O2 and ⋆O is the product in AL(O).
The action of the Poincar´e group on the algebra Aloc
L is deﬁned in an obvious way:

L
[(A, O)] −→
#

(3.7.20)
for all L ∈P↑
+. By means of the weak adiabatic limit one can construct a vacuum
state on Aloc
L , this is explained in (A.6.20).
Remark 3.7.3. The adiabatic switching of the coupling constant(s), i.e., the re-
placement of κ by κg(x) , g ∈D(M), can be interpreted as an IR-regularization of
the model. Hence, it might be that the results which one obtains in the adiabatic
limit g(x) →1 ∀x ∈M depend on this regularization method. Even if the adia-
batic limit exists and is unique in the sense of Epstein and Glaser (see App. A.6),
it might be that another IR-regularization method – e.g., by giving the originally
massless ﬁelds a tiny mass m > 0 and performing the limit m ↓0 in the end –
yields diﬀerent results. This does certainly not hold for the algebraic structure ob-
tained in the algebraic adiabatic limit, that is, the net (3.7.18), since this structure
is independent of the IR-behaviour of the model.
But, for the construction of physically relevant scattering states on the alge-
bras AL(O), the algebraic adiabatic limit does not suﬃce, one has to perform the
adiabatic limit in the sense of Epstein and Glaser (see App. A.6 and the references
[9, 38, 66, 67] and [148, Sects. 3.11-3.12]), which is hard work.

By the latter property we mean
dn,l,p,aπ(Aπ(1) ⊗· · · ⊗Aπ(n)) = dn,l,p,a(A1 ⊗· · · ⊗An) ,
aπ := (aπ(1), . . . , aπ(n)) ,
for all π ∈Sn. The upper bounds L, Pl, αl ∈N depend on (A1, . . . , An), in par-
ticular the sums are ﬁnite for a ﬁxed (A1, . . . , An), and for l = 0 we have Pl = 0.
In addition, for A1, . . . , An ∈Pbal∩Phom it holds that dn,l,p,a(A1⊗· · ·⊗An) ∈

shows the dependence of L and αl on (A1, . . . , An).
Proof. Let A1, . . . , An ∈Pbal be given. The idea is to combine the Wick expansion
(3.6.9) with the Sm-expansion (3.6.3)–(3.6.4). For this purpose we write Aj ∈Pbal

z:

κ Pbal[[κ]] −→κ Pbal[[κ]]
κL −→z(κL) = κL + O(κ2) ,
(3.8.5)
which is the renormalization of the interaction in the algebraic adiabatic limit. The
latter statement will be explained more in detail later on by means of Theorem
3.8.6 (given in Sect. 3.8.3). The map z (3.8.5) is universal, in the sense that it does
not actually depend on the region O; note also that z is uniquely determined by
Z, that is, by a pair (T, T) or (R, R).

The correspondence γ : R −→γ(R) ; Z −→z is actually a homomorphism. In
other words, it satisﬁes
γ(Z2 ◦Z1) = γ(Z2) ◦γ(Z1) ,
(3.8.6)
for the following reason:103 for G ∈GκL(O) we have Z1( G) =  G1 with G1 ∈
Gγ(Z1)(κL)(O), and Z2(

G1) =

G2 with G2 ∈Gγ(Z2)(γ(Z1)(κL))(O). Since

G2 =
Z2 ◦Z1(

G), we also have G2 ∈Gγ(Z2◦Z1)(κL)(O). Hence the following diagram is
commutative:
Gγ(Z1)(κL)(O)
GκL(O)
Gγ(Z2)◦γ(Z1)(κL)(O) = Gγ(Z2◦Z1)(κL)(O)
Z1
Z2
Z2 ◦Z1
The property (3.8.6) implies that
γ(Z2) ◦γ(Z1) ∈γ(R) ,
Idκ Pbal[[κ]] = γ(IdFloc) ∈γ(R)
and
γ(Z)−1 = γ(Z−1) ∈γ(R)
for all Z1, Z2, Z ∈R. That is, γ(R) is also a group: This is the renormalization
group in the adiabatic limit. We point out that we obtain this group without really
performing the adiabatic limit g(x) →1 (for all x); the algebraic adiabatic limit
suﬃces for this purpose.
By performing the latter limit, we arrive at the conventional formulation of
the renormalization group as a renormalization of the coupling constants – the
maps z ∈γ(R) can be interpreted in this way, see Exap. 3.8.2 and Sect. 3.8.2.
Let L ∈Pbal ∩Phom. From (3.8.2) and (3.8.4) we immediately ﬁnd:
dim L ≤d
=⇒
dim z(κL) ≤d ,
(3.8.7)
where d is the number of spacetime dimensions and by dim z(κL) we mean the
maximum of the mass dimensions of all ﬁeld monomials contributing to the for-
mal power series z(κL), analogously to (3.2.63). Hence, a renormalizable (by power
counting) interaction remains renormalizable under a renormalization group trans-
formation. For a massless model we obtain a stronger result:104
L ∈Pbal ∩Pd =⇒z(κL) ∈Pbal ∩Pd
for
m = 0 .
(3.8.8)
Example 3.8.2 (Renormalization of ϕ4
d=4). An important example is the renormalization
of L = ϕ4 in d = 4 dimensions. Since Z ∈R fulﬁlls the “Field parity” condition,
z(κϕ4) contains solely terms which are even in ϕ. Taking into account also the properties
103For simplicity we hide κ in G.

dim A = j.

For the massless ϕ4

linear combination of the ﬁelds ϕ4 and

(∂ϕ)2 −ϕ□ϕ

. Alternatively, this result can be
obtained by performing the limit m ↓0 of formula (3.8.9).
To give an explicit computation we study, as in Sect. 3.6.3, the scaling as re-
normalization transformation and assume m > 0. We use the stronger version of the
Sm-expansion axiom. From (3.6.44) and (3.6.21) we know that

the St¨uckelberg–Petermann group (Deﬁnition 3.6.1) and the polynomial dependence of

on log ρ (see (3.6.47)). The p4 □□δ-term is the breaking of homogeneous scaling
of (DF )4|renormalized, which is ∼log ρ according to Proposition 3.2.16. Next we insert the
values for Cﬁsh (3.6.49) and K1, . . . , K4, the latter are computed in Exer. 3.5.5.
Turning to the algebraic adiabatic limit, we compute dn=2,l,p,a=0(ϕ4 ⊗ϕ4) for l =
0, 2, 4. This is obvious for the terms without derivatives of δ(y). The terms m2 P2(. . .) □δ
and p4 □□δ do not contribute, since we are interested in the (a = 0)-terms only. With
regard to the K2 □δ ϕϕ-term we take into account that dn,l,p,a(ϕ4 ⊗ϕ4) ∈Pbal and write

The functions ρ −→ζ(ρ), ρ −→ξ(ρ) and ρ −→χ(ρ) are called the “running coupling

, χ(ρ) is a polynomial in the
two variables log m
M and log ρ, to each order in κℏ. In the next section we will see that
the mass renormalization is of a much simpler form, if χ(ρ) does not depend on m, i.e.,
does not contain any powers of log m
M . As we see, this assumption is not fulﬁlled when we
work with the stronger version of the Sm-expansion axiom. But, at least to order (κℏ)2,
it can be satisﬁed if we require only the weaker version of this axiom. Namely, in this

Wave function, mass and coupling constant renormalization
In this subsection, we follow essentially [27, Sect. 7, App. C], see also [65].
In general the renormalized interaction z(κL) (3.8.5) contains novel interac-
tion terms. For a renormalizable (by power counting) interaction it is possible to
absorb

z(κL)−κL

by redeﬁnitions of the ﬁeld (“wave function renormalization”),

256

the mass (“mass renormalization”) and the coupling constant (“coupling con-
stant renormalization”), that is, after these redeﬁnitions106 the total Lagrangian

L0 −zρ(κL)

has the same form as the initial one

L0 −κL

.
We work out these concepts in terms of two models: Massive ϕ4
d=4 and mass-
less ϕ3
d=6 with the scaling as renormalization transformation. The interesting prop-
erty of the latter model is that the “β-function”, which describes the change of
the renormalized (or “running”) coupling constant under scaling, is < 0 to leading
order – this exhibits asymptotic freedom.107
The massive ϕ4

, formula (3.8.13) suggests that the renormalization group ﬂow has
3 parameters: ζ(ρ) for the ϕ4-component, ξ(ρ) for the

(∂ϕ)2 −ϕ□ϕ

≃2(∂ϕ)2-
component and χ(ρ) for the m2ϕ2-component. However, the model has only two
physically relevant parameters: The renormalized coupling constant κρ and the
renormalized (or “running”) mass mρ; this can be seen by performing the wave
function, mass and coupling constant renormalization. In detail: Introducing a new
ﬁeld ϕρ, which is of the form
ϕρ(x) := f(ρ) ϕ(x)
(3.8.18)
(where f : (0, ∞) −→R is a suitable function), and the running mass mρ and the
running coupling constant κρ, we can achieve that

The condition (3.8.19) is an equation for polynomials in ϕ, ∂ϕ; equating the
coeﬃcients the implicit deﬁnition (3.8.19) of the running quantities turns into the
following explicit formulas:
106We recall that L0 denotes the free Lagrangian.
107Asymptotic freedom is the property that the interaction between particles becomes weaker
as the distance between the particles decreases; asymptotically they behave as free particles.
Asymptotic freedom is a feature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the QFT of the strong
interaction between quarks and gluons.

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Remark 3.8.4 (“Perturbative agreement”). By the renormalization of the wave
function and mass, we change the splitting of the total Lagrangian

L0 −zρ(κL)

into a free and interacting part, i.e., we change the starting point for the pertur-
bative expansion. To justify this, one has to show that the two perturbative QFTs
given by the splittings

L0 −zρ(κL)

and

L0,ρ −κρLρ

(the latter is a shorthand
notation for the r.h.s. of (3.8.19)), respectively, have the same physical content.
This statement can be viewed as an application of the “Principle of Perturba-
tive Agreement” of Hollands and Wald, which is used in [103] as an additional
renormalization condition.
A proof that the “old” perturbative QFT (given by

L0 + zρ(L)

) and the
“new” one (given by

L0,ρ −κρLρ

) are physically equivalent, is beyond the scope
of this book. Using the framework of perturbative algebraic QFT (introduced in
Sect. 3.7), the following conjecture has been formulated and veriﬁed for a few
examples [26]: Given a renormalization prescription (i.e., a T -product) for the
old perturbative QFT, there exists a renormalization prescription for the new
perturbative QFT, such that the pertinent nets of local observables in the algebraic
adiabatic limit are equivalent. The corresponding isomorphisms can be chosen such
that local ﬁelds are identiﬁed with local ﬁelds modulo the free ﬁeld equation. For
recent progresses see [172] and [37].
Obviously, a necessary condition in order that the requirement L0−zρ(κL) =
L0,ρ −κρLρ can be fulﬁlled is that dim zρ(κL) = dim L; for a renormalizable (by
power counting) interaction (i.e., dim L = d) the latter condition is satisﬁed, due
to (3.8.7).
The massless ϕ3
d=6-model. For simplicity we assume m = 0. In d = 6 dimensions
Deﬁnition 3.1.18 yields
dim ϕ = 2
and it holds that
DF (y) =
1
4π3 (y2 −i0)2 ,
(3.8.24)
the latter formula can be found, e.g., in [27, App. A].

The massless ϕ3

coupling constant κρ, because the ξ(ρ)

the free part of the Lagrangian by the wave function renormalization. Proceeding

In contrast to the ϕ4

108We replace κ by κ/3! , in order that we can better compare with the literature.

3.8.
The renormalization group in the algebraic adiabatic limit
261
in [127], although the renormalization group ﬂow generated by scaling is deﬁned
there by a diﬀerent method, namely by conventional dimensional regularization109
with minimal subtraction, which is a momentum space method.
Usually, the sign of the β-function is positive, as, e.g., for the ϕ4
4-model; this
means that the strength of the interaction increases if we study the model at
smaller distances. However, for the ϕ3
6-model β(κ) is negative to leading order –
this is an indication for asymptotic freedom.

Let t1 ∈D′(M6) be an almost homogeneous extension of t0

3.2.16 and the Lorentz invariance, the breaking of homogeneous scaling of t1 is of
the form
ρ∂ρ

ρ8 t1(ρy)

= a1 □yδ(y) .
(3.8.32)
The computation of the constant a1 ∈C can be traced back to the breaking of
homogeneous scaling of a simpler extension problem, namely the extension of
t0(y) :=
1
(y2 −i0)3 ∈D′(M6 \ {0})
to
t ∈D′(M6) .
Applying diﬀerential renormalization to (3.5.9), we get an explicit formula for t:

(3.8.33)
To obtain the constant a1 appearing in (3.8.32) from this result, we multiply
(3.8.32) with y2: On the l.h.s. we use that
y2 t1(y) = t(y) + a2 δ(y)
for some a2 ∈C, since both y2 t1(y) and t(y) are almost homogeneous extensions
of t0(y). Hence, the l.h.s. gives
y2 ρ∂ρ

ρ8 t1(ρy)

ρ6 t(ρy)

= iπ3 δ(y) .
The r.h.s. turns into
a1 y2 □yδ(y) = a1 (□yy2) δ(y) = a1 12 δ(y) .
109Here, we do not mean dimensional regularization in the Epstein–Glaser framework, which
proceeds in position space, as worked out in [63].

Next we rewrite t0

Now, G ∈R12×12 is invertible and symmetric and one veriﬁes that 2 of the eigen-
values of G are > 0 and the other 10 are < 0. Therefore, G is diagonalizable by
an orthogonal matrix R ∈O(12): RT G R = diag(d1, . . . , d12); in addition, one can
choose R such that d1, d2 > 0 and d3, . . . , d12 < 0. Deﬁning

Field renormalization
In Sect. 3.8.1 we have seen that, in the algebraic adiabatic limit, the renormaliza-
tion of the interaction κL(g) −→Z

κL(g)

can be interpreted as a renormalization
z (3.8.5) of (constant) ﬁeld polynomials. This holds true also for the renormaliza-
tion of the ﬁeld A(h) −→Z′

A(h) (3.6.40), where A ∈Pbal, h ∈D(M).

(3.8.41)
(Notice that the diﬀerentiated polynomials on the right-hand side need no longer
be balanced.)
We have thereby arrived at a linear map
z(1)(κL):

Pbal −→P[[κ]]
A −→z(1)(κL)A = A + O(κ) ,
(3.8.42)
which is universal, i.e., independent of O, and is uniquely determined by Z or
(R, R).
Let L, A ∈Pbal ∩Phom. From (3.8.2) and (3.8.41) we conclude
dim L ≤d
=⇒
dim z(1)(κL)A = dim A ,
(3.8.43)
where d is the number of spacetime dimensions and dim z(1)(κL)A is understood
similarly to dim z(κL) in (3.8.7). In a massless model solely the terms with l = 0
and p = 0 contribute to the expansion (3.8.1); therefore we obtain:
L ∈Pd ∩Pbal ∧A ∈Pj ∩Pbal
=⇒
z(1)(κL)A ∈Pj ,

The map z(1)(κL) (3.8.42) may be called the ﬁeld renormalization in the

(see Exer. 3.6.11), goes over, in the algebraic adiabatic limit, to the following
theorem (cf. [27, Thm. 6.5], which is a reﬁnement of results derived in [55, 102]).
Theorem 3.8.6 (Algebraic renormalization group equation). Let

AκL(O) and
AκL(O) denote the algebra of observables localized in the double cone O (3.7.16)
which are obtained by using the renormalization prescriptions (i.e., retarded pro-
ducts) R and R, respectively. In addition, let Z ∈R be the unique renormalization
group transformation relating R and R by formula (3.6.39); and let z = γ(Z)
(3.8.5) and z(1)(κL) (3.8.42) be the pertinent renormalization of the interaction
and ﬁeld, respectively, in the algebraic adiabatic limit. This Z induces an isomor-
phism βZ = (βO
Z )O from the net AκL to the net Az(κL), that is, the maps
βO
Z : 
AκL(O) −→Az(κL)(O) ,
(3.8.45)
are algebra-isomorphisms which satisfy
ιO2,O1 ◦βO1
Z
= βO2
Z ◦ˆιO2,O1
for all
O1 ⊆O2 ,
(3.8.46)
where ˆιO2,O1 and ιO2,O1 are the embeddings (3.7.17) belonging to the nets 
AκL
and Az(κL), respectively. On the generators (i.e., the interacting ﬁelds in the alge-
braic adiabatic limit, see (3.7.15)–(3.7.16)) the isomorphisms βO
Z are given by the
relation

for all double cones O, all A, L ∈Pbal, and all h ∈D(O).
In order that the nets 
AκL and Az(κL) describe the same physics, it does
not suﬃce that the algebras 
AκL(O) and Az(κL)(O) are isomorphic for all O, the
compatibility with the embeddings, i.e., the relation (3.8.46), must also be fulﬁlled
for a suitable choice of the isomorphisms βO
Z .
Note also that for a nontrivial Z ∈R it may happen that γ(Z)(κL) = κL
for some L ∈Pbal, and even then the pertinent net-isomorphism βZ is in general
nontrivial, see [55, Thm. 5.1].

(f O

Z−1 : Gγ(Z)(κL)(O) −→Gγ(Z−1)◦γ(Z)(κL)(O) = GκL(O) .
The main point of the proof is that we have shown that any R

271
3.9
A version of Wilson’s renormalization group
and of the ﬂow equation
In this section we essentially follow [27, Sect. 5.2] and [61].
3.9.1
Outline of the procedure
The renormalization group (RG) in the sense of Wilson [171] relies usually on a
functional integral approach; it describes the dependence of the theory on a cutoﬀ
Λ, which one introduces to avoid UV-divergences.110 A major example for an UV-
regularization is a discretization of Minkowski spacetime, that is, UV-ﬁniteness
is achieved by replacing the Minkowski space by a lattice. IR-divergences are
avoided by a ﬁnite extension of the lattice. Setting Λ := {lattice constant}−1,
the “continuum limit” Λ →∞of the suitably renormalized functional integral
(i.e., Λ-dependent counter terms are added) yields an approach for the model
in Minkowski spacetime, or in a ﬁnite subvolume of the Minkowski space if the
extension of the lattice is kept ﬁnite.
Another UV-regularization method is to modify the (Feynman) propagator
by cutting oﬀthe momenta above a scale Λ. It is rather obvious how to do this
for a massive model on a Euclidean space (in place of the Minkowski space), see
Exap. 3.9.2 and, e.g., [147]; however, in Minkowski spacetime such a momentum
cutoﬀis more tricky [112] – see Exap. 3.9.3.
Regularized Feynman propagator yields regularized S-matrix. We imitate Wil-
son’s RG in the framework of causal perturbation theory by picking up the idea
of regularizing the Feynman propagator: Let (pΛ)Λ>0 be a family of smooth func-
tions, pΛ ∈C∞(Rd), which approximates ΔF
m, as roughly introduced in Remk.
3.3.3. More precisely we assume111
lim
Λ→∞pΛ = ΔF
m
in the H¨ormander topology [27, 107],
(3.9.1)
and for Λ →0 it is required that
p0 := lim
Λ↓0 pΛ = 0
in the H¨ormander topology.
(3.9.2)
110In the conventional literature one mostly needs also an IR-cutoﬀ, to ensure IR-ﬁniteness.
In causal perturbation theory the test function g, which switches the interaction, acts as an
IR-cutoﬀ. Since, in this section, we do not study the adiabatic limit g(x) →1, IR-ﬁniteness is
guaranteed. So we concentrate on the UV-behaviour.
111Necessary conditions for limΛ→∞pΛ = p in the H¨ormander topology are:
• Convergence in the weak topology of D′(Rd) (A.1.15) (or S′(Rd), resp.), and
• convergence in E(K) for each compact set K ⊂Rd which does not intersect the singular
support of p (see (A.3.1) for the deﬁnition of the latter). For the non-expert reader:
convergence in E(K) means that (pΛ −p) and all its derivatives converge to 0 uniformly
on K.

272
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
Motivated by ΔF
m(−z) = ΔF
m(z), we additionally assume that
pΛ(−z) = pΛ(z)
∀z ∈Rd .
(3.9.3)
Why do we choose the H¨ormander topology? Convergence in D′(Rd) (or
S′(Rd), resp.) is too weak for the proof of Theorem 3.9.4 below. The latter proof
uses the following:112 if t1,Λ ∈D′(Rk) , t2,Λ ∈D′(Rl) and limΛ→∞tj,Λ = tj
for j = 1, 2, then limΛ→∞t1,Λ · t2,Λ = t1 · t2 , where the appearing products of
distributions are a mixture of the tensor product and the pointwise product and
we assume that these products exist. Convergence in the H¨ormander topology
suﬃces for this relation.
We introduce the regularized time-ordered product of nth order:
TΛ,n :

F⊗n −→F
TΛ,n(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn) := F1 ⋆Λ · · · ⋆Λ Fn ,
where
⋆Λ := ⋆pΛ
(3.9.4)
is deﬁned in Exer. 2.3.1. Due to (3.9.1)–(3.9.2), ⋆Λ interpolates between the point-
wise (or “classical”) product (1.2.5) (Λ = 0) and the unrenormalized time-ordered
product ⋆ΔF (3.3.10) (Λ = ∞). Apart from the much larger domain, TΛ,n is ob-
tained from the unrenormalized T -product (3.3.10) by replacing ΔF
m by pΛ. In
contrast to the latter product and to the product τn (2.3.10), TΛ,n is well deﬁned
on the whole space F⊗n, because pΛ ∈C∞(Rd). We also point out that the def-
inition (3.9.4) uses associativity of ⋆Λ, which follows from the equivalence to the
classical product, shown in Exer. 2.3.1 (formula (2.3.3)).
The generating functional of the regularized time-ordered product is the reg-
ularized S-matrix:
SΛ :

F −→F
SΛ(F) := 1 + ∞
n=1
in
ℏn n! TΛ,n(F ⊗n) =: eiF/ℏ
⋆Λ
.
(3.9.5)
The expression eiF/ℏ
⋆Λ
is a suggestive shorthand notation for the series. In contrast
to the exact S-matrix S (Deﬁnition 3.3.8), the domain of SΛ is F (and not only
Floc) and SΛ is invertible with respect to “◦” (composition of maps), as shown
below in Sect. 3.9.2. Since ⋆Λ is associative and commutative, the factorization
SΛ(F + G) = SΛ(F) ⋆Λ SΛ(G)
(3.9.6)
holds true for all F, G ∈F.
For F ∈Floc the limit Λ →∞of SΛ(F) does not exist in general – conver-
gence in an appropriate sense can be achieved by adding suitable, Λ-dependent,
local counter terms to the interaction F; essentially this is the message of Theorem
3.9.4.
112I thank Urs Schreiber for pointing this out [151, Chap. 16].

Eﬀective potential and ﬂow equation. Very heuristically, the idea of an eﬀective
potential VΛ at scale Λ113 can be explained as follows: We interpret Λ as an energy
scale and pΛ as propagator with an UV-cutoﬀat energy Λ. Now we split the
“quantum eﬀects” (more precisely, the degrees of freedom to be integrated out
in a functional integral approach) into the ones above Λ and the ones below Λ.
The former are taken into account by replacing the original interaction V by the
eﬀective potential VΛ, and the latter are considered in the application of SΛ (i.e.,
the S-matrix with an energy cutoﬀat Λ) to VΛ.
So we deﬁne VΛ as a function of V = κL(g) (where g ∈D(M) and L ∈Pbal
is the interaction Lagrangian) by the condition that the cutoﬀtheory SΛ with
interaction VΛ agrees with the exact theory S with interaction V , that is:
Deﬁnition 3.9.1. [27] The eﬀective potential VΛ ∈F at scale Λ ≥0 is deﬁned by
SΛ(VΛ) := S(V ) ,
or explicitly
VΛ ≡VΛ(V ) := S−1
Λ ◦S (V ) .
(3.9.7)
We point out that in general VΛ is a non-local interaction.
The problem with this Deﬁnition is that usually S is unknown. Therefore, one
computes VΛ by solving Polchinski’s ﬂow equation [112, 137, 147], which is a dif-
ferential equation for VΛ and can be derived from Deﬁnition 3.9.1 (see Sect. 3.9.3);
it has the form
d
dΛVΛ = FΛ(VΛ ⊗VΛ) ,
(3.9.8)
where the map FΛ : F⊗2 −→F is linear and explicitly known. Integration of the
ﬂow equation yields VΛ, the integration constants are determined by appropri-
ate boundary values. The non-uniqueness of the latter corresponds to the non-
uniqueness of S in Deﬁnition 3.9.1.
From VΛ the S-matrix may be obtained by the limit limΛ↓0 eiVΛ(V )/ℏ= S(V ),
with respect to the pointwise convergence in F (1.2.3). Heuristically, this can be
seen as follows: Inserting p0 = 0 into (3.9.5) we get S0(F) = eiF/ℏ(the exponential
series with respect to the classical product), hence
S−1
0 (1 + F) = ℏ
i log(1 + F) := ℏ
i

F −1
2 F · F + 1
3 F · F · F −· · ·

which gives V0(V ) = ℏ
i log ◦S(V ).
Deﬁnition 3.9.1 implies the relation
VΛ = WΛ,Λ0(VΛ0)
for
WΛ,Λ0 := S−1
Λ ◦SΛ0 ,
(3.9.9)
113In Sect. 3.9 we denote the interaction by the letter “V ” instead of “S”, to avoid confusion
with the letter S denoting the S-matrix. Following the naming in [27] and [147] we use the name
“eﬀective potential” in the framework of causal perturbation theory and the name “eﬀective
action” for the corresponding quantity in the functional integral approach (the latter is sketched
in Sect. 3.9.5).

that is, WΛ,Λ0 is the “ﬂow of the eﬀective potential from Λ0 to Λ”. In the functional
integral approach the ﬂow is usually deﬁned for Λ ≤Λ0 only; hence, it is non-
invertible. In our framework this restriction does not appear: WΛ,Λ0 is well deﬁned
for all Λ, Λ0 ∈[0, ∞) and
W −1
Λ,Λ0 = S−1
Λ0 ◦SΛ = WΛ0,Λ
exists. The set of ﬂow operators,
W := {WΛ,Λ0 | Λ, Λ0 ∈[0, ∞)} ,
(3.9.10)
is a version of Wilson’s RG. The “product”
WΛ,Λ1 ◦WΛ1,Λ0 = WΛ,Λ0
is again a ﬂow operator. However, (W, ◦) is in general not a group in the mathe-
matical sense, since WΛ1,Λ2 ◦WΛ3,Λ4 does not lie in W for Λ2 ̸= Λ3. In the func-
tional integral approach the situation is even worse, due to the non-invertibility
of the ﬂow; nevertheless one can interpret Wilson’s RG as a “semigroup”, see,
e.g., [147, Chap. 3].
3.9.2
The regularized S-matrix
Proof of invertibility. First we prove the above-claimed invertibility of SΛ (3.9.5)
with respect to the composition of maps:
Proof. As shown in Exer. 2.3.1 the product ⋆Λ is equivalent to the classical pro-
duct:
F ⋆Λ G = τΛ (τ −1
Λ F · τ −1
Λ G)
where
τΛ := eΓpΛ ,
τ −1
Λ
:= e−ΓpΛ
(3.9.11)
and the notations (2.3.1)–(2.3.2) are used. With that SΛ can be written as
SΛ = τΛ ◦exp ◦i
ℏτ −1
Λ
,
where
exp F := 1 + F + F · F/2! + · · · ,
(3.9.12)
from which it is obvious that SΛ is invertible:
S−1

(3.9.13)
□
For Λ ↓0 we have limΛ↓0 pΛ = p0 = 0, which gives limΛ↓0 τΛ = τ0 = Id.
Hence we obtain

(3.9.14)
Here and in the following, convergence of a family (MΛ) of maps MΛ : F −→F is
meant in the pointwise sense, that is, MΛ(F)(h) converges in C for all F ∈F and
for all h ∈C.

Explicit examples for UV-regularizations. We are going to give two examples for
UV-regularizations of the (Feynman) propagator. Since we will use Fourier trans-
formation, we work with distribution spaces S′(. . .) in place of D′(. . .).
Example 3.9.2 (Scalar Euclidean QFT with mass m > 0). The Epstein–Glaser renorma-
lization can be formulated also for scalar quantum ﬁeld theories on spaces of Euclidean
signature; this is worked out in [113]. For non-coinciding points the “Euclidean time-
ordered product” E(m)

is the n-fold product ⋆p with propagator
p(x) :=

More precisely, let E be Rd with the Euclidean metric and let ˇEn := {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈
En | xl ̸= xj ∀l < j}. Then
E(m)

A1(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗An(xn)

on S(ˇEn)
(3.9.16)
for all A1, . . . , An ∈P, analogously to Lemma 3.3.2(b). Similarly to Minkowski spacetime,
the expression on the r.h.s. of (3.9.16) is not deﬁned on S(En); for example, for d = 4 the
powers p(x)j , j ≥2, exist only in S′(Rd \{0}) but not in S′(Rd). Again, renormalization
is the extension to coinciding points. In the Epstein–Glaser construction of the sequence
(E(m)
n
)n∈N∗(more precisely, proceeding by induction on n and requiring Translation
covariance (3.1.40) and Field independence, i.e., the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24)),
renormalization amounts to the extension of distributions e0 ∈S′(Rd(n−1) \ {0}) to
e ∈S′(Rd(n−1)).
However, replacing the propagator p ∈S′(Rd) by a smooth function pΛ ∈C∞(Rd),
the r.h.s. of (3.9.16) is well deﬁned on S(En). Since for any distribution f ∈S′(Rd),
compactness of the support of its Fourier transform ˆf implies smoothness of f,114 we
can obtain an UV-regularized propagator pΛ from p by cutting oﬀthe momenta above a
scale Λ > 0:
ˆpΛ(k) :=
1
(2π)d/2 (k2 + m2) K
 k2
Λ2
	
∈S(Rd) ,
k2 := k2
0 + ⃗k 2 ,
(3.9.17)
where K is a smooth version of a step function: Following [147] we require that K ∈
C∞(R+
0 , [0, 1]) with
K(x) =

0
if
x ≥4
1
if
x ≤1
and K′(x) < 0 ∀x ∈(1, 4).
We are going to verify that this pΛ satisﬁes the above-made assumptions. Since
ˆpΛ(k) ∈S(Rd) we have pΛ(x) ∈S(Rd),115 and ˆpΛ(−k) = ˆpΛ(k) implies pΛ(−x) = pΛ(x).
We easily see that
lim
Λ→∞ˆpΛ(k) = ˆp(k) ,
lim
Λ→0 ˆpΛ(k) = 0
(3.9.18)
114Actually, “rapid decay in all directions” of ˆf suﬃces for smoothness of f, see App. A.3.
115In the examples treated here, the regularized propagator, pΛ(x) (3.9.17) or pε,Λ(x) (3.9.21),
is not only smooth, as required, it has the additional nice property that it decays rapidly, which
is advantageous for some technical purposes.

with respect to the weak topology of S′(Rd). Due to continuity of the inverse Fourier
transformation from S′(Rd) to S′(Rd), these convergence statements hold also in x-space
with respect to the weak topology. One can show that they are valid also with respect
to the H¨ormander topology in x-space.
To give a more explicit impression with what kind of objects we are dealing, we
derive x-space formulas for the Euclidean propagator pd ≡p, by computing the inverse
Fourier transformation (3.9.15). Due to rotation symmetry, pd(x) depends only on |x| :=

x2
0 + ⃗x 2; hence, we may assume x = (|x|,⃗0). We ﬁrst compute the k0-integral, that is,

for d ≥2. In low dimensions the remaining integral can easily be computed: For d = 2, 3
we obtain
p2(x) = (2π)−1 K0(m |x|)
(where K0 is a modiﬁed Bessel function of second kind) and
p3(x) = 1

respectively. In d = 4-dimensions the computation of this integral is more diﬃcult, it
results
p4(x) =

m2x2

+ m2 f1(−m2x2) ,
where x2 := x2
0 + ⃗x 2 and f, f1 are the analytic functions deﬁned in (2.2.4) and (2.2.5),
respectively. For a general d ≥2 the result reads
pd(x) = (2π)−d/2  m
|x|
	d/2−1
Kd/2−1(m|x|) .
These formulas agree with the analytic continuation of the corresponding formulas for
the Wightman two-point function in the Minkowski space; for example, p4(x) is obtained
from the formula for Δ+ (d=4)
m
(x) (2.2.3) by replacing x0 by ix0.
Obviously, the propagators p2, p3 and p4 have an integrable singularity at x = 0
and p2, p3 decay exponentially for |x| →∞.
Example 3.9.3 (ε-regularized relativistic theory with m > 0). This example is taken from
[112], for simplicity we assume d = 4.
ε-regularization of the relativistic theory means that the Minkowski metric is re-
placed by
iηε := i diag(ε −i, ε + i, ε + i, ε + i)
with
ε > 0 .
With that we have
kηεk := k2
0 (ε −i) + ⃗k 2 (ε + i) .

Note that kηεk ̸= 0 for k ̸= 0 and that
Re (kηεk + (ε + i)m2) = ε (k2
0 + ⃗k 2 + m2) ≥ε m2
∀k ∈R4 .
(3.9.19)
The Feynman propagator pε of the ε-regularized relativistic theory is deﬁned in momen-
tum space by the formula
ˆpε(k) :=
1
(2π)2 
kηεk + (ε + i)m2 .
(3.9.20)
For ε ↓0 the family (ˆpε)ε>0 of analytic functions converges to the Minkowski space
Feynman propagator,
lim
ε↓0 ˆpε(k) =
i
(2π)2 (k2 −m2 + i0) ≡ˆΔF
m(k) ,
with respect to the weak topology of S′(Rd) and, hence, this holds also in x-space:
limε↓0 pε(x) = ΔF
m(x) in S′(Rd). Whether this holds even with respect to the H¨ormander
topology is a more diﬃcult question, which is not yet answered – as far as we know.
Since ˆpε(k) does not rapidly decay for ∥k∥→∞, pε(x) is non-smooth. Therefore,
we introduce, for ﬁxed ε > 0, an UV-cutoﬀΛ for the propagator pε (3.9.20), by an
exponential damping in momentum space:
ˆpε,Λ(k) := e−Λ−2
kηεk+(ε+i)m2
ˆpε(k) =
−i
(2π)2
 ∞
Λ−2 dα e−α

kηεk+(ε+i)m2
,
(3.9.21)
where we take into account (3.9.19). We see that pε,Λ(−x) = pε,Λ(x) and that ˆpε,Λ(k) ∈
S(Rd), which implies pε,Λ(x) ∈S(Rd). Note that we need both ε > 0 and Λ < ∞in order
that pε,Λ(x) is smooth, as required for a regularization of the Feynman propagator.
We are now going to study the behaviour of pε,Λ(x) for Λ →∞and Λ →0,
respectively, where ε > 0 is ﬁxed. We claim
lim
Λ→∞pε,Λ(x) = pε(x)
and
lim
Λ→0 pε,Λ(x) = 0
with respect to the weak topology of S′(Rd) and also with respect to the H¨ormander
topology. Very roughly this can be seen as follows: Using (3.9.19) we get
|ˆpε,Λ(k)| = e−Λ−2 ε (k2
0+⃗k 2) e−Λ−2 ε m2 |ˆpε(k)| .
(3.9.22)
The ﬁrst factor on the r.h.s. is a Euclidean momentum cutoﬀ, similarly to the function
K

k2
0+⃗k 2
Λ2
	
in the regularized Euclidean propagator (3.9.17); therefore, the convergence
behaviour for Λ →∞is essentially the same as in the Euclidean case treated above.
For Λ →0 the behaviour of pε,Λ(x) is dominated by the prefactor e−Λ−2 ε m2, which is
the second factor on the r.h.s. of (3.9.22) and remains unchanged under inverse Fourier
transformation.
Which axioms hold also for SΛ? Although TΛ,n and Tn have diﬀerent domains, it
makes sense to investigate whether the axioms deﬁning (Tn)n∈N∗(Sect. 3.3.2) are
preserved under the regularization, i.e., are valid also for (TΛ,n)n∈N∗.
Obviously, TΛ,n : F⊗n −→F satisﬁes the basic axioms Linearity, Initial
condition and Symmetry; the latter relies on (3.9.3). But Causality does cer-
tainly not hold with respect to the usual star product ⋆Δ+, because pΛ(x) ̸=

θ(x0) Δ+(x) + θ(−x0) Δ+(−x). Nevertheless, TΛ,n respects Causality in the fol-
lowing sense: Using associativity of ⋆Λ we get116

The point is that for {x1, . . . , xk} ∩

{xk+1, . . . , xn} + V −

= ∅the product ⋆Λ of
the two TΛ-products on the r.h.s. can be interpreted as an approximation of ⋆Δ+,
because the arguments of the pertinent propagators pΛ fulﬁll (xj−xl) /∈V −(where
1 ≤j ≤k , k+1 ≤l ≤n) and on D(Rd\V −) it holds that limΛ→∞pΛ = ΔF = Δ+,
as we know from (2.3.9).
Turning to the renormalization conditions, we ﬁrst note that Field indepen-
dence (and, hence, the causal Wick expansion) is satisﬁed: For TΛ,2 this is an
immediate consequence of the deﬁnition of ⋆Λ (2.1.5); and due to associativity,
more precisely TΛ,n(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn) = TΛ,n−1(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn−1) ⋆Λ Fn, the (n = 2)-
reasoning can be used to verify the statement for (TΛ,n)n≥3 by induction on n.
It is easy to see that TΛ,n fulﬁlls also the renormalization conditions Transla-
tion covariance, Field parity (the equivalent formulation (3.1.34) holds obviously
true), ℏ-dependence and the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation in integrated form, that is,
formula (3.3.20) with pΛ in place of ΔF
m . Concerning the latter note that gener-
ically it holds that (□+ m2)pΛ(x) ̸= −iδ(x), since pΛ is smooth; therefore, TΛ,n
violates the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation in diﬀerential form, by which we mean

Generically an UV-cutoﬀbreaks homogeneous scaling and the Lorentz in-
variance of the (Feynman) propagator; e.g., the preceding Exaps. 3.9.2 and 3.9.3
fulﬁll
ρd−2 pρ−1m,Λ(ρx) = pm,ρΛ(x) ̸= pm,Λ(x) ;
(3.9.23)
and for ε > 0 the propagators pε (3.9.20) and pε,Λ (3.9.21) are not Lorentz in-
variant. Therefore, TΛ,n usually fails to satisfy the renormalization conditions Sm-
expansion and Lorentz covariance. But the axiom Scaling degree (i.e., the condition
(3.2.62) with t(A1, . . . , An) in place of r(A1, . . . , An)), which is weaker than the
Sm-expansion axiom, is trivially satisﬁed by TΛ,n. Namely, because

116As we know from Exer. 3.3.10, this formula can be understood as an equivalent reformulation
of the factorization (3.9.6) of SΛ.

As a simple application, we prove that the eﬀective potential VΛ (3.9.7) fulﬁlls
Field parity and Translation covariance: These symmetries for SΛ,

respectively. Since S satisﬁes also these symmetries, we obtain

for γ = α and γ = βa , ∀V ∈Floc .
Consistent scheme for addition of local counter terms such that cutoﬀcan be
removed. Widespread, traditional renormalization methods in pQFT work with
a regularization of the S-matrix to avoid UV-divergences (cf. Remk. 3.3.3), e.g.,
dimensional regularization or Pauli–Villars regularization. It is a main and deep
result of perturbative renormalization, that convergence of the limit removing the
cutoﬀcan consistently be achieved, by adding suitable local counter terms to the
interaction.
Causal perturbation theory does neither involve any regularization nor diver-
gent counter terms. Nevertheless, the following theorem states that any solution S
of our axioms (given in Sect. 3.3.2) can be obtained by starting with a regularized
S-matrix SΛ of type (3.9.5), adding suitable, local counter terms to the interaction
and ﬁnally performing the limit Λ →∞which removes the cutoﬀ. The addition
of local counter terms is consistent, that is, it yields the wanted convergence of
the limit Λ →∞simultaneously for all orders n of TΛ,n and for all arguments
F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn ∈F⊗n
loc . The theorem states also that the addition of local coun-
ter terms can be described by an element ZΛ of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann RG.
More precisely, we mean here the larger version R0 of this group (introduced in
Remk. 3.6.6) belonging to the renormalization conditions valid for SΛ (since we
want to maintain these properties in the addition of local counter terms), that
is, Field independence, Translation covariance, Field parity, ℏ-dependence, and
Scaling degree; for simplicity we omit the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation.
Theorem 3.9.4 (Addition of local counter terms). Given
• an arbitrary solution S of the axioms for T -products – here we mean the
complete set of axioms or a subset which contains the axioms deﬁning R0 –
• and an approximation (pΛ)Λ>0 of the Feynman propagator fulﬁlling the above-
assumed properties (see Sect. 3.9.1),
there exists a family ZΛ ∈R0 such that
lim
Λ→∞SΛ ◦ZΛ = S .
(3.9.24)
Convergence of this limit is understood in the following sense: limΛ→∞SΛ ◦ZΛ(0)
= S(0) = 1 and, for all k ∈N∗and for all monomials A1, . . . , Ak ∈P, the

Convergence in this sense implies convergence in the pointwise sense:

(3.9.27)
To see this we may use the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24) for S(k) and also for
(SΛ ◦ZΛ)(k); the latter is allowed since SΛ and ZΛ satisfy Field independence and,
hence, this holds true also for (SΛ ◦ZΛ)(k) for all k ≥1. We may assume that

and for S(k)(V ⊗k)(h) we get an analogous formula, the only diﬀerence is that
tΛ(A1, . . . , Ak) is replaced by t(A1, . . . , Ak). Since convergence of the limit
limΛ→∞tΛ(A1, . . . , Ak) = t(A1, . . . , Ak) in the H¨ormander topology implies con-
vergence of the same limit in the weak topology of D′(Rd(k−1)) (A.1.15) (as already
mentioned in Footn. 111), we obtain the assertion (3.9.27).
⊟
If not any solution S (of the considered axioms) is given, we nevertheless
know that such a solution exists (as explained in Sect. 3.3.2) and, in this case, the
theorem says that given an approximation (pΛ)Λ>0 of the Feynman propagator,
there exists a consistent addition of local counter terms to the interaction (which
can be described by a family ZΛ ∈R0) such that we obtain a solution of our axioms
when removing the cutoﬀ; and any solution of our axioms can be obtained this way.
To explain the scheme of cancellation of divergences we write out SΛ ◦ZΛ(F)

removes the “subdivergences” of TΛ,3(F ⊗3),
that is, the divergences of TΛ,3(F ⊗3) localized on partial diagonals, which come
from divergent subdiagrams; and Z(3)
Λ (F ⊗3) removes the “overall divergences” of
TΛ,3(F ⊗3) localized on Δ3.
This theorem was ﬁrst formulated in [27] and proved in [63, App. A]. The
proof proceeds by an inductive construction of the sequence (Z(n)
Λ ), which is anal-
ogous to the proof of part (a) of the Main Theorem – it also relies on the Fa`a
di Bruno formula (3.6.25) (in a somewhat modiﬁed form). But, the diﬃcult step
is to show that the so-constructed ZΛ lies in R0. On the level of the C-number
distributions (which depend on the relative coordinates) this can be done by using
the W-projection (3.2.29):
Wω :

D(Rdn) −→Dω(Rdn)
Wωh(x) := h(x) −
|a|≤ω wa(x) (−1)|a| ⟨∂aδ, h⟩
(3.9.28)
for ω ≥0. In [63, App. A] the C-number distributions are introduced by an
expansion of the (regularized) S-matrix as a sum over (Feynman) diagrams; here
we proceed diﬀerently: The C-number distributions are the coeﬃcients in the
causal Wick expansion (3.1.24).
Proof 118. We are going to construct the sequence (Z(n)
Λ )n∈N, where Z(n)
Λ
∈ℏV[[ℏ]]
(3.6.19) for n ≥2, by induction on n. More precisely, we construct the truncations
ZΛ,n ∈R of ZΛ (3.6.17) by induction on n such that
lim
Λ→∞(SΛ ◦ZΛ,n)(k) = S(k)
∀k ≤n
(3.9.29)
with convergence in the above-explained sense.
Due to the requirement ZΛ ∈R, we set Z(0)
Λ
:= 0 and Z(1)
Λ
:= Id; as discussed
for the Main Theorem (see the explanations above (3.6.21)), these values satisfy
(3.9.29) for n = 0 and n = 1.
Let (3.9.29) hold true for a certain n ≥1. We are searching a Z(n+1)
Λ
∈ℏV[[ℏ]]
such that
lim
Λ→∞(SΛ ◦ZΛ,n+1)(n+1) = S(n+1) .
(3.9.30)
Note that limΛ→∞(SΛ ◦ZΛ,n+1)(k) = S(k) ∀k ≤n is satisﬁed for any Z(n+1)
Λ
,
because (SΛ ◦ZΛ,n+1)(k) = (SΛ ◦ZΛ,n)(k) for k ≤n.
We construct Z(n+1)
Λ
by means of the causal Wick expansion (3.6.9); due
to that, the condition Field independence on ZΛ,n+1 (3.6.5) will be satisﬁed. Let

Taking into account (3.9.28), we explicitly see that (i) is indeed satisﬁed.
Summing up, the soconstructed ZΛ,n+1 fulﬁlls the following deﬁning condi-
tions on an element of R0: The Analyticity (1), the Lowest orders property (2) and
the Field independence (4) (all three required in Deﬁnition 3.6.1) and, in addition,
the Locality and Translation covariance (3.6.30) and the Scaling degree property
(3.6.32).
Also the remaining deﬁning conditions of R0 – Field parity and ℏ-dependence
– hold true for ZΛ,n+1. Namely, since ZΛ,n has these properties by induction and
SΛ satisﬁes the corresponding axioms, we conclude that
tΛ,n(A1, . . . , An+1) = 0
if

that z(n+1)
Λ
fulﬁlls the properties Field parity (3.6.8) and ℏ-dependence (3.6.6).
Veriﬁcation of (ii): We will prove that
lim
Λ→∞tΛ,n(A1, . . . , An+1) ◦Wω(A1, . . . , An+1)
= t0(A1, . . . , An+1) ◦Wω(A1, . . . , An+1)
in the H¨ormander topology. Because for both tΛ,n(A1, . . . , An+1) and t0(A1, . . .
. . . , An+1) the extension from D′(Rdn \ {0}) to D′
ω(Rdn) is uniquely given by the
direct extension (see (3.2.26)), it suﬃces to show that
lim
Λ→∞tΛ,n(A1, . . . , An+1)(y) = t0(A1, . . . , An+1)(y)
on
D(Rdn \ {0}) (3.9.34)
in the H¨ormander topology. For this purpose we note that the open cover ∪ICI =
Mn+1 \ Δn+1 (3.3.16) can also be written as an open cover in the relative coordi-

C0
I = Rdn \ {0}
where
C0
I := {y ∈Rdn 

 yi −yj /∈V −∀i ∈I, j ∈Ic}
with
yn+1 := 0 .
So we have to verify (3.9.34) on each D(C0
I ). To simplify the notations, we do this
for the case I = {1, . . . , k} with 1 ≤k ≤n.
To compute t0(A1, . . . , An+1)|D(C0
I ), we take into account that T 0
n+1|D(CI) is
given by (3.3.17). Inserting the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24) for T|I| and T|Ic|
into that formula and computing the star product, we obtain the following formula
on D(C0
I ):
t0(A1, . . . , An+1)(y) =

where ir ∈I, jr ∈Ic for all r and nR
(ir),(jr),(ar) is a combinatorial factor. Here, we
have used that Δ+(y) = ΔF (y) for y /∈V −(2.3.9).
To get an analogous formula for tΛ,n(A1, . . . , An+1) on D(C0
I ), we use the
formulation (3.6.33) of locality of ZΛ,n and the factorization (3.9.6) of SΛ to obtain
(SΛ ◦ZΛ,n)(F + G) = SΛ

ZΛ,n(F) + ZΛ,n(G)

= (SΛ ◦ZΛ,n)(F) ⋆Λ (SΛ ◦ZΛ,n)(G)
if
supp F ∩supp G = ∅.
Proceeding similarly to the second part of the solution of Exer. 3.3.10, we conclude
that

all l ∈N∗. Therefore, taking the VEV of (3.9.36) we obtain

L(g)

g ∈D(M) ,
(3.9.38)
exists without adding any counter terms, it can be performed in a naive way by replacing
pΛ by ΔF
m. This statement follows directly from the deﬁnition of an UV-ﬁnite interaction.
Alternatively, it is also contained in the theorem given here: The reasons yielding the
relation Z

L(g)

= L(g) (3.6.37) hold not only for all Z ∈R, they hold even for all Z
lying in the larger version R0 of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann group appearing here; hence,
formula (3.9.24) reduces to (3.9.38) when applied to an UV-ﬁnite L(g).
As an application of Theorem 3.9.4 we are going to explain, how one can
construct the Gell-Mann–Low cocycle Zm
ρ
∈R (3.6.44) from the counter terms
Zm
Λ ∈R0 [27, Sect. 5.2]. Proceeding analogously to Exer. 3.1.21(a), we derive from
the scaling behaviour of pm,Λ (3.9.23) the relation
σρ(F ⋆ρ−1m,Λ G) = (σρF) ⋆m,ρΛ (σρG)
where
⋆m,Λ := ⋆pm,Λ ,
which implies
σρ ◦Sm/ρ
Λ
◦σ−1
ρ
= Sm
ρΛ .
(3.9.39)
Using that a scaling transformation commutes with the limit Λ →∞in (3.9.24),
we get

Assuming that the convergence behaviour is suﬃciently well, we replace the “di-
agonal limit” limΛ1=Λ→∞· · · by limΛ→∞limΛ1→∞· · · . Taking into account addi-
tionally that limΛ1→∞Sm
ρΛ1 ◦Zm
ρΛ1 = Sm and that Sm is injective, we conclude
that
Zm
ρ = lim
Λ→∞(Zm

(3.9.40)
In this way the Gell-Mann–Low cocycle Zm

3.9.3
Eﬀective potential and ﬂow equation
Comments on the deﬁnition of the eﬀective potential. To explain more in detail
the deﬁnition of the eﬀective potential VΛ (Deﬁnition 3.9.1), we recall that SΛ is
explicitly known and invertible and that S exists (although it is usually unknown).
With that the eﬀective potential VΛ at scale Λ is well deﬁned by (3.9.7). We also
recall that in general VΛ ̸∈Floc. Similarly to S(V ), VΛ can be viewed as a formal
power series in ℏ, or in κ (since V ∼κ), or in both. For the lowest terms of the
expansion in κ we obtain
VΛ(V ) := S−1
Λ ◦S (V ) = V + O(κ2) ,
(3.9.41)
by using the axiom (ii) Initial condition and (3.9.13).
The limit Λ ↓0 of VΛ is unproblematic, from (3.9.14) we see that
lim
Λ↓0 VΛ = ℏ
i log ◦S(V ) = S−1
0
◦S (V ) ≡V0(V ) ≡V0
(3.9.42)
in the pointwise sense (1.2.3). This can equivalently be written as
eiV0(V )/ℏ= lim
Λ↓0 eiVΛ(V )/ℏ= S(V ) .
(3.9.43)
That is, eiVΛ/ℏis an approximation for the S-matrix S(V ) for small Λ > 0.
We point out that the construction of VΛ requires renormalization, since VΛ
is deﬁned in terms of the renormalized S-matrix. In the functional integral ap-
proach [112, 147], the corresponding renormalization is performed by introducing
an UV-cutoﬀΛ0. The so regularized eﬀective potential is a 2-parametric family

GΛ,Λ0(V )

Λ≤Λ0. The existence of the limit Λ0 →∞of GΛ,Λ0(V ) (which removes
the UV-cutoﬀΛ0) requires the addition of suitable, Λ0-dependent, local counter
terms to V . Roughly, the so renormalized, Λ-dependent family

lim
Λ0→∞
i
ℏGΛ,Λ0(V + Λ0-dependent, local counter terms)

Λ>0
corresponds to our eﬀective potential VΛ, for details see Sect. 3.9.5.
Remark 3.9.6. In general, the limit limΛ→∞VΛ(V ) does not exist; here and in the
following also this limit is understood in the pointwise sense (1.2.3). On a heuristic
level, convergence can be achieved by adding suitable, Λ-dependent, local counter
terms. By means of Theorem 3.9.4 this can be described as follows: Let ZΛ ∈R0
be an addition of local counter terms yielding that S-matrix S which is used in the
deﬁnition of VΛ(V ), that is, limΛ→∞SΛ ◦ZΛ = S in the pointwise sense (3.9.27).
With that we get

cancel in the limit Λ →∞.
To second order in κ, the relation (3.9.45) holds true for all interactions
V ∼κ, as we show below by explicit computation of (VΛ ◦Z−1
Λ )(2)(V ⊗2). But, to
third order in κ the limit limΛ→∞(VΛ ◦Z−1
Λ )(3)(V ⊗3) does in general not exist,
see Exer. 3.9.8(b).
Flow equation. Adapting Wilson’s concept of renormalization group and eﬀective
Lagrangian to renormalization of a perturbative ﬁeld theory, Polchinski developed
the ﬂow equation [137]. It is the basis of a powerful method for statistical mechanics
and QFT on Euclidean space, which is very useful for conceptual issues, e.g. an
investigation of “perturbative renormalizability” of a given interaction;119 for an
introductory overview see [147]. The method was extended to perturbative QFT on
Minkowski spacetime by Keller, Kopper and Schophaus [112]. The ﬂow equation
(also called “Renormalization Group equation”) is a diﬀerential equation for the
eﬀective potential as a function of the UV-cutoﬀΛ.
In our framework, the ﬂow equation is obtained by computing the derivative
d
dΛ of the eﬀective potential VΛ by using Deﬁnition 3.9.1; comparing with the
traditional literature (see, e.g., [147]) it corresponds to the “ﬂow equation in Wick
ordered form”.

Construction of VΛ by solving the ﬂow equation inductively. Usually S is un-
known, only V = κL(g) (with L ∈Pbal , g ∈D(M)) and (pΛ)Λ>0 are given, and
from that VΛ is computed by solving the ﬂow equation. In perturbation theory
this amounts to an inductive construction of VΛ as a formal power series in κ:

A major problem is the determination of the integration constants by suitable
boundary values. Usually the value (3.9.42) at Λ = 0 does not help, because it
contains the unknown S. Comparing with the deﬁnition of VΛ

122On a heuristic level, the relation (3.9.62) can be obtained much faster: From S = SΛ◦ZΛ+o(Λ)

Λ

Regularized S-matrix with UV- and IR-cutoﬀand its relation to the ﬂow ope-

0 + ⃗k2. Following [112, 147] this can be
done as follows: The propagator
pΛ,Λ0 := pΛ0 −pΛ
(0 < Λ ≤Λ0 < ∞)
(3.9.66)
has an UV-cutoﬀΛ0 and an IR-cutoﬀΛ; the double limit Λ0 →∞and Λ →0 of
pΛ,Λ0 converges to ΔF
m in the H¨ormander topology.

τΛ,Λ0 := eΓpΛ,Λ0 .
(3.9.68)
To ﬁnd a relation between SΛ,Λ0 and the ﬂow operator WΛ,Λ0 we ﬁrst study
the special case Λ = 0. In this case we have p0,Λ0 = pΛ0, hence S0,Λ0 = SΛ0.
Taking into account also S−1

(3.9.70)
which is a generalization of (3.9.69) due to τ0 = eΓp0 = Id (see (2.3.2)). We point
out that the maps F −→WΛ,Λ0(F) and F −→ℏ
i log ◦SΛ,Λ0(F) (where F ∈F)
agree up to a similarity transformation by τΛ .
Exercise 3.9.10. Prove the assertion (3.9.70).

which is equivalent to the assertion (3.9.70).]
3.9.5
Comparison with the functional integral approach
In this section we give a kind of translation of quantities introduced in our for-
malism into the functional integral approach. Our formalism corresponds to a
functional integral in Minkowski spacetime, which is mathematically much more
problematic than a Euclidean functional integral. To avoid these mathematical
diﬃculties, we compare our formalism with a Euclidean functional integral. To in-
troduce the latter, we study, for simplicity, the model of one real, massive, scalar
ﬁeld on the Euclidean space Rd. We assume that the reader is familiar with the
basics of the functional integral approach, as introduced, e.g., in [147]. To a far
extent, this section is based on that reference, also concerning the notations.

294
Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
We point out: Similarly to the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld formalism developed in this book,
the functional integral approach does not use the Fock space; it works with ﬁeld
conﬁgurations being not restricted by any ﬁeld equation.
Let CE be the conﬁguration space of a Euclidean real scalar ﬁeld ϕ(x) on Rd.
More precisely, we require CE ⊂C∞(Rd, R) and, in order that the action123
S(h) :=

,
j ∈N∗,
is well deﬁned for all h ∈CE, we also require that the conﬁgurations h ∈CE
decay suﬃciently fast for |x| →∞. In contrast to causal perturbation theory, the
interaction is not adiabatically switched oﬀ, i.e., κ is not multiplied with g(x)
(where g ∈D(M)). We assume m > 0. Similarly to (1.1.2), the basic ﬁeld ϕ(x)
is the evaluation functional on CE and the deﬁnitions (1.1.3) and (1.1.4) are used
also in the framework at hand.
In the functional integral approach, the eﬀective action GΛ,Λ0(h), h ∈CE, is
deﬁned as follows: Let dμpΛ,Λ0 (h) be the Gaussian measure given by the covariance
(i.e., propagator) pΛ,Λ0, which is a smooth approximation of the Euclidean propa-
gator (3.9.15). To be explicit, let pΛ,Λ0 be given in terms of pΛ by (3.9.66), with pΛ
deﬁned in (3.9.17). We assume that the measure is normalized:

dμpΛ,Λ0 (h) = 1.
In addition let κ V (Λ0) be the interaction;124 we assume that V (Λ0)(h) is a poly-
nomial in h. Further important explanations about V (Λ0) are given below. With
that, GΛ,Λ0(h), is deﬁned by the functional integral125
eGΛ,Λ0(h) :=
	
dμpΛ,Λ0 (h) e−κV (Λ0)(h+h) ,
h ∈CE .
(3.9.72)
Since pΛ,Λ0 contains an UV-cutoﬀΛ0 and an IR-cutoﬀΛ, we may heuristically
say that the “degrees of freedom in the region Λ2 < k2 ≤Λ2
0 of momentum space
are integrated out”. In order that the functional integral (3.9.72) is well deﬁned,
we assume that κ ≥0 and that V (Λ0)(ϕ) is bounded below. This assumption may
be dropped, if κ is a formal parameter. Then, the functional integral (3.9.72) is
understood in the sense of formal perturbation theory, that is, as a formal power
series in κ:
eGΛ,Λ0(h) = 1 +
∞

n=1
(−κ)n

dμpΛ,Λ0(h)

V (Λ0)(h + h)
n .
(3.9.73)
We take this point of view.
123By “△” we mean the Laplace operator: △:= ∇· ∇.
124In this section we change the notation a bit: The factor κ (for the coupling constant), which
is contained in V in the preceding sections, is written explicitly.
125The condition for the conﬁgurations that the action must be ﬁnite is used only for the “back-
ground ﬁeld” h and not for the conﬁgurations h over which we integrate.

3.9.
A version of Wilson’s renormalization group and of the ﬂow equation
295
Graphically eGΛ,Λ0(h) is the sum of all Feynman diagrams with vertices
κV (Λ0), internal lines symbolizing pΛ,Λ0 and external lines symbolizing the ﬁeld
conﬁguration h. By using the linked cluster theorem (treated in formula (4.4.2)
and Exer. 4.4.2), we conclude that GΛ,Λ0(h) is the sum of all connected Feynman
diagrams of this kind.
The interaction V (Λ0) is usually local and depends on Λ0, since it is normally
ordered with respect to pΛ,Λ0 (or p0,Λ0) and because it contains Λ0-dependent
local counter terms as explained in (3.9.74)–(3.9.75) below. Normal ordering may
be deﬁned by induction on the number of ﬁelds: Ωp(1) := 1, Ωp

So for the ϕj-model the unrenormalized interaction (i.e., without counter terms)
reads
Ωp(V )(h) =

ϕ(x)j
(h) =

∀h ∈CE .
Computing
∂
∂Λ of the functional integral (3.9.72) one derives the ﬂow equa-
tion. Let G(n)
Λ,Λ0 be that term of GΛ,Λ0 which is of nth order in κ. The ﬂow equation
expresses
∂G(n)
Λ,Λ0
∂Λ
in terms of lower-order terms G(k)
Λ,Λ0 , k < n, similarly to (3.9.54).
Hence, also here, the ﬂow equation can be solved by induction on n:

where
∂G(n)

is expressed in terms of inductively known terms by the ﬂow equa-
tion. There appears the crucial question, how to choose the boundary value GΛ0,Λ0;
that is V (Λ0), since
GΛ0,Λ0 = −κV (Λ0) ,
as we see from pΛ0,Λ0 = 0 and (3.9.72). Choosing for V (Λ0) the unrenormalized,
normally ordered interaction Ωp(V ), the limit limΛ0→∞GΛ,Λ0 (understood in the
pointwise sense analogously to (1.2.3)) does not exist in general, due to the usual
UV-divergences. Analogously to Theorem 3.9.4, one can achieve that this limit
exists by adding suitable Λ0-dependent local counter terms to Ωp(V ):
−κV (Λ0) = −κ Ωp(V ) + κ2 · [Λ0-dependent local counter terms] .
(3.9.74)

Chapter 3.
Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
An interaction is called “perturbatively renormalizable” if a ﬁnite number of coun-
ter terms suﬃces for convergence of this limit, where each counter term may be
a formal power series in κ. For example, the ϕ4-interaction in d = 4 dimensions
is perturbatively renormalizable in this sense, since only three counter terms are
required:

• τΛ,Λ0 and SΛ,Λ0 as functional integrals: Let τΛ,Λ0 be deﬁned as in (3.9.68).
For F ∈F
(τΛ,Λ0F)(h)
corresponds to
	
dμpΛ,Λ0(h) F(h + h) ,
h ∈CE , (3.9.76)
since both expressions are the sum over all possible contractions of ϕ in F(ϕ)
with propagator pΛ,Λ0 and ﬁnally each uncontracted ϕ is replaced by h, see
the explanation after Exer. 2.3.1.
Moreover, let SΛ,Λ0 be the regularized S-matrix with propagator pΛ,Λ0.
Then, for V ∈F,
SΛ,Λ0(κV )(h)
corresponds to
	
dμpΛ,Λ0 (h) e−κ ΩpΛ,Λ0 (V )(h+h),
(3.9.77)
since for both expressions the term ∼κn is the sum over all contractions
(with propagator pΛ,Λ0) between n vertices, each vertex given by V and,
again, in the end each uncontracted ϕ is replaced by h. We point out that
in the functional integral self-contractions of a vertex (i.e., tadpoles) drop
out due to the normal ordering of V with respect to pΛ,Λ0. Note also that,
in contrast to (3.9.72), the interaction V in the functional integral (3.9.77)
is localized (since V ∈F); this adiabatic switching oﬀdoes not cause any
problems.126
Even for F, V ∈Floc all expressions in (3.9.76) and (3.9.77) are well
deﬁned (that is, renormalization is not needed at this level), since pΛ,Λ0 ∈
C∞(Rd).

• Eﬀective potential and eﬀective action: Our “eﬀective potential” is related
to the “eﬀective action” (3.9.72) of the functional integral approach, to wit,
i
ℏVΛ(κV ) := i
ℏS−1
Λ ◦S(κV ) corresponds roughly to GΛ,∞:=
lim
Λ0→∞GΛ,Λ0 ,
(3.9.78)
where again the limit is understood in the pointwise sense. The factor “i”
appearing in this correspondence is due to the fact that VΛ is the eﬀective
potential of a relativistic QFT, whereas GΛ,Λ0 is the eﬀective action of a
Euclidean QFT. For Λ = 0 the expressions (3.9.78) agree (apart from the
diﬀerent frameworks): Namely in our formalism we have the value
eiV0(κV )(h)/ℏ= S(κV )(h) ,
(3.9.79)
as we know from (3.9.43); this is a main justiﬁcation to interpret VΛ(κV ) as
eﬀective potential. On the other side, the functional integral
lim
Λ0→∞eG0,Λ0(h) =
lim
Λ0→∞
	
dμp0,Λ0 (h) e−κV (Λ0)(h+h)
(3.9.80)
gives also the renormalized S-matrix to the interaction κV , evaluated at the
ﬁeld conﬁguration h ∈CE. Here we assume that the pointwise limit Λ ↓0
exists and may be computed by setting Λ = 0. Since we assume m > 0,
this assumption is usually satisﬁed, in particular this holds true for the ϕ4-
interaction in d = 4 dimensions.
• UV-ﬁnite models: To investigate the connection between VΛ(V ) and GΛ,∞
for Λ > 0, i.e., to clarify the statement (3.9.78), we make the simplifying
assumption that the interaction V is UV-ﬁnite, as introduced in Exap. 3.6.9.
For such an interaction, V (Λ0) (3.9.74) depends on Λ0 only by normal order-
ing. If the latter is done with respect to pΛ,Λ0, that is, V (Λ0) = ΩpΛ,Λ0(V ),
we see from (3.9.72) and (3.9.77) that
SΛ,Λ0(κV )(h)
corresponds to
eGΛ,Λ0(h) .
(3.9.81)
From (3.9.38) we know that
S(κV ) =
lim
Λ0→∞SΛ0(κV ) .
(3.9.82)
Taking into account these relations and (3.9.71), we see that GΛ,∞corre-
sponds to the pointwise limit

Λ0→∞log ◦SΛ,Λ0(κV ) =

Λ0→∞log ◦τ−1
Λ
◦SΛ0 ◦τΛ(κV )

◦S ◦τΛ(κV ) .
(3.9.83)
In the last step we use that under the map τΛ UV-ﬁniteness of κV is main-
tained. The result (3.9.83) is equal to

Chapter 4
Symmetries –
the Master Ward Identity
For this chapter the references are [16, 17, 53, 54]. However, at ﬁrst sight, [53] diﬀers
quite a lot from the presentation given here.127
A fundamental problem in the quantization of a classical ﬁeld theory is that,
in general, not all classical symmetries can be maintained: Due to the distributional
character of quantum ﬁelds the arguments valid for classical ﬁeld theory cannot
be applied. In the inductive construction of the retarded or time-ordered product
(given in Sect. 3.2 or 3.3, resp.) the decisive step, in which classical symmetries
can be violated, is the extension to the thin diagonal, see Sects. 3.2.2 and 3.2.7.
Therefore, symmetries are renormalization conditions, as mentioned in Sect. 3.1.4.
In Sect. 3.2.7 we have shown that symmetries with respect to a group G
can be maintained in the extension to the thin diagonal, if all ﬁnite-dimensional
representations of G are completely reducible. However, physically important sym-
metries are not of this kind, e.g., scaling symmetries, the conservation of certain
currents and gauge (or BRST [7, 8, 164]) invariance.
Therefore, in this chapter, we return to the maintenance of symmetries in the
process of quantization, from a general point of view: The Master Ward Identity
(MWI) is a universal formulation of symmetries – it is the straightforward gener-
alization to QFT of the most general classical identity for local ﬁelds which can
be obtained from the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation and the fact that classical ﬁelds may
be multiplied pointwise. It is a highly nontrivial renormalization condition, which
cannot always be fulﬁlled due to the well-known anomalies appearing in QFT.
In conventional renormalization methods (e.g., BPHZ renormalization or di-
mensional regularization) the question whether certain Ward identities can be
preserved in the process of renormalization, is usually analyzed by means of the
127It is impossible to formulate the Master Ward Identity if the arguments of the R- (or T -)
products are pure on-shell ﬁelds. In [53] the arguments of the T-products are on-shell ﬁelds,
however, generalized by an additional, symbolical derivative (“external derivative”) with respect
to which the free ﬁeld equations do not hold.

Chapter 4. Symmetries – the Master Ward Identity
Quantum Action Principle (QAP), which was derived by Lowenstein [125] and
Lam [119], and proved in several renormalization schemes, e.g., in dimensional
regularization [15]. The QAP characterizes the possible violations of Ward identi-
ties; it can be used to derive necessary and suﬃcient conditions for the existence
of a renormalization maintaining the Ward identities. The solvability of these
conditions frequently amounts to cohomological questions involving the inﬁnites-
imal symmetry operators which appear in the considered Ward identities. This
program is called “algebraic renormalization”, for an overview and a bunch of
applications we refer to the book [135]. We will prove a version of the QAP in
terms of the “anomalous MWI” (Sect. 4.3) and we will mimic the procedure of
algebraic renormalization for the MWI in the framework of causal perturbation
theory (Sects. 4.4–4.5).
4.1
Derivation of the Master Ward Identity
in classical ﬁeld theory
The deﬁning property (ii) of a retarded wave operator (Deﬁnition 1.6.2) is the oﬀ-
shell ﬁeld equation. We start with its perturbative formulation (1.7.7) or (1.9.11):
Rcl

eS
⊗, δ(S0 + S)
δϕ(x)

=
δS0
δϕ(x) .
(4.1.1)
Let Q ∈P. We multiply (4.1.1) with Rcl

eS
⊗, Q(x)

and use the perturbative
formulation (1.7.6) of the crucial factorization property (1.6.5) of classical ﬁelds:
Rcl

eS
⊗, Q(x) · δ(S0 + S)
δϕ(x)

= Rcl

eS
⊗, Q(x)

· Rcl

eS
⊗, δ(S0 + S)
δϕ(x)

= Rcl

eS
⊗, Q(x)

·
δS0
δϕ(x) ,
(4.1.2)
where “ · ” means the classical product. This is the “Master Ward Identity” (MWI).
A crucial point is that the right-hand side vanishes “modulo the free ﬁeld equa-
tion”, i.e., when restricted to CS0.
To write the MWI in the form given in [16, 17, 54], we introduce the functional
A =
	
dx
K

i=1
hi(x) Qi(x) δS0
δϕ(x)
with
K < ∞,
Qi ∈P ,
(4.1.3)
and arbitrary test functions hi ∈D(M); and a corresponding derivation
δ⃗h· ⃗Q :=
	
dx
K

i=1
hi(x) Qi(x)
δ
δϕ(x) .
(4.1.4)

4.2.
The Master Ward Identity as a universal renormalization condition
301
Obviously we may write A = δ⃗h· ⃗QS0. With that we obtain from (4.1.2) the MWI
for the symmetry given by ⃗Q and the interaction S:
Rcl

eS
⊗, (A + δ⃗h· ⃗QS)

=
	
dx
K

i=1
hi(x) Rcl

eS
⊗, Qi(x)

·
δS0
δϕ(x) ∈J ,
(4.1.5)
where J ≡J(m) (2.6.2) is the ideal of (F, · ) generated by the free ﬁeld equation.
By construction, the particular case K = 1, Q = 1 must give the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld
equation (4.1.1) smeared out with h(x); this holds indeed true since Rcl

eS
⊗, 1

= 1.
Remark 4.1.1. Obviously the functional A given in (4.1.3) is an element of J ∩
Floc. Vice versa, we conclude from (1.3.8) and (2.6.2) that every A ∈J ∩Floc
can be written in the form (4.1.3). But, it may happen that the Qi are not
uniquely determined by A. E.g., for a complex scalar ﬁeld (see Exap. 1.3.2) we have
S0 =

dx

∂μφ∗(x)∂μφ(x) −m2 φ∗(x)φ(x)

; with that, A :=

dx h(x)
δS0
δφ(x) (□+
m2)φ(x) can also be written as A =

dx h(x)
δS0
δφ∗(x) (□+ m2)φ∗(x). However,
in [54] a unique prescription is given to write every A ∈J ∩Floc in the form
(4.1.3). With this prescription one may write δA instead of δ⃗h· ⃗Q , as it is done in
[16, 17, 54]. Every A ∈J ∩Floc gives rise to a corresponding case of the MWI.

Formulation of the MWI
We transfer the classical MWI (4.1.5) to perturbative QFT by replacing each
Rcl

by R


i=1
hi(x) R

eS/ℏ
⊗, Qi(x)

·
δS0
δϕ(x) ∈J .
(4.2.1)
This is the quantum MWI to the interaction S and for the symmetry given by A or
⃗h · ⃗Q. The crucial diﬀerence to the classical MWI (4.1.5) is, that the factorization
(1.6.5) does not hold in QFT; therefore, the quantum MWI (4.2.1) does not follow
from the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation. Instead, as we will see, it is a renormalization
condition, which cannot always be satisﬁed. Its applications reach so far that one
may call it a universal formulation of symmetries [53, 54].
To simplify the notation, we shall almost always consider the case K = 1;
the generalization to 1 ≤K < ∞is obvious.

302
Chapter 4. Symmetries – the Master Ward Identity
The MWI can easily be translated into the time-ordered product: We insert
Bogoliubov’s formula (3.3.30)
R


= T(e−iS/ℏ

) ⋆T (eiS/ℏ

(where again T(e−iG

) := T (eiG

(F ⋆G) · δS0
δϕ = F ⋆

G · δS0
δϕ

∀F, G ∈F .
(4.2.2)
The latter relies on the fact that on the r.h.s. a contraction of F with δS0
δϕ vanishes,
since the propagator Δ+
m of the star product (2.1.5) is a solution of the free ﬁeld
equation, see (2.1.11). Proceeding this way, we obtain

4.2.2
Veriﬁcation that the MWI is a renormalization condition
To show that the MWI is indeed a renormalization condition, we work with the
time-ordered product. This is somewhat simpler than the corresponding argumen-
tation in terms of the retarded product.
We recall from Sect. 3.3: The time-ordered product T ≡(Tn)n∈N can be
constructed directly from its axioms by induction on n. In the inductive step (n −
1) →n the basic axioms determine Tn

⊗n
i=1Ai(xi)

uniquely on D(Mn \ Δn), all
further axioms restrict only the renormalization, that is, the extension to D(Mn)
(which is non-unique) – therefore they are called “renormalization conditions”.

4.2.
The Master Ward Identity as a universal renormalization condition
303
Hence, to verify that an axiom (A) is a renormalization condition, one usually has
to show that the validity of (A) for all T -products of lower orders, i.e., (Tk)k<n,
implies the validity of (A) for Tn|D(Mn\Δn).
For the MWI this procedure has to be modiﬁed a bit, since (4.2.4) contains
T -products of diﬀerent orders: Our method is induction on the order in the in-
teraction (which is given in (4.2.4) by the ﬁelds (Fj)1≤j≤n). More in detail we
proceed as follows:
• In a ﬁrst step we construct the T -product T ≡(Tn)n∈N∗by induction on n,
such that all renormalization conditions except the MWI are fulﬁlled.
• In a second step we modify the so-obtained T -product such that it satisﬁes
also the MWI, that is, we perform a ﬁnite renormalization S −→S ◦Z for
a suitable Z lying in the St¨uckelberg–Petermann RG. Here we proceed by
induction on the order in the interaction, except for Sect. 4.5 where we use
induction on the order in ℏ.
Now, let S =

dx g(x) L(x), g ∈D(M), L ∈P be the interaction. With that, the
MWI (4.2.4) to nth order in g can be written as

is well deﬁned, it is equal to

· ∂aδ(y −x).
Proceeding by induction on the order in g, we assume that the T -products
to lower orders are renormalized such that the MWI holds to all lower orders in g.
We are going to show that this implies that (4.2.5) is fulﬁlled on D(Mn+1 \Δn+1).
Namely, for (x1, . . . , xn, y) /∈Δn+1 there exists a K ⊂{1, . . . , n} with Kc :=
({1, . . ., n}\K) ̸= ∅such that either ({xk | k ∈Kc}+V +)∩({xj | j ∈K}∪{y}) = ∅
or ({xk | k ∈Kc} + V −) ∩({xj | j ∈K} ∪{y}) = ∅. We treat the ﬁrst case, the
second case is completely analogous. Using causal factorization of the time-ordered

due to the validity of the MWI (4.2.5) to order |K|(< n). By means of (4.2.2) and
causal factorization, the last expression agrees with the right-hand side of (4.2.5).
This proves that the MWI is indeed a renormalization condition.
The crucial and diﬃcult question is, whether there exists a renormalization
(i.e., an extension to the thin diagonal) of these time-ordered products, which
is compatible with all other renormalization conditions and which fulﬁlls (4.2.5).
Before studying this question, we give some applications of the MWI.
4.2.3
A few applications of the MWI
The physically most important application of the MWI is BRST symmetry [7, 8],
see [53, 54]. We treat here a few simpler examples.
Many applications of the MWI can be understood by means of Noether’s
Theorem for classical ﬁeld theory: If the total action (S0+S) of a model is invariant
under a certain transformation of the basic ﬁelds ϕj, there exists a corresponding
conserved Noether current jμ. The conservation of this current relies on the validity
of the ﬁeld equations, more precisely, there exist ﬁeld polynomials Qj ∈P such
that
∂μjμ(x) =

j
Qj(x) δ(S0 + S)
δϕj(x)
.
(4.2.9)
The classical current conservation ∂μjμ
S(x) = 0 (where Deﬁnition 1.6.1 is used)
can equivalently be written in the perturbative framework:
∂x

eS

C0 = 0 .

Example 4.2.1 (Scaling invariance expressed by conservation of the dilatation current).
The key to express scaling invariance in terms of the MWI is the sketched connection
(4.2.9)–(4.2.11) of Noether’s Theorem to the MWI. Since scaling invariance cannot be
maintained under quantization, we investigate clFT only.
We will work with the inﬁnitesimal version s : F −→F of the scaling transformation
σ−1
ρ
(Def. 3.1.20):
s F = ∂
∂ρ

ρ=1σ−1
ρ F ,
∀F ∈F .
Due to (3.1.49), s is a derivation; this holds also for the application to ﬁeld polynomials:
s(B1B2)(x) =

s B1(x)

· B2(x) + B1(x) · s B2(x) ,
∀B1, B2 ∈P .
(4.2.12)
For a homogeneous ﬁeld polynomial B(x), the relation (3.1.50) yields
s B(x) = (dim B + xν∂x
ν )B(x) ,
∀B ∈Phom .
(4.2.13)
From this formula and dim ∂μB = dim B + 1 for B ∈Phom we conclude that
s(∂μB(x)) = ∂μ
x (s B(x)) ,
∀B ∈Phom ;
(4.2.14)
actually, by linearity of s, this relation holds even for all B ∈P.
Let O be a double cone and g ∈G(O) (see (3.7.10)). We formally128 write the total
action as
S0 + S =

ddx Ltot(x) ,
Ltot(x) = L0(x) −κ g(x) Lint(x) ,
where g ∈D(M), and we assume that L0 and Lint contain zeroth and ﬁrst derivatives of
ϕ only.
We ﬁrst study the massless case m = 0. The crucial assumption is that L0, Lint ∈
Pd (see Def. 3.1.18), where d is the dimension of the Minkowski space. Setting gρ(x) =
g(ρx) and writing Sg for S, we formally obtain scaling invariance of the total action (up
to scaling of the switching function g)
σ−1
ρ (S0 + Sgρ) =

ddx ρd 
L0(ρx) −κ g(ρx)Lint(ρx)
	
= S0 + Sg .
A rigorous derivation and formulation of scaling invariance can be given by
s Ltot(x) = (d + xν∂x
ν )Ltot(x) = ∂νIν(x)
with
Iν(x) := xν Ltot(x) ,
∀x ∈O .
(4.2.15)
To derive the corresponding Noether current – the “dilatation current”, we compute
s Ltot(x) in a diﬀerent way by using the properties (4.2.12) and (4.2.14) of s:
s Ltot(x) = ∂Ltot
∂ϕ (x) sϕ(x) + ∂Ltot

Chapter 4. Symmetries – the Master Ward Identity
Since the term in [· · · ]-brackets is equal to δ(S0+S)
δϕ(x) , we indeed obtain the relation (4.2.9):
∂μjμ(x) = δ(S0 + S)
δϕ(x)
Q(x)
∀x ∈O ,
where
Q(x) := sϕ(x)
(4.2.17)
is the inﬁnitesimal transformation of the basic ﬁeld, and with the dilatation current
jμ(x) := Iμ(x) −∂Ltot
∂(∂μϕ)(x) sϕ(x) .
(4.2.18)
The derivation δhQ (introduced in (4.1.4)) agrees with s in the following sense: If we
choose h(x) = 1 ∀x ∈O we have
δhQF =

dx sϕ(x)
δF
δϕ(x) = s F
∀F ∈F(O) .
(4.2.19)
As explained in (4.2.10)–(4.2.11), the conservation of the dilatation current for x ∈O
can be understood as the restriction to C0 of the MWI:

δS0
δϕ(x) ,
∀h ∈D(O) ;
the restriction to h ∈D(O) is necessary since scaling invariance (4.2.15) holds true only
for x ∈O. The procedure (4.2.15)–(4.2.18) is a standard method to derive Noether’s
Theorem in clFT, it is of general applicability (see Exaps. 4.2.2 and 4.2.3), in particular
it works for BRST symmetry (see, e.g., [56, Sect. 3]).
Turning to the massive case m ≥0, we admit that L0 and Lint are of the form
Bm :=
d

l=0
md−l Bl
with
Bl ∈Pl .
Due to
σ−1
ρ Bρm(x) = ρd Bm(ρx) ,
(4.2.20)
the total action (Sm
0 + Sm
g ) is then invariant under the scaling (x, m) →(ρx, ρ−1m), up
to scaling of g. Formally, with gρ(x) := g(ρx),

From (4.2.20) we get
(m∂m + s)Bm(x) = ∂


ρ=1σ−1
ρ Bρm(x) = (d + xν∂x

Hence, the rigorous derivation and formulation of scaling invariance of the total action
given in (4.2.15), can be generalized to the massive case by
(m∂m+s) Lm
tot(x) =

tot(x) = ∂νIm

with

Formula (4.2.16) holds true also for the computation of s Lm
tot(x); hence, for x ∈O,
we get

The Master Ward Identity as a universal renormalization condition

By using the deﬁnition of the dilatation current (4.2.18), we ﬁnd the relation
∂μjm
μ (x) −m∂m Lm
tot(x) = δ(S0 + S)
δϕ(x)
Q(x)
∀x ∈O ,
with
Q(x) := sϕ(x) . (4.2.23)
Therefore, conservation of the dilatation current is broken in a well-controlled way; which
can be expressed by the MWI

A prime example is Lint(x) = ϕ4(x) in d = 4 dimensions. By using the expression

also to the massless case m = 0.
Example 4.2.2 (Scalar model with global O(N)-symmetry). [16] We consider a multiplet
of N real scalar ﬁelds ϕ(x) ≡

ϕi(x)
N
i=1 : C∞(M, RN) −→RN , transforming under the
deﬁning (or “fundamental”) representation of O(N) – the group of orthogonal N × N
matrices:
ϕi(x) −→Mijϕj(x) ,
M ∈O(N).129
(4.2.25)
Since M does not depend on x, one calls this a “global” transformation. Let {Xa | a =
1, . . . , 1
2N(N −1)} be a basis of the Lie algebra o(N) of O(N) and f abc the corresponding
structure constants,
[Xa, Xb] = f abcXc
∀a, b, c .
(4.2.26)
The main deﬁning property of o(N) is the skew-symmetry

(4.2.27)
The relevant space F of ﬁelds is the set of all functionals

satisﬁes the further properties listed in Deﬁnition 1.2.1; and Floc is deﬁned analogously
to Deﬁnition 1.3.4, the only diﬀerence is that P is now the space of polynomials in ∂aϕi
where a ∈Nd and i ∈{1, . . . , N}. The ﬁeld transformation (4.2.25) induces the following

which is invariant under the transformation (4.2.25). For each sa there is a corresponding
Noether current ja
μ, which can be computed by formula (4.2.18): Since saL0(x) = 0 ∀x ∈
M we have Iμ = 0 in that formula and, hence,

(2.6.2). The corresponding derivations (4.1.4) read
δhQa =

dx h(x) Xa

δ
δϕi(x) .
(4.2.31)
The relation (4.2.19) holds true also here: δhQaF = saF , if h(x) = 1 ∀x ∈supp F.
Now let S ∈Floc be an interaction of the form
S = −κ

dx g(x) Lint(x) ,
Lint(x) :=

with
g ∈D(M) , n ∈N∗.
By using (4.2.27) we verify that
δhQaLint(x) = 0 ,
∀x ∈M , ∀a , ∀h ∈D(M) ;
hence δhQaS = 0 ∀h, ∀a and saLint(x) = 0 ∀x, ∀a.

4.2.
The Master Ward Identity as a universal renormalization condition
309
Applying the derivation of the Noether current (4.2.15)–(4.2.18) to the interacting
model Ltot(x) = L0(x) −κ g(x)Lint(x) studied here, we ﬁnd the simpliﬁcations that
saLtot(x) = 0 ∀x ∈M and
∂Ltot
∂(∂μϕi) =
∂L0
∂(∂μϕi). Therefore, the Noether currents (ja
μ)S(x)
of the interacting model are given by the same formula (4.2.29) as for the free model, and
in clFT they are conserved modulo the ﬁeld equations for all x ∈M, that is, also in the
region where ∂g(x) ̸= 0. This result can very easily be obtained in an alternative way, by
arguing with the classical MWI: Namely, using (4.2.30) and δhQaS = 0 the latter says

is satisﬁed for all h ∈D(M) and all a. When referring to this MWI, we speak of one
(Master) Ward Identity, although these are actually 1
2N(N−1) identities – one for each a.
Example 4.2.3 (Non-Abelian matter currents). [53] 130 This application starts also with
a conserved current of the free theory, but the corresponding interacting current is not
conserved, even in clFT, due to δhQS ̸= 0. We work in d = 4 dimensions. To describe
Dirac spinors, we use the formalism introduced in Sect. 5.1.1; in particular, complex
conjugation is denoted by zc instead of z, according to Footn. 144.
We consider N Dirac spinor ﬁelds (ψα)N
α=1 and the currents131
jμ
a := ψα ∧γμ (λa)αβ
2
ψβ
(4.2.33)
(we use matrix notation for the spinor structure), where −iλa/2 ∈CN×N, a = 1, . . . ,
N 2 −1, is a basis of the Lie algebra su(N). That is, the λ-matrices satisfy the relations
[λa, λb] = 2ifabcλc ,
λ c
a
T = λa
and
tr λa = 0
∀a, b ,
(4.2.34)
where (fabc) are the structure constants belonging to this basis; they are totally anti-
symmetric. The conventions are such that we may choose the generalized Gell-Mann
matrices for the (λa). Under an SU(n)-transformation, the Dirac ﬁelds transform with
the fundamental representation and the gauge ﬁelds A ≡(Aμ
a) (deﬁned in Exer. 1.5.2,
see also Sect. 5.1.3) with the adjoint representation; we denote these representations by
ρ1 and ρ2, respectively. That is, the inﬁnitesimal transformations read:
(sbψ)α ≡ρ1(λb) ψα = −i
2 (λb)αβ ψβ ,
(sbψ)α ≡ρ1(λb) ψα = i
2 ψβ (λb)βα ,

gauge ﬁelds and the anticommuting Faddeev–Popov ghost ﬁelds ua, ˜ua (introduced in
Sect. 5.1.2); the precise form of L0 and L1 is irrelevant in the following, we only require
sb L0(A, u, ˜u) = 0 and sb L1(A, u, ˜u) = 0 for all b. QED (for N = 1) and QCD (for
N = 3) ﬁt in this framework: The quark ﬁelds ψα are in the fundamental representation
of SU(3).

Qa α := Q†
a α γ0 = −(saψ)α
(4.2.39)
with Q† being the adjoint matrix in spinor space of Q. That is, the currents jμ
a are
conserved modulo the free ﬁeld equations.
We point out that jμ
a (4.2.33) is the Noether current of the free model w.r.t. the
inﬁnitesimal ﬁeld transformation (−sψ,ψ
a

the expression for jμ
a (4.2.33) can be obtained from the formula for the Noether current
(4.2.18).
In view of the MWI, we introduce the functionals133

accordance with (4.2.19).

δψ is the functional derivative acting from the right-hand side, deﬁned in (5.1.33).

This result agrees with what is postulated in [109]. It holds true, if the relevant cases
of the MWI (i.e., (4.2.42) and (4.2.48)) are fulﬁlled by suitable renormalization of the
time-ordered products.

Chapter 4. Symmetries – the Master Ward Identity
Remark 4.2.7. It is a peculiarity of the examples treated in this section that the
symmetry Q is of zeroth order in the coupling constant κ and, hence, δhQ ∼κ0.
However, in general Q may be a formal power series in κ: Q = ∞
n=0 κnQn ; with
this we have
δhQ =
∞

n=0
κn δhQn ,
where
δhQn :=
	
dy h(y) Qn(y)
δ
δϕ(y) .
An important application of the MWI for which higher orders of κ appear in δhQ is
BRST symmetry [54, Sect. 5]. There, δhQ is a localized version of the usual BRST
transformation s, which is, e.g., for QED (see Sect. 5.5.2) and for Yang–Mills ﬁelds
of the form s = s0 + κs1.
4.3
Anomalous Master Ward Identity
(Quantum Action Principle)
In Sects. 4.3–4.5 we follow [16, 17].
Let be given an interaction S ∈Floc and a symmetry, i.e., a Q ∈P. To
fulﬁll the pertinent MWI one usually proceeds as follows: One starts with a re-
normalization of the retarded or time-ordered product, which fulﬁlls all other
renormalization conditions. Then the MWI for this Q is in general violated. The
theorem given in this section describes the structure of the violating term (also
called “anomalous term”). By using this information, one then seeks a ﬁnite re-
normalization which maintains all other renormalization conditions – i.e., a map
Z ∈R in the language of the Main Theorem (Thm. 3.6.3)134 – and which removes
the violating term.
Theorem 4.3.1 (Anomalous Master Ward Identity or “Quantum Action Princi-
ple”).
Part (a): Let (Rn,1)n∈N be a retarded product satisfying the basic axioms, Trans-
lation covariance and Field independence. Then there exists a unique sequence of
linear maps Δ ≡(Δn)n∈N (called “anomaly map”),

• The Scaling degree property (3.2.62) – which follows from axiom (k) or, alter-

Δ(eS
⊗; h 1) = 0 ,
∀S ∈Floc , h ∈D(M) .
(4.3.7)
A further useful property of the anomaly map Δ coming from the Oﬀ-shell
ﬁeld equation is worked out in Exer. 4.3.3.
Note that the anomalous MWI (4.3.3) diﬀers from the MWI (4.2.1) only by the
local term Δ(eS
⊗; hQ), which clearly depends on the chosen renormalization for the
retarded product. Therefore, the equality Δ(eS
⊗; hQ) = 0 is a suﬃcient condition
for the validity of the MWI for Q and S; it is also necessary due to the uniqueness
of the maps Δn.
The main message of this theorem is that the anomalous term is a local inter-
acting ﬁeld, namely R

eS/ℏ
⊗, Δ(eS
⊗; hQ)

is the interacting ﬁeld to the interaction
S and corresponding to the local functional Δ(eS
⊗; hQ).
This theorem plays an important role in the proof of BRST symmetry for
quantum Yang–Mills ﬁelds in curved spacetime given by S. Hollands [105], and
in the analysis of the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism in the framework of causal
perturbation theory given by K. Fredenhagen and K. Rejzner [74].
The name “Quantum Action Principle (QAP)” refers to the famous Quan-
tum Action Principle of Lowenstein [125] and Lam [119]; Theorem 4.3.1 is the
corresponding statement in the framework of causal perturbation theory.
The anomalous MWI (4.3.3) can equivalently be written in terms of time-
ordered products: Proceeding as in Sect. 4.2 we obtain

βa Δ(eS
⊗; hQ) = Δ(eβaS
⊗

4.3.

• The Field independence (4.3.5) implies that Δ(eS
⊗; hQ) satisﬁes the causal
Wick expansion (3.1.23).
• By using that the values of |a| appearing on the r.h.s. of (4.3.4) are bounded
by the r.h.s. of (4.3.6), we conclude that

(4.3.9)
In addition, we point out the similarity of properties (4.3.4) and (4.3.6)
of Δ to formulas (3.6.34) and (3.6.35) expressing the properties “Locality
and Translation covariance” and “Scaling degree” of an element Z of the
St¨uckelberg–Petermann group. At ﬁrst glance one might think that formula
(4.3.6) has an additional term: d+2
2 . However, since in the MWI there are
terms in which Q is accompanied by δS0
δϕ , we have to consider dim(Q δS0
δϕ ) =
dim(Q) + d+2
2
(instead of only dim(Q)) when comparing with (3.6.35).
Sketch of the proof. Ad (a):
The procedure is analogous to the proof of part (a)
of the Main Theorem (Thm. 3.6.3): Writing the implicit deﬁnition (4.3.8) of the
sequence (Δl)l∈N to an arbitrary, ﬁxed order in S (i.e., in g or in κ), we get a
recursion relation which yields a unique inductive construction of (Δl). In detail:

We immediately get Δ0 = 0. In order that this relation gives a unique inductive
construction of the sequence (Δl)l∈N, the sum of distributions on the right-hand
side of (4.3.11) must take values in Floc. Assuming that this holds true, the so-
obtained maps Δn : P⊗(n+1) −→D′(M, Floc) are obviously linear and permutation
invariant (4.3.2).
The main task is to prove that Δn(⊗n
j=1Lj; Q), deﬁned inductively by
(4.3.11), satisﬁes “Locality and Translation covariance” (4.3.4); the latter implies
that Δn(⊗n
j=1Lj; Q) takes values in Floc. The ﬁrst and main step of the proof of
(4.3.4) is to verify that136
supp Δn(⊗n
j=1Lj; Q) ⊆Δn+1 .
(4.3.12)
To prove this we proceed analogously to (4.2.7)–(4.2.8): We show inductively that
Δn
⊗n
j=1Lj(xj); Q(y)

= 0 if there exists a K ⊂{1, . . . , n} with Kc ̸= ∅and
({xk | k ∈Kc} + V +) ∩({xj | j ∈K} ∪{y}) = ∅. (Again, the case “y lies in the
later set” is completely analogous.) If Δl vanishes to lower orders l < n, this
veriﬁcation is given by (4.2.7)–(4.2.8). To include the lower orders Δ|I|-terms, we
use that, for the considered conﬁguration, the range of the sum in the last term
of (4.3.11) is reduced to I ⊆K, since supp Δ|I|(. . .) ⊆Δ|I|+1 by the inductive
assumption. Due to that, the causal factorization of this last term reads

Now, in (4.2.7) and (4.2.8) we throughout replace L(xj) by Lj(xj). With that
and by using causal factorization, the sum of the second, third and fourth term
136Mind the diﬀerence: Δn with an upper index n denotes the nth anomaly map (4.3.1); but by
Δk with a lower index k we mean the thin diagonal in Mk (A.1.12). Note also that we mean the
support in the sense of distributions, that is, the support of Δn(· · · ) itself and not of δΔn(· · · )/δϕ
– Deﬁnition 1.3.3 does not apply here.

4.3.

on the r.h.s. of (4.3.11) is equal to minus (4.2.7) minus (4.3.13). By means of the
anomalous MWI (4.3.11) to order |K|, the latter sum is equal to minus (4.2.8).
Finally this last expression is equal to minus the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. of (4.3.11),
as explained after (4.2.8). Therefore, the r.h.s. of (4.3.11) vanishes on D(Mn+1 \
Δn+1) and, hence, this holds also for Δn

j=1Lj(xj); Q(y)

.
To show that (4.3.12) implies (4.3.4) we proceed as follows: Δn(⊗n
j=1Lj; Q)
is, according to its inductive deﬁnition (4.3.11), a distribution on D(Mn+1) which
takes values in F. Hence, according to Deﬁnition 1.2.1, it is of the form

k (⊗n
j=1Lj ⊗Q)(x1, . . . , xn, y, z1, . . . , zk) ∈D′(Mn+k+1) depends linearly
on
(⊗n
j=1Lj ⊗Q), is invariant under permutations of the pairs (L1, x1), . . . , (Ln, xn)
and is symmetric in z1, . . . , zk. Due to (4.3.12) the support of f n
k (⊗n
j=1Lj ⊗Q)
is contained in Δn+1 × Mk; but, to obtain the assertion (4.3.4), we have to show
that f n
k (⊗n
j=1Lj ⊗Q) is a linear combination of derivatives of δ(x1 −y, . . . , xn −y,
z1 −y, . . . , zk −y). For this purpose we take into account that the T -products on
the r.h.s. of (4.3.11) are translation covariant and satisfy Field independence and
that, by induction, these properties hold also for Δ|I| if |I| < n. We conclude that
f n
k (⊗n
j=1Lj ⊗Q) depends only on the relative coordinates and that

that

hence, f n
k (⊗n
j=1Lj ⊗Q) is indeed a linear combination of derivatives of δ(x1 −

The important property (iii) of Δn follows immediately from the validity of

Chapter 4. Symmetries – the Master Ward Identity
Field independence of Δn (property (iv)) can be proved inductively by means
of formula (4.3.11) and Field independence of the T -products; note that the two
terms with the derivative acting on
δ S0
δϕ(y) cancel out, since
δ2S0
δϕ(z)δϕ(y) = −(□+
m2) δ(z −y) is a C-number (i.e., does not contain ϕ) and, hence, it does not
matter whether
δ2S0
δϕ δϕ stands inside or outside of T (· · · ).
Ad (b):
The statement about the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation is trivial, because
this ﬁeld equation is precisely the MWI for Q = 1. Lorentz covariance and ∗-
structure of Δn follow from the inductive construction (4.3.11) (see Footn. 135).
The proof of the mass dimension bound (4.3.6) is nontrivial, we refer to [16, 17].
As a substitute we prove a corresponding statement for the massless theory – this
is done in Proposition 4.3.2 below.
□
In Theorem 4.3.1 we describe the scaling behaviour of Δn


only
by the relation (4.3.6), which yields the bound (4.3.9) on the scaling degree of

inhomogeneous polynomials: S(m)

≡S0 ̸∈Phom, δS(m)
0
δϕ
̸∈Phom and, hence, also
A(m) ≡A lies in general not in Phom. A relation expressing the scaling behaviour
of Δn
⊗n
j=1Lj; Q

can most probably be derived, if the mass m of the underlying
star product, which is also the mass appearing in S(m)
0
, is also scaled, and if the
retarded (or time-ordered) product fulﬁlls the Sm-expansion axiom; but such a
relation would be rather involved (cf. [16, Sect. 5.2]).
However, for m = 0 the values of the anomaly map, i.e., Δn(⊗n
j=1Lj; Q), scale
homogeneously, if suitable assumptions are made. This is essentially the message
of the following proposition.
Proposition 4.3.2 (Homogeneous scaling of the anomalous term for m = 0). Let
m = 0 and let Lj, Q ∈Phom (1 ≤j ≤n) be given. In addition, we assume that
the T -product (or R-product) fulﬁlls (besides the axioms needed for part (a) of
Thm. 4.3.1) the Sm-expansion axiom; for m = 0 the latter is simply the condition
of almost homogeneous scaling:

Proof. The idea of proof is that, in the inductive construction (4.3.11) of Δn,
almost homogeneous scaling of the T -products implies almost homogeneous scaling
of Δn. Then, taking into account the structure (4.3.4) of Δn, it follows that the
scaling of Δn is even homogeneous.

Finally we insert formula (4.3.4) into (4.3.18). Since we do not know yet that

We conclude that the exponent of ρ vanishes; hence, dim(P n

on k, that is, P n
a ∈Phom. In addition, the vanishing of this exponent yields the
restriction (4.3.15) on the sum over a, and it also implies that (4.3.19) holds true
already for N = 1. Consequently, the latter holds also for (4.3.18) – this is the
assertion (4.3.16).

Reduction of the MWI to the “quantum part”
Since the MWI holds true in classical ﬁeld theory, the quantum MWI is automati-
cally satisﬁed for tree diagrams; working in terms of the R-product, this statement
follows from Claim 3.1.28 (in Sect. 3.1.7), however, it holds also for the MWI in
terms of the T -product. Therefore, there is some redundancy if one formulates
the MWI in terms of the whole time-ordered product. In this section we show
that there is an equivalent reformulation of the (anomalous) MWI in terms of the
“quantum part” of the T -product. Mostly this simpliﬁes the search for a ﬁnite
renormalization Z ∈R which removes the anomalous term from the anomalous
MWI. And it is the so-obtained formulation of the anomalous MWI which corre-
sponds to the formulation of the QAP mostly used in algebraic renormalization,
see, e.g., [135].
4.4.1
Proper vertices
Proper vertices137 are an old and standard tool in pQFT. Usually they are de-
scribed in terms of the “vertex functional” Γ(h) (where h ∈S(M, R) is a ﬁeld
conﬁguration), which is deﬁned as the Legendre transform j →h of the genera-
ting functional Z(j) of the connected Green’s functions (where j is the “classical
source” of ϕ). This procedure is due to G. Jona-Lasinio [110], it can be found in
many textbooks, e.g., [135], [109, Sect. 6-2-2].
In the framework of causal perturbation theory, proper vertices (or the “pro-
per interaction”) have been introduced by proceeding more elementary [16, 17].
In terms of the R-product the basic idea is the following: An interacting quantum
ﬁeld can be rewritten as a classical ﬁeld with a non-local interaction (“proper
137In the literature proper vertices (or the “proper interaction”) are sometimes called “eﬀective
vertices” (or “eﬀective interaction” resp.). However, diﬀerently to what we are doing here, the
notion “eﬀective ﬁeld theory” usually means an approximation to the perturbation series. For
this reason we omit the word “eﬀective” and use the terminology of [109, Sect. 6-2-2].

324
Chapter 4. Symmetries – the Master Ward Identity
interaction”) and a non-local ﬁeld vertex (“proper ﬁeld vertex”), which agree to
lowest order in ℏwith the original local interaction and the original local ﬁeld
vertex, respectively. Hence, the proper interaction and the proper ﬁeld vertex can
be understood as the “quantum parts” of the interacting quantum ﬁeld. In terms of
the diagrammatic interpretation of the unrenormalized R-product, this rewriting
can be justiﬁed as follows: Since Rcl is the sum of all (connected) tree diagrams
(Claim 3.1.28), we interpret each diagram as tree diagram with non-local vertices
(“proper vertices”) given by the 1-particle-irreducible (1PI) subdiagrams.138
This structural decomposition of Feynman diagrams into [tree diagrams]
“times” [1PI-diagrams] can just as well be done for the unrenormalized T -product,
and it is this latter form of proper vertices which is well known in the traditional
literature. Since the T -product is totally symmetric, it is simpler to introduce
proper vertices in terms of the T -product than in terms of the R-product and,
hence, we work with the former. (For a study of proper vertices belonging to the
R-product we refer to [16, App.].)
A main motivation to introduce proper vertices is that the renormalization
of an arbitrary diagram reduces to the renormalization of its 1PI-subdiagrams,
because tree diagrams can be renormalized by the direct extension (3.2.22). Note
that also some 1PI diagrams can be renormalized by the direct extension – see
Exap. 3.2.10.
We are now going to formulate this diagrammatic intuition about proper
vertices in terms of algebraic deﬁnitions for the renormalized T -product. First
we eliminate all disconnected diagrams. This elimination is not necessary, proper
vertices can also be deﬁned in terms of the complete T -product – the two deﬁni-
tions agree, see [16]. However, working with the connected part T c of a T -product
(Deﬁnition 4.4.1), we can interpret the connected tree diagrams as the “classi-
cal limit” of T c (formula (4.4.5) below); hence, all quantum eﬀects are described
by diagrams containing at least one 1PI-subdiagram. In addition, proceeding this
way, it is much easier to verify that the proper interaction is of the form [original
local interaction] + [quantum corrections] (see Exer. 4.4.7 below).
The connected part of a T -product. The following Deﬁnition does not use any
diagrammatic interpretation of the T -product.
Deﬁnition 4.4.1. The connected part T c of a time-ordered product T can be deﬁned
recursively by

(4.4.1)
138The deﬁning criterion for a 1-particle-irreducible Feynman diagram is that it cannot be split
into two disconnected parts by cutting only one inner line. Feynman diagrams, which do not
satisfy this criterion are called “1-particle-reducible”. Trivial examples for 1-particle-reducible
diagrams are disconnected diagrams or connected tree diagrams. Every 1PI diagram is a loop
diagram; but, there are connected loop diagrams which are not 1PI, see Footn. 34.

where P is a partition of {1, . . ., n} into |P| subsets (which are labeled by J) and
0 means the classical product. For n = 0 we set T c
0(c) := 0 ∀c ∈C.
An immediate consequence of this deﬁnition is that T c
n : F⊗n
loc −→F satisﬁes
the axioms (i) (Linearity), (ii) (Initial condition, explicitly: T c
1(F) = F) and (iii)
(Symmetry) for a T -product. Due to linearity, we may use the notations (A.1.7)–

The time-ordered connected tree product. Proceeding analogously to Sect. 3.1.6

ℏ0, it holds that
T c

A1(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗An(xn)

(4.4.4)
In terms of diagrams one can argue as follows: For the unrenormalized T -product
(i.e., restricted to D( ˇMn)) each diagram contributing to the l.h.s. has at least

326
Chapter 4. Symmetries – the Master Ward Identity
(n −1) inner lines and each inner line has precisely one factor ℏ,139 and there are
no further ℏ. Hence, the unrenormalized time-ordered product fulﬁlls (4.4.4). Due
to the axiom (x) for the T -product, this relation is maintained in the process of
renormalization.
For the unrenormalized T c
n we additionally see that the term of lowest order
in ℏof (4.4.4), i.e., the limit
ℏ(n−1) lim
ℏ→0 ℏ−(n−1) T c
n

A1(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗An(xn)


D( ˇMn) ,
selects precisely the contribution of all connected tree diagrams, because the con-
nected tree diagrams are precisely the connected diagrams with (n−1) inner lines.
This is the motivation to deﬁne the “connected tree part” T c
tree,n of the renormal-
ized T -product Tn by
T c
tree,n := ℏ(n−1) lim
ℏ→0 ℏ−(n−1) T c
n : F⊗n
loc −→F .
(4.4.5)
Hence, T c
tree is the “classical part” of T c, and connected loop diagrams are of
higher orders in ℏ. Since the contributions of tree diagrams to A1(x1) ⋆ΔF
m · · · ⋆ΔF
m
An(xn) are given by pure tensor products of distributions (pointwise products of
distributions do not appear) and, hence, are well deﬁned on D(Mn), we may write

(4.4.6)
in D′(Mn), that is, T c
tree,n may be computed by the Feynman rules.
We point out that the deﬁnition (4.4.5) works only for local entries. But, since
in general proper vertices are non-local, we need the “time-ordered connected tree
product”, which is the generalization of the connected tree part (4.4.5) to non-local
entries and is also denoted by T c
tree,n. The deﬁnition of T c
tree,n : F⊗n −→F can be
given by means of formula (4.4.6):

m · · · ⋆ΔF

∀F1, . . . , Fn ∈F .
(4.4.7)
To give a more explicit, analytic deﬁnition we proceed recursively: For an arbi-
trary connected tree diagrams of order (n + 1) with (possibly non-local) vertices
F1, . . . , Fn, Fn+1, the additional vertex Fn+1 is connected to the other vertices
as shown in Figure 4.1. This ﬁgure has to be understood with the speciﬁcations
k ∈{1, . . ., n}, Ij ̸= ∅∀j and I1 ⊔· · · ⊔Ik = {1, . . ., n}, where ⊔means the
disjoint union; moreover we use the notation FI := ⊗j∈IFj. This diagrammatic
consideration yields the following deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition 4.4.4. The time-ordered connected tree product T c
tree = (T c
tree,n)n∈N,
where T c
tree,n : F⊗n −→F, is deﬁned recursively by T c
tree,0(c) := 0 ∀c ∈C ,
139The latter is due to the factor ℏaccompanying each propagator Hm in the deﬁnition of the
star product (Deﬁnition 2.1.1, (2.1.5)).

From (4.4.8) we inductively see that T c
tree,n+1 ∼ℏn – in agreement with
(4.4.5). For local entries, F1, . . . , Fn ∈Floc, the two deﬁnitions (4.4.5) and (4.4.8)
of T c
tree,n(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn) indeed agree, since both deﬁnitions are equivalent to
(4.4.7).

linear; in addition, T c
tree,n is also totally symmetric – this follows from (4.4.7), since

Proper vertices. We describe proper vertices in terms of the “vertex functional”

(4.4.12)
Before giving the proof we comment on this deﬁnition of Γ.
• Given Γ, T c is uniquely determined by (4.4.12) and, due to the linked cluster
theorem (4.4.2), this holds also for T .
• The basic relation
Γ(S) = S
(4.4.13)
is obtained from (4.4.12) by selecting the terms of ﬁrst order in S and by
using Γ(eλS
⊗) = λ Γ(S) + O(λ2).
• The unrenormalized vertex functional, i.e., Γ

⊗n

D( ˇMn) with L ∈P,
can be interpreted as “proper vertex of order n”, that is, as the sum of all

Γ(⊗j∈JL(xj))

the latter are proper vertices of order |J|(< n); this is known by induction.
Therefore, the term given by the sum over |P| ≥2 can be interpreted as
the sum of all 1-particle-reducible diagrams (see Footn. 138) contributing

140We recall from (A.1.10) that Γ is uniquely determined on the whole domain T(Floc) by its
values on the subset { eS

 S ∈Floc }, since Γ is required to be totally symmetric and linear.

• Relation to the Main Theorem (Thm. 3.6.3): Writing any element Z of the

linear and symmetric map D : T(Floc) −→Floc the Main Theorem formula,
T c(eiS/ℏ

) = T c(e
iD(eS
⊗)/ℏ
⊗
) (4.4.3), is of a similar form as the deﬁnition of Γ
(4.4.12); a main diﬀerence is that the values of Γ are in general non-local.
Proof. We prove the proposition by constructing Γ(⊗n
j=1Fj) by induction on n.
We start with Γ(1) = 0 and Γ(S) = S. The inductive step is uniquely given by
the deﬁning relation (4.4.12): By using total symmetry and linearity of T c, T c
tree
and Γ, this relation yields

(4.4.16)
similarly to (4.4.14); again P has the same meaning as in (4.4.1). Obviously, the
so-constructed Γ is totally symmetric and linear. So the procedure is analogous to
the inductive construction of the map Z ≡(Z(n)) in the proof of part (a) of the
Main Theorem.

4.4.
Reduction of the MWI to the “quantum part”
331
The relation Γ(eS
⊗) = S + O(ℏ) may be read as Γ(eS
⊗) = S+ [quantum cor-
rections]. Motivated by this, Γ

eS
⊗

is also called the “proper interaction (corres-
ponding to the classical interaction S)”.
The validity of renormalization conditions for the time-ordered product T ≡
T (m) is equivalent to corresponding properties of Γ (see [16, Lemma 6]). As an
example we discuss almost homogeneous scaling, which is a consequence of the
Sm-expansion axiom (cf. (3.1.67)): If
σρ ◦T (ρ−1m)
n

(σ−1
ρ F)⊗n
= T (m)
n
(F ⊗n) + O(log ρ) is a polynomial in log ρ
(4.4.18)
for all F ∈Floc , n ∈N, we see from the deﬁnition (4.4.1) that T c ≡T c (m) scales
also almost homogeneously, i.e., satisﬁes also (4.4.18). Moreover, T c (m)
tree
scales even
homogeneously,
σρ ◦T c (ρ−1m)
tree

e
σ−1
ρ
F

eF


∀F ∈F ;
this follows inductively from the deﬁnition (4.4.8) since ρd−2 ΔF
m/ρ(ρx) = ΔF
m(x).
Using these results, we inductively conclude from (4.4.16) that Γ ≡Γ(m) scales
also almost homogeneously:
σρ ◦Γ(ρ−1m)
(σ−1
ρ S)⊗n
= Γ(m)(S⊗n) + O(log ρ) is a polynomial in log ρ
(4.4.19)
for all S ∈Floc , n ∈N∗. The argumentation can easily be reversed, to show that
(4.4.19) is also suﬃcient for (4.4.18).
If the Sm-expansion axiom is replaced by the (weaker) axiom Scaling degree
(3.2.62), the corresponding property of Γ reads:

The Master Ward Identity in terms of proper vertices
Since, as we will show, the MWI holds for connected tree diagrams with non-local
vertices, the anomalous MWI can equivalently be reformulated in terms of proper
vertices. We do this in several steps.
Proof of the MWI for connected tree diagrams. Since T c
tree is the classical part
of the time-ordered product, we can proceed analogously to the derivation of the
classical MWI (in Sect. 4.1). An essential new feature is that non-local functionals,
S ∈F and A =

dx h(x)Q(x) δS0
δϕ(x) ∈J (with h ∈D(M)), may appear as entries
of T c
tree; in case of A this means that Q(h) ≡

dx h(x)Q(x) ∈F needs not to lie
in Floc. As above, let δhQ :=

MWI in Thm. 4.3.1 (given in (4.3.3) or (4.3.8), respectively) can equivalently be
expressed in terms of proper vertices:

Also the original version of the Quantum Action Principle of Lowenstein [125]
and Lam [119] is formulated in terms of proper vertices.
In the last step of the derivation of (4.4.33) we use the following auxiliary

Removing violations of the Master Ward Identity
We continue to follow [16].
A crucial and diﬃcult problem in perturbative renormalization reads: How
can we fulﬁll the MWI for a given interaction S and a given symmetry (i.e., a
given Q ∈P) to all orders?
We recall from Sect. 4.3 that a widespread strategy is to start with an
arbitrary renormalization prescription fulﬁlling all other renormalization condi-
tions; with that the considered MWI is in general broken, that is, the MWI
contains an anomalous term R


⊗, Δ

eS


. One then searches for a ﬁ-
nite renormalization which removes the anomalous term. There are symmetries Q
and interactions S for which this cannot be completely done. The non-removable
R


eS

are the famous anomalies of perturbative QFT, e.g., the
scaling anomaly (cf. Sect. 3.2.7) or the axial anomaly in axial QED (see formula
(5.2.30)).
4.5.1
Proceeding analogously to algebraic renormalization
The formal equivalence of the anomalous MWI in terms of proper vertices (given
in Proposition 4.4.13) and the QAP makes it possible to apply basic techniques of
algebraic renormalization (see, e.g., [135]) within the framework of causal pertur-
bation theory. Algebraic renormalization proceeds by induction on the power of
ℏ. The question whether one can ﬁnd a ﬁnite renormalization which removes the
possible anomaly (i.e., the local interacting ﬁeld violating the Ward identity) then
amounts – by means of the QAP – to purely algebraic problems, often cohomo-
logical properties of the underlying symmetry group (see, e.g., [5, 96] for detailed
studies of the BRST cohomology).
General procedure. We will apply this strategy to the MWI in terms of proper
vertices (which is given by (4.4.33) with Δ

eS
⊗; Q(x)

:= 0). A main diﬀerence
between our MWI-formalism and algebraic renormalization is that we work with
compactly supported interactions
S = κ L(g) ≡κ
	
dx g(x) L(x) ,
g ∈D(M) , L ∈P ,

and localized symmetry transformations δhQ. To bring our formalism into line
with algebraic renormalization with respect to the latter point, we will replace
h ∈D(M) by the constant function h(x) = 1 ∀x ∈M at a certain stage – see
(4.5.15).
We will work with the axiom Scaling degree instead of the Sm-expansion.
Given Q, L ∈P – the switching function g in (4.5.1) is arbitrary, we are going to
investigate whether possible anomalies of the corresponding MWI can be removed
by ﬁnite renormalizations of Γ (4.4.23). Proceeding by induction on the power of ℏ,
we assume that for a given vertex functional Γk (which satisﬁes the renormalization
conditions Field independence, Poincar´e covariance, ∗-structure, Field parity, Oﬀ-
shell ﬁeld Equation, ℏ-dependence and Scaling degree) the MWI is violated only
by terms of order ℏl with l ≥k. This means that in the anomalous MWI for Γk,

vertex functional Γ fulﬁlls this assumption (4.5.2)–(4.5.3) for k = 1 and, hence,
can be used as Γ1.
To fulﬁll the MWI to kth order in ℏand to maintain the other renormali-
zation conditions, we have to ﬁnd an element Zk of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann
renormalization group R0 (we mean the version of this group belonging to the
above-mentioned renormalization conditions, see Remk. 3.6.6) such that

the pertinent ﬁnite renormalization Zk ∈R0 removes the “anomaly” Δk

to order ℏk. However, since Z>
k appears in (4.5.11) several times and in diﬀerent
forms, it seems almost impossible to discuss the existence of solutions in general.
Simplifying assumptions. To simplify the search for a Z>
k solving (4.5.11), we make
the following assumptions:
• Symmetry Q ∈P: We assume that
Q(x) δS0
δϕ(x) = ∂μjμ(x) for some jμ ∈P which is bilinear in the basic ﬁelds.
(4.5.12)
Consequently, Q is linear in the basic ﬁelds, that is, Q(x) = 
a Ca∂aϕ(x)
(with Ca ∈C) for the model of one real scalar ﬁeld. Usually, this assumption
is satisﬁed in the following way: Q(x) is the inﬁnitesimal version of a linear
transformation of a basic ﬁeld under which S0 is invariant and jμ is the
corresponding conserved Noether current , see (4.2.17) – Exaps. 4.2.1, 4.2.2
and 4.2.3 and Exer. 4.2.6 are of this type.
• Interaction S ∈Floc: We assume
Q(x)
δS
δϕ(x) = 0
∀x .
(4.5.13)
In contrast to Exap. 4.2.2, this assumption is not fulﬁlled in Exaps. 4.2.1
and 4.2.3.
With these assumptions the condition (4.5.11) on Z>
k simpliﬁes to

From (4.5.10) we see that these two relations follow from the deﬁning proper-
ties Field equation (Property (7) in Deﬁnition 3.6.1) and AWI (formula (3.6.7)),
respectively, of the elements of the relevant S¨uckelberg–Petermann group R0.
To bring the condition (4.5.14) more into line with algebraic renormalization,
we integrate it over x. The integrals

and
δQ Z>
k (S) :=

and
δZ>

Chapter 4. Symmetries – the Master Ward Identity
these two equations are due to the Locality of Δk (4.3.4) and the Field indepen-
dence of Zk (Property (4) in Deﬁnition 3.6.1). From (4.5.10) and the Locality of
Zk (3.6.34) we see that

x ̸∈supp S ;
hence,

where
S = κ L(g) ,
(4.5.15)
which is a necessary condition for Z>

To ﬁrst order in S (i.e., in κ) Z>
k (S) vanishes. Therefore, the condition
(4.5.15) can only be satisﬁed if141

relevant renormalization conditions and removes the term ∼ℏk of Δ1

we refer to [16, Sect. 5.4.1]. (The explicit proof given there does not need the
assumptions (4.5.12)–(4.5.13), it shows that the MWI can generally be fulﬁlled to
ﬁrst order in S – for all Q and for all S.)
Such a ﬁnite renormalization of T2 modiﬁes also the T -product to higher
orders and Δn
k(S⊗n; Q(x)) for n ≥2. However, since this ﬁnite renormalization is
the addition of local terms of order O(ℏk), the relation Δk

eS
⊗; Q(x)

= O(ℏk) is
preserved.
A main problem is that (4.5.15) is not suﬃcient for (4.5.14). To discuss this,
let us assume that we have found a
δZ>
k (κ L(g))
δϕ
∼ℏk solving (4.5.15) for the
particular pair (L, Q) given from the outset and for all g ∈D(M), and which is
compatible with the requirement Zk ∈R0. We point out that the map Z>
k is not
completely determined by that; uniquely ﬁxed are only δQ Z>

and, due
to Zk ∈R0, some structural properties of δZ>

, how can we construct
a solution Zk of (4.5.14) which has also the other required properties? To answer
this question we use the following lemma – results of this kind are frequently used
to solve problems of this type, cf. Sect. 5.2.2.

(4.5.18)
It is remarkable that the Floc-valued distribution in the [· · · ]-brackets is again
supported on the thin diagonal, since (∂a)δ-distributions can be generated by
computing the divergence ∂y
μtμ(y, . . .) of a non-local tμ(y, . . .). To give an example
for that, let P ∈P arbitrary and
f(y, x) := ∂νδ(x −y) P(y) −δ(x −y) ∂νP(y) = −∂ν
y
#
δ(x −y) P(y)
$
= (∂νδ)(x −y) P(x) .
(4.5.19)
Although f(x, y) satisﬁes the assumptions of the lemma, it can also be written as
f(x, y) = ∂y
μtμ(x, y)
with
tμ(x, y) := (∂μ∂νDret)(x −y) P(x) .
In [16, Lemma 14] Lemma 4.5.1 is used but not proved, we close this gap
here.
Proof. Let (Bj)j∈N be a basis of Pbal. Due to Proposition 1.4.3(a) any Pa ∈P can
uniquely be written as
Pa(ϕ) =

j,b
cajb ∂bBj(ϕ)
with coeﬃcients
cajb ∈C ,
where b ∈Nd. By using this result, we write

∂bBj(ϕ)(y) pjb(∂x1, . . . , ∂xn)δ(x1 −y, . . . , xn −y) ,

where pjb(∂x1, . . . , ∂xn) is a polynomial in the dn variables (∂μ
xk)μ=0,...,d−1
k=1,...,n
. In order
that the Fourier transformation is well deﬁned, we apply the functional f(y, x1, . . .)

the particular pair (L, Q) given from the outset, and also the deﬁnition (4.5.24) is
made only for this particular pair.
The crucial question is whether this deﬁnition is compatible with the require-
ment that Zk is an element of the relevant St¨uckelberg–Petermann group R0. From
(4.5.22) we know that (4.5.24) satisﬁes the “Locality” property (3.6.34). The pro-
perties “Poincar´e covariance”, “∗-structure”, “Field parity” and “ℏ-dependence”

The problem with the deﬁnition (4.5.24) comes from the condition that Z(n)
k
must satisfy the Field independence, that is, the causal Wick expansion (3.6.9).
To discuss this, we split the polynomials L and j into monomials: L =

j = 
s js. By the causal Wick expansion, Z(n)

(4.5.25)
respectively. To fulﬁll the Field equation property, we set z(n)
k (. . . , ∂aϕ, . . .) := 0
for all a ∈Nd. With that, true submonomials of js need not to be considered (since
we assume that js is bilinear in ϕ), and only Lrk which are at least bilinear in ϕ
are relevant. If js ⊆Lr for some s and r, the deﬁnition (4.5.24) is plagued with
the following problems:
• Since z(n)
k

Lr1, . . . , Lrn−1, js

appears in the causal Wick expansion of both,
Z(n)
k
(⊗n−1
l=1 Lrl ⊗Lr) and Z(n)
k
(⊗n−1
l=1 Lrl ⊗js), these two cannot be deﬁned
independently.
• Among the z(n)


there appear distributions z(n)
k

Lr1, . . . , Lrt, js, . . . , js

with 0 ≤t ≤n −2.
The latter must be symmetrical in the (n −t) entries js. However, in general
there is no hint that Kn μ
L,Q has a corresponding symmetry.
For the relevant MWI of QED (called “QED-MWI”, see Sect. 5.2), L and j are
monomials and it holds that j ⊂L, that is, the just mentioned problems appear.
Although the proof of the QED-MWI given in Sect. 5.2.2 uses a diﬀerent method
– it proceeds by induction on the order in S – essentially the same problems
reappear; they are solved by a case by case study.
For the scalar O(N)-model, introduced in Exap. 4.2.2, we have js ̸⊆L =

i(ϕi)2n ∀s; hence, the method applies. This holds also for Exer. 4.2.6, if we
choose Pj := L (for all 1 ≤j ≤n) with θL = 0 in order to fulﬁll the assumption
(4.5.13).
If these problems do not appear or can be solved, one ﬁnally veriﬁes that
the VEVs z(n)
k

Lr1, . . . , Lrn−1, js

(4.5.25) satisfy the property “Scaling degree”
(3.6.31). This can be done straightforwardly by means of the deﬁnition of
Z(n)
k
(L⊗(n−1) ⊗j) (4.5.23)–(4.5.24), using also the causal Wick expansion of
Δn

and the upper bounds (4.3.9) and (3.6.31), respec-
tively, for the scaling degree of the coeﬃcients appearing in these two expansions.

4.5.2
Proof of the relevant MWI for the scalar O(N)-model
We follow [16, Sect. 5.4.4].
We return to the scalar O(N)-model treated in Exap. 4.2.2. Since the group
O(N) is compact, the MWI (4.2.32) can be maintained in the process of renor-
malization (i.e., the extension to the thin diagonal) by integration over the group
O(N), as explained in (3.2.91). To illustrate the developed formalism we proceed
alternatively.
Let
S = κ L(g) ,
L :=

and g ∈D(M) arbitrary,
the
1
2N(N −1) symmetries under investigation are given by Qa(x) = Xaϕ(x)
(4.2.30). We recall that the assumptions (4.5.12)–(4.5.13) are satisﬁed:
Qa(x) δS0
δϕ(x) = ∂μja
μ(x)
and
Qa(x)
δS
δϕ(x) = 0

Following the method of proof given in the preceding section, the anomalous MWI
for Γk (4.5.2), which determines Δk

Having found such a Z>

k


(4.5.24) is
unproblematic, as explained above; the resulting Z>
k solves (4.5.14).
To solve (4.5.27) we temporarily restrict the functionals (1.2.1) to the space
D(M, R). This permits us to integrate (4.5.26) over x ∈M without meeting any
infrared divergences, ending up with the equation
δaΓk(eS
⊗) = Δa
k(eS
⊗) + O(ℏk+1) .
(4.5.28)
Furthermore, using (4.2.26) we obtain the identity
[δa, δb] = −f abcδc ,
(4.5.29)
which we insert into [δa, δb] Γk(eS
⊗). This yields the consistency condition
δaΔb
k(eS
⊗) −δbΔa
k(eS
⊗) = −f abc Δc
k(eS
⊗) + O(ℏk+1) .
(4.5.30)
From S = κ L(g) , g ∈D(M) and the Locality of Δk (4.3.4), we conclude that
Δa
k(eS
⊗) ∈Floc[[κ]]. Taking into account Exer. 1.3.5, we see that also δbΔa
k(eS
⊗) ∈
Floc[[κ]]. That is, each term in (4.5.30) is of the form (1.3.8). Therefore, the
consistency condition (4.5.30) holds true on the entire conﬁguration space C ≡
C∞(M, R), i.e., the restriction of the functionals to D(M, R) can be omitted.
Local ﬁelds of the form
Δa
k = δaFk
for some
Fk ∈Floc ,
Fk = O(ℏk) ,
(4.5.31)
obviously solve the consistency condition (4.5.30).
As roughly explained below, every local ﬁeld solving (4.5.30) is of the form
(4.5.31). In particular this holds for the integrated anomaly Δa
k(eS
⊗) (up to terms of
order O(ℏk+1)), since it is given by (4.5.26), hence satisﬁes (4.5.28) and, therefore,
solves (4.5.30). So we conclude that

ties “Locality and Translation covariance” (3.6.34) and “Scaling degree” (3.6.35).
We remark that Z>
k (S) is not uniquely determined.
Finally, the above-given claim about the solutions of the consistency condi-
tion (4.5.30) relies on deep results of Lie algebra cohomology (see [135, Sect. 3.5.2]
and references cited there): Local ﬁelds solving the consistency condition (4.5.30)
are called “cocycles” and trivial solutions of the form (4.5.31) are called “cobound-
aries”. Now, o(N) is semisimple and the ﬁrst cohomology of a semisimple Lie al-
gebra which takes values in a ﬁnite-dimensional representation is trivial (this is
“Whitehead’s Lemma”), that is, every cocycle is a coboundary. Since one can show
that there exists a ﬁnite dimensional subspace V of Floc containing Δa
k(eS

Chapter 5
Quantum Electrodynamics
QED is the prime example for the application of QFT to elementary particle
physics. From a pragmatic point of view the construction of QED is solved since
the works of Tomonaga, Schwinger, Feynman and Dyson in the middle of the last
century: The predictions (e.g., on the magnetic moment of the electron), obtained
by computing the lowest orders of the perturbation series, are in perfect agreement
with experiment. However, fundamental theoretical questions remained: First of
all, there is the question of convergence of the perturbation series, which is still
unsolved and which we do not touch in this book. Whereas the problem of ultra-
violet divergences can be reduced to a freedom of ﬁnite renormalizations by the
Epstein–Glaser method, the infrared problem is only partially solved, cf. [157].
One aspect is that charged particles cannot be eigenstates of the mass operator
(they have to be “infraparticles” [30, 152]). Another aspect of the infrared problem
are the divergences which appear in the adiabatic limit g(x) →1 of the S-matrix,
cf. Sect. 3.7 and App. A.6. In QED these divergences are logarithmic and cancel in
the cross section. (This is shown at least to lowest orders of the perturbation series
[148].) Moreover, Blanchard–Seneor [9] and Duch [38] proved that the adiabatic
limit deﬁning Green and Wightman functions exists and is unique for QED, see
App. A.6.
A perturbative construction of QED by means of the Epstein–Glaser renor-
malization is given in [148]. A main merit of this book is that the lowest orders
of the S-matrix of QED are explicitly calculated – this demonstrates that the
Epstein–Glaser method is not only well suited to clarify conceptual issues, but
also that it is useful for practical computations. Our construction of QED diﬀers
from the procedure in that book surely by the application of deformation quanti-
zation; hence, Fock space will be used only at a late stage, for the representation of
the algebra of interacting ﬁelds. But, a physically more important diﬀerence is that
our construction is local, it relies on the algebraic adiabatic limit (see Sect. 3.7).
We do not perform the adiabatic limit in the sense of Epstein and Glaser (see
App. A.6), as done in [148], and hence we do not meet any IR-divergences. For

this reason, our procedure can be applied to massless non-Abelian gauge theories,
in particular to quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
More in detail, for an arbitrary ﬁnite region O, for simplicity we take a
double cone (3.7.7), we construct the algebra AL(O) of observables localized in
O by proceeding as follows: First we perform the algebraic adiabatic limit for
the interacting ﬁelds localized in O. Then, we eliminate the non-observable ﬁelds;
a crucial input for this step is that the observables should be BRST-invariant.
To construct physical states, we proceed as in (2.5.4): We represent the algebra
AL(O) in a pre Hilbert space. The main problem in the construction of such
a representation is that the ﬁeld algebra (which contains non-observable ﬁelds)
cannot be nontrivially represented in a pre Hilbert space, only a representation
in a space with an indeﬁnite inner product is possible (“positivity problem”).
However, as we will demonstrate, the algebra of observables, which is a kind of
sub-algebra of the ﬁeld algebra, possesses a representation in a pre Hilbert space.
We restrict our study of QED to d = 4 dimensions; essentially we follow [48].
We put the focus more on conceptual issues than on computational techniques.
5.1
Deformation quantization for fermionic
and gauge ﬁelds
The main aim of this section is to generalize deformation quantization of the free
real scalar ﬁeld, developed in Chaps. 1 and 2, to the basic ﬁelds appearing in a
BRST formulation of QED: These are the Dirac spinors, the photon ﬁeld and the
Faddeev–Popov ghost ﬁelds. We will also explain the modiﬁcations appearing in
the axioms for the R- and T -product and in their inductive constructions.
5.1.1
Dirac spinors
To some extent, the stuﬀpresented here is a mathematically more elementary version of
[142]. We assume that the reader is familiar with a description of Dirac spinors in the
framework of relativistic quantum mechanics.
A Dirac spinor ψ(x) is a complex ﬁeld with 4 components, which is subject
to Fermi statistics. In detail, the formalism introduced for a real scalar ﬁeld is
modiﬁed as follows.
Single spinor ﬁeld. A single spinor is the evaluation functional
ψ(x):

C∞(M, C4) −→C4
h ≡(hk)k=1,...,4 −→ψ(x)(h) = h(x) .
(5.1.1)
Under the Lorentz group L↑
+ (or more precisely SL(2, C)), ψ(x) transforms ac-
cording to the representation D( 1
2 ,0) ⊕D(0, 1
2 ); details are given in (5.1.23)–(5.1.24)
below.

5.1.
Deformation quantization for fermionic and gauge ﬁelds
351
Let γμ ∈C4×4, μ = 0, 1, 2, 3, be the γ-matrices, which satisfy the anticom-
mutation relation
[γμ, γν]+ := γμγν + γνγμ = 2 gμν 14×4 .
(5.1.2)
We will exclusively work with representations of the γ-matrices which are unitarily
equivalent to the Chiral-representation: γμ = U γμ
Chiral U −1 for some U ∈U(4);
for example the Dirac- or the Majorana-representation, see, e.g., [109, App. A2].
These representations have the nice property that
γ0 γμ γ0 = γμ † ,
or equivalently
γ0 † = γ0 ,
γk † = −γk
for
k = 1, 2, 3 ,
(5.1.3)
where † means the adjoint matrix in spinor space, i.e., in C4×4. For a Lorentz
covariant vector a ≡(aμ)μ=0,1,2,3 we use the standard notation /a := aμγμ . In
addition,144 let ψ(x) := ψ†(x) γ0. Explicitly, ψ(x) is the functional
ψ(x):

C∞(M, C4) −→C1×4
h −→ψ(x)(h) = h†(x) γ0 =
4
k=1 hk(x)c (γ0)kj

j=1,...,4 ,
which is anti-linear, due to complex conjugation. In the following ψ(x) and ψ(x)
are treated as independent ﬁelds. This is analogous to the independence of φ(x)
and φ∗(x) for a complex scalar ﬁeld – see Exap. 1.3.2.
Classical product. According to Fermi statistics, the classical product of Dirac
spinors must be anticommutative. Therefore, our bosonic deﬁnition (1.2.5) cannot
be transferred to fermionic ﬁelds. So we are looking for an alternative deﬁnition of
the bosonic classical product which indicates how to proceed for fermionic ﬁelds:
The bosonic classical product can be deﬁned as symmetrized tensor product. The
n-fold product of a real scalar ﬁeld ϕ reads
ϕ(x1) ⊗sym · · · ⊗sym ϕ(xn) := Sn ϕ(x1) ⊗· · · ⊗ϕ(xn): C∞(M, R)×n −→R ;
(h1, . . . , hn) −→1
n!

π∈Sn
hπ1(x1) · · · · · hπn(xn) ,
(5.1.4)
where Sn denotes symmetrization of the n-fold tensor product. The symmetrized
tensor product is certainly commutative; it is also associative, in particular the
relation

ϕ(x1)⊗sym · · · ⊗sym ϕ(xr)

⊗sym

ϕ(xr+1) ⊗sym · · · ⊗sym ϕ(xr+s)

= ϕ(x1) ⊗sym · · · ⊗sym ϕ(xr+s)
(5.1.5)
144In the presence of spinor ﬁelds we denote complex conjugation by an upper index “c”, i.e., zc
instead of z; for example,

ψ

k(x) = 
l ψl(x)c (γ0)lk.

holds true for all r, s ∈N∗. Deﬁnition 1.2.1 can be modiﬁed accordingly: A bosonic
ﬁeld is then a functional of the form
F(ϕ):

n=1 C∞(M, R)×n −→C
F(ϕ) := N
n=0

fn(x1, . . . , xn), ϕ(x1) ⊗sym · · · ⊗sym ϕ(xn)

(x1,...,xn) ,
where N < ∞and fn is as in Deﬁnition 1.2.1. Motivated by (5.1.5), the classical
product F · G ≡F ⊗sym G is deﬁned by
⟨fr, ϕ⊗sym r⟩⊗sym ⟨gs, ϕ⊗sym s⟩:= ⟨fr ⊗gs, ϕ⊗sym(r+s)⟩: C∞(M, R)×(r+s) −→C
(5.1.6)
and by bilinearity.
Turning to Dirac spinor ﬁelds, the symmetrized tensor product of basic ﬁelds
is replaced by the antisymmetric wedge product of basic ﬁelds (which is essentially
the antisymmetrized tensor product). The wedge product is also associative. In
detail, the classical product of n basic ﬁelds is deﬁned to be a map
ψ(x1) ∧· · · ∧ψ(xl) ∧ψ(xl+1) ∧· · · ∧ψ(xn) : C∞(M, C4)×n −→C(4n)
(5.1.7)
(for all 0 ≤l ≤n) which is given by
ψk1(x1) ∧· · · ∧ψkl(xl) ∧ψkl+1(xl+1) ∧· · · ∧ψkn(xn)
(5.1.8)
:= n! ψk1(x1) ⊗as · · · ⊗as ψkl(xl) ⊗as ψkl+1(xl+1) ⊗as · · · ⊗as ψkn(xn) ,

Remark 5.1.1. An alternative formulation of the classical product of spinor ﬁelds,
which makes explicit that ψ(x) and ψ(x) are independent ﬁelds, is as follows: Let
C1 := C∞(M, C4) ⊕C∞(M, C4)
(5.1.11)
and for
H = (h1, h2) ∈C1
set
ψ(x)(H) := h1(x) ,
ψ(x)(H) := h2(x) .

tage of being linear; the latter is also due to a modiﬁcation of the domain of

The derivative w.r.t. the factor at the jth position is performed after anticom-
muting this factor to the ﬁrst position. For this reason, (5.1.13)–(5.1.14) is also
called the functional derivative acting from the left-hand side; cf. (5.1.33). Note

fulﬁlls jμ(x)∗= jμ(x), due to γμ † γ0 = γ0 γμ (5.1.3). Note that jμ(x)c = −jμ(x);
hence, if we would deﬁne the ∗-operation only by complex conjugation (as we do
for the complex scalar ﬁeld, see Exap. 1.3.2), we would have ω(jμ) ∈iR for any
state ω (Deﬁnition 2.5.1), instead of the expected relation ω(jμ) ∈R.
Free ﬁeld equations. The free action for Dirac spinors reads

≡S0(ψ, ψ) :=
	
dy ψ(y) ∧(i/∂y −m 14×4)ψ(y) ,
(5.1.28)
for brevity we will omit 14×4. The pertinent free ﬁeld equations are the Dirac
equation and its adjoint:
0 =
δS0
δψ(x) = (i/∂−m)ψ(x)
and
0 =
δS0
δψ(x) = i∂μψ(x)γμ + mψ(x) . (5.1.29)

Star product. The star product has two diﬀerent propagators, the Wightman two-

(5.1.30)
Note that S± is a matrix in spinor space: S± ∈D′(M, C4×4). We point out that
S−(x) ̸= −S+(−x). Analogously to Δ+
m(x), the propagators S+
m, S−
m fulﬁll the free
ﬁeld equations, which are the Dirac equation and its adjoint:
(i/∂x −m)S±
m(x) = 0
and
i∂μ
xS±
m(x)γμ −m S±
m(x) = 0 ;
(5.1.31)
this follows from
(i/∂x −m)(i/∂x + m) = −(□+ m2) .
(5.1.32)
To deﬁne the star product we introduce the functional derivative acting from
the right-hand side:
δr
δψ(y) ψ(x1) ∧· · · ∧ψ(xn) := (−1)n−1
δ
δψ(y) ψ(x1) ∧· · · ∧ψ(xn)
(5.1.33)
and similarly for δr/δψ(y). The purpose of the factor (−1)n−1 is that the term
∼δ(xn−l −y), i.e., the term coming from the functional derivative acting on the
factor at the (l + 1)th position from the right-hand side, has the sign (−1)l –
in accordance with the prescription that the derivative w.r.t. this factor is per-
formed after anticommuting it to the position furthest to the right. For the higher
derivatives we write
δk

S−is (y... −x...) (and not (x... −y...)). For brevity we shall write Fspinor for
Fspinor[[ℏ]], as we do for scalar ﬁelds.
Example 5.1.4. For jμ being the electromagnetic current of the free theory (5.1.27) we
obtain

where we use matrix notation for the spinors and tr(·) denotes the trace in C4×4.
By using the wave front set properties of F, G ∈Fspinor and
WF(S±) = WF

(i/∂x + m)Δ+
m(±x)

⊆WF(Δ+)
(see App. A.3, property (c)), one veriﬁes that F ⋆G exists and that F ⋆G lies
again in Fspinor; the argumentation is essentially the same as for the real scalar
ﬁeld (Sect. 2.4).
Let us check whether our requirements on the star product, given in Sect. 2.1,
are satisﬁed also by the star product for spinor ﬁelds (Deﬁnition 5.1.3) – of course,
the formulation of some requirements needs to be adapted. Bilinearity and
F ⋆G = F ∧G + O(ℏ)
for
F, G ∼ℏ0
are obvious. Associativity can be proved by essentially the same method as for
the real scalar ﬁeld (Sect. 2.4); the relation of the “graded” commutator to the
Poisson bracket is explained below, see (5.1.36)–(5.1.40). Due to (5.1.31), the star
product is compatible with the free ﬁeld equation, that is,

covariant, this holds also for the star product:

∀F, G ∈Fspinor , (A, a) ∈SL(2, C) × Rd ,

where (5.1.23) is used. Finally, for scalar ﬁelds, the compatibility of the star pro-
duct with the ∗-operation is an immediate consequence of Δ+(x)c = Δ+(−x)
(2.1.10), but for spinor ﬁelds the corresponding proof requires some work:
Lemma 5.1.5. For F, G ∈Fspinor it holds that
(F ⋆G)∗= G∗⋆F ∗.

Graded commutator and Poisson bracket. By means of the Bose–Fermi grading
(5.1.20), we deﬁne a graded commutator:146 for (F, G) ∈Fp

if
(p, q) = (+, +), (+, −), (−, +)
F ⋆G + G ⋆F
if
(p, q) = (−, −)

and extend this deﬁnition to F, G ∈Fspinor by bilinearity of the star product.
According to the principles of deformation quantization (2.0.1), the formula
for the Poisson bracket {F, G}, for F, G ∈Fspinor, can be obtained from [F, G]⋆
by selecting all terms with precisely one contraction:
{F, G} = lim

spinor, where we have “+” for (p, q) = (−, −) and “−”
for (p, q) = (+, +), (+, −), (−, +). In the derivation of this formula, we take into
account that δF/δψ = δrF/δψ for F ∈F−
spinor, and δF/δψ = −δrF/δψ for F ∈

spinor, and similarly for δ/δψ.
Let us verify that formula (5.1.40) satisﬁes the usual properties of a Poisson
bracket, that is, the properties listed in part (ii) of Proposition 1.8.5 adapted to
the Bose–Fermi grading: Bilinearity and graded skew-symmetry are obvious. For
the graded Leibniz rule and the graded Jacobi identity we can argue as for the
real scalar ﬁeld: The former follows from the graded Leibniz rule for δ(G ∧H)/δψ
and δ(G∧H)/δψ, respectively, and the latter is the graded Jacobi identity for the
graded commutator to lowest non-vanishing order in ℏ, see (2.4.7)–(2.4.8).
Exercise 5.1.6 (Spacelike commutativity). Prove that Lemma 2.4.1 holds true also for the

Exercise 5.1.7 (Charge belonging to the free electromagnetic current). In this exercise
all functionals are restricted to Cspinor,S0, we write F0 := F|Cspinor,S0 . We introduce the
charge
Qψ


d⃗x j0(c, ⃗x)0 ,
where
jμ(x)0 := ψ0(x) ∧γμψ0(x)
(5.1.41)
and c ∈R is ﬁxed; we will study the graded commutator

The existence of integrals of the kind (5.1.41) is explained after (5.5.25) for the free
Kugo–Ojima charge.
This exercise investigates only the commutator (5.1.42): Explain why the region of
integration is bounded and why this commutator does not depend on the choice of c ∈R.
In addition, derive the commutation relation
[Qψ
0 , ψ0(x1) ∧· · · ∧ψ0(xs) ∧ψ0(y1) ∧· · · ∧ψ0(yr)]⋆

(5.1.43)
Hence, for on-shell ﬁelds the operator F0 −→−1
ℏ[Qψ
0 , F0]⋆may be interpreted as charge
number operator, as introduced later in (5.1.99).
[Solution: Due to Exer. 5.1.6 the region of integration in (5.1.42) is a subset of
{ ⃗x
 (c, ⃗x) ∈supp F + (V + ∪V −) } ,
which is bounded for all c ∈R, since supp F is bounded. Using ∂μ
x [jμ(x)0 , F0]⋆= 0 and
Gauss’ integral theorem (A.1.13), we ﬁnd that [Qψ
0 , F0]⋆(5.1.42) does not depend on c.
Hence, considering
[Qψ
0 , ψ0(y)]⋆= iℏ

x0=c
d⃗x ψ0(x)γ0 S(x −y) ,
we may choose c := y0. By using (A.2.14) we get
γ0 S(0, ⃗z) = (i∂0 −iγ0γk∂k + γ0m) Δ(0, ⃗z) = −i δ(⃗z) ,
which yields [Qψ
0 , ψ0(y)]⋆= ℏψ0(y). Analogously we derive [Qψ
0 , ψ0(y)]⋆= −ℏψ0(y).

Retarded product. The axioms for the retarded product, given in Sect. 3.1, are
modiﬁed as follows – we only explain the changes. We start with the basic axioms:
• Domain and range: Let F±
spinor,loc := Fspinor,loc∩F±
spinor. The retarded product
Rn,1 is a collection of 2n+1 linear maps
R(p1,...,pn+1)
n,1
: Fp1
spinor,loc ⊗· · ·⊗Fpn+1
spinor,loc →Fp
spinor where p := p1 · · · · ·pn+1
(5.1.44)
and p1, . . . , pn+1 ∈{+, −} ≡{1, −1} ; the upper indices (p1, . . . , pn+1) are
mostly omitted. Since the sum of a Bose and a Fermi ﬁeld is ill deﬁned –
only the direct sum (5.1.20) makes sense – one has to distinguish these 2n+1
maps.
• Graded symmetry: Axiom (b) is now a graded symmetry,
R(pπ1,...,pπn,pn+1)
n,1
(Fπ1⊗· · ·⊗Fπn, F) = sgngπ R(p1,...,pn,pn+1)
n,1
(F1⊗· · ·⊗Fn, F)
(5.1.45)
for all π ∈Sn. By sgngπ we mean the “graded signature” of π, which depends
on π and on the signs (p1, . . . , pn) and is a generalization of the signature of
π. To deﬁne it, write π as a product of transpositions, π = t1 ◦· · · ◦tk. If
tj is a transposition of two Fermi ﬁelds we set sgngtj := −1 and in all other
cases (i.e., for transpositions of Bose with Bose ﬁelds and Bose with Fermi
ﬁelds) we set sgngtj = 1. Then we set sgngπ := sgngt1 · · · · ·sgngtk. It is well
known that sgngπ is uniquely determined by this prescription, although the
representation of π as a product of transpositions and even the number k of
transpositions are non-unique. In particular, if p1 = . . . = pn = −1, we have
sgngπ = sgn π.
We point out that interacting ﬁelds148

ertheless, a generating functional for the retarded or time-ordered product of
spinor ﬁelds can be introduced by means of the η-trick explained below, see
Remk. 5.1.10.
• Turning to the GLZ relation (axiom (e)), let us ﬁrst study the case in which
the interaction is a Bose ﬁeld. Then, the commutator is replaced by the

where [·, ·]⋆is the graded commutator. If (p, q) = (−, −), the l.h.s. is sym-
metric under G ↔H and, hence, there is a “+” for the second term on the
r.h.s.. For all other values of (p, q), the l.h.s. is antisymmetric and we have
the “−” sign on the r.h.s..
To determine the signs appearing in the GLZ relation in the general case,
i.e., for R(F1 ⊗· · ·⊗Fn−1, Fn) with Fj ∈Fpj
spinor,loc, pj ∈{+, −} arbitrary, we
use a formal trick (“η-trick”), which is often used to compute signs coming
from Fermi statistics, see, e.g., [109, Sect. 4-2-2]. Let (ηj)J
j=1, where J ≤∞,
be the generators of a Grassmann algebra, that is, they are anticommuting
variables:
ηjηk = −ηkηj
∀1 ≤j ≤k ≤J ≤∞.
For the abstract deﬁnition of a Grassmann algebra we refer to [96, Sect. 6.2.1].
Frequently the product of Grassmann variables is deﬁned more explicitly as
the wedge product of diﬀerential forms (see, e.g., [173, Sect. 9], [148, App. D]);
following usual conventions we write ηjηk instead of ηj ∧ηk. The ﬁelds
˜Fj :=

1 ⊗Fj
if
pj = +
ηj ⊗Fj
if
pj = −,

obey Bose statistics. Deﬁning

we obtain relations as, e.g.,

= (η1η4η3η5) ⊗

.
The retarded product R( ˜F1, . . . , ˜Fn−1; ˜Fn) fulﬁlls the GLZ relation for Bose
ﬁelds, as it is given in (3.1.11b)–(3.1.12). From that the signs of the GLZ
relation for R(F1, . . . , Fn−1; Fn) can be derived by bringing the η’s in the
same order in all terms.
With this trick, the graded symmetry of the retarded product of a mix-
ture of Bose and Fermi ﬁelds, given in (5.1.45), can be traced back to the

5.1.
Deformation quantization for fermionic and gauge ﬁelds
365
symmetry of the retarded product of Bose ﬁelds, and similarly for the time-
ordered product (see (5.1.59) below). We illustrate the procedure by an ex-
ample.
Example 5.1.8. For Fj ∈F−
spinor,loc (j = 1, 2, 3, 4) we get the following signs in the GLZ
relation:
R(F1,F2, F3; F4) + R(F1, F2, F4; F3) = −i

[R(F1, F2, F3); R(F4)]+
−[R(F1; F3), R(F2; F4)] + [R(F2; F3), R(F1; F4)] + [R(F3), R(F1, F2; F4)]+

,
where [·, ·] denotes the commutator and [·, ·]+ the anticommutator. For example, the
second term on the r.h.s. is obtained as follows:
[R( ˜F1, ˜F3), R( ˜F2, ˜F4)] = (η1η3η2η4) ⊗

R(F1, F3) ⋆R(F2, F4)

−(η2η4η1η3) ⊗

R(F2, F4) ⋆R(F1, F3)

= −(η1η2η3η4) ⊗[R(F1, F3), R(F2, F4)] .
The renormalization conditions are modiﬁed as follows:
• The Field independence (axiom (f)) and the ∗-structure (axiom (g)) have an
additional sign, which is due to Fermi statistics: The former axiom reads
δ

l=1

and similarly for δ/δψ, where πl is the permutation
πl : (ψ, F1, . . . , Fn) −→(F1, . . . , Fl−1, ψ, Fl, . . . , Fn) .
Similarly to scalar ﬁeld theory, Field independence is equivalent to the causal
Wick expansion (3.1.24)
The additional sign for the ∗-structure axiom (3.1.29) can be motivated
from the formula for the unrenormalized retarded product (3.1.69) (where
[·, ·]⋆means now the graded commutator) and from the following relations
which hold for (F, G) ∈Fp

where the minus-sign holds for (p, q) = (−, −) and the plus-sign for all other
cases; the latter relation follows immediately from Lemma 5.1.5. Computing
in this way the ∗-conjugation of formula (3.1.69), we obtain
Rn−1,1(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn)∗= (−1)⌊f/2⌋Rn−1,1(F ∗

n) ,
(5.1.50)
for the unrenormalized R-product, where f is the number of Fermi ﬁelds in
F1, . . . , Fn and ⌊·⌋denotes the integer part. The ∗-structure axiom requires
that this formula holds also for the renormalized R-product.

366
Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
In the following exercise, we derive the sign in (5.1.50) in an alternative
way, by using the η-trick (5.1.48) with the additional deﬁnitions:

(aj1 · · · ajk) ⊗F
∗:= (aj1 · · · ajk)∗⊗F ∗,
(aj1 · · · ajk)∗:= ajk · · · aj1
for aj ∈{1, ηj} and F ∈Fspinor. In particular, it follows a∗
j = aj.
Exercise 5.1.9. Derive formula (5.1.50) from the bosonic version of the ∗-structure

we see that the sign we want to compute is the graded signature of the permutation
π : (a1, . . . , an) −→(an, . . . , a1). We may omit the aj which are equal to 1, that
is, we may replace π by ˜π : (ηj1, . . . , ηjf ) −→(ηjf , . . . , ηj1) where jk < jk+1 for all
k. With that, the graded signature of π is equal to the signature of ˜π, and for the
latter we get
sgn ˜π = (−1)f(f−1)/2 =

(−1)f·f/2−f/2 = (−1)f/2
if f is even
(−1)(f−1)·(f−1)/2+(f−1)/2 = (−1)(f−1)/2
if f is odd,
which agrees with the sign in (5.1.50).]

spinor,loc. There are two Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equations corresponding
to
δr(S0+F )
δψ(x)
and
δr(S0+F )
δψ(x)
, respectively – in view of the generalization to
F ∈F−
spinor,loc, given in (5.1.57) below, it is better to work with the functional

• The Sm-expansion axiom can be required also for Dirac spinors, details are
given below.
• The substitute for the Field parity axiom (3.1.30) (or (3.1.34)) is Charge num-
ber conservation, which we introduce in (5.1.101); and in Step 1 of Sect. 5.2.2
we explain how this renormalization condition can be fulﬁlled and in which
sense it plays the same role as the Field parity axiom (Remk. 5.2.4).

Similarly to the doublet (S+, S−) of propagators for the star product, there are
two diﬀerent kinds of propagators for the classical retarded product:149 by using

(5.1.52)
Sret and Sav are called the “retarded and advanced propagator for spinor
ﬁelds”, respectively. For scalar ﬁelds we have not introduced the advanced prop-
agator, since it is given by Δav
m(x) := Δret
m (−x), but for spinor ﬁelds it holds
that Sm(−x) ̸= −Sm(x) and, hence, Sav
m (x) ̸= Sret
m (−x). By using (5.1.38) and

∂0


Δm(z) = δ(z0) Δm(z) = 0 (see (A.2.14)), we obtain

into its retarded part (support ⊆V +) and its advanced part (support ⊆V −).
149Due to the h-dependence axiom (axiom (l)), the statement (3.1.71) about the classical limit
holds also in the presence of spinor ﬁelds, in particular we use here that limℏ→0 1

and ψF (x) = R

respectively, by using (5.1.55).
Turning to the Sm-expansion axiom (axiom (k)), we ﬁrst deﬁne the mass
dimension of Dirac spinors in d = 4 dimensions:
dim ∂aψ := dim ∂aψ := 3
2 + |a| ,
(5.1.58)
in agreement with the procedure given in Remk. 3.1.19.
From Lemma 3.1.26(3) we conclude that Sret(z) = (i/∂z + m) Δret
m (z) fulﬁlls
the Sm-expansion with degree 2 + 1 = 3. Since dim ψ + dim ψ is also equal to 3,
the VEV r(ψ, ψ)(z) = ℏSret(z) fulﬁlls the Sm-expansion axiom.
The formulation of this axiom for (real) scalar ﬁelds (given in Sect. 3.1.5) can
verbatim be used for spinor ﬁelds – this holds not only for the example r(ψ, ψ), it
is generally true. Also for spinor ﬁelds, the Sm-expansion axiom is required for all
r(A1, . . . , An), where A1, . . . , An are arbitrary ﬁeld monomials. Again this axiom
plays the role of a renormalization condition.
When using the stronger version of the Sm-expansion axiom (axiom (k) with
the addition (k′)), a signiﬁcant diﬀerence to the case of scalar ﬁelds is the following:
For scalar ﬁelds in d = 4 dimensions solely even powers of m appear in the Sm-
expansion of r(A1, . . . , An), as explained in Remk. 3.2.26. But for Dirac spinors
in d = 4 dimensions also odd powers of m appear – already in the Sm-expansion
of Sret/av
m
all natural numbers appear as powers of m, cf. Exer. 3.1.24.
Time-ordered product. The axioms for the time-ordered product are modiﬁed ac-
cordingly. We give the changes only for the basic axioms and the ﬁeld equation:

and from this the T-product of spinor ﬁelds is obtained by requiring (5.1.61) also

equal, we rewrite this deﬁnition more explicitly, by using (3.3.37) for non-diagonal
entries.

The reasoning given in (3.3.36) applies also here: The deﬁnition (5.1.71) im-
plies that causal factorization of Tn( ˜F1⊗· · ·⊗˜Fn) (3.3.5) is equivalent to anticausal
factorization of T n( ˜F1 ⊗· · · ⊗˜Fn) (3.3.35). It is instructive to check this explicitly
to lowest orders:

T 2( ˜F1 ⊗˜F2) = −T2( ˜F1 ⊗˜F2) + ˜F1 ⋆˜F2 + ˜F2 ⋆˜F1 = T 1( ˜F2) ⋆T 1( ˜F1) .

is called the “anti-Feynman propagator for spinor ﬁelds”.]
Remark 5.1.13 (Bogoliubov formula for spinor ﬁelds). One veriﬁes straightfor-
wardly that the axioms for the R- and T -product of spinor ﬁelds (given in this
section) imply that the pertinent Rn−1,1( ˜F1⊗· · · , ˜Fn) (5.1.49) and Tn( ˜F1⊗· · ·⊗˜Fn)
(5.1.61) satisfy the axioms for the R- and T -product of bosonic ﬁelds (given in
Sect. 3.1 and 3.3.2, respectively) with suitable modiﬁcations concerning the do-
main and range of the maps Rn−1,1 and Tn. Therefore, the R- and T -products of
the ˜F-ﬁelds fulﬁll Proposition 3.3.14, that is, they are connected by the Bogoliubov
formula:
Rn,1( ˜F1 ⊗· · · ⊗˜Fn, ˜G) = in

I⊆{1,...,n}
(−1)|I| T |I|( ˜FI) ⋆T|Ic|+1( ˜FIc ⊗˜G) , (5.1.73)
where ˜FJ := ⊗j∈J ˜Fj; note that in the sum an (I = ∅)-term appears. From (5.1.73)
we can read oﬀthe Bogoliubov formula for R- and T -products of spinor ﬁelds
including all signs coming from Fermi statistics.
Some techniques to compute T - or R-products containing spinor ﬁelds are
explained in Sect. 5.1.7.

Faddeev–Popov ghosts: A pair of anticommuting scalar ﬁelds
Generally, “ghost ﬁelds” are unphysical or unobservable ﬁelds, which may be
bosonic or fermionic; they are a mathematical tool for a consistent quantization
of spin 1 or spin 2 ﬁelds. An example for a bosonic ghost ﬁeld is the “St¨uckelberg
ﬁeld”, which is a real scalar ﬁeld and is usually introduced for the quantization of
a massive spin 1 ﬁeld, see, e.g., [58, Sect. 3]. The Faddeev–Popov ghost ﬁelds are
a pair151 (u, ˜u) of complex scalar ﬁelds, which obey Fermi statistics. They were
ﬁrst introduced by Feynman [72], to remove an inconsistency appearing in naive
one-loop calculations for Yang–Mills theories. Faddeev and Popov [69] introduced
these ghost ﬁelds more systematically: They used them to solve the problem that
in the functional integral quantization of Yang–Mills theories one has to integrate
over classes of gauge equivalent ﬁelds instead of integrating over all gauge ﬁelds.
A few years later, Becchi, Rouet and Stora [7, 8] and Tyutin [164] developed a
rigorous quantization method for (massless and massive) spin 1 ﬁelds – the fa-
mous “BRST quantization” – for which the Faddeev–Popov ghosts are a crucial
ingredient, as explained in Sect. 5.4.1.
In QED the anticommuting Faddeev–Popov ghost ﬁelds do not couple (i.e.,
they do not appear in the interaction Lagrangian) and could therefore be elimi-
nated. However, in view of the generalization to non-Abelian gauge theories, we
aim to formulate the gauge structure by means of the BRST formalism, for this
purpose we need these ghost ﬁelds.
In detail, we introduce a pair U(x) :=
u(x)
˜u(x)

βΛ,au(x) = u(Λx + a) ,
βΛ,a˜u(x) = ˜u(Λx + a)
∀(Λ, a) ∈P↑
+ ;
U1 = u is called “ghost ﬁeld” and U2 = ˜u “anti-ghost ﬁeld”. We point out: Al-
though u and ˜u are spin zero ﬁelds obeying Fermi statistics, they do not violate
the famous Spin-Statistics Theorem (see, e.g., [162]), because they do not satisfy
all assumptions of this theorem, for details we refer to [117] and [149, Sect. 1.2].
Similarly to spinor ﬁelds, the classical product of ghost ﬁelds is the antisym-
metric ∧-product. The conﬁguration space reads
Cghost :=
∞
*
n=1
C∞(M, C2)×n ;
(5.1.74)
151For Yang–Mills theories (introduced in Exer. 1.5.2) there is, for each component Aa of the
gauge ﬁeld, a pair (ua, ˜ua) of ghost ﬁelds.
152That we write the pair (u, ˜u) as a two-dimensional vector is only for notational convenience,
it does not have any physical signiﬁcance.

Fghost (acting from the left- or right-hand side) is deﬁned similarly to spinor ﬁelds,
see (5.1.14), (5.1.17) and (5.1.33).
In contrast to the model of a bosonic complex scalar ﬁeld (see Exap. 1.3.2),
the ∗-operation is not deﬁned by complex conjugation, and ˜u is not the ∗-conjugate
of u: A frequently used convention is
u∗(x) := u(x)

In our treatment of QED solely time-ordered (or retarded) products Tn(F1 ⊗
· · · ⊗Fn) appear for which at most one factor Fk contains the ghost ﬁelds u or ˜u.
Due to linearity of T , we may assume that this sole factor is of the form
Fk =
	
dx g(x) Q(u, ˜u)(x) ⊗P(ψ, ψ, A)(x) ,
where g ∈D(M) and Q and P are polynomials (with respect to the ∧-product) in
partial derivatives of the ﬁelds written in their arguments, cf. (5.1.22) and (5.1.96).
For such T -products we may require
Tn(· · ·⊗Fk⊗· · · ) =
	
dx g(x) Q(u, ˜u)(x)⊗Tn(· · ·⊗P(ψ, ψ, A)(x)⊗· · · ) ; (5.1.81)
that is, the ghost ﬁelds behave as classical (or “external”) ﬁelds. To see how the
requirement (5.1.81) can be fulﬁlled, we follow the inductive construction of the
T -product: In the inductive step outside the thin diagonal (see (3.3.18)) the con-
dition (5.1.81) cannot be violated, because there is no contraction partner for
Q(u, ˜u)(x); hence, (5.1.81) is a renormalization condition. To extend Q(u, ˜u)(x)
⊗T 0
n(· · · ⊗P(ψ, ψ, A)(x) ⊗· · · ) to the thin diagonal, we simply extend T 0
n(· · ·
· · · ⊗P(ψ, ψ, A) ⊗· · · ) such that the latter extension satisﬁes all other renormali-
zation conditions – this yields (5.1.81).
5.1.3
The photon ﬁeld
The photon ﬁeld is a gauge ﬁeld. Gauge theories are ﬁeld theories in which dif-
ferent ﬁeld conﬁgurations describe the same observable; such conﬁgurations are
connected by a “gauge transformation”. In the classical theory the Cauchy prob-
lem153 is well posed for the observables, but in general not for the non-observable,
“gauge dependent” basic ﬁelds Aμ(x), due to the existence of time-dependent
gauge transformations.
153For the free photon ﬁeld the Cauchy problem for Aμ(x) is the initial value problem given by
the free ﬁeld equation (5.1.84) below (which is a partial diﬀerential equation of second order)
and the initial values Aμ(t0, ⃗x) = fμ(⃗x) and ∂0Aμ(t0, ⃗x) = fμ
1 (⃗x), where the functions fμ(⃗x)
and fμ
1 (⃗x) are given and t0 is some ﬁxed time.

376
Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
Attempts to quantize the observables directly have not yet been completely
satisfactory and, hence, we do not follow that way. In perturbation theory the non-
uniqueness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem for Aμ(x) shows up already for
the free gauge ﬁelds. We will solve this problem in the usual way: We will modify
the classical, free action by adding a gauge ﬁxing term such that the dynamics of
the classical observables of the free theory is not changed and the Cauchy problem
for Aμ(x) becomes unique.
In the perturbative interacting theory, the observables should be independent
on how the gauge ﬁxing for the free theory is done (“gauge independence”). In
the framework of causal perturbation theory this has been shown for the physical
S-matrix (i.e., the S-matrix as an operator Sphys : H −→H, where H is the pre
Hilbert space of physical states, introduced in Sect. 5.4.2) in reference [1], under
the assumption that the IR-behaviour is unproblematic.
Gauge ﬁxing. In our formalism, the photon ﬁeld

Aμ(x)

μ=0,1,2,3 is the evaluation
functional
A(x):

Cphoton := C∞(M, R4) −→R4
h ≡(hμ)μ=0,1,2,3 −→A(x)(h) = h(x) ,
(5.1.82)
cf. Exer. 1.5.2, which is a Lorentz vector:
βΛ,aAμ(x) := (Λ−1)μ
ν Aν(Λx + a)
∀(Λ, a) ∈P↑
+ .
Using F μν := ∂μAν −∂νAμ, the free action

(5.1.83)

dx Aμ(x) DμνAν(x) ,
Dμν := gμν□−∂μ∂ν ,
yields the free ﬁeld equation
0 =
δS0
δAμ(x) = DμνAν(x) .
(5.1.84)
Here, we understand S0 as “generalized Lagrangian” in the sense of Remk. 1.5.1.
Taking into account Dμν∂ν = 0, we can now explicitly see that the solutions
of the Cauchy problem are non-unique: If h ≡(hν) ∈Cphoton is a solution, then
this holds also for

hν(x) + ∂νH(x)

for an arbitrary H ∈C∞(M, R) fulﬁlling
∂νH(t0, ⃗x) = 0 and ∂0∂νH(t0, ⃗x) = 0. These conditions do not determine H(x) in
the complement of an arbitrary small neighbourhood of the set {x = (t0, ⃗x) | ⃗x ∈
R3}. Note that hν −→(hν + ∂νH) is a time-dependent gauge transformation of a
ﬁeld conﬁguration.
The usual way out is to modify the free action by adding a Lorentz invariant
gauge ﬁxing term: Dμν is replaced by Dμν
λ
:= Dμν + λ∂μ∂ν where λ ∈R \ {0} is

an arbitrary constant. That is, the gauge ﬁxing term reads

(5.1.85)
For the Euler–Lagrange equation belonging to (Sphoton

0 ), i.e., the free ﬁeld
equation, we obtain
0 = Dμν
λ Aν(x) = □Aμ −(1 −λ)∂μ∂νAν .
(5.1.86)
The mass dimension of the photon ﬁeld is deﬁned to be
dim Aμ := 1 ,
μ = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,
for any value of λ, in agreement with Remk. 3.1.19.
For simplicity let us choose λ = 1, which is referred to as “Feynman gauge”.
The generalization to arbitrary values of λ can be found, e.g., in [1]. With λ = 1,
the free ﬁeld equation simpliﬁes to
□Aμ(x) = 0 ,
μ = 0, 1, 2, 3 .
(5.1.87)
That is, the free photon ﬁeld can be interpreted as a quadruplet of independent
real, massless scalar ﬁelds – as long as we ignore the behaviour under Lorentz
transformations. For this reason, and since also the star product is diagonal in the
components of the photon ﬁeld (i.e., contractions of diﬀerent components do not
appear – see below), the generalization of our formalism from one real scalar ﬁeld
(given in Chaps. 1 to 3) to the photon ﬁeld in Feynman gauge is obvious to a far
extent – we only mention some basic points.

Deﬁnition of the retarded and time-ordered product in QED
In the BRST formulation of a gauge theory (or vector boson theory), each gauge
(or vector boson) ﬁeld A(x) ≡(Aμ(x))μ=0,...,3 is accompanied by one pair

u(x),
˜u(x)

of Faddeev–Popov ghosts.154 So for QED we have three diﬀerent kinds of
basic ﬁelds: A pair

ψ(x), ψ(x)

of Dirac spinors, the photon ﬁeld and a pair of
Faddeev–Popov ghosts.
Field space of QED. The ﬁeld space of QED is the tensor product

154This statement includes the case in which Aμ is massive. Since the mass term

of the free Lagrangian is not gauge invariant, we avoid the notion “massive gauge ﬁeld” and call
Aμ a “massive vector boson ﬁeld”, cf. Remk. 5.4.1.

The classical and the star product are deﬁned as maps FQED × FQED −→
FQED by
(FA ⊗Fψ ⊗Fu) · (GA ⊗Gψ ⊗Gu) := (FA · GA) ⊗(Fψ ∧Gψ) ⊗(Fu ∧Gu) ,
(FA ⊗Fψ ⊗Fu) ⋆(GA ⊗Gψ ⊗Gu) := (FA ⋆GA) ⊗(Fψ ⋆Gψ) ⊗(Fu ⋆Gu) ,
where FA, GA ∈Fphoton , Fψ, Gψ ∈Fspinor , Fu, Gu ∈Fghost, and by bilinearity.
So the appearance of the ∧-product is suppressed in the notation for the classical
product: We simply write FG ≡F · G for F, G ∈FQED. Note also that ψ(x) and
u(y) commute with respect to the star product – although both are Fermi ﬁelds:
(1 ⊗ψ(x) ⊗1) ⋆(1 ⊗1 ⊗u(y)) = 1 ⊗ψ(x) ⊗u(y) = (1 ⊗1 ⊗u(y)) ⋆(1 ⊗ψ(x) ⊗1) .
To deﬁne the support of a QED ﬁeld F ∈FQED we generalize Def. 1.3.3:

supp δF

Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
Retarded and time-ordered product. The R- and T -product to order n −1 or n,
respectively, are maps
Rn−1,1, Tn : (Floc
QED)⊗n −→FQED
which satisfy the axioms given in Sect. 3.1 or 3.3, respectively; the modiﬁcations
due the presence of spinor ﬁelds are explained in Sect. 5.1.1 – it is to a far extent
obvious how to generalize them from a model containing solely spinor ﬁelds to
QED. The Fermi statistics of the ghost ﬁelds is irrelevant for the R- and T -products
of interest, since in QED the arguments of these products contain ghost ﬁelds in
at most one factor, see (5.1.81).
In addition to the system of axioms explained in Sect. 5.1.1, we require the
following renormalization conditions for QED:
• The relevant MWI for QED (5.2.7) (“QED-MWI”) – formulated and proved
in Sect. 5.2,
• the nearly obvious condition (5.1.81) that ghost ﬁelds behave as classical
ﬁelds.
• The Field parity axiom (3.1.30) is replaced by corresponding requirements
for each kind of ﬁelds; namely, Field parity with respect to the photon ﬁeld,
Charge number conservation – a condition which deals with [the number of
ψ] minus [the number of ψ] – and an analogous condition for the ghost ﬁelds.
The latter is irrelevant for QED, since ghost ﬁelds do not couple, see (5.1.81).
Field parity with respect to the photon ﬁeld is the requirement
αA ◦Tn = Tn ◦α ⊗n
A
,
where
αA F(Aμ, ψ, ψ, u, ˜u) := F(−Aμ, ψ, ψ, u, ˜u)
(5.1.98)
for all F ≡F(Aμ, ψ, ψ, u, ˜u) ∈FQED. Analogously to (3.1.34), an equivalent
formulation of this renormalization condition can be given in terms of the
VEV of the T -product.
To formulate Charge number conservation we introduce the charge num-
ber operator:
θ:

FQED −→FQED
θF :=

dx

δrF
δψ(x) ∧ψ(x) −ψ(x) ∧

(5.1.99)
which we already introduced – in modiﬁed form – for the complex scalar ﬁeld
in Exer. 4.2.6. Note that the integral in (5.1.99) exists, since the FQED-valued
distributions

is an eigenvector of θ with eigenvalue
charge number = (n −l) −l = [number of ψ] −[number of ψ] ;
cf. the relation (1.3.3). One easily veriﬁes that θ satisﬁes the Leibniz rule
with respect to the star product:
θ(F ⋆G) = (θF) ⋆G + F ⋆(θG)
∀F, G ∈FQED .
(5.1.100)
We require Charge number conservation: Since for non-coinciding points the
time-ordered product can be expressed as a multiple ⋆-product (Lemma
3.3.2(a)) and due to (5.1.100), this axiom reads
θ Tn(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗Fn) =
n

j=1
Tn(F1 ⊗· · · ⊗θFj ⊗· · · ⊗Fn) .
(5.1.101)
In Step 1 of the proof of the QED-MWI (Sect. 5.2.2) we show by means of
the causal Wick expansion that it suﬃces to require this condition for the
vacuum expectation value of the T -products (see (5.2.18)), and explain how
this simpliﬁed version of (5.1.101) can be satisﬁed.
• Besides charge number conservation, which concerns only the spinor ﬁelds,
and Field parity with respect to the photon ﬁeld, one traditionally requires
two further discrete symmetries for QED which act nontrivially on both the
spinor and the photon ﬁeld(s): Charge conjugation invariance and PCT -
symmetry. We treat them in the next two sections.
The interaction of QED reads
L(g) := e L(g) := e
	
dx g(x) L(x) ,
L(x) := Aμ(x) ⊗jμ(x) ⊗1 = L(x)∗,
(5.1.102)
where e is the elementary charge, jμ is the current (5.1.27) and g ∈D(M). Com-
paring with (1.5.4), we see that a sign is absorbed in our deﬁnition of e, that is,
−κ = e > 0, which is the electric charge of a positron. We point out that L is
renormalizable by power counting: dim L = 4.
To shorten the notation we will omit the tensor products between the diﬀerent
kinds of ﬁelds and we freely (anti-)commute the factors; e.g., instead of (5.1.102)
we write
L = jμAμ = ψ /Aψ
for the interaction Lagrangian of QED.
Ghost number operator. Finally, in view of the BRST formalism, we introduce
the ghost number operator θu, which is deﬁned analogously to the charge number
operator (5.1.99):
θu :

FQED −→FQED
θuF :=

dx

˜u(x) ∧
δF
δ˜u(x) −u(x) ∧
δF
δu(x)

.
(5.1.103)

382
Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
Every F ∈FQED which is a monomial in u, ˜u, is an eigenvector of θu; the eigenvalue
is called the “ghost number of F” and is denoted by
δ(F) := [number of ˜u in F] −[number of u in F] .
(5.1.104)
If F and G are eigenvectors of θu, then F ∧G and F ⋆G are also eigenvectors of
θu with eigenvalues
δ(F ∧G) = δ(F) + δ(G) ,
δ(F ⋆G) = δ(F) + δ(G) ,
(5.1.105)
as one veriﬁes easily. From u∗= u and ˜u∗= −˜u we see that
δ(F ∗) = δ(F) .
(5.1.106)
We introduce an even-odd grading of FQED with respect to the ghost number:
FQED = Feven
QED ⊕Fodd
QED
where
(−1)δ(F ) =

+1
∀F ∈Feven
QED
−1
∀F ∈Fodd
QED .
(5.1.107)
Note that the Bose–Fermi grading of Fspinor, deﬁned in (5.1.20), can be understood
analogously: It is the splitting of Fspinor into the two subspace spanned by the
eigenvectors of θ whose eigenvalues are even or odd, respectively.
5.1.5
Charge conjugation invariance
Charge conjugation is a transformation that mutually exchanges all particles with
their corresponding antiparticles; hence, it changes the sign of all charges: In QED
this is only the electric charge, but generally these are all charges relevant to any
interaction of the model.
To deﬁne charge conjugation for Dirac spinors we need the charge conjugation
matrix C ∈C4×4, which is invertible and satisﬁes the relation
C−1γμC = −γμT .
(5.1.108)
For simplicity we work here in the Dirac-, Majorana- or Chiral-representation
of the γ-matrices, see, e.g., [109, App. A2]. These representations are unitarily
equivalent to each other, fulﬁll the relation (5.1.3) and the charge conjugation
matrix C has the nice properties155
Cc = C = −CT ,
C−1 = −C .
(5.1.109)
In view of the deﬁnition of charge conjugation as a map βC : FQED −→FQED we
ﬁrst introduce the charge conjugated spinors (cf., e.g., [148, Sect. 4.4])
βCψ(x) := C ψ(x)T = C γ0 T ψc(x) ,
βCψ(x) := ψ(x)T C .
(5.1.110)
155We recall that the upper index “c” denotes complex conjugation.

5.1.
Deformation quantization for fermionic and gauge ﬁelds
383
Proceeding straightforwardly, we obtain
βCψ(x) ≡

βCψ(x)
†γ0 = ψ(x)T γ0T C+γ0 = βCψ(x) ,
β2
Cψ(x) = βC

C ψ(x)T 

βCψ(x)
T = ψ(x)
and
β2
Cψ(x) = βC

ψ(x)T C

=

βCψ(x)
T C = ψ(x) .
In terms of the Dirac equation in relativistic quantum mechanics, charge
conjugation can be understood as follows (cf., e.g., [148, Sect. 1.5]): If (h1, h) ∈
Cphoton × Cspinor,1 (where Cspinor,1 := C∞(M, C4)) is a solution of the Dirac equa-
tion in the presence of the electromagnetic ﬁeld,

(i/∂+ e /A −m)ψ(x)

(h1, h) = 0 ,
(5.1.111)
then (h1, h) solves also the same equation for βCψ in place of ψ and with e replaced
by (−e):

(i/∂−e /A −m)βCψ(x)

(h1, h) = 0 .
This result is obtained straightforwardly by manipulating (5.1.111) as follows:
First we apply complex conjugation, then we multiply with Cγ0 T form the left
and use C γ0 T γμ c = −γμ C γ0 T .
In order that the Dirac equation (5.1.111) is charge conjugation invariant,
i.e., the validity of this equation for (Aμ, ψ) is equivalent to the validity of the
same equation for (βCAμ, βCψ), we deﬁne
βCAμ(x) := −Aμ(x) .
(5.1.112)
Turning to the Faddeev–Popov ghost ﬁelds, the restriction of βC to a single
ghost ﬁeld is deﬁned to be the identity map: βCu(x) := u(x) , βC ˜u(x) := ˜u(x) .
With these preparations, we deﬁne βC : FQED −→FQED by

for F given by (5.1.93). Obviously, βC is linear and has the properties
β2
C = Id
and
βC(FG) = (βCF)(βCG) ;
the latter relation holds also with respect to the star product:
βC(F ⋆G) = (βCF) ⋆(βCG) ,

that is, H12(z) = S+(z) , H21(z) = S−(−z)T , Hμν

vanish.
Let us verify (5.1.117): For a photon contraction, i.e., (r, s) = (3, 3), the relation (5.1.117)
is obvious, due to (5.1.116). The validity of (5.1.117) for the other terms is more involved:
The term (r, s) = (2, 1) of the l.h.s. is equal to the (1, 2)-term of the r.h.s.; this can be
seen as follows. Using (5.1.116), this assertion is equivalent to

This relation holds indeed true, since
CT S+(−z) CT = C (−i/∂z + m) C Δ+(−z) = −(i/∂
T
z + m)Δ+(−z) = S−(z)T .
Analogously, one veriﬁes that the (1, 2)-term of the l.h.s. is equal to the (2, 1)-term of
the r.h.s..]
Motivated by (5.1.114), we require the following additional axiom – for sim-
plicity we work with the T -product:

5.1.
Deformation quantization for fermionic and gauge ﬁelds
385
(xi) Charge conjugation invariance: The axiom reads
βC ◦Tn = Tn ◦β⊗n
C
∀n ∈N∗.
(5.1.118)
Remark 5.1.15. By using the Field parity axiom with respect to the photon ﬁeld
(5.1.98), we can equivalently require that βC ◦αA commutes with Tn. Mathemati-
cally, βC ◦αA is a simpler transformation, since it concerns only the spinor ﬁelds.
But for physics βC is more signiﬁcant: It can be interpreted as charge conjugation
and it is a symmetry of QED, it leaves (the free and the interacting part of) the
Lagrangian of QED invariant.
How to fulﬁll this axiom? Following the inductive Epstein–Glaser construction
of the T -product, we proceed by induction on n. Assuming that all axioms are
satisﬁed for all Tk with k < n, we conclude from (3.3.18) and (5.1.114) that
T 0
n(⊗n
j=1Bj(xj)) ∈D′(Mn \ Δn, FQED) fulﬁlls Charge conjugation invariance.
Hence, the new axiom is indeed a renormalization condition.
Let Tn(. . . ) ∈D′(Mn, FQED) be an extension of T 0
n(. . . ) which satisﬁes all
other axioms. The symmetrized expression
T sym
n
:= 1
2

Tn + βC ◦Tn ◦β⊗n
C

(5.1.119)
is an extension of T 0
n (since βC ◦Tn ◦β⊗n
C
is an extension of βC ◦T 0
n ◦β⊗n
C
= T 0
n)
and obviously it fulﬁlls Charge conjugation invariance.
It remains to show that the other renormalization conditions are preserved
under the symmetrization (5.1.119). Since
δ
δψ ◦βC ̸= βC ◦
δ
δψ , this is non-obvious
for the Field independence. However, by using (5.1.116) we get
δ

Remark 5.1.16 (Furry’s theorem). Let L = jμAμ be the interaction Lagrangian of

is Furry’s Theorem:
t(jμ1, . . . , jμr, L, . . . , L) = 0
if r is odd.

The P CT -Theorem
This section is based on [148, Sect. 4.4] and [62].
In the abbreviation “PCT ”,156 the letter “C” stands for charge conjugation
(introduced in the preceding section), “P” for the parity transformation (or space
reﬂection) (t, ⃗x) −→(t, −⃗x), and “T ” for the time reversal (t, ⃗x) −→(−t, ⃗x). In
QED one can renormalize the T -product such that it is symmetric with respect
to each of these transformations individually; for a proof of this statement in the
framework of causal perturbation theory we refer to [148, Sect. 4.4]. But in weak
interactions neither C, nor P, nor T is a symmetry; this holds only for the com-
position PCT . PCT -symmetry has been proved under very general assumptions;
in particular, it is a consequence of the Wightman axioms [162]. For this reason
we will give a (to a far extent) model independent proof of PCT -symmetry.
156In the literature “CP T” in place of “P CT” is widespread; we prefer the latter abbreviation
to avoid confusion with “Causal Perturbation Theory”.

P - and T -transformation. However, to motivate the (weak) assumptions we will
need for this proof, we ﬁrst deﬁne the P- and T -transformation for QED. Again, to
simplify the formulas, we proceed in the Dirac-, Majorana- or Chiral-representation
of the γ-matrices. Let γ5 ∈C4×4 be the matrix introduced in (5.1.122) and C the
charge conjugation matrix (5.1.108). One veriﬁes straightforwardly the identities
[γ5, γμ]+ = 0 ,
γ5γ5 = 14×4 ,
γ5† = γ5,
γ5γμT γ5 = −γμT ,
C−1γ5C = γ5T
(5.1.123)
as a consequence of the relations (5.1.2)–(5.1.3) and (5.1.108); to obtain the second
last identity we also use γ5T = ±γ5, where the sign depends on the representa-
tion. In this section the relations (5.1.2), (5.1.3) and (5.1.123) for the γ-matrices
and (5.1.108)–(5.1.109) for the charge conjugation matrix C will be used without
referring to them.
The following Deﬁnition can be motivated in terms of the 1-particle theory,
i.e., the Dirac equation in relativistic quantum mechanics, see, e.g., [148, Sect. 1.5].

The P- and T -transformation satisfy the following basic relations.
Lemma 5.1.19 (Algebraic relations of βP and βT ). With θ being the charge num-
ber operator, deﬁned in (5.1.99), and βC the charge conjugation (5.1.113), the
following relations hold true:
(a) βP ◦βP = (−1)θ ,
βT ◦βT = (−1)θ ,
(5.1.128)
(b) βC ◦βP = βP ◦βC ,
βC ◦βT = βT ◦βC ,
βT ◦βP = (−1)θ ◦βP ◦βT ,

βT (F ⋆G) = (βT F) ⋆(βT G)

for all F, G ∈FQED.
Exercise 5.1.20. Prove this lemma, by proceeding in part (c) analogously to the proof of
the corresponding relation for βC (5.1.114).
[Solution: (a) and (b): These identities need to be veriﬁed only on the basic ﬁelds, as
we see from (5.1.125)–(5.1.126). For Aμ(y) and U(z) these veriﬁcations are trivial; so it
remains to prove the assertions158

The ψ-assertions can be traced back to the corresponding relations for ψ by using
(5.1.127), for example,
β2
T ψ(x) = βT

(βT ψ†(x))γ0c
= βT

(βT ψ(x))†
γ0 =

β2
T ψ(x)
†γ0 = −ψ(x) .
Here we use that βT ψ(x) is of the form βT ψ(x) = MT ψ(xT) for some MT ∈C4×4 and,
hence, the relation (5.1.127) implies βT

(βT ψ(x))†
=

β2
T ψ(x)
† due to the antilinearity
of βT .
(c) We proceed by induction on the number of contractions. With that, the proof of the
assertion for βT amounts to the veriﬁcation of

and analogous identities for the ψ-ψ and the A-A contraction. Note that on the right-
hand side we have renamed the integration variables: (x, y) →(xT , yT ). Obviously, the
relation (5.1.115) holds also with βT (or βP ) in place of βC and with that we ﬁnd
δr(βT F)
δψj(xT ) =

analogously to (5.1.116). Due to these equations, the claim (5.1.131) is equivalent to
S+(z)c
?= γ5C S+(zT ) C−1γ5 .
(5.1.132)
We are going to show that the latter identity follows from
S+(z) = (i/∂z + m)Δ+(z)
and
Δ+(z) = Δ+(zP ) ,
Δ+(z)c = Δ+(−z) ,
by treating the terms in (i/∂z + m) individually. For the terms ∼m this is obvious:
Δ+(z)c = Δ+(−z) = Δ+(zT ). For the terms ∼∂z0 we get
−iγc
0 ∂z0Δ+(−z)
?= iγ5Cγ0C−1γ5 (−∂z0)Δ+(zT ) .
This equation holds indeed true, since γ5Cγ0C−1γ5 = −γ5γT
0 γ5 = γT
0 = γc
0. Finally, for
the terms ∼∂zk we have to show
−iγc
k ∂zkΔ+(−z)
?= iγ5CγkC−1γ5 ∂zkΔ+(zT ) .
This identity is veriﬁed as follows: γ5CγkC−1γ5 = −γ5γT
k γ5 = γT
k = −γc
k.
For a ψ-ψ contraction (in place of (5.1.131)) the proof is analogous, the main diﬀerence is
that in (5.1.132) S+(z) is replaced by S−(z) = −(i/∂z+m)Δ+(−z); for an A-A contraction
the veriﬁcation is clearly simpler.
The proof of the corresponding assertion for βP (5.1.130) can be given by walking along
the same lines; the claim (5.1.132) is replaced by
S±(z)
?= γ0 S±(xP ) γ0 ,
which can be veriﬁed by proceeding analogously to above.]

≃(−i),
βT ≃j, β−1

≃(−j), βP βT ≃k, βT βP ≃(−k).
(b) Since βC commutes with βP and βT , it commutes with all elements of G8. Taking
into account additionally that β2
C = Id, we see that C2 := ({Id, βC}, ◦) is an invariant
subgroup of G16. Consequently, G16 = C2 × G8, where “×” means the direct product
of groups. Denoting the elements of G8 by {ga | a = 1, . . . , 8}, the group table can be

because βP , βC are linear and βT is antilinear. We claim that the QED-interaction

β L(x) = L(−x) ,

(5.1.134)
Exercise 5.1.22. Verify the claim (5.1.134).
[Solution: By straightforward calculation we obtain
β Aμ(x) = −Aμ(−x) ,
β ψ(x) = iγ5 ψ†(−x)T ,
β ψ(x) = i ψ(−x)T γ0T γ5 , (5.1.135)
which yields
β jμ(x) = −ψ(−x)Tγ0T γ5γμcγ5ψ†(−x)T = ψ(−x)TγμT γ0T ψ†(−x)T = −jμ(−x)
by using γμc = γμ†T = (γ0γμγ0)T . So we indeed get β L(x) = L(−x) and β L(g) =
(βL)(gc) = L(˜g).]

(5.1.139)
(iii) β commutes with the star product:

(5.1.140)
(iv) The interaction L ∈P is PCT -invariant:
βL(x) = L(−x) .
(5.1.141)

Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
As immediate consequences of (5.1.136) we note that β is antilinear and fulﬁlls
β(FG) = (βF)(βG)
and
ω0(β F) = f c
0 = ω0(F)c = ω0(F ⋆) .
(5.1.142)
As explained above, the assumptions 5.1.23 are satisﬁed for QED. For a real
scalar ﬁeld the PCT -transformation is simply β ϕ(x) = ϕ(−x) and for a complex
scalar ﬁeld it reads β φ(x) = φc(−x).
We require PCT -symmetry of the T -product as an additional axiom: Since
β includes time-reversal, we expect that conjugation of Tn and T n by the PCT -
operator β amounts to mutual exchange of these products, in detail, the condition
reads:
(xii) P CT -symmetry: Let (T n) be the antichronological product which is uniquely
determined by the time-ordered product (Tn), see (3.3.34) or (3.3.37). With
that, the axiom reads
β ◦Tn = T n ◦β⊗n
and
β ◦T n = Tn ◦β⊗n
∀n ∈N .
(5.1.143)
The assumptions 5.1.23 suﬃce to prove PCT -symmetry of the model.
Theorem 5.1.24 (PCT -Theorem).
(a) The axiom PCT -symmetry is a renormalization condition; it can be fulﬁlled
and it is compatible with all other renormalization conditions.

consequence of T1(F) = F = T 1(F) ∀F ∈Floc.

We conclude that the axiom “PCT -symmetry” is indeed a renormalization
condition. To obtain a PCT -covariant renormalization, we take an arbitrary exten-
sion Tn(. . .) ∈D′(Mn, F) of T 0

and symmetrize it with respect to the ﬁnite group generated by β – this is an

One veriﬁes straightforwardly that all other renormalization conditions are
preserved under the symmetrization (5.1.146). For example, for the Sm-expansion

to (5.1.138), we have dim(β−2lAj) = dim Aj = dim(β−2l−1Aj), and with that the
assertion follows from part (0) of Lemma 3.1.26.
Or, the Field independence can be checked by proceeding analogously to
(5.1.120): We use

As a last example, Charge conjugation invariance (5.1.118) is maintained
under the symmetrization (5.1.146), because βC ◦β = β ◦βC (this is a consequence
of part (b) of Lemma 5.1.19) and because βC ◦Tn = Tn◦(βC)⊗n implies βC ◦T n =
T n ◦(βC)⊗n.

Remark 5.1.25 (PCT -transformation applied to interacting ﬁelds). The interact-
ing QFT-ﬁelds R(eF/ℏ
⊗
, G) studied so far are retarded ﬁelds, they have causal sup-
port due to the axiom Causality (3.1.9). We can introduce “advanced” interacting
ﬁelds, by modifying the Bogoliubov formula (3.3.30): We mutually exchange T
with T, that is,

(5.1.150)
By proceeding analogously to Exer. 3.3.11(a), one veriﬁes that the advanced in-
teracting ﬁelds have “anticausal” support:

if

Under the PCT -transformation β retarded and advanced interacting ﬁelds
mutually exchange – this is plausible due to the time reversal. In detail: If the

we obtain

Remark 5.1.26. If both renormalization conditions Charge conjugation invariance
and PCT -symmetry are satisﬁed, the T -product is also PT -symmetric. Namely,
due to β = βP ◦βC ◦βT , β2
C = Id and βC ◦βT = βT ◦βC we have βP ◦βT = β ◦βC
and, hence,
βP ◦βT ◦Tn = T n ◦(βP ◦βT )⊗n
and
βP ◦βT ◦T n = Tn ◦(βP ◦βT )⊗n
∀n ∈N .
In QED one can prove that there exists a renormalization of the T -product
respecting C-, P- and T -symmetry individually and all further renormalization
conditions. This can be done by replacing the symmetrization (5.1.146) by a suit-
able symmetrization with respect to the ﬁnite group G16 studied in Exer. 5.1.21,
see [148, Sect. 4.4].
5.1.7
Reducing the computation of R- and T -products
to scalar ﬁeld renormalization
In this section we explain in terms of a few examples, how the computation of
R- and T -products of QED can be traced back to scalar ﬁeld theory, that is, to
the construction given in Sect. 3.2 (or the corresponding construction for the T -
product, see Sect. 3.3). In particular, the techniques to renormalize explained in
Sect. 3.5 can be applied also to QED. The key for this is formula (A.2.11), which
expresses the spinor ﬁeld propagators in terms of the corresponding propagators
for a real scalar ﬁeld. In addition, an important tool is the following set of formulas
for the trace of products of γ-matrices (see, e.g., [109, App. A2]).
Lemma 5.1.27 (Trace of products of γ-matrices). The trace of an odd product of
γ-matrices vanishes:
tr(γμ1γμ2 · · · γμ2n+1) = 0
∀n ∈N ;
and for the lowest even products it holds that
tr(γμγν) = 4gμν ,
tr(γμγνγργσ) = 4(gμνgρσ −gμρgνσ + gμσgνρ) .

5.1.
Deformation quantization for fermionic and gauge ﬁelds
397
Proof. For even products we use the cyclicity of the trace and the anticommutation
relation of the γ-matrices (5.1.2):
tr(γμγν) = 1
2 tr[γμ, γν]+ = gμν tr(14×4) = 4gμν ,
2 tr(γμγνγργσ) = tr(γμγνγργσ + γνγργσγμ)
= tr

[γμ, γν]+γργσ −γν[γμ, γρ]+γσ + γνγρ[γμ, γσ]+

= 2gμν tr(γργσ) −2gμρ tr(γνγσ) + 2gμσ tr(γνγρ)
= 8(gμνgρσ −gμρgνσ + gμσgνρ) .
The procedure for higher even products is analogous.
To treat the odd products, we use the matrix γ5 deﬁned in (5.1.122), which
fulﬁlls the identities (5.1.123). With the latter, we get
tr(γμ1 · · · γμ2n+1) = tr(γμ1 · · · γμ2n+1γ5γ5) = (−1)2n+1 tr(γ5γμ1 · · · γμ2n+1γ5)
by anticommuting one factor γ5 to the left-hand side. By means of the cyclicity
of the trace, this is equal to
= (−1)2n+1 tr(γ5γ5γμ1 · · · γμ2n+1) = −tr(γμ1 · · · γμ2n+1) .
□
As an illustration we compute here the time-ordered product T2

L(x1) ⊗
L(x2)

(where L = Aμjμ); the retarded product R1,1

L(x1); jμ(x)

is computed
in Exer. 5.2.5. By means of the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24) and the notation
(3.2.20) we obtain
T2

L(x1) ⊗L(x2)

= L(x1) L(x2) + t(Aμ, Aν)(y) jμ(x1)jν(x2)
+ ψ(x1) /A(x1) t(ψ, ψ)(y) /A(x2)ψ(x2) + ψ(x2) /A(x2) t(ψ, ψ)(−y) /A(x1)ψ(x1)
+ ψ(x1)γμ t(Aμψ, Aνψ)(y) γνψ(x2) + ψ(x2)γν t(Aνψ, Aμψ)(−y) γμψ(x1)
+ t(jμ, jν)(y) Aμ(x1)Aν(x2) + t(L, L)(y) ,
y := x1 −x2 .
(5.1.153)
From (5.1.63) and (5.1.89) we know that
t(ψ, ψ)(y) = ℏSF(y)
and
t(Aμ, Aν)(y) = −ℏgμν DF (y) .
(5.1.154)
Similarly to Remk. 3.3.4, the contraction schemes belonging to the various
terms in (5.1.153) can be symbolized by Feyman diagrams, see Figure 5.1. The
wavy lines stand for photon ﬁelds or photon contractions, the non-wavy lines for
spinor ﬁelds or spinor contractions. The latter are oriented, in order to distinguish
between ψ(x) and ψ(x), or SF (y) and SF (−y), respectively; the arrow indicates the
ﬂow of electric charge, its direction is opposite to the order in which the pertinent
term is written (in matrix notation). Charge conservation of L(xj) (j = 1, 2), i.e.,
θL(xj) = 0, is visualized by the fact that in the pertinent vertex there is precisely
one incoming and one outgoing spinor line.

Computation of the vacuum polarization term. We are going to compute
tμν(y) := t(jμ, jν)(y) = tνμ(−y)
which is called the “vacuum polarization tensor”, due to its physical interpretation.
For the latter and also for the physical relevance of the term t(Aμψ, Aνψ) (which
is called “electron self-energy” and is computed in Exer. 5.1.28), we refer to any
book about perturbative QED, e.g., [148]. We put the focus on the peculiarities
of our formalism: Renormalization in x-space – we will use the Sm-expansion and
diﬀerential renormalization – and how to fulﬁll the condition
∂y
μtμν(y) = 0
(5.1.155)
in our framework. The requirement (5.1.155) follows from the QED-MWI, as de-
rived in Exer. 5.2.5; it can also be interpreted as the restriction of tμν coming from
gauge invariance (or BRST invariance) of T2

L(g)⊗2
, see, e.g., [148].

(5.1.156)
where we have inserted the result of Exap. 5.1.4 and the relations (5.1.66)–(5.1.67).
For y /∈V + we have −y /∈V −and, hence, we can apply (5.1.156) in the following
way:
tμν 0(y) = tνμ 0(−y) = −ℏ2 tr

γνSF (−y)γμSF(y)

,
which agrees with the result of (5.1.156) by the cyclicity of the trace. By means
of SF = (i/∂+ m)ΔF and the trace-formulas of Lemma 5.1.27 we obtain
tμν 0(y) = −4ℏ2

t0
2(y) := ΔF (y) ΔF (y) ;
(5.1.157)
the diagram belonging to t0
2 is the ﬁsh diagram (3.2.124).
It remains to compute the extension of t0
1 αβ and t0
2, respectively, from D′(M4\
{0}) to D′(M4); these are scalar ﬁeld renormalization problems, solved by means of
the Sm-expansion and diﬀerential renormalization in Exap. 3.5.4 and Exer. 3.5.6.
The result for t1 αβ is given in (3.5.22) and the relevant Sm-expansion of t2 reads:

∼m0, can be read oﬀfrom u2,1 given in (3.5.13). Inserting these results into

Let us turn to the requirement (5.1.155): Since it is a consequence of the
QED-MWI and since the MWI is a renormalization condition, it must be satisﬁed
for tμν 0. (This is a simple way to check formula (5.1.157), by using □ΔF (y) =
−m2ΔF (y) for y ̸= 0.) Therefore, it holds that
supp ∂μtμν ⊆{0} .
Inserting the Sm-expansion (5.1.159) into this relation, we realize that ∂μuμν
0 (y),
∂μuμν
2 (y) and ∂μrμν
m (y) satisfy this support property individually; hence, we can

400
Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
apply Theorem (A.1.17) to these distributions. Using that ∂μuμν
j (y) (where j =
0, 2) scales almost homogeneously with degree (7−j) and that sd(∂μrμν
m ) = 3, and
taking into account additionally Lorentz covariance, we conclude that
∂μuμν
0 (y) = K0 ∂ν□δ(y) ,
∂μuμν
2 (y) = K2 ∂νδ(y) ,
∂μrμν
m (y) = 0 .
(5.1.162)
The numbers K0, K2 ∈C can explicitly be computed – this is done below. We see
that choosing
C0 + C1 := −K0
and
C2 = −K2 ,
the condition (5.1.155) is fulﬁlled. Since (C0 −C1) is untouched by this condition,
it remains the freedom to add a term

of u0

The relevant Master Ward Identity
for Quantum Electrodynamics
On the one hand this section illustrates the MWI formalism, on the other hand
we derive a crucial tool for the construction of QED.
5.2.1
Formulation of the QED Master Ward Identity
Since the Faddeev–Popov ghost ﬁeld do not couple (see (5.1.81)), we may omit
them here. The free action S0 := Sspinor
0

, given by (5.1.28) and (5.1.83),
is invariant under the global U(1)-transformation
ψ −→ψα := eiαψ ,
ψ −→ψα := e−iαψ ,
Aμ −→Aμ ,
(5.2.1)
where α ∈R. The pertinent conserved Noether current can be computed by means
of (4.2.18), it is the electromagnetic current jμ = ψ ∧γμψ (5.1.27):
∂μjμ(x)



CS0
= 0 .
(5.2.2)
In terms of oﬀ-shell ﬁelds, this current conservation can be written as
∂μjμ(x) = δrS0
δψ(x) ∧Q(x)+Q(x)∧δS0
δψ(x) ,
Q := iψ , Q := Q† γ0 = −iψ , (5.2.3)
by using (5.1.29), in accordance with (4.2.17). Let B be a “monomial” in ψ and ψ,
for simplicity we assume that it does not contain any derivatives of ψ or ψ; more
precisely
B(y) :=

k1,...,kn
Pk1...kn(y) ψk1(y) ∧· · · ∧ψkl(y) ∧ψkl+1(y) ∧· · · ∧ψkn(y) , (5.2.4)
where Pk1...kn is a polynomial in the gauge ﬁeld Aμ. In addition, let
F :=
	
dy g(y) B(y) ∈Floc
QED
with
g ∈D(M) .
To compute the application of the derivation δhQ (4.1.4) to such a local functional
F, we use the deﬁnition of the functional derivatives
δ
δψ and δr
δψ (given in (5.1.14)
and (5.1.33), resp.):

that is, θ is the charge number operator for ﬁeld monomials – we use the same
notation θ as for the charge number operator θ: FQED −→FQED (5.1.99) acting
on functionals. With that we may write θ

dy g(y) B(y) =

dy g(y) (θB)(y).
Setting h(x) = 1 ∀x, the operator δhQ|h=1 : FQED −→FQED agrees with
the charge number operator θ (5.1.99). Note also that we may interpret iθ as the
inﬁnitesimal action of the transformation (5.2.1): iθ B =
d
dα|α=0 Bα where Bα is
obtained from B (5.2.4) by replacing ψ and ψ by ψα and ψα, respectively.
For B1, . . . , Bn being of the form (5.2.4), we obtain the following result for
the MWI belonging to the symmetry A =

dx h(x) ∂μjμ(x), by proceeding anal-
ogously to Exer. 4.2.6:

(5.2.7)
where sgng is the graded signature (introduced in (5.1.45)) and the permuta-
tions are πl : (B1, . . . , Bn) −→(B1, . . .l, . . . , Bn, Bl) and π: (B1, . . . , Bn, ψ) −→
(ψ, B1, . . . , Bn). The signs sgngπl and sgngπ, can easily be derived from the purely
bosonic case by using the η-trick (5.1.48). We call (5.2.7) the “QED-MWI”.
We will prove the QED-MWI for B1, . . . , Bn being arbitrary submonomials
of the interaction L = jμAμ (5.1.102), i.e., for
B1, . . . , Bn ∈{ψ, ψ, Aμ, jμ, ψ /A, /Aψ, L} ;
this suﬃces for our construction of QED.
The equivalent formulation of the QED-MWI in terms of the T -product reads

(5.2.8)
where we use the η-trick, that is, by ˜Bj we mean a bosonic ﬁeld polynomial
which is deﬁned in terms of Bj, which is assumed to be of the form (5.2.4), by
˜Bj(x) := 1 ⊗Bj(x) if Bj is bosonic, or ˜Bj(x) := ηj ⊗Bj(x) if Bj is fermionic,
analogously to (5.1.48).
Taking the VEV of the QED-MWI, the r.h.s. of (5.2.7) or (5.2.8), respectively,
does not contribute – a trivial but useful remark.

5.2.
The relevant Master Ward Identity for Quantum Electrodynamics

A famous example is the Ward identity which connects the “vertex function”
t( /Aψ, ψ /A, L . . . , L, jμ) with the electron self-energy t( /Aψ, ψ /A, L . . . , L): The VEV
of the QED-MWI (5.2.8) with B1 := /Aψ , B2 := ψ /A and B3 := L, . . . , Bn := L
reads
∂y
μt( /Aψ, ψ /A, L, . . . , L, jμ)(x1 −y, x2 −y, x3 −y, . . . , xn −y)

t( /Aψ, ψ /A, L, . . . , L)(x1 −xn, x2 −xn, x3 −xn, . . .) .
Remark 5.2.1 (Derivation of the Ward identity (5.2.9) from gauge invariance of the
S-matrix). Usually the Ward identity (5.2.9) is derived as follows (see, e.g., [148,
Chap. 4.6]) – for simplicity we study the case of lowest order, that is, n = 2 in
(5.2.9). One starts with the condition
∂y
μ T

L(x1) ⊗L(x2) ⊗jμ(y)



CS0
= 0 ,
(5.2.10)
which is motivated by invariance of the on-shell S-matrix in the formal adiabatic
limit with respect to a gauge (or BRST) transformation of the asymptotically free
ﬁelds (see Deﬁnition 5.5.1 for the BRST transformation of the free theory). We
point out that (5.2.10) is the on-shell version of the QED-MWI (5.2.8) for n = 2
and B1 = L = B2, since θL = 0.
After expanding T

L(x1) ⊗L(x2) ⊗jμ(y)

by the causal Wick expansion,
one then selects from (5.2.10) all terms which have precisely one pair (ψ, ψ) and
no further ﬁelds; the following contraction patterns of T

where π ∈S2. Considering the l.h.s. of (5.2.10), the two diagrams in (5.2.11) do
not contribute: For the ﬁrst one this is due to ∂μjμ(y)|CS0 = 0 and for the second
one this follows from ∂y
μ t(jμ, jν)(y −xπ1) = 0 (5.1.155), which is the VEV of
the QED-MWI (5.2.8) for n = 1 and B1 = jν (since θjν = 0) and, when working
without the QED-MWI, can also be motivated by gauge invariance of the S-matrix
in the formal adiabatic limit.

So there remain the contributions of the three diagrams in (5.2.12):
0 =

ψ(x1) ∂y
μt( /Aψ, ψ /A, jμ)(x1 −y, x2 −y) ψ(x2)

CS0
+ (x1 ↔x2) .
Adding 0 = im SF(x2 −y)ψ(y)−im SF(x2 −y)ψ(y) to the term in the ﬁrst [· · · ]-
bracket and proceeding analogously for the second [· · · ]-bracket, we can insert the
(adjoint) Dirac equation (5.1.29) and the corresponding relation for SF (5.1.65).
Hence, the identity (5.2.13) simpliﬁes to
0 = ψ(x1)
-
∂y
μt( /Aψ, ψ /A, jμ)(x1 −y, x2 −y) −ℏt( /Aψ, ψ /A)(x1 −x2) δ(x2 −y)
+ ℏδ(y −x1) t( /Aψ, ψ /A)(x1 −x2)
.
ψ(x2)



CS0
+ (x1 ↔x2) . (5.2.14)
It follows that the term in [· · · ]-brackets must vanish – this is the particular QED-
MWI (5.2.9) to order n = 2.
We point out: To derive the Ward identity (5.2.9) the procedure in (5.2.9)
is much faster than the derivation given here; because the QED-MWI (5.2.8) is
more general than the identity (5.2.10) (and its generalization to higher orders)
expressing gauge invariance of the S-matrix, since in the QED-MWI B1, . . . , Bn
may be true submonomials of L.
Because the MWI holds always true in classical ﬁeld theory, it is satisﬁed
for the contribution of all (connected) tree diagrams to the QED-MWI (5.2.7) –
see Claim 3.1.28 in Sect. 3.1.7. We illustrate this statement by a particular simple
case of the QED-MWI, in which solely tree diagrams appear:

Proof of the QED-MWI
Essentially we follow [48, App. B].
For technical reasons we work with the time-ordered product and – as in
(5.2.8) and Exer. 5.2.3 – with the bosonic ﬁelds ˜Bj. We use the axiom “Scaling
degree” instead of “Sm-expansion”. Proceeding by induction on the order in the
ﬁelds ˜Bj, we assume that the QED-MWI is satisﬁed to lower orders k < n. With

(5.2.16)
We will show that Δ( ˜B1(x1), . . . , ˜Bn(xn); y) can be removed by ﬁnite renormal-
izations of the T -product which maintain the other renormalization conditions.
Step 1: Charge number conservation. Let Bj be of the form (5.2.4) with rj factors
ψ and sj factors ψ, i.e., θBj = (rj −sj) Bj.
In this ﬁrst step we will prove that we can easily satisfy Charge number

j=1(rj −sj) = 0, that is,
t(B1, . . . , Bn) = 0

(rj −sj) ̸= 0 .
(5.2.18)
By means of (5.1.100), one easily veriﬁes that in the inductive construction of the
T -product (see Sect. 3.3), the property (5.2.18) can get lost only in the extension
to the thin diagonal, i.e., (5.2.18) is a renormalization condition. To fulﬁll it, we
simply extend zero by zero – this is compatible with all other renormalization
conditions.
We are now going to show that (5.2.18) is also suﬃcient for (5.2.17). We use
the causal Wick expansion:
T

Bl⊆Bl
t(B1, . . . , Bn)(x1−xn, . . . ) B1(x1)∧· · ·∧Bn(xn) .
Let rj and rj be the number of factors ψ appearing in Bj and Bj, respectively,
and let sj and sj be deﬁned analogously. Obviously it holds that
rj + rj = rj ,
sj + sj = sj .

From (5.2.18) we know that all non-vanishing terms fulﬁll 
j(rj −sj) = 0. Using
these relations we obtain

which yields the assertion (5.2.17). In the following we assume that (5.2.17) holds
true.
Remark 5.2.4. Comparing (5.2.18) with (3.1.34) we see why Charge number con-
servation corresponds to the Field parity axiom. Namely, for the unrenormalized
R- or T -product, given by formulas (3.1.69) or (3.3.10), respectively, both require-
ments are automatically satisﬁed for the same reason: ω0

vanishes, if it is not possible to contract all basic ﬁelds appearing in B1, . . . , Bn.

Now we decompose ∂μg = aμ −bμ such that supp aμ ∩(O+V −) = ∅and supp bμ ∩
(O + V +) = ∅. By causal factorization of the T -product, the ﬁrst term on the

due to spacelike commutativity (Lemma 2.4.1). Hence, we may choose for aμ
a smooth approximation to −δμ0 δ(x0 −c), where c ∈R is a suﬃciently large
constant:
aμ(x) = −δμ0 h(x0)
with
	
dx0 h(x0) = 1 ,
h ∈D([c −ε, c + ε])

Step 3: Structure of the anomalous term. From Theorem 4.3.1 we know that the

(5.2.23)
Here we have used that there is no true submonomial of Q = iψ (or of Q†γ0 = −iψ)
contributing to the causal Wick expansion; because the only submonomial of such
a kind is the constant ﬁeld Q(y) = c = constant, and because Δ(. . . ; c) = 0 (4.3.7)
due to the Oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation axiom.

5.2.
The relevant Master Ward Identity for Quantum Electrodynamics
411
A further consequence of the latter axiom is worked out in Exer. 4.3.3; this
result holds also in QED. Therefore, on the r.h.s. of (5.2.22) the sum is restricted
to submonomials Bl of Bl which are at least bilinear in the basic ﬁelds for all l.
Summing up we conclude: To prove the QED-MWI (5.2.8) for all B1, . . . , Bn
⊆L, we only have to ﬁnd admissible ﬁnite renormalizations which remove the
VEVs d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn) (5.2.23) for all B1, . . . , Bn ∈{jμ, ψ /A, /Aψ, L}.
By Locality of the anomaly map Δ (4.3.4), the distributions d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn)
are of the form
d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn)(x1 −y, . . . , xn −y) =

a
Ca(B1, . . . , Bn) ∂aδ(x1 −y, . . . , xn −y)
(5.2.24)
with coeﬃcients Ca(B1, . . . , Bn) ∈C. Now, for the vacuum expectation values the
restriction to CS0 in (5.2.19) is irrelevant, hence we know that
	
dy d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn)(x1 −y, . . . , xn −y) = 0 .
By means of Lemma 4.5.1 we conclude that the sum over a in (5.2.24) is restricted
to |a| ≥1. On the other hand, from (4.3.6) we have also an upper bound on |a|.
Summing up, the sum is restricted to
1 ≤|a| ≤
n

j=1
dim Bj + 4 −4n =: ω(B1, . . . , Bn) .
(5.2.25)
To be precise, formula (4.3.6) holds only for scalar ﬁelds: In general the term d+2
2
is replaced by dim δS0
δφ , where φ is the relevant basic ﬁeld. For the QED-MWI we
have dim Q = 3
2 = dim Q†γ0 and dim δS0
δψ = 5
2 = dim δS0
δψ .
From Theorem 4.3.1 we know that d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn) is Lorentz covariant and
respects the ∗-structure:
d( ˜B∗
1, . . . , ˜B∗
n)(x1 −y, . . ., xn −y) = d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn)(x1 −y, . . . , xn −y)c , (5.2.26)
where the upper index c denotes complex conjugation. This can be seen also di-
rectly from (5.2.16) – or, for the ∗-structure it is simpler to argue with the corres-
ponding formula for the R-product (instead of the T -product).
Step 4: Removing the anomalous term by ﬁnite renormalizations. In detail, Lem-
ma 4.5.1 states that we can write d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn) as
d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn)(x1−y, . . . , xn−y) = ∂y
μuμ( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn)(x1−y, . . ., xn−y) (5.2.27)
where uμ( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn) is of the form
uμ( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn)(x1 −y, . . . ) =

|a|≤ω(B1,...,Bn)−1
˜Ca(B1, . . . , Bn) ∂aδ(x1 −y, . . .)
(5.2.28)

412
Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
and the upper bound (5.2.25) is also taken into account. Obviously, uμ( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn)
can be chosen such that it is Lorentz covariant. With all that, the replacement
t( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn, jμ) →t( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn, jμ) + ℏn
in uμ( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn)
(5.2.29)
removes the anomalous term d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn), as we see from (5.2.16). Under this
replacement nearly all axioms for the T -product remain satisﬁed, in particular
Causality and the Scaling degree condition
sd t( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn, jμ) ≤
n

j=1
dim Bj + dim jμ = ω(B1, . . . , Bn) −1 + 4n ;
the latter is due to the upper bound on |a| in (5.2.28). But (5.2.29) is only
an admissible ﬁnite renormalization if uμ( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn) has the same symmetries
as required for t( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn, jμ). Especially if there are factors jμl(xl) among
B1(x1), . . . , Bn(xn) the permutation symmetry with respect to (y, μ) ↔(xl, μl)
must be maintained (for all l). There is a prominent counterexample where this is
impossible: In axial QED, introduced in Exer. 5.1.17, the Ward identity
∂y
μ t(jμ1
a , jμ2
a , jμ
a )(x1 −y, x2 −y)
?= 0
(5.2.30)
is part of the relevant MWI (i.e., the MWI corresponding to the QED-MWI),
where, for simplicity, we consider the case of massless spinor ﬁelds: m = 0. The
condition (5.2.30) cannot be fulﬁlled by any admissible ﬁnite renormalization,
because such a renormalization must maintain the invariance under permutations
of (x1, μ1), (x2, μ2) and (y, μ) – this is the “axial anomaly”. We point out that the
latter is an experimentally measurable phenomenon; the theoretical predictions
are in agreement with the experimental results.160
Note that in general uμ( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn) (5.2.27) is not uniquely determined by
d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn). We do not know a general argument (for non-axial QED) that for all
possible anomalous terms d( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn) one can ﬁnd a uμ( ˜B1, . . . , ˜Bn) which has
the wanted symmetries. The famous Ward identity (5.2.9) has only one factor j;
hence, the renormalization (5.2.29) maintains the symmetries in that case. Taking
into account the results of Step 3, and that t(L . . . , L, j, j, j) = 0 (due to Furry’s
160For a treatment of the axial anomaly in the framework of causal perturbation theory and its
application to the decay of the neutral π0-meson into two photons, see, e.g., [148, Sect. 5.3] for
the case m > 0 and [41] for m = 0. To be precise, the π0-decay concerns the case m > 0, and it
is not precisely the anomaly of (5.2.30) which yields this decay rate; the latter is obtained from
the somewhat diﬀerent anomaly
aμ1μ2(x1 −y, x2 −y) := ∂y
μ t(jμ1, jμ2, jμ
a )(x1 −y, x2 −y) −2m t(jμ1, jμ2, jπ)(x1 −y, x2 −y) ,
(5.2.31)
where jμ is the usual electromagnetic current (5.1.27) and jπ(y) := i ψ(x)∧γ5ψ(x). The anomaly
(5.2.31) is also called “axial anomaly” and one can show that it is related to the anomaly of
(5.2.30) by: aμ1μ2 = 3· [anomaly of (5.2.30)].

of the anomalous QED-MWI (5.2.16). Due to (5.2.26) and the factor (−i)n ap-
pearing on the l.h.s. of (5.2.16), the coeﬃcients C...
ra, r = 1, 2, of the anomalous
term are elements of in R; in addition they are restricted by Lorentz covariance and
the permutation symmetry in x11, . . . , x1m. A further restriction can be obtained
from the symmetry in the factors j of the terms on the l.h.s., e.g.,
∂x2
ν ∂y
μt(L . . . , L, jν, jμ)(x11 −y, . . . , x1m −y, x2 −y)

By working this out one proves that in both cases (5.2.32) and (5.2.33) one can
ﬁnd a uμ(. . . ) (5.2.27)–(5.2.28) such that the renormalization (5.2.29) preserves
the symmetries of t(L . . . , L, jν, jμ) and t(L . . . , L, jν1, jν2, jν3, jμ), respectively,
see, e.g., [42].

The local algebras of interacting ﬁelds
The reference for this section is [48].
We are going to derive algebraic properties of the interacting ﬁelds BL(g)(x),
where B = Aμ, ψ, ψ, jμ, . . . and L(g) ∈Floc
QED is the QED-interaction (5.1.102).
Mostly, we will study the corresponding on-shell ﬁelds BL(g)(x)0 := BL(g)(x)|CS0 .
∗-operation and ﬁeld equations. In order that L(g)∗= L(g), we assume that g is
real-valued. Then, the ∗-structure axiom implies the relations
Aμ
L(g)(x)∗= Aμ
L(g)(x) ,
jμ
L(g)(x)∗= jμ
L(g)(x),
ψL(g)(x)∗γ0 = ψL(g)(x) ,
by remembering that ψ(x)∗:= ψ†(x).
The oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation axiom yields the following on-shell ﬁeld equations:
the interacting Maxwell equation, the interacting Dirac equation and its adjoint,
that is,
□xAμ
L(g)(x)0 = −g(x)e jμ
L(g)(x)0,
(i/∂x −m)ψL(g)(x)0 = −g(x)e ( /Aψ)L(g)(x)0 ,
i∂μ
xψL(g)(x)0γμ + mψL(g)(x)0 = g(x)e (ψ /A)L(g)(x)0 .
(5.3.1)
In contrast to the conservation of the interacting current, given in (5.2.34), these
ﬁeld equations contain a trace of the adiabatic switching of the interaction: The
elementary charge e is multiplied by g(x).

5.3.
The local algebras of interacting ﬁelds
417
This factor g(x) is replaced by 1 in the algebraic adiabatic limit (introduced
in Sect. 3.7): Let O be an open double cone and let g ∈D(M) with
g(x) = 1
∀x in a neighbourhood of O.
(5.3.2)
The algebra of interacting on-shell ﬁelds localized in O is deﬁned by
˜F0(O) :=
3
⋆{ BL(g)(f)0


 f ∈D(O), B = Aμ, ψ, ψ, ∂μAμ, F μν, jμ, L, . . . } ,
(5.3.3)
where BL(g)(f) :=

d4x BL(g)(x)f(x) , F μν := ∂μAν −∂νAμ and 4
⋆means
the algebra, under the ⋆-product, generated by the elements of the indicated set.
Moreover, the lower index “0” denotes restriction to CS0. In agreement with the
notations used later on in Sect. 5.4.3, we write ˜F0(O) instead of F0(O) – the tilde
means “interacting”.
The algebraic adiabatic limit can be summarized as follows: Due to Theorem
3.7.1, the algebraic relations of ˜F(O)0 are independent of the behaviour of g outside
of O. Since O is arbitrary, the full net of local ﬁeld algebras can be constructed in
this way without performing the adiabatic limit g(x) →1 in the traditional sense
(see Remk. 3.7.3 and App. A.6). And, for x ∈O we have the usual ﬁeld equations,
i.e., without the factor g(x).
From the integrated ﬁeld equation
Aμ
L(g)(x)0 = Aμ(x)0 + e
	
dy Dret(x −y) g(y) jμ
L(g)(y)0
and current conservation (5.2.34) we get
∂x
μAμ
L(g)(x)0 = ∂x
μAμ(x)0 + e
	
dy Dret(x −y) (∂μg)(y) jμ
L(g)(y)0 .
(5.3.4)
Thus, performing formally the limit g(y) →1 ∀y ∈x + V −(“partial adiabatic
limit”), the interacting ﬁeld ∂x
μAμ
L(g)(x)0 agrees with the corresponding free one.
However, note that the algebraic adiabatic limit does not suﬃce for that, even for
x ∈O.
Commutators of interacting ﬁelds. By means of the GLZ relation we can explicitly
compute commutators of interacting ﬁelds BL(g)(f)0 ∈˜F0(O). For these commu-
tators we will use the notions “advanced part” and “retarded part”, introduced
in Remk. 3.1.6. In the following proposition we compute some commutators of
∂x
μAμ
L(g)(x)0 (where x ∈O) with elements of ˜F0(O).

replacing D(x −y) by −Dav(x −y) := −Dret(y −x). The equality of the retarded

we use the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld equation in the form (3.2.61).161 The ﬁrst term on the

δAμ(z) = gμν δ(y−

Due to the causal support of the R-product and supp Dav ⊆V −, the z-integration

therefore we may replace g(z) by 1.

using □zD(z) = 0.
161Comparing the two point function of the photon ﬁeld (5.1.89) with the corresponding formula
for the real scalar ﬁeld (A.2.6), we see that there is an additional global factor (−1) on the r.h.s. of
(3.2.61) when this formula is applied to R(· · · ⊗Aμ(x); · · · ).

(d): This relation follows by applying the ∗-operation to the relation (c). Or,
in a direct proof along the lines of the proof of (c), there is an additional minus

Connection of observable algebras and ﬁeld algebras
We continue to follow [48].
The construction given in this section is not restricted to QED; it uses some
assumptions and applies to all perturbative gauge or massive vector boson theories
satisfying these assumptions. The latter are veriﬁed for QED in Sect. 5.5.
5.4.1
Local construction of observables in gauge theories
In gauge theories the local algebras F0(O) of on-shell ﬁelds – for QED these are
the algebras ˜F0(O) introduced in (5.3.3) – contain unphysical ﬁelds like vector

potentials and ghosts. How to select the observables? Using the framework of
AQFT (see Sect. 3.7), this question can be reformulated as follows: How can we
obtain from the net O −→F0(O) the net O −→A(O) of on-shell observables
localized in O? We use the BRST transformation for this; basic references for the
BRST formalism are [7, 8, 96, 164].162
A short outline of BRST symmetry. (Cf., e.g., [58].) The BRST quantization is
based on earlier work of Feynman [72], Faddeev and Popov [69], and of Slavnov.
The basic idea is that after adding the “gauge ﬁxing term” (5.1.85) to the action,
which makes the Cauchy problem well posed but which is not gauge invariant, one
enlarges the number of ﬁelds by the ghosts u and the anti-ghosts ˜u. This amounts
to adding a further term to the action: The “ghost action” Sghost. In non-Abelian
gauge theories, the latter contains, besides the free part Sghost
0
(5.1.77), a coupling
of u and ˜u to the gauge ﬁeld. The purpose of this enlargements is that the total
action (i.e., the original action plus the gauge ﬁxing term plus the ghost action)
is invariant under the BRST transformation s, which has the following crucial
properties:
• On the gauge ﬁelds and the fermionic matter ﬁelds, s acts as an inﬁnitesimal
gauge transformation (cf. (5.5.53)); hence, BRST invariance can be inter-
preted as a generalization of gauge invariance to models containing ghost
ﬁelds, which overcomes the problem that the gauge ﬁxing term is not gauge
invariant.
• If the ﬁeld equations hold true (in our formalism we ensure this by restricting
all functionals to CS0), the BRST transformation is nilpotent:163 s2 F0 =
0 ∀F0 ∈F0(O). This opens the door for the application of cohomological
methods.
We illustrate these statements for the free photon ﬁeld. We proceed in an intuitive
way, a rigorous deﬁnition of the BRST transformation s for free and interacting
QED is given in Sect. 5.5. For the photon ﬁeld, s is deﬁned by
s(Aμ)(x) := i ∂
∂α



α=0(Aμ + α∂μu)(x) = i∂μu(x) ,
where u is the ghost ﬁeld. The free action Sphoton
0
(5.1.83) is BRST-invariant,
s Sphoton
0
= 0, because Aμ −→−i sAμ can formally be understood as an inﬁnites-
imal gauge transformation. The gauge ﬁxing term Sgf
0
(5.1.85) is neither gauge-
162The name “BRST” stands for Becchi, Rouet, Stora (the authors of the ﬁrst two references)
and for Tyutin (the author of the last reference, which is unfortunately unpublished).
163By introducing an additional, auxiliary ﬁeld, the “Nakanishi–Lautrup ﬁeld” [121, 128], which
is a real scalar ﬁeld, one can reach that the BRST transformation is nilpotent for the oﬀ-shell
ﬁelds, i.e., without using any ﬁeld equation.

To give a corresponding deﬁnition of the BRST transformation of the free ghost
action (5.1.77), we adopt (from the second last expression of (5.4.1)) that s is a
derivation with respect to the classical product and commutes with partial deriva-
tives; in addition, the BRST transformation of the basic ghost ﬁelds u and ˜u must
be deﬁned such that s(Sghost
0
) = −s(Sgf
0 ). This can be achieved by setting
s(u)(x) := 0 ,
s(˜u)(x) := −iλ ∂μAμ(x) .
Namely, with these deﬁnitions we obtain164

Finally, we check nilpotency of s on the basic ﬁelds:

s2(u) = s(0) = 0 ,
s2(˜u)(x)


CS0 = −iλ∂μs(Aμ)(x)


CS0 = λ □u(x)


CS0 = 0 .

a crucial diﬀerence between “gauge symmetry” and “BRST symmetry” is the
164When applied to ghost ﬁelds, the Leibniz rule for s is modiﬁed by a sign (which is irrelevant
here since s(u) = 0), i.e., s is a graded derivation, analogously to (5.4.3) below. Otherwise it
would, e.g., not hold that s(0) = 0, as we see from the following calculation:
s(0) = s

Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
following: In contrast to gauge invariance, which is “spontaneously” broken, BRST
invariance holds exactly. More precisely, the total action of such a model – which
contains for each massive vector boson ﬁeld Aμ a corresponding “St¨uckelberg ﬁeld”
(which is a bosonic, real, scalar ghost ﬁeld) and a corresponding pair (u, ˜u) of
Faddeev–Popov ghost ﬁelds, and which contains at least one Higgs ﬁeld166 (which
is an observable, real scalar ﬁeld) and possibly spinor ﬁelds – this action is BRST-
invariant. (For an explicit veriﬁcation of this well-known statement for the most
simple model, see, e.g., [65, Sect. 3].)
Selection of the observables. Returning to the problem of selecting the observ-
ables, we make the following assumptions: Let O −→F0(O) be the net of local
on-shell ﬁeld algebras of a gauge model (for QED we mean the net O −→˜F0(O)
introduced in (5.3.3)); the relevant product is the star-product and we will al-
ways work on-shell. To simplify the notation, we will omit the lower index “ 0” of
F0 ∈F0(O). Each F0(O) is a ∗-algebra and is even-odd graded with respect to the
ghost number; for QED this grading is given in (5.1.107). In addition, we assume
that the BRST transformation167
s : F0 −→F0 ,
F0 := ∪OF0(O) ,
is given and has the following properties:
• s is a graded derivation with respect to the ⋆-product, i.e., it is linear and
satisﬁes the relation168
s(F ⋆G) = s(F) ⋆G + (−1)δ(F ) F ⋆s(G) ;
(5.4.3)
• moreover, s lowers the ghost number by 1 and is nilpotent,
δ

s(F)

= δ(F) −1
and
s2 = 0 ;
(5.4.4)
• in addition, s commutes with the ∗-operation up to the following sign:
s(F ∗) = −(−1)δ(F ) s(F)∗;
(5.4.5)
• and ﬁnally s preserves the localization region,
s

F0(O)

⊆F0(O) .
(5.4.6)
166There is an exception: Massive QED does not need any Higgs ﬁeld.
167More precisely, by F0 := ∪OF0(O) we mean the inductive limit of the algebras F0(O), intro-
duced in (3.7.19). Due to (5.4.6), the BRST transformation on F0 is deﬁned by
s
	(F, O)
:=
s(F ), O
∀(F, O) ∈F0 .
168When writing δ(F ) we implicitly assume that F is an eigenvector of the ghost number operator
θu (5.1.103); that is, the relations (5.4.3)–(5.4.5) are assumed for all F, G ∈F0 where F is such
an eigenvector.

5.4.
Connection of observable algebras and ﬁeld algebras
423
To select the observables, we take into account that they should be s-invariant.
Therefore, we consider the kernel of s,
A0 := s−1(0) ⊂F0 ,
and
A0(O) := A0 ∩F0(O) .
A0 is a ∗-algebra, because
F, G ∈A0
implies
s(F ⋆G) = s(F) ⋆G + (−1)δ(F )F ⋆s(G) = 0
and s(F ∗) = 0 , i.e., F ⋆G ∈A0 and F ∗∈A0. We set
A00 := s(F0)
and
A00(O) := A00 ∩F0(O) .
Because of s2 = 0, the space A00 is a subspace of A0; it is even a 2-sided ideal in
A0, which means that the relations
A00 ⋆A0 ⊆A00
and
A0 ⋆A00 ⊆A00
(5.4.7)
hold true. Indeed, for F ∈F0 and G ∈A0 we get
s(F) ⋆G = s(F ⋆G) −(−1)δ(F ) F ⋆s(G) = s(F ⋆G) ∈A00 ,
and similarly we verify G ⋆s(F) ∈A00.
Because of these facts, the quotient
A := A0
A00 ≡{[F] := F + A00 

 F ∈A0}
(5.4.8)
with the induced product,
[F] ⋆[G] := [F ⋆G]
for
F, G ∈A0 ,
is a well-deﬁned algebra; we interpret it as the “algebra of observables”. Due to
(5.4.5) it holds that
A0∗= A0 ,
A00∗= A00
and, hence,
[F]∗= F ∗+ A00 = [F ∗] ,
A∗= A ,
(5.4.9)
that is, A is also a ∗-algebra. In addition,
O →A(O) := A0(O)
A00(O)
(5.4.10)
is the net of algebras of local observables.
So, on the level of observables, we identify any two s-invariant ﬁelds which dif-
fer by a ﬁeld in the range of s. For example, for g ∈D(M) we have Aμ(∂μg) ∈Ker s;
however, it is well known (e.g., from Gupta–Bleuler quantization) that [Aμ(∂μg)]
is a trivial observable, it should be identiﬁed with the observable [F] = 0. This
happens indeed, since Aμ(∂μg) =
1
iλ s(˜u)(g) ∈Ran s.

5.4.2
Construction of physical states on the algebra of observables
The positivity problem in the quantization of gauge ﬁelds. We aim to construct
physical states on the algebra A of observables in terms of vector states given
by a (pre) Hilbert space representation, as introduced in (2.5.4). Hence, we are
searching a nontrivial representation π of A by linear operators on a pre Hilbert
space169 H, such that

The “positivity problem” in the quantization of spin 1 gauge ﬁelds is the
following: The ﬁeld algebra F0 cannot be nontrivially represented on a pre Hilbert
space such that the relation (5.4.11) holds true. We explain this for the represen-
tation Φ of the free photon ﬁeld (restricted to CS0) in the pertinent Fock space
F := Fphoton, see Theorem 2.6.3. Let Ω be the Fock vacuum and ⟨· , · ⟩F the scalar
product. Taking into account Aμ(x)∗= Aμ(x), we assume that170

where we do not sum over μ. Due to positivity of the Wightman two-point function,
⟨g, D+g⟩≥0 ∀g ∈D(M) (2.2.10), we obtain a contradiction for μ = 0. Therefore,
for a representation of the ﬁeld algebra we have to give up the relation (5.4.11) or
the positive deﬁniteness of the scalar product. We will do the latter.
Representation of the ﬁeld algebra on an inner product space. To use the Kugo–
Ojima formalism [118] we make the following assumptions: Let a faithful repre-
sentation ρ of (F0, ⋆) on an inner product171 space (K, ⟨· , ·⟩) be given such that

(5.4.12)
169A “pre Hilbert space” is a generalization of a Hilbert space: It does not need to be complete
with respect to the norm given by the scalar product. The completion of a pre Hilbert space
(with respect to the mentioned norm) is a Hilbert space.
170In the remaining sections we return to the standard notation “ z ” for the complex conjugated
number of z ∈C.
171That (K, ⟨· , ·⟩) is an “inner product space” means that K is a vector space and that the
“inner product” ⟨· , ·⟩: K × K −→C is bilinear and satisﬁes ⟨w, v⟩= ⟨v, w⟩for all v, w ∈K –
but, in contrast to a scalar product, an inner product needs not to be positive deﬁnite.

To simplify the notation we will frequently write F for ρ(F) and the product of
operators on K is denoted by ρ(F) ρ(G), so we have ρ(F ⋆G) = ρ(F) ρ(G). In addi-
tion, let an operator Q on K be given which implements the BRST transformation
s, i.e.,

and
Q2 ≡Q Q = 0 .

Note that if the inner product on K would be positive deﬁnite, we would ﬁnd
⟨Qv, Qv⟩= ⟨v, Q2v⟩= 0 for all v ∈K, hence Q = 0 and thus also s = 0. Hence
for nontrivial s the inner product must necessarily be indeﬁnite.
Since the physical states should be s-invariant, we consider the kernel of Q:
K0 := Ker Q. Let K00 be the range of Q. Because of Q2 = 0 we have K00 ⊆K0.

Stability under deformations
For a free spin 1 gauge model, the assumptions made in the previous sections are
satisﬁed; for the free theory underlying QED we will verify this in Sect. 5.5.1.
What happens when we turn on the interaction? We will show that, with reason-
able assumptions, the described structure is stable under such a deformation. The
deformation parameter is the coupling constant κ. Similarly to Sects. 2.5–2.6 we
assume that the ﬁelds are polynomials in ℏ, where ℏ> 0 is a ﬁxed parameter.
Let O −→F0(O) be the net of local on-shell ﬁeld algebras of the free theory.
In addition let ρ be a ﬁxed representation of (F0, ⋆) (where F0 := ∪OF0(O)) on
an inner product space (K, ⟨· , ⟩) fulﬁlling the assumptions made in the previ-
ous section. To simplify the notation, we omit to write ρ. Now, we replace every
generator F of F0(O) by a formal power series
˜F =
∞

n=0
κnF(n)
with
F(0) := F , F(n) ∈F0 , δ(F(n)) = δ(F) ∀n .
(5.4.20)
For our construction of QED, we have κ = −e, the set of generators is
{ B(f)0


 f ∈D(O), B = Aμ, ψ, ψ, u, ˜u, ∂μAμ, F μν, jμ, L, . . . }
and

B(f)0 =

B(f)eL(g)

0 ≡R

eeL(g)
⊗
, B(f)

0 ;
(5.4.21)
note that L(g) and B(f), appearing in the argument of the R-product, are oﬀ-shell
ﬁelds. Under the star product the set of power series ˜F (5.4.20) (obtained from the
generators of F0(O)) generates a ∗-algebra, which we denote by ˜F0(O) – for QED
˜F0(O) is given by (5.3.3). In addition, let ˜F0 := ∪O˜F0(O), where again Footn. 167
applies.
In the same way we assume that the free BRST transformation s : F0 −→F0
and the pertinent free BRST charge Q (5.4.13) are replaced by formal power
series ˜s and ˜Q, respectively, and that ˜s and ˜Q satisfy the assumptions made in the
previous sections. In detail, we assume
˜s =

Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
In addition we assume that the following relations hold true:
˜s2 = 0 ,
˜Q2 = 0,
˜s( ˜F ) = ˜Q ˜F −(−1)δ( ˜
F ) ˜F ˜Q
and
⟨˜Q˜v, ˜w⟩= ⟨˜v, ˜Q ˜w⟩
(5.4.22)
for all ˜v, ˜w ∈˜K.
We can then deﬁne the (local) algebra of observables of the interacting model:
˜A := Ker ˜s
Ran ˜s
and
˜A(O) := Ker ˜s ∩˜F0(O)
Ran ˜s ∩˜F0(O)
.
K0 and K00 are replaced by spaces of formal power series with coeﬃcients in K:
˜K0 := Ker ˜Q
and
˜K00 := Ran ˜Q .
Due to Lemma 5.4.3, the algebra ˜A has a natural representation on
˜H :=
˜K0
˜K00 .
(5.4.23)
The inner product on K induces an inner product on ˜H which assumes values in
C[[κ]]: For ˜v = 
n κnvn ∈˜K0 and ˜w = 
n κnwn ∈˜K0 it is deﬁned by
⟨˜v + ˜K00, ˜w + ˜K00⟩˜
H := ⟨˜v, ˜w⟩˜K =

n,j
κn+j⟨vn, wj⟩K ∈C[[κ]] .
To discuss positivity of this inner product, we work with the following deﬁnition,
which is used also in [157]:
Deﬁnition 5.4.4 (Positivity of formal power series). A formal power series ˜b =

n κnbn ∈C[[κ]] is called positive – we write ˜b ≥0 – if and only if there exists
another formal power series ˜c ∈C[[κ]] such that172 ˜b = ˜c ˜c.
An immediate consequence of this Deﬁnition is that, for ˜a, ˜b ∈C[[κ]] with
˜a ≥0 and ˜b ≥0, it holds that ˜a˜b ≥0. It also holds that ˜a + ˜b ≥0; this follows
from the following exercise.
Exercise 5.4.5. Prove that ˜b = 
n κnbn ≥0 (where bn ∈C for all n) is equivalent to the
condition
bn ∈R ,
∀n ∈N,
and
∃k ∈N ∪{∞}
such that
bl = 0
∀l < 2k and, if k < ∞, b2k > 0 .
(5.4.24)
[Solution: (i) (5.4.24) is necessary for ˜b ≥0: Let ˜b = ˜c ˜c where ˜c = (0, . . . , 0, ck, . . .) with
ck ̸= 0 for some k ∈N. From
bn =
n

j=0
cj cn−j
we see that bn ∈R ∀n ∈N and that ˜b = (0, . . . , 0, b2k = ckck, . . .) with b2k > 0.
172For ˜c = 
n cn κn ∈C[[κ]] the deﬁnition (A.1.2) says that ˜c := 
n cn κn .

5.4.

(ii) (5.4.24) is suﬃcient for ˜b ≥0: Let ˜b = (0, . . . , 0, b2k, . . .) be given with b2k > 0 and
bn ∈R ∀n ∈N. There exists a unique real solution ˜c ∈R[[κ]] of the equation ˜b = ˜c ˜c.
Namely, making the ansatz ˜c = (0, . . . , 0, cl, cl+1, . . .) we get
˜c2 =

0, . . . , 0, c2
l , 2clcl+1, . . . , 2clcl+j +

We conclude:

.
If we admit complex solutions ˜c ∈C[[κ]] of ˜b = ˜c ˜c, then ˜c is non-unique.]
In the following exercise, which is taken from [38, Lemma 4.2.2], we generalize
the deﬁnition of a state (Deﬁnition 2.5.1) to formal power series in κ, that is, from
(Fℏ, ⋆) to (Fℏ[[κ]], ⋆), where Fℏis deﬁned in (2.1.6) and Fℏ[[κ]] ∋1 = (1, 0, 0, 0, . . .).
Exercise 5.4.6. For the model of a real scalar ﬁeld, the map
ω0 :

(Fℏ[[κ]], ⋆) −→C[[κ]]
F = ∞
n=0 Fn κn −→∞
n=0 ω0(Fn) κn
where
ω0

f0 +

j≥1
⟨fj, ϕ⊗j⟩
	
:= f0 ,
is a state according to Deﬁnition 2.5.1 – the “vacuum state”, if positivity is understood
in the just introduced sense. The only non-obvious part of this statement is positivity,
that is,
ω0(F ∗⋆F) ≡
∞

n,j=0
κn+j ω0(F ∗
n ⋆Fj) ≥0 .
Prove this relation.
[Hint: To verify that the criterion (5.4.24) is fulﬁlled, use the Fock space representation
(Thm. 2.6.3) and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.]
[Solution: First, the relation
ω0(F ∗⋆F) = ω0

(F ∗⋆F)∗
= ω0(F ∗⋆F)
implies
ω0(F ∗⋆F) ∈R[[κ]] .
Next, let k ∈N ∪{∞} be the smallest number such that ω0(F ∗
k ⋆Fk) ̸= 0. By using
Thm. 2.6.3, the relation (2.6.7) and the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, we obtain
0 ≤|ω0(F ∗
n ⋆Fj)|2 = |⟨Ω | Φ

(F ∗
n ⋆Fj)0

| Ω⟩|2 = |⟨Φ(Fn,0)Ω, Φ(Fj,0)Ω⟩|2
≤∥Φ(Fn,0)Ω∥2 · ∥Φ(Fj,0)Ω∥2 = ω0(F ∗
n ⋆Fn) · ω0(F ∗
j ⋆Fj) ,
where the lower index “0” in the respective argument of Φ denotes restriction to C0.
Hence, it holds that
ω0(F ∗
n ⋆Fj) = 0
if
n < k
or
j < k .
If k = ∞, we get ω0(F ∗⋆F) = 0. In the case k < ∞, we conclude that
ω0(F ∗⋆F) = κ2k ω0(F ∗
k ⋆Fk) + O(κ2k+1) ;
to complete the proof we mention that
0 ̸= ω0(F ∗
k ⋆Fk) = ∥Φ(Fk,0)Ω∥2 ≥0 . ]

Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
Remark 5.4.7 (Weaker deﬁnition of positivity). Bordemann and Waldmann [13]
work with a weaker deﬁnition of positivity in the case of R[[λ]] (or, more generally,
R may be replaced by an ordered ring R): They only require that the smallest
non-vanishing coeﬃcient is positive, it does not need to be an even coeﬃcient.
Mathematically this deﬁnition has several advantages, in particular the ring R[[λ]]
is then ordered as well, that is, each non-vanishing r ∈R[[λ]] is either positive
(r > 0) or negative (−r > 0) [167]. Physically this deﬁnition is well suited for the
deﬁnition of positivity of states on (F[[ℏ]], ⋆) (cf. Deﬁnition 2.5.1); a main reason
for this is that it should hold (0, 1, 0, 0, . . .) > 0, because ℏ> 0. But in the present
framework, the deformation parameter is the coupling constant κ, which may be
negative and, hence, (0, 1, 0, 0, . . .) should not be positive; therefore, we work with
Deﬁnition 5.4.4.
Remark 5.4.8 (Positivity of polynomials). Interpreting a polynomial p : D −→C,
where D ⊂R is an open interval containing x = 0, as a formal power series, i.e.,
p(x) ∈C[[x]], the question arises whether Deﬁnition 5.4.4 agrees with the usual
deﬁnition: p(x) ≥0 ∀x ∈D. The answer is “yes” if D is suﬃciently small. We
verify this statement for two examples:
• A simple example is p1 : (−ε, ε) −→C ; p1(x) = x , ε > 0 arbitrary, which is
neither positive in the usual sense, nor does it fulﬁll the criterion (5.4.24).
• For p2 : D := (−1, 1) −→C ; p2(x) = 1−x the condition (5.4.24) is satisﬁed
and it holds that p2(x) > 0 ∀x ∈D. But for x > 1 we have p2(x) < 0 – this
can be understood as follows: From p(x) = ˜c(x) ˜c(x), where ˜c(x) ∈C[[x]], we
certainly obtain p(x) ≥0 for all x which lie inside the circle of convergence
of the power series ˜c(x); but for x outside this region, p(x) may be negative.
The latter happens for p2; namely, the radius of convergence of the power
series

The following theorem is very useful and gratifying: It states that the assumptions
concerning the positivity of the inner product are automatically fulﬁlled for the
deformed theory, if they hold true in the initial, undeformed model.
Theorem 5.4.9 (Stability under deformations, [48]). Let the positivity assumption
(5.4.15) be fulﬁlled to zeroth order in κ. Then, the following statements about the
deformed theory hold true:173
(i) ⟨˜v, ˜v⟩˜K ≥0
∀˜v ∈˜K0,
(ii)

˜v ∈˜K0 ∧⟨˜v, ˜v⟩˜K = 0

˜v ∈˜K00.

A is denoted by ( ˜

(iii) For every v ∈K0 there exists a power series ˜v ∈˜K0 with (˜v)0 = v.
(iv) Let π and ˜π be the representations (5.4.18) of A, ˜A on H, ˜H, respectively.
Then ˜π([ ˜F]) ̸= 0 if π

[( ˜F)0]

̸= 0 .
Proof. (i) and (ii): Let ˜v = 
n κnvn ∈˜K0 and
bn :=

⟨˜v, ˜v⟩˜K

n =
n

k=0
⟨vk, vn−k⟩K .
Obviously, bn is real. ˜Q˜v = 0 implies Q(0)v0 = 0, hence v0 ∈K0 and b0 ≥0. If
b0 > 0 (i) follows. If b0 = 0 we know that there is some w0 ∈K with v0 = Q(0)w0.
Let w(0)
k
:= w0 δk,0 and ˜w(0) := 
k κkw(0)
k
= w0. Then,
˜η(0) := ˜v −˜Q ˜w(0)
is a formal power series with vanishing term of zeroth order. We now proceed by
induction and assume that b0 = b1 = · · · = b2n = 0 and that there exists some
formal power series ˜w(n) = 
k κkw(n)
k
with coeﬃcients in K such that
˜η(n) ≡

k
κkη(n)
k
:= ˜v −˜Q ˜w(n)
vanishes up to order n: ˜η(n) = (0, . . . , 0, η(n)
n+1, . . .). Note that ˜Q˜η(n) = ˜Q˜v = 0.
Then,
b2n+1 =

⟨˜η(n) + ˜Q ˜w(n), ˜η(n) + ˜Q ˜w(n)⟩˜K

2n+1 =

⟨˜η(n), ˜η(n)⟩˜K

2n+1 = 0
and b2n+2 = ⟨η(n)
n+1, η(n)
n+1⟩K. Since ˜Q˜η(n) = 0 we get Q(0)η(n)
n+1 = 0, i.e., η(n)
n+1 ∈K0;
hence b2n+2 ≥0. If b2n+2 > 0 we obtain (i), otherwise there exists a wn+1 ∈K
with η(n)
n+1 = Q(0)wn+1, and we can deﬁne
w(n+1)
k
:= w(n)
k
+ δn+1,k wn+1 .
Setting ˜w(n+1) := 
k κkw(n+1)
k
, we obtain
η(n+1)
k
:= (˜v −˜Q ˜w(n+1))k =

(˜v −˜Q ˜w(n))k = 0
for 0 ≤k ≤n
(˜v −˜Q ˜w(n))n+1 −Q(0)wn+1 = 0
for k = n + 1 .
Either the induction stops at some n, then (i) is satisﬁed; otherwise, we are pre-
cisely in the case ⟨˜v, ˜v⟩˜K = 0. In the latter case we obtain a
˜w := lim
n→∞˜w(n)
with
˜v = ˜Q ˜w ,
that is, ˜v ∈˜K00.

432
Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
(iii): Again we proceed by induction and assume that there exists a power
series ˜v(n) such that ˜Q˜v(n) vanishes up to order n and (˜v(n))0 = v. This is certainly
true for n = 0. Then 0 = ( ˜Q2˜v(n))n+1 = Q(0)( ˜Q˜v(n))n+1, hence ( ˜Q˜v(n))n+1 ∈K0.
In addition,
0 =

⟨˜v(n), ˜Q2˜v(n)⟩˜K

2n+2 =

⟨˜Q˜v(n), ˜Q˜v(n)⟩˜K

2n+2
=

( ˜Q˜v(n))n+1, ( ˜Q˜v(n))n+1

K ,
thus ( ˜Q˜v(n))n+1 ∈K00 and there exists a vn+1 ∈K with ( ˜Q˜v(n))n+1 +Q(0)vn+1 =
0. We then set
(˜v(n+1))k := (˜v(n))k + δn+1,k vn+1
and ﬁnd
( ˜Q˜v(n+1))k =

( ˜Q˜v(n))k = 0
for
0 ≤k ≤n
( ˜Q˜v(n))n+1 + Q(0)vn+1 = 0
for
k = n + 1 .
Therefore,
˜v := lim
n→∞˜v(n) ∈˜K0
is then the wanted formal power series.
(iv): Let ˜π([ ˜F]) = 0. This means that ˜F = 
k κkF(k) ∈Ker ˜s and ˜F ˜v ∈
˜K00 , ∀˜v ∈˜K0. The former implies F(0) ∈Ker s0, hence π([F(0)]) is well deﬁned.
Let v0 ∈K0 arbitrary. According to (iii), there exists a ˜v ∈˜K0 with (˜v)0 = v0.
From ˜F ˜v = ˜Q ˜w for some ˜w ∈˜K, we conclude F(0)v0 = Q(0)( ˜w)0, i.e., F(0)v0 ∈K00.
Hence, π([F(0)]) = 0, which contradicts the assumption.
□
With regard to the statement (iii) we point out that in general v −→˜v is
non-unique and this holds true also for the induced relation v + K00 −→˜v + ˜K00
between H and ˜H. Namely, we may add to ˜v a non-vanishing solution ˜η of ˜Q˜η = 0
with (˜η)0 = 0 and ˜η ̸∈˜K00.
We understand ˜C := C[[κ]] as a ring with unit ˜1 = (1, 0, 0, . . .); ˜a ∈˜C is
invertible if and only if (˜a)0 ̸= 0, cf. (A.1.3). Note that ˜C ˜K = ˜K, but
ˆF0 := ˜C ˜F0 = { ˜a ˜F


 ˜a ∈C, ˜F ∈˜F0 }
is in general larger than ˜F0, since the set of generators is larger: ˜a

B(f)κL(g)

0 =

˜aB(f)

κL(g)

0, cf. (5.4.21).
In the following we interpret ˜K and ˆF0 as ˜C-modules.174 This is possible
because the usual multiplication of formal power series (A.1.2) yields maps
˜C × ˆF0 −→ˆF0
(˜a, ˜F) −→˜a ˜F = ˜F ˜a
and
˜C × ˜K −→˜K
(˜a, ˜v) −→˜a˜v = ˜v˜a ,
174A ˜C-module is a generalization of a C-vector space; the diﬀerence is that the “scalars” are
elements of ˜C instead of C.

respectively, which fulﬁll the relations
˜F(˜a˜v) = ˜a( ˜F ˜v) = (˜a ˜F)˜v ,
(˜a ˜F)∗= ˜a ˜F ∗,
⟨˜a˜v,˜b ˜w⟩= ˜a˜b ⟨˜v, ˜w⟩
(5.4.25)
and
˜s(˜a ˜F) = ˜a ˜s( ˜F) .
Also the physical pre Hilbert space ˜H and the local algebra of observables ˆA(O) :=
˜C ˜A(O) are ˜C-modules, and the multiplications by a “scalar”,
˜C × ˆA(O) −→ˆA(O)
(˜a, [ ˜F]) −→˜a [ ˜F] = [˜a ˜F] = [ ˜F] ˜a
and
˜C × ˜H −→˜H
(˜a, [˜v]) −→˜a [˜v] = [˜a˜v] = [˜v] ˜a ,
satisfy the relations (5.4.25) (with ˜v, ˜w and ˜F replaced by [˜v], [ ˜w] and [ ˜F], respec-
tively).
We are now going to prove that every [˜v] ∈˜H can be normalized:
Lemma 5.4.10 ([48]). For every [˜v] ∈˜H with [˜v] ̸= 0, there exist [ ˜w] ∈˜H and
˜a ∈˜C such that
[˜v] = ˜a [ ˜w]
and

[ ˜w], [ ˜w]

˜
H = ˜1 .
(5.4.26)
Proof. We set ˜b := ⟨[˜v], [˜v]⟩˜
H ∈˜C. From Thm. 5.4.9 we know that ˜b = ∞
n=2k bnκn
with bn ∈R , b2k > 0.
• Case k = 0: There exists an ˜a ∈˜C with ˜a ˜a = ˜b; from b0 ̸= 0 we conclude
(˜a)0 ̸= 0, that is, ˜a is invertible. Then [ ˜w] := ˜a−1[˜v] satisﬁes the assertion
(5.4.26).
• Case k > 0: To trace this case back to the case k = 0, we are searching
a formal power series
˜τk ∈˜K0
with
[˜v] = κk [˜τk] .
(5.4.27)
Having constructed such a ˜τk, we obtain
⟨[˜τk], [˜τk]⟩˜
H = κ−2k ˜b = (b2k, κb2k+1, . . .) .
Similarly to the case k = 0, we then conclude that there exists an invertible
˜c ∈˜C with ˜c ˜c = κ−2k ˜b. Then [ ˜w] := ˜c−1 [˜τk] satisﬁes ⟨[ ˜w], [ ˜w]⟩˜
H = ˜1 and
[˜v] = κk ˜c [ ˜w], that is, the assertion (5.4.26) is satisﬁed for ˜a := κk ˜c.
To construct ˜τk (5.4.27), we consider a representative ˜v = 
n vnκn ∈
˜K0 of [˜v]. The problem is that in general κ−k ˜v contains terms with negative
powers of κ. Due to ⟨v0, v0⟩K = b0 = 0 and Q(0)v0 = 0, there exists η0 ∈K
with Q(0)η0 = v0. Then,
˜τ1 := κ−1
˜v −˜Qη0


434
Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
is a formal power series, which fulﬁlls ˜τ1 ∈˜K0 and [˜v] = κ [˜τ1]. If k > 1, we
have

(˜τ1)0, (˜τ1)0

K =

⟨[˜τ1], [˜τ1]⟩˜
H

0 = b2 = 0
and
Q(0)(˜τ1)0 = 0 ;
hence we can repeat this procedure: There exists η1 ∈K with Q(0)η1 = (˜τ1)0.
Thus,
˜τ2 := κ−1
˜τ1 −˜Qη1

is a formal power series satisfying ˜τ2 ∈˜K0 and κ2 [˜τ2] = κ [˜τ1] = [˜v]. If k > 2
we repeat this procedure again until we obtain (5.4.27).

The deﬁnition of a state (Deﬁnition 2.5.1) can directly be generalized to the present

Since we are dealing with formal power series in the coupling constant κ, positivity

Waldmann sense (Remk. 5.4.7). On the l.h.s. of (iv), ˜1 = (1, 0, 0, . . .) is a formal
power series of functionals, the zeroth component is F(h) = 1 ∀h.

Summing up, we may interpret ˜H (5.4.23) as the space of physical states of
the interacting model.
Remark 5.4.11 (Simpliﬁcations in case that strong adiabatic limit exists). If the
strong adiabatic limit g(x) →1 ∀x ∈M exists and is unique in the sense of Epstein
and Glaser (see App. A.6), it holds that
lim

˜Q = (Q(0), 0, 0, 0, . . .) =: ˜Qg=1
where
Q(0) := ( ˜Q)0 .
(5.4.30)

5.4.
Connection of observable algebras and ﬁeld algebras

We will verify this statement for the formal adiabatic limit of QED in Sect. 5.5.2.
For purely massive models the strong adiabatic limit exists [67] and, hence, the
relation (5.4.30) can be applied. Then, following the Kugo–Ojima formalism [118],
the charge Q(0) obtained by the limit (5.4.30), can be identiﬁed with the BRST
charge of the incoming free ﬁelds. In this case, the physical pre Hilbert space is
˜H := Ker ˜Qg=1
Ran ˜Qg=1
.
From
˜Qg=1 :
 ˜K −→˜K
˜v = 
n κnvn −→Q(0)˜v =

we see that ˜H is the space of formal power series with coeﬃcients in H =

“perturbative gauge invariance” [43, 49, 56, 59, 149], which is a somewhat stronger
condition than (5.4.31), but has the advantage that it is well deﬁned independent
of the adiabatic limit.

Veriﬁcation of the assumptions for QED
Also this section follows [48].
The construction given in the previous section relies on some assumptions,
which we are now going to verify for QED. The deformation is given by going over
from the free theory to the interacting ﬁelds ˜F, see (5.4.21). For the free theory we
will ﬁrst deﬁne the BRST transformation s and then we will construct a nilpotent
and symmetric operator Q which implements s in a representation space with
indeﬁnite inner product. For the interacting theory we will proceed essentially as
in Exercise 5.4.2: We ﬁrst construct a symmetric and nilpotent operator ˜Q, with
that we deﬁne ˜s( ˜F) as the graded commutator of ˜Q with ˜F. For both, the free
and the interacting theory, the local observables (deﬁned by (5.4.10)) are then
naturally represented on H = Ker Q
Ran Q or ˜H = Ker ˜
Q
Ran ˜
Q, respectively, by (5.4.18).
It remains to prove the positivity of the inner product induced in H and ˜H,
respectively. For the free theory this can be done by determining explicitly (distin-
guished) representatives of the equivalence classes in H and by showing that the
inner product is positive deﬁnite on the subspace formed by this representatives.
Turning to the interacting theory, we want to use Thm. 5.4.9 to obtain positivity
for ˜H. For this purpose we need that the 0th coeﬃcient ( ˜Q)0 satisﬁes the positivity
assumption (5.4.15). It is unclear whether this holds true, because the integrals
deﬁning ( ˜Q)0 and the charge Q of the free theory, diﬀer by a spatial infrared cut-
oﬀ. By means of a spatial compactiﬁcation we can reach that ( ˜Q)0 = Q and, with
that, Thm. 5.4.9 can be applied.
We assume that the reader is familiar with the quantization of the free pho-
ton, spinor and ghost ﬁeld(s) in the Fock spaces Fphoton, Fspinor and Fghost, respec-
tively; references are given in App. A.5. For the photon ﬁeld we choose Feynman
gauge throughout, that is, we set λ = 1 in (5.1.85).
5.5.1
The free theory
In this section all ﬁelds F ∈FQED and all ﬁeld polynomials B(x) are throughout
restricted to CS0. To simplify the notation we nearly always omit the lower index
“0” of
F0 ∈FQED


CS0 =: FQED,0 ,
(5.5.1)
which is frequently written in other sections to indicate the restriction to CS0.

Veriﬁcation of the assumptions for QED

where B(f) ≡B(f)0 and F μν := ∂μAν −∂νAμ; later on we will specify which
ﬁeld polynomials we mean by the dots. The representation ρ of F0, which is part
of the assumptions made in Sect. 5.4.2, can be obtained as follows: According to
Thm. 2.6.3, the algebra (F0, ⋆) has a faithful representation on the Fock space
FQED := Fphoton ⊗Fspinor ⊗Fghost. There is a dense subspace K = Kphoton ⊗
Kspinor ⊗Kghost of FQED which is deﬁned analogously to the subspace D (2.6.8).
And, similarly to that space D, K is “invariant”, i.e., satisﬁes the relation (2.6.9).
This representation of (F0, ⋆) on K is the representation ρ. For B as in (5.5.2), we
deﬁne ρ

in the usual way:
	
dx f(x) ρ

∀f ∈D(M) .
(5.5.3)
We still have to construct the indeﬁnite product ⟨· , ·⟩on K: it is deﬁned in
terms of the Fock space scalar product (· , ·) and a “Krein operator” J : K −→K:
⟨v, w⟩:= (v, J w) ,
∀v, w ∈K ,
(5.5.4)
with J satisfying the relations
J2 = Id ,
J+ = J .
(5.5.5)
Here and in the following, O+ denotes the adjoint of the operator O: K −→K
with respect to the scalar product (· , ·). Deﬁning
OK := J O+ J
we obtain
⟨O v, w⟩= (v, O+ J w) = ⟨v, OK w⟩
∀v, w ∈K .
(5.5.6)
Note also that (O1O2)K = OK
2 OK
1 .
The condition determining the Krein operator J is (5.4.12), which can be
written as176
ρ(F ∗) = ρ(F)K ,
∀F ∈F0
(5.5.7)
by using (5.5.6).
In a ﬁrst step we determine J such that (5.5.7) holds true for F being a basic
ﬁeld. Working in Feynman gauge, one can construct the photon ﬁeld in Fock space
such that
ρ(A0(x))+ = −ρ(A0(x)) ,
ρ(Ak(x))+ = ρ(Ak(x))
for
k = 1, 2, 3 ,
see, e.g., [148, 149]. Setting
J := Jphoton ⊗Jspinor ⊗Jghost
with
Jphoton := (−1)N0 ,
(5.5.8)
where N0 is the particle number operator (see (A.5.7)) for scalar photons (i.e., the
particles belonging to the component μ = 0 of the photon ﬁeld Aμ(x)), we indeed
obtain
ρ(Aμ(x))K = Jphoton ρ(Aμ(x))+ Jphoton = ρ(Aμ(x)) = ρ(Aμ(x)∗)
176In accordance with (3.4.21) we deﬁne (F0)∗:= (F ∗)0 for all F ∈FQED.

438
Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
for μ = 0, 1, 2, 3, since (−1)N0 ρ(A0(x)) (−1)N0 = −ρ(A0(x)) . Following wide-

where (5.1.25) is used. Therefore, to fulﬁll (5.5.7), we set
Jspinor := Id .
(5.5.9)
For brevity, we do not give an explicit deﬁnition of Jghost; we only mention that
it can be deﬁned such that
ρ(u(x))K = ρ(u(x)∗)

= ρ(u(x))

,
ρ(˜u(x))K = ρ(˜u(x)∗)

= −ρ(˜u(x))

,
where (5.1.76) is inserted; for details we refer to [48, 117, 149].
In a second step we explain that this deﬁnition of J implies the required
relation (5.5.7) for all F ∈F0. Let φ1, φ2 ∈{Aμ, ψ, ψ, u, ˜u}, so we know ρ(φ∗
j(x)) =
φj(x)K. The claim (5.5.7) is quite obvious if F is the star product of basic ﬁelds,
e.g., for F = φ1(x) ⋆φ2(y). Namely:

(5.5.10)
More complicated is the case in which F is the classical product of basic ﬁelds,
e.g., for F = (φ1 ∧φ2)(x). By using (5.5.10), cK = J c J = c ∀c ∈C, ω0(F) =
ω0(F ∗) and ﬁnally (5.1.26), we get

(5.5.11)

that

replace φj by ∂ajφj for j = 1, 2, throughout.

Veriﬁcation of the assumptions for QED

BRST transformation. Motivated by (5.4.1) and (5.4.2), we are going to deﬁne
s : FQED,0 −→FQED,0 such that it is a graded derivation with respect to the
classical product.
Deﬁnition 5.5.1 (BRST transformation of the free theory). For the basic ﬁelds
we set
s(Aμ) := i∂μu ,
s(ψ) := 0 ,
s(ψ) := 0 ,
s(u) := 0 ,
s(˜u) := −i ∂μAμ .
(5.5.13)
We extend this deﬁnition to ﬁeld polynomials (which may be local or non-local) by
requiring that s is a graded derivation with respect to the tensor product and the
classical product, where the relevant grading is the even-odd grading with respect
to the ghost number (5.1.107) (similarly to (5.4.3)). Explicitly, we deﬁne
s

Aμ1(y1) · · · Aμr(yr) ⊗ψ(x1) ∧· · · ∧ψ(xn) ⊗˜u(z1) ∧· · · ∧u(zs)

(5.5.14)
:= s(Aμ1)(y1) · · · Aμr(yr) ⊗ψ(x1) ∧· · · ∧ψ(xn) ⊗˜u(z1) ∧· · · ∧u(zs) + · · ·
+ Aμ1(y1) · · · s(Aμr)(yr) ⊗ψ(x1) ∧· · · ∧ψ(xn) ⊗˜u(z1) ∧· · · ∧u(zs)

+ (−1)s−1 Aμ1(y1) · · · Aμr(yr) ⊗ψ(x1) ∧· · · ∧ψ(xn) ⊗˜u(z1) ∧· · · ∧s(u)(zs) .
With that we deﬁne s : FQED,0 −→FQED,0 by writing F ∈FQED,0 as177 F =

Note also that the values s(ψ) = 0 = s(ψ) are motivated by gauge invariance
of ψ(x) and ψ(x) in free ﬁeld theory, cf. (5.5.53).
Proposition 5.5.2. The BRST transformation s : FQED,0 −→FQED,0 is a graded
derivation also with respect to the star product:
s(F ⋆G) = s(F) ⋆G + (−1)δ(F ) F ⋆s(G) ,
(5.5.17)
if F is an eigenvector of the ghost number operator θu (5.1.103).
This proposition holds only, if the signs of the propagators of the star pro-
duct for the photon and the ghost ﬁelds (which are a matter of conventions) are
coordinated with each other, as the following example shows:
s(Aμ)(x) ⋆˜u(y) + Aμ(x) ⋆s(˜u)(y) −s

Aμ(x) ⋆˜u(y)

= i ω0

∂μu(x) ⋆˜u(y)

Aμ(x) ⋆∂νAν(y)

= 0 .
Proof. Using M : (FQED,0)⊗2 −→FQED,0 (2.1.8) to denote the classical product,
the derivation property of s with respect to the classical product (5.5.16) can be
written as
s ◦M = M ◦ˆs
where
ˆs := s ⊗Id +(−1)δ1 Id ⊗s ,
(5.5.18)
and the linear operator (−1)δ1 : (FQED,0)⊗2 −→(FQED,0)⊗2 is deﬁned as follows:
Writing L ∈FQED,0 as a sum of eigenvectors of θu,
L =

j

with
δ(Lj) = j ,
we set
(−1)δ1(L ⊗K) :=

j
(−1)j(Lj ⊗K) ,
∀L, K ∈FQED,0 .
With (2.1.7) and (5.5.18) the assertion can be written as
M ◦ˆs ◦eℏDH = M ◦eℏDH ◦ˆs ;

straightforwardly by using the explicit formulas (5.5.13).
Now, let us assume that the relations (5.5.22) are satisﬁed for F = F1 and F = F2. Then
they hold also for the classical product F = F1 ∧F2. This follows from the derivation
property (5.5.16), as we are now going to verify: For δ(s(F)) = δ(F) −1 this is obvious
due to (5.1.105); for the nilpotency this is a straightforward calculation,
s2(F1 ∧F2) = s

s(F1) ∧F2 + (−1)δ(F1) F1 ∧s(F2)

= s2(F1) ∧F2 + (−1)δ(s(F1)) s(F1) ∧s(F2) + (−1)δ(F1) s(F1) ∧s(F2) + F1 ∧s2(F2)
= 0 ;
the compatibility with the ∗-operation is obtained by using (5.1.26) and (5.1.106):

(F1 ∧F2)∗

Proceeding iteratively, we conclude that the relations (5.5.22) are fulﬁlled for F being an
arbitrary (local or non-local) ﬁeld polynomial. By means of (5.5.15) we ﬁnd that they
hold true for all F ∈FQED,0, e.g.,

this implies s

Turning to the subspace F0 (5.5.2) of FQED,0, we want that s : FQED,0 −→
FQED,0 induces a well-deﬁned map s : F0 −→F0. All we need for that is s(F0) ⊆
F0. To reach the latter we specify the dots in formula (5.5.2): They stand for
s(B) where B runs through all the ﬁeld monomials written in that formula before
the dots.
Implementation of the BRST transformation by the Kugo–Ojima charge Q. Due
to the free ﬁeld equations and (5.5.12) the current
Jμ(x) := ℏ−1 ρ

(∂νAν(x))
↔
∂μu(x)

is conserved:
∂μ
xJμ(x) = 0 ,
(5.5.23)
where the shorthand notation
f(x)
↔
∂μg(x) := f(x) ∂μg(x) −(∂μf)(x) g(x)
(5.5.24)
is used. Proceeding heuristically, the pertinent charge reads
Q :=
	
d3x J0(c, ⃗x) .
(5.5.25)
It does not depend on the choice of c ∈R; this follows from ∂μJμ = 0 and Gauss’
integral theorem (A.1.13).
Working rigorously, the existence of the integral in (5.5.25) is unclear, since
J0(x) is integrated out with δ(x0 −c) instead of an element of D(R4). We point
out that this problem does not appear for the graded commutator
[Q, ρ(F)]∓:= Q ρ(F) −(−1)δ(F ) ρ(F) Q =
	
d3x [J0(c, ⃗x), ρ(F)]∓,
F ∈F0 ,
(5.5.26)
because the region of integration is bounded; and, due to the latter, the reasoning
by means of Gauss’ integral theorem that the commutator (5.5.26) does not de-
pend on c, is rigorous. This is completely analogous to the commutator [Qψ
0 , F0]⋆,
studied in detail in Exer. 5.1.7.
Nevertheless, for our construction of physical states in Sect. 5.4.2, we need
to give the integral (5.5.25) a rigorous sense, in order that Q : K −→K is a
well-deﬁned linear operator. This can be done by the following method due to
Requardt [144]: The integral
	
d4x k(x0)h(⃗x) J0(x0, ⃗x)
certainly exists, if
k(x0)h(⃗x) ∈D(R4, R) .
We choose k ∈D(R, R) and h ∈D(R3, R) such that
	
dx0 k(x0) = 1
and
h(⃗x) = 1 ∀⃗x ∈R3 with |⃗x| ≤R
(5.5.27)
for some R > 0. The scaled test functions
kλ(x0) := λ k(λx0) ,
hλ(⃗x) := h(λ⃗x) ,
λ > 0 ,
(5.5.28)

Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
satisfy the properties (5.5.27) with R replaced by R
λ , and the operator
Qλ :=
	
d4x kλ(x0)hλ(⃗x) J0(x0, ⃗x)
exists. By a straightforward calculation one can prove that
lim
λ↓0 ∥QλΩ∥2 = lim
λ↓0 (QλΩ, QλΩ) = 0 ,
(5.5.29)
where (· , ·) denotes the Fock space scalar product and Ω ∈K is the vacuum
vector. In addition, we consider the limit
lim
λ↓0 [Qλ, ρ(F)]∓= lim
λ↓0
	
dx0 kλ(x0)
	
d3x hλ(⃗x) [J0(x0, ⃗x), ρ(F)]∓.
(5.5.30)
Let supp k ⊆[a, b]; then we have supp kλ ⊆[ a
λ, b
λ]. Choosing R > 0 big enough
compared to max{|a|, |b|}, we can reach that

for all λ > 0 suﬃciently small. With that we may replace hλ(⃗x) by 1 in the integral
(5.5.30). By using that the commutator (5.5.26) does not depend on c, we get
lim
λ↓0[Qλ, ρ(F)]∓=
	
d3x [J0(c, ⃗x), ρ(F)]∓lim
λ↓0
	
dx0 kλ(x0)

= [Q, ρ(F)]∓.
(5.5.31)
With that we can show that the strong limit limλ↓0 Qλ exists, that is, limλ↓0 Qλw
exists for all w ∈K. Namely, since K is deﬁned analogously to the subspace D
(2.6.8), it suﬃces to consider
lim
λ↓0 Qλ ρ

φn(fn)


(5.5.32)
where φ1, . . . φn are arbitrary basic ﬁelds and n ∈N, f1, . . . , fn ∈D(R4) are also
arbitrary. Using (5.5.29) and (5.5.31), the limit (5.5.32) is equal to

]∓Ω = [Q, ρ

φ1(f1)⋆· · ·⋆φn(fn)

Since in the last commutator the heuristic deﬁnition of Q (5.5.25) appears (which
is well deﬁned in this context, see (5.5.26)), we may give the integral (5.5.25) a
rigorous sense by deﬁning
Qw := lim
λ↓0 Qλw
∀w ∈K .
(5.5.34)

5.5.
Veriﬁcation of the assumptions for QED

This deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the test functions h and k (pro-
vided they satisfy the properties (5.5.27)), because the r.h.s. of (5.5.33) is inde-
pendent of this choice. In particular we get
Ω ∈Ker Q
(5.5.35)
from (5.5.29).
In view of a particle interpretation of H = Ker Q
Ran Q we introduce the “scalar and
longitudinal component of the photon ﬁeld” Aμ(x). The former is simply A0(x).
The latter is deﬁned in momentum space by

ρ(A)∥(k) :=
⃗k · 
ρ( ⃗A)(⃗k)
|⃗k|
.
(5.5.36)
Note the following: Since the elements of CS0 (more precisely Cphoton,(Sphoton
0
+Sgf
0 ))
may have bad decay properties, it is a priory unclear whether the Fourier transfor-
mation of A(x) exists. However, it is well known that the Fourier transformation
applied to the free photon ﬁeld in Fock space yields a well-deﬁned operator-valued
distribution. Therefore, we introduce the longitudinal component for ρ(A) instead
of A. To introduce the transversal components of the photon ﬁeld, let ⃗ε(⃗k) ∈R3
be a polarization vector, i.e.,
⃗ε(⃗k) · ⃗k = 0 ,
|ε(⃗k)| = 1 .
Then,

ρ(A)⃗ε(k) := ⃗ε(⃗k) · 
ρ( ⃗A)(⃗k)
is the “transversal component of 
ρ(A) with polarization ⃗ε ”. Returning to x-space
ρ(A)∥(x) and ρ(A)⃗ε(x) are obtained from 
ρ(A)∥(k) and 
ρ(A)⃗ε(k) by inverse Fourier
transformation.

for n > 1 the free ﬁeld operators have to be normally ordered; only for n = 1 it
may be omitted, due to :ϕop(f): = ϕop(f).

Proposition 5.5.4 (Basic properties of the free BRST charge Q, [48]).
(a) The free BRST charge Q (5.5.25) (or more precisely (5.5.34)) fulﬁlls

Q2 = 0
and implements the BRST transformation s (given in Deﬁnition 5.5.1):

(5.5.38)
where [· , ·]∓denotes the graded commutator (5.4.13).
(b) Let Q+ : K −→K be the adjoint operator of Q : K −→K with respect to the
Fock space scalar product ( · , · ). With that, the identity
Ker Q ∩Ker Q+ = Ker(QQ+ + Q+Q)
holds true, and the elements of this subspace are distinguished representa-
tives of the equivalence classes in the physical space H =
Ker Q
Ran Q. They are
states which do not contain any longitudinal or scalar photons, ghosts or
anti-ghosts; that is they are built up from electrons, positrons and transversal
photons only.
(c) The inner product ⟨· , ·⟩on K satisﬁes positivity (5.4.15), that is, it is positive
semideﬁnite on Ker Q and the subspace of null vectors in Ker Q is precisely
Ran Q.
Proof. Essentially we follow [149, Sect. 1.4] and [48, App. A], which are partly
based on [44, Sect. 5]; see also [87].

Let [Q, ρ(Fj)]∓= s(Fj) , j = 1, 2. Since X −→[Q, X]∓is a graded derivation,
the implementation (5.5.38) holds then also for the star product F = F1 ⋆F2;
explicitly:
[Q , ρ(F1 ⋆F2)]∓= [Q , ρ(F1)]∓ρ(F2) ± ρ(F1) [Q , ρ(F2)]∓

More complicated is the proof of the corresponding statement for the classical
product:

.
(5.5.39)
We only treat the example F = (φ1 ∧φ2)(x), where φ1, φ2 are basic ﬁelds. Since
s(1) = 0 – this is a consequence of the derivation property of s – we obtain

that is, the map X −→[Q, X]∓commutes with normal ordering of Fock space
operators. For an alternative, direct proof of (5.5.41) we refer to [149, Lemma
3.1.1].
Since F0 (5.5.2) can be generated from the basic ﬁelds by applying the clas-
sical product and the star product, the proof of the implementation (5.5.38) is
complete.

Part (b): Let
(Ran Q+)⊥:= { v ∈K


 (v, w) = 0 ∀w ∈Ran Q+ }
and generally we write “⊥” for “orthogonal with respect to (· , ·)”. For v ∈K it
holds that
Qv = 0
⇔
(v, Q+w) = 0
∀w ∈K ,
that is, Ker Q = (Ran Q+)⊥, which implies
K = Ker Q ⊕Ran Q+
with
Ker Q ⊥Ran Q+ .
(5.5.42)
Exchanging Q ↔Q+ we also get
K = Ker Q+ ⊕Ran Q
with
Ker Q+ ⊥Ran Q .
(5.5.43)
Due to Q2 = 0 it holds that
Ran Q ⊆Ker Q
and, hence,
Ran Q ⊥Ran Q+ .
(5.5.44)
Let P1 and P2 be the orthogonal projections onto Ran Q+ and Ran Q, respectively,
that is, Pj : K −→K satisﬁes P 2
j
= Pj, P +
j
= Pj and Ran P1 = Ran Q+,
Ran P2 = Ran Q. Because of (5.5.42), the operator (Id −P1) is the orthogonal
projection onto Ker Q and, similarly, (Id −P2) is the orthogonal projection onto
Ker Q+. From (5.5.44) we know P1P2 = 0, hence we obtain
Id −P1 −P2 = (Id −P1)(Id −P2) = (Id −P2)(Id −P1) ;
this operator is the orthogonal projection onto Ker Q ∩Ker Q+. We conclude that
K = P1K ⊕P2K ⊕(Id −P1 −P2)K
= Ran Q+ ⊕Ran Q ⊕(Ker Q ∩Ker Q+)
(5.5.45)
and that these three spaces are pairwise orthogonal (w.r.t. (· , ·)). Comparing
(5.5.42) with (5.5.45) we ﬁnd
Ker Q = Ran Q ⊕(Ker Q ∩Ker Q+) .
(5.5.46)
Therefore, the vectors v ∈(Ker Q ∩Ker Q+) are distinguished representatives of
the equivalence classes [v] ∈Ker Q
Ran Q = H .

5.5.
Veriﬁcation of the assumptions for QED
449
To analyze (Ker Q ∩Ker Q+) we use
(Ker Q ∩Ker Q+) = Ker(QQ+ + Q+Q)
(5.5.47)
which can be seen as follows: The relation “⊆” is obvious. To verify “⊇”, let
v ∈Ker(QQ+ + Q+Q). Then
0 =

v, (QQ+ + Q+Q)v

= ∥Q+v∥2 + ∥Qv∥2, which implies Q+v = 0 ∧Qv = 0.
Let Nunphys be the particle number operator of unphysical particles; that
is, the eigenvalues of Nunphys are: [Number of scalar photons] + [number of lon-
gitudinal photons] + [number of ghosts] + [number of anti-ghosts]. Inserting the
momentum space representation of the basic ﬁelds in terms of creation and annihi-
lation operators (see App. A.5) into (QQ++Q+Q), one obtains that (QQ++Q+Q)
is a modiﬁed version of Nunphys; however, the kernels agree: Ker(QQ+ + Q+Q) =
Ker Nunphys, see the mentioned references. This completes the proof of Part (b).
Part (c): From this characterization of Ker(QQ+ + Q+Q) and from the def-
inition of Jphoton (5.5.8) and Jspinor (5.5.9), we see that
J


Ker(QQ++Q+Q) = Id .
(5.5.48)
Now, let v ∈Ker Q. From (5.5.46) and (5.5.47) we know that
v = v1 + Qw
for some
v1 ∈Ker(QQ+ + Q+Q) , w ∈K ,
and that this splitting into v1 and Qw is unique. By using Q = QK, Qv1 = 0,
Q2 = 0 and (5.5.48) we get
⟨v, v⟩= ⟨v1, v1⟩= (v1, v1) ≥0
and
⟨v, v⟩= 0 ⇔(v1, v1) = 0 ⇔v1 = 0 ⇔v ∈Ran Q .
As a byproduct (which is not needed for the proof of the proposition) we note:
From QK = Q and J2 = Id we obtain JQ = Q+J and JQ+ = QJ; since JK = K
these relations imply
J Ran Q = Ran Q+ ,
J Ran Q+ = Ran Q .

for all [v] ∈H, the observable [u(g)] is represented by zero on H.
To make the representation π faithful, we reduce A as follows: Let Aphys be
the subalgebra of A with ghost number zero, explicitly
Aphys := { [F] = F + Ran s



 F ∈Ker s ∧θuF = 0 } .
Note that for [F], [G] ∈Aphys we indeed have [F] ⋆[G] = [F ⋆G] ∈Aphys, due
to (5.1.105). The representation π (5.4.18) of Aphys on H is in fact faithful. To
make this plausible we mention that the elements of Aphys are built up from the
(derivated) basic ﬁelds F μν := ∂μAν −∂νAμ, ψ and ψ, more precisely178
Aphys =

Local algebras of interacting ﬁelds. We now replace the ﬁelds F0 ∈F0 (5.5.2) of the
free theory by the corresponding interacting ﬁelds FL(g) = ∞
n=0 en Fn,0, where
L(g) = eL(g) is taken into account. The Fock space representation ρ : FQED,0 −→
L(K) introduced for the free theory (L(K) denotes the space of linear operators
form K to K), yields a representation of the interacting ﬁelds: Since Fn,0 ∈FQED,0,
ρ(Fn,0) is well deﬁned for all n ∈N. By using (5.5.7), L(g)∗= L(g) and the ∗-

179Alternatively, one could throughout work with on-shell ﬁelds by using the on-shell R-product
Ron introduced in Sect. 3.4, or one could work with the R-product of Epstein and Glaser [66],
which is a map from local Wick polynomials to Wick polynomials – the latter is used in [48].

Veriﬁcation of the assumptions for QED
451
Since the interaction L(g) does not contain any ghost ﬁelds u, ˜u, we may
apply the renormalization condition (5.1.81): With P and Q being polynomials of
the same kind as in that formula, it holds that

P(ψ, ψ, A)Q(u, ˜u)

L(g)(x) = P(ψ, ψ, A)L(g)(x) · Q(u, ˜u)0(x) ,
in particular
uL(g)(x) = u0(x) ,
˜uL(g)(x) = ˜u0(x) ,
(5.5.50)
that is, the ghost ﬁelds do not couple.
We shall study the algebra ˜F0(O) of interacting on-shell ﬁelds localized in O,
as introduced in (5.3.3) and after (5.4.21). However, note the change of notation:
For an element of ˜F0 := ∪O˜F0(O), we now write ˜F0 = ∞
n=0 en Fn,0 instead of
(5.4.20). For simplicity, we choose
O :=

(−r,⃗0) + V+

∩

(r,⃗0) + V−

,
r > 0 ,
(5.5.51)
and for the switching function g ∈D(M) we assume
g(x) = 1
∀x ∈U
for a bounded, open neighbourhood U of O.
(5.5.52)
The generalization of the derivations and proofs given in this section to arbitrary
open double cones O is an easy task.
BRST transformation and interacting Kugo–Ojima charge. For QED the BRST
transformation is of the form
˜s = s0 + e s1 : ˜F0(O) −→˜F0(O) .
For x ∈O (and, hence, g(x) = 1) it should have the following values on the basic
ﬁelds: For AL(g), ψL(g), ψL(g) it is formally an inﬁnitesimal gauge transformation,
˜s(Aμ
L(g))(x) := i ∂
∂α



α=0(Aμ
L(g) + α∂μu0)(x) = i∂μu0(x) = s0(Aμ
L(g))(x) ,
˜s(ψL(g))(x)
:= i ∂
∂α



α=0ψL(g)(x) eα i eℏu0(x) = −eℏψL(g)(x) u0(x) = e s1(ψL(g))(x) ,
˜s(ψL(g))(x)
(5.5.53)
:= i ∂
∂α



α=0ψL(g)(x) e−α i eℏu0(x) = eℏψL(g)(x) u0(x) = e s1(ψL(g))(x) ;
for the ghost ﬁelds ˜s has the same form as in the free theory:
˜s(uL(g))(x) = s0(uL(g))(x) = 0 ,
˜s(˜uL(g))(x) = s0(˜uL(g))(x) = −i∂x
μAμ
L(g)(x) ,
(5.5.54)
where we could also write u0 and ˜u0 in place of uL(g) and ˜uL(g), respectively, due
to (5.5.50). Note that ˜s(˜uL(g))(x) depends on the interaction L(g), although this

452
Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
does not hold for ˜uL(g)(x) = ˜u0(x). We point out: In contrast to the free theory,
ψL(g) and ψL(g) are not observables in the sense of our deﬁnition (5.4.8). This
diﬀerent behaviour can be understood physically by the fact that an electron and
a positron are always accompanied by a soft photon cloud.
In addition, ˜s should be a graded derivation which is nilpotent and com-
patible with the ∗-operation (properties (5.4.3)–(5.4.5)). These properties will be
automatically satisﬁed by proceeding similarly to Exer. 5.4.2: We construct the
BRST charge QL : K −→K for the interacting theory, satisfying QK
L = QL and
Q 2
L = 0, and deﬁne ˜s by ˜s( ˜F0) := ρ−1
[QL , ρ( ˜F0)]∓

; then we will have to ver-
ify that this deﬁnition induces the transformations (5.5.53)–(5.5.54) on the basic
ﬁelds.
To get QL we follow Kugo and Ojima [118]: We replace the current Jμ (5.5.23)
underlying the free charge Q (5.5.25) by the corresponding interacting ﬁeld

d⃗x [J0
L(g)(0, ⃗x) , ρ( ˜F0)]∓,
˜F0 ∈˜F0(O) .
(5.5.58)
cf. (5.5.26). In order that ˜s( ˜F0) ∈˜F0(O) it must hold that the integral on the
r.h.s. is an element of ρ
˜F0(O)

. The latter relies on the fact that the region of
integration in (5.5.58) is bounded by |⃗x| < r, that is (0, ⃗x) ∈O; hence J0
L(g)(0, ⃗x) ∈
ρ
˜F0(O)

, which implies [J0
L(g)(0, ⃗x) , ρ( ˜F0)]∓∈ρ

due to

∀˜F0 ∈˜F0(O) .
(5.5.59)
This support property can be seen as follows: If ˜F0 is a generator of ˜F0(O), i.e.,
˜F0 = FL(g) with supp F ⊂O, the relation (5.5.59) relies on Remk. 3.1.6. The gen-
eralization to an arbitrary ˜F0 ∈˜F0(O) can be obtained by means of the derivation

and by taking into account the deﬁnition of the support (5.1.97).
Now, for a given r > 0 let O, U and g as in (5.5.51)–(5.5.52); in addition, let
ε > 0 such that r ≫ε and


Then, there exists a function ˜h ≡(˜hμ),
˜hμ(x) := δμ0 h(x)
with
h(x) = h(0)(x0) h(1)(⃗x) ∈D(U, R) ,

This implies that

(5.5.62)
implements the transformation ˜s (5.5.58). Namely, in the expression

dx0 h(0)(x0)
	
d⃗x h(1)(⃗x) [J0
L(g)(x0, ⃗x) , ρ( ˜F0)]∓
we may replace h(1)(⃗x) by 1, since for x0 ∈supp h(0) it holds that

 (x0, ⃗x) ∈suppx[J0
L(g)(x) , ρ( ˜F0)]∓} ⊂{ ⃗x



 |⃗x| < r + ε } ,
see again Figure 5.2. Then, because of current conservation (5.5.57) and Gauss’
integral theorem (A.1.13), we may replace J0
L(g)(x0, ⃗x) by J0
L(g)(0, ⃗x) and end up

Actually, the freedom in the deﬁnition of QL(g, ˜h) (5.5.62) is larger than
(5.5.60): Due to current conservation (5.5.57) we have
QL(g, ˜h) = QL(g, k)
where
k ≡(kμ) ,

∀x, y ∈supp h .
(5.5.68)
Due to Remk. 3.1.6, the vanishing of this commutator is nontrivial only for (x −
y)2 ≥0. Let x ∈y + V −. Then we know from (5.5.61) that g(z) = 1 for all z in a
neighbourhood of (x+V +)∩(y+V −). Therefore, we can apply Proposition 5.3.1(b)
to conclude that the commutator (5.5.68) vanishes indeed. The case y ∈x + V −
is completely analogous.
With that all assumptions made in Exer. 5.4.2 are satisﬁed. In addition, from
QL(g, ˜h) ∈ρ(˜F0) (5.5.62) we conclude that
ρ

˜s : ˜F0 −→˜F0 fulﬁlling properties (5.4.3)–(5.4.5).
That the so-deﬁned ˜s preserves the localization region, ˜s


⊆˜F0(O)
(5.4.6), follows from Thm. 5.5.5 below: An interacting ﬁeld at y ∈O is mapped to
an interacting ﬁeld at the same point y.180 In addition, Thm. 5.5.5 states that the
map ˜s (5.5.58) has the required values (5.5.53)–(5.5.54) on the basic ﬁelds; and
also for all further interacting ﬁelds belonging to sub monomials of the interaction
Lagrangian L = jμAμ = ψ /Aψ, the values of ˜s agree with what one expects from
the BRST transformation in classical Electrodynamics.
Theorem 5.5.5 (BRST transformation for QED, [48]). We assume that the inter-
acting ﬁelds are renormalized as described in Sects. 5.1 and 5.2, especially that
they fulﬁll the ﬁeld equations (5.3.1) and the QED-MWI (5.2.7). Furthermore, let
O, g and k be as before, see (5.5.51), (5.5.52) and (5.5.64), respectively. Then,
the BRST transformation of interacting ﬁelds localized at y ∈O has the following
values: For the basic interacting ﬁelds (with derivatives)
[QL(g, k) , Aμ
L(g)(y)]−= i ∂μu0(y) ,
[QL(g, k) , ∂μAμ

We emphasize that the commutation relations given in this theorem are in-
dependent of the choice of g (provided we remain in the class of test functions
satisfying (5.5.52)). This is a nice illustration of Thm. 3.7.1, which is the basis
of the algebraic adiabatic limit. Namely, we may choose for U an open double
cone (3.7.7); then, Thm. 3.7.1 states that the algebraic relations of the algebra
˜F0(U), ⋆

are independent of g, this holds in particular for the commutators
(5.5.69)–(5.5.76), since QL(g, k) ∈ρ
˜F0(U)

.
Proof. The proof goes by explicit computation of the various commutators, it is
based on the commutation relations derived in Proposition 5.3.1.
Using (5.5.63), we compute [J0
L(g)(x), ˜F0]∓, that is, we have to compute com-
mutators of type
[(∂0)∂AL(g)(x) ⊗(∂0)u0(x), BL(g)(y) ⊗1]−
=

(∂0
x)[∂AL(g)(x), BL(g)(y)]−

⊗(∂0)u0(x)
(5.5.77)
or
[(∂0)∂AL(g)(x) ⊗(∂0)u0(x), 1 ⊗G(y)]+
= (∂0)∂AL(g)(x) ⊗(∂0
x)[u0(x), G(y)]+ ,
(5.5.78)
where G ∈{u0, ˜u0} and B is a ﬁeld monomial which does not contain any ghost
ﬁelds. The symbol “⊗” stands for the tensor product of (Fphoton,0 ⊗Fspinor,0) with
Fghost,0. In addition, (∂0) means that at most one derivative
∂
∂x0 is there.
The veriﬁcation of formulas (5.5.71) amounts to the computation of com-
mutators of type (5.5.78): For [QL(g, k), u0(y)]+ we have G = u0 and, hence,
[(∂0)u0(x), G(y)]+ = 0; this yields the assertion. For [QL(g, k), ˜u0(y)]+, formulas
(5.5.63), (5.5.78) (with G = ˜u0) and (5.1.79) give
[QL(g, k) , ˜u0(y)]+ = i

Veriﬁcation of the assumptions for QED

From (5.5.56) we know that □x (∂A)L(g)(x) = 0 for x ∈U. Therefore, we may
apply (A.2.16) to (5.5.79); this yields [QL(g, k) , ˜u0(y)]+ = −i ∂AL(g)(y).
The proofs of (5.5.69), (5.5.70) and (5.5.76) amount to the computation of
commutators of type (5.5.77):

Since both x and y lie in O, we may insert the formulas derived in Proposition
5.3.1 into [∂AL(g)(x), BL(g)(y)]−. For example, we obtain
[QL(g, k) , ψL(g)(y)]−= −eℏψL(g)(y)

by taking into account □u0 = 0 in order to use (A.2.16).
The claim (5.5.74) can be obtained from the ﬁrst relation of (5.5.70) by
means of the ﬁeld equation for ψL(g)(y) (5.3.1):
−e [QL(g, k) , ( /Aψ)L(g)(y)]−= (i/∂y −m)[QL(g, k) , ψL(g)(y)]−
= −eℏ(i/∂y −m)


= −eℏ

−e( /Aψ)L(g)(y) u0(y) + i (/∂u0)(y) ψL(g)(y)

.
Analogously, the second relation of (5.5.70) and the ﬁeld equation for ψL(g)(y)
imply (5.5.75).
Finally the claims (5.5.72) and (5.5.73) can be obtained by applying the
derivatives ∂ν
y and □y, respectively, to the ﬁrst relation of (5.5.69), and by using
F νμ
L(g) = ∂νAμ
L(g) −∂μAν
L(g) in the ﬁrst case, and the ﬁeld equation for Aμ
L(g)(y)
(5.3.1) and □u0(y) = 0 in the second case.
□
In the formal adiabatic limit, ∂νAν
L(g) converges to ∂νAν
0, as noted in (5.3.4).
Therefore, if we perform the adiabatic limit by the scaling gλ(x) := g(λx) (with
λ ↓0, cf. (A.6.1)–(A.6.2)) and if we scale the test function h(x) = h(0)(x0) h(1)(⃗x)
(5.5.60) similarly to (5.5.28), i.e.,
˜hλ μ = δμ0 hλ(x) ,
hλ(x) := λ h(0)(λx0) h(1)(λ⃗x) ,
(5.5.80)
we expect that

λ↓0
	
d4x hλ(x) J0(x) ≡Q
(5.5.81)
with Q being the free Kugo–Ojima charge (5.5.34). However, a proof of this state-
ment requires a rigorous control of the adiabatic limit, which is beyond the scope

458
Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
of this book. Whereas in QED the reasoning (5.5.81) seems to be correct, the
corresponding argument does certainly not work in massless non-Abelian gauge
theories – perturbation theory seems to be unable to describe the long distance
properties of these models, as indicated by experiments showing conﬁnement of
gluons and quarks.181
We therefore prefer not to work in the adiabatic limit. The price to pay is
that QL(g, ˜h) = QL(g, k) does not agree with Q. To construct the physical Hilbert
space by means of Thm. 5.4.9, we have to check the assumptions made there. As
noted above, QL(g, k) is Krein-hermitian (5.5.65) and nilpotent (5.5.67); but we
need in addition that the zeroth order term
Q(0)(k) :=
	
d4x kμ(x) Jμ(x) =
	
d4x h(x) J0(x) =: Q(0)(˜h)
of QL(g, k) satisﬁes the positivity assumption (5.4.15). We only know that the
strong limit
lim
λ↓0 Q(0)(˜hλ) = Q
(≡free BRST charge (5.5.34))
fulﬁlls positivity. However, it is an open question whether this holds for Q(0)(˜hλ)
for any ﬁxed λ > 0; or, whether the freedom in the choice of kμ (5.5.64) is suﬃcient
to prove positivity of Q(0)(k).
Spatial compactiﬁcation. Taking into account the local character of our construc-
tion, this problem can be solved by a spatial compactiﬁcation. Following [48], we
may embed our double cone O (5.5.51) isometrically into the cylinder R × CL,
where CL ⊂R3 is a cube of length L, L ≫r, with suitable boundary conditions,
and where the ﬁrst factor denotes the time axis. If we choose the compactiﬁcation
length L so large that any signal emitted from O which runs around the cylinder
R × CL cannot reach O, the physical properties of the local algebra ˜F0(O) are not
changed.
For the Fock space quantization of the free ﬁelds on this cylinder and in
particular for the choice of suitable boundary conditions we refer to [48, App. A]
and [47]. The inductive construction of the perturbation series for the interacting
ﬁelds is not changed by the compactiﬁcation, in particular the QED-MWI, the
ﬁeld equations (5.3.1) and the commutation relations given in Proposition 5.3.1
can be adopted without any modiﬁcation, as explained in the mentioned references
and, to some extent, in the following remark.
Remark 5.5.6. Let ϕL(x) be the free, real scalar ﬁeld to the mass m ≥0 on R×CL
with Dirichlet boundary conditions, more precisely, ϕL(x0, ⃗x) = 0 if ⃗x ∈∂CL. The
commutator function
ΔL(x, y) := [ϕL(x) , ϕL(y)]⋆

is the fundamental solution of the Klein–Gordon equation on R×CL with Dirichlet
boundary conditions, which has the explicit form [48, App. A]
ΔL(x0, ⃗x , y0, ⃗y) =

s∈S
(−1)n(s) Δ

x0 −y0 , ⃗x −s(⃗y)

,
(5.5.82)
where Δ is the Minkowski space commutator function and S is the group genera-
ted by the reﬂections on the planes which bound CL and n(s) is the number of
reﬂections occurring in s (which is well deﬁned modulo 2). Note that for ⃗y ∈∂CL
there is an s0 ∈S such that s0(⃗y) = ⃗y and n(s0) = 1; therefore, the r.h.s. of
(5.5.82) vanishes in this case, as required by the Dirichlet boundary conditions.
Now let x, y ∈O. Due to supp Δ ⊆(V + ∪V −) only the summand s = Id
contributes on the r.h.s. of (5.5.82), that is,
ΔL(x, y) = Δ(x −y)
∀x, y ∈O .
(5.5.83)
Therefore, the Minkowski space commutator function D ≡Δm=0 appearing in
the commutation relations of Proposition 5.3.1 needs not to be modiﬁed when we
formulate this proposition on R × CL. This illustrates explicitly that the algebraic
relations of ˜F0(O) are not changed by the compactiﬁcation.
The deﬁnition of the BRST transformation ˜s (5.5.58) is not touched by the
compactiﬁcation, because the region of integration in (5.5.58) is bounded by |⃗x| <
r. The construction of the interacting Kugo–Ojima charge QL(g, ˜h) can now be
simpliﬁed as follows: The open neighbourhood U of O (on which the switching
function g is constant: g|U = 1 (5.5.52)) needs to be bounded only in the x0-
direction. More precisely, U is now an open neighbourhood of O ∪

[−ε, ε] × CL

(where still r ≫ε > 0), and we may replace h(1)(⃗x) by 1 in the deﬁnition of ˜h
(5.5.60), because (x0, ⃗x) −→h(0)(x0) is an admissible test function on R × CL.
With these modiﬁcations, the deﬁnition of the interacting Kugo–Ojima charge
(5.5.62) goes over into
QL(g) : K −→K ,
QL(g) :=
	
dx0 h(0)(x0)
	
CL
d⃗x J0
L(g)(x0, ⃗x) .
Since the region of integration is a subset of the time-slice [−ε, ε] × CL ⊂U and
since ∂x
μ Jμ
L(g)(x) = 0
∀x ∈U (5.5.57), we may apply Gauss integral theorem
(A.1.13) to conclude that the result of the spatial integration over CL is indepen-
dent of x0 and, hence, the arbitrariness in the choice of h(0)(x0) drops out:
QL(g) =
	
CL, |c|<ε
d⃗x J0
L(g)(c, ⃗x) .
(5.5.84)
The term of zeroth order is obtained by setting g = 0; it agrees with the free
Kugo–Ojima charge Q on R × CL, since
Q(0) = QL(g = 0) =
	
CL, |c|<ε
d⃗x J0(c, ⃗x) ≡Q ;

Chapter 5. Quantum Electrodynamics
in contrast to (5.5.25), this integral is unproblematic. The proofs that QL(g, ˜h)
(5.5.62)
• implements the BRST transformation (5.5.63),
• is Krein-hermitian (5.5.65),
• has ghost number (−1) (5.5.66)
• and is nilpotent (5.5.67)–(5.5.68),
can easily be translated into proofs of the same properties for the modiﬁed ver-
sion QL(g) (5.5.84) – the compactiﬁcation simpliﬁes these proofs somewhat. Also
Thm. 5.5.5 holds true on R × CL (with QL(g) in place of QL(g, k)), because the
proof of this theorem relies on formula (5.5.63) and on Proposition 5.3.1, which
are valid also on R × CL. With that, our construction of QED is complete.
We emphasize that our construction describes locally QED also in the non-
compactiﬁed Minkowski space (this is our main concern) and, therefore, should
not depend on the compactiﬁcation length L. On the level of the algebras this is
evident: The local algebras of interacting ﬁelds or observables belonging to diﬀerent
values of L are isomorphic. We conjecture that also the state space (i.e., the set of
expectation functionals induced by vectors in Ker QL(g)
Ran QL(g)) is independent of L, but
this is not yet proved.
5.6
Reasons in favour of a LOCAL construction
From experiments we know that strong interactions have the property of conﬁne-
ment. Therefore, perturbation theory fails in the description of the long distance
behaviour. Hence, a local construction of the observables (as developed in this
chapter for QED) seems to be the best one can do in a perturbative approach to
QCD. This is worked out in references [53, 54]; however, with the gap that a proof
of the MWI expressing BRST symmetry, which is needed for this construction, is
missing in these papers. This gap was closed by S. Hollands [105] (cf. below), by
using (among other techniques) our version of the “Quantum Action Principle”
(Thm. 4.3.1). Note that also these subsequent developments (in particular the pa-
pers [53, 105]) need a spatial compactiﬁcation, to prove, by means of the stability
under deformations given in Thm. 5.4.9, that the space of physical (vector) states
Ker QL
Ran QL is positive deﬁnite. A nice application of this formalism would be an ex-
plicit computation of the operator product expansion for QCD, by using also the
results and techniques of [104].
A local construction of a QFT model has also the following crucial advan-
tages, which are not restricted to gauge theories:
• There is a clear separation of the IR-problem (in causal perturbation the-
ory this is the existence and uniqueness of the adiabatic limit) from the
UV-problem (extension of retarded or time-ordered products to coinciding

Reasons in favour of a LOCAL construction
461
points). The former is absent as long as we switch the interaction with a
test function g ∈D(M). In particular the MWI, which expresses the sym-
metries of the model, can be formulated and proved independently of the
IR-behaviour. At the level of the net O −→AL(O) of local observables, the
dependence on the IR-cutoﬀg ∈D(M) can be removed in a well-deﬁned
manner by the algebraic adiabatic limit (see Sect. 3.7); in particular this
limit can be applied to massless non-Abelian gauge theories. We recall that
the algebraic adiabatic limit enables a treatment of the conventional form of
the renormalization group, as a renormalization of the coupling constants,
without meeting any IR-divergences (Sect. 3.8).
Also quantum states are well deﬁned independently of the IR-behaviour;
they are functionals on the local algebras AL(O) with certain properties (see
Sects. 2.5 and 5.4.3). For QED we have constructed the space of physical
states on AL(O) in terms of the Fock–Krein space representation of AL(O)
and the interacting Kugo–Ojima charge QL(g). But, in the construction of
scattering states, we would meet the traditional IR-divergences, cf. App. A.6.
• The generalization of QFT from Minkowski spacetime to a globally hyper-
bolic curved spacetime encounters serious conceptual problems, in particular
the non-existence of a preferred vacuum state on time-dependent spacetimes.
In addition, useful ﬂat spacetime techniques, such as “momentum space”
and “functional integral”, are not applicable. It has turned out that these
problems can be overcome by using algebraic QFT [94], that is, by a local
construction of the observables. For a perturbative construction of the in-
teracting ﬁelds in this framework, causal perturbation theory seems to be
the best method; this is worked out in [23–25, 100–103]. This series of pa-
pers culminates in a construction of “Renormalized Quantum Yang–Mills
ﬁelds in Curved Spacetime” by S. Hollands [105], which is based on the local
construction of QED given in this chapter.

Some notations and a few mathematical
preliminaries
Numbers and permutations. For the set of natural numbers we use the French
convention:
N = {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}
and
N∗:= N \ {0} .
By Sn we mean the symmetric group, i.e., the group of all permutations of the set
{1, . . ., n}. For the signature of a permutation π ∈Sn we use the notation sgn π;
for brevity we sometimes write πj instead of π(j), where j ∈{1, . . . , n}.
Complex numbers z ∈C: By z = Re z −i Im z we denote the complex conju-
gate of z = Re z + i Im z, where Re z, Im z ∈R. In the presence of spinor ﬁelds we
write zc instead of z, to avoid confusion with the overline denoting the conjugate
spinor ﬁeld ψ(x) := ψ†(x)γ0.
Algebras. An algebra A ≡(A, ·) over K = R or K = C is a K-vector space with a
product · : A × A −→A which is
• associative, (A · B) · C = A · (B · C)
∀A, B, C ∈A,
• distributive, A·(B +C) = A·B +A·C and (B +C)·A = B ·A+C ·A for all
A, B, C ∈A,
• and satisﬁes α(A · B) = (αA) · B = A · (αB)
∀A, B ∈A, α ∈K.
An algebra A is unital if and only if it has a unit, that is, there exists an element
1 ∈A such that 1 · A = A = A · 1 for all A ∈A.
A ∗-algebra is a C-algebra with an involution, that is, a map ∗: A −→A ;
A −→A∗(called “∗-operation”) satisfying
(A + αB)∗= A∗+ α B∗,
(A · B)∗= B∗· A∗
and
(A∗)∗= A ,
for all A, B ∈A , α ∈C.
An algebra isomorphism is a map f : (A1, ·1) −→(A2, ·2), where (Aj, ·j),
j = 1, 2, are algebras,
• which is a vector space isomorphism, that is, f is bijective and linear,

If f is only linear and intertwines the products, then it is called an algebra homo-

write fn(v1, . . . , vn) instead of fn(v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn). If, in addition, such a map is
symmetrical, i.e.,
fn(vπ1 ⊗· · · ⊗vπn) = fn(v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vn)
∀π ∈Sn ,
it suﬃces to know fn for diagonal entries, that is, fn(v ⊗· · · ⊗v) ∀v ∈V. From

The Minkowski space. By Md ≡M we mean the d-dimensional Minkowski space;
we assume d > 2. For x ≡(xμ)μ=0,...,d−1 ∈M we sometimes write x =: (x0, ⃗x) =:
(t, ⃗x). The sign convention for the Minkowski metric reads
g := diag(+, −, . . . , −) .
As usual, the forward and backward light cones are deﬁned by
V+ := {x ∈M


 x2 > 0, x0 > 0} ,
V−:= {x ∈M


 x2 > 0, x0 < 0} ,
(A.1.11)
and V + and V −are the closures of these open sets. The relevant symmetry groups
of the Minkowski space are L↑
+, which is the proper, orthochronous Lorentz group,
and P↑
+, which is the pertinent Poincar´e group. For Epstein–Glaser renormaliza-
tion, the thin diagonal in Mn, which is deﬁned as
Δn := { (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Mn

plays an important role.
In four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime the Integral Theorem of Gauss

the inﬁnitesimal surface element dσ is a timelike vector:
dσμ(x) = nμ(x) d˜σ(x)
with
nμ(x) nμ(x) = 1
and a Euclidean, scalar surface element d˜σ(x). A simple example is the family of
surfaces x0 = constant, for which we get
dσ = (±1, 0, 0, 0) dx1 dx2 dx3 .
Function spaces and distributions. We frequently use the shorthand notation
C := C∞(M, R) ≡C∞(Rd, R) .
(A.1.14)
In view of the generalization to curved spacetimes our test function space is usually
D(Ω) ≡D(Ω, C), where Ω is an open subset of Mn (n ∈N∗), frequently we have

A.1. Some notations and a few mathematical preliminaries
467
Ω = Mn. D(Ω) is the space of all smooth functions f ∈C∞(Ω, C), whose support
is compact (with respect to the Euclidean norm of Rdn) and is a subset of Ω. For
the deﬁnition of the topology of the function space D(Ω), we refer to the literature,
e.g., [141].
The relation D(Ω) ⊆D(Mn) (for Ω ⊆Mn) is reversed for the corresponding
spaces of distributions: D′(Mn) ⊆D′(Ω). For the application of a distribution
t ∈D′(Ω) to a test function g ∈D(Ω) we use several notations
t(g) ≡⟨t, g⟩≡

t(x), g(x)

x ≡
	
Ω
ddnx t(x) g(x) ∈C .
Convergence of a sequence of distributions is understood with respect to the weak
topology, that is, for tn, t ∈D′(Ω) (or S′(Mn), introduced below) we deﬁne

The support supp t of a distribution t ∈D′(Ω) is deﬁned to be the smallest
closed set K(⊆Ω) such that t


D(Ω\K) = 0. For example, supp ∂aδ(n) = {0} for
any a ∈Nn, where δ(n) denotes the Dirac delta distribution in Rn.
For Epstein–Glaser renormalization, the following theorem is important: Ev-
ery distribution t ∈D′(Rn) satisfying
supp t ⊆{0}
is a linear combination of derivatives of δ(n):
t =

for some coeﬃcients Ca ∈C.
For a mathematician some notations may be sloppy; in particular, for t ∈
D′(Rn) and an open set Ω ⊂Rn, the statement “t(x) = 0 ∀x ∈Ω” should be read
as “t


D(Ω) = 0”.
Fourier transformation. When using Fourier transformation we work with the
space S(Mn) ≡S(Rdn, C) of smooth and “rapidly decreasing” functions (also called
“Schwartz functions”) and consider the distributions as elements of S′(Mn). For
the deﬁnition of the topology of S(Mn) see any book on Functional Analysis,
e.g., [141].
The Fourier transformation can be deﬁned as a map F : S(Mn) −→S(Mn);
we use the conventions
(Ff)(k) ≡ˆf(k) :=
1
(2π)dn/2
	
ddnx f(x) eikx ,
hence
(F−1f)(k) ≡ˇf(k) = ˆf(−k) ,

Derivatives of a function of functionals. Let H be a map H : F −→F or H :
Floc −→F or H : Floc −→Floc; moreover, F and/or Floc may be replaced by
F[[ℏ, κ]] and/or Floc[[ℏ, κ]], respectively.184 Such a map H is N-times diﬀerentiable
at F ∈F[loc] if and only if

functional to an arbitrary conﬁguration h ∈C, we have traced back diﬀerentiability
of H to diﬀerentiability of a function from R to C – in accordance with (1.2.3). This
recursive deﬁnition of the nth derivative of H at F can be written non-recursively:

by induction on n. With that, we know that the r.h.s. of (A.1.19) is linear in

Shorthand notations for powers and higher partial derivatives. For powers and
higher partial derivatives we introduce a multi-index notation: let a = (a1, . . . , ak)

Propagators: Conventions and properties
To a large extent, this appendix is a summary of deﬁnitions and results given in the
main text. With regard to factors (−1), i and 2π in the deﬁnition of propagators
one ﬁnds various conventions in the literature. We work throughout with the
following deﬁnitions.
• The retarded propagator Δret
m is the retarded Green function of the Klein–
Gordon operator, i.e., it is deﬁned by
(□+ m2)Δret
m (x) = −δ(x)
and
supp Δret
m ⊆V + ;

Δret
m is the propagator of classical retarded ﬁelds:

ϕ(y), ϕ(x)

= −Δret
m (x −y) .
• The Jordan–Pauli “function” or “commutator function” is deﬁned by
Δm(x) := Δret
m (x) −Δret
m (−x) =
−i
(2π)d−1
	
ddp sgn p0 δ(p2 −m2) e−ipx
(A.2.3)
(the momentum integral representation is obtained by inserting (A.2.2) and
using (A.1.16)). Besides the mathematical properties
Δm(−x) = −Δm(x) ,
(□+ m2)Δm(x) = 0 ,
supp Δm ⊆(V + ∪V −)
and
Δm(x) θ(x0) = Δret
m (x) ,
(A.2.4)
it is the propagator of the Poisson bracket:
1
iℏ[ϕ(x), ϕ(y)]⋆= {ϕ(x), ϕ(y)} = Δm(x −y) .
• The Wightman two-point function is the “positive frequency part of iΔm”,
that is,
Δ+
m(x) :=
1
(2π)d−1
	
ddp θ(p0) δ(p2 −m2) e−ipx .
(A.2.5)
It fulﬁlls
(□+ m2)Δ+
m(x) = 0 .
Δ+
m is a possible propagator of the star product:
ω0

ϕ(x) ⋆ϕ(y)

= ℏΔ+
m(x −y) ;
(A.2.6)
a necessary condition for that is the property
−i

Δ+
m(x) −Δ+
m(−x)

= Δm(x) .
(A.2.7)
Obviously, if x2 < 0 then Δ+
m(−x) = Δ+
m(x), but this is wrong for x2 ≥0.
• The Feynman propagator is deﬁned by
ΔF
m(x) := θ(x0) Δ+
m(x) + θ(−x0) Δ+
m(−x) .

and
ρd−2 pρ−1m(ρx) = pm(x) for all ρ > 0 .
The wave front sets of Δm, Δ+
m, ΔF
m and Δret are given in (1.8.9), (2.2.7) and
(A.3.5)–(A.3.6), respectively.
The corresponding propagators for a massless scalar ﬁeld are obtained by
the limit m ↓0:
p0(x) = lim
m↓0 pm(x) ,
p = Δret, Δ, Δ+, ΔF .
All deﬁnitions and properties given in this appendix are maintained in this limit –
one may simply set m = 0 in these formulas. Instead of Δret

usually writes Dret, D, D+ and DF , respectively. For d = 4 the x-space formulas
for the massless propagators read:
Dret(x) = −1

where S·
m := Sm, Δ·
m := Δm, details are given in Sect. 5.1.1. Here, we only point
out some crucial diﬀerences between scalar and spinor propagators: For a scalar
ﬁeld the “advanced propagator”, Δav
m, and the “negative frequency part of iΔm”,
Δ−
m, are deﬁned in terms of Δret
m and Δ+
m, respectively, by the simple formulas
Δav
m (x) := Δret
m (−x) ;
Δ−
m(x) := −Δ+
m(−x) ;
(A.2.12)
however, for a Dirac spinor ﬁeld the corresponding deﬁnitions read:
Sav
m (x) := (i/∂x + m) Δav
m(x) ̸= Sret
m (−x)
S−
m(x) := (i/∂x + m)Δ−
m(x) ̸= −S+
m(−x) .
(A.2.13)
We also emphasize that
Sm(−x) ̸= −Sm(x)
and
SF
m(−x) ̸= SF
m(x) .
Exercise A.2.2 (Equal-time commutation relations).

Δm(0, ⃗x) = 0 ,
∂kΔm(0, ⃗x) = 0
(for k = 1, . . . , d −1) ,

(∂0)2Δm(0, ⃗x) = 0 ,
(A.2.14)
on a formal level by manipulating the momentum space integral representation
(A.2.3).
Hence, interpreting π(t, ⃗x) := ∂tϕ(t, ⃗x) as canonical conjugate momentum of ϕ(t, ⃗x),
the equal-time ﬁelds satisfy canonical commutation relations:
[ϕ(t, ⃗x), ϕ(t, ⃗y)]⋆= 0 ,
[ϕ(t, ⃗x), π(t, ⃗y)]⋆= iℏδ(⃗x −⃗y) ,
[π(t, ⃗x), π(t, ⃗y)]⋆= 0 ,
(A.2.15)
see, e.g., [109, Sect. 3-1].
(b) Prove the following: Any solution f ∈C2(M, C) of (□y + m2)f(y) = 0 can be
written as

where the notation (5.5.24) is used. We point out that the formula (A.2.16) yields an
integral representation of the solution of the Cauchy problem for the Klein-Gordon
equation (cf. Thm. 1.6.6).
[Solution: (a) In the formula for Δm (A.2.3) we perform the p0-integral by using

Setting x0 := 0 we get the asserted relations.
(b) First we point out that the region of integration in (A.2.16) is bounded, due to
supp Δm ⊆(V + ∪V −). We denote the r.h.s. of (A.2.16) by gc(y). By means of (□+

Due to this and Gauss’ integral theorem (A.1.13), gc(y) does not depend on c ; hence,
we may choose c = y0. With that and by using the relations (A.2.14), we get
gy0(y) = −

A.3
A short introduction to wave front sets
As references we recommend the books [107] and [141, Volume II] and in particular the
article [21]. It was Radzikowski [140] who realized the usefulness of wave front sets for
the formulation of (Quantum) Field Theory.
The wave front set is a central tool of “microlocal analysis”. The wave front
set of a distribution t ∈D′(Rm) is a characterization of the singularities of t;
which relies on the connection between “smoothness” of a distribution and “rapid
decay” of its Fourier transform in all directions.
To characterize the singularity of a distribution t(x) ∈D′(Rm) at a given
point x0 ∈Rm we have to select from t the behaviour at x0. We do this by replacing
t(x) by (ft)(x) := f(x)t(x) where f runs through all functions f ∈D(Rm) with
f(x0) ̸= 0. Note that the support of f may be an arbitrary small neighbourhood
of x0. Now, if t is singular at x0 (i.e., there does not exist any open neighbourhood
U of x0 such that t restricted to D(U) can be identiﬁed with a smooth function)
and if f belongs to the mentioned class of functions, then ft is still singular at x0
and its support is compact, so that its Fourier transform '
ft is a C∞function.
Since the Fourier transformation is a bijection S(Rm) −→S(Rm), we may
say: Non-smoothness of ft is equivalent to non-rapid decay of '
ft in at least one
direction, for all f of the above kind. Recall that a function g decays rapidly in
the direction k ∈Rm \ {0} if and only if there exists an open cone C containing k
such that
sup
y∈C
|y|N|g(y)| < ∞
for all
N ∈N.

474
Appendix
Motivated by these explanations, we deﬁne:
Deﬁnition A.3.1 (Wave front set). The wave front set WF(t) of a distribution
t ∈D′(Rm) is the set
WF(t) := { (x, k) ∈Rm × (Rm \ {0})



 '
ft does not decay rapidly in direction k,
for all f ∈D(Rm) with f(x) ̸= 0 }.
Obviously, (x, k) ∈WF(t) implies (x, λk) ∈WF(t) for all λ > 0.
The singular support of a distribution t ∈D′(Rm), denoted by sing supp(t),
is the set of points x at which t is singular. As explained above, it is related to the
wave front set of t by
sing supp(t) = { x ∈Rm 

 ∃k ∈Rm \ {0} with (x, k) ∈WF(t) } .
(A.3.1)
Example A.3.2 (Wave front set of the δ-distribution). For t = δ ≡δ(m) ∈D′(Rm), we
know from (A.3.1) that the wave front set is of the form WF(δ) = {0} × (. . .) . Since
(
fδ(k) ∼

dx eikxf(x) δ(x) = f(0) does not decay rapidly in any direction k, we obtain
WF(δ) = {0} × (Rm \ {0}) .
(A.3.2)
We mention some further basic properties of the wave front set. For t, s ∈
D′(Rm) and g ∈C∞(Rm) it holds that
(a) WF(t + s) ⊆WF(t) ∪WF(s) ,
(b) WF(gt) ⊆

supp g × (Rm \ {0})

∩WF(t) .
(c) Let P(x) = 
a ga(x)∂a be a diﬀerential operator, where ga ∈C∞(M) and
the sum over a is ﬁnite. Then, WF(Pt) ⊆WF(t) .
We make these statements plausible by the following explanations:
(a) In the sum t+s there may be cancellations of singularities; therefore, WF(t+
s) may be truly smaller than WF(t) ∪WF(s).
(b) Multiplying a distribution t with a smooth function g, the singularities of t
lying outside the support of g are suppressed.
For a singularity of t at some x0 with g(x0) ̸= 0, the statement is that
{ k ∈(Rm \ {0})


 (x0, k) ∈WF(gt) }
= { k ∈(Rm \ {0})


(x0, k) ∈WF(t) } .
This follows immediately from Deﬁnition A.3.1, since there is a neighbour-
hood U of x0 such that g(x) ̸= 0 ∀x ∈U and, hence,
{

(fg)t

|D(U)


 f ∈D(M), f(x0) ̸= 0 }
= { (ft)|D(U)


 f ∈D(M), f(x0) ̸= 0 } .

A.3. A short introduction to wave front sets
475
(c) Due to the statements (a) and (b), it suﬃces to prove WF(∂μt) ⊆WF(t) ∀t ∈
D′(Rm). Now let (x0, k0) ∈WF(∂μt) and f ∈D(Rm) with f(x0) ̸= 0 .
Writing
(−ikμ) '
ft (k) = 
f∂μt(k) + 
(∂μf)t(k) ,
(A.3.3)
we know that the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. does not decay rapidly in direction
k0. For simplicity we assume that x0 is an isolated singularity, that is, there
is some neighbourhood U of x0 such that t restricted to D(U \ {x0}) is a
smooth function. To show that (x0, k0) ∈WF(t) by means of Deﬁnition
A.3.1, it suﬃces to consider all functions f ∈D(U) with f(x0) ̸= 0
and
x0 ̸∈supp(∂μf). For such an f statement (b) says (∂μf)t ∈C∞(Rm); hence,
the second term on the r.h.s. of (A.3.3) decays rapidly in all directions k.
We conclude that '
ft (k) does not decay rapidly in direction k0, that is,
(x0, k0) ∈WF(t).
An obvious example for WF(Pt) ̸= WF(t) is
WF

(□+ m2)Δ+
m

= WF(0) = ∅̸= WF(Δ+
m) .
As mentioned in (3.1.1), a fundamental technical diﬃculty in QFT is that in
general the pointwise product t(x)s(x) of distributions t, s ∈D′(Rm) does not
exist, if t and s have an “overlapping singularity”, i.e., if there exists an x0 ∈Rm
such that both t and s are singular at x0. Nevertheless, t(x)s(x) exists in this case,
if the following criterion is satisﬁed.
Theorem A.3.3 (H¨ormander’s criterion [107]). Let t, s ∈D′(Rm). Suppose that
WF(t) ⊕WF(s) := {(x, k1 + k2)


 (x, k1) ∈WF(t) ∧(x, k2) ∈WF(s)}
does not contain any element of the form (x, 0). Then the pointwise product ts ∈
D′(Rm) is well deﬁned and
WF(ts) ⊆

WF(t) ∪WF(s) ∪

WF(t) ⊕WF(s)

.
Heuristic explanation for the existence of t(x)s(x). Let t and s both be singular
at some point x0. Take f ∈D(Rm), f(x0) ̸= 0 and, for simplicity, assume that
ft and fs have only one overlapping singularity, namely at x0. In general, the
product ft(x) fs(x) does not exist since the integral

dk '
ft (p−k) '
fs (k) diverges.
However, if the assumption of the theorem is satisﬁed, we see that (x0, k) ∈WF(s)
implies (x0, −k) /∈WF(t); so there exists an f with the above-mentioned properties
such that the integral does converge, hence (ft)(x) (fs)(x) ∈D′(Rm) exists for
this f in the distributional sense.

Perturbative QFT based on quantization
with a Hadamard function
This appendix is based on reference [55].
For brevity we assume that the spacetime dimension is d = 4, in odd dimen-
sions there are crucial diﬀerences as explained at the end of Sect. 2.2.
A main diﬃculty of QFT in presence of an external (i.e., non-quantized)
ﬁeld – this may be a gravitational background (i.e., QFT on curved spacetimes)
or, e.g., QED with an external electromagnetic ﬁeld – is that in general there
does not exist a unique vacuum state. Instead one usually works with a family of
so-called “Hadamard states”, which are uniquely determined by their two-point
function – a “Hadamard function”.
In this appendix we study perturbative QFT based on quantization with a
Hadamard function in Minkowski spacetime. The retarded propagator Δret
m (A.2.1)
and the commutator function Δm (A.2.3) are unchanged; but the Wightman two-
point function Δ+
m is replace by a Hadamard function Hμ
m (introduced in Sect. 2.2),
which is non-unique: The mass parameter μ > 0 is arbitrary. We recall some basic
properties of Hμ
m making it possible to use Hμ
m as propagator of the star product:
−i

Hμ

Hμ
m(x) = Hμ
m(−x) .
(A.4.2)
The equivalence of the corresponding star products ⋆m,μ := ⋆Hμ
m, for diﬀerent
values of μ, is shown in Sect. 2.3.
Axioms for the retarded product. The axioms for perturbative QFT, given in
Sect. 3.1 can be modiﬁed as follows: Since Hμ
m is smooth in m ≥0 (2.2.14), the Sm-
expansion axiom is replaced by two axioms requiring smoothness of the retarded
products in m ≥0 and almost homogeneous behaviour under the scaling (X, m) →
(ρX, m/ρ) (where X := (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Mn denotes the spacetime arguments of the
R-product, see (3.1.66)). This simpliﬁes the Sm-expansion to the Taylor expansion
in m. However, there is the complication that Hμ
m is non-unique; to take this into
account we require in an additional axiom that the retarded products transform
under a change of μ in the same way as the star product ⋆m,μ does.
Let us explain the modiﬁcations in detail. For the basic axioms there is only
a change in the GLZ-relation: The commutator is now meant with respect to the
star product ⋆m,μ. Turning to the renormalization conditions, the Sm-expansion
axiom is replaced by the following three axioms:
• Smoothness in the mass m ≥0: We require that
0 ≤m −→(FS)Hμ
m ≡RHμ
m

be smooth, for each
S, F ∈Floc .
(A.4.3)

A.4. Perturbative QFT based on quantization with a Hadamard function
479
This excludes the Wightman two-point function Δ+
m. Instead, we must take a
Hadamard function Hμ
m with the additional mass parameter μ > 0. We shall write
R(m,μ)
n−1,1 , r(m,μ)
n−1,1 := ω0(R(m,μ)
n−1,1) etc. to indicate that we are using Hμ
m.
Turning to the scaling behaviour, we ﬁrst remark that
ρ2Hμ/ρ
m/ρ(ρx) = Hμ
m(x) ,
as we see from (2.2.13) and (2.2.9); from this relation one derives that
σρ(σ−1
ρ F1 ⋆m/ρ,μ/ρ · · · ⋆m/ρ,μ/ρ σ−1
ρ Fn) = F1 ⋆m,μ · · · ⋆m,μ Fn
(A.4.4)
by proceeding analogously to part (a) of Exer. 3.1.21. However, the relevant scaling
transformation leaves μ unchanged; but under (x, m) →(ρx, m/ρ) a Hadamard
function Hμ
m(x) behaves only almost homogeneously, see (2.2.15). From that for-
mula we conclude that
σρ(σ−1

ρ Fn) = F1 ⋆m,μ · · · ⋆m,μ Fn +
N

k=1
(Lk logk ρ (A.4.5)
for some (Lk ∈F, which do not depend on ρ, and some N < ∞; this conclu-
sion is analogous to the derivation of (A.4.4).185 Taking into account additionally
that, as a consequence of the basic axioms, the unrenormalized R(m,μ)-product is
an iterated, retarded commutator with respect to ⋆m,μ (that is, formula (3.1.69)
holds true on D( ˇMn+1) (3.1.68) for R(m,μ) on the l.h.s. and ⋆m,μ on the r.h.s.),
we conclude that the unrenormalized R(m,μ)-product fulﬁlls the scaling relation
(A.4.6) given below. Since almost homogeneous scaling can be maintained in the
extension of distributions (Proposition 3.2.16), we may require (A.4.6) also for the
renormalized R(m,μ)-product.
• Scaling: For all F1, . . . , Fn ∈Floc, there exist m- and μ-dependent functionals
L(m,μ)

n−1,1(F1 ⊗· · ·⊗Fn)+
N

k=1
L(m,μ)

(A.4.6)
for some N < ∞.
The three sentences directly after (3.1.67) are appropriate also here.
Finally we study the μ-dependence. Arguing analogously to the scaling be-
haviour, we conclude from the “μ-covariance” of the ⋆m,μ-product, given in (2.3.6)
(Exer. 2.3.2), and the formula for the unrenormalized R(m,μ)-product (3.1.69), that
the latter behaves under a change of μ according to formula (A.4.7) below; hence
we require (A.4.7) also for the renormalized R(m,μ)-product.
185Alternatively, one can also argue as follows: Due to (A.4.4), the l.h.s. of (A.4.5) is equal to
F1 ⋆m,ρμ · · · ⋆m,ρμ Fn and then one uses that Hρμ
m −Hμ
m ∼log ρ.

Therefore, from a retarded product R(m,μ) based on quantization with Hμ

(A.4.8)
By deﬁnition, the so-obtained R(m,m) satisﬁes the axioms given here, i.e., the
axioms with respect to the star product ⋆Hμ
m (with m = μ), in particular the GLZ
relation with respect to ⋆Hm
m = ⋆Δ+
m. Hence, R(m,m) satisﬁes the axioms for R(m)
given in Sect. 3.1 – this is obvious, except for the validity of the Sm-expansion
axiom.
To illustrate the relation (A.4.8), we study the example of the setting sun
diagram. The unrenormalized retarded product r(m,μ) 0(ϕ3, ϕ3) ∈D′(R4\{0}) can
be computed similarly to Sect. 3.1.2:
r(m,μ) 0(ϕ3, ϕ3)(z) = 6ℏ3

where
dμ

is, the extensions r(m,m)(ϕ3, ϕ3), r(m,μ)(ϕ3, ϕ3), r(m,μ)(ϕ2, ϕ2) ∈D′(R4) must
also satisfy (A.4.10).

A.4. Perturbative QFT based on quantization with a Hadamard function
481
The axioms for the time-ordered product, given in Sect. 3.3, are modiﬁed
accordingly. In particular, in the Causality axiom the causal factorization is now
meant with respect to the star product ⋆m,μ. Hence, the Feynman propagator is
replaced by
Hμ,F
m (x) := θ(x0) Hμ
m(x) + θ(−x0) Hμ
m(−x) ,
(A.4.11)
where μ > 0 is arbitrary. Also in the Bogoliubov formula (3.3.30), it is now the
star product ⋆m,μ which is used.
Construction of the retarded product. The inductive construction given elabo-
rately in Sect. 3.2 has to be modiﬁed as follows – we only explain the changes:
• The Sm-expansion is replaced by the Taylor expansion in m. In detail,
Sect. 3.2.3 is replaced by the following: Let A1, . . . , An ∈Phom. By induction
we know that the totally symmetric part s(m) 0 := s(m,μ) 0
n
(A1, . . . , An) ∈
D′(R4(n−1) \ {0}) of r(m,μ) 0
n−1,1 (A1, . . . , An), which is deﬁned analogously to
(3.2.50), is smooth in m ≥0 and scales almost homogeneously:
(ρ ∂ρ)N+1#
ρDs(m/ρ) 0(ρy)
$
= 0
for some N ∈N, where
D :=
n

j=1
dim Aj
(A.4.12)
is a natural number. We now seek an extension s(m) ∈D′(R4(n−1)) of s(m) 0
fulﬁlling the same properties, with the same D but N may be replaced by
N + 1.
If m = 0, we can apply Proposition 3.2.16 directly, since there is no
scaling in the mass.
On the other hand, if m > 0, due to the smoothness in m we can make
a Taylor expansion:
s(m) 0(y) =
D−4(n−1)

l=0
ml
l! u0
l (y) + mD−4(n−1)+1s(m) 0

Diﬀerentiating Equation (A.4.12), we get

(ρ ∂ρ)N+2#
ρD−l ul(ρy)
$

Combining (A.4.12), (A.4.13) and (A.4.14), we get
(ρ ∂ρ)N+1#
ρ4(n−1)−1 s(m/ρ) 0

red (ρy) = 0 ,
i.e.,
sd(s(m) 0

Due to that, Theorem 3.2.8(a) provides a unique extension s(m)
red with sd(s(m)

= sd(s(m) 0
red
) by the direct extension (3.2.22). The latter maintains smoothness
in m ≥0. And, s(m)
red also fulﬁlls the scaling relation (A.4.15); this can be seen
as follows:
t(m)
ρ
(y) := (ρ ∂ρ)N+1#
ρ4(n−1)−1 s(m/ρ)

hence, according to (A.1.17), it is of the form
t(m)

ρ,a ∂aδ(4(n−1))(y)
for some C(m)
ρ,a ∈C.
In addition, for each ﬁxed ρ > 0, we obtain sd(t(m)
ρ
) < 4(n −1) since
sd(s(m)
red ) < 4(n −1); these results imply t(m)
ρ
= 0.
Putting it all together, we arrive at
s(m,μ)

(A.4.18)
which is an extension of s(m,μ) 0
n
(A1, . . . , An) with the desired smoothness
and scaling properties.
• To fulﬁll the μ-covariance (A.4.7) we can proceed as follows: First we con-
struct the extension S(m,μ1)
n
of S(m,μ1) 0
n
for a ﬁxed μ1. For arbitrary μ,
the extension S(m,μ)
n
is then obtained by μ-covariance, that is, by the re-
lation (A.4.7) with S(m,μ)
n
in place of R(m,μ)
n−1,1. One veriﬁes that the validity
of the other renormalization conditions goes over from S(m,μ1)
n
to the so-
constructed S(m,μ)
n
.
• The most general solution of the axioms can be described as follows: Let
R(m,μ)
n−1,1 and R(m,μ)
n−1,1 be two solutions of the inductive step (n−2) →(n−1) and

mutations of the pairs (A1, x1), . . . , (An, xn) and M is a ﬁxed mass param-
eter, which must be introduced for the renormalization of the massless the-
ory. (Remember that the latter does not contain the scale μ > 0, since
limm↓0 Hμ
m = D+; so it is unnatural to take μ as renormalization mass scale
for the m = 0 theory.) The appearance of M has the consequence that the
dimensionless numbers Cl,a may depend on μ (via μ/M); this corrects an
oversight in [55]. The requirement that l ≥0 comes from smoothness in m
(via the factor ml).
We point out that Cl,a is independent of m – in contrast to (3.2.71),
powers of log(m/μ) or log(m/M) do not appear in Cl,a since they would
violate smoothness in m ≥0. Due to this, the r.h.s. of (A.4.19) scales ho-
mogeneously under (X, m) →(ρX, m/ρ), although R(m,μ)

St¨uckelberg–Petermann renormalization group. As for quantization with Δ+
m, the
St¨uckelberg–Petermann renormalization group R is deﬁned such that it is precisely
the set of maps Z : Floc −→Floc relating diﬀerent T (m,μ)-products by the Main
Theorem (Thm. 3.6.3). This gives the following modiﬁcations of the explicit def-
inition of R (Deﬁnition 3.6.1): The analytic maps Z ∈R depend now on both
parameters m and μ of the underlying star product: Z ≡Z(m,μ). The deﬁning
property “(3) Locality, Translation covariance and Sm-expansion” is replaced by
the following two properties (3a) and (3b):

484
Appendix
The deﬁning property (3a) can be understood as follows: From the proof of the
Main Theorem, more precisely from formula (3.6.28), we know that Z(n)
(m,μ) is the
diﬀerence of two time-ordered products of nth order which agree to lower orders
(3.6.29). Therefore, z(n)
(m,μ)(A1, . . .) (where A1, . . . ∈Phom) is of the from of the
r.h.s. of (A.4.19). From the explanation after (A.4.19) it follows that z(n)
(m,μ) may
depend on μ and, hence, this holds also for Z(n)
(m,μ) – this corrects [55, Thm. 4.2(iii)].
Remark A.4.2. The deﬁning property (3a) can more elegantly be formulated in
terms of Z(m,μ) by the four properties:
• Locality, given in formula (3.6.33);
• Translation covariance: βa ◦Z(m,μ) = Z(m,μ) ◦βa
∀a ∈R4;
• Smoothness in m ≥0 of Z ≡Z(m,μ) in the sense of (A.4.3);
• Scaling: σρ ◦Z(m/ρ,μ) ◦σ−1
ρ
= Z(m,μ).
We point out: The elements Z(m,μ) of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann group appearing
here, scale homogeneously under (X, m) →(ρX, m/ρ). This is in contrast to the
elements Z(m) of the St¨uckelberg–Petermann group relying on Δ+
m, which scale
only almost homogeneously; see186 (3.6.15).
Chap. 4 about the MWI can be translated into quantization based on a
Hadamard function Hμ
m without any obstacle, see [16]; a main reason for this is
that also Hμ
m is a solution of the Klein–Gordon equation.
A.5
The Fock space
Almost every introductory book to QFT treats the Fock space, however there are diﬀerent
conventions. Essentially we follow [73].
The Fock space is a Hilbert space, on which our on-shell ﬁelds F


C0, F ∈F
can faithfully be represented, see Thm. 2.6.3. The normalized Fock space vectors
are interpreted as vector states in the sense of (2.5.4). A main advantage of the
Fock space description of physical states is that it provides a clear particle number
interpretation for free ﬁeld theories, in particular for the asymptotic states in a
scattering experiment, see (2.6.11), (5.5.37) and (A.5.25). Hence, the Fock space
186By means of the tools introduced in this appendix, the relation (3.6.15) can be derived in an
alternative way: Using that Z(m) and Z(m,μ) are related by Z(m) := Z(m,m) (see Remk. A.4.1)
and applying the properties “Scaling” and “μ-covariance” of Z(m,μ), we obtain
σρ ◦Z(m/ρ) ◦σ−1
ρ
= σρ ◦Z(m/ρ,m/ρ) ◦σ−1
ρ
= Z(m,m/ρ) = ρ−Γ ◦Z(m,m) ◦ρΓ = ρ−Γ ◦Z(m) ◦ρΓ .
Now, for G ∈F, the term ρΓG is a polynomial in log ρ, since by deﬁnition G is a polynomial in
(∂a)ϕ, i.e., of ﬁnite order in ϕ. Therefore, ρ−Γ ◦Z(n)
(m)

(ρΓF )⊗n
is a polynomial in log ρ for all
F ∈Floc , n ∈N∗.

A.5. The Fock space
485
is well suited for scattering processes in high energy physics, in which particles are
created and annihilated.
We give a short and self-contained introduction to the bosonic Fock space,
and at the end we sketch how one has to change this construction to obtain the
fermionic Fock space.
Deﬁnition of the bosonic Fock space. Let M∗≡M∗
d be the momentum space
belonging to the Minkowski space Md, that is M∗
d := Rd and p2 := (p0)2 −⃗p 2 for
p = (p0, ⃗p) ∈M∗. We equip the mass shell
H+
m := { p = (p0, ⃗p) ∈M∗


 p2 = m2 , p0 > 0 } ,
m > 0 ,
with the Lorentz invariant (more precisely: L↑
+ invariant) measure
dd−1⃗p
2ω⃗p
where
ω⃗p :=

⃗p 2 + m2 ;
(A.5.1)
Lorentz invariance follows from
	
ddp θ(p0) δ(p2 −m2) f(p0, ⃗p) =
	 dd−1⃗p
2ω⃗p
f(ω⃗p, ⃗p)
∀f ∈D(Rd) .
For simplicity we study the massive, real scalar ﬁeld, that is, a relativistic
particle with spin 0 and mass m > 0. The pertinent 1-particle space is

φ(ω⃗pπ1, ⃗pπ1, . . . , ω⃗pπn, ⃗pπn) = φ(ω⃗p1, ⃗p1, . . . , ω⃗pn, ⃗pn)
∀π ∈Sn .
With the given L2-scalar product, each H+
n is a Hilbert space.

The vector
Ω := (1, 0, 0, 0, . . .) ∈F+
(A.5.6)
is the “vacuum vector”, it describes a state with zero particles. The particle number
operator N is deﬁned by188
(Nφ)n := n φn
for
φ ≡(φn) ∈F+ .
(A.5.7)
Obviously, N is symmetric: ⟨φ, Nψ⟩F+ = ⟨Nφ, ψ⟩F+ for all φ, ψ in the domain of
N. A normalized eigenvector,
φ = (0, . . . , 0, φn, 0, . . .)
with
∥φn∥H+
n = 1 ,
describes a state with n particles.
Creation- and annihilation operators; the free, real scalar ﬁeld. An operator which
changes the particle number is the “annihilation operator” a(f), which annihilates
a particle with wave function f ∈H1; it is deﬁned by:

a(f)φ

n(p1, . . . , pn) :=
√
n + 1 ℏ
	 dd−1⃗p
2ω⃗p
f(p) φn+1(p, p1, . . . , pn) ;
(A.5.8)
here and in the following we use the notation
p := (ω⃗p, ⃗p) , pj := (ω⃗pj, ⃗pj) .
The adjoint operator, a(f)∗is a “creation operator”; as we will see, it creates a
particle with wave function f ∈H1. By inserting the above deﬁnitions into

ψ , a(f)∗φ

F+ :=

187In contrast to the inﬁnite direct sum of vector spaces (cf. the comment to formula (A.1.5)),
the inﬁnite direct sum of Hilbert spaces may contain sequences (φn)n∈N for which inﬁnitely many
φn are non-vanishing; an example is given by the coherent states (treated in Exer. (A.5.3)).
188Most of the Fock space operators we introduce are unbounded operators, e.g., N, the anni-
hilation and creation operators a(f), a(f)∗, (see (A.5.8) and (A.5.9) below) and the free ﬁeld
ϕop(g) =

dx ϕop(x) g(x) (with g ∈D(M)) (A.5.17); we omit a study of the pertinent domains.

a(f) Ω = 0 ,
a(f)∗Ω = (0, f, 0, 0, . . .) ,
∀f ∈H1 .
(A.5.10)
Obviously it holds that
[N , a(f)] = −a(f) ,
[N , a(f)∗] = a(f)∗,
(A.5.11)
which also shows that a(f) (a(f)∗respectively) lowers (increases resp.) the particle
number by 1. By direct calculation we get the important commutation relations
[a(f) , a(g)∗] = ⟨f, g⟩H1 = ℏ

[a(f) , a(g)] = 0 ,
[a∗(f) , a(g)∗] = 0 ,

(A.5.12)
For ∥f∥H1 = 1, the operator a(f)∗a(f) can be interpreted as “number of particles
with wave function f ”, because
[a(f)∗a(f) , a(f)] = −a(f) ,
[a(f)∗a(f) , a(f)∗] = a(f)∗
and
[a(f)∗a(f) , a(g)] = 0 = [a(f)∗a(f) , a(g)∗]
if
⟨f, g⟩H1 = 0 ;
(A.5.13)
these relations follow immediately from (A.5.12) by using [a(f),a(f)∗]=∥f∥2

they can be interpreted as operator-valued “distributions” – we put quotation
marks, because a(p) : f −→a(f) is antilinear and the “test functions” f are
elements of H1. The commutation relations (A.5.12) translate into
[a(p) , a∗(q)] = ℏ2ω⃗p δ(d−1)(⃗p −⃗q) ,
[a(p) , a(q)] = 0 ,
[a∗(p) , a∗(q)] = 0 .

where L(F+) denotes the set of linear operators on F+. The
commutation relations (A.5.14) are equivalent to
[a(x) , a∗(y)] = ℏΔ+
m(x −y) ,
[a(x) , a(y)] = 0 ,
[a∗(x) , a∗(y)] = 0 , (A.5.16)
with the Wightman two-point function (2.2.1) or (A.2.5), as we obtain by inserting
the deﬁnitions (A.5.15).
Obviously, a(x) and a∗(x) solve the Klein–Gordon equation,
(□x + m2)a(x) = 0 ,
(□x + m2)a∗(x) = 0 ;
hence this holds also for the free, real scalar ﬁeld on F+, which is deﬁned by
ϕop(x) := a(x) + a∗(x) ∈D′

The normally ordered product. Powers of the free ﬁeld ϕop(x) do not exist – this
is not a surprise, since ϕop(x) is an operator-valued distribution. For example,
trying to compute ϕop(x)2, we would obtain

Ω , ϕop(x)2 Ω

F+ = ℏΔ+
m(0) = ∞.
(A.5.20)
This is the main motivation to introduce the normally ordered product (also called
“Wick product”) :ϕop(x1) · · · ϕop(xn): , with respect to which powers of ϕop(x)
exist, as we explain below. It is deﬁned by:

that is, all factors ϕop(xj) are splitted into creation and annihilation operators
and the annihilation operators are put on the right-hand side of the creation
operators. For n = 1, we get :ϕop(x): = ϕop(x). The normally ordered product of
:ϕop(x1) · · · ϕop(xn): and :ϕop(xn+1) · · · ϕop(xn+k): is deﬁned to be

By requiring bilinearity, the latter deﬁnition is extended to “Wick polynomials”,
that is, linear combinations of terms of the form (A.5.21). In terms of smeared
Wick polynomials 
n⟨fn , :ϕop ⊗n:⟩, where the sum is ﬁnite and fn is as in Deﬁ-
nition 1.2.1, the deﬁnition (A.5.22) reads

Obviously, the normally ordered product is commutative and associative.
From a(x)Ω = 0 we conclude
:ϕop(x1) · · · ϕop(xn): Ω = a∗(x1) · · · a∗(xn) Ω ;
(A.5.24)
taking into account also [N, a∗(x)] = a∗(x) and N Ω = 0, we obtain
N :ϕop(f1) · · · ϕop(fn): Ω = n :ϕop(f1) · · · ϕop(fn): Ω ,
(A.5.25)
where f1, . . . , fn ∈D(M) and ϕop(f) :=

(A.5.27)
Deﬁning ei ϕop(f) in analogy to (A.5.26) by replacing the normally ordered product
by the operator product, there appears a signiﬁcant diﬀerence: The formal power

The following theorem is very important for Fock space computations in practice.

Theorem A.5.1 (Wick’s Theorem in terms of generating functionals). The nor-
mally ordered product is related to the symmetrized operator product by
:ei ϕop(f): = ei ϕop(f) e
ℏ
2 Δ+
m(f,f) ,
(A.5.29)
where
Δ+
m(f, g) :=
	
dx dy f(x) Δ+
m(x −y) g(y) .
The operator product of two normally ordered products can be expanded in normally
ordered products by means of
:ei ϕop(f): :ei ϕop(g): = :ei ϕop(f+g): e−ℏΔ+
m(f,g) .
(A.5.30)
Proof. The ﬁrst assertion (A.5.29) can be obtained from the Baker–Campbell–
Hausdorﬀformula for formal power series,
eA eB = eA+B e
1
2 [A,B]
if [A, B] is a C-number,
(A.5.31)
by setting A := i  dx a∗(x) f(x) , B := i  dx a(x) f(x) and by using the com-
mutation relation (A.5.16) and
:ei ϕop(f): = :ei

dx (a(x)+a∗(x)) f(x): = ei

dx a∗(x) f(x) ei

dx a(x) f(x) ;
the latter formula is an immediate consequence of the deﬁnition of the normally
ordered product (A.5.21).
To derive the second assertion (A.5.30), we proceed as follows: By using
(A.5.29) for both :ei ϕop(f): and :ei ϕop(g): we get
:ei ϕop(f): :ei ϕop(g): = ei ϕop(f) ei ϕop(g) e
ℏ
2

Δ+
m(f,f)+Δ+
m(g,g)

.
Now we apply the identity (A.5.31) for A := i ϕop(f), B := i ϕop(g) and the
commutation relation (A.5.18):
= ei ϕop(f+g) e
ℏ
2

−Δ+
m(f,g)+Δ+
m(g,f)+Δ+
m(f,f)+Δ+

next we use again (A.5.29), however now for :ei ϕop(f+g):, and ﬁnally we simplify
the result

for l = 2 = k we get

where n := n1 + · · · + nk. Due to Theorem 2.6.3 and (2.6.7), this deﬁnition of the
Wightman function agrees with the one given in Exer. 2.5.4. From that exercise we

492
Appendix
know that Wn(x11, . . . , xknk) vanishes if n is odd, and for n even it is the sum over
all possibilities to contract all the ﬁelds ϕop(x11), . . . , ϕop(xknk) (n/2 contractions
in each term). Hence, contractions of both types
(a) Δ+
m(xjr −xls) with 1 ≤j < l ≤k, and
(b) Δ+
m(xjr −xjs) with 1 ≤r < s ≤nj
appear.
Computing the expression (A.5.36), there is a crucial diﬀerence: By iterated
use of Wick’s Theorem in the form (A.5.33), we obtain the sum over all possible
contractions of type (a), but no contractions of type (b). Therefore, restricting
the normally ordered products :ϕop(xj1) · · · ϕop(xjnj ): to coinciding points, by
performing the limit
xjr →xj1
∀2 ≤r ≤nj , 1 ≤j ≤k ,
divergent “self-contractions” Δ+
m(0) (“tadpole diagrams”) do not appear.
Remark A.5.2. It is instructive to explain the diﬀerence between (A.5.36) and the
Wightman function (A.5.37) by elementary computations. The Wightman function
can be computed by generalizing the procedure in (A.5.19): Inserting ϕop(xjr) =
a(xjr) + a∗(xjr) for all (j, r) and multiplying out, Wn(x11, . . . , xknk) becomes a
sum of terms of the form

Ω, a(x11) · · · a∗(xknk) Ω

. Only terms with n/2 creation-
and n/2 annihilation operators can contribute. Then, in each term the annihilation
operator farthest right is commuted further to the right until it hits Ω, which gives
zero. Every commutator [a(xjr), a∗(xls)] is a contraction Δ+
m(xjr−xls), both types
(a) and (b) appear. This procedure is iterated until all operators a(xjr), a∗(xls)
are commuted away.
Computing analogously the expression (A.5.36), solely contractions of type
(a) appear, because all a(xjr) are already to the right of all a∗(xjs) (s ̸= r), due
to the normal ordering (A.5.21).

The quantization of the free photon ﬁeld in the bosonic Fock space can be
found, e.g., in [109, Sect. 3-2] or [148, Sect. 2.11].
The fermionic Fock space. Fermionic particles (such as all leptons and all quarks
or composite particles as, e.g., the proton and the neutron) satisfy Pauli’s exclusion
principle and obey Fermi statistics. Usually their spin has an half-integer value, s ∈
1
2 (2N + 1), an exception are the Faddeev–Popov ghosts introduced in Sect. 5.1.2.
To construct the Fock space describing a certain species of fermionic particles
(mostly a particle-antiparticle pair as, e.g., for the Dirac spinor ﬁeld) with mass
m > 0 and spin s, let H−
n be the pertinent n-particle space. H−
n is a Hilbert space,
its elements are totally antisymmetric wave functions φ: (H+
m)×n −→H(s)
n , where
H(s)
n
is a suitable Hilbert space depending on n and s. Similarly to (A.5.3), the
scalar product in H−
n (n ∈N∗) is a kind of L2-scalar product, for the explicit
deﬁnitions we refer, e.g., to [73].
The fermionic Fock space is the inﬁnite direct sum of the Hilbert spaces H−
n :
F−:=

H−
0 := C .
(A.5.44)
Deﬁning the scalar product as in (A.5.5), F−is also a Hilbert space. The deﬁnition
of the particle number operator N (A.5.7) can directly be adopted to the fermionic
Fock space and, hence, we have the same particle number interpretation. Again,
N is symmetric.
Writing the deﬁnition of the bosonic annihilation operator (A.5.8) as a H+
1
scalar product, this deﬁnition applies also to the fermionic Fock space:

ble to interpret H+
m ∋p −→φn+1(p, p1, . . . , pn) as an element of H−
1 , for ﬁxed
(p1, . . . , pn) ∈(H+
m)×n.

Again, the adjoint operator a(f)∗is a creation operator: a(f) and a(f)∗
annihilate or create, respectively, a particle with wave function f; in particular
they have the properties (A.5.10) and (A.5.11). One veriﬁes the anticommutation
relations190
[a(f) , a(g)∗]+ = ⟨f, g⟩H−
1 ,
[a(f) , a(g)]+ = 0 ,
[a∗(f) , a(g)∗]+ = 0 (A.5.46)
for all f, g ∈H−
1 .
For ∥f∥H−
1 = 1, the operator a(f)∗a(f) satisﬁes again the relations (A.5.13);
hence it can again be interpreted as “number of particles with wave function f ”.
Because of Fermi statistics, a(f)∗a(f) has only the eigenvalues 0 and 1; mathe-
matically this result can be derived form the anticommutation relations (A.5.46)
in the following way:

a(f)∗a(f)
2 = a(f)∗a(f)a(f)∗a(f)
= a(f)∗[a(f), a(f)∗]+ a(f) −a(f)∗a(f)∗a(f)a(f)
= a(f)∗a(f) ,
since [a(f), a(f)∗]+ = ∥f∥2
H−
1 = 1 and

a(f)
2 = 1
2 [a(f), a(f)]+ = 0.
The quantization of free Dirac spinors in the fermionic Fock space can be
found, e.g., in [148, Sect. 2.2], [109, Sect. 3-3] or [73, Sects. III.3], and for the free
Faddeev–Popov ghosts ﬁelds we refer to [149, Sect. 1.2].

Weak adiabatic limit: Wightman- and
Green functions
References for the weak adiabatic limit are [66, Sect. 8.2], [9] and [38]; for the strong
adiabatic limit, which we do not treat in this book, we refer to [67]. In some parts of this
appendix we assume that the reader is familiar with the Wightman axioms [162] and
with the Gell-Mann–Low formula for the Green function of interacting ﬁelds [81].
Weak adiabatic limit. A main characteristics of causal perturbation theory is that
the coupling constant is adiabatically switched oﬀ: κ is replaced by κg(x) with
g ∈D(M). To make contact to traditional approaches to pQFT, we have to remove
this IR-regularization, we have to perform the adiabatic limit g(x) →1 in some
form; cf. Sect. 3.7. In this appendix we study the adiabatic limit in the sense of
Epstein and Glaser: We choose a test function
g ∈D(M)
with
g(0) = 1
and set
gε(x) := g(εx)
(A.6.1)
190The second anticommutation relation follows immediately from (A.5.45), the third one is then
obtained by taking the adjoint. To prove the [a(f) , a(g)∗]+-relation, one ﬁrst derives an explicit
formula for a(f)∗by using the deﬁnition of the scalar product in H−
n – similarly to our procedure
in the bosonic Fock space.

Epstein and Glaser’s Wightman- and Green functions. If all basic ﬁelds are mas-
sive, the weak adiabatic limits (A.6.3) and (A.6.4) deﬁning the Wightman and
Green functions, respectively, exist and are unique for any renormalization re-
specting our axioms. More precisely, Epstein and Glaser proved the following (see
[66, Sect. 8.2] and also [38, Sect. 5.1]):
Theorem A.6.2 (Existence and uniqueness of weak adiabatic limit for massive
ﬁelds). Let d = 4, let all basic ﬁelds be massive, scalar ﬁelds and let the interacting
ﬁelds and the time-ordered product of interacting ﬁelds appearing on the r.h.s. of
(A.6.3) and (A.6.4), respectively, be constructed in accordance with our axioms

Appendix
for the R- (or T -) product. (The axiom “Sm-expansion” may be replaced by the
weaker axiom “Scaling degree” (3.2.62).) Then, the weak adiabatic limits (A.6.3)
and (A.6.4) exist and are unique.
The resulting Wightman and Green functions are elements of D′(Mk) and
they satisfy all linear properties one expects for them – in the sense of formal
power series in κ. For the Wightman functions these are the Wightman axioms
(formulated in terms of the Wightman functions) [162, Sect. 3.3] except the cluster
decomposition property, where positivity of the Wightman functions is understood
in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.4.4. For the Green functions these are Poincar´e co-
variance, symmetry, i.e.,

Rough idea of the proof: For the existence and uniqueness of the weak adiabatic
limit we argue in terms of the Green function, for the Wightman function anal-
ogous arguments hold true. First we integrate out (A.6.4) with an arbitrary test
function f(x1, . . . , xk) ∈D(Mk). Then, to write down the r.h.s. of (A.6.4) to nth
order in L, we use the generalized retarded product Rn,k, introduced in (3.3.49);
omitting constant prefactors we get

The assumption that all basic ﬁelds are massive simpliﬁes the proof crucially: It
implies that there is a mass gap in the energy-momentum spectrum of the model,
that is, the vacuum state is separated from the rest of the spectrum. By using
this gap, one can show that (p1, . . . , pn) −→
rn,k(p1, . . . , pn; f) is smooth in a
neighbourhood of (p1, . . . , pn) = 0 – this is the core of the proof. Noting that

for all h ∈D(M), it is then obvious that the adiabatic limit (A.6.12) exists and is
unique.191
The asserted properties of WL(· · · ) and GL(· · · ) are not diﬃcult to see, apart
from the spectral condition [66] and the positivity of the Wightman functions (see
below), because corresponding properties hold true before the adiabatic limit is
taken. For the Causality of the Green functions this is explained in Remk. 4.2.4.

, where a ∈M and still g ∈D(M) with
g(0) = 1, the limit ε ↓0 is not only independent of g, it does also not depend on
a.
Finally, we give the proof of the positivity of the Wightman functions, which
is due to Pawel Duch [39, Sect. 5.2]: Let
Fε := A1,L(gε)(h1) ⋆· · · ⋆Ak,L(gε)(hk)
and
F := Fε=1 ,
with arbitrary Aj ∈Pbal, hj ∈D(M) and with L = κL ∈κPbal. We have to prove
that
C[[κ]] ∋lim
ε↓0 ω0(F ∗
ε ⋆Fε) ≥0;
(A.6.15)
we will do this by using the criterion (5.4.24). First, we conclude from
ω0(F ∗ε ⋆Fε) = ω0

(F ∗
ε ⋆Fε)∗
= ω0(F ∗
ε ⋆Fε)
that
lim
ε↓0 ω0(F ∗
ε ⋆Fε) ∈R[[κ]] .
To verify the further parts of the criterion (5.4.24), let O be an open double cone
containing {0} ∪supp h1 ∪· · · ∪supp hk and let g ∈G(O) (3.7.10). Due to 0 ∈O
191Naively one might think that the result (A.6.9)–(A.6.10) contradicts the statement here that
the adiabatic limit (A.6.4) exists and is unique for all renormalizations of rn,k respecting our
axioms. But the result (A.6.9)–(A.6.10) does not apply here for the following reason: Due to
the support property (3.3.50) of Rn,k
L(y1), . . . , L(yn); A1(x1), . . . , Ak(xk), all contributing
diagrams have the property that every interaction vertex yj (1 ≤j ≤n) is connected with at
least one ﬁeld vertex xs (1 ≤s ≤k) – this argumentation is analogous to the proof of Claim
3.1.27. Therefore, expressing rn,k completely in terms of T-products by means of (3.3.51) and
(3.3.37), there is no term containing a vacuum subdiagram, that is, a factor of the form (A.6.5).

it holds that gε ∈G(O) for all 0 < ε ≤1. Using the Fock space representation

with

(A.6.16)

where gε −g = aε +bε with supports according to (3.7.13). The crucial observation
is that

Applying the map Φ to the relation (A.6.18), we obtain:
Φ(Fε,0) = Φ

Uε,0 ⋆F0 ⋆(Uε,0)⋆−1
= Φ(Uε,0) Φ(F0) Φ(Uε,0)−1
with Φ(Uε,0) = Id +O(κ). Using additionally (A.6.16) for ε = 1, we get the asser-
tion:
Φ(Fε,0) = Φ(F0) (1 + O(κ)) = κn F op

diagrams contribute to R1,1

; nevertheless, the core of the mechanism
underlying (A.6.19) is the same.
Remark A.6.4 (Generalization of Thm. A.6.2 to massless ﬁelds). This theorem
can be generalized to models with massless basic ﬁelds; in addition, fermionic
and gauge ﬁelds (which may be massive or massless) can also be admitted. Ph.
Blanchard and R. Seneor [9] have worked this out for QED and the massless, scalar
κ ϕ2n model, with n ≥2. P. Duch has generalized their result to a larger class of
models in his very readable Ph.D. thesis [38] and in [39].
If the model contains massless basic ﬁelds, there is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence
to the purely massive case: Existence and uniqueness of the weak adiabatic lim-
its (A.6.3) and (A.6.4)needs the validity of a certain renormalization condition!
P. Duch has shown the following:
• If all basic ﬁelds are massless, this renormalization condition follows from
almost homogeneous scaling of r(A1, . . . , An) for all monomials A1, . . . , An ∈
P, that is, from our Sm-expansion axiom, see Remk. 3.1.23.
• For models containing massless and massive basic ﬁelds, the existence and
uniqueness of the weak adiabatic limits (A.6.3) and (A.6.4) follows from the
validity of an additional renormalization condition; which is compatible with
our list of renormalization conditions, if the “Sm-expansion” is replaced by
the weaker renormalization condition “Scaling degree” (3.2.62). (By “com-
patible” we mean that there exists a common solution.)
Following [38, Theorem 4.2.1], a main consequence of Theorem A.6.2 and its gen-
eralizations (Remk. A.6.4) is that we can deﬁne a state ω on the algebra Aloc
L
of
all local observables (3.7.19), which is the inductive limit of the algebras AL(O)

Let us check the deﬁning properties of a state (Deﬁnition 2.5.1): Obviously, ω
is linear and normalized. That ω is real and positive follows from the corresponding
properties of the Wightman function WL

positivity is meant in the sense of Deﬁnition 5.4.4.
One checks straightforwardly that ω is Poincar´e invariant:

(A.6.21)
where αL is deﬁned in (3.7.20) – the argumentation is essentially the same as in
the veriﬁcation of the Poincar´e covariance of the Wightman functions (A.6.13).
Due to (A.6.21), we may interpret ω as vacuum state.
Agreement with the Gell-Mann–Low formula. In the traditional literature there is
a famous formula for the perturbative computation of Green functions: The Gell-
Mann–Low formula [81]. In the presence of massless ﬁelds, this formula usually
contains IR-divergences. Therefore, we write it down in an IR-improved form [46,

One can show that this formula agrees with Epstein and Glaser’s deﬁnition of

less ﬁelds, we refer to [38, App. B].

term separately. Since the latter is precisely the nth order in L of the expression
written in the middle of (A.6.23), we then have proved the ﬁrst equality in (A.6.23).
Finally, the second equality in (A.6.23) follows immediately from (A.6.11), since
we renormalize the vacuum diagrams (A.6.5) by the central solution.

Our proof of (A.6.25) relies on the existence of the mass gap, more precisely,
on the fact that all Δ+
m-propagators contributing to ⋆≥1 in (A.6.25) have m > 0.
Inserting the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24) of T(· · · ) and T (· · · ) into (A.6.25),
we see that all terms are of the form

A.7
Remarks about the connection to
traditional approaches
We aim to compare the approach given in this book with traditional approaches
to pQFT.192 This appendix is far from an exhaustive comparison, we only discuss
a few topics, for which remarkable diﬀerences appear – diﬀerences which are not
pointed out in the main text (see in particular Sect. 3.9.5 for the comparison with
the functional integral approach) or in Appendix A.6. We will not explain the
procedures in the traditional approaches to which we refer, we assume that the
reader knows them – at least roughly.
Composite interacting ﬁelds. We study this topic in terms of the interacting elec-
tromagnetic current of QED; for details see [40, Sect. 2.3]. Epstein and Glaser’s
[66] deﬁnition of jμ
L(g) (which we use in this book), satisﬁes the interacting Maxwell
equation (i.e., the ﬁrst equation of (5.3.1)) and, augmented by the relevant MWI
(Sect. 5.2), the current conservation (5.2.34); hence, it is physically acceptable. In
contrast to conventional deﬁnitions of the interacting electromagnetic current, it
does not need any regularization.
Let us explain this diﬀerence: Mostly one deﬁnes jμ
L(g)(x) in terms of the
interacting spinor ﬁelds ψL(g)(x) and ψL(g)(x). The naive attempts
(a) ψL(g)(x) ⋆γμψL(g)(x)
or
(b) ψL(g)(x) ∧γμψL(g)(x)
192This appendix is based on discussions with Detlev Buchholz and Klaus Fredenhagen.

506
Appendix
fail: The pointwise products of distributions appearing in (a) do not exist. And, (b)
is physically wrong – this can be seen already to ﬁrst order in L(g): Looking at the
Feynman diagrams (i.e., the contraction patterns) of the ﬁrst-order contribution
• to the Epstein–Glaser expression, that is, R

L(x1); jμ(x)

(given in (5.2.36),
where L = eL),
• to (a) (where we ignore the divergences)
• and to (b), respectively,
we see that the former two contributions have precisely the same diagrams, the
three diagrams in (5.2.37). But (b) does not contain the ﬁrst diagram in (5.2.37),
because in (b) there do not appear any contractions between the interacting ﬁelds
ψL(g)(x) and γμψL(g)(x).
The usual way out is to regularize (a) by a point splitting:
˜jμ
L(g) := lim
ζ→0

ψL(g)(x) ⋆γμψL(g)(x + ζ) −qμ(x, ζ)

,
(A.7.1)
where qμ(x, ζ) is chosen such that it compensates the singularities of ψL(g)(x) ⋆
γμψL(g)(x + ζ) appearing in the limit ζ →0. Of course this does not ﬁx qμ(x, ζ)
uniquely, it may be further restricted by requiring, besides some obvious conditions
as Poincar´e covariance, that ˜jμ
L(g) satisﬁes the interacting Maxwell equation and
current conservation, see [14].
Terms like ψL(g)(x) ⋆γμψL(g)(x + ζ) can be systematically described for
ζ →0 by the operator product expansion, which is due to Wilson [170] and has
been established in pQFT by Zimmermann [177]. A treatment in the framework
of perturbative AQFT (see Sect. 3.7), which points out the algebraic aspects and
can be generalized to curved spacetimes, has been given by Hollands [104].
The role of the interacting ﬁeld equations. In most traditional textbooks on per-
turbative QFT, the ﬁeld equations for the interacting quantum ﬁelds play a minor
role; a reason for this may be that one is primarily interested in the S-matrix,
that is, in the T -product. However, there are a few constructions of pQFT, for
which the interacting ﬁeld equations are a major ingredient; for example, Brandt’s
construction of QED [14], Steinmann’s construction of Wightman functions [156]
and parts of the work of Zimmermann, e.g., [177].
The quantization of clFT given in this book amounts to an inductive con-
struction of the R-product. A main justiﬁcation that R

eS/ℏ
⊗, F

can be physically
interpreted as perturbative interacting quantum ﬁeld is that it fulﬁlls the interact-
ing ﬁeld equation(s). In addition, the ﬁeld equations play also an important role
in our formulation of symmetries: Classically, the MWI is simply the oﬀ-shell ﬁeld
equation multiplied pointwise with an arbitrary interacting ﬁeld.
In our construction of the R-product (and also in [40]), we show that renor-
malization can be done such that the ﬁeld equations are maintained: The renor-
malized ﬁelds satisfy precisely the same ﬁeld equation(s) as the classical ﬁelds and

A.7. Remarks about the connection to traditional approaches
507
the unrenormalized ﬁelds, respectively, see (5.3.1). In particular, the mass(es) and
the coupling constant(s) have the same value, which is the physical value.
This contrasts with the construction of Brandt [14]: In a ﬁrst step he con-
structs the renormalized, interacting basic ﬁelds193 ψeL(x), ψeL(x) and Aμ
eL(x),
which involves mass and coupling constant renormalization. Then, in terms of
these ﬁelds, he deﬁnes interacting composite ﬁelds, e.g., the electromagnetic cur-
rent ˜jμ
eL(x), by the point splitting method (A.7.1), such that the interacting Dirac
and Maxwell equation are satisﬁed; the parameters m and (−e) appearing in the
latter equations, which may be interpreted as the physical electron mass and the
physical electron charge, respectively, are required to agree with the respective
renormalized quantities obtained in the ﬁrst step. Needless to say that the re-
sulting formulas for the counter terms (i.e., qμ(x, ζ) in case of ˜jμ
eL(x)) are rather
complicated.
About the notions “on-” and “oﬀ-shell”. In causal perturbation theory the notions
“on-” and “oﬀ-shell ﬁeld” are deﬁned as explained in Sect. 1.6. We are now going
to explain, how this deﬁnition is related to the usage of the words “on-shell” and
“oﬀ-shell” in the traditional literature.
(a) Traditional literature: In this formalism, the notions “on-” and “oﬀ-shell”
are mostly used for the renormalized amplitude belonging to a given Feyn-
man diagram in momentum space. Since the adiabatic limit is performed,
this amplitude is a function of the external momenta p1, . . . , ps only, i.e.,
the momenta belonging to the external lines. Let τ(p1, . . . , ps) be the “am-
putated” amplitude, that is, the amplitude without the factors coming from
the external lines.
• When computing the S-matrix, each external line represents a free ﬁeld
in Fock space: ˆΦop
k (pk) , k = 1, . . . , s. Hence, the contribution to the
S-matrix reads

pj∈Hmj ∀j · :

k=1

k (pk): ,
(A.7.2)
where Hm denotes the mass shell (1.6.1). Therefore, only the “on-shell
amplitude” τ(p1, . . . , ps)


pj∈Hmj ∀j is relevant, because each external
momentum pk appears also as argument of a factor ˆΦop
k , which is an
on-shell ﬁeld: supp ˆΦop
k ⊆Hmk.
• When computing the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered pro-
duct of the interacting ﬁelds ˆΦop

s,κL(ps), i.e., the Green
function, by means of the Gell-Mann–Low formula (cf. App. A.6), each

the adiabatic limit. By (−e) we mean the renormalized coupling constant.

bution is

(A.7.3)
Since supp ˆΔF
m = Md, the “oﬀ-shell amplitude” is needed, that is,
τ(p1, . . . , ps) without restriction of the external momenta to the mass
shell.
The contribution to the S-matrix (A.7.2) is obtained from the contribution
of the same Feynman diagram to the Green function (A.7.3) by the “LSZ
reduction formula” [124].
(b) On-shell formulation of causal perturbation theory: In the original formu-
lation of causal perturbation theory given by Epstein and Glaser [66], the
arguments and the values of the R- and T -product are Fock space operators,
that is, on-shell ﬁelds. Such an on-shell R- or T -product can be introduced
also in our functional formalism; this is worked out in Sect. 3.4. If the adi-
abatic limit is performed, the picture is essentially the same as in (a). The
main diﬀerence is that instead of the expansion in terms of Feynman dia-
grams in momentum space, one studies the causal Wick expansion (3.1.24)
in x-space.
• Let us explain this more explicitly in terms of the contribution194

A.7. Remarks about the connection to traditional approaches
509
Here and in the following we omit combinatorial factors and powers
of 2π, and the adiabatic limit is naively performed by setting g(x) :=
1 ∀x ∈Md.
For example, for n = 4 there are four diﬀerent x-space Feynman dia-
grams (that is, contraction schemes, see Remk. 3.3.4) contributing to
tEG(x1 −x4, x2 −x4, x3 −x4), namely the connected diagrams

If m > 0 and if the adiabatic limit is carried out according to Ep-
stein and Glaser, then the disconnected diagram does not contribute
to (A.7.4), because the vacuum subdiagram (i.e., the connected compo-
nent with vertices x2 and x3) vanishes in the adiabatic limit, as derived
in Exap. A.6.1.
The term (A.7.4) can be rewritten in momentum space:195

tEG
−(p1 + p2), 0, . . . , 0

δ(p1 + p2 + p3 + p4) .
(A.7.8)
Similarly to (A.7.2), only the on-shell amplitude τEG

H×4
m
contributes
to (A.7.7), that is, to the S-matrix.
195In (A.7.4) the number of (d-dimensional) integrations is the order n of the T-product, the
integrations run over the x-coordinates of the vertices. This is in contrast to (A.7.7), where the
number of integrations is the number of external lines, the integrations run over the momenta of
the external lines. Since we proceed in the adiabatic limit, the amplitude τ EG contains δ(p1+p2+
p3 + p4) expressing energy-momentum conservation of the scattering process; and the momenta
belonging to inner vertices (i.e., vertices which do not carry any external line) are = 0, in the
example at hand these are the momenta which are conjugate to (x2 −xn), . . . , (xn−1 −xn),
respectively.

510
Appendix
• Oﬀ-shell amplitudes appear also in the Epstein–Glaser on-shell formal-
ism, when one studies Green functions. To explain this by the analogon
of the example (A.7.4)–(A.7.5), we investigate
G(y1, . . . , y4) := Gκ:ϕop 4:

ϕop(y1), . . . , ϕop(y4)

,
where the Fock space version of the deﬁnition (A.6.4) is used. This Green
function can be computed by means of the Gell-Mann–Low formula,
more precisely, the Epstein–Glaser Fock space version of the expression
written in the middle of (A.6.23): To nth order we obtain

oﬀ-shell amplitude is needed.

A.7. Remarks about the connection to traditional approaches
511
(c) Oﬀ-shell formulation of causal perturbation theory: In the formulation of
causal perturbation theory given in this book, both the arguments and the
values of the R-/T -product are oﬀ-shell ﬁelds. This is advantageous for vari-
ous purposes; examples pointing this out are Remk. 3.1.2 and Footn. 127 for
the arguments of the T -product and Remk. 3.6.5 for the values.
For simplicity we assume that all ﬁeld polynomials Aj ∈P appearing
in the argument of the (oﬀ-shell) T -product contain only zeroth and ﬁrst
derivatives of ϕ, that is, they fulﬁll (3.4.40). Then, we have ξπ(Aj) = Aj
(3.4.41) and, using the deﬁnition of T on (3.4.8), we conclude from the results
of Sect. 3.4.2 that T EG is connected to our oﬀ-shell T -product by

• We recall from Proposition A.6.5 that in the oﬀ-shell formalism of this
book Green functions can be computed by the expression written in the
middle of (A.6.23). For the Green functions it does not matter whether
we work with our oﬀ-shell formalism or with the on-shell formalism
of Epstein and Glaser: The computation is precisely the same and we
obtain precisely the same results, e.g., we also get (A.7.11) for the just
considered example. The reason for this is the relation (A.7.13), that is,

• However, considering the oﬀ-shell S-matrix

there is an essential diﬀerence between the two formalisms: The entire

, (A.7.15)
is equal to the corresponding coeﬃcient tEG(x1 −xn, . . .) (A.7.5) in the
Epstein–Glaser framework, again this is an application of the identity
(A.7.13). But, the contribution of t(x1 −xn, . . .) (A.7.15) to the oﬀ-shell
S-matrix reads
	
dx1 · · · dxn t(x1 −xn, . . . , xn−1 −xn) ϕ2(x1) ϕ2(xn) ,
(A.7.16)
where ϕ(x) is now an oﬀ-shell ﬁeld; the diagram visualizing the inte-
grand of (A.7.16) is again (A.7.6).
To rewrite the term (A.7.16) in momentum space, we introduce the
Fourier transformed basic ﬁeld:
ˆϕ(p) :=
1
(2π)d/2
	
dx eipx ϕ(x) ,
that is,
ˆϕ(p)(h) := ˆh(p)
∀h ∈C ;
note that ˆh is in general a distribution, because the conﬁgurations h do
not need to decay rapidly in all directions. With that we obtain
(A.7.16) ∼
	
dp1dp2dp3dp4 τ EG(p1, p2, p3, p4) ˆϕ(p1) ˆϕ(p2) ˆϕ(p3) ˆϕ(p4) ,
where τEG(p1, . . .) is given in terms of t = tEG by (A.7.8). Since, for
the support in momentum space, we have supp

dp ˆϕ(p) g(p) = supp g
for any g ∈D(M), it is the oﬀ-shell amplitude τ EG(p1, . . .) which is
relevant here – in contrast to the traditional literature (A.7.2) and the
Epstein–Glaser formalism (A.7.7).
