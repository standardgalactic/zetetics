Deep-seafloor organisms consume oxygen, which can be measured by 
in situ benthic chamber experiments. Here we report such experiments 
at the polymetallic nodule-covered abyssal seafloor in the Pacific Ocean 
in which oxygen increased over two days to more than three times the 
background concentration, which from ex situ incubations we attribute to 
the polymetallic nodules. Given high voltage potentials (up to 0.95 V) on 
nodule surfaces, we hypothesize that seawater electrolysis may contribute 
to this dark oxygen production.
Oxygen (O2) is prevalent in deep-sea surface sediments where its rate 
of consumption reflects the sum of aerobic respiration and oxidation 
of reduced inorganic compounds produced by anaerobic decay. These 
processes define sediment community O2 consumption (SCOC), and 
quantifying SCOC is needed to estimate fluxes of major elemental cycles 
through marine systems1–3. We undertook multiple in situ benthic cham-
ber lander experiments to measure abyssal SCOC in the Nauru Ocean 
Resources Inc. (NORI)-D licence area of the Clarion–Clipperton Zone 
(CCZ; Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1) where polymetal-
lic nodules cover extensive areas of seafloor. Sediments and nodules 
were exposed to different experimental treatments, which included the 
addition of dead-algal biomass, dissolved inorganic carbon and ammo-
nium (NH4
+) or cold filtered surface seawater. No-injection controls were 
also performed. In contrast to previous deep-sea O2 flux studies that only 
showed SCOC, we consistently found that more O2 was accumulating in 
the chambers than was being consumed, resulting in net O2 production.
Constant linear decreases in O2 optode readings were observed in 
two experiments (Fig. 1), and SCOC determined by in situ O2 micropro-
filing was 0.7 mmol O2 m−2 d−1 indicating that SCOC occurs in NORI-D as 
in many abyssal habitats2–4. However, O2 concentrations in 25 benthic 
chamber incubations started at 185.2 ± 2.9 µmol l−1 (1 standard error 
(SE)) and reached O2 maxima between 201 and 819 µmol l−1 over 47 h 
(Fig. 1), indicating net dark O2 production (DOP) corresponding to 
rates of 1.7–18 mmol O2 m−2 d−1. Independent measurements of O2 
concentration using the Winkler method also showed DOP (Extended 
Data Fig. 2), providing evidence that the optodes were not malfunction-
ing. No statistically significant difference in the total net O2 produced 
(maximum [O2] – initial [O2]; Extended Data Table 2) was found between 
chambers (ANOVA, F2,9 = 0.107, p = 0.900) or experimental treatments 
(ANOVA, F3,9 = 0.876, p = 0.489), ruling out any experimental bias. We 
found no difference in the total net O2 produced between cruises 
(ANOVA, F2,12 = 0.391, p = 0.684), though DOP was correlated to the 
average surface area of the nodules (Spearman’s correlation, ⍴ = 0.664, 
p = 0.031). A re-evaluation of in situ O2 optode data collected from 36-h 
benthic chamber experiments in the abyssal eastern and western CCZ 
(Extended Data Figs. 1 and 3) also showed DOP, indicating its occur-
rence in multiple locations across the CCZ. Our findings contrast with 
all published deep-sea benthic O2 flux studies and suggest that DOP may 
provide O2 for benthic respiration. Whereas the DOP measured was 
greater than SCOC, we would urge caution when temporally upscaling 
our results, as the nonlinear production of O2 suggests that DOP may 
not be continuous in nature. Moreover, the variance in DOP activity 
seen between experiments and its relationship to nodule surface area 
suggests DOP activity may change with nodule spatial density and type 
(for example, diagenetic versus hydrogenetic), so upscaling our results 
by area is also imprudent without additional studies.

to purge air from the chambers as the lander sinks. Even if an air bubble 
could be trapped long enough to reach the seafloor, gaseous diffusion 
of O2 into the water phase would take < 1 s at 4,000 m depth (Extended 
Data Table 3), which is inconsistent with the steady increase in O2 over 
many hours seen in multiple experiments (Fig. 1). Third, intrusion of O2 
from the plastic chambers into the water phase is unlikely (Methods) as 
they are built from polyoxymethylene, which is both highly inert and 
chemically stable in well-oxygenated settings and would not explain 
the variation in DOP because all experiments used identical materials. 
Last, DOP was also observed during 48-h ex situ sediment incubations 
(Extended Data Fig. 4).
Several lines of enquiry were pursued to explain the DOP. Subsur-
face advection of oxic bottom water from seamount flanks into seafloor 
sediments5,6 and then into the chambers was discounted based on 
in situ O2 microprofiling that showed pore water was a net sink for O2 
and undersaturated compared with the O2 seen in the chambers. Fur-
thermore, DOP was measured in sealed ex situ experiments (Extended 
Data Fig. 4) that prevented O2 intrusion from below. It is unlikely that 
biological mechanisms were responsible for the bulk of the DOP as 
ex situ core incubations revealed DOP in the presence of poison (HgCl2; 
Extended Data Fig. 4). Whereas many microbes in the CCZ are able to 
detoxify Hg (II) to Hg (0)7, and some microhabitat pore spaces in the 
core may have remained HgCl2 free, the taxa known to be capable of 
DOP (for example, Nitrosopumilus maritimus) are killed by its addition8. 
We also observed weak statistical support between the relative abun-
dance of certain nitrogen-cycling microbial taxa and DOP (for example, 
Candidatus Nitrosopumilus ⍴ = 0.474, p = 0.420). The fact that DOP 
was detected in ex situ controls containing only polymetallic nodules 
(Extended Data Fig. 4) suggested that the DOP was linked to their pres-
ence. Hence, we estimated the potential contribution of radiolytic O2 
production using a kinetic model9 and found 0.18 μmol l−1 O2 would be 
generated by this process within 48 h. We also modelled the chemical 
reduction of manganese (IV) oxide at in situ temperature (1.6 °C) across 
a range of pH and O2 conditions encountered at the seafloor to assess 
if this reaction (2MnO2 → 2MnO + O2;Extended Data Fig. 5) could liber-
ate the O2 but found that <0.1 nmol of manganese (IV) oxide would be 
chemically reduced to manganese (II) at seafloor conditions. As such, 
localized radiolytic O2 production from the sediments and nodules and 
chemical dissolution explain only a negligible proportion (< 0.5%) of 
the DOP observed.
The oxygen evolution reaction requires an input voltage of 1.23 V 
plus an overpotential of approximately 0.37 V to split seawater into 
H2 and O2 (ref. 10) at NORI-D’s seafloor mean pH (7.41). This value can 
be lowered by several hundred millivolts if the reaction proceeds via 
the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism11. Use of metal catalysts such 
as Mn oxides enriched with transition metals (for example, Ni) found 
in nodules12 and characterized by large tunnel areas and abundant 
defect sites can optimize the adsorption of reactants and enhance 
conductivity and catalytic performance11,13,14. We tested the electrical 
potential between two platinum electrodes at 153 sites on the sur-
faces of 12 nodules (Fig. 2) from the UK1, NORI-D and Bundesanstalt 
für Geowissenschaften und Rohstoffe (BGR) license areas. Although 
the potentials between different positions on the nodules were 
highly variable, - potentials up to 0.95 V were found and high mean 
background-corrected potentials were detected under cold-water 
conditions (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Table 4). On the basis of these 
studies and DOP being observed in nodule-only ex situ incubations 
(Extended Data Fig. 4), we hypothesize that the DOP may have partly 
resulted from seawater electrolysis, with the necessary energy coming 
from the potential difference between metal ions within the nodule 
layers, leading to an internal redistribution of electrons. Whereas 
questions remain concerning this potential mechanism (such as the 
identity of the energy source(s), longevity of DOP, catalytic stabilities, 
electrochemical conditions on exposed versus buried nodules surfaces 
and the influence of different chemistries within the nodule layers), 
Several lines of evidence indicate that the DOP was not caused by 
experimental artefacts. First, the total O2 change between the experi-
mental and control (non-injection) treatments was statistically indistin-
guishable, and a steady increase in O2 concentration was recorded over 
many hours in multiple experiments; these observations demonstrate 
that DOP was not attributable to the injection of exogenous fluids. 
Second, diffusion of O2 from trapped air bubbles within the chamber 
was unlikely because each chamber uses two one-way valves in the lid

Fig. 1 | Oxygen concentrations in μmol l−1 measured by calibrated O2 optodes 
through time in h in the different benthic chamber incubations. a–c, The in situ 
benthic chamber lander deployments were made during the 5D (a), 5E (b) and 7A 
(c) cruises to the NORI-D license area (Extended Data Fig. 1). Nodules were present 
in all incubation experiments. The green hue, blue hue and red lines in the 5D figure 
(a) denote dead-algal biomass, dissolved inorganic carbon + NH4
+ and filtered 
seawater treatments, respectively. The gap in the optode data in AKS279-Ch.3 
was caused by the optode periodically not logging data. The black line indicates 
ambient O2 concentration measured on the outside of the benthic chambers 
during AKS273 on the 5D cruise. The green and yellow hue lines in the 5E (b) and 7A 
(c) figures denote the dead-algal biomass and control (no injection) treatments, 
respectively. The minor drops seen in some of the O2 concentration profiles at 28, 
38 and 47 h are caused by the dilution of the chamber water with 50 ml of seawater 
that was entrained from the outside into the chamber through a 1.5 m (0.25 cm 
diameter) open tube when the syringe sampler collected seawater samples from 
within the chamber. The constant O2 concentration measured during the first 2 h 
of the 5D and 7A experiments was due to the stirrers being turned off for 1 h to allow 
the substrates (for example, dead-algal biomass) to sink to the sediment surface. 
Stirrers were turned on during the 5E expedition from the moment the lander was 
deployed until the lander returned and power to the stirrers was disconnected.

the ‘geo-battery’ hypothesis was supported by the link between DOP 
and nodule average surface area. This connection could be due to an 
increased abundance of anode and cathode sites or a greater abun-
dance of high Ni and Cu dendritic porous layers in larger nodules15. 
Assuming the ‘geo-battery’ is partly responsible for the DOP observed, 
the initial high DOP rate may have been related to the ‘bow-wave’ of the 
lander removing sediments from the surface of the nodules and expos-
ing electrochemically active sites on the nodules. The slowdown in DOP 
seen later in the incubations could have then been caused by a reduc-
tion in voltage potential and/or degradation of metal-oxide catalysts 
that has been observed in Mn oxide catalysts previously10. Whereas 
this process requires further investigation, if true, DOP activity may 
fluctuate with sediment coverage on the nodules inviting the urgent 
question of how sediment remobilization and distribution over large 
areas during deep-sea mining may influence DOP.
Understanding the mechanism(s) behind DOP, its temporal nature 
and its spatial distribution will allow its role in abyssal ocean ecosys-
tems to be better understood. Future studies of DOP in the deep sea 
may also shed light on broader relationships between metal-oxide 
deposition, biological evolution and the oxygenation of Earth16,17.

Methods
A benthic chamber lander was deployed in the NORI-D license area six 
times in May–June 2021 (5D cruise), five times in November–December 
2021 (5E cruise) and five times in August–September 2022 (7A cruise) 
(Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). The lander comprised 
three independent, autonomous, square benthic chambers (484 cm2) 
separated by approximately <0.5 m. After arriving at the seafloor, 
the lander waited for 0.07–1.34 d before the chambers were pushed 
into the sediment to create an enclosed microcosm of the seafloor. 
Ten minutes into the incubation period, the enclosed chambers were 
injected with 50 ml of one of three solutions: (1) 0.45-µm-filtered, cold 
surface seawater containing 79.2 mg of freeze-dried Phaeodactylum tri-
cornutum algae, (2) 32 µM Na2HCO3 and 40 µM NH4Cl dissolved in cold 
artificial seawater (salinity 35) and (3) 0.45-µm-filtered, cold surface 
seawater. On some occasions, the injection mechanism failed allowing 
the response to control (no injection) conditions to be measured. The 
seafloor in the study area had a temperature of 1.6 °C ± 0.006 °C (SE, 
n = 28) and a pH of 7.41 ± 0.05 (SE, n = 17). Immediately after the injec-
tion, the overlying water was mixed with a submersible stirrer at 60 rpm 
for 1 min before the stirrer was turned off that allowed any particulate 
substrates to settle for 1 h. After 1 h, the stirrer was then turned on again 
for the remainder of the experiments. During the 5E expedition, the 
stirrers were programmed to continually stir the overlying water even 
immediately after injection.
The syringe samplers removed approximately 50 ml of seawater 
from the water phase of each chamber at 0.1 or 0.03, 1, 3, 9, 28, 38 and 
47 h into the incubation experiment. Oxygen optodes (CONTROS 
HydroFlash O2 manufactured by Kongsberg Maritime Contros GmbH) 
mounted in the lid of each chamber logged O2 concentrations in the 
chamber every 10 seconds throughout each experiment. Two days 
before the first lander deployment of each cruise, the optodes under-
went a two-point, multi-temperature calibration using 0 and 100% O2 
calibration solutions at 1.2, 7, 18 and 30 °C following the recommen-
dations of Bittig et al. (ref. 18). On the 5D cruise, we also calibrated 
the sensors 2 d after the last lander experiment so we could estimate 
optode drift, which was negligible (0.27 µmol l−1 d−1) over the course 
of the six-week cruise. The 0% and 100% O2 saturation solutions were 
created by bubbling 0.45-µm-filtered surface seawater in a bottle sitting 
in a water-chilling/heating unit with N2 gas (0%) or an aquarium air bub-
bling unit (100%) for 30 min. The O2 concentration of the calibration 
solutions was confirmed in triplicate by Winkler titration. After incubat-
ing seafloor sediments for 47 h, the lander chambers were closed by a 
shutter door at the base of the chambers, and the chambers were then 
pulled slowly out of the sediment, which took 1 h. The lander was then 
recalled from the seafloor. In eight instances, the lander programme 
did not finish and the doors did not shut, preventing the sampling 
of sediment and determination of the volume of the water phase in 
the chambers (Extended Data Table 2). Once the lander was back and 
secured on deck, the chambers were opened and the water above the 
sediment removed via syphoning into a bucket. The distance from the 
top of the sediment to the base of the chamber lid was then measured in 
four places to get an accurate water depth for water volume estimates. 
Whenever possible, a photograph was then taken of the chamber sedi-
ment and nodules from directly above the opening of the chamber. All 
syringes containing water samples were removed and taken to the 
shipboard lab for immediate processing or stored in a cold lab (4 °C) 
before processing. The optodes were removed and their onboard data 
downloaded to a computer. Finally, the nodules were removed from 
the chambers and washed of attached organic debris with cold (4 °C), 
0.45-µm-filtered surface seawater and placed in sterile Whirlpak bags to 
be weighed in the laboratory later. The number of polymetallic nodules 
at the seafloor determined from chamber counts was 1170 ± 97 m−2.
Unfiltered syringe sample seawater was carefully transferred 
from each 50 ml syringe to a 12 ml exetainer via a 10 cm tube attached 
to the syringe nozzle, ensuring no air bubbles were introduced and 
immediately fixed for microWinkler titration. The sample was then 
mixed thoroughly using a glass bead placed in the exetainer and placed 
in the dark in a 4 °C refrigerator for 30–45 min to allow the precipitate to 
settle. Once the precipitate had sedimented, the exetainers were shaken 
again and left for 2–3 h before Winkler titrations were performed. All 
titrations were completed within 12 h after sampling to determine dis-
solved O2 concentrations. Each Winkler sample (approximately 5 ml) 
was titrated twice, and duplicate measurements showed minor differ-
ences in O2 concentration (5D cruise error: 3.5 ± 0.3 μmol l−1, n = 71; 5E 
cruise error: 1.3 ± 0.2 μmol l−1, n = 69; 7A cruise error: 2.8 ± 0.4 μmol l−1, 
n = 84). Winkler O2 concentration data were averaged for each syringe 
sample. The O2 concentrations estimated by Winkler analysis were 
22 ± 1% (n = 42, SE, 5D cruise), 8 ± 4% (n = 39, SE, 5E cruise) and 24 ± 2% 
(n = 40, SE, 7A cruise) lower than the concentrations measured by the 
optodes at the same time point in the same incubations most likely 
due to out gassing of supersaturated O2 caused by depressurization 
and warming of the externally mounted syringes (whose samples were 
used for Winkler analyses) during the lander recovery to the surface.
Back on shore, the final O2 concentration values were calculated 
following Bittig et al. (ref. 18) from the optode, calibration and in situ 
pressure data that was derived from the depth where each lander 
deployment was made. Time stamps in the optode data were compared 
to the lander computer programme times so the optode readings 
could be aligned to the schedule of the chamber experiment. The total 
change in O2 concentration in each chamber was then calculated from 
the volume of the water phase above the sediment and the difference in 
O2 concentration from when the chambers started to seal off the sedi-
ment to the point when the maximum O2 concentration was reached.
Benthic O2 microprofiling
Benthic O2 microprofiles were made during lander deployments 
AKS313, AKS316, AKS318 and AKS321 during the 5E cruise using a 
UNISENSE deep-sea microprofiling unit mounted <0.5 m from the 
benthic chambers. The microprofiles were made using 20 cm O2 
microsensors that penetrated the sediment in 0.05 mm steps. The 
microsensors were calibrated 2 h before the lander deployments at 
in situ temperature (1.6 °C) at 0% and 100% O2 saturation (above). At 
each sampling depth, the microsensor stopped for 5 s before each 
measurement was made. The sensor then recorded five individual O2 
concentration measurements. The average of these five measurements 
was taken for each depth point. The sediment surface was determined 
manually based on the turning point in the slope of O2 concentration 
with depth where O2 started to become depleted. SCOC was determined 
from Fick’s first law of diffusion.
Microbiology sampling
Nodule and sediment samples for microbial community analyses were 
collected from the 5D experimental chambers. Approximately 30 g 
of sediment from each of the 0–2 cm and 2–5 cm horizons and 50 g 
of intact nodules were placed in separate sterile Whirlpak bags with 
a pre-sterilized spatula and then transferred to a −80 °C freezer. DNA 
from approximately 10 g of nodules and 250 mg of sediment were 
extracted using the Qiagen PowerMax soil and PowerSoil extraction 
kits, respectively. Extracted DNA was then shipped on dry ice to Lara-
gen Inc. and sequenced using a proprietary in-house method. The V4 
region of 16 S rRNA genes were amplified using the Earth Microbiome 
Project protocol19 with the 515 F (5′‐GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA20) 
and 806 R (5′-GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT21) primers. Raw fastq 
files were processed using a custom pipeline (https://github.com/
Boston-University-Microbiome-Initiative/BU16s) built with QIIME 
2020.2 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0209-9). Adap-
tor sequences were removed using cutadapt (https://doi.org/10.14806/
ej.17.1.200), read truncation positions were determined by mineer 
(more below), amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were generated 
using dada2 (trunc-len-r20) (https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3869)

https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-024-01480-8
and ASVs were clustered to 99% identity with the SILVA 132 database 
(https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/42/D1/D643/1061236) using 
the vsearch cluster-features-closed-reference (https://doi.org/10.7717/
peerj.2584). Due to drops in sequencing quality, all reverse reads were 
truncated by 49 bases (from a length of 301 to 252) as determined by 
minERR, an algorithm for determining optimal sequence length based 
on sequence quality scores (https://github.com/michaelsilverstein/
mineer). Family- and genus-level abundance was computed by sum-
ming the relative abundance of all ASVs with the same family/genus 
classification within each sample. Spearman correlations were then 
computed between family- and genus-level abundance and observed 
optode-derived total O2 changes. Sequences have been archived at 
National Centre for Biotechnology Information GenBank under the 
Bioproject ID PRJNA1117483.
Polymetallic nodule surface area measurements
Photographs of the surface sediment and nodules in the chambers 
were imported into Image J. The outline of each nodule in each cham-
ber photograph was then traced and the surface area of the nodule 
automatically calculated in Image J (assuming each surface nodule 
was flat in shape) and logged as an Image J file before being exported 
and saved as an Excel file.
Radiolysis O2 production estimates
To estimate the potential radiolytic O2 production, published concen-
trations of 238U, 235U, 232Th, 40K (refs. 22–26) in seawater were used (Sup-
plementary Table 1). For nodules, 238U, 235U and 232Th isotopes of three 
nodules from chamber experiments from the 5D cruise were measured 
by Multicollector-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer 
using previously described methods27–29 and averaged; 40K values were 
derived from the literature12. Nodule and seawater contributions were 
calculated using a kinetic model developed by ref. 9 that incorpo-
rates 32 reactions (equation (1) in ref. 30). The nodule boundary layer 
was assumed to be fully integrated with the seawater, surpassing the 
respective ~23 to ~452 μm stopping power distance of alpha and beta 
particles used to model geologic materials31. Sediment radiolytic O2 
was calculated as half of the previously quantified H2 production rates 
in equatorial Pacific subsurface sediment32, given the stoichiometry of 
water’s radiolytic decomposition (an equivalency that probably offers 
an overestimate of derived O2). Contributions from these three com-
ponents (nodules, sediment and seawater) were scaled by the benthic 
chamber’s size and contents to produce an estimate of 0.18 μmol l−1 of 
O2 generated over 48 h according to the following expression.
(O2)t = (Qiz × Ea × G(O2) × MO2 × Aiz
−1 × 10
−2) × (1 −e−λt)
Here (O2)t is the mass (kg) of O2 produced over a given time t (yr), Qiz 
is the mass (g) of the isotope, Ea is the average energy (eV) released 
from the decay of one atom; G(O2) is the radiation chemical yield of 
molecules per 100 eV of the radiation energy; MO2 is the O2 molecular 
mass (g), Aiz is the isotope atomic mass (g) and λ is the isotope-specific 
decay constant (y−1). The overall (O2)t value summed the contributions 
from 238U, 235U, 232Th and 40K across water, nodule and sediment sources.
Electrochemistry measurements
Voltage potentials were measured using a Keithley DMM6500 digital 
multimeter on nodules previously collected by coring in the UK1, 
NORI-D and BGR license areas. Nodules were initially immersed for 
seven days in Instant Ocean artificial seawater (salinity 35). To measure 
the potentials, two electrodes (platinum wire, 99.9% purity) were first 
washed in perchloric acid, rinsed in Milli-Q water and dried before 
being attached to alligator clamps attached to the multimeter. The 
platinum wires were then immersed in Instant Ocean artificial seawater 
in a glass petri dish to measure background voltages (0.003 ± 0.001 V, 
SE, n = 17) until stable. Once stable, a nodule was placed in the petri 
dish and the platinum probes placed on the nodule at random loca-
tions, ensuring contact in one of two ways. We either carefully drilled 
a hole into some nodules so one platinum wire could be fixed inside it 
while the second platinum wire was firmly pressed against the nodule 
surface using a clamp. Alternatively, the platinum wires were pressed 
firmly against two different spots on the nodule surface and held in 
place using a clamp. Voltages were then recorded for 1–2 min until the 
signal was stable. This procedure was repeated up to 20 times in differ-
ent randomly selected regions of the nodules depending on their size. 
Measurements were undertaken on 12 nodules at 21 °C (n = 153) and a 
single control rock composed of metamorphosed carbonate (n = 10). 
Two nodules from UK1 were also retested after being cooled to 5 °C 
(n = 18) by placing them in Instant Ocean water in a refrigerator over-
night. Voltage potentials (n = 20) between two nodules were measured 
using four nodules collected from UK1. Potentials measured during 
each measurement were averaged and corrected for the background 
seawater voltage measured using only Instant Ocean seawater in the 
absence of a nodule. Measured resistances inside some of the nodules 
that were broken up were in the kΩ to 100s of kΩ range, though it is 
unclear if these resistivities change at the nano- or microscale requir-
ing further investigation.
Geochemistry modelling
The chemical stability and solubility of manganese (IV) oxide (birnes-
site) to dissolved Mn2+ as a function of pH and O2 activity was modelled 
using the Geochemist Workbench Professional (version 12) software, 
with the in-built and internally consistent THERMO database. The 
conditions used for generating the phase diagram (Extended Data 
Fig. 5) represent bottom seawater as measured in the eastern CCZ with 
a temperature of 1.6 °C and chlorine and manganese concentrations 
of 0.55 M Cl and 2e−10 M Mn, respectively.
Ex situ core incubations
Opportunistic ex situ experiments were undertaken during the 5D 
cruise using sediment cores retrieved by a multi-corer from the CTA 
area (Extended Data Fig. 1). Immediately after the multi-corer arrived 
back at the surface, cores were removed and transferred to a cold lab 
held at in situ temperature. The cores were then exposed to the fol-
lowing five treatments (administered using a 60 ml syringe), which 
included (1) Na2HCO3 (0.3 μM final concentration, n = 3), (2) NH4Cl 
(10 μM final concentration, n = 3) and (3) NH4Cl (50 μM final concen-
tration, n = 3), (4) 0.3 μM Na2HCO3 + 10 μM NH4Cl (final concentration, 
n = 3) and (5) HgCl2 (1.1 μM final concentration, n = 3). No-injection 
controls (n = 3) were also performed and separate core experiments 
in which four nodules were incubated for 48 h by themselves with no 
additions. After addition, the water phase of each core was stirred and 
a 50-ml sample of top water was taken for microWinkler analysis (as 
above). Stoppers were then placed on the top of the cores, ensuring 
no air bubbles were present. The stoppers were secured tightly and the 
cores fully submerged in a large bucket containing 0.45-µm-filtered, 
cold, surface seawater (salinity 35). The bucket was covered with five 
black plastic bags and secured in the cold room with the lights turned 
off. After 48 h, the cores were removed from the bucket, and the cores 
were inspected for the presence of air bubbles. Only one core, a HgCl2 
treatment, had a gas bubble beneath the bung, which was rejected from 
further analysis, leaving n = 2 for this treatment. The other cores were 
then re-sampled for dissolved O2 and analysed as before. Core-specific 
water volume measurements were used together with the change in O2 
concentration to calculate the total net O2 change per core.
To determine if our ex situ DOP detection was affected by intrusion 
of O2 from the atmosphere into the core tube, two controls were per-
formed: a shipboard test with an O2 microprofiler and a lab-based test 
using the Winkler method. Shipboard, a clean core tube was filled with 
Milli-Q water and sparged with N2 for 10 min before beginning the test. A 
Metrohm 8663 Multimeter was inserted through a predrilled hole in the

rubber stopper, allowing for O2 concentration to be recorded every 5 s. 
An increase from 39 to 69 µmol l−1 was observed over ~5 h, correspond-
ing to a rate of 0.14 mmol m−2 d−1 or 4% of the 3.5 mmol m−2 d−1 mean net 
DOP measured in the ex situ experiments. Back in the home laboratory, 
three of the original core tubes were filled with 4 °C, 0.2-µm-filtered 
artificial seawater (salinity 35) and sparged with N2 for 8 min through 
a filtered pipette tip to achieve an initial dissolved O2 concentration of 
~100 µmol l−1 (for example, the approximate starting O2 concentrations 
for the shipboard experiments). The tubes were sealed with rubber 
stoppers and electrical tape, being careful to avoid bubble forma-
tion. They were then submerged in a 32-gallon plastic garbage can of 
unfiltered seawater (O2 concentration: 228.12 µmol l−1) in a dark cold 
room (8 °C) for 48 h. After 48 h, the tubes were quickly unsealed and 
analysed one at a time to prevent additional O2 dissolution from the 
air. A 50-ml sterile syringe was used to slowly collect 10 ml of seawater 
from the centre of the core tube, being sure to avoid bubble entrain-
ment into the syringe. The sample was carefully expelled into a 10-ml 
reaction vial and fixed using the adjusted values for a 10-ml sample 
according to a volume-scaled Winkler titration protocol33 and the 
reagents from the LaMotte Dissolved Oxygen Test Kit. The fixation 
of each collected sample was done in less than 2 min in a fume hood. 
Dissolved O2 increased by 0.11 mmol m−2 d−1 during the 48 h, which 
corresponds to between 3.2% of the mean net DOP rate observed in 
the ex situ experiments (3.5 mmol m−2 d−1). Both of our control experi-
ments provide high confidence that the diffusion of external O2 into 
the core tubes did not cause the O2 production measured in the ex situ 
core incubations.
Calculations to quantify intrusion of O2 from the 
polyoxymethylene chambers and lids
Oxygen intrusion was estimated from Stephens34 who calculated that 
20.66 µmol l−1 of O2 could diffuse out of 428 cm2 of polyoxymethylene 
plastic when immersed for 48 h in hypoxic water (O2 diffusion rate: 
0.02 µmol O2 cm−2 d−1). To determine the total area of plastic that would 
be available for diffusion (869–1,584 cm2), we added the surface area 
of the lid to the surface area of the four walls that would be exposed 
at the seafloor (based on the depth of the water phase—above). The 
minimum and maximum areas available for diffusion were multiplied 
by 0.02 µmol O2 cm−2 d−1 to estimate that 41.9–76.5 µmol O2 l−1 would 
diffuse out of the polyoxymethylene chamber walls and lid in 48 h under 
hypoxic conditions. Thus, we are highly confident that O2 leakage from 
the plastic chambers could not replicate the high O2 concentration seen 
in some of our oxygenated experiments (Fig. 1).

experiments at NORI-D
Total net oxygen change measured by O2 optodes during the in-situ benthic chamber lander experiments at NORI-D. Stars (*) denote the incubations where the optodes did not start to log 
O2 concentrations immediately or stopped logging before 47 hr meaning the total O2 change could not be determined (designated by a dash [-]). The total net O2 change could also not be 
determined in a sub-set of experiments (designated by a dash [-]) because the chambers failed to seal sediments at the end of the experiment, which meant that the volume of water in the 
chamber could not be determined (designated NA) once the lander arrived back on deck. DOP flux rates were determined from the change in O2 concentration from the point when the 
optodes started logging to t = 47-hr. The determination of net production/ respiration dominated experiments was based on the O2 optode profiles seen in Fig. 1.

Extended Data Table 3 | Theoretical diffusion times for thin versus thick-walled bubbles at the seafloor
Theoretical diffusion times (seconds) for thin versus thick-walled bubbles at the seafloor. The theoretical time for O2 to diffuse from a trapped air bubble at the seafloor was estimated 
by calculating the size of air bubble that would be required at the surface to produce the O2 increase seen in each chamber. This was estimated from the difference between the max O2 
concentration value recorded by the optode and the initial O2 optode reading in the chamber, the volume (L) of the water phase in the chamber and assuming air was comprised of 21% O2. 
The size of the bubble at the seafloor was then computed using Boyle’s law and the in-situ pressure calculated from the deployment depth. The O2 concentration gradient (dC) between the 
bubble and the water phase of the chamber was determined from the concentration of O2 in the theoretical bubble and the initial concentration of O2 in the chamber. The diffusion distance 
(dZ) was set at 10 and 10,000 nm to calculate the diffusion times across a thin versus thick-walled bubble. The diffusion coefficient for O2 (1.064 x 10−5 cm−2 s−1) was calculated from the O2 
diffusion coefficient based on an in-situ salinity of 35 and temperature of 1.6oC. Fick’s first law of diffusion was then used to calculate the diffusion time based on the diffusion coefficient,  
dZ and dC.
