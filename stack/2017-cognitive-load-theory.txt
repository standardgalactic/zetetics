Why cognitive load theory?
To improve student performance, teachers need to understand 
the evidence base that informs and helps improve their practice. 
An area of research with significant implications for teaching 
practice is cognitive load theory. Cognitive load theory was 
recently described by British educationalist Dylan Wiliam as ‘the 
single most important thing for teachers to know’ (Wiliam 2017). 
Grounded in a robust evidence base, cognitive load theory 
provides theoretical and empirical support for explicit models 
of instruction. Research in cognitive load theory demonstrates 
that instructional techniques are most effective when they 
are designed to accord with how human brains learn and 
use knowledge. 
This paper describes the research on cognitive load theory and 
what it means for more effective teaching practice. The first 
part of the paper explains how human brains learn according 
to cognitive load theory, and outlines the evidence base for the 
theory. The second part of the paper examines the implications 
of cognitive load theory for teaching practice, and describes some 
recommendations that are directly transferable to the classroom.
What is cognitive load theory? 
Cognitive load theory is built upon two commonly accepted 
ideas. The first is that there is a limit to how much new 
information the human brain can process at one time. The 
second is that there are no known limits to how much stored 
information can be processed at one time. The aim of cognitive 
load research is therefore to develop instructional techniques 
and recommendations that fit within the characteristics of 
working memory, in order to maximise learning.
Cognitive load theory supports explicit models of instruction, 
because such models tend to accord with how human brains 
learn most effectively (Kirschner, Sweller & Clark 2006). Explicit 
instruction involves teachers clearly showing students what to 
do and how to do it, rather than having students discover or 
construct information for themselves (see Centre for Education 
Statistics and Evaluation 2014, pp. 8-12). Hattie summarises 
explicit instruction as an approach in which:
The teacher decides the learning intentions and success criteria, 
makes them transparent to the students, demonstrates them 
by modelling, evaluates if they understand what they have 
been told by checking for understanding, and retelling them 
what they have been told by tying it all together with closure.
(Hattie 2009, p. 206)
Cognitive load theory emerged from the work of educational 
psychologist John Sweller and colleagues in the 1980s and 
1990s (see especially Sweller 1988, 1999). They assert:
The implications of working memory limitations on 
instructional design can hardly be overestimated … 
Anything beyond the simplest cognitive activities appear to 
overwhelm working memory. Prima facie, any instructional 
design that flouts or merely ignores working memory 
limitations inevitably is deficient.
(Sweller, van Merrienboer & Paas 1998, pp. 252-253)
Cognitive load theory is based on a number of widely 
accepted theories about how human brains process and store 
information (Gerjets, Scheiter & Cierniak 2009, p. 44). These 
assumptions include: that human memory can be divided into 
working memory and long-term memory; that information is 
stored in the long-term memory in the form of schemas; and 
that processing new information results in ‘cognitive load’ 
on working memory which can affect learning outcomes 
(Anderson 1977; Atkinson & Shiffrin 1968; Baddeley 1983). 
How the human brain learns
In order to understand cognitive load theory, it is necessary 
to understand how working memory and long-term memory 
process and store information. 
Working memory is the memory system where small amounts 
of information are stored for a very short duration (Peterson & 
Peterson 1959)1. Working memory roughly equates with what 
we are conscious of at any one time. Clark, Kirschner and Sweller 
call it ‘the limited mental “space” in which we think’ (2012, p. 8). 
Research suggests that an average person can only hold about 
four chunks of information in their working memory at one time 
(Cowan 2001), although there is evidence to indicate differences 
in working memory capacity between individuals (see, for 
example, Barrett, Tugade & Engel 2004). 
Long-term memory is the memory system where large amounts 
of information are stored semi-permanently (Atkinson & Shiffrin 
1968; Tulving 1972). Clark, Kirschner and Sweller call long-term 
memory ‘that big mental warehouse of things (be they words, 
people, grand philosophical ideas, or skateboard tricks) we 
know’ (2012, p. 8). 
Cognitive load theory assumes that knowledge is stored in long-
term memory in the form of ‘schemas'2. A schema organises 
elements of information according to how they will be used. 
According to schema theory, skilled performance is developed 
through building ever greater numbers of increasingly complex 
schemas by combining elements of lower level schemas into 
higher level schemas. There is no limit to how complex schemas 
can become. An important process in schema construction is 
automation, whereby information can be processed automatically 
with minimal conscious effort. Automaticity occurs after extensive 
practice (Sweller, van Merrienboer & Paas 1998, p. 256).

The term ‘working memory’ is occasionally used synonymously with ‘short-term memory’, although some theorists consider these two forms of memory to be distinct. See Cowan (2008) for an overview 
of the distinctions and similarities between various key theories of short-term memory and working memory.
2	
Schema theory was introduced into psychology and education by Frederic Bartlett (1932) and Jean Piaget (1928), and further developed by educational psychologist Richard Anderson (1977, 1978).

Learning to read is a good example of schema 
construction and automation. Children begin to learn 
to read by constructing schemas for squiggles on a 
page – letters. These simple schemas for letters are 
used to construct higher order schemas when they are 
combined into words. The schemas for words, in turn, 
are combined into higher order schemas for phrases and 
sentences. This process of ever more complex schema 
construction eventually allows readers to scan a page 
filled with squiggles and deduce meaning from it. With 
extensive practice, readers can derive meaning from print 
with minimal conscious effort (Sweller, van Merrienboer 
& Paas 1998, pp. 255-258)3. 
Schemas provide a number of important functions that are 
relevant to learning. First, they provide a system for organising 
and storing knowledge. Second, and crucially for cognitive load 
theory, they reduce working memory load. This is because, 
although there are a limited number of elements that can be 
held in working memory at one time, a schema constitutes only 
a single element in working memory. In this way, a high level 
schema – with potentially infinite informational complexity – can 
effectively bypass the limits of working memory (Sweller, van 
Merrienboer & Paas 1998, p. 255). 
If working memory is overloaded, there is a greater risk that the 
content being taught will not be understood by the learner, will 
be misinterpreted or confused, will not be effectively encoded 
in long-term memory, and that learning will be slowed down 
(Martin 2016, p. 8). The automation of schemas reduces the 
burden on working memory because when information can 
be accessed automatically, the working memory is freed up to 
process new information (Laberge & Samuels 1974).  
The limitations of working memory can be overcome 
by schema construction and automation. For example, 
try to remember the following combination of letters: 
y-m-r-e-o-m.In this case each letter constitutes one
item, so you are being required to remember six items at
once. Now try to remember the following combination
of letters: m-e-m-o-r-y. In this case you are still required
to remember the very same six items. However, because
you have a schema in your long-term memory for the
word ‘memory’, you are able to chunk the letters into
just one item. Now your working memory is freed up to
remember other items.
Types of cognitive load
Load type
Source
Effect on learning
Example
Intrinsic load
The inherent complexity of 
the material and the prior 
knowledge of the learner
Necessary to learning  (but 
potentially harmful if too 
high, because it can cause 
cognitive overload)
Learning how to solve the mathematical equation 
a / b = c, solve for a

Learning this equation might have a high intrinsic load for a novice maths 
student, but would have a low intrinsic load for an expert mathematician
Extraneous load
Poorly designed instruction 
that does not facilitate 
schema construction and 
automation
Harmful because it does not 
contribute to learning
The student is required to figure out how to solve the equation themselves, 
with minimal guidance from the teacher

This imposes a high cognitive load, but does little to encourage schema 
construction because the student’s attention is focused on solving the problem 
rather than on learning the technique
Germane load
Well designed instruction 
that directly facilitates 
schema construction and 
automation
Helpful because it directly 
contributes to learning
The student is explicitly taught how to solve the problem and given lots of 
worked examples demonstrating how to do it

This imposes a lower cognitive load on the student, enabling them to learn 
and remember how to solve the problem when faced with it again

For a review of the research on effective reading instruction in the early years of school, see Centre for Education Statistics and Evaluation (2017). There has not been a substantial amount of research 
on how cognitive load theory can be used specifically to inform literacy instruction; an exception is Torcasio & Sweller 2010.

Types of cognitive load 
Cognitive load theory identifies three different types of 
cognitive load: intrinsic, extraneous and germane load (see 
Sweller 2010; Sweller, van Merrienboer & Paas 1998). The three 
types of cognitive load are generally assumed to be additive 
– that is, intrinsic load + extraneous load + germane load = 
total cognitive load4. Cognitive overload occurs when the total 
cognitive load exceeds the working memory capacity of the 
learner (Gerjets, Scheiter & Cierniak 2009, p. 45). 
Intrinsic
Intrinsic cognitive load relates to the inherent difficulty of the 
subject matter being learnt (Sweller 1994, 2010; Sweller & 
Chandler 1994). In simple terms, intrinsic load can be described 
as the ‘necessary’ type of cognitive load.  Two factors influence 
intrinsic cognitive load: the complexity of the material, and the 
prior knowledge of the learner (Sweller, van Merrienboer & 
Paas 1998). This means that subject matter that is difficult for 
a novice may be very easy for an expert. For example, the task 
of learning to write the letters of the alphabet is likely to have a 
high intrinsic load for a child in the first year of school, but the 
same task would have a much lower intrinsic load for a child in 
the second or third year of school. 
Many theorists agree that intrinsic cognitive load can be altered 
by instructional techniques that make complex material easier to 
learn. One way to lower the intrinsic cognitive load of material 
is the ‘simple-to-complex’ approach, where the elements of the 
material are introduced to the learner in a simple-to-complex 
order so that the learner does not initially experience the full 
complexity of the material (van Merrienboer, Kirschner & Kester 
2003). A second method is the ‘part-whole’ approach, where 
the individual elements of the material are introduced to the 
learner first, before the integrated task is introduced (Bannert 
2002; Pollock, Chandler & Sweller 2002). A third approach is to 
introduce the material in its full complexity from the beginning, 
but then to direct the attention of the learner to the individual 
interacting elements (van Merrienboer, Kester & Paas 2006). 
Van Merrienboer and Sweller (2005) state that both simple-
to-complex and part-whole approaches work to reduce the 
cognitive load of learners by introducing single, simple elements 
at the beginning, and gradually increasing complexity. 
Extraneous 
Extraneous cognitive load relates to how the subject matter is 
taught. According to van Merrienboer and Sweller, ‘Extraneous 
cognitive load … is load that is not necessary for learning (i.e. 
schema construction and automation) and that can be altered 
by instructional interventions’ (2005, p. 150). In simple terms, 
extraneous load is the ‘bad’ type of cognitive load, because it 
does not directly contribute to learning. Cognitive load theorists 
consider that instructional design will be most effective when 
it minimises extraneous load in order to free up the capacity of 
working memory. 
A combination of high intrinsic and high extraneous 
cognitive load may be fatal to learning because working 
memory may be substantially exceeded … [I]t may be 
essential to design instruction in a manner that reduces 
extraneous cognitive load.
(Sweller, van Merrienboer & Paas 1998, pp. 263-264)
Theorists of cognitive load have identified a number of 
instructional approaches that work to reduce extraneous 
cognitive load in order to increase the efficacy of instruction 
(van Merrienboer and Sweller 2005, p. 151). Some of these will 
be described in the final section of the paper. 
Germane 
Germane cognitive load refers to the load imposed on the 
working memory by the process of learning – that is, the 
process of transferring information into the long-term memory 
through schema construction (Sweller, van Merrienboer & Paas 
1998, p. 259). For this reason, germane cognitive load can be 
understood in simple terms as the ‘good’ type of cognitive load. 
Theorists of cognitive load assert that instructional material has 
maximum effectiveness when it reduces extraneous load (which 
is not relevant to learning) and increases germane load (which 
is directly relevant to learning). Gerjets, Scheiter and Cierniak 
explain that germane load is ‘caused by a supportive instructional 
design and is helpful for effective learning’ (2009, p. 45). 
The combination of decreasing extraneous cognitive load 
and at the same time increasing germane cognitive load 
involves redirecting attention: Learners’ attention must be 
withdrawn from processes that are not relevant to learning 
and directed towards processes that are relevant to learning 
and, in particular, toward the construction and mindful 
abstraction of schemas.
(Sweller, van Merrienboer & Paas 1998, p. 264)
Theorists of cognitive load generally consider intrinsic, 
extraneous and germane load to be additive (Paas, Renkl & 
Sweller 2003, p. 2). For this reason, the approach of decreasing 
extraneous cognitive load while increasing germane cognitive 
load will only be effective if the total cognitive load remains 
within the limits of working memory (Sweller, van Merrienboer 
& Paas 1998, p. 264).
4	
In response to discussions regarding problems of defining and measuring the different types of load (for example, Schnotz & Kürschner 2007), some cognitive load theorists have recently suggested 
a reformulation of the idea that there are three separate and additive forms of load. This reformulation suggests a return to a dual framework in which intrinsic and extraneous load are defined as the 
two primary types of cognitive load and are considered additive. Germane load is re-defined in terms of intrinsic load – it refers to the working memory resources devoted to dealing with intrinsic load, 
and is not considered additive (Sweller 2010; see also Kalyuga 2011). For clarity, however, the three types of load are considered separate and additive in this literature review.

What is the evidence base for cognitive 
load theory?
Cognitive load theory is supported by a significant number of 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This large body of evidence 
indicates that instruction tends to be more effective when it 
is designed according to how human brains process and store 
information. 
The ‘worked example effect’ is one instructional approach 
recommended by cognitive load research that is supported 
by a substantial number of RCTs5. The worked example effect 
was first demonstrated in the 1980s (Cooper & Sweller 1987; 
Sweller & Cooper 1985). In one early study, Cooper and Sweller 
(1987) designed a series of experiments in which high-school 
maths students were required to learn how to solve a range of 
simple algebra problems. They found that students who were 
taught using lots of worked examples learnt more quickly than 
students who were required to solve the problems themselves. 
Further, they found that the students taught using worked 
examples were not only better able to solve similar problems 
on subsequent tests, but were also better able to solve ‘transfer 
problems’ in which the same algebraic rules they had learned 
needed to be applied in different contexts. The effect has 
since been replicated in a large number of RCTs (for example, 
Bokosmaty, Sweller & Kalyuga 2015; Carroll 1994; Kyun, 
Kalyuga & Sweller 2013; Paas 1992; Paas & van Merrienboer 
1994; Pillay 1994; Quilici & Mayer 1996; Tuovinen & Sweller 
1999). In a meta-analysis of studies on the effectiveness of 
worked examples, Crissman (2006) found an effect size of 0.52.  
The majority of studies in cognitive load research do not 
attempt to directly measure cognitive load itself, but rather 
aim to measure the effectiveness of instructional techniques 
designed to accord with the limitations of working memory. 
Studies of this type typically consist of a control group that 
receives a learning intervention using conventional techniques 
(for example, using independent problem-solving to learn 
a new skill), and a treatment group that receives a learning 
intervention using cognitive load techniques (for example, using 
worked examples to learn a new skill). Both groups are then 
tested to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. The test 
performance of participants is taken as an indirect measure 
of cognitive load, with high results on post-tests considered 
to indicate that cognitive load was successfully managed (for 
example, Mayer et al. 2005; Stull & Mayer 2007). It is worth 
noting that key proponents of cognitive load theory themselves 
acknowledge the need to identify a reliable means of directly 
measuring cognitive load, in order to develop a more empirical 
basis to support the theory (for example, Paas, Renkl & Sweller 
2003, p. 4; Paas et al. 2003, p. 64). 
Some studies do attempt to directly measure the cognitive 
load imposed by different instructional techniques, with 
varying reliability (for an overview, see de Jong 2010; Paas et 
al. 2003). There are a variety of methods for attempting to 
measure cognitive load. One approach is to use physiological 
techniques such as measures of heart activity (for example, 
Fredericks et al. 2005; Paas & van Merrienboer 1994), brain 
activity (for example, Murata 2005; Smith & Jonides 1997) 
or eye activity (for example, Schultheis & Jameson 2004; 
van Gerven et al. 2004). Another approach is to use dual-
task techniques, in which a secondary task is introduced in 
addition to the main learning task, and impaired performance 
in the secondary task is taken to indicate higher cognitive 
load (for example, Brünken, Plass & Leutner 2003; Chandler 
& Sweller 1996). The majority of studies that attempt to 
measure cognitive load use subjective techniques such as rating 
scales, in which participants are asked to indicate the level of 
cognitive load experienced (for example, Paas 1992; Paas, van 
Merrienboer & Adam 1994). 
Questions around cognitive load research
The broad assumptions of cognitive load theory – that the 
capacity of working memory is limited, and that learning is most 
effective when it is designed to accommodate these limitations 
– is generally not contested. It is worth noting, however, that a 
number of scholars have raised questions regarding some of the 
specific assumptions of the theory. These questions generally 
fall into three categories: problems with the definitions of 
cognitive load, concerns about the methodological rigour of the 
research, and issues with its external generalisability. 
In regard to the definitions of cognitive load theory, an 
important question is whether the three different types of 
cognitive load – intrinsic, extraneous and germane – can be 
clearly distinguished (de Jong 2010; Moreno 2010; Schnotz & 
Kürschner 2007). A second concern is whether the three types 
of cognitive load can indeed simply be added to determine the 
total cognitive load experienced by the learner (de Jong 2010; 
Moreno 2010; Park 2010), as has been claimed by cognitive 
load theorists (for example, Sweller, van Merrienboer & Paas 
1998, p. 263; Paas, Renkl & Sweller 2003, p. 2). These concerns 
are important because, if the types of cognitive load cannot 
be clearly separated, it becomes difficult to make practical 
recommendations on how teachers can best manage ‘good’, 
‘bad’ and ‘necessary’ load in a classroom environment6. 
In regard to the methodological rigour of studies, the lack of 
a direct measure of cognitive load is a key concern (Brünken, 
Plass & Leutner 2003; de Jong 2010; Moreno 2010; Schnotz & 
Kürschner 2007). The lack of empirical indicators to distinguish 
between and measure the different types of load (intrinsic, 
extraneous and germane) is also an issue (de Jong 2010; 
Gerjets, Scheiter & Cierniak 2009; Schnotz & Kürschner 2007; 
for attempts to overcome this see DeLeeuw & Mayer 2008; 
Leppink et al. 2014). 
Finally, there are also concerns about whether cognitive load 
research is generalisable to realistic teaching environments. 
De Jong describes a range of problems with generalisability, 
including that cognitive ‘overload’ rarely occurs in realistic 
learning settings; that the very short study time used in most 
cognitive load studies does not reflect the kinds of tasks and 
study time that would occur in real settings; and that study 
conditions are often deliberately constructed to demonstrate 
particular effects that would rarely occur in real learning 
situations (2010, pp. 123-125).

For further detail on the ‘worked example effect’ see 'Types of cognitive load' table on page 3.

A more recent definition of the types of load suggested by Sweller (2010) may quell these concerns.

What does cognitive load theory mean 
for teaching practice? 
Explicit teaching
The question of how people learn best has been the subject 
of significant debate, which can be broadly divided into two 
approaches to teaching practice. On one side are those who 
believe that all people learn best when allowed to discover 
or construct some or all of the information themselves (for 
example, Bruner 1961; Papert 1980; Steffe & Gale 1995). On 
the other side are those who believe that learners do best 
when they are provided with explicit instructional guidance 
in which teachers clearly show students what to do and 
how to do it (for example Klahr & Nigam 2004; Mayer 2004; 
Rosenshine 1986). Cognitive load theory provides theoretical 
and empirical support for the latter, explicit model of 
instruction. Leading theorists of cognitive load argue:
Decades of research clearly demonstrate that for novices 
(comprising virtually all students), direct, explicit instruction 
is more effective and more efficient than partial guidance. 
So, when teaching new content and skills to novices, 
teachers are more effective when they provide explicit 
guidance accompanied by practice and feedback, not 
when they require students to discover many aspects of 
what they must learn.
(Clark, Kirschner & Sweller 2012, p. 6, see also Kirschner, 
Sweller & Clark 2006)  
It is important to note that cognitive load theorists do not 
advocate using all aspects of explicit instruction all the time. 
Indeed, they recognise the need for learners to be given the 
opportunity to work in groups and solve problems independently 
– but assert this should be used as a means for practicing newly 
learnt content and skills, not to discover information themselves 
(Clark, Kirschner & Sweller 2012, p. 6). 
Andrew Martin (2016), for example, advocates a teaching 
model that is explicitly designed around cognitive load theory 
and the constraints of working memory. He suggests, however, 
that less structured approaches can also be an effective 
instructional method for students who are further along the 
novice/expert continuum if such instruction is designed with 
the constraints of working memory in mind.
These approaches are aimed at promoting learner 
independence while managing cognitive load appropriately, 
depending on the learner’s novice/expert status … If the 
instructor provides some guiding principles, prior information, 
signposts along the way, and scaffolds and assistance where 
needed, there is less burden on working memory.
(Martin 2016, p. 39)
There is some research to suggest that managing the cognitive 
load of learners through explicit instruction may also contribute 
to higher levels of motivation and engagement – although 
further research is required in this field (Martin 2016). 
In addition to supporting explicit modes of instruction, 
cognitive load theory also asserts that teaching domain-specific 
skills is more effective than teaching generic skills (Paas & 
Sweller 2012; Tricot & Sweller 2014). An example of a domain-
specific skill might be that, when faced with a problem such 
as a / b = c, solve for a, one should multiply both sides by the 
denominator (Sweller 2016, p. 13). An example of a generic 
skill in mathematics might be general ‘problem-solving’ skills, 
such as the strategy of randomly generating moves until the 
correct solution is found. Cognitive load theorists suggest 
teaching domain-specific skills is more effective because, 
while general problem-solving skills are innate to humans and 
therefore do not need to be explicitly taught, domain-specific 
skills are not automatically acquired by learners without explicit 
teaching (Geary 2012; Tricot & Sweller 2014).

Recommendations for the classroom from cognitive load research
Cognitive load theory has produced a number of recommendations regarding instructional techniques that are directly transferable 
to the classroom. A selection of these are described below, to illustrate how evidence-based cognitive load research can be used by 
teachers to improve student outcomes. 
The ‘worked example effect’
A ‘worked example’ is a problem that has already been solved for the learner, with every step fully explained and clearly shown. The 
‘worked example effect’ is the widely replicated finding that novice learners who are given worked examples to study perform better 
on subsequent tests than learners who are required to solve the equivalent problems themselves (Carroll 1994; Cooper & Sweller 
1987; Sweller & Cooper 1985). The reason for this, according to cognitive load theory, is that unguided problem-solving places a 
heavy burden on working memory, inhibiting the ability of the learner to transfer the information into their long-term memory. The 
learner may effectively solve the problem, but because their working memory was overloaded they may not recognise and remember 
the rule that would allow them to quickly solve the same problem again in the future.
The ‘expertise reversal effect’
The ‘expertise reversal effect’ is an important exception to the worked example effect. According to the expertise reversal effect, the 
heavy use of worked examples becomes less and less effective as learners’ expertise increases, eventually becoming redundant7 or even 
counter-productive to learning outcomes (Leslie et al. 2012; Pachman, Sweller & Kalyuga 2013; Yeung, Jin & Sweller 1998). This means 
that some instructional procedures such as worked examples, which assist learning for novices because they reduce cognitive load, are 
not effective for teaching more expert learners. While cognitive load theory supports fully guided instruction for novice learners, it also 
supports the gradual incorporation of more independent problem-solving tasks as learners gain expertise.
The ‘redundancy effect’
Students do not learn effectively when their limited working memory is directed to unnecessary or redundant information. The 
‘redundancy effect’ occurs when learners are presented with additional information that is not directly relevant to learning, or with 
the same information in multiple forms. An example is a textbook which includes both text and a diagram that needlessly repeat 
information, or a PowerPoint presentation in which the presenter reads the text presented on the screen. Requiring learners to 
process redundant information inhibits learning because it overloads working memory. Cognitive load research shows that best 
practice is to remove redundant information from learning material (Bobis, Sweller & Cooper 1994; Chandler & Sweller 1991; Mayer 
et al 1996; Torcasio & Sweller 2010). Sweller argues:
Most people assume that providing learners with additional information is at worst, harmless and might be beneficial. Redundancy is 
anything but harmless. Providing unnecessary information can be a major reason for instructional failure.
(Sweller 2016, p. 8)
The ‘split attention effect’
The ‘split attention effect’ occurs when learners are required to process two or more sources of information simultaneously in order 
to understand the material. This might occur, for example, when a diagram is used to explain a concept, but it cannot be understood 
without referring to a separate piece of explanatory text. In this instance the learner is required to hold both sources of information in 
their working memory at the same time and to mentally integrate the two. This places a high cognitive load on the working memory, 
interfering with the ability of the learner to transfer the relevant information to their long-term memory. The split-attention effect can 
be minimised or eliminated by physically integrating separate sources of information so that they do not have to be mentally integrated 
by the learner (Cerpa, Chandler & Sweller 1996; Owens & Sweller 2008; Tarmizi & Sweller 1988; Ward & Sweller 1990). Sweller, van 
Merrienboer & Paas argue:
Split attention occurs very commonly in instructional contexts. On the basis of dozens of experiments under a wide variety of 
conditions, the evidence suggests overwhelmingly that it has negative consequences and should be eliminated wherever possible.
(Sweller, van Merrienboer & Paas 1998, p. 281)
The ‘modality effect’
The 'modality effect' is associated with the split attention effect, but offers an alternative technique to reduce cognitive load than 
physically integrating separate sources of information. Instead, it is also possible to decrease extraneous load on working memory by 
using more than one mode of communication – both visual and auditory. Evidence suggests that working memory can be subdivided 
into auditory and visual streams (Baddeley 1983, 2002; Baddeley & Hitch 1974), so presenting information using both auditory and 
visual working memory can increase working memory capacity (Penney 1989). For example, when using a diagram and text to explain 
a concept, the written text can be communicated in spoken form. Using both auditory and visual channels increases the capacity of 
working memory, and facilitates more effective learning (Jeung, Chandler & Sweller 1997; Mousavi, Low & Sweller 1995; Tindall-Ford, 
Chandler & Sweller 1997).

Relevance of cognitive load research in 
different contexts 
Cognitive load theory is particularly relevant to teaching novice 
learners in so-called ‘technical’ domains such as mathematics, 
science and technology. A large number of RCTs demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the instructional approaches recommended by 
cognitive load theory in subjects such as maths and science (for 
example, Bokosmaty, Sweller & Kalyuga 2015; Carlson, Chandler 
& Sweller 2003; Owen & Sweller 1985; Sweller & Cooper, 1985; 
Zhu & Simon 1987). Far less research has been done on whether 
cognitive load theory is effective for teaching in less technical, or 
more creative subject areas – such as literature, history, art and 
other humanities subjects (for exceptions, see Kyun, Kalyuga & 
Sweller 2013; Rourke & Sweller 2009; Schworm & Renkl 2007). 
The majority of studies on cognitive load do not consider how 
individual differences between learners might impact upon 
cognitive load (with the exception of differences in expertise)8. 
De Jong identifies differences in spatial ability and working 
memory capacity, for example, as other important considerations 
(2010). The literature on cognitive load theory is also silent on 
how other factors besides cognitive load might influence the 
effectiveness of learning. Roxana Moreno (2010) notes that 
cognitive load theory does not consider, for example, how 
factors such as a learner’s motivation and beliefs about their 
own ability might influence the effectiveness of learning. 
Conclusion 
Cognitive load theory is a theory of how the human brain learns 
and stores knowledge. The theory is supported by a large number 
of RCTs, and has significant implications for teaching practice. 
Cognitive load research demonstrates that instructional methods 
are most effective when designed to fit within the known limits 
of working memory, and therefore strongly supports guided 
models of instruction. Cognitive load theory offers a range of 
evidence-backed recommendations for educational practice, 
especially for teaching novice learners in ‘technical’ subjects such 
as mathematics, science and technology.

An exception is a number of studies by van Gerven et al. (2002, 2004) that examine the impact of age on cognitive capacity.
