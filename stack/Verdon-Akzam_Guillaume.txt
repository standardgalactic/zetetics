Abstract
Quantum Energy Teleportation provides a testbed for modern ideas involving the inter-
play between quantum correlations and energy in the quantum thermodynamical regime.
In this work, we provide a new class of Quantum Energy Teleportation protocols optimized
for harnessing maximal amounts of correlations between subsystems. We also construct
new measurement protocols for quantum ﬁelds which provide signiﬁcant improvements
for entanglement harvesting. Finally, we construct an eﬃcient formalism for computing
changes in energy due to localized interactions in quantum ﬁeld theory.

Chapter 1
Introduction
The relation between energy and information has intrigued physicists for quite some time
now.
Usually, we speak of such a relation in the context of thermodynamics or black
hole physics. Recently, quite a bit of work has been interested in the thermodynamics of
spacetime itself[37, 14], and on emergent holographic spacetimes [54]. Understanding the
relation between energy, information and geometry is the 21st century holy grail of physics.
The overall focus of this thesis is just that; the interplay between energy and correla-
tions. We approach the topics from multiple diﬀerent angles.
One of the common themes is the coupling of probe systems to certain subsystems of
a correlated quantum systems in order to achieve an energetic or information theoretic
gain. We will cover how measurements, entanglement harvesting, and quantum energy
teleportation aﬀect quantum ﬁelds and harmonic lattices.
Probes are “windows” into the behaviour of a certain system. They can be very useful
to understand certain phenomena in quantum ﬁeld theory, as they eﬀectively reduce the
dimensionality (Hilbert-space-wise) of the problem. They are an indispensable tool for the
study of Relativistic Quantum Information.
Thus, because probing ﬁelds is quite important, we develop a theory for the decompo-
sition of the Hilbert space into “windows”, or rather, algebras of smeared ﬁeld observables.
See sec. 5.2. One of the most useful results is the expression of the Hamiltonian of the
ﬁeld with respect to such smeared obseervables. Eﬀectively, multi-page calculations with
multivariate Gaussian and Fourier integrals simplify to taking a few simple commutators.
Once we are armed with this tool, we apply it to the study of measurement of such
smeared observables (5.3.2) using a continuous-variable adaptation of a quantum com-
puting algorithm known as phase estimation. We introduce the original algorithm in our
1

quantum information background section, while the continuous-variable variant is intro-
duced in chapter 4.
In the chapter 3, we introduce the protocol of quantum energy teleportation. We cover
the basic case of the minimal QET protocol and we write down a general algoithm for QET
which uses multi-observable correlations in order to optimize the teleportation of energy.
In chapter 4, we apply this algorithm to a lattice of harmonic oscillators, and later on, in
chapter 6 we port over this same calculation to QFT, using our Hamiltonian of smeared
observables formalism.
Further on, we apply what we learned about the tensor factors of Hilbert space corre-
sponding to smeared observables to eﬀectively coherently swap quantum information from
a probe system to a subspace of the ﬁeld. We cover this for a continuous-variable probe
and also a set of qubits which eﬀectively “digitize” a subspace of the ﬁeld. We then use
this to harvest entanglement from the vacuum in section 5.4.3.
Finally, in our future works section, we consider how one could ﬁnd the Schmidt basis,
i.e. the basis of a Hilbert space for an entangled state across a bipartition, for a quantum
ﬁeld’s bipartition of the Hilbert space into a spherical region and its complement. By
adapting some recent litterature [37], we are able to eﬀectively ﬁnd the set of modes
for the quantum ﬁeld such that the mode decomposition of the state gives the Schmidt
decomposition.

Chapter 2
Background: Quantum Information
In this chapter we provide a brief review of a few concepts from Quantum Information
theory and Quantum Computing which are essential for understanding the contents of this
thesis.
Most of the content on quantum information theory and quantum computing covered
in this chapter can be found in Nielsen & Chuang [51] and Wilde [72]. For the Gaussian
state formalism, we mainly use work by Adesso [1]. For quantum error correction, we use
Gottesman’s work [24].
2.1
Quantum Information Theory Essentials
It will be assumed that the readers of this thesis have a good background on the basics of
quantum information theory. Thus section is mostly a collection of useful formulas which
we include for convenience.
2.1.1
Information Theoretic Measures
Shannon Entropy
Consider a random classical variable X with a certain probability distribution over out-
comes p(x) = Pr(x = X), then the measure of entropy, sometimes called the Shannon
3

entropy, is deﬁned as1
H(X) ≡
X
x
−p(x) log(p(x)).
(2.1)
In some sense the entropy is a measure of uncertainty in a random variable.
Here is a rough sketch of how this concept applies to certain situations: say we have an
alphabet X and for any given message there is a probability p(x) that a given letter X is
x. Then, if we consider how one could optimally encode this alphabet as binary, then we
can assign more bits to less likely letters, and less bits to the more frequently used letters.
If we want the same number of bits for each letter on average, since they occur at a rate of
1/p(x), and n bits can cover 2n letters, then we use n = log2(1/p(x)) bits per letter. Then,
the entropy is simply the expectation value of the number of bits, P
x p(x) log2(1/p(x)),
hence, asymptotically, we hit a rate of transmission of information equal to the Shannon
entropy of our variable.
Von Neumann entropy
Now, the generalization of the Shannon entropy to quantum systems is called the Von
Neumann entropy. Given some density operator ρ, deﬁned on some Hilbert space HA, the
Von Neumann entropy is given by
S(A)ρ ≡−tr(ρ log(ρ)).
(2.2)
As the density operator is self-adjoint and positive semi-deﬁnite2, taking a logarithm
makes sense in the eigenbasis of ρ, say
ρ =
X
x
px |x⟩⟨x|
(2.3)
then
log ρ =
X
x
log(px) |x⟩⟨x| =⇒−ρ log ρ =
X
x
−px log(px) |x⟩⟨x|
=⇒−tr(ρ log ρ) =
X
x
−px log(px)
(2.4)
and we recognize the Shannon entropy. Thus, the Von Neumann entropy is simply the
Shannon entropy of the spectrum of the density matrix.
1We will be using logarithm base 2 as our standard.
2We deﬁne 0 log 0 = 0 hence for null eigenvalues there is no divergence.
4

Entanglement
The entanglement entropy for a bipartite pure state ρAB ≡|ψ⟩⟨ψ|AB is given by the Von
Neumann entropy of either marginal
S(A)ρ = S(B)ρ.
(2.5)
Note that for a bipartite pure state |ψ⟩AB, because of the singular value decomposition,
there exists a choice of basis for A and for B such that we get
|ψ⟩AB =
X
j
√pj |j⟩A |j⟩B
(2.6)
this is called the Schmidt decomposition of the state.
We can deﬁne the coherent information [72] as
I(A⟩B)ρ ≡H(B)ρ −H(AB)ρ ≡−H(A|B)
(2.7)
it is the negative of the conditional quantum entropy, that is, the negative of the entropy
of A given B. For entangled states, the conditional quantum entropy is negative, hence
the coherent quantum information is positive. The coherent information is also a measure
of two-way distillable entanglement, where entanglement distillation is a protocol where
one gathers many copies of weakly entangled pairs and performs a projective measurement
onto a typical subspace of the ensemble. The result is a set of “distilled” pairs. Two-way
distillable means that the version of the protocol used to distill entanglement used two-way
communication.
Mutual Information
Before we get to the all-important mutual information, let us deﬁne the relative entropy
ﬁrst,
D(ρ||σ) ≡tr (ρ(log ρ −log σ)) .
(2.8)
Note that the relative entropy is similar to a distance measure on the space of density
operators.
Now, we can then deﬁne the mutual information as the distance away from uncorrelated
a given state is,
I(A; B)ρ = D(ρAB||ρa ⊗ρB) = H(A)ρ + I(A⟩B)ρ = H(A)ρ + H(B)ρ −H(AB)ρ.
(2.9)
5

Consider a bipartite Hilbert space HA ⊗HB, and a density operator on this Hilbert
space, ρAB. Let ρA and ρB denote the marginal density operators A and B (e.g., ρA ≡
trB(ρAB)). Note that the mutual information [14] bounds correlations
I(A : B) = S(ρAB||ρA ⊗ρB)
≥1
2|ρAB −ρA ⊗ρB|2
≥
1
2∥OA∥2∥OB∥2 (tr [ρAB −ρA ⊗ρB(OAOB)])2
= (⟨OAOB⟩−⟨OA⟩⟨OB⟩)2
2∥OA∥2∥OB∥2
(2.10)
where and so, for any operators on A and B, the mutual information gives a bound for the
correlation function between these operators.
Thus, as we will see, if we have a protocol which relies on correlations of observables,
then the mutual information will give us a good idea of the maximal eﬃcacy of such a
protocol. This will be the case for QET.
2.1.2
Measurement
POVM
Consider a set of operators {Aj}j which satisfy
X
j
A†
jAj = I.
(2.11)
A POVM measurement is a stochastic operation on ρ such that with a probability
tr(AjρA†
j)
(2.12)
we get an outcome j (classical information), and the collapsed quantum state
AjρA†
j
tr(AjρA†
j)
.
(2.13)
6

Stinespring and Kraus Form
If we average over measurement results of POVM’s, we get the Kraus form for a quantum
channel
ρ 7→
X
j
AjρA†
j.
(2.14)
Note that any quantum channel can always be represented as unitary on a larger Hilbert
space, with ancillary inputs, and then some of the outputs are traced out. This is called
the Stinespring form. Note that this extension is not necessarily unique.
As we will see, we will cover the phase estimation algorithm, which eﬀectively imple-
ments a POVM on some target system. In some cases, it is a projective PVM, but in other
case it is only projective in a certain limit (lots of qubits in the algorithm).
This is essentially what we will use for QET, instead of looking at the problem from
the POVM formalism, we will Stinespring dilate to the phase estimation algorithm.
2.2
Qudits & The Quantum Fourier Transform
2.2.1
Qudits
Qubit Paulis
Pauli matrices play a central role for qubits. They span the Lie algebra3 su(2) , and can be
seen as a set of unitary gates which form a basis for the space of 2×2 Hermitian matrices4.
Unfortunately, for higher dimensions, there is not a single set of matrices which can
play all these roles. In this section we will review some of the generalizations of the Pauli
matrices which individually accomplish these roles for Hilbert spaces of dimension d > 2.
We begin with the Heisenberg-Weyl group.
Heisenberg-Weyl
Let us consider a ﬁrst set of generalized Pauli matrices, often called the Weyl (or Heisenberg-
Weyl operators [9, 70], these act on the Hilbert space H = Cd. The generalized Pauli Z

where the eigenbasis of Z, {|j⟩| j ∈Zd} is the standard basis of Cd, and where υ is the dth
root of unity:
υ ≡e2πi/d.

where [·]d denotes the equivalence class modulo d of a given integer. We see that it cycles
through the eigenstates of Z, which is why Z is the clock; where the arrow of the clock is
pointing, while the X matrix is a clockwise tick of the clock. This tick is in contrast with
usual raising (or lowering) operators in quantum mechanics, which annihilates states that
are of the maximum eigenvalue, while this X operator makes the value wrap around.5 We
will come back to this shortly.
The shift matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation called the Quantum
Fourier Transform
F†XF = Z,
(2.18)
where in the above the unitary change of basis matrix F is called the quantum Fourier
transform.
This unitary operation, is the gate that maps
F : |j⟩7→
1
√
d
d−1
X
k=0
υ−jk |k⟩
(2.19)
hence can be represented in matrix form in the standard basis as
F =
1
√
d
d−1
X
k=0
υ−jk |k⟩⟨j| .
(2.20)
5This is akin to how diﬀerent systems in classical computing treat “integer overﬂow”, that is, when a
calculation exceeds the maximum number value, say d = 2n for n bits, either the computer returns an
error (like a null eigenvalue in our case) or the computer takes the number modulo d.
8

The eigenstates of the X matrix are given by
|xj⟩≡
1
√
d
d−1
X
k=0
υ−jk |k⟩= F |j⟩
(2.21)
and the eigendecomposition of X is given by
X =
d−1
X
j=0
υj |xj⟩⟨xj| .
(2.22)
We see that both matrices share the same spectrum which consists of all the dth roots
of unity, {υj = e2πij/d|j ∈Zd}. This tells us that Xd = Zd = I, and that the clock and
shift matrices can be viewed as displacement operators on a toroidal lattice Zd × Zd [70]
whose set of points, W ≡{e−πiab/dZaXb| a, b ∈Zd}, forms the so-called Heisenberg-Weyl
group.
Note that, in contrast to the qubit Paulis, these are not self-adjoint (Hermitian) oper-
ators. In fact, they are unitary transformations, hence are rather the exponentials of some
Hermitian generators. In the next subsection we will see what are the Hermitian genera-
tors of these matrices, and brieﬂy mention how these generators appear in physical systems.
A useful property is that the linear combinations of elements in the Heisenberg-Weyl
group actually span the space of d × d matrices [9], and because these matrices are trace-
less (apart from the identity) and unitary, W forms an orthonormal basis with respect to
the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product6. This means that given any matrix operation on a
qudit, such as a general set of POVM operations, say {Mj}j, we can decompose Mj and
represent it as a superposition of elements in W: Mj = P
k cjkWk where {Wk}k ⊂W and
cjk ≡tr(MjW †
k).
Also note that when d is a prime number, the Z eigenbasis, and the XZm, m =
0, ..., d −1 eigenbases are all mutually unbiased [8], e.g.,
| ⟨j|xk⟩|2 = 1
d
∀j, k.
(2.23)
This gives us an example of how measuring in the wrong basis can result in no information
gained about a state; measuring an X eigenstate in the Z basis gives a uniformly random
result.
6Hilbert-Schmidt inner product: ⟨A, B⟩≡tr(AB†)

Finally, an important feature of these matrices is that they obey the following braiding
relation
ZX = υXZ = e2πi/dXZ.
(2.24)
Spin vs. spin-like generators
Now, as mentioned above, the Heisenberg-Weyl matrices are actually unitaries which are
not self-adjoint (Hermitian). Because they are unitaries, they necessarily have Hermitian
generators. As it turns out, the Z (phase) matrix is generated by a spin-like operator,
J ≡
d−1
X
k=0
k |k⟩⟨k| ,
where e2πiJ/d = Z.
(2.25)
If we compare it to the spin operators we see in physics, it is like a the spin matrix of
a “spin-(d −1)/2 particle”, i.e. a d-dimensional representation of a generator of SU(2). If
we let s ≡(d −1)/2, then we can write7
Jz =
s
X
k=−s
k |zk⟩⟨zk|
(2.26)
as the spin operator. Suppose we would like to compare the two generators, suppose we
let |zk⟩≡|k + (d −1)/2⟩, then
J = (d−1)
2
I + ˜J =⇒˜J = J −(d−1)
2
I.
(2.27)
Thus, for any unitary exponentiation of ˜J instead of Z,
e2πiθ ˜J/d = e2πi(d−1)θ/de2πiJ/d
(2.28)
we get an extra phase. This phase is important in the case of interactions, hence, when
we will make use of a “spin-like” operator for any qudits we use, we will be referring to ˜J
and not J.
Finally, to avoid confusion, note that although the z-spin operator from quantum me-
chanics, ˜J, is related to the generator of Z, note that the logarithm of the shift matrix X
7For d even, it is to be understood that the index of the of the sum are half-integer valued, and
that the sum is over the integer jumps from min to max values of the sum (e.g.
d = 4, s = 3/2,
Ps
k=−s k = −3/2 −1/ + 1/2 + 3/2). This is simply to have the same notation for all values of d.
10

unrelated to the x-spin Jx from quantum mechanics [67]. Also note that the X operator is
not quite like the raising operator J+ = Ps−1
m=−s Cjs |zj+1⟩⟨zj|, Cjs =
p
j(j + 1) −s(s + 1),
which is like a non-cyclical shifting operator which annihilate the state of the top eigenvalue
rather than shifting it back to the lowest eigenvalue.8
2.2.2
The Quantum Fourier transform for qubits
It is well-known that the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of n qubits results in an
exponentially large global Hilbert space, i.e. H ≡Nn
j=1 Hj ∼= C2n. Hence, one can have a
qudit Hilbert space of dimension d with only log2 d qubits.
Note that for the qudit representation, the Fourier transform mapped states as
|j⟩7→
1
√
d
d−1
X
k=0
e−2πijk/d |k⟩
(2.29)
and so, for a set of n qubits isomorphically equivalent to a 2n dimensional qudit, it can be
shown [51] that,
|j⟩7→
1
√
d
d−1
X
k=0
e−2πijk/d |k⟩∼= 2−n/2(|0⟩+e−2πi0.jn |1⟩)(|0⟩+e−2πi0.jn−1jn |1⟩)...(|0⟩+e−2πi0.j1...jn |1⟩)
(2.30)
where j = j12n−1 + ... + jn20 is the binary representation of the qudit state j.
The Fourier transform for qubits can be applied in a polynomial number of gates. These
gates are mostly Hadamard gates and controlled-rotations.
To understand controlled phase gates, consider a qubit A, which will serve as the control
register, and a qubit B, which will be the target. Then consider a generator of this unitary
given by
gAB = π21−n |1⟩⟨1|A ⊗|1⟩⟨1|B
(2.31)
then
UAB(θ) ≡e−igABθ = |0⟩⟨0|A ⊗I + |1⟩⟨1|A ⊗(|0⟩⟨0|B + e−2πiθ/2n |1⟩⟨1|B).
(2.32)
8Colloquially, Z and X are to a clock what Jz and J+ are to a ﬁnite-length ruler, both with a total
of d ticks (picture the eigenvalues of Z and Jz in the complex plane). For d = 2 (qubits), since there are
only two points (eigenvalues ±1), then one can consider it to be like a two-tick clock or a two-tick ruler.
11

By tuning the θ parameter depending on which qubit is interactng with which, we can use
such gates to achieve the quantum Fourier transform.
Essentially, a set of qubits can emulate a qudit eﬃciently, with suﬃcient control of the
qubits.
2.3
Phase estimation Algorithm
The phase estimation algorithm [51] involves performing a measurement on a certain target
system by using ancillary qubits and a unitary interaction to perform a POVM. We will use
this algorithm and its variants throughout this thesis, hence we will introduce it properly
here.
2.3.1
Algorithm
The phase estimation essentially relies on the property of qudits that F†ZF = X, that
is, a phase matrix Z = Pd−1
j=0 e2πij/d |j⟩⟨j| , gets converted to a cyclical shift of the state
X = Pd−1
j=0 |[j + 1]d⟩⟨j|. Note that n qubits are isomorphic to the Hilbert space of of a 2n
dimensional qudit, and that we can perform the qudit equivalent of the Fourier transform
eﬃciently on a set of n qubits.
Now, consider a controlled-phase gate, like those that are used in the quantum Fourier
transform. Suppose we have t ancillary qubits, then suppose we do controlled-unitaries, but
instead of having each unitary being generated by the Pauli phase gate (σz), the unitaries
are generated by a general observable in the target register. That is, consider unitaries of
the form
U = exp
 i 2π
d |1⟩⟨1| ⊗O

= |0⟩⟨0| ⊗I + |1⟩⟨1| ⊗e−i2π
d O
(2.33)
then, if the control register is in a uniform phaseless superposition of computational basis
states, i.e. an X eigenstate of eigenvalue 1, eigenstate; |+⟩, and say the target register is
in an eigenstate |ϕ⟩of O of eigenvalue ϕ, then
U |+⟩|ϕ⟩=
1
√
2
 |0⟩|ϕ⟩+ |1⟩e−i2πO |ϕ⟩

=
1
√
2
 |0⟩|ϕ⟩+ e−i2πϕ |1⟩|ϕ⟩

(2.34)
and we see that we we get an entangled state.
Now, if we scale up this intuition, consider the unitary
Ut =
t−1
Y
k=0
exp
 −2πi2k |1⟩⟨1|k ⊗O

(2.35)
12

acting on a tensor product of |+⟩states,
Ut |+⟩⊗t |ϕ⟩=

k=0

 −2πi2k |1⟩⟨1|k ⊗O

|+⟩⊗t |ϕ⟩=
1
2t/2
2t−1
X
k=0
e−2πiϕk |k⟩|ϕ⟩
(2.36)
where by |k⟩we mean its binary representation on the t control qubits. Now, for ϕ ∈Z,
we can recognize the above state as |xϕ⟩, hence if we apply the inverse quantum Fourier
transform to go back to the computational basis, we get
(F† ⊗I)Ut |+⟩⊗t |ϕ⟩= F† |xϕ⟩|ϕ⟩= |ϕ⟩|ϕ⟩.
(2.37)
and so measuring the control registers gives us the binary representation of ϕ.
Figure 2.1: Circuit diagram for the quantum phase estimation algorithm. The last register
represents the target register, made of some state on m qubits. The states of the ancillary
qubits are initialize in the computational default state. Following this a transversal (many
qubits in parallel) Hadamard is applied on the probes to put them in a uniform phaseless
superposition of all bit strings. Then, the controlled-unitaries are applied, they allow for
a target-state dependent phase to “kick back” (from the target to the control). Next, the
inverse Fourier transform is applied to convert the picked up phase into bit ﬂips. Finally,
a projective measurement in the standard basis is applied.
2.3.2
Information gain
Now, if the initial state of the target was a superposition of integer-eigenvalued eigenstates
of O, e.g.
|ψ0⟩=
X
j
λj |ϕj⟩
(2.38)
with ϕj ∈Z ∀j, then, by linearity of unitaries, we have
(F† ⊗I)Ut |+⟩⊗t |ψ0⟩=
X
j
λj |ϕj⟩|ϕj⟩
(2.39)
13

an entangled state between the control and the target, with the Schmidt decomposition
being in the eigenbasis of O. Thus, in this case we get an entanglement entropy
SAB = −
X
j
|λj|2 log2(|λj|2),
(2.40)
which is equal to the Shannon entropy of the measurement outcomes if we were to measure
the target register’s O observable by a direct projective measurement. In some sense the
ancillary system gained an amount of information about the target equal to the entangle-
ment entropy.
We considered performing the phase estimation algorithm for a certain observable O
with a discrete ﬁnite integer valued spectrum. Suppose we have a state |ϕ⟩for which the
ϕ ̸∈Z. Then, applying the phase estimation algorithm, we get
(F† ⊗I)Ut |+⟩⊗t |ϕ⟩≈| ˜ϕ⟩|ϕ⟩
(2.41)
where | ˜ϕ⟩is a good approximate value to |ϕ⟩. Essentially, the more bits we use, the larger
the spread over which we have our probe state, and hence when we Fourier transform it
the more spread it was (more qubits) the sharper the Fourier transform.
In order to get an accurate n-bit readout, then we need to use t qubits, for some
t > n, to run the algorithm, but we ignore the noisy t −n qubits’ readout at the end as
it is innacurate. It can be shown [51] that, to obtain an accurate n bit readout with a
probability of success > (1 −ϵ), we need to use at least
t = n + ⌈log(2 + (2ϵ)−1)⌉.
(2.42)
In this thesis, we will encounter system that have inﬁnite and continuous spectra. In
most cases we will counter the continuous with the continuous; we will use a continuous-
variable variant of the phase estimation algorithm (which we deﬁne in the lattice QET
chapter).
2.3.3
Deferred & Implicit Measurements
Note that performing a controlled gate, then projectively measuring the control register
in the standard basis, or the inverse order of these two are equivalent. this is known as
the principle of deferred measurement [51]. That is, a classical controlled gate with the
control being the result of a measurement versus a quantum control gate followed by a
14

measurement yield the same ﬁnal state. See ﬁgure 2.2
There is also the principle of implicit measurement [51], which states that for any
register that is not used after a certain point in the circuit, we can assume that it was
measured.
U

Figure 2.2: A measurement followed by a classical controlled unitary dependent on that
measurement (left) is equivalent to a quantum controlled unitary followed by a measure-
ment (right). In other words, measurements commute with controls. Note the double line
signiﬁes classical information (e.g. output of a measurement) while the single line means
quantum information.
Applications to QET
Thus, if we perform the phase estimation algorithm with a certain control register (the
ancillary register) and then use this register’s measurement result as the classical control
for a subsequent controlled unitary, then we can defer the measurement to the end of
the circuit, and replace the classical control with a quantum controlled unitary operation.
Furthermore, one the measurement is deferred to the end of the circuit, there is no need
to actually carry it out.
Thus, for the phase estimation followed by a controlled unitary combination, we can
let go of the measurement altogether and replace the circuit elements with their coherent
counterpart.
This is exactly what we will do for quantum energy teleportation; as we will see, this
protocol relies on a measurement, followed by a classically controlled unitary dependent
on the measurement. In this way, the protocol is LOCC; involves local operations and
classical communication.
In our treatment of quantum energy teleportation, we will use the alternate, but, as
justiﬁed above, equivalent version of the protocol, which is entirely coherent. Instead of
using a POVM, we model these measurements via phase estimation and an ancillary system.
15

Following this, instead of classical information being transferred from the measurement site
to the second target site, we transfer quantum information and apply a controlled unitary,
no measurement needed.
2.4
Continuous Variable Quantum Information
We will use the concepts in this section profusely when dealing with the numerical calcu-
lations for the harmonic lattice in a later chapter.
2.4.1
Gaussian States
Gaussian states [1] get their name from the fact that their Wigner pseudoprobability func-
tion is a Gaussian ∼e−1
2 ⃗XT σ−1 ⃗X, we see this is a Gaussian centered at the origin, which
means we are assuming that its quadrature expectation values µk ≡⟨xk⟩= 0 are null.
Here we are using the notation ⃗x ≡(q1, p1, q2, ..., pn)T. Now, since a normalized Gaussian
is uniquely speciﬁed by where it is centered and how wide it is, and that we have assumed
that our Gaussian is centered at the origin, then the so-called covariance matrix σ is single
object that speciﬁes our state. To ﬁnd the matrix elements of this σ, we compute the
so-called second moments
σ ≡1
2 ⟨xixj + xjxi⟩−

⟨xi⟩
⟨xj⟩
(2.43)
note that the commutation relations between the elements of ⃗x are
[xi, xj] = iΩij,
Ω=
M
k
 0
1
−1
0

.
(2.44)
What is particularly nice with Gaussian states is that since they are uniquely speciﬁed
by their ﬁrst and second moments, then eﬀectively we are using a much smaller space than
the full inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space to describe the states. This space is known as
phase space, denoted Γ. The phase space decomposes into direct sums for operators that
commute. Thus, instead of scaling exponentially with the number of systems, like the
Hilbert space, the phase space scales linearly.
16

2.4.2
Gaussian Operations
Unitaries generated by quadratic polynomials in the quadratures xj, xk, can be considered
as Gaussian operations. Gaussian unitary operations can be represented on phase space
by conjugating the covariance matrix and multiplying the ﬁrst moments with the phase
space representation of the given unitary.
Thus, instead of conjugating a density matrix with a unitary, U †ρU, we conjugate the
covariance matrix with a symplectic matrix S,
σ 7→STσS.
(2.45)
Matrices S are part of the symplectic group when they preserve the symplectic form
(matrix of commutators); STΩS = Ω.
In our work in this thesis we will often have to compute transformations of expectation
values of certain contractions of quadratures, e.g. say we consider a change in expectation
value an expectation value due to a symplectic transformation
⟨hjkxjxk⟩= hjk(˜Σjk + ˜µj ˜µk),
˜Σ ≡STΣS, ˜µ ≡STµ
(2.46)
where the ﬁrst and second moments are transformed according to the symplectic transfor-
mation.
This will be particularly useful for our computation of changes in energy due to Gaussian
operations in our chapter on QET in harmonic lattices.
2.4.3
Entanglement Entropy
Now, just like for Hermitian matrices there is a theorem stating that it can be real-
eigenvalue diagonalized using unitaries, there is a theorem for symplectic diagonalization
of matrices. This theorem, Williamson’s theorem [1], states that for any covariance matrix,
there exists a symplectic transformation which “symplectically diagonalizes” the matrix,
∃S ∈Sp(2N, R) :
STσS =
M
k
νk
νk

.
(2.47)
Now, these diagonal entries are called the symplectic eigenvalues, they can explicitly be
found by computing Eig+(iΩσ), that is, the positive eigenvalues (denoted Eig+) of the
matrix iΩσ, where Ωis the symplectic form as deﬁned in (2.44).
We can use these
symplectic eigenvalues to compute the entropy of the state as
S(ρ) =

2.5
Quantum Error Correction
Quantum Error correction is a mathematical theory which describes how to hide quantum
information in certain subspaces of a Hilbert space. Although we will not be treating this
topic directly in the main body of the thesis, we draw multiple parallels with concepts
underlying work that will appear later in this thesis.
2.5.1
From Hamiltonians to Subspaces
We will approach quantum error correction from an angle more familiar to physicist, that of
ground states of Hamiltonians. There are some proposed [40] implementations of quantum
computing which have been considered which eﬀectively use the degenerate ground state
space of a certain multi-qubit Hamiltonian to encode quantum information and protect it
from noise. Such Hamiltonians look like
H = −
n−k
X
j=1
gj,
[gi, gj] = 0
(2.49)
where each gj is some tensor product of n qubit Paulis; gj ∈Pn9 operators, e.g. X ⊗
X ⊗Z, and [gi, gj] = 0. Note that since each term is commuting, we can describe the
ground state of this Hamiltonian as the tensor product of pure +1 eigenvalue eigenstates
of each gi, tensor product with an arbitrary state for the rest of the Hilbert space |ψ⟩=
|ψcode⟩Nn−k
j=1 |gj⟩.
If our Hamiltonian has n −k such commuting terms, then we have
speciﬁed n−k eigenvalues out of a maximally commuting set of observables of n Paulis, then
we eﬀectively have k observables left to specify in order to fully specify a unique eigenstates.
The “vacant space” left in the Hilbert space is what is used to encode information, hence
in the above case there is a possibility to encode k qubits in the degenerate ground state,
which is what we express as |ψcode⟩.
Such systems are part of a more general scheme for quantum error correction in quantum
computing (theory describing how to correct for decoherence in quantum systems) called
the stabilizer formalism [24]. The rough idea is that a certain class of states are eigenstates
of tensor products of Paulis on n qubits. For such states, we can specify which n-qubit
Paulis for which they are a (+1)-eigenvalue eigenstate, and the group generated by products
of powers of these Paulis is called the Stabilizer group of a given state (for any element of
the stabilizer group, the state is a +1 eigenvalue eigenstate.
9or more generally Heisenberg-Weyl
18

Thus instead of working with the state in Dirac notation, we can simply work with
the operators for which a state is the +1 eigenvalue eigenstate. Since each Pauli can be
speciﬁed as ∼XaZb, a, b ∈Z2, then there are 2n bits to specify to describe each such state.
The set of unitary transformations which map tensor products of Paulis to tensor products
of Paulis is called the Cliﬀord group. In this sense, the stabilizer states are very much like
Gaussian states, but for discrete variables, the Cliﬀord group, as represented on the vector
space of 2n-bit strings (which themselves represent a state) is isomorphic to the symplectic
group on 2n bits, Sp(2n, Z2). In contrast, the group of Gaussian transformations on the
phase space of n harmonic oscillators is Sp(2n, R). We will draw many parallels between
continuous-variable Gaussian states and stabilizer states of qubits to some gain information
theoretic intuition.
2.5.2
Skew Subspaces
Now, note that the whole basic governing principle of quantum error correction is to
factorize our Hilbert space into a tensor product of skew-subspaces, that is, instead of
working in the physical factorization of the Hilbert space,
H =
n
O
j=1
Hj
(2.50)
where operators in Hj act on a single physical qubit, we work in a tensor product factor-
ization
H =
n
O
j=1
Hgj
(2.51)
where Hgj is the subspace of H which is the eigenspace of a stabilizer generator gj, and each
stabilizer generator is usually supported on more than one qubit, hence the “skewness” of
the subspace. In either case, the factorization is based on commuting sets of observables.
Note that in the phase space representation the commutation relation between Pauli oper-
ators [P, Q] can be seen as a symplectic inner product on the phase space (p, q) [24]. Thus,
when operators are commuting, they are orthogonal with respect the symplectic inner
product. We can then construct the phase space as a direct sum of orthogonal components
Γ = L
j Γgj = L
j Γj.
We will come back notion of Hilbert space factorization and associated phases spaces
in our discussion of quantum ﬁeld theory in section 5.2. Indeed, we will construct ways to
19

deal with certain skew-subspaces10 of quantum ﬁelds which become relevant when dealing
with probes interacting with the ﬁeld. In some sense, quantum error correction treats
algebras of observables which are aﬀected by decoherence, and in this thesis we provide the
decoherence; we couple external systems and study what information and which subsystem
of the quantum ﬁeld is aﬀected.
2.5.3
Correlations and Entanglement
In this section we discuss the structure of correlations and entanglement of stabilizer states
which will give us some intuition for some of our later work.
Suppose we have a stabilizer state |ψ⟩and a stabilizer group S ⊂Pn. Let N(S) be
the normalizer of the group, i.e. the Paulis which commute with elements of the stabilizer,
and let A(S) = Pn/N(S) be the Paulis that anti-commute with S.
If we consider a
correlator ⟨ψ|QR|ψ⟩then if QR ∈A(S) then using some g ∈S, we can show ⟨ψ|QR|ψ⟩=
⟨ψ|QRg|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|gQR|ψ⟩= 0. Similarly, for QR ∈N(S), we get either ⟨QR⟩= 1 or
a phase. Note that if we have no code space, i.e. when the stabilizer generators form a
maximal commuting set of observables, then correlators are non zero iﬀthey are in the
stabilizer group. So, if we act Q say on a subset A of qubits, and R on a subset B of qubits
for A and B disjoint, and Q and R are not in the normalizer individually, then we need a
stabilizer element that “bridges” A and B.
To further understand the structure of entanglement of stabilizer states, let us cover a
theorem by Fattal et al. [19]. This will show us that to compute the entanglement entropy
of a stabilizer state, one can ﬁnd a speciﬁc choice of generators for the stabilizer group of
the state. Once the right generators are found, then we can simply count the generators
that “bridge both parts of the Hilbert space, in this case, A and B.
We consider a pure stabilizer state |ψ⟩, and a Hilbert space H = HA ⊗HB. The given
prescription [19] is, given a bipartition of the Hilbert space of our state into A and B = ¯A,
10Why “skew”? By this we mean that if one looks at a certain subspace from a certain “angle” (Hilbert
space factorization), then the subspace looks “skewed” as it is non-orthogonal (orthogonality being deﬁned
as commutation of observables) to multiple operators. On the other hand, when one looks at the skew-
subspace in the right factorization, then it manifestly becomes a component orthogonal to the rest of the
Hilbert space.
20

there is a canonical choice for the generating set of S, given by
SA =
n
ai ⊗IB
(1 ≤i ≤|SA|)
SAB =
(
gA
k ⊗gB
k
(1 ≤k ≤|SAB|/2)
¯gA
k ⊗¯gB
k
(1 ≤k ≤|SAB|/2)
SB =
n
IA ⊗bj
(1 ≤i ≤|SB|)
(2.52)
where SA is the stabilizer subgroup which is strictly supported on A; generated by el-
ements ai ⊗IB, 1 ≤i ≤|SA| the rank of the subgroup, i.e. the size of its generating
set. Similarly, SB is the stabilizer group which is strictly supported on B, generated by
IA ⊗bj with j ≤|SB|. Finally the the subgroup SAB is the stabilizer subgroup generated
by elements which have support on both A and B. We can further split this subgroup
into two subgroups, where the elements of the ﬁrst subgroup are generated by elements
of the form gk ⊗gk, for which the projections onto A and B each commute with elements
of their respective subgroups, i.e. [gk, ai] = 0, [gk, bj] = 0 ∀i, j, k. The rest of SAB is
generated by elements whose projections anticommute with the local stabilizer subgroups,
¯gk ⊗¯gk such that {¯gk, ai} = 0, {¯gk, bj} = 0 ∀i, j, k. Note that the index k runs from
1 ≤k ≤p ≡|SAB|/2.
The theorem from Fattal et al. states that the entanglement entropy for the bipartition
AB is given by |SAB|/2. In this paper they give a counting argument for why the entangle-
ment entropy is given by this quantity. I will give an intuitive explanation instead, related
to entanglement distillation.
First, notice that a maximally entangled state of two qubits |Φ+⟩∼|00⟩+ |11⟩is
stabilized by ⟨XX, ZZ⟩. Also note that we can deﬁne any map between Paulis to Paulis,
and as long as it preserves commutation relations there will exist a unitary Cliﬀord circuit
that implements it. Given the canonical decomposition from equation 2.52, consider the
projections of the stabilizer group onto A, call it S|A.
Let us deﬁne a speciﬁc Cliﬀord unitary (local on A) UA, which maps S|A to some new
stabilizer group, call it ˜S|A. We deﬁne this map as
UA : S|A
→˜S|A
(2.53)
UA : gk
7→Zk,
1 ≤k ≤|SAB|/2
(2.54)
UA : ¯gk
7→Xk,
1 ≤k ≤|SAB|/2
(2.55)
UA : ai
7→Z˜i,
˜i = i + nA −|SA|,
1 ≤i ≤|SA|,
(2.56)
21

which gives us |SA| single qubits that are in a |0⟩state (stabilized by Z) and |SAB|/2
qubits that need to be stabilized by both X and Z, hence are maximally mixed states
(XIX = I, ZIZ = I). If we do the same construction for B, i.e. deﬁne a mapping
UB : S|B 7→˜SB, we can consider the map U ≡UA ⊗UB, and deﬁne ˜S ≡USU †, we get
|SAB/2| Bell pairs (pairs of qubits with stabilizers XX, ZZ) and the rest of the qubits are
tensor products of pure |0⟩. Clearly, the entanglement entropy is then given by |SAB|/2,
using unitaries that are local on A and B, we were able to distill this entanglement from
the stabilizer state.
Thus as we see, given entanglement of stabilizer states due to there being a choice of
stabilizer generators which cross the bipartition of the Hilbert space, there is a certain
choice of stabilizer generators for the state which allow us to read oﬀthe entanglement
entropy, and which decomposes the state into a direct product of Bell pairs. One could
regard this decomposition as equivalent to ﬁnding the Schmidt basis of the state. Addition-
ally, we discussed that there is a Cliﬀord transformation which takes us to this factorization.
Relation to other work in this thesis
Now, in our future/ongoing work section 7.1, we will try to apply this construction to
understand the mode structure of the quantum ﬁeld for a given bipartition of the Hilbert
space.
Instead of looking at stabilizers, we will look at algebras of observables of the
ﬁeld, and we will want to optimize over symplectic (Bogolyubov) transformations on A
and its complement independently to come up with a set of modes which are eﬀectively
continuous-variable bell pairs (i.e. two-mode squeezed states). Similar to the fact that the
choice of Cliﬀord here gave us the Schmidt basis for the AB bipartition, we will be able
to ﬁnd a Schmidt basis for the Hilbert space of a quantum ﬁeld given a bipartition in the
physical factorization.

Chapter 3
Quantum Energy Teleportation
Essentials
In this chapter we introduce the protocol of quantum energy teleportation (QET), originally
introduced by Hotta [30, 29, 28, 31, 32, 33, 49, 34, 35, 31, 23, 36, 68].
3.1
Introduction to QET
Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a protocol that allows the the transfer of energy
from one subsystem to another in correlated many-body quantum systems (and quantum
ﬁelds). Given a certain entangled state of an interacting many-body quantum system, say,
an eigenstate of an interacting Hamiltonian, then subsystems (A & B) usually share some
mutual information, I(A : B) due to this entanglement. This mutual information means
that there exists certain observables on A and B which are correlated. QET aims to exploit
these correlations in order to eﬀectively transfer energy.
3.1.1
Harnessing Correlations
Correlated many body systems, as their name suggests, have correlated observables. This
means that sampling the eigenvalue of one observable should give information about cor-
related ones. As mutual information bounds correlations between observables, if there is
some mutual info one should usually have correlated observables.
23

The whole protocol of QET relies on exploiting correlations in order to do what is
otherwise unlikely: extract energy from states which locally look like a ground state (or
strongly locally passive states [22]). The trick here, is to invest energy in order to get some
payback. In some sense, QET is a gambling game, where energy is the currency and one
player sacriﬁces earnings for another to proﬁt.
By measuring an observable in a certain subsystem, call it A, that observable will be
correlated with some observables in subsystem B.
Given an observable of B which is
correlated with our measured observable in A, if this B observable has some inﬂuence on
the energy of the system, them we will be able to use the knowledge of the eigenvalue of
A to statistically infer an expected value of B, then displace this value in a way to extract
energy. For locally passive systems, this would not be possible by acting on B on its own;
there is local uncertainty about the state at B, hence without any additional knowledge,
any attempt at locally displacing the eigenvalue of an energetically-contributing observable
would increase the energy of the system. In some sense, collapsing the state at A partially
collapses the state at B and any other region which is correlated with A. This collapse
allows us to catch the B subsystem in a conditional state which is diﬀerent than the usual
marginal state, this state suddenly has some new “free energy”, i.e., the new state can be
displaced in a way to extract energy.
3.1.2
Measurement is the Key
Note that QET does not actually generate energy out of the vacuum, the gain of informa-
tion comes at a cost, an energetic one. Indeed, carrying out a projective measurement or
POVM, one breaks correlations of the ground state. These correlations served an energetic
minimization purpose, otherwise they would not have been there. Thus, correlating a sub-
system with some measurement apparatus, thereby breaking correlations of this subsystem
with its previous environment, injects energy. Thus, although measurement is the key to
unlock to ability to teleport energy, it is not free.
3.1.3
Global vs. local energy optima
The global minimum energy state is by deﬁnition the ground state. But the ground state
is not the minimal energy state if one looks only at a subsystem. In some sense, the ground
state is the global equilibrium, but locally a certain state could reduce its energy if a dif-
ferent correlated subsystem would be willing to increase its energy. As spin chains and
24

quantum ﬁelds and most condensed matter systems are assumed to have spatially transla-
tionally symmetric couplings (all the couplings in a chain are often deﬁned as identitical),
then no single subsystem wins over other subsystems, an overall energetic compromise is
reached. On the other hand, if one were to modify the coupling of the chain to favor a
certain subset, e.g. by adding quadratic quadrature terms in a Hamiltonian, thus changing
the new ground state to a squeezed state, then one could get peaks and troughs of en-
ergy instead of uniform compromise. Indeed, it is known that certain squeezed states can
have negative energy densities. Eﬀectively, as we will show, QET is a way of performing
non-local squeezing operations via the coupling of probe systems.
3.1.4
Previous Works
There have been numerous pieces of work done on QET,[30, 29, 28, 31, 32, 33, 49, 34, 35,
31, 23, 36, 68]. In its introduction, the focus was on spin chains and many-body systems.
Following this, QET has been shown to work for scalar quantum ﬁeld theories as well as
in quantum electrodynamics.
The next frontier for QET was to understand how the structure of the Hilbert space
allowed for QET, and to ﬁnd the optimal measurement schemes for QET. Although some
work was done using POVM’s made to emulate interactions with higher dimensional Hilbert
spaces, the optimal measurement scheme was still elusive.
This thesis
This is where our work in this thesis begins. We propose new measurement schemes based
on generalizations of the phase estimation algorithm in order to optimize the measurement
for QET, thus allowing for better collection of information and therby greater teleportation
of energy.
Additionally, we provide fully coherent (POVM/PVM-free) versions of the QET, which,
as was discussed in the background section, is equivalent to the LOCC version of the
protocol.
Some work had shown, in the case of the simplest QET model, minimal QET, that
the key to a good QET measurement was the breaking of entanglement between the mea-
surement site and the rest of the system. To begin our study of QET and entanglement
breaking, we start with an in-depth analysis of the coherent (projective-measurement-free)
version of the minimal QET protocol.
25

3.2
Coherent Minimal QET
In this section we go through how to implement a measurement-free version of minimal
QET with an ancillary qubit and two-qubit gates. We show that the energy extraction
procedure increase the entanglement of the target region, while the measurement breaks
the entanglement of its target.
3.2.1
The Global Ground State
Before we write out the ground state for minimal QET, it will be useful for our later
purposes to intuitively explain how on obtains the ground state of the minimal QET
Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian for minimal QET is given by
H = hσzA
|{z}
HA
+ hσzB
|{z}
HB
+ kσxAσxB
|
{z
}
V
(3.1)
where h, k > 0. We are looking to ﬁnd |g⟩, the lowest energy eigenstate of H. Note that
since [HA, HB] = 0, the free Hamiltonians are simultaneously diagonalizable, and we know
that the ground state of HA + HB must be1 |11⟩. So in the limit k/h →0, we expect
|g⟩→|11⟩, with an energy eigenvalue −2h. Conversely, the ground state of V is the Bell
state |Φ−⟩=
1
√
2(|00⟩−|11⟩), hence in the limit k/h →∞, we should have |g⟩→|Φ−⟩with
energy eigenvalue −2k.
Now, we are looking for the global ground state of H = HA + HB + V , we intuitively
could expect it2 to be some sort of convex combination of both ground states of (HA +HB)
and V , which are |00⟩and |Φ−⟩∼|00⟩−|11⟩. Notice that this state will then be on a
Bloch-like circle |g⟩∈{α |00⟩+ β |11⟩: α, β ∈R, α2 + β2 = 1}. We thus can expect our
global ground state to be of the form
|g⟩= sin( θ
2) |00⟩−cos( θ
2) |11⟩.
(3.2)
From our previous intuition, we would like θ →0 as k/h →0 and θ →π
2 as k/h →∞, we
know a function that does this, the arctan function. As it turns out, the guess
θ = arctan( k
h)
(3.3)
1I follow the notation convention of quantum computing, i.e. σz |j⟩= (−1)j |j⟩for j ∈{0, 1}, σx |±⟩=
± |±⟩, σx |j⟩= |¬j⟩, where ¬j is the logical negative of j; ¬ : 0 ↔1.
2This approach of convex combinations may not always work for general Hamiltonians, but in this case
it does and provides good intuition.
26

is the right one.
To show this, we can minimize our expectation value of the global
Hamiltonian over our θ parameter.

Figure 3.1: Bloch-type circle to represent the possible ground states for various values of
h and k. Intuitively, the two σz terms (of energetic ’weight’ h each) are pushing for a
|11⟩ground state, while the interaction term V is pushing for the |Φ+⟩state (with an
energetic ’weight’ of 2k). Representing this on the Bloch ”circle”, there is a force of 2k
pushing left, and a force of 2h pushing down, the equilibrium is reached at the point of
angle θ = arctan(2k/2h), with energy −
p
(2h)2 + (2k)2.
As one can verify, we get the same answer as Hotta [34].
Preparing the ground state
As an aside, it is interesting to see how one could prepare the ground state from two
initialized qubits, as we can simply apply the inverse operations to recover two initialized
qubits from the ground state. Note that this ground state can be prepared from the |00⟩
state by using two gates. First a rotation about Y of the A qubit, exp(i (θ−π)
2
σyA) ⊗IB,
then apply CNOT with A as the control and B the target. So,
|00⟩AB 7→(sin( θ
2) |0⟩A −cos( θ
2) |1⟩A) |0⟩B 7→(sin( θ
2) |00⟩AB −cos( θ
2) |11⟩AB).
(3.5)
Note that, alternatively, we can also get to the ﬁnal state with a single interaction, U =
exp(i (θ−π)
2
σyA ⊗σyB).
27

3.2.2
The Protocol
Pre-Alice
Consider two qubits (A and B) with the minimal QET Hamiltonian discussed above,
suppose we have access to a pure ancillary register, call it C. For our purposes, this register
eﬀectively acts as a measurement/control device, the value of the bit in the register acts as
a measurement pointer variable. For simplicity, we consider the control register C to have
no free Hamiltonian. Suppose the initial state of the system is
|Ψ0⟩≡|g⟩AB |0⟩C ,
(3.6)
for further purposes, it will be useful to express the ground state as follows:
|g⟩=
X
j∈{0,1}
γj |jj⟩AB =
1
√
2
X
±
|±⟩A |ϕ±⟩B
(3.7)
where γ0 ≡sin(θ/2), γ1 ≡−cos(θ/2), and |ϕ±⟩≡P
j=0,1(±1)jγj |j⟩.
Let S(θ) ≡−P
j |γj|2 log(|γj|2), the mutual information between registers A and B is
of I(A : B)Ψ0 = 2S(θ) = 2H(B)Ψ0.
Post-Alice
Alice applied a CNOT gate with C as the control (in X basis, apply Hadamard on C ﬁrst)
and A the target
|Ψ1⟩=
1
√
2
X
±
|±⟩A |ϕ±⟩B |±⟩C .
(3.8)
Note that the mutual information between A and B has been halved, I(A : B)Ψ1 = S(θ) =
H(B)Ψ1, on the other hand the entropy of B is unaﬀected. This is because the interaction
converted bipartite entanglement to tripartite entanglement.
In this way, the measurement by Alice has broken the entanglement A had with its
complement, B. Entanglement breaking via measurement was pinpointed by Hotta [27] as
a sign of a good measurement for QET.
28

Post-Bob
Bob applies a controlled-Y rotation on B using C as the control, U = exp(i 1
2(φ −θ)σxC ⊗
σyB) where φ ≡arctan(2k/h) (we rotate B to the local ground state3 The ﬁnal state is
given by
|Ψ2⟩=
1
√
2
X
±
|±⟩A |Υ±⟩B |±⟩C .
(3.9)
where |Υ±⟩= P
j=0,1 µj |j⟩with µ0 ≡sin(φ/2), µ1 ≡−cos(φ/2).
Note that as long
as k > 0, we necessarily have | ⟨ϕ+|ϕ−⟩|2 > | ⟨Υ+|Υ−⟩|2, hence the states have become
more orthogonal/more distinguishable. On the other hand the entropy of B has become
H(B)Ψ2 = S(φ) > S(θ) = H(B)Ψ1 = H(B)Ψ0 so the ﬁnal step of QET actually increases
the entropy of B. An option to purify B instead would be to replace Φ in our unitary by
0, that way the B register would be sent to the |1⟩state instead.
Thus, we see that we in fact increase the entanglement of the target region when we
extract energy. This is a result that we will also recover when we study the QET protocol
for a lattice of harmonic oscillators.
3.3
General Mutli-observable QET Algorithm
Now that we have covered the basic example of minimal QET in the coherent picture, we
can generalize our approach. In this section we describe our generalized QET algorithm
which is designed to optimally harness correlations between subsystems.
For ease of language, we will refer to the global system as a lattice, but it will be
applicable to quantum ﬁeld theory, as we will show later.
Now, let {Qj}j∈A and {Rk}k∈B be sets of maximally commuting observables for sub-
systems A and B.
Consider a set of systems C which is of the same dimension as subsystem A; i.e.
it is isomorphic (in general we want C’s Hilbert space to be big enough to contain A’s
information, this is also achievable asymptotically with a set of qubits). Now, the algorithm
goes as follows:
3This 2k/h comes from the fact that the local Hamiltonian for B is HB + V instead of HA + HB +
V , therefore, one can mi minimize the local energy by adjusting the angle θ = arctan(2k/2h) to φ =
arctan(2k/h).
29

• Perform the phase estimation algorithm, minus the measurement, to measure observ-
ables {Qj}j∈A using the systems C as the ancillary registers
• Alice transfers the control system C to Bob coherently
• Bob applies a set of control unitaries, with the C systems as the controls, with the
unitaries being the conjugate variable4 to the {Rk}k∈B. The speciﬁc choice of each
unitary rotation’s angle5 has to be optimized to maximize energy output.
This is eﬀectively a controlled displacement of Bob’s Rk values, conditioned on the Qj’s
(whose Q information was carried by the probe).
In this way, Bob uses all of Alice’s information about her Q variables. Bob eﬀectively
uses multipoint correlation information to infer the eigenvalue of his observables given
Alice’s information.
Note that, even with all of this optimization, Alice and Bob could further optimize
their choice of observables for the protocol. Stronger correlations are favourable, but how
each observable aﬀects the Hamiltonian is also important.
We eﬀectively perform this protocol in our chapter on QET with a lattice and in our
section on multipoint QET in our QET in quantum ﬁeld theory chapter.
Note that, as was explained in our quantum information background section, that this
protocol still is equivalent to the LOCC version; Alice could instead measure her ancillary
registers to complete the phase estimation and send the classical data to Bob, who would
perform unitaries on his system dependent on this classical data.
4For example, if Rk = πk, then the controlled unitary is generated by φk; because [φk, πk] = i.

Chapter 4
QET on Harmonic Lattices
4.1
Introduction
In this chapter we will be covering a variant of the Quantum Energy Teleportation protocol
for linear harmonic lattices. Lattices of Harmonic oscillators oﬀer, to a good approximation,
a model of a quantum ﬁeld [15]. In particular, if one is restricted to a certain class of
states, namely, Gaussian states, then this lattice is fully and eﬃciently simulatable using
(classical) numerics. Using the power of the Gaussian state formalism, expectation values
of operators, Gaussian state transformations, and entropies are fairly straightforward to
compute. We will be putting this formalism to use in this chapter.
In this chapter, we ﬁrst introduce the mathematical formalism for dealing with linear
harmonic lattices.
Following this, we propose a novel variant of the quantum energy
teleportation protocol for harmonic chains which relies on using Harmonic Oscillators as
the measurement probe system and Gaussian unitaries to entangle the probe to the system
and eﬀectively perform a measurement. We will cover how our speciﬁc choice of Gaussian
interactions is akin to a continuous-variable version of the phase estimation algorithm from
quantum computing.
Note that there having been previous iterations of Quantum Energy Teleportation
for linear Harmonic chains [49], however our measurement scheme and energy extracting
procedure provides and improvement over previous iterations. Indeed, via our continuous-
variable version of the phase estimation algorithm, we eﬀectively perform near-projective
POVM measurements on the quadratures of multiple oscillators, whereas the scheme by
31

Nambu and Hotta [49] used a “weaker” type of measurement1. We then use this multi-
point quadrature information and the knowledge of the correlations of the chain to predict
the quadrature values for multiple sites in the energy extraction target region, instead of
only a single site in previous iterations.
Additionally, the version of our protocol we present in this section oﬀers a coherent
alternative to other protocols which require projective or POVM measurements. Instead
of using the POVM formalism, we use probe systems with Gaussian unitary interactions,
hence given that Alice and Bob can share quantum information, there is no need for any
measurement. We discuss how this protocol is still equivalent to the LOCC version.
Note that the numerical results in this chapter (section 4.3.4) were obtained in collab-
oration Jason Pye.
4.2
Background: Harmonic Lattices
Let us start with a slightly more concrete example of a 1-D linear periodic harmonic chain,
then we will study the formalism for a general lattice.
4.2.1
1-D harmonic chain
Let N be the number of quantum harmonic oscillators in our chain.
Say we have N
independent harmonic oscillators, then the Hamiltonian of the system would be

each site:

πj ≡bj −b†

(4.2)
and all of these obey the usual canonical commutation relations. In the above case, the
ground state of our system would be the product state |0⟩= N
j |0j⟩, which is a separable

basis hence the POVM operators are highly non-orthogonal.
32

state and is not very interesting for our purposes. What is needed for there to be correla-
tions is ground state entanglement. As we will soon see, we need correlations in order to
have any possibility of performing the quantum energy teleportation protocol. What we
need to add to our Hamiltonian are couplings between the harmonic oscillators in order to
get a ground state that is a squeezed state between the sites.
Consider the following Hamiltonian for our system, now with added couplings forming
a 1-D periodic harmonic chain [49]:
H = 1
2
N
X
i,j=1
(π2
j + φiKijφj) ≡1
2
X
j∈ZN
(φ2
j + π2
j −αφjφj−1),
(4.3)
where the sum is over indices modulo N (hence the periodicity of our chain). Borrowing
some linear algebra from our knowledge of quantum computing, we see that K is clearly
I −αX, where X is the generalized Pauli matrix for d = N. The shift matrix appears
here because the physical topology of our set of harmonic oscillators is like that of a
N- tick clock (the topology being deﬁned the couplings of our harmonic oscillators 2).
The way to diagonalize K = I −αX would be the discrete Fourier transform, K =
I −αX = F(I −αZ)F†. This Fourier transform gives us the Fourier (normal) modes’
ladder operators, which we will label {ak, a†
k}k∈ZN. These are constructed in a way such
that they obey the usual commutation relations [ak, a†
k′] = δkk′, all the while diagonalizing
the Hamiltonian. We can express the individual sites’ quadratures in terms of these global
Fourier ladder operators

Aside: Ground State as squeezing
Although we will not use this formalism for our calculations, it is interesting to see how
one could ﬁnd the way each individual oscillator is squeezed with other oscillators to form
the ground state of the chain. The ground state of our Hamiltonian is a squeezed state
that is of the form

This form can be insightful, as it allows one to see exactly how each harmonic oscillator
is squeezed with each other harmonic oscillator (more on this later). Although obtaining
the above expression is non-standard practice, let us try to see how one would get the λjm
coeﬃcients. Using an approach which works for general multimode squeezed states [60],
using block matrix notation, we can see that in our case our Bogolyubov transformation
(which we can represent as linear map in 2N dimensional phase space) gives

(4.9)
34

where f is the logarithm of the discrete Fourier transform [6], σx and σz are the usual 2×2
Paulis. Let us make sense of this equation, recall that the Hadamard matrix (diagonalizes
σx) is the one that takes us from (b, b†)T 7→(φ, π)T, so partially inverting the above equation
using the Hadamard on the blocks, we have

Now, we are ready to express our ground state as a multi-oscillator squeezing, let
Λ ≡1
2(σZ ⊗I) ln(M),
(4.11)
since M is the product of two exponentials, one way to compute this would be using the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀformula3 [4]. then our squeezed ground state can be represented
as

The coeﬃcients in the bottom left block of Λ would then give us the coeﬃcients for λjm,
which tell us exactly what is entangled with what; the squeezing operator can be seen as
one that simultaneously increases the particle count of both site j and site m by an amount
dependent on the amplitude of λmk.
Covariance Matrix
Since our Hamiltonian is quadratic, its ground state is a Gaussian state, hence to fully
characterize it all we need to do is compute the ﬁrst and second moments of this state.

where L is a general index set for our lattice sites. We have the usual commutation relations
[φi, πj] = iδij,
[φi, φj] = [πi, πj] = 0.
(4.17)
If we desire, we can write the ground state wavefunction, which is given [15] by
⟨⃗φ|0⟩=

2 ⃗φT W ⃗φ
(4.18)
where W ≡

K. Instead of working with the wavefunction itself, we can use the Gaussian
state formalism. For this, all we have to compute are the ﬁrst and second moments. The
ﬁrst moments vanish, while the second moments are the symmetrized correlators, the latter
of which are given by
⟨φjφk⟩≡Gjk = 1

4.3
Harmonic chain QET
In this section, we will consider applying the quantum energy teleportation protocol to a
1-D linear harmonic chain of oscillators, as we have introduced in this chapter.
Although QET on a linear harmonic chain has been studied before [49], we will be
modifying the protocol to include a new measurement technique and interaction which will
substantially improve the eﬃcacy of information collection and thus the teleported energy.
This measurement technique is inspired from the phase estimation algorithm, it will serve
as a continuous-variable version of it.
4.3.1
Continuous-variable phase estimation
Intuition: Discrete vs. Continuous Variable Phase estimation
As we have seen for the discrete-variable phase estimation algorithm, the goal is to use
the qudit as a pointer variable whose state (as measured in the standard basis) at the
end of the protocol tells us the eigenvalue of a certain observable in the target register.
Just as the X and Z eigenbases of a qudit are “conjugate”, in the sense that the Fourier
transform takes us from one basis to the other, the X and P, or φ and π eigenbases of an
oscillator’s Hilbert space are conjugate bases. Thus, as the phase estimation is essentially
a controlled-X gate for a qudit (an adder gate), we can do the same for the continuous-
variable system. For discrete-variable phase estimation, we ﬁrst start our ancillary (probe)
system in the |0⟩state, and say we have the target system in a |Ψ⟩T = P
j |oj⟩T state, where
the |oj⟩states are eigenstates of an observable of interest OT = P
j oj |oj⟩⟨oj|. The usual
phase estimation algorithm starts with H⊗n for qubits, the transversal Hadamard, which
maps |0⟩7→
1
√
d
P
j ψj |j⟩. Instead, we can use the Fourier transform, which maps this
37

speciﬁc initial state the same way F |0⟩=
1
√
d
P
j |j⟩. Following this, a controlled-unitary
(controlled phase) between the control and target systems is applied
U = e−iOT ⊗z =
X
j
|oj⟩⟨oj| ⊗Zoj,
(4.23)
where4 z ≡−P
j
2π
d is the generator of Z. Following this, an inverse Fourier transform is
applied onto the control system, F†. At this point, the control’s system’s state as measured
in the standard basis is entangled with the system,
(I ⊗F†)U(I ⊗F) |Ψ⟩T |0⟩C =
1
√
d
X
j
ψj |oj⟩T |j⟩C
(4.24)
which is the desired entangled state. Notice that we have eﬀectively conjugated the con-
trolled by the Fourier transform for the control system, this turns the controlled-phase gate
into a controlled-adder:
(I ⊗F†)e−iOT ⊗z(I ⊗F) =
X
j
|oj⟩⟨oj| ⊗F†ZojF =
X
j
|oj⟩⟨oj| ⊗Xoj.
(4.25)
This is the fundamental property that we will carry over to the continuous variable version
of this algorithm: the usual combination of Fourier transforms and a controlled-phase gate
can be replaced by an adder gate. When the control system is a set of qubits emulating a
qudit, it makes sense to use the controlled phase gate as its Hamiltonian decomposed into
a sum of single-qubit spin operators. The nonlocality (between qubits) is delegated to the
post-processing (Fourier transforms), rather than the interaction with the target system,
which is preferable and physically more feasible.
Now, as for the continuous-variable version of this controlled-adder gate. We can initial-
ize a control “register” (oscillator) in a near-φ-eigenstate5 (i.e. a very squeezed state), and
apply a controlled-displacement (translation of the state in phase space) which displaces
the control according to the eigenvalue of a certain observable.
In practical scenarios,
the φ eigenstate is unphysical; it would require inﬁnite energy to prepare a harmonic oscil-
lator in this state. We will thus study approximate φ eigenstates, which are squeezed states.
4We covered in our quantum information basis section what happens when the eigenvalues of the
observable are non-integers for phase estimation. We get a bit of noise but by increasing the dimensions
of the qudit we can reduce this noise.
5Here we denote φ as a quadrature of the control oscillator.
38

One can think of the control register as a “meter” with a “needle” of a certain thickness
(given by the degree of squeezing of our control state) which, when the meter is coupled
to a target system, moves according to the value being measured. As one can only read
the value of the meter’s needle up to a precision given by the needle’s thickness, a sharper
needle gives more information about the system. The amount of information gained by
the control system is quantiﬁed by the post-measurement mutual information between the
target system and the control register. In the case where we have a pure state for the
target system (e.g. ground state of some system) then the mutual information will simply
be twice the entanglement entropy for the system/probe bipartition of the Hilbert space.
Finally, as there is no phase transfer and Fourier transform in the case of the continuous
variable protocol, the name “phase estimation” may not be the best choice for a description
of the inner workings of the protocol, but, as it was inspired by the discrete variable
protocol,
Using Gaussian Operations
Now, let us get more speciﬁc in our construction of this measurement procedure, sup-
pose we have an oscillator as the target register, and suppose we would like to measure
some quadrature observable of this oscillator. As a ﬁnite-energy approximation to an φ
eigenstate, we can initialise the control oscillator’s state in a Gaussian state that is highly
squeezed in π, centered at φ = 0,
|ξ⟩C = exp(1
2ξc†2 −1
2ξc2) |0⟩C
(4.26)
where c ≡
1
√
2(φ + iπ) is the control oscillator’s ladder operator, and ξ ≡eiϕr, is the
squeezing parameter, with r ∈R+. Note that [4] for a single-oscillator squeezed state, the
squeezing parameter ξ = reiϕ, the quadrature variances are
⟨ξ| X2ϕ
2
|ξ⟩= 1
2e2r,
⟨ξ| X2ϕ
2 + π
2
|ξ⟩= 1
2e−2r
(4.27)
where
Xθ ≡ae−iθ + a†eiθ
2
,
X = X0,
Xϕ
2 + π
2 = P
(4.28)
hence what we want is a ξ ∈R−, i.e. ϕ = π and ξ = −r. In the limit of r →∞, we
converge towards an eigenstate of the position φ with eigenvalue 0, i.e. nearing a constant
wavefunction with inﬁnite spread in momentum. Of course any inﬁnitely squeezed state is
unphysical, hence we will consider our parameter to be ﬁnite and see how our results scale
39

with r.
Now, with this |ξ⟩state as the control, we can consider how to use it to measure a
certain observable of the target oscillator. In our protocol, the observable of interest will
be some quadrature of the harmonic oscillator, which, for this example, we assume is in
some Gaussian state with null ﬁrst moments and with covariance matrix σ. Suppose we
want to measure φT of the target oscillator, then, we can apply the following Gaussian
operation to entangle the control and the target
U1 = exp (−iλ φT ⊗πC) ,
(4.29)
where λ is some real constant. As the above unitary is generated, one can fairly easily
obtain a representation of this transformation on phase space using our knowledge of the
Gaussian state formalism, as discussed in the previous chapter. The eﬀective transforma-
tion on phase space is


(4.30)
and we see that for the φ quadratures, the target’s value gets added (times the coupling)
to the control’s, whereas for the π quadratures, the control’s is added to the target. In
some sense, depending on which quadrature we look at, one system can be considered the
control and the other one target, while if we look at the conjugate quadrature the role of
control register and target are inverted.
We will sometimes refer to the above as an “adder” gate for continuous variables. This
gate is akin to the controlled-NOT gate in quantum computing [51] and the controlled-X
gate for qudits.
Now, essentially, because of our choice of initial state, ⟨ξ|φC|ξ⟩= 0 the expectation value
of φ for the control register is null, while the variance in φ is very small; ⟨ξ|φ2
C|ξ⟩= 1
2e−2r.
Thus, if we measured the control register’s φC eigenvalue post-interaction, we will eﬀectively
measure λφT plus exponentially small noise.
Equivalent POVM and Entanglement Breaking
We can show that the continuous-variable adder gate deﬁned above can be used to near-
projectively measure the φ observable of the target. Suppose our initial state of the target
40

register is given by |ψ⟩T, then suppose we do the interaction U1, followed by a projective
measurement of the φC. If we measure an eigenvalue φ′ for the control register, then the
eﬀective operation is the Kraus operator
Vφ′ ≡(⟨φ′|C ⊗IT)U1 |ξ⟩C =
Z
dφ ⟨φ′| e−iλφπC |ξ⟩C |φ⟩⟨φ|T

(4.31)
we see that it is a Gaussian integral of projectors, with a Gaussian of variance e−2r/λ,
which converges to a delta function centered on φ′/λ in the limit of r →∞. Thus, we
converge exponentially fast into a projective measurement for the target register as we
increase the squeezing parameter.
Taking a projective measurement on a set of oscillators aﬀects other oscillator’s quadra-
ture expectation value elsewhere, as is the very nature of Gaussian correlations. Consider
the wavefunction decomposition of the ground state, (4.18)

|W|
π
Z
dn⃗φe−1
2 ⃗φT W ⃗φ |⃗φ⟩
(4.32)
and the fact that W =
√
K is not diagonal means that we have correlations, and ultimately
entanglement. Then, if we project some oscillators in some subsystem A, which has |A| ≡a,
say, |⃗ϕ⟩⟨⃗ϕ| with ⃗ϕ ∈Ra, then let ⃗φ⊥∈Rn−a be the components of ⃗φ not in A, the state
becomes
|⃗ϕ⟩⟨⃗ϕ|0⟩=

and we see that we have factorized out a chunk of the state, hence we necessarily have
broken the entanglement of A with its complement.
We also see that the wavefunc-
tion on ¯A is shifted by an amount dependent on the measured ⃗ϕ, because of the fac-
tors exp(−1
2 ⃗ϕTWA ¯
A⃗φ⊥) exp(−1
2⃗φT
⊥W ¯
AA⃗ϕ), which depend on the blocks WA ¯
A, which are the
blocks which correlate A with it’s environment6. Note there is still some “noise” remain-
ing, manifested in the form of the term exp −1
2⃗φT
⊥W ¯
A ¯
A⃗φ⊥which looks like the ground state
restricted to ¯A and is completely independent of our measured values on A. Recall that
the correlators themselves are ∼W ±1/2, hence we see that correlations are at play here by
shifting the expectation value.
6To ﬁnd the shift we could complete the square in the Gaussian
41

This shift in expected value in the complement of a region for which we measure the
quadratures is exactly the principle we will use to perform quantum energy teleportation.
Given a measurement on A, we will use this information to infer the expectation value of
the quadratures in a subsystem B, and use this information advantage over the ground
state to attenuate the ﬂuctuations in B.
4.3.2
The protocol
Let us outline our QET protocol. First, we have the system begin in the ground state of
a linear harmonic chain of the type we have been discussing in this chapter (N oscillators
with periodic boundary conditions, nearest-neighbor φ-φ couplings). We then measure,
using the continuous variable phase estimation algorithm outlined above, the φ quadra-
ture of each oscillator within a certain subsystem, call it A, of our spin chain. Supposing
there are |A| oscillators in A, to extract the quadrature information contained in these via
phase estimation, we use |A| probe oscillators. For our protocol, we send the |A| probes
coherently to B, an alternate but ultimately equivalent version of the protocol involves
projectively measuring the probe oscillators and sending that measurement information in
classical form to B. Now, subsystem B, say it is composed of |B| oscillators, is our energy
extraction target. Using the |B| probes, we couple them via a linear (Gaussian) interaction
to the target sites. We show that this interaction, if tuned correctly, can extract signiﬁcant
amounts of energy from B. We assume that the whole protocol is performed on a time
scale much shorter than the timescale for perturbations to propagate within the system,
hence the energy was eﬀectively “teleported”.
As the entire protocol involves Gaussian states and Gaussian interactions, we can cal-
culate all relevant quantities using the Gaussian state formalism.
First, let us outline the protocol using Dirac notation. We consider a subset7 A of the
lattice L on which Alice would like to perform phase estimation. To do so, she has in her
possession a set of |A| harmonic oscillators which will serve as probe systems.
The initial state of the lattice (whose Hilbert space we will label L) and collection of
probe systems (labelled C) are
|Ψ0⟩LC ≡|0⟩L |⃗ξ⟩C = |0⟩L ⊗|ξ⟩⊗|A|
(4.34)
7Note when we will sometimes refer to a subsystem or its corresponding set of indicies equivalently, the
diﬀerence should be clear from context.
42

notice there are as many control probes as there are sites in A, i.e. |C| = |A|. To begin the
protocol, Alice couples a probe harmonic oscillator to each target oscillator in subsystem
A. The interaction Hamiltonian is of the form δ(t)HA where
HA ≡
X
j∈A
λjφj ⊗Pj
(4.35)
note that for quadratures of oscillators in the lattice, we denote them φj, πj, while quadra-
tures of the control system oscillators are denoted Xj, Pj.
This is simply for ease of
notation and not to have to label which Hilbert space factor each operator acts on. For
example, φjPk ≡(φj)L ⊗(Pk)C, we drop the tensor product for convenience.
Now, the time evolution operator associated with Alice’s interaction is
UA = T exp


Z
R
dt δ(t)HA

= exp(−iHA) = exp

−i P

.
(4.36)
Now, after this interaction, the probe system and the lattice are in an entangled post-
measurement state which we denote
|Ψ1⟩LC ≡UA |Ψ0⟩LC ,
(4.37)
and then we can deﬁne associated density operator Ψ1 ≡|Ψ1⟩⟨Ψ1|LC, then we have
S(C)Ψ1 = S(L)Ψ1 = 1
2I(C; L)
(4.38)
Since the probes were initially in a pure state and the entangling operation was a unitary,
this means that the mutual information between the probes and the lattice is twice the
probe-lattice entanglement entropy. In our numerical results subsection 4.3.4 we show the
result of calculating this entanglement entropy.
Note that at this point, Alice could measure her oscillators’ X quadratures, and relay
the information to Bob as a classical message. As was the case for our analysis of minimal
QET, the projective measurement of the probe system is not necessary for the success of
the protocol, and keeping the protocol coherent is equivalent (energetically). For simplicity,
we will consider the coherent protocol case.
43

Bob’s action
Now, after this interaction, Alice sends her probes to Bob. We assume that the time be-
tween Alice and Bob’s interaction is negligible compared to the timescale it would take
for perturbations to propagate through the system, hence we model this as instantaneous
sequence of interactions. This is feasible for condensed matter systems, as the signal be-
tween agents interacting with diﬀerent parts of the system can travel much faster than the
speed of perturbations in the system.
Bob has a set of target sites B, from which he wishes to extract energy.
As the
quadrature information in each oscillator he received from Alice is correlated with each
oscillator’s quadrature in his target set, he needs to use the combined information from all
the probes to best predict the quadratures of the oscillators in his target sites. In other
words, to exploit all of the correlations ⟨φjφk⟩for all j ∈A and k ∈B, Bob has has to
couple each control oscillator to each target. Hence, Bob’s interaction Hamiltonian is of
the form δ(t −ϵ)HB where
HB ≡
X
j∈A, m∈B
θmjπmXj,
(4.39)
where θmj are coupling constants. The associated time evolution unitary is

where 1 ≫ϵ > 0 is there simply as a reminder that we assume this interaction takes place
right after Alice’s interaction. One may consider this nonlocal coupling between multiple
oscillators to be unphysical, but note that Bob could alternatively apply his unitary as a
sequence of two-oscillator interactions,

(4.41)
Let us label the global state after Bob’s interaction as |Ψ2⟩:
|Ψ2⟩≡UB |Ψ1⟩= UBUA |Ψ0⟩
(4.42)
We can now proceed to computing the energy cost of Alice’s action and the energetic
proﬁt of Bob’s action. We do so in subsection 4.3.3.
44

4.3.3
Energy Calculations
Some reminders before we begin the calcualtions. A, B, and L are the set of indicies for
the harmonic oscillators in subsystem A, B, and the whole lattice, respectively.
Alice’s interaction Hamiltonian and unitary is given by:
HA ≡
X
j∈A
λjφjPj,
UA ≡e−iHA.
(4.43)
While Bob’s action has a Hamiltonian and unitary given by
HB ≡
X
j∈A, m∈B
θmjπmXj,
UB ≡e−iHB.
(4.44)
For now, we keep our Hamilonian somewhat general:
H = 1

A useful identity for these calcualtions will be there Hadamard lemma:
eXY e−X = Y + [X, Y ] + 1
2![X, [X, Y ]] + ...
(4.46)
with the next orders vanishing in the case of our calculations.
Now, the state after Alice’s interaction is |Ψ1⟩= UA |Ψ0⟩, hence the change in energy
in the chain due to her measurement is
EA ≡⟨Ψ1| H |Ψ1⟩−⟨Ψ0| H |Ψ0⟩= ⟨Ψ0| (U †
AHUA −H) |Ψ0⟩
(4.47)

(4.50)
We see that the energy input by Alice is given by the variance in the probe’s quadrature
which couples to the chain, in this case P. As we use a sharper and sharper squeezed state
for the phase estimation then we will have more energy injected. Notice that the energy
injection is also quadratic in the coupling constant.
Now, we can similarly compute the energy change in the chain due to Bob’s action.

(4.56)
U †
AXkXlUA = XKXl + 1
2(λkφkXl + λlφlXk) + λkλlφkφl.
(4.57)
Now, taking an expectation value with respect to |Ψ0⟩(notation ⟨·⟩0 ≡⟨Ψ0| · |Ψ0⟩) and
ommitting terms with XjΦk since they give a product of vanishing ﬁrst moments of the

We would like for ∆E < 0, meaning that the lattice will have lost energy, and hence
via energy conservation Bob would have gained energy; extracted work via his action. To
make sure we do get negative energy, we can optimize the couplings (θ) for Bob. We ﬁnd
the optimum in the next subsubsection.
We see that the change in energy in the lattice due to Bob’s operation depends on the
φ-φ correlations of the chain. This was the intent from the outset when designing this
protocol; to harness these speciﬁc correlations as they are the strongest for our choice of
chain (even IR divergence in the critical coupling limit).
Note that the ﬁrst term is the term of interest for QET, while the other terms can be
considered as “switching costs”. Indeed, the ﬁrst term depends on the correlations between
A and the rest of the lattice (including B and its neighborhood), while the last term is
simply dependent on the self-correlation within A, averaged with respect to the couplings.
Note that we loaded up “raw” quadrature information about the φ’s into the probes
and then coupled them to the target. Naturally, the signal we pick up has some variance,
as we couple the probes to the target B, that variance displaces the φ quadratures in B
and aﬀects the energy expectation value in that region and whichever sites are coupled
to it.
Some of the variance in the quadrature information from A is useful to predict
47

the quadrature values in B or its neighborhood, we can consider this information to be
our “signal”, and this signal is manifested in the ﬁrst term, whose negativity can give
us energy extraction.
On the other hand, the last term can be considered as “noise”;
information about A that is strictly about A (self-correlation), hence counter-productive
for our prediction of the quadratures in and near B. Note that the term with the probes’
initial variance of the X quadrature can also be considered as noise, luckily in the limit of
inﬁnite squeezing8 this term vanishes: ⟨XiXj⟩0 = 1
2e−2rδij →0.
Thus, the key to quantum energy teleportation is to be able to ﬁlter the signal from
the noise; to appropriately use the information about A to predict the conﬁguration in B
and its neighborhood, and to use this information optimally. Bob has a choice of couplings
θ, given the knowledge he has of the correlation structure of the state of the chain, he can
optimize this choice to maximize his energetic proﬁt.
Optimization
To ﬁnd the optimal tuning of coupling parameters for energy extraction, we would like
to ﬁnd the minimal value of the expression in (4.58), with respect to the θ matrix being
variable, while keeping the input couplings λj and initial squeezed state parameters. As
we will keep ⃗λ ﬁxed and optimize over the θ matrix. Now, recall that the change in energy
in the lattice due to Bob’s action is given by
∆E =
X
i∈L,k∈B,l∈A
θklKkiλl ⟨φlφi⟩0 + 1
2
X
i,j∈B
X
k,l∈A
θikθjlKji (⟨XkXl⟩0 + λkλl ⟨φkφl⟩0) . (4.59)
We can deﬁne the following matrices
Vkm ≡
X
j∈L
λkGkjKmj,
k ∈A, m ∈B
(4.60)
Mik ≡⟨ψ0|XiXk|ψ0⟩+ λiλkGik,
i, k ∈A,
(4.61)
where in the above we use the ground state correlation matrix we have deﬁned previously,
Gjk ≡⟨0|φjφk|0⟩.
(4.62)
8This makes sense as the variance in the X quadratures for the probe initially are like the “thickness”
of our squeezed state needle, and having a sharper needle means less noise, hence less energy cost due to
noise.
48

Note that, in the speciﬁc example we considered with the uniform choice of initial
squeezing r and couplings (λj = λ∀j ∈A) for the probes, we get
Vjm = λ
X
j∈L
GkjKmj,
Mik = 1
2e−2rδik + λ2Gik,
i, k ∈A, m ∈B
(4.63)
and in the limit of inﬁnite squeezing, r →∞, the M matrix is simply proportional to the
correlator restricted to A, M = λ2G|A.
Now, using these newly deﬁned matrices, we can write the change in energy as
∆E = trB(θV ) + 1
2trB(KθMθT).
(4.64)
Note that K and M are symmetric. We will assume that M is invertible. Now, we can
“complete the square”, as we essentially have a second order polynomial for the θ matrix,
∆E = 1
2trB(KθMθT) + trB(θV )
= 1
2trB(KθMθT) + 1
2trB(θV K−1K) + 1
2trB(KK−1θTV T)
= 1
2trB(K(θMθT + θV K−1 + K−1V TθT))
= 1
2trB[K(θ + K−1V TM −1)M(θT + M −1V K−1)] −1
2trB[
KK−1V TM −1V K−1]
(4.65)
and we see that the ﬁrst trace term has a root, while the second term has no θ dependency.
The solution to make the ﬁrst term vanish is:
θ = −K−1V TM −1 ≡θopt.
(4.66)
As one can check, given K and M positive deﬁnite, then this choice of θ gives us a
minimum for the energy change (reaches its most negative value), which is given by
∆Eopt = −1
2trB[V TM −1V K−1] = −1
2trB[W −1V TM −1V W −1]
(4.67)
where, recall, W ≡
√
K. Thus, with this optimal choice of coupling parameters for Bob,
he can extract energy from what is locally the ground state of the chain in his region.
Now, notice that we dropped indices going from (4.60), (4.61), and (4.63), to (4.64) and
onwards. This was for simplicity, but as certain matrices (Such as G and K) are deﬁned on
the whole lattice and in certain cases we are only considering a subset of matrix elements
(e.g. indices in A or B) and we are taking inverses/transposes, it is important for us to
specify which sub-matrix we are working with in each case.
49

To avoid ambiguity, we can rewrite our results while denoting over which index set for
the rows/columns we are considering each matrix (using subscripts9). For example, letting
Λ be the diagonal matrix with the λj’s on its diagonal,
VAB = ΛAAGALKLB
(4.68)
MAA = 1
2e−2rIAA + ΛAAGAAΛAA
(4.69)
and the energy is then
∆E = trB(θBAVAB) + 1
2trB(KBBθBAMAAθT
AB)
(4.70)
the optimal choice of θ is then
θBA = −K−1
BBV T
BAM −1
AA
(4.71)
and the optimal change in energy is then
∆E = −1
2trB[V T
BAM −1
AAVABK−1
BB],
(4.72)
and so M −1 and K−1 are only the inverses of the submatrices for indices restricted to A
and B respectively.
Now, suppose we take the limit r →∞, and we insert our expressions for V and M,
then the optimal θ is given by
θBA = −K−1
BBKT
BLGT
LAG−1
AAΛ−1
AA
(4.73)
which we see is inversely dependent on Λ. Now, the optimal energy,
∆E|r→∞= −1
2trB[K−1
BBKT
BLGT
LAG−1
AAGALKLB],
(4.74)
is independent of Λ, and is strictly dependent on the correlation function and the Hamilto-
nian coupling. If we want to know how fast we will converge to this energy as r increases,
note that we can Taylor expand M −1 for large r,
M −1 ≈Λ−1G−1Λ−1 −1
2e−2rΛ−1G−1Λ−2G−1Λ−1 + O(e−4r)
(4.75)
and we can add a correction term to
∆E ≈∆E|r→∞+ 1
4e−2rtrB[K−1
BBKT
BLGT
LAG−1
AAΛ−2
AAG−1
AAGALKLB]
= ∆E|r→∞+ O(λ−2e−2r)
(4.76)
9For example, the matrix elements of KBL are Kij such that i ∈B, j ∈L.
50

and we see that either a stronger coupling for Alice or a stronger squeezing gives us more
energy (as we want the correction term to shrink).
Remember, the correlation function over the whole lattice was the inverse square root
of the Hamiltonian (where the inverse is taken over the set of indices for the whole lattice),
GLL = 1
2(KLL)−1/2
(4.77)
hence the optimal energy in the limit of inﬁnite squeezing of the probes ∆E|r→∞only
depends on the Hamiltonian coupling matrix K. Note that in the case of Hotta’s periodic
linear harmonic 1D chain, for which we will do numerical calculations, the coupling matrix
is
Kjk = 1
2δjk −α
4 (δj(k+1) + δj(k−1)),
j, k ∈ZN.

Numerical Results
Note: these plots were generated in collaboration with Jason Pye.
In this section we present various results from numerical results for a 1-D linear har-
monic chain, as described in this chapter. Comments are provided in the captions of the
plots.
In the following plots we keep the chain length and the subsets A and B ﬁxed, unless
otherwise speciﬁed. The chain length is of 20 oscillators, the oscillators for A have indices
[1, 2], while the oscillators in B have indices [11, 12]. Furthermore, we set the coupling
strength for Alice’s intreractions to λj = λ = 1 ∀j ∈A. For all the plots of teleported
energy we use Bob’s optimal coupling constants which we have derived above. The values
of the squeezing parameter r and the coupling constant α can vary from plot to plot, we
specify them for each plot.

because of the IR divergence of the φ-φ correlator, which are the correlations we exploit
for our QET protocol. In (b) we can see a power law decay of the mutual information with
the distance between A and B.

totically. We will show this is the case in our QET protocol for quantum ﬁeld theory (see
(5.80)). Since we also sweep over negative values of r, we see that having a greater variance
of the X qudarature for the probe is counter-productive to the gathering of information.

(a) We see how the squeezing parameter aﬀects entanglement breaking, in the limit of
r →−∞, the probe is in a near-P eigenstate hence Alice’s interaction becomes a local
unitary on A, hence no entanglement is broken. On the other hand, in the limit r →∞, we
see that there is an asymptotic plateau; i.e. when all of the pre-existing A- ¯A entanglement
is broken. (b) Varying the coupling parameter of the chain, keeping the squeezing high, we
see that a strongly coupled chain can get more entanglement broken; this makes sense as
the entanglement entropy of the subregion A will be higher as we have stronger coupling
and we approach criticality (α = 1).

We see that the information about B that is gained through measurement of A reaches
a plateau fairly quickly. This could be interpreted as having gained all the information
there is to know about B from the knowledge of the φ quadrature in A. Thus we see that
after a certain level of squeezing there is not much more useful information gained from
increasing the squeezing, hence there are diminishing return on the information gain vs.
energetic cost past a few orders of squeezing.

We see that Bob’s energy extraction actually
increases the entropy of the target region, namely by increasing the entanglement of the
target region with the rest of the lattice. We can see that, with the parameters optimized,
the energy extraction is eﬀectively linked to increasing the entanglement of the target region
with the rest of the lattice. We discuss the implications of this further in our discussion
section in this chapter.

Other Comments
4.4.1
Equivalent Gaussian Operations
If one is interested in QET strictly for its capacity to create negative energy density (relative
to ground state) regions, instead of using a probe system as a “liaison” for information,
one could potentially couple directly subsystems A and B and perform the unitary e−iHAB
where HAB is the following
HAB =
X
j∈A,m∈B
λjθmjφjπm.
(4.79)
By the nature of our constructed protocol, when looking at the energy near the region B
(i.e. excluding the energy in A), the energy density should be the same as in the case
where our usual QET protocol with probes (in the limit of inﬁnite squeezing). This is
because the only role of the probes is to carry the φ quadrature information from A to B,
then displace the φ quadratures in region B by an amount linearly related to the measured
quadratures from A. The direct coupling unitary achieves the same eﬀect, although the
energy injection at A will be diﬀerent (the variance in φ in B will cause displacements of
π in A). As in the case of the other unitaries in this protocol, we can decompose it into a
prodcut of unitaries,
e−iHAB =
Y
j∈A,m∈B
e−iλjθmjφjπm,
(4.80)
hence this would be implementable via a sequence of pulses.
The fact that the above
interactions can create states of locally negative energy densities should not come as a
surprise as it is simply a Gaussian unitary which transforms the ground state into a cer-
tain squeezed state, and squeezed states are known to admit cases with negative energy
densities10. It would be interesting to see which general squeezing (or any other Gaussian
operation) would maximize the negative energy density.

Digression: On Emergent Geometry and QET
In this subsection we discuss how some of the results presented in this chapter could be
interpreted in the context of some recently developed theories of emergent spacetime.
10In quantum ﬁeld theory in curved spacetime, squeezed states can appear as the ground state of a
curved background as seen from the viewpoint of a non-freely-falling observer. There are known cases (e.g.
Rindler/Boulware vacua) where such squeezed states admit negative energy density regions. [10]

Space from Hilbert Space
There has been some recent work attempting to build spacetime from quantum mechanics,
in the aim of advancing us towards a full theory of quantum gravity. One such papers on
emergent spacetime has been is the one by Cao, Carroll and Michalakis [13] (CCM). In
this paper they construct a spacetime geometry from a discrete set of ﬁnite-dimensional
Hilbert spaces, the mutual information between degrees of freedom deﬁnining the graph’s
edges and the eﬀective distance between nodes (nodes sharing more mutual infomration are
closer). As the inspiration for this work came from the ER=EPR conjecture [65], a result
from quantum ﬁeld theory in curved spacetime/quantum gravity, they deﬁne connectivity
of spacetime from entanglement of the ﬁeld. The original argument for this conjecture
came from the entanglement of the ground state of eternal black holes, and subsequently
was generalized to ground states of quantum ﬁeld theories. Although we will not delve
further into these theories of emergent gravity, we will highlight some possible connections
that could be made with this work.
Metric from Couplings
Looking at the work of CCM [13], they deﬁne the distance between nodes in terms of
mutual information. The intuition is that degrees of freedom that are physically closer
should be more entangled/correlated. Instead of considering ﬁnite-dimensional systems,
suppose we try to apply this intuition to our continuous-variable systems. The coupling
matrix between lattice sites, K gives, in some sense, a geometry to our lattice. Indeed for
objects that are uncoupled, the matrix elements are null, and in physical implementations
this would usually mean that the lattice sites are disconnected. The coupling strength
matters too, if we consider the lattice to be a discrete approximation to a quantum ﬁeld
theory, then the couplings between lattice sites is supposed to be a nearest-neighbor type
coupling which comes from a ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation to the derivative; ∂xφ(x) ≈
(∆x)−1(φ(xi) −φ(xj)). Since the Hamiltonian for a massless scalar quantum ﬁeld theory
in curved spacetime [48] is given by
H(Φ, Π) =
Z
R3d3x

Π∂0Φ −1
2
p
|g|gµν(∂µΦ)(∂νΦ)

(4.81)
where Π =
p
|g| (g00∂0Φ + g0i∂iΦ). Thus we see that, if we expand all the spatial deriva-
tives into ﬁnite diﬀerences, that the metric determinant and metric components is akin to
the K coupling matrix. Since the metric multiplies the inverse length, i.e. we roughly have
59

terms proportional to ∼
p
|g|gµν(∆x)−1, then changing the components of the metric or
even the scale can change the eﬀective ﬁnite diﬀerence coupling. It is known that one can
read oﬀthe components of a metric from the coupling, or equivalently the correlations of
the ground state [61]. My point is that one could potentially go the other way around,
say, in the context of simulating emergent spacetime with some analog quantum degrees
of freedom.
Negative energy densities
Now that we have argued that ground states of harmonic oscillator lattices provide a decent
model to study emergent geometries, we can now discuss how our QET results can be
interpreted in this picture. In the CCM paper [14], for their emergent geometry they have
deﬁned, the ground state mutual information between sites deﬁnes a certain geometry, and
perturbations about the ground state can be regarded as curvature perturbations. They
derive a relation between what they deﬁne as scalar (Ricci) curvature of a given region and
variations of entanglement entropy from that of the ground states’;
RA = −CδSA
(4.82)
where C > 0 is some constant which depends on the size of the region and the number of
spatial dimensions we consider.
Thus, increases in entropy of a certain region increase the scalar curvature of that
region, which, if we look at perturbations of Einstein’s equations [37], then means we
have a postive energy perturbation δ ⟨T00⟩> 0. As it turns out, our model of emergent
spacetime from a lattice of harmonic oscillators corroborates this prediction that energy
and entanglement entropy variations are anti-correlated.
Indeed, we inject energy as Alice entangles a subsystem of the lattice with probes and
breaks the intra-lattice entanglement. In ﬁgure 4.4 we plotted this entanglement breaking
due to measurement and we see that for larger r we get more entanglement breaking,
while we also get greater energy injection (ﬁg. 4.3). Thus our result seems to corroborate
the intuition we can get from studying emergent spacetime; breaking entanglement and
entangling ancillary systems with the ground state seems to be associated with an increase
in energy, and if emergent geometry theories are right, an increase in scalar curvature.
Conversely, in the energy extraction process, Bob creates a negative energy density
region via his action, as depicted in ﬁgure 4.6. Cao et al. [14] mention that they expect
to have negative induced curvature in the case of positive variations of the entropy from
60

the ground state. Now, negative curvature does not usually appear in typical sub-galactic
scale general relativity, but in the case of dark energy there are theories that allow for a
repulsive gravitational force equivalent to negative dark energy density. Thus, although
negative energy densities do not conventionally have a general relativistic interpretation, we
can consider them as a sign of negative energy density. Thus, from the emergent spacetime
theory, we would expect that we must increase the entanglement of the target region in
order to extract energy. This is exactly what we can see from our calculations, we ﬁnd
that the variation in entropy is positive, and that it is due to an increase of entanglement
of B with its complement, as depicted in ﬁgure 4.8.
To summarize, our ﬁndings indicate that the measurement process for QET breaks
vacuum entanglement and injects energy, while the extraction of energy reinforces the en-
tanglement entropy of the targeted region. In the emergent spacetime picture of Cao et
al. [14], we ﬁnd that positive and negative energy densities thus result in locally positively
and negatively curved geometries, respectively. Our quantum energy teleportation anal-
ysis in this chapter thus provided a quantitative testbed for this new theory of emergent
spacetime.

Chapter 5
Probing Quantum Fields
5.1
Introduction/Overview
A great portion of relativistic quantum information is devoted to understanding the infor-
mation theoretic properties of quantum ﬁelds and exploring how one can exploit some of
these properties to accomplish certain information theoretic tasks. Examples of such tasks
include the harvesting of entanglement [56], hiding private information [12], and probing
the curvature of spacetime [45].
As the fundamental quantum theory of nature, breakthroughs in understanding quan-
tum ﬁeld theory can further our knowledge in multiple connected ﬁelds, such as is the
case with the recent surge of advances in quantum gravity and holography, sparked by the
study of entanglement in quantum ﬁeld theories [42, 37]. One of the diﬀerence between the
approaches of the quantum gravity community and that of relativistic quantum informa-
tion theorists is the set of tools used to probe the structure of quantum ﬁeld theories. The
quantum gravity approach uses geometry, holography (e.g. Ryu-Takayanagi in AdS/CFT
[52]), and quantum error correction [54] to understand the information theoretic structure
while the relativistic quantum information community uses ﬁrst-quantized systems, e.g.
Unruh-DeWitt detectors, two-level spins, as “windows” into the underlying structure of
the ﬁeld. Both approaches study subsystems of quantum ﬁelds and their quantum corre-
lations, despite using diﬀerent tools to do so. One of the goals of this thesis is to provide
a bridge between these formalisms.
62

In this chapter, we study certain types of “windows” into the structure of quantum
ﬁelds. Just as is typical in relativistic quantum information, as the full Hilbert space of a
quantum ﬁeld can be too large to wield, we restrict our study to subsystems of the ﬁeld.
To peer into these subsystems, a ﬁrst-quantized system, such as an spin or a harmonic
oscillator, is coupled to the ﬁeld via an interaction that is localized both spatially and
temporally. The point of employing a ﬁrst-quantized system is that one can apply onto it
the mathematical tools from the quantum information theory of discrete and continuous
variable systems. By studying these ﬁrst-quantized “probe” systems which are coupled
to a quantum ﬁeld, it is intended for the information theoretic structure of the ﬁeld to
transfer over to the probe. In some sense, the probe is simply a “broker” of information
from the quantum ﬁeld.
For one whose interest lies in the theory of quantum ﬁelds, the goal is to factor out the
intricacies of the probing mechanism itself, in order to have an unobstructed view into the
structure of the ﬁeld. On the other end, the idealizations required for such clarity can cause
a loss of physical implementability, which is of importance to those looking into potentially
realizing a certain protocol in real experiments.
Our approach in this chapter will be
somewhere in the middle ground between theoretical idealization and implementability.
More speciﬁcally, we will consider temporarily instantaneous, spatially smeared interactions
between various ﬁrst-quantized probe systems and a quantum ﬁeld, and consider a range
of probe systems, ranging from harmonic oscillators to spins and qubits.
In this chapter, we will explore how to tune probe-ﬁeld interactions in order to opti-
mally “percolate” information about a quantum ﬁeld onto a set of ﬁrst-quantized probe
systems. We will see how, depending on whether one wants to gather classical or quantum
information from the ﬁeld, one can tune the probe-ﬁeld interactions and processing of in-
formation accordingly. In our protocols, gaining classical information about the ﬁeld will
amount to estimating (approximating a projective measurement) the eigenvalue of a cer-
tain ﬁeld localized observable, while gaining quantum information will come from swapping
the quantum state of the probe with the state on a subspace of the ﬁeld.
In terms of which ﬁrst-quantized probe systems we will be exploring, we will investigate
how to load the ﬁeld’s information onto either a harmonic oscillator, a multi-level spin, a
qubit (two-level spin) or a qudit. We will also explore how to parallelize this information
gathering using an array of ﬁrst-quantized systems in order to emulate the Hilbert-space
of the ﬁeld’s second-quantized system and gather more information.
All the work in this chapter is original unless cited otherwise, this work was performed
63

Theory of Field Subsystems
We are interested in coupling probe systems to a ﬁeld via some localized interaction in
order for the probe system to harvest some information about the ﬁeld. Before we ven-
ture oﬀinto the description of various protocols for diﬀerent tasks, we must describe what
exactly is the information about the ﬁeld we are targeting. Once that we have outlined
what exactly is our target information, we can then consider diﬀerent types of probes and
reason which one would be theoretically optimal and which one could be near-optimal but
more viable for implementation.
Thus, this section will be dedicated to laying the mathematical underpinning describ-
ing the class of subsystems of quantum ﬁelds that we will be encountering in our later
calculations.
Essentially, the quantum ﬁeld’s Hilbert space can be decomposed into the Hilbert space
of many harmonic oscillators, the quadrature observables of these oscillators being smeared
ﬁeld observables. Now, either classical information (e.g. the eigenvalue of one of the ﬁeld’s
local quadratures) can be copied onto the probe, or quantum information can be swapped
(as it cannot be copied; no-cloning in quantum mechanics) onto the probe.
Using a harmonic oscillator as a probe, the information about a single quadrature of
the local ﬁeld subspace can be copied onto the probe via a continuous-variable phase esti-
mation. In a later section we analyze the tradeoﬀs between information gain and energetic
cost for such a measurement.
In the entanglement harvesting section, we will study how to swap the state on this
subspace with the state of the probe. If we swap the states from two diﬀerent subspaces
in two diﬀerent regions, then for a state of the ﬁeld which was entangled between these
subspaces, the probes will have inherited this entanglement.

5.2.1
Quick Setup
Before we begin, let us setup our notation for Quantum Field Theory. We will be looking
mainly at massless Klein-Gordon Fields in 1+1 dimensions, i.e. a ﬁeld Φ(x, t) such that
2Φ(x, t) = 0,
(5.1)
in the canonical quantization. The canonical conjugate momentum is denoted Π(x, t) and
it obeys the usual commutation relation with the ﬁeld,
[Φ(x), Πy] = iδ(x −y).
(5.2)
The Hamiltonian of the ﬁeld is given by
HF = 1

Z
R
dx

Π2(x) + (∂xΦ(x))2
.
(5.3)
5.2.2
Maximal Commuting Sets of Field Observables
As we saw in the previous chapter, the Hilbert space of a quantum ﬁeld can be decomposed
into a tensor product of the harmonic oscillator subspace1 for each frequency, each har-
monic oscillator being decomposable into the direct sum of Fock states of diﬀerent particle
numbers.
We can also characterize the ﬁeld in the functional picture using a complete set of
commuting observables, usually chosen to be {Φ(x)}∀x, hence, as these are commuting, we
can, roughly speaking2, consider the ﬁeld’s Hilbert space to factorize into a tensor product
of the eigenspaces of the ﬁeld operators at each point, i.e. if the eigenspace of Φ(x) is Hx,
then the total Hilbert space of the quantum ﬁeld can be interpreted as
HF =
O
x
Hx,
(5.4)
Colloquially, it is often said that quantum ﬁeld theory is like “having a harmonic oscilator
at every point”. The maximal set of commuting observables we can choose are, for exam-
ple, either the set of ﬁeld observables at every point, {Φ(x)}∀x or their respective canonical
1We will use the term subspace and subsystem very loosely, in general there is a diﬀerence between
subspaces (direct sum components) and subsystems (tensor product factor) [7]
2See Tsirelson’s problem [63] and Connes embedding conjecture for subtleties regarding the fact that
commuting observables do not necessarily imply a tensor product factorisation.
65

conjugate operators {Π(x)}∀x.
Notice that at every point there exists a subalgebra of operators, i.e. any operator that
is a function of Φ(x) and Π(x) is part of a subalgebra of local (single-point) operators. The
canonical commutation relation also tells us that [Φ(x), Π(x′)] = iδ(x−x′), i.e. only the two
canonically conjugate operators part of the same single-point subalgebra do not commute.
The joint eigenstates of all the ﬁeld amplitude operators are the ﬁeld conﬁguration states,
i.e.
|φ⟩∈HF :
Φ(x) |φ⟩= φ(x) |φ⟩
∀x.
(5.5)
These states are akin to having a “position eigenvector” for each harmonic oscillator at
every point. In general, any state in the Hilbert space of the ﬁeld can be decomposed in
the basis of these conﬁguration states
|Ψ⟩=
Z
φ∈L2(R)
Dφ ⟨φ|Ψ⟩|φ⟩
(5.6)
as these states form a complete basis for HF. Note that we denote the functional integration
measure as Dφ.
Note that, if we were to construct a maximal set of commuting observables which were
each strictly functions of the ﬁeld amplitudes, e.g. OA = f(Φ), then these would also have
the |φ⟩states as eigenstates.
5.2.3
Smeared Observables
In our calculations we will be interested in smeared ﬁeld observables, such as
Φλ ≡
Z
R
dxλ(x)Φ(x),
(5.7)
where λ is a compactly supported real-valued function. Notice that the ﬁeld conﬁguration
eigenstates are also eigenstates of this operator
Φλ |φ⟩=
Z
R
dxλ(x)φ(x) |φ⟩= (λ, φ) |φ⟩
(5.8)
where we introduce the following notation for the L2(R) inner product:
(f, g) ≡⟨f, g⟩L2 ≡
Z
R
dxf(x)g∗(x).
(5.9)
66

So, for a given ﬁeld conﬁguration, the eigenvalue of the smeared ﬁeld operator is the L2(R)
inner product between the conﬁguration and the smearing.
We can deﬁne the canonically conjugate variable for this smeared ﬁeld operator, it will
be a smeared momentum operator
Πλ ≡
1
∥λ∥2
Z
R
dxλ(x)Π(x),
(5.10)
where the norm in the above is the usual L2(R) norm, ∥λ∥≡∥λ∥2 =
p
(λ, λ). As one
can check, because of our normalization of the canonical conjugate, these two smeared
operators obey the commutation relations of a single quantum harmonic oscillator
[Φλ, Πλ] =
1
∥λ∥2
Z

dx λ(x)

=

∥λ∥2
Z
R
dx |λ(x)|2
|
{z

∥λ∥2

(5.11)
These new operators we have deﬁned, {Φλ, Πλ} can thus be considered to be observables
of a “subsystem” of the quantum ﬁeld which is essentially a single harmonic oscillator
subspace. The space of polynomials made from powers of Φλ and Πλ is closed under the
commutator, we can then consider this to be a closed Lie subalgebra of operators.
5.2.4
Hilbert Space Factorization for Smeared Observables
Suppose we constructed two subalgebras with two diﬀerent smearings, λ and µ, then, for
these operators to commute we would need
[Φµ, Πλ] =
i
∥λ∥2
Z
R
dx µ(x)λ(x)
|
{z
}
(µ,λ)
= i(µ, λ)
∥λ∥2
!= 0 ⇐⇒(µ, λ) = 0,
(5.12)
i.e. the smearings need to be orthogonal with respect to the L2 inner product. An easy way
to achieve this is to require the smearings to have disjoint support, i.e. supp(λ)∩supp(µ) =
∅=⇒(λ, µ) = 0.
This will be our approach in this thesis; we will assume the spatial smearings of the
detectors are disjoint. We could, alternatively, consider spatially non-disjoint smearings,
as long as they are L2-orthogonal, then the operators will commute. Note that we could
construct a complete set of observables from a set of smearing functions which form an
67

orthogonal basis for L2(R). For convenience, let us assume that we restrict ourselves to
a compact region of space, say R ⊂R (i.e.
that we have IR cutoﬀ) in order to have
a countable basis for L2(R).
Now, let B ≡{fj ∈L2(R), j ∈N|(fj, fk) = δjk} and
span(B) = L2(R).
Then, the set of smeared observables {Φλ}λ∈B forms a maximally
commuting set of observables. The Hilbert space factors into tensor products for each
functional basis element
HF =
O
λ∈B
Hλ
(5.13)
where Hλ is deﬁned as the eigenspace of Φλ. An example of a set of bases for L2(R) made
up of compactly supported orthonormal functions is the set of so-called orthonormal com-
pactly supported wavelet bases [17].
In this thesis, we will encounter calculations involving a ﬁnite set of smeared sub-
spaces of the ﬁeld for which the smearings are disjointly supported e.g., L ≡{λk, k ∈
1, ..., N|supp(λj) ̸= supp(λk)} hence orthogonal (λj, λk) = 0. As these N functions are
technically orthogonal, there necessarily exists a set of functions ¯L such that L ∪¯L forms
an orthogonal basis for L2(R). Of course this completion of the basis is non-unique, one
has options in their choice of basis for span( ¯L), but it is good to know that for any given
set of orthogonal functions L, such an extension exists. This extension tells us what would
be the Hilbert space decomposition for which the space of each λj is a tensor factor, or in
other words, given a set of smeared observables, what additional set of smeared observables
gives a maximal commuting set of observables.
A common example of smeared observables that is often used in the literature is the
(inverse) Fourier transform smearing, and the associated subspaces is called the “modes”
Φk ≡
1
√
2π
Z
R
dxe−ikxΦ(x)
Πk ≡
1
√
2π
Z
R
dxe−ikxΠ(x).
(5.14)
This Fourier transform is in some sense a complex-valued smearing, and the Fourier plane
waves form a basis for L2(R). Notice this Fourier smearing is non-local; the basis of func-
tions (plane waves) is non-compactly supported. One issue with this speciﬁc smearing is
the fact that that Φk and Πk are not self-adjoint, hence they are not technically observ-
ables, but one can consider the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian components of each mode
to be observables, e.g. (Φk + Φ†
k)/2 is an observable.

5.2.5
Energetics & Local/Nonlocal Factorization Duality
This subsection holds the key concepts to this thesis. Here we describe how the structure
of the Hamiltonian is what holds the key to both entanglement harvesting and quantum
energy teleportation. Read below for further explanation.
Hamiltonian of Smeared Observables
In the pointwise Hilbert space factorization “representation”, we usually write out the
Hamiltonian as
HF = 1
2
Z
R
dx

Π2(x) + (∂xΦ(x))2
.
(5.15)
Now, let B be an orthogonal functional basis for L2(R) made of compactly supported
(smearing) functions. We can express the ﬁeld and its canonical conjugate momentum at
a given point as
Φ(x) =
X
λ∈B
Φλ
λ(x)
∥λ∥2,
Π(x) =
X
λ∈B
Πλ λ(x),
(5.16)
where as before Φλ =
R
dx λ(x)Φ(x), Πλ = ∥λ∥−2 R
dx λ(x)Π(x) are operator-valued func-
tionals. Note the above sum ranges over the basis functions B, which is our chosen orthog-
onal basis for L2(R). As in general this basis is not necessarily countable, the sum is to be
understood as an integral with an appropriate measure.
Now, we can express the Hamiltonian in terms of the smearing decomposition by plug-
ging in our expressions for Φ(x) and Π(x) into the point-wise Hamiltonian,
HF = 1

(5.17)
where f ′(x) and g′(x) are Lagrange notation for diﬀerentiation, and δ[f −g] was meant as
a “functional delta measure”, which appeared from the orthogonality of our basis. We see
that, similarly to the pointwise case, the momenta are uncoupled whereas the amplitude
69

quadratures are coupled. As we chose our basis to consist of compactly supported orthog-
onal functions, the inner product (f ′, g′) ̸= 0 ⇐⇒supp(f) ∩supp(g) ̸= ∅. This means
that a given harmonic oscillator associated to a given smearing is coupled to all the other
oscillators whose smearings’ support are overlapping.
Thus, for our real-valued compactly supported orthogonal smearings, the Hamiltonian
is still coupled between Harmonic oscillators. This means that even in our smeared ob-
servables picture, there is a sense of “locality”; only subspaces whose associated smearings
are close (in support) to a given smearing are coupling to it. Also, importantly, note that
the coupling is still quadratic (no terms with more than two oscillators coupled at a time).
This means that any ground state or thermal state of this Hamiltonian will necessarily be
a Gaussian state in our smeared observables factorization “representation” of the state.
We explore this in further detail in the next subsection.
Local vs. Nonlocal Duality
Now, as is traditional in quantum theory, to understand the dynamics of a system, one
decomposes a state of interest into superpositions of energetic eigenvectors, then time
evolution becomes simply relative phase accumulation between the energetic eigenvector
amplitudes. In quantum ﬁeld theory, not only is the global energy eigenbasis important
for dynamics, but a speciﬁc state in particular, the ground state, is central to the whole
theory, partly since it is the canvas upon which other states can be constructed.
For
free ﬁeld quantum ﬁeld theory (of interest in this thesis), the factorization of the Hilbert
space into Fourier modes decouples the harmonic oscillators in its representation of the
Hamiltonian,
HF = 1
2
Z

Π†
kΠk + k2Φ†

(5.18)
where Φk and Πk are the usual Fourier mode globally smeared operators. We see that
in this factorization of the Hilbert space, we get a set of harmonic oscillators for each
frequency that are uncoupled. Hence, energetically, each frequency’s Hilbert space tensor
factor is independent. Thus, an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, such as the ground state,
is a product state of the ground state of each frequency
|0⟩=
O
ω
|0ω⟩.
(5.19)
70

In general, instead of having a “Fourier decomposition” for the set of ﬁeld observables,
for a general Hamiltonian we have a Bogolyubov transformation which diagonalizes the
Hamiltonian in the vector space of quadratures. For ﬁnite-dimensional intuition, consider
a general Hamiltonian that is quadratic in some set of ladder operators, then
H =


(5.20)
where M is our Bogolyubov transformation and D is a diagonal matrix. Thus, in general
there exists a basis that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian, and the ground state of each mode
in that basis, e.g. in the above case |0⟩: cj |0⟩= 0, then is annihilated by elements of
the vector M
 ⃗a†T
⃗aTT, which are mixtures of creation and annihilation operators aj’s
and a†
k’s for j ̸= k. This means that this ground state is a multimode squeezed state, and
we have correlations between modes; we touched upon this concept back in our QET on a
lattice chapter (see (4.12)).
Thus, in some sense, a state that is local in the “energetic factorization” of the Hilbert
space is nonlocally correlated in any other factorization. This is what we use for Quantum
Energy Teleportation and for entanglement harvesting, the natural ground state is cor-
related with respect to the usual spatial factorization or with respect to any non-Fourier
smeared observables factorization.
Note that this concept is akin to our discussion of
skew-subspaces in Quantum Error Correction back in our Quantum Information Theory
background section 2.5.3.
Indeed, in the spatial factorization, the derivative term ∼(∂xΦ(x))2 can be seen as a
“nearest neighbor” coupling (one can consider an analogous discretization onto a lattice
and the derivative coupling then becomes a ﬁnite diﬀerence term), while in the smeared
observables factorization, we see in equation (5.17) that there is eﬀectively a coupling
between diﬀerent factors. This coupling yields a ground state which is eﬀectively multi-
mode squeezed between factors, hence entangled. We exploit this entanglement between
smeared observable subspaces for entanglement harvesting later in this chapter.
Now, as in every duality, one can use either picture to describe a certain phenomenon,
and both descriptions are equivalent, by the nature of the duality. As such, for an operation
that is local in either the spatial factorization or the smeared observable factorization, this
very same operation becomes nonlocal in Fourier space, which is the simplest picture
to understand energetics.
In the next chapter, this is what we will use for Quantum
Energy Teleportation, although we act on two spatially disjoint regions of the quantum
71

ﬁeld, in phase space the actions overlap, hence this allows for an energetic exchange. Our
method of calculation of energy exchange reﬂects this overlap, as we switch to a phase
space representation of our operations (by looking at the displacements’ action on each
frequency). We will also perform the same computation using the smeared observables
factorization combined the Gaussian state formalism.
5.2.6
Phase space & Gaussian State Representation
We can deﬁne a phase space for our basis of smeared observables, just like one usually does
for Fourier space. As our smeared observables are simply a linear transformation on the
space of observables, for a Gaussian state of the quantum ﬁeld, the state is also Gaussian
with respect to smeared observables. For example, for a Gaussian state of the ﬁeld, any
expectation value of product of operators factorizes into sums of products of two-point
functions by Wick’s theorem [55], this property gets lifted onto the smeared observables;
as two-observable expectation values are simply doubly smeared two-point functions.
For a ﬁnite set of orthogonal smearings {λj}j, consider, for notational purposes, a vector
of observables
⃗Ξ = (Φλ1, Πλ1, Φλ2, Πλ2, ...)T.
(5.21)
Now, given a generic Gaussian state of the ﬁeld with density operator ρ, we can compute
ﬁrst moments as
dj = ⟨Ξj⟩ρ = tr(ρΞj)
(5.22)
and the second moments as
σjk = 1
2 ⟨ΞjΞk + ΞkΞk⟩ρ −⟨Ξj⟩ρ ⟨Ξk⟩ρ .
(5.23)
We will use this in our calculations in this chapter.
5.2.7
Wave Functional Picture
In this thesis we will often encounter displacement operators which generate a coherent
state in the subspace of a certain smeared observable, that is, we will encounter operators
of the type
U = exp (−iαΞλ) ,
(5.24)
72

where Ξλ is a smeared subspace quadrature, e.g., Φλ or Πλ as deﬁned before. Suppose
we have some state |Ψ⟩=
R
Dϕ ⟨ϕ|Ψ⟩|ϕ⟩of the ﬁeld, it is interesting to see how such a
displacement operator will aﬀect the wavefunctional. Suppose U = eiαΦλ, then
U |Ψ⟩=
Z
Dϕ ⟨ϕ|Ψ⟩eiαΦλ |ϕ⟩=
Z
Dϕ
 eiα(λ,ϕ) ⟨ϕ|Ψ⟩

|ϕ⟩
(5.25)
and we see that the wavefunctional acquires a functionally-dependent phase, i.e. each ﬁeld
conﬁguration acquires a phase equal to its inner product with the smearing. Comparatively,
if we chose instead to exponentiate a smeared momentum operator, i.e. suppose U =
e−iα∥λ∥2Πλ, then
U |Ψ⟩=
Z
Dϕe−iα∥λ∥2Πλ ⟨ϕ|Ψ⟩|ϕ⟩=

|ϕ⟩

Dϕ ⟨ϕ −αλ|Ψ⟩|ϕ⟩=

Dϕ ⟨ϕ|Ψ⟩|ϕ + αλ⟩
(5.26)
and we see that the wavefunctional is shifted, with all the conﬁgurations shifted by a
“bump” corresponding to the coupling α times the smearing function λ.
Thus, we see that overall any displacement operator that acts on the subspace of the
smeared observables {Φλ, Πλ} only aﬀects the functional component related to the smearing
λ, i.e.
added phases only depend on the inner product of conﬁgurations with λ and
functional shifts are by multiples of λ.
5.2.8
On spatial vs. temporal smearing
In this thesis our probe-ﬁeld interactions are all smeared in space but instantaneous in time.
In this subsection we will see why such a choice can be advantageous from a mathematical
standpoint.
Detectors
Typically in relativistic quantum information the type of probe-ﬁeld interaction that is
canonical is the Unruh-DeWitt interaction [38, 10], whose most commonly used variant is
a coupling between a probe which is spatially point-like but temporally smeared. More
speciﬁcally, in the interaction picture, the interaction Hamiltonian is of the form
Hint(t) = η(t)m(t) ⊗Φ(x, t),
m(t) = eiΩσztσxe−iΩσzt
(5.27)
73

where η(t) is a temporal coupling window function, m(t) is the so-called “monopole mo-
ment” of the probe, and Ωσz is the free Hamiltonian of the probe. We see that because
of the free Hamiltonian of the probe and the non-instantaneous coupling, we must con-
jugate the interaction Hamiltonian by the time evolution operator, this makes it so that
the operator which couples to the ﬁeld changes with time.
This continuous change in
time of the probe operator can become mathematically inconvenient, as there is a need for
time-ordered exponentiation3

which has multiple terms at multiple orders which cannot be combined into a single ex-
ponential. This requires the use of perturbation theory, more speciﬁcally the interaction
Hamiltonian is made to have a small coupling constant; |η(t)| ≪1 and then we can trun-
cate the above Dyson series at ﬁrst or second order.
Instead of a temporal smearing, we use a spatial smearing of a detector.
One could alternatively consider temporarily smeared interactions between a probe and
the ﬁeld for a probe having no free Hamiltonian (or alternatively, for the free Hamiltonian
to commute with the interaction), then we would have
Hint(t) = η(t)m ⊗Φ(x, t),
m = σx
(5.29)
and in the interaction picture we would have

(5.30)
and we see that a temporal smearing for a probe with no free Hamiltonian yields couplings
to spatially smeared left and right-moving component. This makes sense as at each point
3Note that unlike regular exponentiation, there is no need for a 1/n! factor, this is because at the nth
order we are integrating an n-dimensional simplex in Rn which has volume tn/n!.
74

in spacetime that the detector couples, there is a lightcone emanating, with two lightfronts
(in 1 + 1D) carrying the left and right-moving components of the ﬁeld. We can then cut
the lightcone-propagating smearing along a spatial slice instead of a temporal one.
In our calculations in this thesis, we use spatially smeared interactions, let J be some
operator of a ﬁrst-quantized probe system (e.g. J = m as above), then we will use inter-
action Hamiltonians of the form
Hint(t) = δ(t) J ⊗Φλ = δ(t)

dx λ(x)J ⊗Φ(x),
(5.31)
which, when time-ordered exponentiated, gives

= exp(−iJ ⊗Φλ).
(5.32)
Alternatively, we will sometimes use interactions with only one of the sectors of the
ﬁeld, e.g. by replacing Φ(x) 7→Φ+(x), we couple only to the left-moving sector of the
ﬁeld. This means that our spatial smearing has a direct analogy to a temporally smeared
coupling as in (5.30).
5.3
Multipoint measurement
5.3.1
Types of Probe Systems
Why multiple types of probes?
Gaussian operations are spanned by quadratic unitaries, i.e. any exponential of a self-
adjoint second-degree polynomial of quadratures will preserve the Gaussianity of a given
state, and the transformation will have a linear representation on phase space, as we have
seen in our introduction to the Gaussian state formalism.
As we are interested in coupling harmonic oscillator probes to the ﬁeld, any interaction
between the probe and the ﬁeld that is quadratic in the quadratures of the ﬁeld subspace
and the probe will preserve the Gaussianity of both systems. For example, the interactions
we will be considering will all be generated by Hamiltonians of the form λQP ⊗RA where
QP and RA are some quadratures (e.g. X or P) of P, the probe, and A, the target subspace
75

of the ﬁeld, respectively.
Although the type of probe most compatible with a harmonic oscillator subspace is (as
is to be expected) another harmonic oscillator, we will explore how other types of ﬁnite-
dimensional probe systems can emulate a harmonic oscillator, and, in an asymptotic limit,
recover full accuracy. Put simply, a very large-dimensional qudit is nearly a harmonic
oscillator, and a set of multiple qubits can emulate an exponentially large (in the number
of qubits) qudit Hilbert space if one processes the lot of qubits coherently (this is one of
the main tenets of quantum computing).
By playing with these diﬀerent types of probes, if our goal is measurement of a quantum
ﬁeld observable, then using unitary interactions between the probe system and the ﬁeld,
followed by a projective measurement of the probe system, this oﬀers a model for a certain
POVM acting on the ﬁeld.
In this subsection, we provide a set of interactions between probe systems and the ﬁeld.
The time evolution operators associated to these interactions could be considered to be as
part of a phase estimation procedure, or as we will see later, could be considered to be
part of a swap procedure.
The purpose of this subsection is to oﬀer a “catalog” of interactions for diﬀerent probe
systems which are asymptotically equivalent. In what exact limit these become equivalent
will be treated in the text. Once we have covered this equivalence, we will focus on the
simplest case, i.e. harmonic oscillators, to construct our protocols, as most of the analysis
carries over to the equivalent cases.
The purpose of this is to cover as many possible
implementations as possible while not having to treat every case in full detail. When some
disparities could arise between the diﬀerent types of implementations, we will specify how
to adjust the protocol to a certain case.
Overview
In general, interaction Hamiltonians we will cover will be of the form
OP ⊗Φλ
(5.33)
where Φλ is as usual. This is for sampling the eigenvalue of a single smeared observable.
More generally, we can have any quadrature cos(θ)Φλ + sin(θ)Πλ instead of just Φλ.

With multiple probes, we can generalize a “single-sample” interaction to multi-point
(multi-sample) interactions. This is if we want to sample the eigenvalue of multiple smeared
observables at once. Then we would have an interaction Hamiltonian of the form
X
j
OPj ⊗Φλj
(5.34)
where the λj are functions of compact support with mutually disjoint support.
For the rest of this subsection, we will provide a “catalog” of interaction Hamiltonians
for a single sampling of smeared observable, and we will use Φλ as the place holder.
Spin-like Qudits
Eﬀectively an Unruh-DeWitt-like coupling,
J ⊗Φλ =
Z
dx λ(x)J ⊗Φ(x).
(5.35)
where J is as has been deﬁned in previous sections:
J =

Qubits
We can eﬀectively emulate spin-like qudits by coupling multiple qubits with an Unruh-
DeWitt interaction of the kind

the spin-like operator of the jth qubit. In the context of the phase estimation algorithm,
if we start in the state |+⟩⊗N where |+⟩≡(|0⟩+ |1⟩)/
√
2, then perform an interaction
generated by the above Hamiltonian, followed by performing an inverse quantum Fourier
77

transform F−1 on the N qubits as post-processing. To know the amplitude of the ﬁeld,
one could then project onto the standard basis.
Note that there is exponential energetic scaling between the couplings of each qubit.
This means that although our Hilbert space may grow exponentially with the number of
qubits, to emulate a qudit of such dimensions the energetic scaling is also exponential.
Hence, if we measure the information content in terms of qubits (as happens when one
computes entropies), then the maximal information content of a single qudit made of N
qubits (as above) scales as the logarithm of the energetic cost, which will scale as ∼2N,
as we will see in this chapter. As we will see in section 5.3, this logarithmic information
versus energy scaling behaviour will also be present for continuous variable registers, with
the number of qubits being instead replaced by the squeezing parameter.
Heisenberg-Weyl Qudits
We can consider an interaction between the ﬁeld and a clock-like qudit.
As we have
covered in the quantum information background section, the Heisenberg-Weyl operators
are generally unitaries but not Hermitian. Suppose we construct an observable of the kind
X + X†, where X is a Heisenberg-Weyl “shift” operator. Now, suppose we consider an
interaction of the form
(X + X†) ⊗Φλ
(5.39)
and now suppose we split up the ﬁeld into left and right-moving parts, Φ(x) = Φ+(x) +
Φ−(x) where
Φ±(x±) ≡
Z
R+dω
1
√
4πω
h
a±ωe−iωx± + a†
±ωeiωx±i
.
(5.40)
then if we focus on the coupling to the left-moving term,
(X + X†) ⊗Φ+λ =
Z
R+dω
1
√
4πω
h
(X + X†)aωe−iωx + (X + X†)a†
ωeiωx+i
.
(5.41)
We can then do a counter-rotating wave approximation; the clock qudit ticks one way when
it absorbs a photon and another way when it emits one:
(X + X†) ⊗Φ+λ =
Z
R+dω
1
√
4πω
h
Xaωe−iωx + X†a†
ωeiωx+i
.
(5.42)
This is the interaction we will use in section 6.2. For more, see section 6.2 and [69].

Harmonic Oscillator probes
We can consider sampling the ﬁeld with a harmonic oscillator probe, just like we did in
our analysis of QET for harmonic lattices. To measure a smeared observable
Φλ =
Z
R
dx λ(x)Φ(x).
(5.43)
the interaction Hamiltonian for Alice should be of the form δ(t)HA where
HA = P ⊗Φλ.
(5.44)
5.3.2
Continuous-Variable Multipoint Measurement
Setup
We consider how to perform continuous-variable phase estimation to sample the eigenvalue
of multiple smeared ﬁeld observables at once.
The interaction Hamiltonian for Alice is of the form δ(t)HA where
HA =
L
X
j=1
Z
R
dx λj(x) Pj ⊗Φ(x) =
X
j∈A
Pj ⊗Φλj
(5.45)
where the λj are coupling functions, Pj is the P quadrature of the jth probe harmonic
oscillator, and |A| ≡L.
Depending on the desired precision in the estimation of the amplitudes of the ﬁeld, the
initial state of the set of L harmonic oscillator probes (Hilbert space HC = NL
j=1 HCj)
can be squeezed accordingly. In general, for our purposes the initial state of the harmonic
oscillator control systems (probes) will be a product state of single-mode squeezed states
|⃗ξ⟩C =
L
O
j=1
|ξj⟩Cj
(5.46)
where |ξ⟩is as deﬁned in (4.26) and (4.27).
This is the same setup in the case of QET with a harmonic lattice, it is simply multiple
instances of the continuous-variable phase estimation procedure in parallel.
79

Energetic Cost of Measurement
The initial state of the ﬁeld is in its ground state, |0⟩F and the set of L probe harmonic os-
cillators are in a product state of individually squeezed states, each with the same squeezing
parameter ξ = r ∈R. Thus for the joint system, the initial state is
|Ψ0⟩≡|⃗ξ⟩C |0⟩F
(5.47)
where |⃗ξ⟩is as deﬁned in (5.46), with constant squeezing parameters ξj ≡−r ∀j. The
subscripts C and F are used to indicate whether the state is in the (C) control (probes’)
Hilbert space or in the quantum ﬁeld’s (F) Hilbert space.
Alice’s measurement interaction is that of (5.45), with a temporally instantaneous
coupling4, i.e. δ(t)HA where
HA =
L
X
j=1
Pj ⊗Φλj
(5.48)
where the λj are coupling functions, Pj is the P quadrature of the jth probe harmonic
oscillator. For our purposes, we will assume that the λj are disjoint.

(5.49)
Now, we are interested in the energy injected into the ﬁeld by this interaction. Because
we consider the probe to have no free Hamiltonian, by energy conservation, the change in
energy in the ﬁeld after versus before the interaction will necessarily come as an energetic
“switching cost” for the classical agent which controls the interaction. Indeed, introducing
time dependence into the Hamiltonian means that energy is not conserved. We can imagine
there is a classical energy reservoir which switches the interaction term. Hence, to compute
how much energy is invested in the process of measurement, we can calculate the change
in energy as follows:
∆E = ⟨Ψ0| U †
AHFUA |Ψ0⟩−⟨Ψ0| HF |Ψ0⟩.
(5.50)
4Note that, in the above case the interaction Hamiltonian is δ(t)HA, we will sometimes refer to HA itself
as the interaction Hamiltonian (or for other interactions the interaction Hamiltonian modulo the temporal
switching function). Note that this will be an abuse of terminology done for the sake of simplicity, as
without the δ(t) this is not technically and interaction Hamiltonian (not the right units).
80

Now, to facilitate this calculation, let B be an orthogonal basis for L2(R) such that λj ∈
B ∀j ∈{1, ..., L}, i.e. B includes all the smearing functions being used here as well as the
rest of the functions necessary to make this an orthogonal basis for the square integrable
functions. From our previous construction in this chapter, given this basis, we know we
can express the Hamiltonian as:
HF = 1

(5.51)
Now, we can compute U †
AHFUA using the Hadamard lemma5, but before we do so, let us
compute the following commutators which will be of use to us:
[Φλj, Πf] = i(λj, f)
∥f∥2
=⇒[Φλj, Π2
f] = [Φλj, Πf]Πf + Πf[Φλj, Πf] = 2iΠf

We see that the shift in energy has two terms: one is the product of ﬁrst moments of
the oscillators (probe and ﬁeld subsystems) and the other term is simply proportional
to the variance of the probes’ quadrature which couples to the ﬁeld times the smearing
function norm squared.
As we chose initial states for the ﬁeld and probes that have
vanishing ﬁrst moments, only the variance term survives. Recall that the variance in the
Pj quadratures was related to our degree of squeezing; ⟨ξ| P 2
j |ξ⟩= 1
2e2r, i.e. for stronger
squeezing parameter r there is a greater variance in the quadrature and hence in the energy

Now, to complete the phase estimation algorithm, Alice could projectively measure the
⃗X quadratures to complete the phase estimation algorithm, that is, if Alice and Bob want
to perform the LOCC version of QET.
Now, since the LOCC and LOQC versions of the protocol are equivalent, we will skip
the projective measurement step and keep the whole protocol coherent.
Information Gain
To compute the information gain, instead of considering the ancillary oscillators as the
control registers and the ﬁeld as the target, we consider the ﬁeld as the target and the
oscillators as the control6. Instead of using the Gaussian state formalism that we have
developed directly to get the post-interaction covariance matrix of the probe, we will
instead expand the ﬁeld with respect to its wavefunctional.7
We again begin with the initial state
|Ψ0⟩≡|⃗ξ⟩C |0⟩F
(5.56)
and interact with an interaction Hamiltonian δ(t)HA, same as before. We can expand HA
6In general in any controlled unitary gate, the role of control and target are inversed if one looks at the
conjugate quantum variables instead. In other words, Fourier transforming both registers eﬀectively ﬂips
the target and control. This is fairly standard in quantum computing.
7Why? Well to switch things up a bit.

(5.59)
and we see that it is a multi-oscillator displacement operator dependent on ϕ averaged over
the coupling function of each oscillator. Essentially, it displaces the X quadratures of the
oscillators dependent on each ﬁeld conﬁguration. We can apply this to our initial state
|Ψ1⟩≡UA |Ψ0⟩=
Z
Dϕ ⟨ϕ|0⟩D(⃗Γϕ) |⃗ξ⟩⊗|ϕ⟩.
(5.60)
We see that we get an entangled superposition of squeezed coherent states in the probe
oscillators entangled with the ﬁeld conﬁgurations. The |⃗ξ⟩squeezed state approximates
83

an |⃗x⟩eigenstate which serves as a pointer variable, while D(⃗Γϕ) displaces the oscillators’
Xj quadrature by an amount
R
λ(x)ϕ(x) dependent on the ﬁeld conﬁguration as sampled
by the coupling function. This is averaged over the quantum ﬁeld’s ground state’s wave-
function. The oscillators essentially soak up information about the ﬁeld conﬁguration as
viewed from the “point of view” of their window functions (couplings).
Let us trace out the ﬁeld (in the ﬁeld conﬁguration basis) to obtain the marginal density
operator for the ancillary harmonic oscillators. Let D(⃗Γϕ) |⃗ξ⟩≡|⃗Γϕ, ⃗ξ⟩denote the squeezed
displaced states of the oscillators.

It clearly should be a Gaussian state of the oscillators, as our interactions were linear and
the quantum ﬁeld is in its vacuum which is a Gaussian state. Let us compute the ﬁrst and

G(1)(x, y) ≡⟨0| {Φ(x), Φ(y)} |0⟩= ⟨0| Φ(x)Φ(y) + Φ(y)Φ(x) |0⟩.
(5.67)
So essentially, the correlations of the ancillary oscillators’ target quadrature are that of the
quantum ﬁeld’s correlation function averaged with respect to the coupling functions of the
respective oscillators. We have a few more covariance matrix elements to compute:
⟨PjPk⟩=

(5.70)
while the mixed (one odd, one even) indices are null,
σ(2j−1)(2k) = 0 = σ(2j)(2k−1)
∀j, k ∈{1, ..., L}.
(5.71)
Now that we have calculated the full set of covariance matrix elements after the inter-
action, we would like to ﬁnd the symplectic eigenvalues in order to compute the entropy
of the apparatus. As we started with pure states for the ﬁeld and the probe oscillators
and made these systems interact in a way that would entangle them, the post-interaction
entropy of our ancillary system is directly proportional to the mutual information between
the probes and the quantum ﬁeld as a whole. As our goal with this measurement is to
estimate a ﬁeld quadrature’s value (smeared over a certain region).
To compute the entanglement entropy of the ancillary oscillators, we must ﬁrst ﬁnd the
symplectic eigenvalues of the matrix σ. To ﬁnd the symplectic eigenvalues [3], we want

hence as r increases so does the entanglement entropy, and also as the variance of the
ﬂuctuations Υ. We see that the entanglement entropy is thus linear in r, the squeezing
parameter, but the energetic cost, as seen in (5.55), grows exponentially with the squeezing
parameter.

Discrete Variable Multipoint Measurement
Energy injection
We can consider the energy injection for a multi-point phase estimation procedure using
qubits or, equivalently, spin-like qudits. Suppose we have a set of indices A for the sample
points, and smearings {λk}k∈A ⊂B for some orthogonal basis B of the square integrable
functions. The interaction Hamiltonian is of the form
HA ≡

Thus we see that the energy invested in the ﬁeld scales at the square of the dimensions
of the qudit. Hence, for n qubits forming a 2n dimensional qudit, the energy would scale
as ∆E ∼O(e2n). Thus, to perform phase estimation with qubits, the energy scales ex-
ponentially with the number of qubits. Note that this is very similar to the fact that the
energy injection in the continuous variable case scales as the exponential of the squeezing
parameter r.

Harvesting Quantum Information & Entanglement
In the above, we used quantum memories to store information about the quantum ﬁeld.
Speciﬁcally, this was classical information about a certain observable of the ﬁeld, obtained
by either continuous-variable or discrete/continuous variable hybrid versions of the phase
estimation algorithm. In this section, instead of harvesting classical information, we aim to
swap quantum information contained in a “subsystem” of the quantum ﬁeld onto a certain
quantum memory. To this end, we will construct a protocol which loads quantum infor-
mation about the ﬁeld onto a continuous-variable probe’s memory. We will also consider
how this protocol can be adapted to discrete-variable quantum probes, which will yield a
form of Quantum Analog-to-Digital Converter (QADC). Finally, we will explore how such
a swapping of quantum information can be used to harvest entanglement from the vacuum.

5.4.1
Swapping Quantum Information
Continuous Variable
Let us ﬁrst study a continuous-variable version of the SWAP gate [71], which can be
decomposed in various diﬀerent ways:
U1↔2 = eiX1P2eiπa†
1a1e−iP1X2e−iX1P2
= eiπa†
1a1e−iX1P2e−iP1X2e−iX1P2

1a1e
π
2 (a†

(5.90)
we see that it is a passive Gaussian transformation10 followed by a phase rotation. Both
of these are Gaussian transformations. Using our knowledge of Gaussian transformations,
we can work out the representation of the SWAP gate on phase space. First, the transfor-
mation U ≡e−iX1P2e−iP1X2e−iX1P2 = eiπ
2 (X2P1−X1P2) = e

Thus the representation on the ladder operators looks like −i(Y ⊕Y ) where Y is the usual
2 × 2 Pauli matrix σy. Notice that, up to a phase correction, the information in system 2
has already been transferred to system 1, all that remains for us to obtain Following this
transformation, the phase ﬂip eiπa†
1a1 has the matrix representation given by −(Z ⊕Z), Z
being the usual σz. So, the swap gate, which is the composition of the passive Gaussian
transformation and the phase ﬂip gate, is given by

We see that it is indeed a gate that implements a swapping of the states in phase space.
Now, the above gate works for any two harmonic oscillators, hence, to apply this concept
to quantum ﬁelds, we must identify how to interact with a “single oscillator subsystem” of
the quantum ﬁeld. Our approach will then consist of swapping the states between a probe
oscillator system an that of the quantum ﬁeld.
In our above construction, we have the quadratures X1, P1, X2, P2, we can consider
the qudratures X1 and P1 to be the quadratures of the probe harmonic oscillator. As for
X2 and P2, we would like to deﬁne them in terms of some type of smeared observables of
the quantum ﬁeld. as those we have covered in this chapter. We can deﬁne the following
quadratures:
X2 7→Φλ ≡
Z
R
dxλ(x)Φ(x),
P2 7→Πλ ≡
1
∥λ∥2
Z
R
dxλ(x)Π(x),
(5.94)
where, as one may recall, the norm in the above is the usual L2(R) norm, ∥λ∥≡∥λ∥2,
and the above normalization guarantees that these two operators obey the usual canonical
commutation relations [Φλ, Πλ] = i.
As we have covered, in this chapter, these new operators we have deﬁned can be con-
sidered to be observables of a “subsystem” of the quantum ﬁeld. Since they obey the
usual canonical commutation relations, we can consider this subsystem’s Hilbert space to
be eﬀectively that of a harmonic oscillator. Thus, the state of this subsystem will have a
certain phase space representation, we can compute the ﬁrst and second moments of the
the state of the quantum ﬁeld in terms of the quadratures we have deﬁned. For example,
given the initial state of the ﬁeld being the ground state, an element of the covariance
matrix would be given by ⟨0| ΦλΦλ |0⟩=
R
dxλ(x)
R
dyλ(y) ⟨0| Φ(x)Φ(y) |0⟩, which is the
usual Wightmann ﬁeld correlator averaged with respect to the spatial coupling function.
91

Before we restrict ourselves to speciﬁc cases, let us construct the sequence of interac-
tions between the probe and the ﬁeld which must be executed in order to swap quantum
information between the ﬁeld and the probe. Let X, P, c, c† be the quadratures and
ladder operators of the probe oscillator, while Φλ and Πλ are the ﬁeld observables deﬁned
in (5.94). Looking back at (5.95), it is clear that we want to implement the sequence of
unitaries given by:
Uswap = eiπcc†e−iX⊗Πλe−iP⊗Φλe−iX⊗Πλ.
(5.95)
To perform the ﬁrst 3 unitaries in this sequence, we can consider a sequence of instantaneous
interactions. For ϵ inﬁnitesimal, we could consider the time evolution operator generated
by the interaction Hamiltonian given by
HI(t) = δ(t)X ⊗Πλ + δ(t −ϵ)P ⊗Φλ + δ(t −2ϵ)X ⊗Πλ.
(5.96)
With HF being the free Hamiltonian of the ﬁeld, the time evolution operation for the
interaction is given by
T exp

−i
Z 3ϵ
−ϵ
dt (HI(t) + HF)

= e−iX⊗Πλe−iP⊗Φλe−iX⊗Πλ + O(ϵ)
(5.97)
thus up to O(ϵ) corrections, we would get the correct unitary sequence for the swap gate.
For our purposes, we will consider the limit where ϵ →0; we will drop the above correction
factor from our calculations for simplicity.
Continuous to Discrete Variable
Recall that a qudit can be considered to have quadratures, i.e.
the generators of the
Heisenberg-Weyl Z and X, which are given by J and FJF† respectively. That is, to gen-
erate X instead of Z, if we replace interactions in the above by spin-like interactions (J
coupling) which are conjugated by Fourier transforms, then instead of generating transla-
tions of one quadrature, we generate translations of the conjugate variable.
As we have seen, we can emulate a 2N-dimensional qudit by using N qubits. Since we
know how to perform the quantum Fourier transform in a polynomial number of gates, we
can implement the swap gate with Unruh-deWitt interactions and a polynomial number of
multi-qubit gates. For simplicity, we ignore the time evolution of the ﬁeld in between the
92

various operations being applied, as an idealization we consider them to be instantaneous.
The interaction Hamiltonian begins with
δ(t)
N
X
j=1
sj ⊗Πλ = δ(t)
N
X
j=1
2j
2N σ(j)
z
⊗Πλ ≡δ(t)J ⊗Πλ
(5.98)
where we deﬁned J for convenience
J ≡
N
X
j=1
sj =
N
X
j=1
2j
2N σ(j)
z .
(5.99)
Note that here J is the generator of the Heisenberg-Weyl Z operator for the emulated
qudit, it is composed of the individual spins with diﬀerent couplings.
Following the above interaction, the inverse quantum Fourier transform, F†, is applied
onto the qubits. Following this, we make an interaction of the form δ(t −t1)J ⊗Φλ where
t1 is the time at which this interaction is applied, we assume it is very close to 0 as our
idealization. Following this second interaction, we apply the Quantum Fourier transform
onto the qubits, F, then ﬁnally the third interaction δ(t −t2)J ⊗Πλ, where t2 is assumed
to be inﬁnitesimally close to t1 for convenience. At this point, we can apply a “qudit
NOT gate” if we want to have a full swap gate. As one can check, applying the Fourier
transform twice, i.e. F2 = FF is one way to do the trick, as FFZF†F† = FXF† = Z†,
which means that a standard qudit basis vector would get mapped as |j⟩7→|−j⟩as desired.
There are other ways to implement this gate, but for our purposes we will use the double
Fourier approach. Thus, under time evolution by the above interactions punctuated by the
transformations on the qubits described above, in the limit of instantaneous operations,
we get that the total swap gate looking like
Uswap = F2e−iJ⊗ΠλFe−iJ⊗ΦλF†e−iJ⊗Πλ.
(5.100)
Note that if we really want to optimize the number of gates need for the swap, as F3 = F†,
we could instead perform
Uswap = eiJ⊗ΠλF†e−iJ⊗ΦλF†e−iJ⊗Πλ
(5.101)
instead. In any case, with 3 diﬀerent pulses of interactions between the ﬁeld and the qubits,
and with a polynomial number of gates on the qubits, we can achieve a continuous-variable
to discrete variable swap gate.
93

For large dimensions, this conversion from quantum analog (quantum ﬁeld) to quan-
tum digital (qubits) should have a good level of precision, just like in the phase estimation
algorithm where increasing the number of qubits aided in adding precision to the measure-
ment. Our construction is essentially a Quantum Analog-to-Digital converter, which we
could call a QADC. The usual “quantization error” from sampling theory in this case is
bit and phase ﬂip errors, i.e. errors caused by our attempt to take a state on an inﬁnite
Wigner phase space and map it to a discrete Wigner function over a ﬁnite space. Geomet-
rically, this is like transferring a function which is deﬁned on the real plane onto a toroidal
mesh, in the limit of inﬁnitely ﬁne mesh on the torus, any function which has compact
(or approximately compact, like a Gaussian) should be accurately represented on the mesh.
Although this QADC could be of great interest, for the purpose of our calculations we
will stick to the continuous-variable probe case, as it is mathematically cleaner while being
fully analogous to an idealized (asymptotic) case of the QADC. Additionally, the analysis
for estimating the amplitude of a wavefunction, in the context of basic quantum mechanics
rather than QFT, using a quantum analog-to-digital converter has been done previously
[62].
5.4.2
Energetic Cost of Swap
We can compute the energetic cost of a swap gate when swapping the state of a probe har-
monic oscillator with that of a subspace of the ﬁeld, for an initial state of the ﬁeld being
in vacuum. Instead of working in the Schrodinger picture, we can work in the Heisenberg
picture, that is, instead of transforming the states, we can transform the operators for
which we take expectation values.
Consider a harmonic oscillator with quadratures X and P, and some initial state |ψ⟩.
Now, consider the set of quadratures of smeared observables, Φλ and Πλ, as in (5.94), for
a function λ compactly supported, belonging in some orthogonal basis B for L2(R). Now,
say we perform the swap unitary between these two Hilbert spaces, without the last phase
correction11, that is
U ≡eiπ
2 (PΦλ−XΠλ) = e−iXΠλe−iPΦλe−iXΠλ.
(5.102)
11In the case of applying the full swap with the phase correction, as it is at the end of the sequence of
unitaries and it commutes with the ﬁeld’s Hamiltonian (as it acts strictly on the probe), the end result is the
same. Let V be the phase unitary on the probe, then [V ⊗I, I ⊗H] = 0 =⇒(V † ⊗I)(I ⊗H)(V ⊗I) = H.
94

Now, recall that the Hamiltonian of the ﬁeld can be written as
HF = 1
2
X
f∈B
Π2
f∥f∥2 + 1
2
X
f,g∈B
ΦfΦg
(f ′, g′)
∥f∥2∥g∥2.
(5.103)
and so if we look at how the unitary swap maps the operators in the summands, for
f, g ∈B, it can be shown that
U †ΦfU = Xδfλ + Φf(1 −δfλ),
U †ΠfU = Pδfλ + Πf(1 −δfλ),
(5.104)
that is, the swap gate maps operators in one Hilbert space (the subspace of the ﬁeld) into
corresponding operators in the other Hilbert space (that of the probe). Note in the above
we denote δfλ ≡δ[f −λ] the delta measure with respect to an appropriate measure on B.
Now, we are ready to compute the energetic cost of performing this swap gate. Consider
an initial state |Ψ0⟩≡|ψ⟩|0⟩where |ψ⟩is some generic pure state of the probe12 while |0⟩
is the quantum ﬁeld’s vacuum. Let ⟨·⟩≡⟨Ψ0| · |Ψ0⟩,

5.4.3
Entanglement Harvesting from the Vacuum
We can use our swap gate to construct a protocol for entanglement harvesting. That is, as
certain states of the quantum ﬁeld can have spacelike entanglement between subsystems,
if we swap quantum information from subsystems of the ﬁeld onto harmonic oscillator
probes, then initially unentangled probes become entangled.
The concept of harvesting entanglement has been around for over three decades [64],
it has been an active ﬁeld of research ever since, with further advances towards imple-
mentability being recently made [56, 57]. The goal of this subsection is to contribute to
this body of literature by considering a fairly ideal case (instantaneous couplings, harmonic
oscillator probes, resulting in perfect swap gates), to see what is the limit of how much
entanglement one can harvest using only two compactly supported probes.
Consider Alice and Bob, which are spacelike separated. Suppose Alice has access to a
region A of space, while Bob has access to region B. Let λ and µ be real-valued functions
which are compactly supported on these regions, with mutually disjoint support, A =
supp(λ), B = supp(µ), and A∩B = ∅. We can use these functions to deﬁne the subsystems
96

of the quantum ﬁeld Alice and Bob will have access to, let
ΦA ≡Φλ =
Z
R
dxλ(x)Φ(x),
ΠA ≡Πλ =
1
∥λ∥2
Z
R
dxλ(x)Π(x),
ΦB ≡Φµ =
Z
R
dxµ(x)Φ(x),
ΠB ≡Πµ =
1
∥µ∥2
Z
R
dxµ(x)Π(x).
(5.109)
Note that, for λ and µ with disjoint support, we have that the A subsystem ﬁeld quadra-
tures commute with that of the B subsystem. This again ﬁts into the formalism of ﬁeld
subsystems we ahve covered in this chapter. We consider Alice and Bob to each have in
their possession a probe harmonic oscillator, these have quadratures XA, PA, XB and PB.
Alice and Bob’s task will be to swap quantum information from the ﬁeld subsystems they
have access to onto their respective probe oscillators. To do so, they can both perform
the continuous-variable swap gate as we have seen previously, and since their operations
commute, they can perform these simultaneously. So, Alice’s operations are given by
UA ≡eiπcAc†
Ae−iXA⊗ΠAe−iPA⊗ΦAe−iXA⊗ΠA
(5.110)
where cA ≡(XA + iPA)/
√
2 is a ladder operator for Alice’s probe oscillator. Similarly for
Bob, he applies the following sequence of unitaries on his systems:
UB ≡eiπcBc†
Be−iXB⊗ΠBe−iPB⊗ΦBe−iXB⊗ΠB
(5.111)
where cB ≡(XB +iPB)/
√
2 is a ladder operator for Alice’s probe oscillator. The last pulse
in the sequence is a local unitary on the probe system, although it is useful for having the
ﬁnal post-sequence state of the probe be exactly that of the ﬁeld subspace, as it is a local
unitary it will not aﬀect the harvesting of entanglement.
Now, as we have seen from our previous construction of the swap gate, the state in
phase space gets swapped (completely accurately in our idealized case of instantaneous
interactions). So, eﬀectively, the ﬁrst and second moments of the quadratures get swapped
as
XA ↔ΦA,
PA ↔ΠA,
XB ↔ΦB,
PB ↔ΠB.
(5.112)
Now, let us compute the collected entanglement in the speciﬁc case where we are
collecting entanglement for a massless quantum scalar ﬁeld in 1+1 dimensions. Suppose
97

we start with the vacuum state of the ﬁeld |0⟩F and some initial states for the harmonic
oscillators, |ψ0⟩AB, which, for our purposes we can assume to be a product state that is
Gaussian, |ψ0⟩AB ≡|A0⟩A |B0⟩B. So, overall, the initial state is given by
|Ψ0⟩≡|0⟩F |ψ0⟩AB = |0⟩F |A0⟩A |B0⟩B .
(5.113)
Let us deﬁne |Ψ1⟩as the state after Alice and Bob’s unitaries are performed
|Ψ1⟩≡UAUB |Ψ0⟩.
(5.114)
Now, if we consider the Gaussian state representation of this state for the quadratures
XA, PA, XB, PB, ΦA, ΠA, ΦB, ΠB, we would see that the ﬁrst and second moments
as they were initially have been swapped as in equation (5.112). Thus, to get the Wigner
function of the probe oscillators after the swap (i.e. for |Ψ1⟩), we simply have to compute
the covariance matrix elements of the ﬁeld subsystems pre-swap (i.e., for |Ψ0⟩). To make
this key statement clear, let us introduce some notation, let us deﬁne the following vectors
of operators
⃗O ≡




XA
PA
XB
PB



,
⃗R ≡




ΦA
ΠA
ΦB
ΠB



.
(5.115)
Then the ﬁrst moments of the probe oscillators post-swap can be shown to be null:
dj = ⟨Ψ1| Oj |Ψ1⟩= ⟨Ψ0| Rj |Ψ0⟩= 0 since ⟨0| Φ(x) |0⟩= ⟨0| Π(x) |0⟩= 0 ∀x.
(5.116)
Now, as for the second moments (using the fact that we computed the ﬁrst moments as
null) are given by
σij = 1
2 ⟨Ψ1| {Oi, Oj} |Ψ1⟩= 1
2 ⟨Ψ0| {Ri, Rj} |Ψ0⟩= 1
2 ⟨0| RiRj + RjRi |0⟩.
(5.117)
And so, as we can compute these covariance matrix elements explicitly (they are two-point
functions averaged with respect to the λ and µ coupling functions), then we know exactly
that the entanglement harvested by these oscillators is the totality of the entanglement
between the A and B subsystems of the quantum ﬁeld that we have deﬁned.
For simplicity, let us assume that the smearing functions are normalized13
∥λ∥= ∥µ∥= 1.
(5.118)
13The same calculation is not much more diﬃcult with the smearings unnormalized, it diﬀers by having
factors of ∥λ∥−2 and ∥µ∥−2 for each momentum smearing. This breaks the block matrix symmetry (see
(5.119), the covariance matrix is made up of blocks doubly smearing the B matrix, the same for all four
blocks), hence for visual simplicity we have chosen to go for the normalized case.
98

The covariance matrix is given by
σAB =

R

dy
λ(x)λ(y)B(x, y)
λ(x)µ(y)B(x, y)
λ(x)µ(y)B(x, y)


(5.119)
where B(x, y) is a matrix-valued function dependent on the ﬁeld’s vacuum correlators
B(x, y) ≡1

⟨0| {Φ(x), Φ(y)} |0⟩
⟨0| {Φ(x), Π(y)} |0⟩
⟨0| {Φ(x), Π(y)} |0⟩
⟨0| {Π(x), Π(y)} |0⟩

.
(5.120)
For our speciﬁc case of massless ﬁelds in 1+1 dimensions, we can compute more explic-
itly the two-point functions which make up the B matrix:
B(x, y) = 1

(5.121)
As we are working in 1+1 dimensions with a massless scalar ﬁeld on a noncompact spatial
interval, these integrals diverge because of the well-known UV/IR divergences. There are
technically ways one can regulate these integrals by adding ultraviolet and infrared cutoﬀs
[59], suppose we require Υ < |k| < Ω, then :
⟨0| Φ(x)Φ(y) |0⟩=
1
2π [Ci(Ω(x −y)) −Ci(Υ(x −y))]
(5.122)

2π(x −y)2
+ Ωsin(Ω(x −y)) −Υ sin(Υ(x −y))
2π(x −y)
(5.123)
where Ci is known as the cosine integral function.
Note that, depending on the choice of smearing, we may not need an IR cutoﬀ. Using
the following notation for the Fourier transform:
˜f(ω) =

hence for compactly supported functions λ and µ, the infrared divergence is taken care of.
On the other hand, the UV divergence of the diagonal terms (j = m) remains and has to
be dealt with by using the UV-regularized Green’s function.
Thus, we have shown how to compute the elements of the joint covariance matrix σAB.
Because we should expect the state to be mixed on this subspace (indeed the region A ∪B
will be entangled with its complement, hence the state on A ∪B will be mixed) then we
cannot use a simple formula for entanglement entropy being the entropy of a marginal.
Instead, what we can use is the logarithmic negativity, which provides a bound on the
amount of distillable entanglement that was extracted [2].
To compute this measure of entanglement, we can take the “partial transpose” of the
density matrix ρTA
AB, in phase space, this amounts to performing the following transforma-

Chapter 6
QET with Quantum Fields
The protocol of QET relies heavily on the quality (and quantity) of the information col-
lected by Alice during her measurement. In this section, we model local POVMs on a
quantum ﬁeld via a local interaction of the ﬁeld with an measurement probe system. By
varying our measurement scheme, we can explore how QET relies on the amount of knowl-
edge gained by our agents (Alice and Bob) via measurement, and see how Bob can optimally
exploit this measurement information via his knowledge of the correlations between Alice’s
measurement results and his local ﬁeld conﬁgurations.
We ﬁnd the optimal QET scheme for linear interactions between a ﬁrst-quantized sys-
tem and the ﬁeld, for both the measurement and energy extraction steps of the protocol.
In doing so, we develop machinery that provides an operational interpretation to Shannon
sampling theory of quantum ﬁelds [59].

Multi-Sample QET with Harmonic Oscillators
6.1.1
Setup
For the quantum ﬁeld, we consider a 1+1 dimensional massless Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, quan-
tized in the null coordinates (x± ≡t ± x), we consider the left and right-moving sectors
independently [30]:

where : ∗: denotes normal ordering and the labels +, −denote left and right-moving
components respectively.
Since the left moving (+) and right-moving (−) parts of the ﬁeld are decoupled, we can
act upon them individually. In order to make it plain that the energy will be teleported
rather than transported from A to B, we will couple A and B only to the left moving
modes, while B is allowed to be to the right of A. As we will work exclusively with left
moving modes, for convenience we drop their + subscript.

Energy Calculation
6.1.3
Energetic Cost of Measurement
We start with an initial state of the ﬁeld in its ground state, |0⟩F and the set of L probe
harmonic oscillators are in a product state of individually squeezed states, each with the
same squeezing parameter ξ = r ∈R. Thus for the joint system, the initial state is
|Ψ0⟩≡|⃗ξ⟩C |0⟩F
(6.5)
where |⃗ξ⟩is as deﬁned in (5.46), with constant squeezing parameters ξj ≡−r ∀j. The
subscripts C and F are used to indicate whether the state is in the (C) control (probes’)

Alice’s measurement interaction is that of (5.45), with a temporally instantaneous
coupling restricted to the left-moving component of the ﬁeld, i.e. δ(t)HA where

is a multi-frequency displacement operator of the ﬁeld, whose displacement parameter is
dependent on the state of the control harmonic oscillators with respect to the ⃗P eigenbasis.
Eﬀectively, this is like a controlled-displacement gate, with the harmonic oscillators as the
control and the quantum ﬁeld as the target.
The state of the system after the interaction is given by

(6.11)
where |⃗p · ⃗α⟩= D(⃗p · ⃗α) |0⟩is a coherent state of the ﬁeld.
We can compute the energy invested in the ﬁeld by Alice’s interaction by computing
the diﬀerence in total energy in the ﬁeld before and after the interaction,
EA = ⟨Ψ1| I ⊗HF |Ψ1⟩−⟨Ψ0| I ⊗HF |Ψ0⟩= ⟨Ψ1| I ⊗HF |Ψ1⟩

(6.15)
Which is simply the integrated energy spectral density of the individual coupling windows
(which equals the two-norm1 of λ), times the number of coupling sites L, times the variance
of the quadratures e2r of the oscillators we couple to.
Now, if we would like to perform the LOCC version of QET, Alice could projectively
measure the ⃗x quadratures, and relay the classical information to Bob. Now, since the
LOCC and LOQC versions of the protocol are equivalent, we will skip the projective
measurement step and keep the whole protocol coherent.
Time evolution
We can assume that there is a certain time evolution between when Alice performs her
operations and when Bob receives the information from Alice, this gap between operations
is of a time T.
Physically, any harmonic oscillator should have a free Hamiltonian, hence so should
our system of probe oscillators. If we were to label such a Hamiltonian as HP, the probes
1The p-norm of a function f is deﬁned as ∥f∥p ≡
 R
Rdx|f(x)|p1/p
105

would evolve according to a unitary free evolution operator UP = e−iHP T, this unitary
evolution could be countered by Bob by applying a local unitary U †
P on the probes. As
our interactions are instantaneous, this free Hamiltonian would not aﬀect our interactions’
time evolution operators (such as (6.10)) in the interaction picture.
Additionally, if we were to consider the probes to have a free Hamiltonian, when deal-
ing with energetics, we would have to consider the energy exchanges between the probes
systems, the ﬁeld, and the classical agent which switches on and oﬀthe interactions. To
simplify our analysis, as we are mainly interested in the energetics of the ﬁeld, and the
harmonic oscillators simply serve as information carriers, we can consider the probes to
have eﬀectively no free Hamiltonian.
Thus, for our purposes, we can consider the harmonic oscillators to have no free Hamil-
tonian, while the ﬁeld has the free Hamiltonian given by
HF =
Z
R+ dω ωa†
ωaω
(6.16)
hence we have the time evolution operator
UF = I ⊗e−iHF T
(6.17)
which, when applied to our post-Alice state |Ψ1⟩, gives
UF |Ψ1⟩=
Z
RLdL⃗p |⃗p⟩⟨⃗p|⃗ξ⟩⊗e−iHF T |⃗p · ⃗α⟩=
Z
RLdL⃗p |⃗p⟩⟨⃗p|⃗ξ⟩⊗|⃗p · ⃗Λ⟩
(6.18)
where Λj|ω = e−iωTαjω; the coherent state has been translated to the left:
|⃗p · ⃗Λ⟩= D(⃗p · ⃗Λ) |0⟩= e
PL
j=1
R
Rdx λj(x+T) Pj⊗Φ+(x) |0⟩.
(6.19)
As the ﬁeld is left-moving, the region Alice has targeted moves to the left. Hence, this will
aﬀect the eﬀective distance between Alice’s measurement and Bob’s target site; if Alice
and Bob are both stationary and initially at a distance L apart, then the distance between
Alice’s positive energy coherent state blob and Bob’s energy extraction site is going to be
L + T. This will factor into the output energy, as the output depends on the strength of
the correlations between the subsystem of the ﬁeld Alice measured and the subsystem Bob
targets.

6.1.4
Energy extraction
Bob’s action
Bob receives the L probe harmonic oscillators from Alice. Now, the information contained
in each harmonic oscillator is that of a local smeared observable speciﬁc to each oscilla-
tor. Similarly to Alice’s measurement targeting multiple regions, Bob’s action will involve
multiple interaction sites. As each of these sites could use the information from each of
Alice’s oscillators, there needs to be a way to replicate the information contained in Alice’s
oscillators. As the information of interest is classical (eigenvalue of an observable) this will
is possible.
Suppose Bob has M interaction sites, he has received L oscillators from Alice, then
he could could copy the ⃗X ∈RL quadrature information onto M oscillators by using the
continuous-variable analog of a CNOT (adder) gate, which we described in (4.30), applied
to near-X eigenstates2, which for simplicity we can assume to be inﬁnitely squeezed.
For our purposes, we can assume that the CNOT target states were inﬁnitely squeezed.
For discrete-variable probes, all we would need is a qudit C-X gate to spread the quadrature
information from one qudit to multiple.
In the LOCC version of the protocol, he would receive classical information about the
value of the X quadratures of Alice’s oscillators, Bob could then prepare near-eigenstates of
X using highly squeezed states, similar to the initial squeezed states of the probe harmonic
oscillators.
To keep our calculations simple, we will assume a non-local interaction designed to
mimic the eﬀect of the information replication protocol from above. Alternatively, as we
described in our chapter on QET on a lattice, we could separate Bob’s interaction into a
sequence of many pulses, as depicted in equation (4.41).
Consider Bob to have the interaction δ(t)HA where

thus we see3 that the exchange term goes as the distance square between Alice’s left-
propagated smearing and Bob’s smearing.
Now, theoretically, to make sure to extract energy, Bob has to optimize over his coupling
parameters θjk. Instead of repeating this optimization, we can reuse our result from our
QET on a lattice protocol, we will do so in the next subsection 6.1.5.
Before we move on, let us see what the teleported energy looks like for a single probe
protocol case; i.e., L = 1. In appendix A.1, we derive that for L = 1, i.e. for our matrices
of smeared correlators to become scalars, A 7→A, B 7→B, Q 7→Q,

112

As we will see later, this expression exactly matches4 what we obtain in the case where
we couple to both the left and right moving modes (6.60) and use our lattice energy
calculation technique.
6.1.5
Alternate Calculation: Field as a Lattice
Using the formalism we have developed in the previous chapter, we can port over our
calculation of QET on a lattice to QFT. The protocol will be slightly diﬀerent: we will
ignore the time evolution between Alice and Bob’s operations, and we will couple to both
left and right moving modes. Apart from these two changes the protocol remains the same.
Consider B to be an orthonormal basis for L2(R), that is, (f, g) = δ[f −g] ∀f, g ∈B
(note that previously we only assumed orthogonality rather than orthonormality), we can
express smeared observables for f ∈B as
Φf ≡
Z
R
dxf(x)Φ(x),
Πf ≡
Z
R
dxf(x)Π(x),
(6.41)
and the expansion of the Hamiltonian with respect to these operators is
HF = 1
2
X
f,g∈B

Π2
f + (f ′, g′)ΦfΦg

.
(6.42)
We can see the similarity with the Hamiltonian for a lattice, e.g. as in (4.16), but with the
K matrix being equivalent to (f ′, g′). In some sense, we can deﬁne a coupling “matrix”
over the index set of functions in B instead of an index set for lattice sites. Now, let us
construct the protocol, suppose we have Alice’s smearings be some subset BA ⊂B, and
that for all f ∈BA, we have f be of compact support. Now, suppose Alice couples to the
ﬁeld with respect to certain (unnormalized) orthogonal smearing functions {αj}j∈A, for
some set of indices j ∈A. Then, let us deﬁne the following for notational ease,
Λj ≡
αj
∥αj∥,
λj ≡∥αj∥,
BA = {Λj}j∈A ,
(6.43)
the set of normalized smearing functions for Alice.
Now, similarly to our previous protocol described in this section, Alice has an interaction
Hamiltonian δ(t)HA where
HA =
X
j∈A
λjPj ⊗ΦΛj =
X
j∈A
Z
R
dx αj(x) Pj ⊗Φ(x).
(6.44)
4Up to factors of 2, which are normal since we couple to both the left and right moving modes, and in
the limit T = 0.
113

Similarly to Alice, Bob has a set of smearing functions {βm}m∈B for which the normal-
ized versions of these functions lie in a subset of our choice of orthonormal basis for L2(R),
i.e.
µm ≡
βm
∥βm∥,
{µm}m∈B ≡BB ⊂B.
(6.45)
Now, the interaction for Bob is given by
HB =
X
j∈A,m∈B
θmjXj ⊗Πµm =
X
j∈A,m∈B
θmj
∥βm∥Xj ⊗
Z
R
dx βm(x) Π(x).
(6.46)
Now, notice that the above interactions for Alice and Bob are akin to equations (4.43) and
(4.44). Indeed, as the smeared ﬁeld operators obey the same commutation relations as the
lattice, that is
[Φf, Πg] = iδ[f −g],
for f, g ∈B
(6.47)
with other commutators vanishing, our calculations from the lattice carry over.
Thus, consider the initial of the ﬁeld and the probes |Ψ0⟩to be as in equation (5.47).
We deﬁne Alice’s unitary action as UA = e−iHA, and Bob’s action as UB = e−iHB. We
ignore the free evolution of the ﬁeld between Alice and Bob’s actions5.
We can compute Alice’s energy injection, using our previous analogous lattice results
(4.49),
EA = ⟨Ψ0| (U †
AHFUA −HF) |Ψ0⟩= 1
2
X
j∈A
λ2
j ⟨ξ|X2
j |ξ⟩= e2r
4
X
j∈A

j.
(6.48)
In the particular case where λj = λ ∀j ∈A, we get EA = e2r|A|λ2/4, where |A| denotes
the number of sites in A. We can compare the above result to our previous result in (6.15),
we get twice as much energy injected into the ﬁeld, this makes sense as we are coupling to
both the left and the right moving sectors in this calculation.
Now, we can also use our previous lattice QET formulas to compute the energy ex-
tracted by Bob. In order to port over all of our results, we need to translate the notation
a bit. As the index set for the smearings which are part of A and B is countable/ﬁnite in
5As we saw, considering only the left-moving part of the ﬁeld, the teleported energy is dependent on the
distance between Bob’s smearing and the left-moving lightfront coming from Alice’s smearing. In general
the QET term will depend on the distance to the lightcone emanating from Alice’s interaction. Note that
for our calculation without free time evolution, we can simply factor in this diﬀerence; we can consider
the distance between Alice and Bob in this case to be that of the distance of Bob to Alice’s lightcone in a
realistic scenario.
114

this setting, those pose no issue. The main challenge is to address sums which run over all
the lattice indices, as these become sums over all of our basis functions for L2(R). Let us
deﬁne the following matrix, inspired from their lattice counterparts

where in the above we used the fact that we assume that the smearing functions for Bob
are of compact support in order to integrate by parts and swap derivatives around. What
we get in the end is the second derivative of the Green’s function as an integral kernel
mediating the functional inner product between the smearing functions. We can make the
above expression even more explicit, notice
⟨0|Φ(x)Φ(y)|0⟩=

We see that we have a second order power law decay with the distance between Alice and
Bob. Note that in the case where we would time evolve and/or couple only to the left-
moving or right-moving part of the ﬁeld, the above would instead be two terms dependent
on the distance of Bob’s smearing to the lightcone originating at Alice’s interaction location.
115

Another matrix we can deﬁne that is analogous to the lattice case is6

and in the limit of inﬁnite squeezing r →∞, the ﬁrst term vanishes.
Finally, we already deﬁned the matrix θ in (6.45), let us deﬁne on last matrix:
Kjk ≡(µ′
j, µ′
k) =
Z
R
dxµ′
j(x)µ′
k(x),
j, k ∈B
(6.53)

k) = δjk(µ′

j) = δjk∥µ′∥2 =

Now, given all these matrices we have deﬁned, we can express the energy diﬀerence in
the ﬁeld due to Bob’s operation,
∆E = ⟨Ψ0|U †
AU †
BHUBUA −U †
AHUA|Ψ0⟩
(6.55)
using our previous result (4.70),
∆E = tr(θV ) + 1
2tr(KθMθT)
(6.56)
where the trace is over the indices in B. Now, recall that we found the optimal tuning of
Bob’s coupling constants for a given set of coupling constants for Alice, the optimal matrix
of couplings is given by
θ = −K−1V TM −1
(6.57)
and the optimal (most negative) change in energy of the ﬁeld due to Bob’s operations
is
∆Eopt = −1
2tr[V TM −1V K−1].
(6.58)
6γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
116

Single-probe case
We can expand these formulas for the teleported energy more explicity in the single-probe
case, i.e. if |A| = |B| = 1. Let

Asymptotically Limitless QET

which I was the lead author.
I included only the sections which I wrote independently

with minor edits from the co-authors. I am responsible for essentially all of the technical
contributions, I mention in the text where co-authors’ technical contributions appear.
In this section, we consider performing QET with a set of interaction Hamiltonians
that are not strictly local, that is, they eﬀectively have a power law decay smearing. We
show that, in a certain limit, one can have arbitrary amounts of energy teleported, even
accounting for the nonlocal energy injection.
6.2.1
Setup
For the quantum ﬁeld, we consider a 1+1 dimensional massless Klein-Gordon ﬁeld, quan-
tized in the null coordinates (x± ≡t ± x), we consider the left and right-moving sectors
independently [30]:
Φ(x) = Φ+(x+) + Φ−(x−),

Since the left moving (+) and right-moving (−) parts of the ﬁeld are decoupled, we can
consider acting upon each individually. In order to make it plain that the energy will be
teleported rather than transported from A to B, we will couple A and B only to the left
moving modes, while B is allowed to be to the right of A. As we will work exclusively with
left moving modes, for convenience we drop their + subscript.
6.2.2
The Protocol
Sender’s Action on the Field
We assume that the ﬁeld begins in the vacuum state |0⟩, hence the expectation of the
renormalized stress energy tensor vanishes everywhere. At t = 0−, A is in an arbitrary
initial state |A0⟩∈HA ≡Cd. To perform QET, A’s qudit is then at t = 0 coupled for an
instant to the ﬁeld via an interaction Hamiltonian δ(t)HA, which is a spatial smearing of a
Hamiltonian density with respect to a compactly supported smearing function λ : R →R,
i.e., HA ≡

becomes the Hamiltonian density when multiplied by λ(x). Later on, it will be useful for us
to write the spatial coupling factor as the product of the coupling strength times a spatial
proﬁle (with dimensions of inverse length) of unit L1(R) norm, i.e.
λ(x) = λ0Fa(x)
(6.71)
where
∥Fa∥1 ≡
Z ∞
−∞
dx F(x) = 1
(6.72)
Note that in the d = 2 qubit case, X = X† and we simply obtain HA(x) = X ⊗Π+(x),
which is the Unruh-DeWitt (UdW) detector model [18], similar to conventional QET [33].
119

Notice that for d > 2, X ̸= X† and therefore the Hamiltonian (6.70) cannot be written
as a tensor product of a qudit observable and a ﬁeld observable.
In fact, the form of
(6.70) resembles a counter-rotating wave interaction Hamiltonian, as seen in the context of
quantum optics. The subtleties regarding the locality of such an interaction model (pointed
out in [43]), will be discussed in full detail in section 6.2.6.
Using the eigendecomposition of the X operator, X = P

(proof of the above can be found in appendix A.2). We ﬁnd that it is the same as that of a
single coherent state, whose energy depends on the 2-norm of the derivative of the spatial
coupling λ. Note that we assume A’s qudit to have no free Hamiltonian, i.e., that it is a
gapless qudit.
120

Receiver’s Action on the Field
A now sends her ‘measurement’ information to B. To do so, she sends her probe qudit
directly to B via a quantum channel. We assume that the quantum channel preserves the
qudit as is, whereas the ﬁeld evolves according to its free Hamiltonian during the time of
qudit transmission, T. The state of the ﬁeld and A’s qudit after this time evolution is
given by
|Ψ2⟩≡UF(T) |Ψ1⟩=

⟨xj|A0⟩|xj⟩⊗|Λj⟩
(6.77)
where UF(T) ≡(I ⊗e−iHF T), |Λj⟩≡N∞
ω=0 |Λjω⟩, and Λjω ≡e−iωTζjω. Note that by energy
conservation in the ﬁeld during free evolution, EA = ⟨Ψ2| I ⊗HF |Ψ2⟩.
Now, at time T, B couples the probe he received from A with the ﬁeld according to
an interaction Hamiltonian δ(t)HB, similar to A’s.
It has again a spatial smearing of
a Hamiltonian density HB ≡
R
R dx µ(x)HB(x), with respect to a compactly supported
function, µ : R →R, where

(6.78)
Notice the diﬀerence with (6.70), here we use Z instead of X and µ(x) instead of λ(x),
otherwise, (6.78) is to Φ+(x) what (6.70) is to Π+(x); in the d = 2 case, the above becomes
Z ⊗Φ+(x). Same as in (6.71), it will be useful to write µ(x) as the product of a coupling
strength and a smearing function (with dimensions of inverse length) of unit L1(R) norm:
µ(x) ≡µ0Fb(x), where ∥Fb∥1 = 1. Note that because A and B’s couplings are of diﬀerent
nature (in the limit d = 2 they constitute respectively ﬁeld and momentum UdW coupling),
the coupling strengths µ0 and λ0 have diﬀering dimensions, as is clear also from the diﬀerent
powers of ω in (6.70) and (6.78). Similarly to (6.74), the time evolution operator associated
to B’s interaction is a controlled ﬁeld displacement, given by

6.2.3
Energy Extraction
To show that B can extract an average positive net work from the ﬁeld through his instan-
taneous local interaction, we compute the expectation value of the energy of the ﬁeld in
the ﬁnal state, and compare it to the energy right before B’s operation,

(6.82)
Note that the key property used in the computation of the above was the braiding relation
(2.24), a proof of the above is provided in appendix A.2. Since this ∆E is the change in the
energy in the ﬁeld caused by B’s local interaction, then any energy gained/lost in the ﬁeld
is necessarily lost or gained by B, i.e., by the classical agent which drives the switching of
the interaction Hamiltonian (6.78).
Classical Communication
So far, we assumed that A and B used a quantum channel for communication, i.e., that A
sends her qudit to B. Here we outline how an equivalent classical communication version
of the protocol can be obtained. After A’s interaction (6.75), A performs a projective
measurement in the Z basis (or more generally in the qudit’s eigenbasis for B’s interaction
Hamiltonian). Given an observed outcome i, the (pre-normalized) state of the ﬁeld is then

d factor to normalize |φi⟩comes from the fact that Z and X are mutually
unbiased bases [8]. Following this projective measurement, A then would transmit this
measurement result; the value i ∈Zd, to B via a log2(d) bit string. After a free evolution
of the ﬁeld for a time T, B then applies the D(ξi) unitary (as deﬁned in (6.79)), dependent
on the string received. The state of the ﬁeld then becomes

one can notice the similarity with (6.80); indeed |φ′

an expectation value of HF for the above state while averaging over the possible values of

We conclude that the quantum and classical communication versions of the protocols yield
the same outcome in terms of average teleported energy.
For illustration, in the classical communication version of the new protocol, let us
assume A begins with an initial qudit state |A0⟩that is a basis state mutually unbiased
to the X and Z eigenbases (e.g. an XZm eigenstate for d prime, m ∈Zd). Then after
A’s interaction through (6.70) and projective measurement on the qudit, the ﬁeld is in
a uniform superposition of d coherent states in the ﬁeld, i.e., a Cat state, akin to those
depicted in Fig.6.1.
Figure 6.1: Single-mode Wigner pseudoprobability distribution for the cat state (⟨0| ⊗
I) |Ψ1⟩, i.e., the phase space representation of a single mode of the ﬁeld if A measured her
qudit in the |0⟩state after her interaction. The initial qudit state |A0⟩chosen here was an
XZ† eigenstate. The parameter α = 2.5 is ﬁxed and we plot for various probe dimensions,
labelled d. As the dimensions grow, the distribution loses some of its isotropy, allowing for
energy extraction when displaced along an appropriate direction.
Setup for Optimal Extraction
Let us now analyse in what circumstances B was able to extract work from the ﬁeld, that
is, ∆E < 0. We notice that the ﬁrst term in (6.81) is positive and is the energy that B
invests in the ﬁeld by switching on his coupling, similar to the energy A invested in (6.76).
123

The second term of (6.81) is the one of interest, since it may become negative and
overcome the positivity of the ﬁrst term. The Fourier integral, I ≡
R
R+dω ωeiωTα∗
ωβω,
using [46], can be rewritten as
I =−1

Z

(y−x+T)2.
(6.86)
We see that the real part is non-vanishing strictly on the left-moving light-front, while the
imaginary part is non-vanishing everywhere. Hence, only the imaginary part can allow B
to extract work even if he is not light-like separated and to the left of A; this is the term
that gives us the “teleportation” aspect of QET. Notice that the second term in (6.81) is
comprised of the real part of the product I · Γ where
Γ ≡⟨A0| XZ† |A0⟩e(e2πi/d−1)∥α∥2
(6.87)
is a functional dependent on the coupling proﬁle and strength of A, the dimensions of the
probe, and the initial qudit state. In general, we will have |Γ| ≤1. Looking back at (6.81),
one sees that to maximize the teleported energy, the imaginary part of Γ needs to be as
large as possible.
To this end, we note that the spectrum of the unitary XZ† is spec(XZ†) = {−eπi(2j+1)/d|j ∈
Zd} ⊂C. The convex hull, S, of this spectrum is a regular d-gon inscribed in the unit
circle, and in the limit d →∞, S converges to the unit disk. For any point s ∈S, there is
a state |A0⟩such that ⟨A0| XZ† |A0⟩= s. This is because, decomposing |A0⟩into XZ†’s
eigenbasis, ⟨A0| XZ† |A0⟩yields the convex combinations of the eigenvalues. Therefore, for
any χ ≡e(Υ−1)∥α∥2 we can choose a |A0⟩such that
|Im(Γ)| = |Im[χ ⟨A0| XZ† |A0⟩]| ≥cos(π
d)|χ|.
(6.88)
Now assuming B is oﬀof A’s left-moving lightfront, the total work extracted by B, in terms
of both A and B’s spatial couplings, is given by
∆E = µ2

Z
R
dx(Fb(x))2−Im(Γ)λ0µ0

Z
R2dx dyFa(x)Fb(y)
(y−x+T)2 ,
(6.89)
where we used that λ(x) = λ0Fa(x), µ(x) = µ0Fb(x) as deﬁned above. There are two ways
to make the second term dominate: one can scale down µ0, as in conventional QET [33],
but this eventually decreases the amount of energy that can possibly be teleported. Let
us consider the remaining option, to scale up λ0. Since Γ depends on λ0 and d, we must
optimize the scaling of both variables.
124

6.2.4
Dimensions vs. Energy Scaling
Suppose A linearly increases the strength of her interaction in a spatially uniform manner
i.e., for θ ∈R+, λ0 7→θλ0, Fa(x) 7→Fa(x) (recall λ(x) ≡λ0Fa(x), λ0 ≡∥λ∥1), causing
∥α∥2 7→θ2∥α∥2. Meanwhile, suppose that A also superlinearly increases the dimensions
of the measurement probe d 7→⌈θ1+ϵ⌉d, for some ϵ > 0. Using the bound in (6.88), we
obtain
|Im(Γ)| ≥cos(

In the large θ limit, we have

(6.91)
Finally, from (6.89), we see that the extracted energy is then linearly increasing with the
scaling, ∆E ∼−θ. Note that a linear scaling of the dimensions (ϵ = 0) suﬃces, but in
that case |Im(Γ)| ⪆e−2π2∥α∥2/d2 as θ →∞.
We conclude from the above protocol that there so far seems to be no upper bound
to the total energy recoverable by B, independently of the shape or spread of his spatial
coupling. This is in contrast to the d = 2 case in previous descriptions of QET [33]. The
main limiting factor in the d = 2 case, where we have |χ| = e−2∥α∥2, is the exponential
decay with respect to the number expectation value ∥α∥2 =
R ∞

0. Our new
protocol circumvents this problem by countering the exponential decay via scaling of the
probe dimensions.
We further elaborate on this advantage over traditional UdW-type
detectors below.
6.2.5
Discussion
6.2.6
Asymptotic Locality
Flanagan’s quantum inequalities [20] establish a ﬁnite upper bound for any QET protocol
over the ﬁeld vacuum where A and B use strictly local operations [36].
However, the
protocol proposed in this paper may seem to overcome the limitations of such bound. The
reason for this is related to the degree of localization of A and B’s Hamiltonians (6.70) and
(6.79).
As mentioned previously, we will see in this section that A and B’s interaction Hamil-
tonians are not strictly local. This may seem problematic given that in order to be able to
draw the conclusion that all energy extracted by B has been teleported one would have to
125

assume that A and B only use strictly local operations. While indeed, generally not all of
the energy that B extracts will have been teleported, we will now show that in a suitable
scaling limit the interaction Hamiltonians become approximately local (to an arbitrary
degree) when the distance between A and B increases, while still allowing for limitless
quantum energy teleportation.
A ﬁrst way of characterizing the non-locality of our Hamiltonian is to express it in terms
of the ﬁeld operator and its canonical conjugate momentum. To do that we ﬁrst decompose
the qudit’s Weyl operators into Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts, let C = (X + X†)/2,
S = i(X −X†)/2, then we can rewrite (6.70) as
HA(x) = C
2 Π+(x)+ S
8π
Z
R
dy
 Φ+(y)
(x −y)2 + Π+(y)
(x −y)

.
(6.92)
We see that the anti-Hermitian component corresponds to a power-law decay smearing of
local observables. Notice that the non-local term vanishes in Hotta’s original QET protocol
[33] i.e., when d = 2 (the Hamiltonian is simply the usual Unruh-DeWitt Hamiltonian).
As a consequence, to label the proposed protocol as legitimate QET with such non-local
interaction, it is necessary that, as the distance between A and B increases, the non-local
contribution to the ﬁeld energy due to A’s ﬁeld interaction decays faster than the amount
of teleported energy retrieved by B from the ﬁeld. This would recover a clean QET protocol
in the asymptotic limit of large teleportation distances.
To study this, we must compute the energy density in the ﬁeld after by A’s interaction,
that is, EA(x) ≡⟨Ψ1| I ⊗ε+(x) |Ψ1⟩, giving
EA(x) = 1

Im ⟨X2⟩,
(6.93)
where ⟨X2⟩≡⟨A0| X2 |A0⟩. Notice that the second term causes the energy density to be
non-zero outside the support of A’s smearing. We can see that this is not the case for d = 2
where ⟨X2⟩= 1 and only the ﬁrst term of the above survives. However, for d > 2 the
second term gives a non-local contribution to the energy density. This is, A’s action puts
energy outside of her instantaneous support. While this may seem not reasonable from
the point of view of the causality of the interaction model [43], we note that the energy
126

that A deposits in the ﬁeld non-locally decays with the fourth power of the distance to A’s
support. This means that, in the large teleportation distance limit, the interaction model
becomes approximately causal with as much accuracy as desired. Most importantly, the
teleported energy (6.89) decays slower than this non-locality.
Indeed, comparing the second term of (6.93) to the second term of (6.89), we notice
that the non-locality of (6.93) scales as O(L−4) (where L is the spatial distance to the
support of λ, the spatial smearing of A’s coupling) while the teleportation term of (6.89)
scales as O(L−2). This means that for L suﬃciently large, we have O(L−2) ≫O(L−4),
i.e., our teleported energy outweighs the energy leaked by the non-locality of A’s action on
the ﬁeld. Therefore, we see that it is in principle possible to recover a proper QET scheme
in the asymptotic limit. To have a genuine energy teleportation scheme in this asymptotic
limit, we should be able to compensate for the distance decay of B’s ability to teleport
energy with an increase of A’s coupling strength, all while keeping the non-local term of
the interaction much smaller. From equations (6.89) and (6.93) (and appendix A.5) these
two conditions translate into
µ0
σB
≪λ0
L2 ≪1,
(6.94)
where σB is B’s detector smearing support lengthscale (the size of his detector). Note that
we assume d is suﬃciently large so that |Im(Γ)| ≈1 (discussed in 6.2.4) in the above.
These two conditions guarantee that we can do QET (the second summand of (6.89)
is larger in magnitude than the ﬁrst) and that the QET scheme is not due to non-locality
of the interaction Hamiltonian. We can now see whether we can scale our setup so that
unbounded QET is possible, if at least in the asymptotic limit. For this, we need the
second summand in (6.89) to be able to scale unboundedly as we scale the rest of the
parameters, being careful that at the same time the size of B’s detector, σB, scales slower
than the separation between detectors.
Note: the scaling relation, equations (6.95) to(6.98), was derived by Eduardo Martin-
Martinez.
For illustration, let us rescale the problem parameters so that all of them are expressed
in terms of the dimensionless rescaling parameter η so that L ∼η. If now λ0 ∼η2−ϵ,
µ0 ∼η2ϵ, σB ∼η4ϵ both inequalities can be expressed as
η−ϵ ≪1
(6.95)
which is true for any ϵ > 0 for large enough η. Now, for this particular choice of scaling
the teleported energy scales as
λ0µ0
L2
∼ηϵ
(6.96)
127

which means it can be made arbitrarily large increasing η. At the same time if we choose
0 < ϵ < 1/4 we get that
σB ∼η4ϵ < η
(6.97)
for large enough η, so, in other words, we can scale up the separation between the detectors
by a factor η if we scale up at the same time the coupling strengths of A and B by a factor
η2−ϵ and η2ϵ respectively while at the same time scaling the width of B’s detector σB as
η4ϵ. For the separation between the detectors to scale up faster than the length of detector
B we need to demand that ϵ < 1/4. As a result, the teleported energy scales as ηϵ which
in the asymptotic limit where locality is recovered exactly, η →∞, is unbounded.
Note that in the above analysis, we would also need to scale up the dimensions d of
the probe at least as fast as the scaling of λ0 to get a value of Γ →1, as was discussed in
section 6.2.4. To be sure that this factor does not aﬀect the above analysis, we require the
scaling d ∼η2 > η2−ϵ ∼λ0, hence for suﬃciently large η, we have |Im(Γ)| ≈1.
Notice that, in this asymptotic limit, one can teleport an arbitrarily large amount energy
from A to B. Since the initial ﬁeld state was the vacuum, this implies that, asymptotically,
B deposits an arbitrary large amount of negative energy in the ﬁeld in and near his spatial
support. However, the density of this negative energy does in fact scale down as we scale
up the teleported energy, namely
λ0µ0
L2σB
∼η−3ϵ.
(6.98)
Indeed, if the initial ﬁeld state is the vacuum, in the asymptotic regime where the QET
protocol becomes local (i.e., where the non-localities of the interaction are suﬃciently
suppressed), it is still not possible to deposit an arbitrarily negative energy density in the
ﬁeld, as expected from Flanagan’s quantum inequality [20]. This shows that teleporting
arbitrarily large amounts of energy through QET is compatible with Flanagan’s theorem
in a suitable asymptotic regime.
For completeness, we can calculate the energy density after B’s interaction. B’s state
after his interaction is given by,
|Ψ3⟩=
X
ij
⟨zi|xj⟩⟨xj|A0⟩|zi⟩D(ξi) |Λj⟩
(6.99)

The ﬁrst two terms of (6.100) give us A’s energy density, translated to the left by T. The
third and fourth terms are B’s investment in the ﬁeld from switching his detector, similar
to A’s. The ﬁfth and sixth terms are the interesting ones since they can create negative
energy densities.
The sixth term is our teleportation term from our usual calculation,
before being spatially integrated. The ﬁfth term is similar to our teleportation term. In
the appropriate scaling limit (discussed above), the last two terms will dominate in the
vicinity of B’s support, creating a locally negative energy density in the ﬁeld.
6.2.7
Information Theoretic Considerations
Information Redundancy
We have shown that by scaling up the amount of information exchanged between A and
B along with the amount of energy injected in the ﬁeld it is possible to obtain arbitrarily
large teleported energies.
One might wonder what would happen if we leave A’s coupling strength ﬁxed (and the
smearing) while scaling up the dimensions, i.e. keep λ(x) ﬁxed while increasing d. Our
bound for the teleportation term’s coeﬃcient (6.88) becomes
|Im(Γ)| ≥cos(π
d)e


∥α∥2 d→∞

(6.106)
We see that simply increasing the dimensions has diminishing returns.
As d ≫∥α∥,
adding more dimensions to our probe does not yield much of an advantage in terms of
129

energy extracted.
In other words, increasing the number of potential outcomes of our
measurement does not necessarily mean that it will yield more information about the ﬁeld
state that is useful for QET.
Although an increase in the dimensions of the probe without a corresponding increase
in coupling strength has a diminishing advantage in terms of energy teleported, it can still
be useful to consider higher dimensions for a given ﬁxed coupling strength to counter the
eﬀects of noise in the communication channel. Say that the quantum channel between A
and B were to have quantum noise in the form of Weyl operators, i.e., with a probability
p(a, b), ZaXb is applied onto the qudit in (6.77), then on average our teleportation term
in (6.81) would pick up a factor of P
a,b∈Zd p(a, b) cos(2πb/d). If most errors have b ≪d,
then we are still capable of fairly eﬃcient QET. The analogous statement for the classical
communication scenario would be that the new QET protocol can withstand noise as long
as it only causes small shifts relative to the size of the alphabet. This fault tolerance further
highlights that increasing the dimensions of the probe without scaling other parameters
causes our measurement information to increase its ’redundancy’ (in the sense of error
correction).
Information Harvesting
A possible explanation for this redundancy would be that since A’s energy injected into
the ﬁeld is related to the amount of entanglement acquired between her probe and the
ﬁeld by her measurement, keeping that energy ﬁxed imposes a bound to the amount of
probe-ﬁeld entanglement that can be achieved by the probe-ﬁeld interaction. Increasing the
dimensions of the probe would then simply allow for the approach to that bound. Below
we provide some mathematical and geometrical intuition to support the above explanation.
Looking at equation (6.75), we see that the probe and the ﬁeld are nearly in a Schmidt
decomposition; if the {|ζj⟩= |e2πij/dα⟩: j ∈Zd} were orthogonal, then the probe would be
maximally entangled with the ﬁeld. Note that these coherent states are the ones superposed
in ﬁgure 6.1. Note that the inner product between any two of these states is ⟨ζm|ζk⟩=
e(e2πi(m−k)/d−1)∥α∥2. The smaller these inner products are, the closer to maximally entangled
the probe is. These inner products increase when increasing d or decreasing ∥α∥2. This
supports our intuition that a more entanglement requires greater energy injected and that
increasing the dimensions while keeping the energy ﬁxed only worsens the sub-maximality
of the entanglement.
Geometrically, looking at ﬁgure 6.1, since each coherent state has a ﬁxed variance in
phase space (saturating Heisenberg uncertainty), then a limited number of coherent states
130

can be resolved for a ﬁxed radius when these are placed at the vertices of a regular d-gon
(of said radius). As manifested in (6.75), the probe’s state is perfectly correlated with each
coherent state, hence these need to be well discernible in order for measurements of the
probe to transitively give us accurate knowledge of the ﬁeld’s phase. To ﬁt more minimally
overlapping coherent states, the radius (|α|, analogous to ∥α∥) needs to be increased. If we
were to increase the radius, we would intuitively expect the maximum number of minimally
overlapping coherent states to scale as the perimeter of a circle, hence linearly in the radius.
We thus have geometrically justiﬁed our linear scaling result in (6.91).
6.2.8
Energy Conditions
Flanagan’s theorem [20] sets limits to the amount of energy that can be teleported by a
local QET protocol. In our protocol we overcome the limitation imposed by the theorem
by allowing for a non-local interaction between the ﬁeld and A and B’s probes. In the
asymptotic limit where A and B are far apart and the support of B is scaled up, the non-
locality contribution to the energy extracted by B becomes arbitrarily small as compared
to the teleported energy.
As discussed above, we calculated that the ﬁeld admits a locally negative energy density
near B, i.e., averaged over B’s locale, supp(µ), we have ⟨: T++ :⟩< 0. Although this is
locally a violation of the pointwise Null Energy Condition (NEC) [26], which is not uncom-
mon for quantum ﬁelds, the Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC) [39] (integrated over
a complete light sheet) is respected. This is because the energy recovered by B is less than
or equal to A’s measurement energy investment, ∆E ≤EA. In terms of bounds related
to the spatial proﬁle, QET obeys Ford’s quantum inequalities [21]. A bound potentially
relevant to our new protocol is the Quantum Null Energy Condition [11], since it provides
a pointwise lower bound for the stress energy tensor which is related to the entanglement
entropy of the ﬁeld.
It would be interesting to verify if this bound can be saturated via the new qudit-QET
approach.
6.2.9
Conclusions
We have shown that two distant agents A and B equipped with qudit probes which interact
with a massless scalar ﬁeld on a compactly supported region of space, can teleport an
arbitrary amount of energy from one to another in a suitable asymptotic regime, without
any energy ﬂowing from A to B, and by means of only localized operations on the ﬁeld and
131

classical or quantum communication. The scaling up of the amount of teleported energy
is achieved by scaling protocol parameters, and in particular by scaling up the amount of
information about the ﬁeld obtained by A and sent to B.
Remarkably, in order for A to be able to harvest increasingly more information from the
ﬁeld that is useful to teleport an arbitrarily large amount of energy, it is not suﬃcient to
simply increase the dimension of the usual Unruh-DeWitt detector keeping the interaction
local, as this would contradict Flanagan’s theorem. Instead, we overcome this limitation
by introducing a weak non-locality in the interaction Hamiltonian. The non-locality is
such that a) it allows us to circumvent the constraints of Flanagan’s quantum inequality,
and b) it is such it becomes negligible in a suitable asymptotic regime.
Our results are of interest not only in this asymptotic regime. There are setups where
non-localities in the interaction Hamiltonian appear naturally. An obvious example is solid-
state physics where the speed of sound can be much smaller than the speed of light, which
implies that there can be interactions with eﬀective non-localities similar to (6.70) and
(6.78). Additionally, Hamiltonians with exactly the same degree of non-locality appear
in quantum-optical setups whenever the rotating-wave approximation is used [43]. Our
results may therefore be useful in the context of quantum information processing. Another
scenario where non-locality is expected to appear is Planck-scale physics.
For experimental realizations, our modiﬁed protocol for QET requires qudit systems.
Qudits have various experimental realizations, e.g., in quantum optics, often involving the
orbital angular momentum states of photons [47, 53, 50]. There have also been theoretical
proposals for quantum error corrected realizations of stable qudits and their logical Weyl
operators, either using a stabilizer subspace of harmonic oscillator states [25], or using a
topological quantum memory employing abelian anyons [73].

Ongoing & Future Work
This chapter contains ideas in various stages of development which could be seen as po-
tential extensions to the work presented in this thesis. Some of the content discussed in
this chapter relies on concepts not covered by the background sections of this thesis, e.g.,
the basics of QFT in curved spacetime. If need be, please refer to standard references on
the topic: [10, 48].
7.1
Optimal Measurement of a Quantum Field
This section features ongoing work, we will explore the underlying motivation and some
prototypical calculations.
7.1.1
Compressed Sampling Information
In our analysis of QET, we have seen that a good measurement for QET breaks ground
state entanglement, the more broken entanglement, the better. One may then wonder
what would an optimal measurement for QET be? As we have constructed in this thesis,
there are ways to probe subspaces of locally smeared observables of the ﬁeld. In a certain
limit, one may consider what happens when one measures “all of the information” available
in a certain region of space which tells us about its complement. In other words, say we
consider a region of space, call it A, then some of information in A is correlated with
degrees of freedom contained in A, while some information in A tells us about the state
on ¯A, the complement (outside of A). Intuitively, one may think that measuring the ﬁeld
133

everywhere1 in A would yield all of the information in A. Although that may be the case,
because information about the ﬁeld amplitude at a certain point tells us mostly about the
ﬁeld conﬁguration at neighboring points (correlations fall oﬀquickly with distance), then
sampling a set of points (or sharply smeared ﬁeld observables) that lie in A yields a lot
of redundant information. In this thesis, more speciﬁcally in our exploration of QET, we
saw how to harness the information of a multi-point measurement eﬃciently to infer the
ﬁeld conﬁguration at each energy extraction target point. We achieved this by having Bob
receive all the “raw” information from Alice’s measurements, then optimizing the couplings
in order to ﬁlter out intra correlations in Alice’s sampled values. In other words, there is a
potential for this information to be compressed, and instead of ﬁltering out the noise as a
post-processing operation, what if we could measure directly a “compressed observable”?
That is, what if there were a local observable at A (or a set of observables) for which
knowledge of the eigenvalue of this observable would tell us all of the available information
about ¯A that is in A (and only that)? We will now see how we can construct such an
observable.
7.1.2
Schmidt Basis Measurement
Maximal Entanglement Breaking
We are looking for observable(s) in A for which knowledge of its eigenvalue(s) could contain
all of the information in A which is mutual with ¯A. If we consider the ground state of a
quantum ﬁeld |0⟩as our state on A ∪¯A, then we know it is a pure state. Hence, globally,
there is no uncertainty in the state, but locally, say we restrict ourselves to A, by the
nature of entanglement, the state restricted to A, ρA = tr ¯
A(|0⟩⟨0|), has some nonzero Von
Neumann entropy, equal to the entanglement entropy. As a rough mathematical sketch,
we have the Schmidt decomposition2:
|0⟩=
X
j
√pj |ψj⟩A | ¯ψj⟩¯
A ,
ρA =
X
j
pj |ψj⟩⟨ψj|A ,
S(A)ρ =
X
j
−pj log(pj).
(7.1)
The observable whose probability distribution of measurement outcomes has the Shan-
non entropy equal to that of the Von Neumann entropy of ρA is the observable which
1or, given a UV cutoﬀ, according to sharp localized smearings (e.g.
sinc-like functions which are
essentially like a delta measure with a UV cutoﬀ) such that the density of samplings is greater than the
Nyquist rate (at least a sample point per half cutoﬀwavelength) [58].
2We will give the proper Schmidt decomposition of the ground state later on in this section.

shares the same eigenbasis as ρA, as we know simply from the way we deﬁne the Von Neu-
mann entropy. In other words, using our notation from the above equation, the Schmidt
basis vectors for A must be the eigenvectors of the observable of interest; for example, an
observable
OA ≡
X
j
λj |ψj⟩⟨ψj|A
(7.2)
where the index j runs over the whole spectrum of ρA and the λj are distinct. Notice that
if we performed a type of phase estimation algorithm on such an observable, say UA is
the entangling unitary between A and some control/probe system C, then the probe-ﬁeld
state would get transformed as
UA :
X
j
√pj |ψj⟩A | ¯ψj⟩¯
A |0⟩C 7→
X
j
√pj |ψj⟩A | ¯ψj⟩¯
A |j⟩C .
(7.3)
We see that the bipartite entanglement between A and ¯A has been converted to tripartite
GHZ-like A ¯AC tripartite entanglement.
Let us denote the state of the ﬁeld after this
probe-ﬁeld interaction as |Ψ1⟩≡UA |0⟩A ¯
A |0⟩C, then if we trace out the probe system (C),
we get the state
˜ρA ¯
A ≡trC(|Ψ1⟩⟨Ψ1|) =
X
j
pj |ψj⟩⟨ψj|A ⊗| ¯ψj⟩⟨¯ψj| ¯
A
(7.4)
which we can recognize as a separable state with only classical correlations left between A
and ¯A. In other words, the measurement process broke all of the entanglement between A
and ¯A. As we saw in our analysis of QET, it seems that a greater amount of entanglement
breaking at the point of measurement is a sign that more information about the ﬁeld
has been collected. In the above Schmidt picture, the advantage of such a measurement
is made clear; mutual information between A and ¯A comes from bipartite entanglement,
measuring A in the Schmidt basis for this bipartition yields a probe which has as much
mutual information with A as it has with ¯A;
I(A; C)Ψ1 = I( ¯A; C)Ψ1 = S(A) = S( ¯A) = S(C) = S(A ¯A).
(7.5)
Hence, a measurement in the Schmidt basis does yield what we were aiming at: a mea-
surement of A which yields information that is strictly that which is mutual with ¯A.

7.1.3
Modular Hamiltonian
Now, the question is, what is an observable which shares the same eigenbasis as the reduced
density matrix on A? Well, suppose we have an operator K such that
ρA ∼e−K
(7.6)
then K would have the same eigenbasis as ρA, as an operator and its (real) exponential
share the same eigenspace. It turns out, there exists such an operator, which is called the
modular Hamiltonian.
In certain Quantum Field Theories, e.g., CFT’s (conformal ﬁeld theories;, massless
scalar ﬁeld theories are an example), the modular Hamiltonian is in fact a local operator
[37]. Thus the modular Hamiltonian in such theories could be considered as a local ob-
servable. The reduced density matrix for the state of the ﬁeld on a certain region A can
then be written as
ρA = 1
Z e−βK,
Z ≡tr(ρA)
(7.7)
where K is the modular Hamiltonian, and by convention, we can3 set β = 2π. The modular
Hamiltonian is often used in calculations of entanglement entropy, as it is linearly related
to the logarithm of the reduced density matrix, log ρA = −βK −log Z, which pops up in
the expression for the von Neumann entropy:
S(A)ρ = −tr(ρ log ρ) = tr (ρ(βK + log Z)) = β ⟨K⟩ρ + Z log Z.
(7.8)
Modular Hamiltonian Flow
An alternative way of computing the entropy is the replica trick,
−lim
n→1
log(tr(ρn))
n −1

n→1
log(tr(en log ρ))
n −1

ϵ
= −lim
ϵ→0

: 0
log(1) + ϵtr(ρ log ρ))
ϵ
= −tr(ρ log(ρ)) = S(ρ)
(7.9)
3The reason for this convention will be discussed shortly, it is related to the fact that the modular
Hamiltonian generates a rotational(-like) ﬂow in the Euclidean plane (imaginary time) picture. In this
picture the modular Hamiltonian is like angular momentum, and since a circular ﬂow has a 2π periodicity,
we can absorb this factor into the β.
136

which is roughly related to the rate of change of the partition function of ρn at n = 1, as
one can rewrite
−lim
n→1
log(tr(ρn))
n −1
= [∂n log(tr(ρn))]n=1.
(7.10)
In some sense this is related to how much the partition function changes as we multiply
“copies” of ρ together. One could argue that log ρ is the “generator of copies” of ρ (as
en log ρ = ρn). As the modular Hamiltonian is linearly related to the logarithm of the den-
sity matrix, then we can consider it to be a generator of copies of the state.
To use the replica trick in quantum ﬁeld theory, one usually employs the Wick-rotated
path integral picture, as we have brieﬂy covered in our QFT background chapter. In the
path integral picture, to compute the partition function [41] for ρn, one makes a “cut”
along region A, so as to create the state ρA = tr ¯
A(|0⟩⟨0|). We will consider A to be a
ball of a certain radius l on a spacelike surface, hence in the traditional 2D sketches of the
Euclidean plane, region A is an interval. To have multiple copies of ρA, one takes mul-
tiples Euclidean plane path integrals with cuts on A and “joins” the cuts by connecting
them in a cyclical fashion, joining the “out” edge to the “in” edge of the next one, and
connecting the last one back to the ﬁrst one. These connections are supposed to mimic the
contraction of operators ρA · ρA · ... and the last contraction gives us a trace, hence tr(ρn
A).
The resulting multi-sheeted surface is called a Riemann surface, it is a bit like a “double”
spiral staircase, which winds clockwise for one pole (edge of a cut) and counter-clockwise
for the other. To go along this staircase, one ﬂows along these spirals, hence by following
a rotation about the poles. There is a resulting vector ﬁeld of “ﬂow” down this “staircase”
(as another analogy: it looks like the magnetic ﬁeld lines wrapping around a loop current).
This ﬂow is the one which, in some sense, generates more copies of ρA, more particularly,
it brings change to tr(ρn
A), hence we can use it for replica trick.
Thus the ﬂow of the modular Hamiltonian in the Euclidean path integral picture is
that of a vector ﬁeld which “wraps around” the poles of a cut, hence it wraps around the
boundary of the region A. As rotations preserve their center of rotation, then the ﬂow of
the modular Hamiltonian for the reduced density operator on a region A should preserve
the boundary of that region, ∂A. The case where the region A is half of the real line (in-
stead of an interval) is a well-known case, in this case the only boundary is a point (which
we can assume to be the origin), the modular ﬂow is then the vector ﬁeld of rotations about
the origins, that is, the modular Hamiltonian is proportional to the angular momentum
operator for rotations about the origin [66]. As a copy of ρA is given by adding a full
rotation (2π) according to the angular momentum, which is the modular Hamiltonian K,
137

then we get an exponential ρA ∼e−2πK. Going back to the real time picture, a rotation in
imaginary time (Wick rotated) corresponds to a boost in real time (Lorentzian picture).
Thus, by analytically continuing this vector ﬁeld from imaginary time to real time, the
modular Hamiltonian ﬂow goes from a rotation about the origin to a boost4. This is the a
way to recover the well-known Unruh eﬀect. The thermal character of the density matrix
arises from periodicity in imaginary time, as prescribed by the KMS condition [10].
In the Unruh eﬀect, according to a Rindler observer, that is, an observer whose time
coordinate corresponds to that of the modular Hamiltonian of the half line, then the ﬁeld
looks locally like a thermal state. As we explained above, since the modular Hamiltonian
in imaginary time was a rotation, in real time it is a boost. For an observer to travel to
have his time coordinate be that of a boost, the observer has to be uniformly accelerated.
Thus, a uniformly accelerated observer with a constant acceleration sees a thermal state
of the ﬁeld. For an acceleration a = 1, because of the periodicity of 2π in imaginary time,
the inverse temperature is β = 1/T = 2π. If the observer accelerates with a ̸= 1, then the
boost operator picks up a factors a, and to get back the modular Hamiltonian one needs
to divide by a; e−2πK = e−2π
a (aK) hence the temperature becomes T = a/2π. Without loss
of generality we can then set the acceleration to 1.
Now, going back to the modular Hamiltonian for a ball-shaped region (ﬁnite radial
interval), then the modular Hamiltonian ﬂow in imaginary time is essentially a rotational
ﬂow about the boundary poles. As one gets close to the boundary it is very much like a
rotation, but as one looks further away from one edge of the boundary, since the ﬂow has
to preserve the whole boundary, the vector ﬁeld is not quite just a rotation. Going back
to real time, in the regions where the modular ﬂow in imaginary time was like a rotation,
the modular ﬂow should have a boost-like character. We will now explore how one would,
operationally, observe the “Unruh eﬀect” associated to this modular Hamiltonian ﬂow.
4For pictorial intuition for 1+1 dimensions, one can imagine a one-sheeted hyperboloid, with the radial
dimensions being space/imaginary time, and real time being the axis of (cylindrical) symmetry. One can
think of full rotations as curves wrapping around the waist of the one-sheeted hyperboloid and boosts
travelling orthogonally, hence along a hyperbolic path.

7.1.4
Modular Modes
Unruh eﬀect and Modular Hamiltonian eigenbasis
Rindler observers naturally couple to Rindler modes, hence “measurement” in their de-
fault basis is the Rindler mode basis. A uniformly accelerated detector that is switched
on eternally with a certain gap will then couple to a speciﬁc Rindler mode. Instead of
coupling to natural Rindler modes temporally, one could consider a Minkowski observer
which couples spatially to certain smeared observables, similarly to what has been treated
in this thesis. Instead of measuring the Fock state of a Minkowski mode by measuring the
particle number in each Fourier mode, one could measure the Fock state for a diﬀerent
choice of modes, e.g. Rindler modes.
For example, a right Rindler wedge left moving mode function of Rindler frequency ω
looks like the following with respect to Minkowski coordinates [16]:
gω(V ) = Θ(V )
4πω e−iω
a log(aV )
(7.11)
where V = x + t, Θ(V ) is the Heaviside step function. There are similar modes {¯gω}ω
for the left-moving left Rindler wedge, deﬁned for V < 0, as well as for the right-moving
modes. Hence to measure, say the Φω for this mode, one measures
Φω =
Z
R+ dx
 gω(x)aω + g∗
ω(x)a†
ω

.
(7.12)
Where the Rindler ladder operators are related to the Minkowski operators by a well-known
Bogolyubov transformation. To get this transformation, we expand the Rindler modes in
terms of Minkowski modes:
θ(V )gω(V ) =
Z ∞
0
dk
 αR
ωkfk(V ) + βR
ωkf ∗
k(V )

(7.13)
θ(−V )¯gω(V ) =
Z ∞
0
dk
 αL
ωkfk(V ) + βL
ωkf ∗
k(V )

(7.14)
We can then compute Bogolyubov coeﬃcients by integrating the above over V from
these equations
αR
ωk = ieπω/2a
2π
√
ωk
a
k
−iω/a
Γ(1 −iω/a)
(7.15)
as for the other coeﬃcients, we get
αR
ωk = αL∗
ωk = −eπω/aβR
ωk = −eπω/aβL∗
ωk.
(7.16)
139

Our Bogolyubov transformation for Rindler operators in terms of Minkowski operators
is then given by
ˆbR
+ω =

.
(7.18)
Thus, we could imagine measuring the ˆbL†
+ωˆbL
+ω operator for example, on the left Rindler
wedge. The problem with Rindler modes is that their eigenfunctions are supported on a
noncompact region, i.e. on the half-line. Nevertheless, one could imagine performing a
measurement in the Rindler basis by entangling some probe system with a Rindler mode,
or, ideally, a probe for each Rindler mode. Since the Rindler Fock basis is the Schmidt
basis for the ﬁeld, such a measurement would break all of the entanglement between the
left and right Rindler wedges

(7.19)
Thus, measuring the Rindler Fock state in the right Rindler wedge would tell us everything
one could know about the left Rindler wedge from the right Rindler wedge. Note that this
was achieved by measurement in the eigenbasis of the modular Hamiltonian, which in this
case was the generator of boosts which preserves the origin in imaginary time, which turns
out to be the time coordinate for the Rindler observer.
Now that we have intuition from the Rindler case, we can move on to the case for
a ball-shaped region. In a recent paper, Jacobson [37] constructs a time-like vector ﬁeld
corresponding to the ﬂow generated by the modular Hamiltonian of a ball-shaped region
of geodesic radius l. As we will cover below (see equation (7.24)), this ﬁeld does have a
boost-like character. It is a vector ﬁeld which preserves the causal diamond of the ball
region, one can consider this to be essentially like a time coordinate for the interior of the
diamond.
Now, in analogy to the Rindler case, we can imagine extending the coordinate transfor-
mation deﬁned by Jacobson’s timelike Killing vector ﬁeld in [37]. We could then ﬁnd the
140

set of eigenmodes which is natural to these coordinates, as one does for the Rindler coor-
dinates. This new set of mode functions will be related to the Minkowski mode functions
by a certain Bogolyubov transformation, which we could compute.
Now, unlike traditional analyses of detectors coupling to Rindler modes via acceleration,
the time-like coordinate associated with the modular Hamiltonian would be unphysical (one
would need to achieve the speed of light in a ﬁnite time), the traditional Unruh-deWitt
model would not necessarily be ideal to probe these modes. Instead, we would probe the
a spatially smeared observable corresponding to the Fock basis for each “modular mode”
(what we will call the eigenmodes of the modular Hamitonian).
Modular Modes
As the reduced density matrix on A, as argued by Jacobson, is given by a thermal density
matrix according to the Modular Hamiltonian, then, just like in the usual Unruh eﬀect,
according to the modular Fock basis, we should get the ground state being entangled
similarly to the Rindler case:
|0⟩F =
O
ν
 
1
√
Zν
∞
X
nν=0
e−πnνi |nν⟩A |nν⟩¯

(7.20)
and so we want to ﬁnd the modes for which the associated ladder operators cν, c†
ν are such
that
ρA =
O

Zν
∞
X
nν=0
e−2πnν |nν⟩⟨nν|A

=
O
ν
e−2πc†
νcν
Zν
.
(7.21)
The modular modes are then, in a sense, the functional Schmidt basis; the basis of mode
functions for the Schmidt decomposition. Thus, as was argued above, measuring the ﬁeld
in this eigenbasis would yield all the information contained in a region A which is mutual
with its complement ¯A.
Now, let us ﬁnd these modes using Jacobson’s [37] vector ﬁeld. Let the metric be
ds2 = −dt2 + dr2 + r2dΩ2 = −dudv + r2dΩ2
(7.22)
where
u = t −r,
v = t + r.
(7.23)
141

Jacobson deﬁnes the timelike Killing vector ﬁeld deﬁned in the causal diamond of a space-
like ball of radius l,
ζ ≡1

2l

(l2 −r2 −t2)∂t −2rt∂r

.
(7.24)
Let us construct a time coordinate such that this killing vector ﬁeld is the time derivative
vector ﬁeld, i.e. let us ﬁnd τ such that ∂τ = ζ. We will also construct a spatial coordinate,
ρ to go with τ. We will be doing our analysis in 1+1 dimensions for convenience5 Consider
the following change of coordinates:
τ ≡2 arctanh

2l(l2 −u2)∂u + 1
2l(l2 −v2)∂v = η
(7.26)
we do eﬀectively have ζ = ∂τ.
Let us deﬁne the lightlike coordinates associated with
U ≡τ + ρ,
V = τ −ρ,
(7.27)
we can express these in terms of the regular lightlike coordinates
U = 4 arctanh

(7.29)
We see that we have a conformal transformation; since U is strictly a function of u and V
of v, the left and right-moving lightlike coordinates are not mixed. In 1+1 dimensions, we
5I go from radial n + 1 to 1 + 1 dimensions by (sloppily) swapping the radial coordinates to a cartesian
spatial coordinate. I still think this should work (as the important part is for the change of coordinates to
preserve the dudv term in the metric), but I will be more care careful in the full calculation.
142

can easily write the mode functions associated to this change of coordinates (i.e. solving
the K-G equation in the new lightlike coordinates), we get
gν(V ) =

(7.31)
What we see is that there is eﬀectively a “double chirp” in the modes, very much like
the case for Rindler modes. In fact, up to normalization, the modular modes (above) of
a certain frequency are equal to the product of Rindler modes of that frequency for the
Rindler horizon at the boundaries of the causal diamond, i.e. in our case v = ±l. For
visualisation, we can plot the real part of a modular mode for t = 0 and x ∈[−l, l].

Figure 7.1: Example of Re(gν(x)) for ν = 5, the real part of a modular mode on the t = 0
slice. The horizontal axis is in units of l. We clearly see there is divergent chirping at the
horizons.
The divergence of the frequency of the modes can be explained the same way as in the
Rindler case. For hyperbolic Rindler trajectories getting close to the origin, an observer
143

travelling along this trajectory needs to be accelerated faster to maintain the same horizon
as other trajectories which are further out. As for the modular modes, the causal diamond
has horizons emanating from the boundary, hence any trajectory that gets close to the
boundary will be highly accelerated, thus there is a blueshift; a chirp.
Note that we have yet to compute the Bogolyubov coeﬃcients for the Bogolyubov
transformation relating the Minkowski modes to the modular modes. Additionally, we
need to construct the dual modes, i.e. the modes for ¯A that are one-to-one entangled with
the modular modes of A we have constructed. Once this is done, we should be able to
replicate the derivation of the Unruh eﬀect [16] to recover the squeezed state form as we
conjectured in equation (7.20). To compute the Bogolyubov transformation, we start with
the ansatz
Θ(V )gν(v) =
Z ∞
0
dk
 αA
ωkfk(V ) + βA
ωkf ∗
k(V )

(7.32)
where the fk are Minkowski modes. Using the orthonormality of Minkowski modes, taking
the inner product with a single-freqency Minkowski mode, then integrating over V , we
should be able to compute the coeﬃcients. As the modular modes are proportional to a
product of Rindler modes, we can use the Unruh eﬀect results and the convolution theorem.
Although this calculation should be straightforward, I have yet to complete it, hence why
this section is considered ongoing work.
7.1.5
Energetics & Firewalls
Cutoﬀs
Suppose we are given an operational UV cutoﬀ, i.e. suppose no detector can couple to
a smeared operator whose smearing has Fourier components above a certain (Minkowski)
frequency. Since the modular modes have inﬁnite chirp near the boundary, if we bandlimit
the modular modes’ Minkowski frequencies, this will eﬀectively leave a “buﬀer” region
near the boundary where the chirped frequency exceeds the cutoﬀand the detectors do
not couple to the modes in this region.
This is akin to entanglement entropy calculations in QFT where a buﬀer region is
traced out between the region of interest (for which we want to compute the entropy)
and its complement is used to add a UV cutoﬀ. If we do indeed add a UV cutoﬀ, the
amount of information we can gather is ﬁnite, as we are considering a compact region with
a UV cutoﬀ, hence there should exist a ﬁnite basis of functions which span this subspace
of bandlimited modular modes.
144

Another way to possibly instill a UV cutoﬀis by cutting oﬀthe modular mode fre-
quency rather than Minkowski frequency. It is unclear if we get a ﬁnite set of functional
basis elements in this case as technically the index of the modular modes is continuous,
hence a UV cutoﬀof that index would not necessarily make this set of modes ﬁnite.
In any case, the intricacies of how to add cutoﬀto this measurement of modes should be
of importance for our understanding of how cutoﬀs can regularize entanglement entropies,
a topic of great interest [58].
Energetics
Once we have computed the Bogolyubov transformation and ﬁgured out a way to imple-
ment a UV cutoﬀ, we can consider computing the change in energy caused by the mea-
surement process. Indeed, measuring the modular modes’ Fock number operators should
break the entanglement between A and ¯A, and as the injection of energy due to entangle-
ment breaking via measurement has been of interest in this thesis, it should be interesting
to see how much energy is injected in this extreme limit. That is, if we break all of the
entanglement of a region A with its complement via our above measurement scheme (as in
(7.19)), then how much energy is injected into the ﬁeld?
The energetics of broken entanglement have made an appearance in the recent literature
on black holes [5]. In these papers, some argue that the horizon of the black hole breaks all
entanglement of the interior of the black hole with its exterior, and the energetic imprint
of this creates what is known as a ﬁrewall. Indeed, if we did the same scheme as in (7.19)
but for the entangled state in, (7.20), then, tracing out the probe systems, the resulting
state of the ﬁeld is
˜ρA ¯
A =

nν=0
e−πnνi |nν⟩⟨nν|A ⊗|nν⟩⟨nν| ¯

(7.33)
which is a correlated but disentangled state. This is not quite the state ρA ⊗ρ ¯
A, which
would be more akin to what some have considered as the “ﬁrewall state” for black holes
[44].
In any case, calculating the change in energy density in the ﬁeld caused by this
measurement could be insightful as to the nature of ﬁrewalls.
145

7.2
Other Ideas
7.2.1
Maximal QET
We could possibly consider using the optimal measurement procedure described above to
test the limits of negative energy densities, by combining the modular modes measurement
with QET.
Given all of the information about a certain compact region A by measurign its com-
plement, ¯A, then with an optimal choice of controlled unitary, we could possibly punch a
strongly negative energy hole in spacetime.
Otherwise, we could try to use the modular mode measurement for normal QET, i.e.
measure observables in a compact region A, target another compact region B ̸= ¯A. Note
that we would probably have to let go of our restriction to Gaussian operations.
7.2.2
QET for General Gaussian States
Much of the calculations presented in this thesis relied on the Gaussian state formalism,
which we introduced in our Quantum Information Basics background section. For the
calculations completed in this thesis, we mostly used the ground state of either a chain
of harmonic oscillators or the ground state of the vacuum in Quantum Field Theory, also
known as the Minkowski vaccum. Without the need for too much additional work, one
could extend our calculations to encompass scenarios where the initial state of the system
is a general Gaussian state, i.e. other than the vacuum state.
As squeezed states are Gaussian states, and our formalism for QFT and for lattices,
when computing changes in energies in the ﬁeld/lattice due to linear coupling with a probe
all yielded gives us expectation values of correlators and ﬁrst moments, then all we have
to do is compute the Green’s functions and moments of the squeezed states and we have
QET for squeezed states.
In our chapter on QET with a linear Harmonic lattice, we considered ground states of
lattices of the form
H = 1
2
X
i,j∈L
(π2
j + φiKijφj)
(7.34)
hence our calculations are valid for any lattice of that form. The ground states of lattices
of this form can be considered as squeezed states with respect to the quantization in other
146

lattices. For example, if K is a nearest neighbor coupling like we had in (4.3), then the
ground state of this chain is a squeezed state, that is, each harmonic oscillator is squeezed
with another to varying degree. As an aside, in 4.2.1 we worked out the various squeezings
between oscillators of this ground state. In general, the changes in the Hamiltonian can
be any polynomial of second order of the quadratures. The resulting ground state will be
a squeezed state, but without too much more work our approach could be adapted to such
cases.
Also note that since thermal states are also Gaussian, we could compute the changes
in energy due to QET.
An interesting application of this would be to recalculate Hotta’s Controlled Hawking
Process [33] for the Hartle-Hawking vaccuum (thermal) or the Boulware vacuum (sqeezed
state).
7.2.3
Sampling Fields for Quantum Computation
It is well known that preparing the ground state for a quantum simulation is computa-
tionally hard. Using the quantum analog-to-digital converter discussed in this thesis, one
could imagine preparing a near-vacuum state in a lab and “scanning” it using the multipoint
QADC. That is, instead of simulating the adiabatic state preparation of a ground/thermal
state on the quantum computer, one prepares a system in the lab and harvests the state
structure and digitalizes a subspace of the quantum ﬁeld.

Conclusion
In this work, we analyzed how probing quantum ﬁelds can be used for multiple diﬀerent
endeavours, such as quantum energy teleportation, entanglement harvesting, measurement,
and entanglement breaking. We studied both the energetics and the information theoretics
of each scenario, and successfully built novel protocols for each case, by building upon
our accumulated knowledge of recurrent concepts. Thus, by exploring multiple areas of
relativistic quantum information in parallel, we reaped the rewards for our eﬀorts in linking
diﬀerent topics.
And thus concludes this thesis. Thanks for reading.

Now, the expression we obtained here is somewhat unwieldy. The above term is associated
to the switching costs for Bob to couple to the ﬁeld.

We will perform this integral in three parts once again. We deﬁne IIIq, IIIp and IIIx to
be the integrals over q, p and x respectively. We will separate the integral in three parts
and integrate in that order. We rewrite III in terms of IIIq, IIIp, IIIx as follows:

We tackle the ﬁrst integral, IIIq by gathering the linear and quadratic terms and deﬁning
the vector and matrix:

To help ourselves in our calculation, we divide the diﬀerent terms in order to better conquer
them. We have the “symmetric” and the “cross” terms (I and II respectively). Keep in

We see that these terms yield the independent energy of the coherent states generated by
A and B’s interactions. This would be the energy in the ﬁeld if A and B would both do
163

their interactions without being causally related. The interesting behaviour of QET hence
lies in the cross terms. Indeed, the work extracted (the negative energy) will be in the II

we see only the ﬁrst term survives. This is a standard result which is worth reiterating
since it shows that our energy density calculations and total energy calculations should be
in agreement as long as we use the above.
The state right after A’s interaction (at t = 0+) is given by |Ψ1⟩. We can compute the

a, b ∈R
⟨X2⟩≡⟨A0| X2 |A0⟩≡g + hi,

167

Then, we have
EA(x) = |z|2 −Re(⟨X2⟩z2)
= (1 −g)a2 + (1 + g)b2 + 2abh.
(A.32)
Notice that in the d = 2 case, we have ⟨X2⟩= 1 = g, h = 0 and EA(x) = 2b2 = 2[Im(z)]2.
As we will see below, the imaginary part of our Fourier integral z is the local one, while
the real part is non-local. It seems that for d > 2 (qudits), we can add energy density to
the ﬁeld non-locally. Before we proceed, note the following integral
Z
R+ dω ωeiωx =
Z
R
dω ω Θ(x)eiωx = −1
x2 −iπδ′(x)

we already see that the imaginary part is local (delta function) versus a non-local power-law
decay. Now, we can compute our z (convolution and integration by parts),

(A.35)
Note that the ﬁrst term is what gives us non-locality, the second term is local term and the
third term is also local (since λ′ transfers it compact support property to the product). A
question arises: can we have a choice of initial state |A0⟩such that we have both eﬃcient
QET and remove the non-locality of A? The only way to remove all non-locality is to have
⟨X2⟩= 1, this means we would need to choose |A0⟩= |x0⟩the eigenstate of X of eigenvalue
1 when d > 2. Unfortunately, the teleportation term goes as ∼⟨A0| XZ† |A0⟩, so if we
have |A0⟩= |x0⟩, then
⟨x0| XZ† |x0⟩= ⟨x0|xd−1⟩= 0
(A.36)
and we have no teleportation. Note that, our non-locality decays as the distance L−4,
which is a faster decay than the energy extracted L−2.

We clearly see that the S term is non-local. Essentially, this is because the S term was “a
factor of ω oﬀ”; note the following integrals
Z
R+ dω eiω(x−y) = πδ(x −y) +
i
(x −y)
Z
R+ dω ω eiω(x−y) = −

(x −y)2 −iπδ′(x −y)
(A.42)
which is obviously non-local.
A.5
Scaling Inequalities
Here we prove the inequality (6.94). In order to recover locality, we want the teleported
teleportation term (second term in (6.89)) to far outweigh the non-locality in EA(x) (second
term (6.93)) integrated with respect to B’s coupling to the ﬁeld µ(x), which represents to
leading order in distance the energy that B could extract from the non-local part of A’s
energy injection. To extract a positive amount of work through B’s interaction, we need
the teleportation term to outweigh the positive energy injected by B from switching costs
(we want the second term to outweigh the ﬁrst term in (6.89)). To both recover locality
and have positive work extracted from the ﬁeld by B, we need both of the following to hold

(A.43)
We can assume for now that d is suﬃciently large so that Im(Γ) ≈1. Consider L being
the distance between support of A and B’s coupling functions at time T, i.e. the distance
between supp(Fa) translated by T to the left and supp(Fb).
Then, using Lp(R) norm
notation, ∥f∥p ≡(

Now, by deﬁnition, we have ∥Fb∥1 = 1, where Fb is of compact support. Suppose we widen
the support of this function with respect to a parameter σ > 1 all the while keeping the
L1(R) norm ﬁxed, i.e.
