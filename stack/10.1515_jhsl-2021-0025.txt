Abstract: Within the framework of Historical Sociolinguistics and using a corpus of
ego-documents written by Spaniards from diﬀerent social backgrounds, this study
analyses the sociolinguistic proﬁles of three phenomena of variation and change that
took place in two critical periods in the history of Spanish: the Golden Age and the
Early Modern Spanish. The study focuses on three standard variants that would end
up displacing several vernacular forms whose use was much more widespread in
Golden Age Spanish: (a) the use of the complementiser que in doxastic predicates
depending on the verb creer [’believe, think’], to the detriment of the variant creer
+ Ø; (b) the analogical pronoun quienes in relative clauses with an explicit human
antecedent (’estos son los niños a quienes me dirigí’ [‘these are the children I spoke to’]),
as opposed to the traditional relative quien; (c) the diﬀusion of the demonstrative
pronoun allí [‘there’] at the expense of allá. Despite the success of the standard
variants in the eighteenth century, the three cases of variation show diﬀerent
sociolinguistic conditioning, which in turn is closely related to several parameters,
such as the speed and robustness of the respective changes, the typology of the
variables and the linguistic constraints at work in each case.

1 Introduction
The research conducted over the decades since the birth of sociolinguistics has
allowed scholars to establish several generalisations about usual correlations
between language variation and social structure. Thus, it is well known that the
employ of vernacular variants usually appears more in the speech of the lower

sociolects and more informal styles, unlike the standard forms, which become more
frequent in the speech of the higher sociolects and more formal registers (Labov 1972,
2001; Preston 1991; Tagliamonte 2012). Similarly, in the description of language
change in progress, several types have been identiﬁed, each with a diﬀerent
background in the social structure. This explains the speciﬁc metaphors (from above
and from below) that are frequently employed to characterise them (Ash 2013; Labov
2001; Tagliamonte 2012).
Sociolinguistics has also noted that both the spread of variants and sociolectal
constraints can ﬂuctuate considerably from one language variety to another. For
example, in Peninsular Spanish, a representative example of this is the pluralisation
of presentational haber (habían cambios vs. the prescriptive había cambios ‘there
were changes’). While the pluralised form (habían cambios) is widespread in several
Catalan-speaking communities, such as Catalonia and the Valencian Community,
its diﬀusion is still incipient in other Peninsular varieties (Blas-Arroyo 2011,
2018; Bouzouita and Pato 2019). Moreover, a linguistic variable may also present
signiﬁcant changes in terms of diachrony. Hence, a variant that once enjoyed
sociolinguistic prestige in a particular speech community later gave way to another,
with the corresponding change in the socio-stylistic conditioning. This is what
happened, for example, in Spanish with the imperfect and pluperfect of the
subjunctive ending, where the traditional prestige form for centuries was -se
(cantase ‘sing’), a role that was transferred to -ra (cantara ‘sing’) as of the 19th century
(Martínez 2001).
In the present study, we aim to delve deeper into this last line of research by
performing a comparative analysis of the sociolinguistic proﬁles exhibited by three
linguistic variables at two critical moments in the history of the language: the Golden
Age1 period and Early Modern Spanish (18th century). In addition to dealing with
cases of variation that aﬀect several grammatical categories of Spanish, the selection
of these three variables is explained because, even though they have not traditionally
been analysed as potential sociohistorical variables in the literature, some recent
studies have veriﬁed the existence of signiﬁcant extralinguistic correlations in
diﬀerent periods of the history of Spanish. However, although the transition from
Golden Age Spanish to Early Modern Spanish involved the ﬁrm consolidation of one
of the competing variants at the expense of others -relegated to much more restricted
1 Anglophone Hispanists generally use the concept of Early Modern Spanish to refer to Classical
Spanish, while Spanish philologists consider the beginnings of Modern Spanish to lie in the 18th
century. To avoid confusion, the term Golden Age Spanish will be used instead of Classical Spanish.
Without entering into a critical assessment of this term, which is also present in the periodisation of
other European languages (Rutten 2016), Golden Age is a cultural label widely used since the end of
the 18th century in Spain to refer to the extraordinary ﬂourishing of Spanish arts and literature from
the late 15th century to the last decades of the 17th century.

uses since then-their diﬀusion was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in each case. Some of them
displayed this privileged condition from the outset, while others only succeeded over
time (sometimes, after a long time). Besides, the sociolinguistic outcomes were also
heterogeneous, and several factors could have played a determining role, such as the
rate at which the changes took place or their linguistic typology.
Based on a corpus consisting of texts close to the pole of communicative imme-
diacy (Oesterreicher 2004), and, presumably closer to the vernacular of past times, the
three variables have been the separate targets of several variationist studies carried
out aspartofa research projectinhistoricalsociolinguistics conducted bythe authorof
these pages.2 The main objective of this article is to compare the sociolinguistic proﬁles
exhibited by these variables in the two historical periods mentioned above,3 to shed
some light on the potential reasons for these diﬀerent trajectories.
This article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review the three linguistic
variables that are the object of this study, focusing on their genesis and evolution and
the most relevant linguistic aspects. Although the empirical analysis also considers
these structural aspects, given the aims of this study, in Section 3, we limit the coding
description to explain how several socio-stylistic factor groups have been established
in all cases. The most important methodological aspects, such as the corpus used or
the quantitative analysis carried out, will be the subject of attention in Section 4. The
main results are summarised in the diﬀerent subsections of 5, which will serve as a
preamble for discussing the most relevant results arising from the comparative
analysis (Section 6) and the synthesis of the main conclusions (Section 7).
2 Origin and evolution of the linguistic variables
2.1 Creer (que) ‘to think/believe (that)’ + complement clause
Example (1), included in a letter sent in 1564 by a Spaniard by the name of Martín
Delgado to an acquaintance of his living in Mexico City, shows a linguistic variation
that continued for a long time in Spanish. In the excerpt, it can be seen how the
speaker makes use of the same expression using the complementiser que, ﬁrstly, and
then immediately afterwards without it:
2 The partial data on which this comparative study is based have appeared in previous studies
published by members of the research group led by the author of these pages at the Jaume I
University (Castellón, Spain), namely: Blas Arroyo (2020), Blas Arroyo and González (2022), Blas
Arroyo and Velando (2019). The co-authors of the latter two papers agree that the data will be used
again in this article for comparative purposes.

Despu´es que de esta tierra v.md. salió no he visto letra suya, ni aun creo que se
ha acordado de mí […] Aquí creo Ø nos ha engañado un Agustín López, hijo de
un conquistador, vecino de M´ejico, que se dice Martín López
‘Since you left this land, I have not seen any letter of yours, nor do I think that
have remembered me […] Here I believe (that) we have been deceived by a
certain Agustín López, son of a conquistador, a resident of Mexico, who calls
himself Martín López.’
(El hilo que une, 1564)
The root of these syntactic expressions is to be found in the passage from Latin to
Romance when constructions with a complementiser were used to mark subordi-
nation in clauses with a verb in a ﬁnite form, thus replacing the schemes typical of
classical Latin, where this subordination was generally presented in the inﬁnitive
and with a subject in the accusative (AcI). However, even in the classical period, this
syntactic scheme competed with other complements introduced by quod or ut, albeit
initially in diﬀerent contexts (Väänänen 1968). However, as time went by, the
boundaries between these uses started to become hazy, and this led to a progressive
replacement of the AcI structures with those introduced by a conjunction. Although
in Romance, the AcI constructions were still to be maintained occasionally in some
causative structures and with verbs of perception (Cano 1977), the completive clauses
with language and understanding verbs went on to generalise the structure with the
subordinating que.
Although this became the variant par excellence, at various times in Spanish
history, it has coexisted with another: the elision of the complementiser. Examples of
this elision appear as early as the Cantar de Mio Çid at the beginning of the 13th
century (“Digades al conde Ø non lo tenga a mal” ‘Tell the count Ø not to take it
badly’). According to Folgar (1997: 350), in literary texts: “the conjunction can be
elided on certain occasions (especially if the governing verb is placed immediately
after the governed one and if there is no coreferentiality in the subjects of these two
verbs), without this implying any modiﬁcation in the syntactic structure” (our
translation). The omission of the complementiser, however, could also be due to the
analogy with other complementary structures with subjunctive verbs governed by
volitional verbs (“Suplicando a sus Alteza Ø mande rreuocar la merçed” ‘Begging
his Highness Ø to revoke the grace’; apud Serradilla 1997: 209). In these cases, the
post-positioning of the subordinate clause and the very presence of the subjunctive
could be suﬃcient to ensure the relationship of syntactic dependency. Hence, as an
added mark of subordination, the conjunction could be interpreted as redundant
(Raible 1983: 279).
Nevertheless, elision has also been characterised as a stylistic resource to
prevent the accumulation of complementisers, mainly when the sentence consists of
100
Blas Arroyo

two or more coordinated clauses (García Cornejo 2006: 234–235). Additionally, it
appears to have been consolidated as a signiﬁcant syntactic resource in the works of
some classical authors (we ﬁnd testimonies in Cervantes, Calderón, Quevedo or
Tirso), but especially in Saint Teresa de Jesús. In this respect, Folgar (1997: 380)
defended that “elision must be interpreted as a stylistic resource that implies a
deviation deliberately sought by the writer” (our translation), and in no way as
an imitation of common speech, since the omission is infrequent in the writings
of other authors such as Lope de Rueda, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza or Fray Luis
de León (in the same line, see Keniston 1937: 676; Pountain 2016: 18–19). Octavio de
Toledo y Huerta (2011: 264 ﬀ.) recalled that the Saint Teresa’s preference for elisions
was also advocated by other authors such as the humanist Juan de Vald´es, who was
also for a simpler syntactic scheme.
However, a review of several grammars of the time suggests that the most
prestigious form in the written language involved the use of que. This perception is
reinforced in some 17th-century works, such as the Gramática by Correas (1626/2001),
who explicitly defended the variant with the subordinate complementiser and
described its elision as a “novelty” or “slip”. Similarly, Jim´enez Patón (1614/2001)
and Villar (1651/2001) insisted that certain verbs must be accompanied by phrases
introduced by que.
2.2 The alternation of quienes/quien ‘who’ in relative
subordinate clauses with a plural antecedent
For the construction of relative subordinates with plural animate antecedents,
Spanish has diﬀerent resources, one of which involves using the pronoun quien.4
However, until the almost deﬁnitive generalisation of the plural analogical form
(quienes), this variant coexisted in history with the more traditional and invariable
pronoun, quien, which served to express both singular and plural referents.
Examples (2) and (3) show this alternation in letters written by Spanish emigrants in
America during the last third of the 16th century:
(2)
Y en dandosela, se puso delante, sin ver el dicho Fonseca qui´en le avia dado,
por aver sido por detras y estar ´el ocupado con los demás, a quienes dezia que
se tuviesen …
4 Another resource is the combination of the article and the pronoun que: “… y en todo muestra a los
que te trataren la virtud y cordura ques razon” [and in everything he shows those who have had
dealings with you the virtue and good sense that is due] (Cartas de particulares en Indias del siglo XVI,
1590).

‘And on giving it to them, he stood before them, not seeing the
aforementioned Fonseca who had given it to him because he was behind
him and was busy with the others, whom he said they had …’
(Documentos lingüísticos de la Nueva España, 1576).
(3)
… le da espuelas para q me le inbie con brebedad pues para ellos sera lo
mejor pues no tengo hijos a quien lo dejar
‘… he urges him to send it to me soon because it will be better for them as I
have no children (who) to leave it to.’
(Cartas de particulares en Indias del siglo XVI, 1576).
According to Corominas and Pascual (1980–1991; s.v. qu´e), quien originates in the
accusative quĕm of the Latin interrogative pronoun (quis, quae, quid) and during
the Middle Ages was invariable for the singular and the plural. Things started to
change as of the 16th century, when the form quien developed a speciﬁc variant for
the plural, quienes (Lapesa 1980: 397; Men´endez Pidal 1904/1941: §101). Nevertheless,
the opinions are far from unanimous about what the timeline of this change might
have been. For example, López Ruano (2011: 82) concluded that the use of quienes “did
not spread until well into the 17th century”. Girón Alconchel (2004: 871) dated this
innovative variant back to the end of the 16th century, although he noted that the
change was slow. Iglesias (1996: 513) insisted on this idea and recalled that “the ﬁrst
testimonies of analogical plurals appeared in the ﬁrst half of the 16th century, but
they were still met with great resistance throughout the 17th century”. However,
Lope Blanch (1997: 290–291) suggested that the plural quienes probably began to be
used in the spoken language as of the ﬁrst half of the 16th century; it later moved into
literary language and was not to become generalised until the last decades of the next
century, which accounts for its late discovery in written texts.
There are few references to these relative pronouns in the grammars and
dictionaries of the 16th century, although, with some exceptions, the preference for
the invariable use of quien prevails, either explicitly or in the examples provided
in them. Things changed, however, in the 17th century, when quienes was
already considered for plural antecedents. Even so, still in this period, prominent
grammarians (Correas, Jim´enez Patón, Doergangk, etc.) regarded the invariable use
of quien as usual, and some of them even qualiﬁed quienes as “not very elegant”
(Salazar 1627: 397) or “unnecessary” (Villar 1651: 8–9) (apud Lope Blanch 1997:
285–288). From the 18th century onwards, however, the tendency to include the
plural form quienes became so intense that people barely noticed the old use of
quien in this context (Martínez Gómez-Gayoso 1769: 103–104; Sobrino 1738: 45).
102

Nevertheless, even in this period, some authors still accepted the invariable
etymological form (Benito de San Pedro 1769).
2.3 The variation allí/allá ‘there’
Examples (4) and (5) show the alternating use of allí and allá in the same semantic
setting. Note how in both cases, the adverbial form is associated with a precise spatial
reference, the city of Seville, which two emigrants in the Indies refer to in their
letters to their relatives in Spain:
(4)
… se vien[e?] fasta sevilla en vn carro o dos y alli se aliñan de todo p[ar]a
pasar adelante
‘… they come to Seville in a carriage or two and there they pick up supplies
with which to be able to continue on their way’
(Cartas de particulares en Indias del siglo XVI, 1587)
(5)
… yo ubiera umbiado tres u quatro barras de plata que valen alla mil y
quinientos ducados. aca nos dan tan malas nuevas que alla en sevilla la
toman i toda para el rey
‘… I would have sent three or four ingots of silver that are worth one
thousand ﬁve hundred ducats there. Here the bad news they give us is that,
there, in Seville, they take it all for the king’
(Cartas de particulares en Indias del siglo XVI, 1577)
The expression *ad illic has been proposed as the origin of the adverb allí (Corominas
1980–1991: s.v. allí; Sánchez Lancis 1990). Since the ﬁrst written examples (back in the
early 12th century), allí appeared in texts with diﬀerent locative values such as
direction, location, origin and trajectory. Later, from the 15th century onwards, the
ﬁrst temporal values also appeared as a metaphorical translation of the spatial
coordinates (Company and Espinosa 2014: 161). On the other hand, allá would have
derived from *ad illac, an expression in which the second element already indicated
transition in Latin (‘por allá’ [over there]). It appeared in the Cantar de Mio Çid and, in
the opinion of some authors, would initially have a diﬀerent meaning to allí. For
example, according to Corominas (1980–1991: s.v. allá) “[allá] has always been
distinguished from allí because it refers to a broader […] or more vaguely located
place”. In passing, this would explain why it accepts increases such as quantiﬁcation
(más allá ‘beyond’) to a greater extent than allí (? más allí) (Company and Espinosa
2014: 129–246). Sedano (1996) also suggested that the primitive meaning of adverbs
ending in –á (lugar por donde ‘place through which’) may have extended overtime to
the coding of broad, ill-deﬁned spaces. In contrast, allí (like aquí) would delimit
Same people, diﬀerent outcomes
103

spaces and times in a more precise way, which would allow them to be interpreted
preferably as speciﬁc points and not as generic areas (in the same sense, see RAE/
ASALE (2009). Other authors, however, have drawn attention to the fact that these
diﬀerences are more likely to be due to the speakers’ subjective perception than to
truly objective distinctions (P´erez Saldanya and Rigau 2011; Terrado 1990).
Furthermore, it has also been proposed that allá denotes dynamic circum-
stances, unlike allí, which is more closely linked to static values (Bello 1847/1972; RAE/
ASALE 2009). The Latin case system allowed for the distinction between the place in
which and directionality, which could explain why such duality has been maintained
in Spanish. Likewise, the adverbial opposition has also been related to other
linguistic constraints such as contrast (Terrado 1990)5 or idiomaticity (Company and
Espinosa 2014; Sedano 1996).6
The fact that both forms are possible in most contexts explains the publication of
several dialectological and sociolinguistic studies on this variation in contemporary
Spanish-speaking communities (Carbonero 1979; Gallucci 2007; Sedano 1996, 2000;
etc.). Things change, however, when it comes to diachrony. In fact, we do not know of
any studies that have exhaustively examined the conditioning of this variation
throughout the Spanish language history.
3 Socio-stylistic coding
All the empirical analyses on which the current study is based address the potential
inﬂuence of linguistic, stylistic and social factors, considered together in a mixed-
eﬀects logistic regression analysis (for more details, see Section 4 below). However,
considering that our primary interest is focused on the socio-stylistic proﬁle shown
by the linguistic variables, in this section, we will concentrate on how these factor
groups have been coded.7
To deﬁne the stylistic factor group (tenor in the coding), we combined the
domain in which communication occurs and the type of relationship established
between the interlocutors, particularly in epistolary correspondence (see Section 4).
Thus, in the close sphere, we place all those occurrences of the linguistic variables
5 According to this hypothesis, the forms ending in -í are used to take account of absolute circum-
stances, which do not need to be set against others – just the opposite to the adverbs ending in -á,
which are used in contrastive settings.
6 It has been said that allá appears more frequently in the formation of phraseological units
(encontramos eso aquí y allá ‘we ﬁnd that here and there’), which could result from the above-
mentioned greater semantic imprecision.
7 Moreover, unlike the linguistic factor groups, speciﬁc to each variable, such social and stylistic
factors are common to all three phenomena.

taken from letters in which close family and personal relationships are observed,
such as those between spouses, parents and children, siblings, close friends, lovers,
etc. Similarly, a signiﬁcant part of the autobiographical texts is included in this
section. In the absence of a direct interlocutor, in those diaries and memoirs, the
writer also instils a high dose of subjectivity in narrating the vicissitudes of his or
her life. Conversely, we consider the epistolary communication between people
separated on the axes of power and solidarity as being representative of a more
distant character, whether they are from subordinates to superiors (or vice versa) or
between distant relatives, which is well reﬂected, for instance, in the use of
considerably more formal forms of address, as well as in peripheric sequences such
as greetings and leave-takings. Consequently, we test the hypothesis that as the
variants analysed became the prestige forms in their respective variables, they
were used increasingly more frequently in distant contexts, whereas close contexts
hindered their expansion.
At the social level, we consider ﬁrst the social status or rank, which are concepts
that, to avoid unfortunate anachronisms, we prefer to that of social class. In the three
cases investigated here, we initially established a tripartite classiﬁcation with
representatives located at three stages, even though the aﬃliation criteria may vary
from one period to another. In all periods, what we have called the social elites
included representatives of the nobility and high clergy and some cultural elites such
as writers, intellectuals, humanists, scientists, grammarians, etc. However, in the
18th century, some of the commercial and ﬁnancial bourgeoisie joined this group, as
individuals whose rise in society placed them in a privileged position (Fernández
Díaz 2004). The middle groups were made up of several intermediate clergies (friars,
priests, chaplains, deans, etc.), civil professionals (graduates, lawyers, doctors,
teachers, traders, shopkeepers, etc.), as well as middle-ranking oﬃcials in diﬀerent
branches of state or municipal administration (mayors, army oﬃcers, etc.). Lastly,
the low stratum comprised individuals in manual trades (turners, miners, tanners,
carpenters, shoemakers, tailors, barbers, shop assistants, servants, etc.) and do-
mestic work (mainly in the case of women). However, given the proximity of the
results obtained in the middle and low groups, which were in all cases a signiﬁcant
distance away from those found among the elites, for the regression analysis, we
compared these latter with the rest of society. By doing so, we intended to facilitate
the statistical analysis and one of the main objectives of the research, namely, to
check how these elites behaved as regards the three variation phenomena studied
and which (we hypothesise) should always be aligned with the more prestigious
variants.
In contrast to the relative balance of the samples obtained in this social strati-
ﬁcation, the imbalance between men and women prevails in the corpus. Only 10–15%
of the writers in the Golden Age corpus were women, a rate that decreases further

still among 18th-century texts. This fact undoubtedly reﬂects a strongly patriarchal
society in which women’s access to education and writing was very restricted until
recent times (Castillo 2006). Unfortunately, this is a signiﬁcant limitation, which may
adversely aﬀect the results. Still, we tested the hypothesis according to which women
championed the use of prestige variants to a greater extent than men, which has
been a recurring outcome in many contemporary western speech communities
(Tagliamonte 2012: 61–62) but perhaps also in earlier periods of history according to
some recent ﬁndings in historical sociolinguistics (Nevalainen and Raumolin-
Brunberg 2017 [2003], Nevalainen 2018).
Lastly, we have also considered the context in which the texts were written. In
this regard, we distinguished between documents written by Spaniards in Spain and
those written by Spanish emigrants in diﬀerent territories of America, which had
been conquered by Spain as of the late 15th century and where individuals from very
diverse dialectal backgrounds came together, with potential consequences on lin-
guistic variation and change (Penny 2000). So far from their places of birth and in
intense contact with migrants arriving from many diﬀerent places, it could be
assumed that those who wrote from America would show patterns of variation
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from those of their fellow citizens who had remained in Spain.
4 Corpus and methodology
As said above, this work is part of a research project in historical sociolinguistics to
study language variation and change at diﬀerent points in the history of Spanish
(see note 2). In this case, such moments coincide with two signiﬁcant milestones
in the periodisation of the language, namely, the Golden Age (16 and 17th centuries)
and Early Modern Spanish (18th century), respectively. Table 1 shows some
dimensions of the corpus of immediacy communicative texts written by Spanish
authors or by individuals who, although born elsewhere, lived most of their lifetime
in Spain. The volume of words available in each century is relatively balanced, which
is not the case for the number of writers. The two best represented centuries are

the sixteenth and the eighteenth, largely thanks to the meritorious task of several
philologists and social historians in editing these texts in recent years. In contrast, the
seventeenth century shows the worst ﬁgures regarding the number of writers
considered. However, this circumstance is oﬀset by the greater length of its texts.
Nevertheless, since the data used in this research come from previous varia-
tionist studies (see note 2), with speciﬁc targets and interests in each case, the
exact periodisation of each variable diﬀers. These are the precise stages analysed in
each case:
(a)
Use of creer que (vs. creer Ø) + complement clause: 1st period (16th, 17th
centuries); 2nd period (18th century)
(b)
Extension of quienes (vs. quien) in relative clauses with a plural antecedent:
4 periods (1500–1580; 1581–1660; 1661–1740 and 1741–1820)
(c)
Diﬀusion of the demonstrative adverb allí (vs. allá): 1st period (16th century);
2nd period (18th century)
One of the main methodological innovations introduced in this historical sociolin-
guistics research project is the use of texts that, although written in nature, are
conceptually closer to the pole of communicative immediacy (Oesterreicher 2004).
Approximately 90% of these documents are private correspondence written by
Spanish people. There is also a tiny sample of autobiographical works, such as diaries
and memoirs – genres that were not very frequent among Spaniards until more
recent times, but of which we also have some representative samples from between
the 16th and 18th centuries. Taken from diﬀerent sources (public and private
archives, private collections, etc.), all the texts included in the corpus come from
editions made from original documents, not later copies that could alter the language
previously used. Still, in the ﬁnal selection of texts, we had taken special care to
employ only those in which the editors had explicitly stated to respect the original in
transcribing the manuscripts, with no modernisations except for some slight
changes, if any, to modernise accentuation and punctuation in order to facilitate
reading.8 Most of the texts are autographic, although some letters, especially those
sent by the lower ranks in the 16th century – a period when illiteracy rates were very
high among these people (Castillo 2006) – were probably dictated to scribes who,
in exchange for payment, set them down on paper. Although dictated letters
make any approach to phonic and graphic variation extremely diﬃcult, this need
not necessarily be the case in the study of grammatical and discursive variation
(see Bergs 2005 for an overview).

As has been stressed in recent times, these texts are conceptually closer to oral
speech than other more formal discursive traditions (Oesterreicher 2004), making
them particularly suitable for studying the vernacular in earlier times when there
were no oral testimonies available. Among the diﬀerent “ideal” communicative
contexts favouring the production of spoken–written testimonies outlined by
Oesterreicher (2004), we have given preference to texts that this author charac-
terised as having “written competence with an oral component”. The latter is
particularly true with epistolary correspondence, especially when (as in this case) we
are dealing with private letters whose writers are distributed across the whole
society (Elspaß 2012; Schneider 2013). The periods analysed also represent relevant
milestones for the genre, as they match decisive moments in America’s colonisation
by Spaniards when letters were continuously being sent from one side of the Atlantic
to the other (Fernández Alcaide 2009; Stangl 2012). Moreover, the corpus also oﬀers
various styles, as the topics and the relations of power and solidarity between the
interlocutors are diverse (see Section 3 above). Besides, private letters provide
valuable testimonies for sociolinguistic analysis as they reveal biographical details
for measuring speciﬁc extralinguistic parameters (Okulska 2010; Raumolin-Brun-
berg 2005). Furthermore, another reason that justiﬁes a particular association of
private correspondence with the vernacular usages of past times is that, at least
initially, the letters were not written with the intention of them ever being published
(Palander-Collin and Nevala 2005).
The variable that is found most frequently in the texts is the alternation between
the demonstrative adverbs allí/allá. The very nature of the letters can explain this
fact since the senders often mention referents within the space-time reference
framework of those participating in the communicative act. It is followed by the
variation among doxastic predicates (creer Ø/que), which is also frequent in letters
and autobiographical texts. Conversely, the use of quien or quienes in relative clauses
with a plural antecedent occurs far less frequently in discourse.
The use of a non-tagged corpus makes it necessary to employ a concordancer
(Wordsmith 6.0) to retrieve the instances of the linguistic variables. Following the
principle of accountability (Labov 1972), all tokens of the reference variants are
located, besides those of the alternative forms that could appear in their place. Each
token is then coded according to several linguistic, stylistic and social factor groups,
which allows us to assess diﬀerent hypotheses about the conditioning of variation.
Given the speciﬁc interests in this study (see Section 1), we will focus mainly on
stylistic and social issues, with occasional references to linguistic conditioning when
the occasion requires it.
For the quantitative analysis, we used Rbrul (Johnson 2009). This computer
program performs a mixed-eﬀects logistic regression statistical model in a relatively
intuitive and straightforward way. It can be used to discover the relevance of the
108

independent variables considered and their potential interactions.9 Rbrul also
evaluates the consistency of the results against the background of the idiolectal
variation, strengthening the statistical signiﬁcance of those factor groups whose
eﬀect is suﬃciently robust to be able to resist the potential bias of speciﬁc individual
preferences.
Together with the absolute frequencies and percentages, which allow for an
initial exploration of the results, the multivariate analysis provides diﬀerent
elements of proof that can be used to interpret the variation in each period
(Tagliamonte 2012: 122ss.):
(a)
the list of independent variables selected and not selected by the regression
model
(b)
the robustness of these variables
(c)
the signiﬁcance of the diﬀerent factors within each factor group, oﬀered in the
form of statistical weights
(d)
the explanatory hierarchy, or direction of eﬀect, from the most favourable to the
most unfavourable constraints
Moreover, the comparative method adopted in this study involves investigating the
connection between the patterns of variation presented by similar samples, as occurs
in this case with parallel corpora of immediacy texts in diﬀerent moments in Spanish
history. The idea underlying this approach to analysing language change is that
its characterisation can be extracted from the contrastive examination of the
quantitative results reported in each period (Poplack 2011; Tagliamonte 2012).
5 Results
In this section, we oﬀer the results obtained in the empirical examination of each
variable. As already mentioned, our interest is centred on the socio-stylistic
conditioning, given our main objectives in the study. However, this does not prevent
us from summarising some of the most relevant structural aspects involved in each
case, as some may also have implications for speciﬁc proﬁles of language change, as
we will see later (see Section 6).
9 In these analyses, all linguistic and extra-linguistic predictors were run together in Rbrul,
including the identity of the writers, which is analysed as a random factor. On the other hand,
although the focus of attention in this article is how the same socio-stylistic factor groups condition
the three linguistic variables examined, in each section, we also review -albeit more succinctly for the
sake of brevity-the main linguistic constraints, which, not surprisingly, are largely speciﬁc to each
variation.

5.1 Creer que/Ø + complement clause
Table 2 shows the distribution of both variants in the two periods considered
(see Section 4). As can be observed, entry into modern Spanish (18th century) led to a
signiﬁcant increase in the use of the que variant (70%), compared to the averages
obtained in Golden Age Spanish (57%).
However, Figure 1 shows that the progression of this variant throughout the 18th
century was very gradual and sustained over time, as opposed to the more abrupt
nature of changes in the classical period. Indeed, the ﬁgure shows how, in Golden Age
Spanish, creer que even saw its primacy over the elided form jeopardised, especially
during the second half of the 16th century, when the latter peaked.
In the Golden Age period and the 18th century, the variation was constrained
linguistically by the degree of adjacency between the verbs and the person of creer.
In the ﬁrst case, the data show a more signiﬁcant presence of the complementiser the

further creer and the verb of the subordinate clause are from each other. Cognitively,
this distance seems to warrant the presence of the subordinate link to a greater
extent. The results also show that the highest rates of creer que are produced in
contexts where the ﬁrst person does not intervene (yo creo ‘I think/believe’), which is
the opposite to what happens with elisions throughout history. Along with these
signs of structural persistence, however, a few changes in grammar can also be seen
over time. Thus, in the 18th century (but not in the Golden Age period), the presence
of a que in the previous context produces a “horror aequi” eﬀect that discourages the
selection of this variant, perhaps to avoid the cacophonous eﬀect that would be
created by the simultaneous presence of two (or more) que. At the same time, while in
Golden Age Spanish, the future in the complement clause appears as one of the most
favourable verbal contexts for elisions (creo Ø no vendrá ‘I don’t think Ø he will
come’), in the 18th century, this factor group underwent a semantic restructuring.
Elisions are now favoured in all tenses characterised by high rates of virtuality and
low factuality (this is the case again of the future, but also the conditional or the
subjunctive tenses), which is just the opposite to the more factual paradigms
(the present and past indicative tenses), among which the use of the complementiser
increased signiﬁcantly.
However, despite the latter’s relevance, the main changes in the conﬁguration of
the variable took place at the socio-stylistic level. Indeed, the results exhibited in
Table 3 show some notable changes in the transition from one period to another.
Hence, in Golden Age Spanish, the variation is sensitive to both the communicative
tenor and the writers’ social status, while these factor groups faded away in the
Enlightenment period.
Table 3 shows the selection of creer que is favoured in the more formal and
distant contexts (0.59; 72%) during the classical period, while the closer ones dis-
favour it to a similar extent (0.41; 49%). Nevertheless, the inﬂuence of this factor
group is diluted among the 18th-century data when the proportions of the que variant
are much closer in the two communicative settings. Moreover, the same happens on
a sociolectal level: in Golden Age Spanish, the variation shows a break between the
elites and the rest of society, with the former acting as the main spearhead of creer
que (0.62; 66%). Given these results, the linguistic variable could be interpreted as a
sociolinguistic marker during the Golden Age period, given its particular sensitivity
to sociolectal and stylistic variation (Labov 1972: 346–347; Tagliamonte 2012: 27–30).
This characterisation can be better appreciated in Table 4, which oﬀers the results
of a re-analysis where the two independent variables, tenor and social status, are
cross-tabulated.
As can be seen, there is indeed a close correlation between the two factors, so
that as we go down the social pyramid and the scale of formality, the uses of the
complementiser decrease. Hence, both in the social elites and in the rest of society,

111

creer que increases in the more formal and distant communicative spheres and
decreases in the closer and more personal ones. Still in both stylistic domains, the
higher numbers are always for the elites. However, little of this remained in the 18th
century: the proportions of this variant were still somewhat greater in the distant
sphere, but the diﬀerences were minor, while the sociolectal correlations diﬀered
from those noted previously.

Conversely, during the Enlightenment period, some social constraints arose that
had not worked before. One of them was the gender of the writers, which was
selected by the regression and revealed the greater diﬀusion of creer que in female
speech (0.69; 83%), at some distance from that of their male counterparts (0.31; 62%).
In this regard, our results are in line with one of the usual outcomes of genderlect
variation, in which women champion the use of the prestige variants, either in the
contexts of change that point towards the prestige norms or in stable variation, as
seems to be the case with this linguistic variable in the 18th century. Nevertheless, the
highly unbalanced sample between men and women in the corpus (see Section 3)
forces us to be cautious in interpreting this result.
These cautions disappear with the context in which the texts were written. We
have distinguished between letters and other ego-texts written in Spain and those
written in America under migratory conditions in which interdialectal contact must
have been the norm, with potential consequences for variation and language change.
Far more balanced than gender in terms of sample size, the results of this factor
group show a considerable distance between the two periods examined. Thus, in
Golden Age Spanish, the diﬀerences in frequency between the two groups of writers
were of minor importance and were ruled out by the regression analysis. In contrast,
the frequency distances became broader in the 18th century, with a notably greater
vitality of creer que in the European varieties (0.63; 74%) than in the American ones
(0.37; 54%). Could elisions be thought of as an archaism still deeply rooted in America
in the 18th century while mainly receding in Spain? Did this variation change on the
two sides of the Atlantic in line with the notable diﬀerences in frequency?
We carried out a new regression analysis to answer these questions, comparing
American and European data from the 18th century after cross-tabulating them with
the most relevant linguistic factor groups reported at the beginning of this section.
The results of this comparative analysis are shown in Table 5.
The data show that, despite the diﬀerences in frequency in nearly all contexts,
striking parallelisms are observed in the conditioning on both sides. The indepen-
dent variables selected as signiﬁcant and non-signiﬁcant in America were the same
as those in Europe. The only exception was the person/tense of the verb creer, which
was not selected in European varieties, although the diﬀerences in frequency
pointed in the same direction as in America.
5.2 Quienes/quien with a plural antecedent
The results obtained in this variable diﬀered from those observed in the previous
section. Thus, as shown in Table 6, the variant that later became almost categorical in
relative clauses with animate antecedents (quienes) was very much in the minority

during a large part of the Golden Age period. It was only from the second half of the
17th century onwards that quienes began to take oﬀ, in an abrupt change that took
place in a short time, and which continued, although at a more moderate pace, in the
following period.
From 1660 onwards, when the change began to accelerate in society, the
variation was linguistically constrained by the type of relative clause, so that
the innovative form quienes found a preferential environment in non-deﬁning clauses
(“estos son mis familiares, dequienes tehabl´e hace una semana” ‘these are my relatives,
whom I spoke to you about a week ago’), rather than in deﬁning clauses (“estos son los
familiares de quienestehabl´e” ‘theseare therelatives I spoke to youabout’).Incontrast,

in the initial period of the change (1581–1660),10 the variation was conditioned by the
syntactic complexity of the antecedents and by their semantic category. Thus, the
coordination of antecedents favoured quienes (“mi tío y mi padre, a quienes no veo
desde hace tiempo” ‘my uncle and my father, whom I have not seen for some time’),
and especially those involving a proper noun (“mi padre y Pedro, a quienes no veo
desde hace tiempo” ‘my father and Pedro, whom I have not seen for some time’).
However, the signiﬁcance of both factor groups weakened in the following stages,
coinciding with the phase of abrupt diﬀusion of the innovative variant.
On the extralinguistic level (see Table 7), we begin by highlighting the
irrelevance this time of the context factor group, with very similar distributions in
the European and American varieties. Neither does the gender of the writers show
any signiﬁcant diﬀerences between men and women in this variation. The apparent
distances in the period 1661–1740 are based again on a signiﬁcant imbalance in the
Table : Contribution of the extralinguistic factors to the selection of quienes in three periods.

10 Given the virtual absence of variation during the ﬁrst stage considered (1500–1580), with barely
3% of the occurrences of quienes, for the regression analysis, we only examine the following three
periods: initial (1581–1660), intermediate (1661–1740) and ﬁnal (1741–1820).

115

samples, with only 16 female tokens (8% of the total). These rules out the possibility of
measuring any possible genderlect diﬀerences with precision, which are not
observed in the other periods either.
The status of the writers is an entirely diﬀerent case. This factor group shows
some changes in the direction of eﬀect that suggest diverse sociolectal forces
at diﬀerent times. For example, it is not the case in the initial stage of change
(1581–1660), when both the elites and the rest of society displayed similar ﬁgures
(14% vs. 12%). However, things are pretty diﬀerent in the next phase, in which the
change begins to expand. At that moment, the highest rank does not favour the new
uses of quienes (0.33; 27%), unlike the rest of society (0.67; 68%). It seems, in short, that
during this critical stage in the evolution of the relative pronouns, the representa-
tives of the highest levels of society still exhibited a conservative behaviour, opposed
to a change from below, such as the one that seemed to be triggered in this period.
Another piece of evidence favouring the interpretation of quienes spreading as a
change from below can be obtained after cross-tabulating the social status and the
tenor of the interactions. Although the latter factor group is not selected in isolation
by the regression analysis, the period 1661–1740 is the only one with some apparent
diﬀerences between close (63%) and distant contexts (50%). Initially, this contrast ﬁts
well with the preferential diﬀusion of changes from below in more spontaneous
registers (Labov 2001: 274). However, these distances become even more signiﬁcant
when connected with the writers’ social status, as shown in Table 8.
The table shows that the greatest obstacle to the diﬀusion of quienes with a plural
antecedent takes place in the most distant communicative settings by the social elites
(0.38; 30%), with their more personal communications in a neutral position (0.49;
42%). In contrast, the rest of society appears as much more favourable towards using
the innovative variant (0.72; 68%).
On the other hand, the conversion of this variant into the deﬁnitive new prestige
form was already very close in time, as revealed by the data in Table 7 for the
following period (1741–1820). At that moment, the stylistic and sociolectal diﬀerences
noted in the previous phase of sharp expansion had wholly disappeared, reﬂecting
the almost universal adoption of the plural pronoun.

5.3 Allí (vs. allá)
Table 9 reﬂects the distribution of the adverbs allí and allá in the two periods now
under consideration (16th and 18th centuries), showing a notable change in the
preferences for each form over time. Thus, while in early Golden Age Spanish, the
unmarked variant was allá, in the 18th, century this role was played by allí, with
averages already close to the ﬁgures found in contemporary speech communities.
Moreover, the following ﬁgures provide information about another relevant
fact: the change favouring the variant allí is visible along the whole-time axis.
Nevertheless, in the 16th century (Figure 2), this change only seems to have been
activated in the last three decades, with ﬁgures that double the far more moderate
ones in the rest of the century.
The 18th century also displayed a favourable evolution of this adverb, with
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the ﬁrst part of the century and the rest. As Figure 3
reveals, there was a signiﬁcant leap forward in selecting allí from the middle of the
century onwards, even though, from then on, frequencies level out.
That said, we have also found that the linguistic conditioning of the variation is
identical at all times. Thus, in both periods, allí is favoured in the same contexts:
(a) precise circumstantial coordinates; (b) states and movements that point to the
origin; (c) non-contrastive contexts; (d) the presence of adverbs of the same series in
the previous context (forms in -í, such as allí or aquí); and (e) the positions before the
governing element (for more details on each of them, see Section 2.3). Despite this
structural persistence in linguistic conditioning, the strength of these factors
weakened over time so that the distance between the most and least favourable
contexts was considerably reduced in the 18th century.
Notwithstanding the (weakened) maintenance of these linguistic constraints,
this variation shows some notable changes in the socio-stylistic conditioning. As
shown in Table 10, the extralinguistic factor groups display a very diﬀerent proﬁle at
each stage.

The summary of what happened in the 16th century is simple, as none of the
independent variables considered showed any notable (and far less signiﬁcant)
diﬀerences. It is perhaps the correlate of a still incipient moment in the spreading of
the change, which was only clearly activated in the last three decades of the century
(see Figure 2). It would not be surprising if the linguistic variable failed to show any

clear sociolinguistic correlations in these circumstances while the variation ran
preferably along structural paths. The case was diﬀerent, however, in the 18th
century. Leaving aside the gender diﬀerences in this last period, also burdened here
by a considerable imbalance in the samples, the data reveal the signiﬁcant incidence
of some extralinguistic factors that, either in isolation or in interaction, highlight a
sociolinguistic proﬁle that is far more advanced and runs parallel with the notable
frequency changes mentioned earlier.
One of those factors is the tenor of the interactions. The results of the regression
conﬁrm the incidence of this factor group and suggest that the more distant texts are
those that favour the selection of allí the most (0.60; 77%), as opposed to the closer and
more personal documents, in which the adverb still competes on equal terms with
allá (0.40; 50%). The inﬂuence of this factor also interacts with the writers’ social
status, the independent relevance of which is also guaranteed by the regression, with
social elites as the leading promoters of the expanding variant (0.65; 76%), as opposed
to the more conservative behaviour of the rest of society (0.35; 51%).
Moreover, cross-tabulation between these two factor groups, whose proportions
are summarised in Figure 4, shows some noteworthy trends. As can be observed, the
elites always outnumber the rest of society in the use of allí. Nevertheless, the
diﬀerence between the two groups in the more distant texts is considerably lower
than in the closer ones, where the use of allí by the higher rank doubles (67%) the

averages found in the others (34%). A re-analysis in which both factor groups were
considered together allowed us to discover a perfect gradation between three levels
(see Table 11): at one extreme, the distant texts (regardless of social status) are those
that favour allí the most (0.66; 77%), followed by close communication among the
elites (0.55; 67%); ﬁnally, at the other end of this continuum, the most personal and
intimate documents written by the rest of society exert an unfavourable eﬀect on
the selection of this adverb (0.30; 34%).
A similar interaction operates with the context in which the texts were written.
The data in Table 10 show diﬀerences in the uses of allí in Europe (71%) and America
(54%) but the regression did not select the factor group. Why not? The answer to this
question will probably found again by cross-tabulating it against status (see Table 12).
This crossing shows that the preference for allí existed indiscriminately among the
elites settled both in America (79%) and in Europe (75%) (0.68; 76%). Ultimately, the

6 Discussion
Table 13 summarises the incidence of the extralinguistic factors considered in
analysing three linguistic variables at diﬀerent moments between the Golden Age
period and early modern Spanish.
The data in the table reveal some notable diﬀerences between the three
variables. As we have seen, creer que + complement clause was always the majority
form in Spanish syntax, although, during the Golden Age period, a considerable
degree of variation occurred in alternating with elisions (creer Ø). In fact, in the 16th
and 17th centuries, a signiﬁcant social and stylistic correlation was observed. The
instances of creer que in the most distant contexts by the elites always exceeded those
of other people, and the same sociolectal distribution is observed in the closer and
more personal settings, with the diﬀerence that the uses of this variant were now
signiﬁcantly lower in all sociolects. However, this socio-stylistic proﬁle disappeared

in the 18th century, when the zero variant became weaker. The old correlations left
only a few traces in the genderlect variation, with women as the leaders in the use of
the prestige variant, although the imbalances in the corpus between male and female
speech samples mean that we have to be cautious regarding the true incidence of this
factor. In contrast, in the century of the Enlightenment, a new extralinguistic
constraint seems to take over: the European varieties took the lead in the general-
isation of the prestige variant, while in America, the elisions were still notable, even
though the grammar remained essentially the same.
In contrast to the uses of creer que, the relative pronoun quienes was very much
in the minority until well into the 17th century, without any signs of socio-stylistic
variation until then. As of the second half of that century, however, an abrupt change
boosted the use of this innovative form rather than the invariable and traditional
quien. This change was ﬁrst driven by the lower ranks but faced resistance from the
social elites. However, from the mid-18th century onwards, in line with the almost
categorical spread of the new variant, these sociolectal diﬀerences were neutralised
entirely. In short, we seem to deal with a quick change, with signiﬁcant sociolectal
and stylistic implications at that point, which were nevertheless soon to be
abandoned once the innovative variant became (almost) deﬁnitive.
Although not in the same proportion as quienes, the demonstrative adverb allí
was also the minority form throughout the 16th century, with no signs of
socio-stylistic variation. However, things changed radically in the 18th century, with
a signiﬁcant increase in use. Likewise, allí displayed social and stylistic variation in
this period, but with a diﬀerent sense to what is observed in the other two variables.
Hence, if in the stage of expansion of quienes the diﬀusion of the relative pronoun
was produced above by the lower-middle sectors of society and in close communi-
cative settings, the generalisation of allí pointed in the opposite direction, that is,
towards a change driven by the elites, and with a particular emphasis on the
more distant registers. These diﬀerences are also evident in comparison with creer
+ complement clause, since, in this case, the consolidation of the que variant in the
18th century diluted the social and stylistic constraints that were prevalent in the
Golden Age period. Even so, both creer que and allí showed parallelism in their
dialectal diﬀusion during early modern Spanish: they expanded more rapidly in the
European varieties than in the American ones.11
Of the extralinguistic factor groups considered in this study, the social status
appears to be the most crucial since, at some point, it independently conditioned the
11 The conservativeness of the American varieties in two of the three linguistic changes seems to
support the “colonial lag” hypothesis, that is, that the colonial varieties of a language change less than
the variety spoken in the mother country (Nevalainen 2006). However, much more data of this kind
would be needed to conﬁrm the hypothesis more precisely in the history of Spanish.

three phenomena analysed. Nevertheless, we have seen that the direction of eﬀect of
this conditioning varied substantially depending on several parameters, such as
the speed and robustness of changes, their typology, the vitality of the alternative
variants or the role played by the structural constraints governing the variation.
Thus, in the paradigm of relative pronouns, we witness an abrupt increase of the
novel variant, quienes, by the middle of the 17th century. Nevertheless, this new form
was soon to become almost categorical, relegating the traditional and invariable
quien to sporadic uses. In the ﬁrst stages, the leading role of the lower sociolects can
be seen in this change, which the elites resisted for some time. Nonetheless, as the
new variant became ﬁrmly established by the mid-18th century, these sociolectal
diﬀerences disappeared.
What is so special about a linguistic change like this taking place in a few decades
and with its back turned, initially, to the dominant classes? In our view, this fact may
be related to the analogical nature of the change, which led to the creation of a
functional variant similar to those observed in other paradigms of grammar, where
the singular and the plural have diﬀerent forms (alguno vs. algunos ‘one vs. some’;
esta vs. estas ‘this vs. these’), etc. These analogical changes were akin to vernacular
speech, so it is not surprising that they may have been initially promoted by the
lower-middle classes, although they were later joined by the elites, given the new
variant’s high functional value.
However, the picture was diﬀerent from other forms that, even if they ended up
imposing themselves on their alternative variants, did not do so at the same rate or
with the same strength, and they did not respond to the typology of analogical change
we have just outlined. This occurred with the progress of allí in the paradigm of the
demonstrative pronouns of distance in early modern Spanish. In this case, in which
the alternative variant (allá) still showed signs of a certain vitality (especially in the
American varieties), the force driving the changes was the elites, who left the rest of
society behind, as opposed to the absence of sociolectal correlations in Golden Age
Spanish, when allí was in the minority. What occurred with creer (que) + complement
clause was also diﬀerent. Although we already ﬁnd evidence of the alternation
between the full and the elided forms in the mediaeval period, creer que was always
in the majority, even if its primacy was seriously aﬀected by the impetus of the
elisions in Golden Age Spanish. In this period, however, the elites acted as a retaining
wall against these zero forms (with notable exceptions in some idiolects, as revealed
by the letters of Saint Teresa de Jesús), preventing the consolidation of a change from
below that, by the 18th century, had been completely deactivated.
The diﬀerent proﬁles displayed by the three variables in the transition from
classical to early modern Spanish also show some correlations with the structural
forces governing the variation in each case. Thus, the particular rate at which the
analogical pronoun quienes spread runs parallel to an apparent anarchic internal

variation conditioned by diﬀerent constraints in each period, with no continuity
between them. It is just the opposite to the expansion of allí over allá, which, despite
the notable diﬀerences in frequency between Golden Age and early modern Spanish,
always respond to similar internal conditioning. Finally, on this scale, creer (que)
+ complement clause holds an intermediate position, keeping some structural
constraints over time and restructuring others.
7 Conclusions
In the preceding pages, we have reviewed three examples of variation and change in
two critical moments in Spanish language history: the Golden Age period and early
modern Spanish during the 18th century. Some of them were to become deﬁnitively
consolidated in the language, as occurred with the categorical substitution of the
invariable quien by the analogical quienes among the relative clauses with an
animate antecedent. The same can be said of the (almost) deﬁnitive success of the
syntactic variant creer que + complement clause, to the detriment of the forms with
no complementiser (creer Ø), which are currently restricted to speciﬁc formal
registers and sporadic uses. However, it is not the case of the expansion of allí at the
expense of allá, since the latter is still widespread in Spanish, especially in many
American varieties.
Using the tools of variationism and with the aid of a corpus composed entirely
of egodocuments, the quantitative analysis reveals a unique sociolinguistic proﬁle of
each variable in the transition period analysed. We have also veriﬁed that this proﬁle
is related to some parameters such as the rate and intensity of the change, its
typology or the linguistic constraints that operate in each case. Hence, the spread of
analogical quienes took place as a consequence of an abrupt change from below, in
which all the structural constraints were blown aside and, as a result, the new
variant became ﬁrmly installed. The opposite occurred with the expansion of allí
versus allá, which gained particular momentum in the 18th century, this time at
the behest of the social elites, although with the same structural constraints as in
previous times. Finally, creer que + complement clause was to corner its competitor
(creer Ø) more and more in modern Spanish, with some changes in the internal
grammar and the neutralisation of the sociolectal diﬀerences that governed it in the
Golden Age period.
In short, both creer que and quienes or allí were to end up becoming the prestige
variants – and in some cases, almost the only ones – in their respective paradigms.
However, the processes that led to the generalisation of these forms could not have
been more diﬀerent.

From a methodological point of view, we believe that the present study also has
some exciting implications for Spanish historical corpus linguistics. On the one hand,
in line with what has been observed in the diachronic research on English and other
European languages in recent times, it conﬁrms the usefulness of corpora composed
of texts close to the pole of communicative immediacy, and especially of private
letters, as a means of approaching the Spanish vernacular of past times. For the sake
of argument, some of the distributions found in the analysis of these variables diﬀer
from previous accounts based on more formal texts (literary, historiographic, legal,
etc.) on which the diachronic study of Spanish has traditionally relied. For example,
our data on the diﬀusion of the elided forms of creer Ø in the Golden Age period
contrast with the more modest ﬁgures found in these other discursive traditions,
thus contradicting the minority condition pointed out to date in the literature. On the
other hand, applying the principles and methods of linguistic variationism and the
comparative perspective also proves to be a handy tool for unravelling the factors
that have constrained linguistic variation and change in the past.
