The Importance of Narrative and Intuitive  
Thought in Navigating Our Realities
Valerie van Mulukom and Micia de Wet
Stephen Asma presents an alternative model of 
mind, “mythopoetic cognition” (MC). We 
applaud Asma’s Herculean effort in bringing 
together this many ideas—with considerable 
breadth and depth—in a single article, and 
wholeheartedly agree that the importance and 
adaptiveness of “nonrational” cognition are often 
rendered invisible in post-Enlightenment 
(“disenchanted”) perspectives. We do believe, 
however, that some additional nuance is 
required. 
Narrative Thought and Social Realities
The distinction between Asma’s “indicative” and 
“imperative” modes of mind is not new, as he 
also mentions: another, similar distinction was 
previously made between “paradigmatic” (indic-
ative) and “narrative” (imperative) thought by 
Jerome Bruner (1986): Paradigmatic thought is 
a formal system of description and explanation, 
organizing thought through abstract categoriza-
tion and conceptualization. Narrative thought, 
on the other hand, deals with “human or 
humanlike intention and action and the vicissi-
tudes and consequences that mark their course” 
(Bruner 1986, 13), and organizes thought by 
“story devices.” These two modes of thought 
operate by their own principles and aims, and 
are complementary rather than reducible to each 
other. 
The paradigmatic mode of thinking seeks to 
explain relationships between sets of observable 
variables, thus providing causal explanations 
about “natural” reality (we can call this “objective 
truth”), whereas the narrative mode of thought 
seeks to understand relationships between indi-
viduals, thus providing meaningful explanations 
about social reality (we can call this “subjective 
truth”) (Brendel 2000). This is not to downplay 
the aim of narrative thought: Subjective truth is 
still a truth, in the same way that social realities 
are real. It matters whether someone is consid-
ered a king or queen, even if there is nothing in 
the natural world that scientifically demonstrates 
this (e.g., “royal blood”), and belief in gods and 
other supernatural beings has similarly signifi-
cantly exerted shaping force on human evolution 
(van Mulukom 2019). However, the different 
aims mean that the two modes cannot be 
rendered equal, and their merits not judged by 
the same criteria: we suggest that there may be a 
conflation as to which reality needs to be 
explained, and that an epistemology of the 
natural world is better served by paradigmatic or 
indicative thought, whereas an epistemology of 
the social world is best served by narrative or 
imperative thought. 
Thus, we resist the notion that the natural 
world is inherently intentional or teleological, 
and that instead intentionality occurs when 
other agents are involved (whether human or 
animal), but not beyond that. Considering that 
human procreation is inevitably tied up with 
social relationships—after all, it takes two to 
tango—it may appear that imperative episte-
mology is superior to indicative epistemology 
when it comes to human survival. However, we 
resist the more extreme notion that indicative 
thought is “neither natural nor necessary,” as

Asma puts it. We don’t believe that earlier devel-
opments are more “natural” than others (e.g., 
lactose intolerance is not more natural than being 
able to drink cow’s milk), or more necessary. 
Moreover, the evolution of indicative thought 
has allowed culture and technology to expand at 
a tremendous rate, and has ultimately contrib-
uted enormously, via culture and technology, to 
the survival of the human species—though we 
concur that this development may also have 
contributed to the prestige of indicative thought 
in the Western world (Henrich 2020).
The Vilification of Intuitive Thought
It is clear that nonrational thinking is increas-
ingly vilified in the West, whether through its 
educational systems (van Mulukom 2018) or its 
researchers (van Mulukom 2017). This means 
that it now has to be defended that “[i]ndicative 
descriptive knowledge is not intrinsically or 
always adaptively superior,” in Asma’s words.  
A similar bias against nonrational cognition is 
evident in the literature on analytical and intui-
tive thinking, which positions rational, logical 
thinking against emotional, holistic thinking 
(Evans 2008). For example, one of the literature’s 
most common and important measures, the 
Cognitive Reflection Test (Frederick 2005), 
determines analytical and intuitive thinking 
through correct and incorrect answers to mathe-
matical puzzles, respectively. We suggest that 
there is a persistent indicative understanding of 
an imperative phenomenon (intuitive thinking). 
As a corrective, we need to appreciate both as valid 
ways of thinking, which can occur simultaneously 
(e.g., in magical and naturalistic explanations).
We must be careful not to swing the 
pendulum too far the other way either: 
Imperative or intuitive thinking is not necessarily 
superior either. For instance, imperative/intuitive 
thinking is associated with more cognitive biases 
than indicative/analytical thinking, such as the 
bandwagon bias, which refers to the tendency to 
agree with something because everyone else is 
saying it, or prestige bias, which refers to the 
tendency to agree with something because a pres-
tigious individual says it. However, aim matters 
here too: If the aim is to make a decision based 
on empirical facts, these biases can lead one 
astray; but if the aim of the decision-making is 
social—that is, to create and/or maintain rela-
tionships—then such “biases”—following 
others—can undoubtedly lead to a successful 
outcome. 
The lack of understanding of the value of 
mythopoesis, and the reduction of it to 
conspiracy or (equally dismissed) magical beliefs 
in a Western narrative, is tragic. Its consequences 
can be dire, as illustrated by legislations to 
remove arts subjects in schools in favor of scien-
tific ones, forgetting that meaning-making is as 
important as fact-generation. Symbolic systems, 
emerged from the organization and projection 
of bodily feeling states, do not just describe 
(label, organize, model) the world but impor-
tantly also inspire us and motivate us, something 
which is particularly clear in the arts (van 
Mulukom 2021a). However, we do maintain 
that representation (not necessarily proposi-
tional) in the form of simulation underlies these 
symbolic expressions (van Mulukom and Clasen 
2021), and that simulation as a system supports 
the various functions of imagination, including 
Theory of Mind (van Mulukom 2020). 
Emotions, Motivation, and Predictive Processing
Emotions are affective states differing in arousal 
(from low to high) and valence (unpleasant to 
pleasant) (Barrett 2017). The interoceptive expe-
riences that we call emotions are interpretations 
of bodily signals which tell the individual to pay 
attention to something. While there is no 
universality in identified emotions and their 
labels, we argue that this does not mean that the 
interoceptive experience underlying them 
requires higher conceptual cognition to be felt. 
Emotions signal salience and induce motivation 
(to approach or avoid). By extension, rather than 
calling the amygdala a brain region preoccupied 
with emotion, it can be called a salience detector

(Cunningham and Brosch 2012)—it just so 
happens that fear is a highly salient and signifi-
cant emotion. Motivations are important 
because they “get the job done,” as Asma says, 
which may be another reason why indigenous 
knowledge—imbued with emotion—and its 
transmission may be so important (cf. Alcorta 
and Sosis 2005), and indeed superior in specific, 
local contexts. In this regard, a probabilistic, 
generalizable explanations may be of less use 
than specific, unique perspectives (Brendel 
2000). This underlines the context-specific, 
pragmatic usefulness or appropriateness, and 
indeed adaptiveness, of imperative knowledge. 
Nonetheless, we suggest that a predictive 
processing framework can be used in conjunc-
tion with the MC model, even as a statistical 
probability calculation. We argue that priors can 
be established through imperative processing as 
much as indicative processing (van Mulukom 
and Lang forthcoming). Indeed, this is what 
makes imperative thought so important yet 
underappreciated: imperative narratives shape 
not only how we interpret the world but also 
perceive it (Schjoedt et al. 2013; van Mulukom 
2020). Such narrative structures or mythopoetic 
templates exist in a Western context too, such as 
the Hero’s Journey (Campbell 1949). Narratives 
work with and through characters (social 
worlds), not only with plot (predictions) and 
plot twists (prediction errors).
However, we suggest that the merger Asma 
presents between predictive processing and 
embodied cognition may benefit from  
more nuanced contextualization; overlaps of 
predictive frameworks with embodied cognition 
disguise fundamental theoretical differences and 
disagreements (Bruineberg, Kiverstein, and 
Rietveld 2018). For instance, the predictive 
coding and processing frameworks rely on infer-
ence and representation, which cannot survive 
in enactive contexts of embodiment (Hutto and 
Myin 2018; Gallagher and Allen 2018). 
In the same vein, imagination may be high-
lighted as an active embodied cognitive facility 
beyond the default mode network; concerns for 
MC may be better served within psychology and 
anthropology than neuroscience. The story 
unveils itself between people in social narratives; 
the power of myth does not reside in objective 
truth, but rather, in its value to affectively mobi-
lize people through its narrative (Armstrong 
2004). Indicative, disembodied, and individual 
understandings of the mind and imagination 
would profit from embodied, narrative, and 
social understandings, and fortunately a trend 
towards this is gradually appearing (van 
Mulukom 2021b).
Conclusions
Imaginative cognition is undervalued and 
under-researched. We commend the mythopo-
etic cognition model, albeit whilst disagreeing 
with some of its implications: We argue that the 
different modes of thinking have different aims. 
Indicative processing is for factual understand-
ings of natural reality; imperative processing for 
meaningful understandings of social reality. Thus 
the function of cognition is to motivate but also 
to inform, and both functions are adaptive. 
Overall we believe that this is a timely model in 
the cognitive science of imagination and imagi-
native culture.
