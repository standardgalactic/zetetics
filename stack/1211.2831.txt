A nonlinear Wightman ﬁeld is taken to be a nonlinear map from a linear space of test
functions to a linear space of Hilbert space operators, with inessential modiﬁcations to other
axioms only to the extent dictated by the introduction of nonlinearity. Two approaches to
nonlinear quantum ﬁelds are constructed and discussed, the ﬁrst of which, starting from
Lagrangian QFT, oﬀers a fresh perspective on renormalization, while the second, starting
from linear Wightman ﬁelds, provides an extensive range of well-deﬁned nonlinear theories.

INTRODUCTION
The reconciliation of the mathematically coherent Wightman axioms with the empirically suc-
cessful Lagrangian and related approaches to interacting quantum ﬁeld theory is a longstanding
problem [1, 2].
The nature of the mismatch between interacting quantum ﬁelds such as QED
and the Standard Model of particle physics and the Wightman axioms is not clear, however it
appears that the introduction of products of distributions in Lagrangian QFT is one heart of the
diﬃculty. Because Lagrangian QFT introduces nonlinear interaction terms into the Lagrangian
without changing the linearity of the underlying Hilbert space, we are motivated to consider what
similar forms of nonlinearity might be introduced into the Wightman or Haag-Kastler axioms.
Real-space renormalization also motivates a nonlinear structure because processes that are used
to construct higher-level block variables, such as majority rule and decimation, are not in general
expressible as weighted averages of lower-level block variables.
The postulate that a Wightman ﬁeld ˆφ(x) is an operator-valued distribution, so that the oper-
ators of the theory are obtained by linear “smearing”, for a well-behaved linear space S of “test”
functions,
ˆφ : S →A; f 7→ˆφf =
Z
ˆφ(x)f(x)d4x,
(1)
has hitherto not been questioned in the literature. Our point of departure will be to take ˆξ : f 7→ˆξf,
for a suitably well-behaved linear space of test functions, to be a nonlinear functional of the test
functions, so that in general ˆξf+g ̸= ˆξf + ˆξg and ˆξλf ̸= λˆξf, essentially denying the linearity that is
implied by Eq. (1). Nonetheless, the action of the ∗-algebra of operators on Hilbert space vectors
is taken to be linear, (ˆξf + ˆξg) |ψ⟩= ˆξf |ψ⟩+ ˆξg |ψ⟩and (λˆξf) |ψ⟩= ˆξf(λ |ψ⟩), and we will retain
the usual Born rule construction of expected values, of probabilities, and of correlations that is
common to all quantum theory —and their use to model the statistics of multiple experimental
datasets— and the converse GNS-construction of a Hilbert space from the expected values that
are generated by a state over a ∗-algebra of operators [3, §III.2]. This “Born-GNS” linearity is
necessary, as in Lagrangian QFT, so that quantum theory generates probabilities that satisfy the
Kolmogorov axioms of probability, however the linearity we relinquish has no comparable necessity.

In the construction introduced in Section IV, we will be able to preserve the conditions that are
satisﬁed by a Wightman ﬁeld —Cluster Decomposition, Relativistic Transformation, Spectrum,
Hermiticity, Local Commutativity, and Positive Deﬁniteness—, and that are required of the Vac-
uum Expectation Values (VEVs) to allow the use of the Wightman reconstruction theorem to
construct a Wightman ﬁeld [4, §3-4], in forms that are appropriate for nonlinear Wightman ﬁelds.
It is of course possible to question other postulates.
Numerous ways to break the Lorentz
invariance of the dynamics, both at very large distances and at very short distances, have been
proposed, however we here suppose the dynamics to be Lorentz invariant, on a Minkowski space
background, ruling out for our purposes, in particular, the concerns of quantum ﬁeld theory in
curved space-time and of quantum gravity. Streater [5, §3.4] discusses a number of ways in which
the Wightman axioms have been questioned, but there is no introduction of nonlinearity of the
form proposed here, nor either is there in the more recent discussions mentioned above [1, 2]. The
equivalent Haag-Kastler axiom is the additivity property, which requires that the operator algebra
associated with two regions of space-time is generated by the operator algebras associated with the
two independent regions [3, §III.1], however we will work here more concretely with (nonlinear)
Wightman ﬁelds. From the direction of Lagrangian QFT, the mathematics has somewhat improved
with the introduction of a Hopf algebraic approach to Feynman diagrams [6], however, again, we
prefer here to begin with Wightman ﬁelds.
We will introduce two very diﬀerent nonlinear constructions, one, non-rigorous, that approxi-
mately follows and is motivated by the method that is used by Lagrangian QFT to construct an
interacting quantum ﬁeld, in Section III, and another, in Section IV, that modiﬁes the free ﬁeld
∗-algebra of creation and annihilation operators. Section II describes some standard interacting
QFT, then presents the same material in a way that motivates the construction in Section III.

SOME STANDARD QUANTUM FIELD THEORY
The direct textbook way to construct an interacting scalar quantum ﬁeld is to introduce a
formal time-dependent transformation of a free quantum ﬁeld ˆφ(x) [7, §6-1-1],
ˆξ(x) = ˆU−1(x0)ˆφ(x) ˆU(x0)
where ˆU(τ) = T

where ˆH(y) is a local operator, constructed as a sum of normal-ordered products of ˆφ(y) and its
derivatives.
A standard ﬁrst step is a heuristic derivation of the time-ordered VEVs for the interacting ﬁeld,
⟨0| T

which in turn allows the construction of Feynman integrals and the corresponding Feynman dia-
grams. As well as the formal nature of this construction, also the time-ordering of the left-hand side
of this equation compromises its connection to the Wightman axioms, for which one foundation is

a set of non-time-ordered VEVs that are distributions and that satisfy six sets of Conditions —
Cluster Decomposition, Relativistic Transformation, Spectrum, Hermiticity, Local Commutativity,
and Positive Deﬁniteness—, which would allow the use of the Wightman reconstruction theorem
to construct a Wightman ﬁeld.
A standard alternative is to construct an S-matrix, which time-evolves vector-valued distri-
butions such as ˆφ(x1) · · · ˆφ(xn)|0⟩(or the equivalent in wave-number coordinates), which form
an improper basis for the free ﬁeld Hilbert space of initial states, using the formal construction

as the evolution operator (introducing an idealization of inﬁnite time-separation

a ﬁnal state, a vector in a Hilbert space that is taken to be unitarily equivalent to the free ﬁeld
Hilbert space of initial states. We obtain constructions such as

a Wightman ﬁeld.
Neither the time-ordered VEVs construction nor the S-matrix construction is well-deﬁned, be-
cause, at least, the integral

ˆH(y)d4y does not exist, however regularization and renormalization

A.
A diﬀerent construction
Here we directly construct non-time-ordered VEVs for the interacting quantum ﬁeld by noting
that the components of ˆU(x0) that are space-like separated from x commute with ˆφ(x), and be-
cause of time-ordering those components cancel with the time-reversed components of the inverse
ˆU−1(x0), so that the interacting ﬁeld ˆξ(x) can also be written Lorentz invariantly as
ˆξ(x) = T†h
e−i ˆL(x)i
ˆφ(x)T

where ˆL(x) =

(5)
and ▲(x) = {y : (x −y)2 ≥0 and x0 > y0} is the region of space-time that is light-like or time-like
separated from and earlier than x. Furthermore, the adjoint action of ˆφ(x) on a time-ordered
expression is a derivation, because time-ordering ensures commutativity, so that, taking a quartic
scalar interaction with Hamiltonian density λ

where the restriction to the backward light-cone ▲(x) is equivalent to replacing the propagator
i∆(x−z) by −iGret(x−z), as we see from Eq. (6). Insofar as we can take : ˆφ3(z): formally to be an
inﬁnite multiple of ˆφ(z) subtracted from ˆφ3(z), we can take : ˆξ3(z): formally to be the same inﬁnite
multiple of ˆξ(z) subtracted from ˆξ3(z).
ˆφ(x) satisﬁes the homogeneous Klein-Gordon equation,
(□+ m2)ˆφ(x) = 0, and Gret(x −z) satisﬁes (□+ m2)Gret(x −z) = δ4(x −z), so, applying the
operator (□+ m2) to the last line of Eq. (7), ˆξ(x) satisﬁes the nonlinear diﬀerential equation
(□+ m2)ˆξ(x) + λ
3! : ˆξ3(x): = 0.
(8)
The above construction shows that, apart from the mathematical necessity to regularize and renor-
malize, to construct an interacting ﬁeld we may replace ˆφ(x) at a point by a complex of operators
at points of the backward light-cone of x, constructed using the propagator Gret(x −z).
Once we have constructed ˆξ(x) as a functional of ˆφ(z), using Gret(x−z) to propagate to all points
in the backward light-cone, we may use Wick’s theorem [7, §4-2] formally and the positive frequency
propagator i˜∆+(k) = 2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0) to put the complex of operators that is associated with
▲(x) into normal-ordered form,

ments and after renormalization must be such that VEVs are ﬁnite, are determined by whatever
Hamiltonian we use for the interacting theory, and are zero unless every x −yi that is a parameter
of Gn(x −y1, ..., x −yn) is in or on the forward light-cone. Having constructed the operator ˆξ(x)

curved lines, which are non-zero for any space-time separation. Time increases from bottom to top, but the

in normal-ordered form, the formal Wick contraction of a product ˆξ(x1)ˆξ(x2) of two such opera-
tors yields a normal-ordered operator that is a complex of operators associated with the backward
light-cones both of x1 and of x2, which in principle determines the commutation relations for the
interacting ﬁeld, again, however, up to regularization and renormalization. To construct n-point
VEVs, we again may use Wick’s theorem and the positive frequency propagator, now between the
inﬁnite complexes of operators that are associated with the n backward light-cones of the original n
points. This contrasts with the time-ordered VEVs of Eq. (3), which use only the Feynman propa-
gator; and with the S-matrix construction of Eq. (4), which uses the positive frequency propagator
whenever one of a pair of operators is associated with the initial or ﬁnal state vectors, because the
initial and ﬁnal state vectors are not within the scope of the time-ordering, and uses the Feynman
propagator between all pairs of points that occur within the time-ordering. Nonetheless, all three
constructions are quite direct consequences of Eq. (2).
The distinction between the two propagators i∆+(x) and Gret(x), the ﬁrst being conﬁned to the
forward light-cone in wave-number space and the second being conﬁned to the forward light-cone
in real space, gives an alternative to conventional discussions of virtual particles, in that we have
used the virtual propagator Gret(x) to construct an interacting ﬁeld operator as a complex of free
ﬁeld operators that are conﬁned to the backward light-cone. The form of Eq. (7) also suggests
a form of diagram diﬀerent from that of Feynman diagrams, in which we distinguish between the
propagators i∆+(x) and Gret(x) in the integrals that arise. Some examples are given in Fig. 1. We
may also construct graphs, as in Fig. 2, that contribute to the terms that arise in Eq. (9). This
alternative discussion does not undermine conventional discussions or computations, but it provides
an alternative that takes an interacting ﬁeld operator ˆξ(x) to be associated with free ﬁeld operators
in the backward light-cone of x, instead of taking a particle to be surrounded by a sea of virtual
particles at the same time. This approach is possible insofar as we take the structure of quantum
ﬁeld theory to be a single Hilbert space that is associated with 4-dimensional space-time, which is
standard for Wightman ﬁelds, instead of the alternative, in which we take the structure to be a set
of Hilbert spaces that are individually associated with a phase space at a given time, with unitary
evolution acting on a given Hilbert space to produce Hilbert spaces associated with diﬀerent times.
Although standard discussions of Lagrangian QFT begin with Hilbert spaces associated with phase
spaces, calculations in Lagrangian QFT are compatible with either structure.
It is essential that time-ordering ensures that the complexes of operators in the backward light-
cones of two space-like separated points do not modify the commutativity of the interacting ﬁeld

at space-like separation, because the product ˆξ(x)ˆξ(y) can be written as
ˆU−1(x0)ˆφ(x) ˆU(x0) ˆU−1(y0)ˆφ(y) ˆU(y0) = ˆU−1(y0) ˆU(y0) ˆU−1(x0)ˆφ(x) ˆU(x0) ˆU−1(y0)ˆφ(y) ˆU(y0)
= ˆU−1(y0) ˆU−1(x0, y0)ˆφ(x) ˆU(x0, y0)ˆφ(y) ˆU(y0).
(10)
When x and y are space-like separated, we can note that there is a choice of time coordinates in
which x0 = y0, ˆU(x0, y0) = ˆU(x0) ˆU−1(y0) = 1, or we can, alternatively, note that for arbitrary
time coordinates ˆU−1(x0, y0)ˆφ(x) ˆU(x0, y0) replaces ˆφ(x) by a complex of free ﬁeld operators at
points of the backward light-cone at x that are all at space-like separation from y. Hence, as for
the free ﬁeld ˆφ(x), ˆξ(x) satisﬁes [ˆξ(x), ˆξ(y)] = 0 when x and y are space-like separated. It is taken
to be a fundamental constraint on renormalization that commutativity of the renormalized ﬁeld at
space-like separation is preserved.
Regularization and renormalization of this construction is as much a problem as it is for the
conventional construction of time-ordered VEVs and of the S-matrix, however what we are con-
structing is somewhat clearer, and closer to the Wightman axioms in character, because we have
reduced some of the distraction introduced by time-ordering.
III.
A FIRST NONLINEAR CONSTRUCTION
As well as “smearing” with a test function, we may also take some motivation from signal
analysis to construct a convolution of a quantum ﬁeld with a smooth window function w(·),
ˆφw(x) = [ˆφ ⋆w](x) =
Z
ˆφ(x −y)w(y)d4y =
Z
ˆφ(y)w(x −y)d4y,
(11)
which for the free ﬁeld satisﬁes the linear diﬀerential equation (□+ m2)ˆφw(x) = 0 for any window
function and for which we have the commutation relations [ˆφw1(x), ˆφw2(y)] = [w1⋆i∆⋆w(−)
2
](x−y),
where w(−)(z) = w(−z).
We could equally well present this convolution in terms of smearing
as ˆφw(x) = ˆφwx, where we deﬁne the indexed set of test functions wx as wx(y) = w(x −y),
however particle physics has become something of an extreme exercise in processing large numbers
of electronic signals, where window functions are at least as familiar as test functions.
The process of smearing and of convolution is fundamental to the renormalization group, as
described by Wilson and Kogut, for example,
“The [ﬁrst] basic idea [of the renormalization group] is the same as in hydrodynam-
ics. In hydrodynamics one introduces new variables such as the density ρ(x) which
represents an average over the original microscopic degrees of freedom.” [8, p. 79]

7
It is supposed here that such a smeared classical density ρ(x) ought to be indexed by a descrip-
tion of the averaging process, for which in the linear case we might choose a window function w,
giving us ρw(x). The process of real-space renormalization, furthermore, introduces a hierarchy of
smeared observables, in which successive levels are constructed from the level below, and operators
associated with successive levels of the hierarchy are taken to satisfy diﬀerent equations. The prac-
tice is to construct successive levels, typically nonlinearly, by applying a single process repeatedly,
so that successive smeared observables may be indexed by a single scale, however each level may
in principle be an arbitrary nonlinear functional of the levels below. We here take an operator
ˆξw(x) to be a nonlinear functional of w, but we will discuss only marginally how ˆξw(x) might be
obtained from other ˆξw′(x), ..., instead focusing abstractly on the VEVs that are obtained for a
given window function.
A deformation that follows the construction of Section II A requires an interacting quantum
ﬁeld ˆξw(x) to satisfy a nonlinear diﬀerential equation that depends on the window function, such
as, for the φ4 potential,
(□+ m2)ˆξw(x) + λ[w]
3!

ˆξw(x)3 −3µ[w]ˆξw(x)

= 0,
(12)
where the interaction functionals λ[w] and µ[w] should be manifestly Poincar´e invariant and the
term −3µ[w]ˆξw(x) has a similar eﬀect to that of normal-ordering. Given this covariant construction,
which accords with the usual idea that the Lagrangian changes as we consider diﬀerent renormal-
ization scales, ˆξw(x) in general cannot be a linear functional of wx. Note that a governing idea
of eﬀective ﬁeld theory is that in principle all possible interaction terms that are consistent with
experimentally observed symmetries should be present in such a diﬀerential equation for an eﬀec-
tive observable, not just the two interaction terms given in Eq. (12), and that all the interaction
strengths should be functions of the details of the construction of the eﬀective observables [9, §8
and refs. therein], so that for an eﬀective ﬁeld theory we might work with

(15)
When w(·) is not close to the Dirac δ-function, there is no guarantee that ˆξw(x) commutes with
ˆξw(y) when x and y are space-like separated enough to make the supports of wx and wy space-like
separated, because we cannot use Eq. (10), but when w(·) approaches the Dirac δ-function, Eq. (12)
approaches the conventional Eq. (8), with potentially inﬁnite λ[w] and µ[w], and ˆξw(x) approaches
the ˆξ(x) of Eq. (5). The functional dependence of λ[w] and of other interaction constants can
be taken to be an explicit way to control the mathematics of regularization and renormalization,

8
with the inﬁnite-dimensional dependence on w(·) replacing the usual dependence on the single-
dimensional renormalization scale; diﬀerent functional properties of λ[w] can be used to tune the
variation of VEVs for diﬀerent choices of w, and modiﬁcation of the functional dependence of
the mass term µ[w] may also be useful. In these terms, real-space renormalization determines
an operator-valued function ˆξw as a functional of ˆξS1[w], ˆξS2[w], ..., where S1[w], S2[w], ...
are
functionals of w; for example, but with more general constructions possible,

which in general will not be reversible, in such a way that ˆξw′(x) satisﬁes a Poincar´e covariant
equation of the same structure as ˆξw(x), but with (a preferably ﬁnite number of) coeﬃcients λj[w′]
replacing λj[w]. One example of an increase in generality is for the integral to be restricted only to
the causal completion, Supp(Si[w]zi) ⊂Supp(wx)′′ ⊇Supp(wx). The density ρwx(z1, z2, ...) must
be a translation and Lorentz covariant functional of wx, which could be taken, as for straightforward
blocking, to be zero except for zi on a lattice of points, but we could also allow ρwx(z1, z2, ...) to be
continuous; similarly, as eﬀective models we might take ˆξw(x) to be deﬁned only for x on a lattice
of points without concern at the consequent lack of translation invariance, but we could also allow
ˆξw(x) to be deﬁned for any x. There is a tacit understanding that the momentum space forms
of regularization and renormalization that are used in quantum ﬁeld theory are more-or-less sui
generis with real-space renormalization, however an attempt to place subtle analytic approaches
such as dimensional regularization accurately in such a relationship is taken to be beyond the scope
of this paper.
The mathematics of renormalization is often motivated in language that is reminiscent of that
of signal processing; for a recent example among many,
“the natural description of physics generally changes with the scale at which obser-
vations are made. Crudely speaking, this is no more high-minded a statement than
saying that the world around us looks rather diﬀerent when viewed through a mi-
croscope. More precisely, our parametrization of some system in terms of both the
degrees of freedom and an action specifying how they interact generally change with
scale.” [10, p. 178]
Such a discussion may be subsumed by detailed engineering models that introduce diﬀerent choices
of window functions both for measurements and for preparations to model the responses of dif-
ferent measurement apparatuses to diﬀerent preparation apparatuses.
The suggestion here —
unelaborated because, although this and the previous section are partly intended to establish some
connection with familiar topics, the intended main subject of this paper is contained in Section
IV— is that in principle we would work only with window functions that we think appropriate
to model an experiment, avoiding the ad hoc vagueness of a renormalization scale as a single
parameter that determines broad aspects of the model; indeed, sloganizing, if we use a diﬀerent
microscope we use a diﬀerent window function. If we want to use a renormalization scale in a
pragmatic model, we might reasonably take it to be determined by the maximum of the various
characteristic frequencies of the test functions that would be used in a detailed model, so that
specifying a renormalization scale as well as a detailed model of an experiment overdetermines the

present in the detailed model.

NONLINEAR CREATION AND ANNIHILATION ∗-ALGEBRAS
Insofar as we accept that interacting quantum ﬁelds are nonlinear functionals of test functions,
we can introduce rather diﬀerent nonlinear models, grounded in the axioms of Wightman ﬁelds
instead of in the renormalization group, which we pursue in the hope that they might lead to
otherwise inaccessible insight. We begin here by noting that the conventional GNS-construction of
a Fock space that is based on a ∗-algebra of creation operators a†
fi and annihilation operators afi,
for some countable set of test functions {fi}, depends only on the commutator matrix [afi, a†
fj] =
(fi, fj) being a positive semi-deﬁnite matrix, so that ⟨0| af1 · · · afma†
g1 · · · a†
gn |0⟩= δm,nPer [(fi, gj)],
the permanent of the matrix (fi, gj), is a state over the algebra generated by the creation and
annihilation ∗-algebra. For the free ﬁeld, this is ensured by (fi, fj) being a Gram matrix of a
positive semi-deﬁnite inner product (f, g) on the test function space that is diagonal in the wave-
number basis, [a(k), a(k′)†] = (2π)4δ4(k −k′)i˜∆+(k) = (2π)4δ4(k −k′)2πδ(k ·k −m2)θ(k0); the
factor θ(k0) implements the spectrum condition. We also require, for locality for a quantum ﬁeld
ˆξξf = af∗+ a†
f, that [ˆξξf, ˆξξg] = [af∗, a†
g] −[ag∗, a†
f] is zero when f and g have space-like separated
supports, which for the free ﬁeld is satisﬁed by [af∗, a†
g] −[ag∗, a†
f] = (f∗, g) −(g∗, f). The notation
[af, a†
g] = (f, g) refers to either a scalar or a non-scalar ﬁeld, as discussed in Appendix A, but we
will work with scalar ﬁelds, with the extension to non-scalar ﬁelds being partly straightforward.
Extending this construction to the nonlinear case, we may also construct the commutator matrix
[afi, a†
fj] as a positive semi-deﬁnite matrix by introducing Hadamard products such as
[afi, a†
fj] = (fi, fj)1 + (fi, fj)2(fi, fj)3 + (fi, fj)4(fi, fj)5 + ... + (fi, fj)6(fi, fj)7(fi, fj)8 + ..., (17)
for some set of positive semi-deﬁnite inner products (fi, fj)n that satisfy the spectrum condition,
because, crucially for this construction, the Hadamard product (M ◦N)ij = MijNij of positive
semi-deﬁnite matrices is positive semi-deﬁnite [11, p.
141].
We cannot use a matrix product,
P
k MikNkj, in this context because [afi, a†
fj] must be determined by just the two functions fi and
fj.
This construction straightforwardly satisﬁes locality because for each factor (f, g)n, (f∗, g)n =
(g∗, f)n whenever f and g have space-like separated supports.
For the spectrum condition, in
preference to constructing an elaborate notation we rehearse the derivation of the expected value
of the 4-momentum for the lowest order non-vacuum states, using a normalized Hilbert space vector
ˆφgx|0⟩, where we deﬁne translation of a test function implicitly in terms of the Fourier transform as
egx(k) = ˜g(k)e−ik·x. For the linear Wightman scalar ﬁeld, for which ⟨0| ˆφ†
f ˆφg |0⟩= (f, g), we obtain
for the 4-momentum observable
⟨0| ˆφ†

∂xµ ˆφgx |0⟩= i ∂

which lies in or on the forward light-cone for all test functions g; the action of the 4-momentum
operator as a derivation ensures that the spectrum condition is satisﬁed for higher order states.

(2π)4 , (19)
which again lies in or on the forward light-cone for all test functions g; for higher order states, the
4-momentum operator acts as a derivation on the ∗-algebra, as for the linear Wightman ﬁeld case.
This direct approach to the 4-momentum operator in terms of translations makes no assumption
that it can be deﬁned as a functional of the ﬁeld.
A more interesting construction arises if we introduce a set of non-invariant individual positive
semi-deﬁnite inner products that are parameterized by wave-number,
(f, g)[u] =
Z
˜f∗(k)i˜∆+(k −u)˜g(k) d4k
(2π)4 .
(20)
We use these positive semi-deﬁnite inner products to construct, as the simplest ansatz,
[af, a†
g] = (f, g)H =
Z
(f, g)[u](f, g)[λu] ˜H(u) d4u

× H((x1 −y1) + λ(x2 −y2))d4x1d4y1d4x2d4y2,
(21)
which is positive semi-deﬁnite and Lorentz invariant if ˜H(u) is.
We will ﬁnd that we require
λ = −1 to ensure that the spectrum condition is satisﬁed and H(x) = H(−x) to ensure that the
locality condition is satisﬁed. When f and g have space-like separated supports, (x1 −y1) and
(x2 −y2) are always both space-like in Eq. (21), in which case i∆+(x1 −y1) = i∆+(y1 −x1) and
i∆+(x2 −y2) = i∆+(y2 −x2), so that [ˆξξf, ˆξξg] = [af∗, a†
g] −[ag∗, a†
f] is zero when f and g have
space-like separated supports if H(x) = H(−x) for all x, because (x1 −y1) + λ(x2 −y2) may
be either space-like, light-like, or time-like when (x1 −y1) and (x2 −y2) are space-like.
H(x)
in this case is not a distribution in real-space; see [12], for example, from which we may also
show that because ˜H(u) ≥0, H(x) at small separation is a positive multiple of −(x2)−1, for
both massive and massless cases, being always positive for small space-like separation and always
negative for small time-like separation. The introduction of negative frequency or space-like wave-
number components, however, as well as being compatible with locality, is also compatible with
the spectrum condition because, repeating the process introduced in Eq. (18),

(22)
provided λ = −1, because in that case k1 + k2 = k1 −u + k2 + u is in or on the forward light-cone
because k1 −u and k2 +u are in or on the forward light-cone. With this condition satisﬁed, despite
the appearance of intermediate negative frequencies or space-like wave-number components, the

11
Hilbert space vectors nonetheless are always positive frequency. The propagator ˜H(k) is eﬀectively
what may be called a “hidden propagator”, insofar as it modiﬁes the VEVs of the nonlinear
Wightman ﬁeld by mediating a 4-momentum transfer without itself being associated with a ﬁeld
that is measured.
We focus particular attention on the real-space expression for (f, g)H,
(f, g)H =
Z
f∗(x1)i∆+(x1 −y1)g(y1)f∗(x2)i∆+(x2 −y2)g(y2)
× H((x1 −y1) −(x2 −y2))d4x1d4y1d4x2d4y2,
(23)
noting that the hidden propagator factor can be rewritten as H((x1 −x2) −(y1 −y2)). When the
supports of f and g are at large space-like separation (when the VEVs of the linear Wightman
ﬁeld decrease faster than exponentially with increasing separation) we can nonetheless engineer
VEVs of the nonlinear Wightman ﬁeld that are very large by ensuring that terms for which x1 −x2
is very close to y1 −y2 dominate (f, g)H, which we may understand as analogous to a resonance
condition between dipoles. The VEVs nonetheless satisfy cluster decomposition because for any
given local structure for f and g, increasing separation will arbitrarily minimize all VEVs. With
this, we can check oﬀall the conditions that are required to allow the use of the Wightman recon-
struction theorem —Cluster Decomposition, Relativistic Transformation, Spectrum, Hermiticity,
Local Commutativity, and Positive Deﬁniteness—, excepting only, of course, that the VEVs are
not distributions and we take these conditions in their obvious smeared forms. In their smeared
forms, there is enough structure to allow the GNS-construction of a Hilbert space that generates
a Gaussian probability density for every operator ˆξξf.
The construction just given can be generalized to introduce arbitrary numbers of products of
positive semi-deﬁnite inner products (f, g)i[vi], where the vi are arbitrary linear combinations of
4-momenta uj that are contained in hidden propagator factors ˜Hj(uj). The undisplaced positive
semi-deﬁnite inner products (f, g)i may correspond to diﬀerent masses, with positive frequency
propagators Fi(x −y), so that we obtain an expression

(fi, fj){H} is a positive semi-deﬁnite matrix because it is a positively weighted integral of Hadamard
products of positive semi-deﬁnite matrices; locality is satisﬁed if Hj(−x) = Hj(x); and, to satisfy
the spectrum condition, we require that the column sums of the Aij are zero,

, where the masses and the pairwise relationships will
determine a geometrical structure. Given any theory we can add a resonance that can only be
detected when the preparation and measurement test functions satisfy very particular conditions,
but that when those conditions are suﬃciently satisﬁed the resonance will dominate at arbitrary
distances. The range of possibilities is so large that it is clear that we must look for experimentally
motivated symmetries to bring some control and hopefully some tractability. To construct a useful
and veriﬁable theory we will have to take the structure of higher terms in the commutator to be
systematically generated, so that all the propagators Fi(x−y) and Hj(z) contained in (f, g){H} are
taken from a small set and that the overall construction is invariant under appropriate symmetries,
however model worlds are possible in which there is no such systematization or in which the
systematization is broken by spectacular terms.
The deformation of VEVs that is introduced by this construction includes nonlocal modiﬁcations
of correlations at space-like separation that are nonetheless local in the sense that no measurement
incompatibility is introduced at space-like separation, but as always for quantum mechanics it does
not suggest or require a mechanism or an explanation for the nonlocal correlations, it merely intro-
duces models in which there are nonlocal correlations of the kind that this particular mathematical
structure allows, which we may then compare with such nonlocal correlations as appear in experi-
ments. As we saw in subsection II A, interacting Lagrangian QFT introduces a speciﬁc nonlocality
additional to the nonlocality already present in free linear Wightman ﬁelds, as it were by the in-
troduction of free ﬁeld operators everywhere in the backward light-cone of an experiment, which
modiﬁes correlations without modifying measurement compatibility at space-like separation, so an
alternative mathematical structure should equally expect to modify correlations without modifying
measurement compatibility at space-like separation.
We are constructing functionals of two functions, subject to constraints that are only satisﬁed
in the linear case by free quantum ﬁelds, but that are not especially hard to satisfy in the nonlinear
case, so there is a superﬂuity of possible constructions. We mention here the lowest order example
of a way to modify Eq. (20) by the introduction of positive semi-deﬁnite functions of k·u, to give
(f, g)′′[u] =
Z
˜f∗(k)(k·u)2 ˜F(k −u)˜g(k) d4k
(2π)4 ,
(26)
with obvious generalization of the quadratic form (k·u)2 to arbitrary positive polynomials, which
results in a greater contribution to (f, g)′′[u] by components for wave-numbers that are parallel to
u. (f, g)′′[u] is still diagonal in wave-number space and positive semi-deﬁnite, so it can be used to
construct an analogue of Eq. (21),
Z
(f, g)′′[u](f, g)′′[−u] ˜H(u) d4u
(2π)4
=
Z
˜f∗(k1)(k1·u)2 ˜F(k1 −u)˜g(k1) ˜f∗(k2)(k2·u)2 ˜F(k2 + u)˜g(k2) ˜H(u) d4k1

where X,µ is a tensor notation for a ﬁrst-order derivative, etc. This construction modiﬁes the
resonance to be stronger when there are components of f and g at parallel wave-numbers.
Still further elaboration replaces the test functions by Lorentz invariant functionals of the test
functions for which the support is a subset of the causal completion of the original test function,
Supp(S[f]) ⊆Supp(f)′′, and that ensure that the spectrum condition is satisﬁed, for which it is
suﬃcient if Si[f] is translation covariant, Si[fx] = Si[f]x, to give

At simplest, the Si[f] may be arbitrary polynomials or analytic functions in f and f∗that preserve
the vanishing of the test function at inﬁnity, but more elaborate constructions are possible, albeit
they may result in even less tractability.
When we use interacting quantum ﬁelds as models, we typically introduce a list of wave-numbers
{ki} and corresponding widths as a shorthand for a list of test functions {fi(k)} that are more-
or-less narrowly centered on those wave-numbers and that are less-or-more spatially conﬁned. To
model interactions in a nonlinear Wightman ﬁeld formalism, we map these test functions into a
space of operators, which in the case just constructed may use Poincar´e invariant scalar functionals
λi[f] and functionals Ti[f] to give constructions such as, noting that normal-ordering may be deﬁned
exactly as for linear Wightman ﬁelds,
ˆζζf =:
h
λ0[f]+λ1[f]ˆξξT1[f]+λ2[f]ˆξξT2[f]ˆξξT3[f]+λ3[f]ˆξξT4[f]ˆξξT5[f]+ · · · +λ4[f]ˆξξT6[f]ˆξξT7[f]ˆξξT8[f]+ · · ·
i
: ,
(29)
which, we might say ﬁnally, results in non-Gaussian VEVs. For the functionals Ti[f], as for the
Si[f] introduced in Eq. (28), Ti[f] must satisfy Supp(Ti[f]) ⊆Supp(f)′′ and must ensure that the
spectrum condition is satisﬁed. Transformations of the test function f and of the functionals Ti[f]
can transform but cannot in general eliminate the functionals Si[f] used in Eq. (28). The operators
ˆζζf introduced by Eq. (29) are qualitatively comparable to the interacting Lagrangian QFT oper-
ators ˆξf constructed in Eq. (9), insofar as resonances between arbitrary numbers of points within
the supports of the test functions may be mediated by the various propagators and hidden propaga-
tors; there is a diﬀerence that ˆξf is constructed using ˆφ(x) at every point in Supp(f ⋆Gret) instead
of only at every point of Supp(f)′′, however renormalization introduces enough complications and
ˆζζf works in a diﬀerent enough way that empirical comparison is nontrivial, and both complexes
of operators satisfy the empirically signiﬁcant constraint of locality despite the diﬀerence.
We may also introduce a 4-momentum transfer between components of Eq. (29) that can be
compared with the construction of Eq. (21). As a simplest example, using a free linear Wightman
ﬁeld ˆφf = af∗+ a†
f, [af, a†
g] = (f, g), we construct
ˆζζf =
Z
: ˆφf[u] ˆφf[−u] : ˜W(u) d4u

Z
: ˆφ(x1)ˆφ(x2):f(x1)f(x2)W(x1 −x2)d4x1d4x2,

where f[u](z) = f(z)eiu·z, f
f[u](k) = ˜f(k + u) [this notation can be used to make the notation (f, g)[u]
redundant, if desired, because (f, g)[u] = (f[u], g[u])].
We note ﬁrst that ˜W(u) should be Lorentz
invariant, but does not have to be positive semi-deﬁnite, so that we will call these objects weights
rather than propagators (although positive semi-deﬁniteness in wave-number space is not necessary
for classical propagators, positive semi-deﬁniteness is necessary where propagators are used to
construct a commutator between creation and annihilation operators), so that the behavior of W(x)
at small space-like or time-like separation is unconstrained, except that because of the symmetry
of Eq. (30), we can take ˜W(−u) = ˜W(u), W(−x) = W(x), and hence also that ˜W∗(u) = ˜W(u) and
W∗(x) = W(x). For the 2-measurement VEV ⟨0| ˆζζ

Such VEVs always result in expressions in which W(·) is dependent on separations between the
xi integration variables and the yi integration variables separately, associated with diﬀerent test
functions separately (because, in this example, the integration variable u1 is a parameter only of ˜f
and of ˜W, and similarly u2 is a parameter only of ˜g and of an independent instance of ˜W) instead
of being dependent on diﬀerences of separations associated with diﬀerent test functions, such as
the expression (x1 −x2) −(y1 −y2) that occurred in Eq. (23). This construction, however, is not
necessarily as trivial as the equivalent construction for the linear Wightman ﬁeld, where the result
is just a function of the Gaussian observable, insofar as we take the Hilbert space of the theory to
be generated by the operators ˆζζf, which in general is a subspace of the Hilbert space generated by
Gaussian operators ˆξξf.
One consequence of nonlinearity is that a Hilbert space that supports a representation of the
Poincar´e group may not be separable (that is, there may not be a countable basis), insofar as every

15
multiple and sum of test functions may construct an additional linearly independent operator. Al-
lowing non-separable Hilbert spaces is possible, and in time mathematical control of non-separable
Hilbert spaces may improve, but it would be preferable to introduce suﬃcient symmetries to restore
separability of the Hilbert space. It is also possible at the practical level to require only that the
construction of the Hilbert space of a quantum ﬁeld theory is manifestly Lorentz and translation
covariant, which is mathematically much weaker than requiring that the Hilbert space support a
representation of the Poincar´e group. Requiring only covariance is compatible with model-building
in physics, which does not require that every possible model that is related to a given model by
Lorentz transformations or by translations is encompassed by a single Hilbert space, only that a
new Hilbert space can be readily constructed for any given Lorentz transformation or translation.
Nonetheless, the introduction of symmetries that return us to the case of a separable Hilbert space
that supports a representation of the Poincar´e group is desirable, for the sake both of mathematics
and of engineering.

not contribute to the physical Hilbert space because they are in the kernel of all inner products

taken with the commutation relation [ˆξξf, ˆξξg] = ((f∗, g))−((g∗, f)), is enough to ﬁx the thermal state

which, following the example of the KMS-condition [3, §V.1], we may take to deﬁne the thermal

used formally to derive it. Finally, we note that we can construct similar states for any operator

sum P∞
n=1 ((f, Xn(g))) to converge, and ensures that ((fi, Xn(fj))) is a positive semi-deﬁnite matrix;
in general, this construction will result in non-equilibrium thermodynamic states. The amplitude
transformation X(f) = e−αf is perhaps worth noting as enhancing quantum ﬂuctuations associated
with linear terms in the commutator relative to the quantum ﬂuctuations associated with higher
degree nonlinear terms.
A nonlinear Wightman ﬁeld ˆζζw(x) = ˆζζwx does not in general satisfy an equation comparable

because ˆζζw(x) may be a functional of ˆξξT[w]x for translation invariant maps T : w 7→T[w], however
the explicit constructions given above for ˆζζf ﬁxes the VEVs of the ﬁeld as a function of x and as
functionals of w, so that the VEVs will satisfy equations of some kind. It presents a signiﬁcant
constraint on theories if we require the equations satisﬁed to be invariant for diﬀerent choices of the
test functions fi, or, less stringently, if we require the equations satisﬁed to be invariant for diﬀerent
choices of xi when the fi are chosen to be fi = wxi, for ﬁxed w; although such requirements might
be derived from experimental data, it is not necessary from the perspective of the mathematical
construction.
All the constructions in this section are by intention concrete, which is desirable to see the
range of possible phenomenology in moderate detail. Taking Lorentz invariance to be more-or-less
straightforwardly ensured by appropriate formalism and notation, the conditions that a construc-
tion of a nonlinear Wightman ﬁeld that uses creation and annihilation operators must satisfy may

DISCUSSION
The next steps for this approach are to characterize as precisely as possible how close nonlin-
ear Wightman ﬁelds —which clearly introduce signiﬁcantly more ﬂexibility than most axiomatic
approaches— can come to equalling the modeling eﬀectiveness of Lagrangian QFT and of statis-
tical physics; and to investigate what natural constraints may be provided by symmetry or other
empirically motivated considerations. It is to be hoped that the investigation will clarify our under-
standing of Lagrangian QFT even if we discover that nonlinear Wightman ﬁelds are not a useful
modeling tool for particle physics experiments.
It also appears that some concepts in statisti-
cal physics might be clariﬁed by comparison with the introduction of hidden propagators, which
introduce potentially complex stochastic synchronizations that do not modify measurement incom-
patibility at space-like separation but may modify observed correlations even at large space-like
separations when enough care is taken to construct resonances between preparation and measure-
ment apparatuses.
What equivalences there might be between models is complicated by the possibility of making
diﬀerent assignments of frequencies, widths, and other, more precise details when choosing what
test functions to use when constructing a model for a given experimental apparatus than we have
been accustomed to making when constructing models in interacting Lagrangian QFT. We not
only have to consider whether there is a model in which ˆζζf ≈ˆξf for any test function f and for
some empirically successful Lagrangian QFT operator ˆξf, where ≈denotes some kind of empirical
equivalence, we also have to consider whether there is a consistent choice of operators ˆAζζ and
ˆAξ for a given preparation apparatus or measurement apparatus, what we will call “engineering
rules” for the ∗-algebras generated by ˆζζf and by ˆξf, for which ˆAζζ ≈ˆAξ; an equivalence ˆζζf ≈ˆξf is
desirable but physically inessential, whereas for a theory to be useful there must be an empirical
correspondence ˆAζζ ≈ˆAξ for a substantial range of preparation and measurement apparatuses.
The primary connection with the past that is preserved here has been the Wightman axioms,
with the introduction of some form of nonlinearity suggested by a speciﬁc reading of the mathe-
matics of the renormalization of Lagrangian QFT. The secondary connection with the past that
is preserved here has been the structure of a creation and annihilation operator ∗-algebra, the
only known model of the Wightman axioms in Minkowski space, modiﬁed by the introduction of
a natural nonlinearity. The resulting mathematics is of some interest, however it is probably too
unconstrained, needing either a further or a diﬀerent connection with existing theory and with
experiment. As far as introducing diﬀerent choices is concerned, a reliance on creation and anni-
hilation operators as a starting point seems relatively unimaginative, given the variety of algebras
that is available in the mathematical literature, although they seem a good enough ﬁrst choice,
whereas gauge invariance is the obvious further choice (a ﬁrst essay at which may be found at the
end of Appendix A).
If we ﬁnd that nonlinear Wightman ﬁelds are useful, their considerable and perhaps excessive
ﬂexibility suggests that they may be an elaborate intermediate system of epicycles more than an
immediately explanatory theory; some form of higher level mathematics will likely have to be in-
troduced to provide an explanatory structure. Nonlinear Wightman ﬁeld models are apparently
adaptable to a wide range of phenomena, comparably to the adaptability of nonlinear diﬀerential

19
equations as deterministic models. The greater ﬂexibility as a starting point for models is a reason-
able reﬂection of the higher order of the mathematics of probabilities over the conﬁguration space
of a ﬁeld theory, and the non-classical description of the evolution of those probability densities
over time that is aﬀorded by quantum ﬁeld theory, compared to the lower order mathematics of
the classical dynamics of particles or of a ﬁeld conﬁguration and momentum.
I am grateful for comments from David Schneider on an earlier draft.
Appendix A: Non-scalar ﬁelds
The notation [af, a†
g] = (f, g) for the free ﬁeld case, and equally for the nonlinear analogues
in Section IV, applies straightforwardly to observable non-scalar ﬁelds by taking test functions
eﬀectively to be functions of their Lorentz or internal symmetries as well as of position, so that a
ﬁeld operator such as ˆφf or an annihilation operator such as af is a scalar object. The free scalar
ﬁeld of a given mass is associated with the scalar positive semi-deﬁnite inner product
[af, a†
g] = (f, g) =
Z
˜f∗(k)˜g(k)2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0) d4k
(2π)4 ;
(A1)
for the free electromagnetic or massive bivector ﬁeld, this is replaced by the scalar positive semi-
deﬁnite inner product
[af, a†
g] = (f, g) = −
Z
˜f∗
[αµ](k)kαgµνkβ˜g[βν](k)2πδ(k·k −m2)θ(k0) d4k
(2π)4 ,
(A2)
where the positive semi-deﬁniteness arises from ˜f∗
[αµ](k)kα and kβ˜g[βν](k) being space-like 4-vectors
that are both orthogonal to the null or time-like 4-vector k (note that the bivector test function
g[βν](·) must be distinguished from the constant Minkowski space metric gµν, with signature (+ −
−−), following the conventions in [7]). Hence, the notation [af, a†
g] = (f, g) is equally applicable
to the scalar, to the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and for any test function space for which we introduce
a positive semi-deﬁnite inner product. When hidden propagators H(u) and wave-number shifted
positive semi-deﬁnite inner products are introduced, a wave-number index u might be taken to
include Lorentz or internal indices, provided positive semi-deﬁniteness is maintained, however the
simplest construction introduces the wave-number shifted positive semi-deﬁnite inner product
(f, g)[u] = −

for the electromagnetic ﬁeld, indexed only by the wave-number u.
For charged ﬁelds, reproducing the conventional model in a more compact and more manageable
notation, we introduce a column vector f =

ˆφf = afc + a†
f = a1,f∗

[af, a†
g] = (f, g) =
Z
˜f†(k)i˜∆+(k)˜g(k) d4k

(A5)

so that [ˆφf, ˆφg] = (fc, g) −(gc, f) = (f∗
2 , g1) −(g∗
1, f2) + (f∗
1 , g2) −(g∗
2, f1), which is zero, satisfying
locality, when the supports of f and g are space-like separated. Additionally, note that ˆφf is an
observable, ˆφf = ˆφ†
f, when f = fc =

We can also construct free Fermionic Dirac ﬁelds in a similar smeared operator form. We take
ˆψU to be a complex linear functional of a spinor-valued test function U, ˆψUc = bUc + d†
U, where
the annihilation operators bU and dU follow the usual convention of being complex anti-linear in
U, so that we have to introduce charge conjugation to ensure that bUc is complex linear in U. For
these scalar smeared operators, we have the anti-commutation relations
{bU, b†
V } = {dU, d†
V } =

where {bUc, b†
V c} and {d†

negative frequency parts of the positive semi-deﬁnite anti-commutator { ˆψU, ˆψ†
V }, which is zero when
U and V have space-like separated supports. The arbitrary phase introduced by charge conjugation
cancels in these equations because of the identities AcγµBc = BγµA and Ac Bc = −B A. Explicitly,
for {bUc, b†
V c}, we have
{bUc, b†

and (V, U) = (V, U)++(V, U)−. It is essential for the construction of the Fermionic Fock space that
Eq. (A6) is positive semi-deﬁnite and that when U and V have space-like separated supports we
have the identity (V, U)+ = −(V, U)−. We can construct a generalization to nonlinear Wightman
ﬁelds similar to that of Section IV by taking, for example, {bU, b†
V } = {dU, d†
V } = [(U, V )+]3, so
that { ˆψU, ˆψ†
V } = [(V, U)+]3 + [(V, U)−]3, which is zero when U and V have space-like separated
supports; it is apparent that only odd powers of (U, V )+ may be introduced. For even powers
of (U, V )+, we may construct charged Bosonic ﬁelds, such as, for example, [bU, b†
V ] = [dU, d†
V ] =
[(U, V )+]2, ˆξξU = bUc +d†
U, for which [ˆξξU, ˆξξ
†
V ] = [(Uc, V c)+]2 −[(V, U)+]2 = [(V, U)−]2 −[(V, U)+]2,
which satisﬁes locality.
Eq. (A6) is not the most general positive semi-deﬁnite inner product on the Dirac spinor test
function space that satisﬁes locality; if we allow the use of γ5 = iγ0γ1γ2γ3, for which (γ5)2 = 1,
γ5 = −γ5, Acγµγ5Bc = Bγµγ5A, Acγ5Bc = −Bγ5A, and γ5γµ + γµγ5 = 0, then we can construct

The highly developed computational technology associated with Feynman diagrams does not
encourage the development of formalisms that use test functions. Test function or window function
thinking is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from quantum ﬁeld thinking, however, leading, for example, to a
construction for gauge invariant nonlinear Wightman ﬁelds in which we introduce a Dirac spinor
test function U(x), a scalar test function u(x), and a 4-vector test function uµ(x), with which we
locally construct a Dirac spinor test function [eiuU](x) = eiu(x)U(x) and a 4-vector test function

φ(x) ∈R,
(A14)
and similarly for (V, v, v). We have delayed describing uµ(x) and vν(x) until after this equation
because the mathematics makes it clear they are test connections, objects that do not exist in La-
grangian QFT, which, like a test function, can be succinctly said to be a description or coordinates
of what we are measuring instead of what the ﬁeld is. Measurement operators can be constructed
from these creation and annihilation operators,
ˆψ(U,u,u) = b(Uc

(U1,u) + d(Uc
2,−u∗) + b†
(U2,u),

22
ˆξξ(U,u,u) = a(−u∗,−u∗) + a†
(u,u),
(A15)
where we have introduced a vector of two Dirac spinor test functions U = (U1, U2), because the
Dirac wave function is charged, together with just one scalar and 4-vector test function pair.
Note that ˆψ(U,u,u) is an observable, ˆψ†
(U,u,u) = ˆψ(U,u,u), just if [eiu(x)U1(x)]c = eiu(x)U2(x), and
that with the addition of nonlinear interaction terms, ˆψ(U,u,u) and ˆξξ(U,u,u) may both depend on
all their parameters.
Note also that the signs introduced into the two conjugations (Uc, −u∗)
and (−u∗, −u∗) are required to ensure that both observables are local. It is sometimes claimed
that local gauge symmetry is the mathematical structure that underlies the empirical success of
Lagrangian QFT, which is taken here to be enough to motivate further investigation of this or
other locally gauge invariant constructions in a test function framework, although it is far from
clear how tractable or empirically successful the mathematics will be. Whether and how any of
this multiplicity of structure might be ﬁtted together to make contact with experiment and to give
a detailed alternative to quantum electrodynamics or to the standard model of particle physics is
of course not yet in reach.
