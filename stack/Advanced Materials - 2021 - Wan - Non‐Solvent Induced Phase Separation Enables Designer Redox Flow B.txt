devices, RFB electrolyte tanks are easily 
accessible, enabling electrolyte scale-up, 
maintenance, and potential exchange of 
new redox couples (Figure 1a). Despite 
their advantages, current iterations of 
RFBs are considered too costly for many 
emerging grid applications,[1,4,5] motivating 
research into improved electrolyte formu-
lations,[6,7]

technologies,[8–10] 
operational strategies,[11] and materials 
design.[12] In particular, increasing power 
density enables more compact and effi-
cient reactors that can meet operational 
demands, reducing electrochemical stack 
size and costs. Within the reactor, the 
porous carbonaceous electrode supports 
several important functions, including 
conducting 
electrons 
and 
heat, 
pro-
viding surface area for redox reactions to 
occur, distributing electrolyte through the 
reactor, and regulating the operational 
pressure drop.[13] Thus, the interfacial 
and microstructural properties influence 
electrochemical and fluid dynamic per-
formance, ultimately impacting system 
efficiency and cost.[14] Historically, con-
ventional RFB electrodes have been fibrous mats derived from 
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor and assembled into coherent 
structures including papers, cloths, or felts.[15] Such formats 
are functional for convection-driven electrochemical tech-
nologies owing to their permeability (k  ≈ 10−10 to 10−12 m2), 
(electro)chemical stability, and electronic conductivity. Each 
unique fiber arrangement results in constructs with idiosyncratic 
Porous carbonaceous electrodes are performance-defining components in 
redox flow batteries (RFBs), where their properties impact the efficiency, cost, 
and durability of the system. The overarching challenge is to simultaneously 
fulfill multiple seemingly contradictory requirements—i.e., high surface area, 
low pressure drop, and facile mass transport—without sacrificing scalability 
or manufacturability. Here, non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) 
is proposed as a versatile method to synthesize tunable porous structures 
suitable for use as RFB electrodes. The variation of the relative concentration 
of scaffold-forming polyacrylonitrile to pore-forming poly(vinylpyrrolidone) 
is demonstrated to result in electrodes with distinct microstructure and 
porosity. Tomographic microscopy, porosimetry, and spectroscopy are used 
to characterize the 3D structure and surface chemistry. Flow cell studies 
with two common redox species (i.e., all-vanadium and Fe2+/3+) reveal that 
the novel electrodes can outperform traditional carbon fiber electrodes. 
It is posited that the bimodal porous structure, with interconnected large 
(>50 µm) macrovoids in the through-plane direction and smaller (<5 µm) 
pores throughout, provides a favorable balance between offsetting traits. 
Although nascent, the NIPS synthesis approach has the potential to serve as 
a technology platform for the development of porous electrodes specifically 
designed to enable electrochemical flow technologies.

Stationary energy storage is poised to play a pivotal role in the 
efficient delivery of electricity, particularly for the integration 
of low-cost, variable, and sustainable energy sources into the 
electricity grid.[1,2] Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are a promising 
technological option for multihour energy storage owing to their 
decoupling of energy and power rating, scalability, and longer 
operational lifetimes.[3] Compared to sealed electrochemical

microstructural features, translating to disparities in available 
surface area, pore size distribution, fluid dynamics, and conse-
quently, electrochemical performance.[16] The most commonly 
used materials are repurposed from fuel cell gas diffusion elec-
trodes (GDEs) and are not designed to support the liquid-phase 
electrochemistry of contemporary RFBs. Advances in zero-gap 
reactor architecture and thinner electrodes to ameliorate ohmic 
losses have led to significant performance enhancement at the 
lab scale;[14,17] furthermore, reactor design and stack topology 
are continually progressing to satisfy larger-scale energy 
demands.[18–22] However, the fundamental challenge remains to 
simultaneously enable ample surface area for redox reactions, 
high permeability to reduce the pressure loss, and augmented 
mass transfer to minimize concentration overpotentials—all 
while using materials that are fabricated using continuous, 
low-cost, and sustainable manufacturing techniques.
Accordingly, research efforts have focused on tailoring RFB 
electrodes, both in terms of surface functional groups and 
microstructural arrangements. Interfacial engineering efforts 
have predominantly comprised introducing elementally diverse 
functional groups for enhanced wettability and electrochemical 
activity through thermal, chemical, or other modes of oxida-
tion.[13,23–27] In regard to microstructure, a growing body of work 
focuses on developing interconnected pores across multiple 
length scales to balance kinetics and mass transport,[28] either 
by fabricating thinner electrospun fiber scaffolds[29] with direc-
tional fiber alignment[30,31] or generating architectures with mul-
titudes of pore sizes.[32–35] Advanced numerical simulations on 
porous media have demonstrated that streamwise-oriented fibers 
and pores can lead to increased permeabilities and improved 
dispersion efficiency;[36] furthermore, material sets possessing 
wide variability in pore sizes with high specific surface area 
induce higher dispersion and reaction rates, improving overall 
performance.[37–41] Collectively, these prior works constitute 
important advances in the electrochemical science and engi-
neering of porous electrodes. However, translation beyond the

lab-scale remains a concern, as constraints inherent to existent 
large-scale carbon fiber manufacturing processes necessitate the 
introduction of additional and often complex post-treatments to 
produce electrodes with suitable performance characteristics, 
which results in increased production costs. Roll-to-roll carbon 
fiber based electrode manufacturing includes a combination of  
consecutive steps including fiber spinning, sizing, chopping, 
papermaking/weaving, impregnation, and curing, among 
others.[42] From a manufacturing perspective, the ability to gen-
erate diverse 3D porous architectures without using complex 
fabrication steps is appealing for improved cost efficiency and 
performance.
Here, we introduce non-solvent induced phase separation 
(NIPS) as a novel approach to fabricating RFB electrodes. NIPS 
enables the generation of nonfibrous porous materials with 
long-range interconnected microstructures and unique prop-
erty profiles—achievable through systematic variation of easily 
adjustable design parameters (Figure 1b,d)—which are unattain-
able in current fibrous materials. Such synthetic control opens 
possibilities toward designing complex interconnected porous 
networks including spatial porosity gradients or multimodal 
pore size distributions. Accordingly, electrodes with complex 
pore profiles may be achieved in a single manufacturing NIPS 
process instead of several distinct fiber production processes. 
Furthermore, the NIPS synthesis process is scalable, as demon-
strated by existing membrane production facilities with similar 
process steps.[43] In addition to membrane separations,[44] NIPS 
has been demonstrated for preparing electrodes in supercapaci-
tors[45,46] and in Li-ion batteries[47] or for electrosensing applica-
tions.[48] However, to the best of our knowledge, prior efforts 
have not focused on using NIPS to synthesize porous electrodes 
suitable for electrochemical systems with forced convection. We 
hypothesize that the hierarchical combination of highly acces-
sible pores along with areas of finer porosity enables low pres-
sure drop through-plane highways to distribute liquid electrolyte, 
leading into higher surface area microvoids, beneficial for RFBs, 
as previously demonstrated.[16,28,49,50] In this interconnected 
porous network, the pores exhibiting the largest features miti-
gate convective mass transport losses by replenishing the elec-
trolyte to the high-surface-area region, corresponding to zones of 
finer porosity, reducing the diffusion length, and in turn allevi-
ating activation and mass transport overpotential losses.
Here, we show that by varying the ratio of scaffold forming 
polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to pore-forming poly(vinylpyrrolidone) 
(PVP) in the NIPS casting solution, we create a class of mate-
rials with related but differing property sets and, consequently, 
electrochemical performance. A suite of spectroscopic, micro-
scopic, and electroanalytical methods were used to system-
atically characterize the properties of the newly synthesized 
materials, and these results were compared to a commercial 
standard (SGL 29AA, 186 ± 4 µm). Subsequently, the electro-
chemical and fluid dynamic performance of all the electrodes 
were evaluated in diagnostic flow cells with well-understood 
and commercially relevant redox electrolytes. Our results show 
that the unoptimized NIPS electrodes outperform the SGL 
29AA electrode owing to reduced kinetic and mass transport 
overpotentials. Even in their preliminary embodiment, these 
materials show considerable promise for high power operation. 
We envision that the NIPS approach has the potential to serve 
as a scalable synthetic platform that enables the generation of 
diverse structures for deepening understanding of microstruc-
ture–function–performance relations and for progressing per-
formance of emergent electrochemical technologies.
The phase separation process (PSP) yields uniform elec-
trodes, which are illustrated in Figure 1c. Full synthesis details 
and images are provided in Section S2 and Figure S1 in the 
Supporting Information. Briefly, a viscous mixture of PAN and 
PVP dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent was 
first cast in a glass mold. The cast mixture was then immersed 
in a water bath to initiate phase separation into a polymer-rich 
and polymer-lean phase, whereby the water-soluble PVP leached 
into the non-solvent, leaving behind a porous PAN scaffold. 
Subsequently, the scaffold was thermally stabilized in air for 1 h 
at 270 °C at a ramp rate of 2 °C min–1, and carbonized under 
flowing nitrogen for 40 min at 850 °C and 40 min at 1050 °C, 
with a 5  °C  min–1 ramp rate in between. The selected condi-
tions were based on well-documented protocols to improve 
the mechanical and electrical properties of the resulting elec-
trode.[29,51–53] The yield after carbonization was ≈57 ± 5% 
(Figure S2, Supporting Information), in accordance with previ-
ously reported values.[54,55] The process versatility is captured 
in Figure  1d; we envision that polyporous, isoporous, and/or 
porosity gradient electrodes can be fabricated through variation 
of a range of easily accessible parameters including polymer 
concentration, bath temperature, and solution viscosity.[44,46,56–58] 
Such parameters influence the thermodynamics and kinetics 
of the phase separation process which ultimately governs the 
final electrode microstructure. In this proof-of-concept study, 
we elected to focus on the effect of relative amounts of PAN to 
PVP dissolved in a fixed volume of DMF, investigating three dif-
ferent mixture ratios. For brevity, the electrodes derived from 
these samples are referred to as PSP-1:1, PSP-3:4, and PSP-2:3, 
where PSP indicates phase-separated materials, and the ratio is 
the relative PAN:PVP amount by mass.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to visu-
alize the synthesized microstructures (Figure 2a). The images 
reveal highly porous structures, containing regions of large, 
finger-like (>100 µm) voids (hereon referred to as macrovoids) 
interconnected to and outlined from porous networks con-
sisting of smaller cavities (hereon referred to as microvoids). 
The hierarchical structure is a direct consequence of deliber-
ately choosing polymer concentration ranges that form macro-
void regions during phase separation, which we hypothesized 
would act as channels to distribute electrolyte and mitigate 
transport losses.[16,59] X-ray tomography (XTM) was performed 
to assess the 3D structure of the porous material. An example 
3D reconstruction for the PSP-2:3 is illustrated in Figure  2b; 
reconstructions of all the samples are shown in Figure S5 (Sup-
porting Information). Although the representative cross sec-
tion in the XY-plane (Figure 2b) shows the same through-plane 
view as the SEM in Figure  1a, the XZ-plane reveals the pres-
ence of an internal honeycomb-like distribution of macrovoids 
throughout the porous structure, observable in all the PSP 
materials (Figure S5, Supporting Information).
Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) was used as a semi-
quantitative technique to extract the pore size distributions 
(PSDs) and porosities (Figure 2c) of each sample in the micropo-
rous region. Owing to intrinsic limitations in the observable

pore sizes from MIP, macrovoids were not detectable.[60] The 
MIP determined porosities (εMIP) of the PSP materials increased 
as the relative PVP content increased, whereby PSP-1:1 had the 
lowest porosity (εMIP ≈ 0.66), followed by the PSP-3:4 (εMIP ≈ 0.70), 
and the PSP-2:3 (εMIP ≈ 0.75), approaching that of the represent-
ative fibrous material SGL 29AA (εMIP ≈ 0.77). The microvoids of 
the PSP electrodes ranged from 1 to 60 µm (Table S1, Supporting 
Information). In all PSP materials, the pore diameters were 
significantly smaller than that of the SGL 29AA electrode. As 
expected, PSP-1:1 with the highest PAN content resulted in nar-
rower PSD (≈1–8 µm) compared to PSP-2:3 (≈2–50 µm). The 
PSP-1:1 and PSP-2:3 samples exhibited bimodal porous struc-
tures; interestingly, the PSP-3:4 had a predominantly unimodal 
PSD with a shoulder, resembling the larger pore diameter peak in

the PSP-2:3 sample, but without the additional, distinct smaller 
pore diameter peak. The unimodal PSD observed from MIP for 
the PSP-3:4 was reproducible for multiple samples (Figure S6,  
Supporting Information). To validate the MIP results, PSDs 
were also extracted from the SEM images using ImageJ soft-
ware (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The full extraction 
procedure is described in Section S2 (Supporting Information). 
PSDs obtained from SEM images were in good agreement with 
MIP, although we were unable to resolve the bimodal nature of 
the microvoids, presumably due to loss of information during 
the extraction procedure.[61] Some samples showed variations in 
pore size across the electrode thickness (Figure S4, Supporting 
Information), with smaller pores (corresponding to higher 
surface area) closer to the membrane, which could be beneficial 
for balancing transport phenomena with higher electrochemical 
activity near the membrane.
Raman spectroscopy (Figure  2d) and X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Figure  2e) were performed to 
assess the surface chemistry of the synthesized materials. 
Raman spectra of SGL 29AA and PSP electrodes exhibited typ-
ical fingerprints of carbonaceous materials.[62–64] The first-order 
region spreads from 1100 to 1800 cm–1 and the second-order 
region from 2200 to 3400 cm–1.[62] All-four samples displayed 
D and G bands around 1380 and 1600 cm–1 in the first-order 
region and broad bands in the second-order region attributed to 
S1 and S2.[62,63] The ID/IG ratio was calculated from the Raman 
spectra, and the values are indicated in Table S2 (Supporting 
Information). No significant differences were observed which 
might underline similar “defect” loading in each sample. The 
presence of binder material in the commercial SGL 29AA might 
also alter the defect loading, thus stymying a strict comparison 
of the ID/IG ratios owing to different synthetic conditions. 
The carbonization conditions along with heteroatoms doping 
greatly influence the ID/IG ratio; therefore, a deconvolution of 
the defects generated by the presence of different carbon allo-
tropes or owing to heteroatoms doping remains challenging. 
When looking at the second-order region, the PSP electrodes 
exhibited a broad merged S1/S2 band, whereas SGL 29AA had 
two distinguishable bands. Previous work suggests that carbon 
materials exhibiting sharp S1/S2 bands reflect a higher tridi-
mensional order of the graphitic structure which is correlated 
with high carbonization temperatures, typically close to or 
higher than 1500 °C.[62,63] The SGL 29AA carbon paper shows 
a low heteroatom content and highly graphitic carbon signature 
suggesting that high carbonization temperatures (>2000 °C) are 
used during the carbon fiber manufacturing process, resulting 
in conductive graphitized materials.[55] In comparison, the PSP 
electrodes exhibit higher heteroatoms content (N at% from 
7.8  ± 1.0 to 11.9 ± 2.8 and O at% from 2.9  ±  1.0  to 3.1 ± 1.1)  
(Table S2, Supporting Information) owing, at least in part, to 
the lower carbonization temperature (1050 °C) and in accord-
ance with prior reports.[52,65,66] Detailed XPS fitting of C1s, N1s, 
and O1s indicates the PSP electrodes exhibited several nitrogen 
and oxygen types (Figure S7, Supporting Information). The 
main nitrogen type groups are ascribed to pyrrolic and pyridinic 
nitrogen, whereas oxygens are attributed to carbonyl and ether/
epoxy/alcohol groups. The presence of quaternary, pyrrolic, 
and pyridinic nitrogen types is corroborated with the cycliza-
tion of PAN. We emphasize that using a lower carbonization 
temperature leads to a greater density of desirable electrocata-
lytic heteroatoms, comparable effective conductivity, and poten-
tially reduced production costs by eliminating the need to use 
expensive high temperature ovens.[54]
To demonstrate the performance of the synthesized mate-
rials under conditions closer to practical embodiments, we 
first use a single-electrolyte flow cell configuration (Figure 3a) 
to assess cell polarization and to quantify resistive losses using 
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at steady-
state conditions and 50% state-of-charge (SoC).[14,16,67] The 
single-electrolyte setup is advantageous because it enables 
the identification of ohmic, kinetic, and mass transport resist-
ances within the cell, without introducing uncontrolled system 
level variables.[68] In this setup, the electrolyte is first oxidized 
at the positive electrode and then circulated into the negative 
electrode, where it is reduced, and then is recirculated into the 
reservoir. An equivalent Randles-like circuit with a Warburg 
element for convective diffusion (Wδ) can be used to analyze 
the Nyquist plots obtained using EIS at open-circuit poten-
tial to deconvolute ohmic, kinetic, and mass transport losses 
(inset of Figure  3c).[16,67,68] In this circuit, RΩ corresponds to 
ohmic resistance, RCT to charge-transfer resistance, and RMT 
extracted from Wδ relates to mass-transfer resistance. Using 
this framework, the product iRΩ can be used to approximate 
ohmic contributions, which can be removed from polarization 
curve analysis to focus on kinetic and mass transport resist-
ances (Figure  3b). We note that the resistances determined 
from the equivalent circuit model should be treated at most 
semiquantitatively, as the relatively simple model does not cap-
ture physical representations of the electrodes. We also used 
the single-electrolyte setup under flow in supporting electro-
lyte (2 m HCl) to measure electrochemically accessible surface 
area (ECSA) representing the amount of available surface for 
double-layer ion adsorption.
Figure 3b shows the current density output at a given applied 
iRΩ-corrected overpotential for the three different phase-
separated electrode samples (PSP-1:1, PSP-3:4, and PSP-2:3) 
compared to a commercial SGL 29AA pristine electrode at an 
estimated linear velocity of 5 cm s–1. The average thicknesses 
of the synthesized electrodes were 670 ± 56 µm, whereas the 
average thickness of SGL 29AA was 186 ± 4 µm (Table S3, Sup-
porting Information); a single electrode on each side was used 
for the single-electrolyte iron chloride analysis. To account for 
differences and variability in electrode thicknesses, experi-
ments were performed at equivalent superficial linear velocities,

the compressed electrode thickness (m), and we is the electrode 
width. In this study, we eschewed thermal pretreatments of the 
materials owing to their nuanced effects on the relevant elec-
trode properties as the efficacy of such treatment is dependent 
on manufacturing routes and carbonization conditions idiosyn-
cratic to each electrode.[24,69,70] Thus, we decided to compare 
pristine SGL 29AA to pristine PSP electrodes, sacrificing power 
performance for clearer comparative analysis. Future work will 
explore the effect of well-known electrode pretreatment strate-
gies on PSP electrode performance. Regardless of the PAN:PVP 
ratio, all PSP electrodes exhibited lower polarization losses as 
compared to the SGL 29AA electrode in both single-electrolyte

trolyte (Figure 4a) in this particular study. The performance of 
the PSP materials is consistent and reproducible for samples 
across different batches (Figure S8, Supporting Information). 
Furthermore, the volumetric ECSA measured in 2 m HCl sup-
porting electrolyte for the PSP material sets exceeds that of the 
single SGL 29AA (1.12 × 105 m–1); a representative capacitance 
measurement comparing the electrode set at 20 mV s–1 is shown 
in Figure 3e, whereas the full set of capacitance measurements 
can be found in Figure S11 (Supporting Information). For ref-
erence, the estimated values are of the same order of magni-

Specifically, for a material with porosity (ε) of 0.75 and fiber 
diameter (df) of 8 µm, a volumetric surface area of 1.25 × 105 m–1  
would be attained.[29,71–73] The PSP-1:1 showed the largest volu-
metric ECSA of all the electrodes (6.54 × 105 m–1), followed by 
the PSP-2:3 (3.66 × 105 m–1) and the PSP-3:4 (2.71 × 105 m–1). 
The PSP materials all demonstrated higher ECSA than the SGL 
29AA. The larger ECSA for the PSP-1:1 is expected, as lower total 
porosity correlates with increased specific area assuming similar 
surface morphology. Interestingly, single-electrolyte polarization 
and impedance demonstrated improved performance in lower 
surface area PSP-3:4 and PSP-2:3 compared to the higher sur-
face area PSP-1:1. As shown in Figure 2c, the PSP-1:1 microstruc-
ture is sharply bimodal, divided into a predominantly macrovoid 
region and a region that is composed of smaller microvoids. We

hypothesize that compared to the PSP-2:3 and PSP-3:4, the par-
tition of macro- to microvoids leads to a less favorable micro-
structure for mass transport. Thus, we rationalize there is a 
discrepancy between the capacitance-measured surface area and 
the utilizable surface area for electrochemical reactions. Nyquist 
plots shown in Figure 3c corroborate that larger mass transport 
resistance hinders PSP-1:1 as compared to PSP-3:4 and PSP-2:3.
To further investigate the effect of mass transport in the 
PSP electrodes, the electrolyte linear velocity was varied 
(Figure  3d). A breakdown of the relative contributions from 
ohmic, kinetic, and mass transport resistances is shown in 
the bar charts of Figure  3d. For the PSP-2:3, at a low flow 
rate (0.5  cm  s–1), mass transport overpotential is the most 
dominant source of loss, followed by ohmics and kinetics. 
As the flow rate increases, ohmics become increasingly more 
important, eventually comprising 80% of the overpotential 
by 5 cm s–1, and 86% by 10 cm s–1. Analogous Nyquist plots 
obtained using EIS as a function of flow rate for representa-
tive PSP-3:4, PSP-1:1, and SGL 29AA samples are shown in 
Figure S9 (Supporting Information), and a full summary of the 
resistances is provided in Table S5 (Supporting Information). 
In this equivalent circuit analysis, kinetic resistance remained  
a minor contributor until the highest velocity of 10 cm s–1, 
when convective flux enhances mass transport to the point 
where it is of similar magnitude to the kinetic rates. The mass 
transfer resistances also rapidly decrease and plateau with 
increasing linear velocity for all materials, although the mass 
transfer resistance for the PSP materials at 10 cm s–1 or greater 
linear velocities plateau at lower values than the SGL  29AA 
(Figure S10, Supporting Information). We note that the ohmic 
resistance of the PSP materials measured from the x-intercept 
of the Nyquist plots ranged on average from 0.207 to 0.311 Ω, 
similar in magnitude to the average ohmic resistance of the 
pristine commercial material, 0.246 Ω (Table S4, Supporting 
Information). The results suggest that the lower carbonization 
temperatures used for our process did not hinder the effective 
conductivity of the electrodes. Using lower carbonization tem-
peratures may eliminate the need for the higher graphitiza-
tion temperature step, thus reducing manufacturing costs and 
improving economic viability for PSP electrodes.[54] Finally, the 
pressure drop was determined as a function of linear velocity 
using both flow-through flow fields (FTFF) and interdigitated 
flow fields (IDFF) to assess pumping losses, using water as the 
fluid (Figure 3f,g). In FTFF, SGL 29AA had the highest perme-
ability (4.8  ×  10–11  m2), followed by PSP-2:3 (2.0  ×  10–11 m2), 
PSP-3:4 (1.1  ×  10–11  m2), and PSP-1:1 (7.6  ×  10–12 m2). For 
IDFF, the same trend held, with SGL29AA (3.2 × 10–10 m2), 
PSP-2:3 (7.5 × 10–11 m2), PSP-3:4 (3.3 × 10–11 m2), and PSP-1:1 
(2.2  ×  10–11  m2). The permeabilities measured for the PSP 
materials are comparable to other commercial carbon-
fiber-based electrodes, which are generally in the range of 
≈2.0–7.2 × 10–11 m2.[16]
Although the single-electrolyte experiments encourage the 
use of PSP materials for convection-driven applications, the 
PSP-2:3 material appears the most promising of the set, as 
the higher porosity and thus, permeability, reduces pressure  
losses during operation (see pressure drop measurements 
in Figure 3f,g). We next investigated the performance of PSP 
electrodes in a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), which 
represents the current state-of-the-art from lab to pilot scale 
and which is the most widely commercialized RFB tech-
nology.[21,74–78] For the same reasons previously discussed, SGL 
29AA has been chosen as a commonly used fibrous material 
toward advanced reactor architectures with thinner electrode 
designs.[17,24,33,79] Discharge polarization and power density 
curves along with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy 
of vanadium redox flow cells at 50% SoC for the PSP-2:3 and 
pristine SGL 29 AA carbon electrodes are shown in Figure 4a. 
Galvanostatic cycling of the PSP-2:3 electrode is provided in 
the Supporting Information (Figure S12, Supporting Informa-
tion). Encouragingly, the results demonstrate that PSP-2:3 has 
significantly enhanced power density compared to the com-
mercial pristine. Inspection of the Nyquist plots (Figure  4b) 
suggests that reduced kinetics and total resistance resulted in 
the enhanced power output, as the higher frequency semicircle 
which typically represents charge transfer kinetics was signifi-
cantly reduced in magnitude for the PSP material. Additionally, 
the ohmic resistance of the PSP-2:3 (0.235 Ω) was slightly lower 
compared to SGL 29AA (0.280 Ω) in the vanadium electrolyte. 
We attribute the bimodal pore size distribution of the PSP mate-
rial to benefit full cell polarization, where microvoids provide 
high surface area thereby reducing kinetic resistance, and the 
presence of macrovoids provides channels that reduce convec-
tive resistance, allowing for more complete electrode utilization.
In summary, we show that NIPS-derived electrodes consisting 
of interconnected, continuous porous networks hold promise

for RFBs and offer a credible platform for materials innovation, 
posing compelling alternatives to current fiber-based electrodes. 
The utilization of the NIPS technique as applied herein ena-
bles production of an unprecedented yet beneficial set of high 
porosity and multimodal materials. In addition to developing a 
versatile and potentially scalable method for fabricating designer 
RFB electrodes, we have systematically characterized the mate-
rials using spectroscopic techniques and evaluated their perfor-
mance in a single-electrolyte cell configuration, culminating in 
a full cell demonstration. Encouraging enhancement in power 
capabilities in both the iron chloride single electrolyte cell and 
the vanadium full cell motivates further exploration into the 
extensive NIPS parameter space. We posit that the combination 
of large macrovoid structures in tandem with high surface area 
microvoids mitigates convective transport and kinetic losses, 
respectively. We anticipate that optimization of the microstruc-
tural features beyond the examples chosen in this study can 
further enhance RFB performance. Furthermore, the intercon-
nected porous networks produced from NIPS are inherently 
well-suited for the design of electrodes with porosity gradients. 
Beyond RFB electrodes, the presented material concept may also 
be tailorable for a wide range of convection-driven electrochem-
ical technologies (e.g., fuel cells, electrolyzers) where local varia-
tions of pore size and porosity are necessary to optimize complex 
multiphase transport.
Experimental Section
Electrode Scaffold Formation: In this embodiment, the PVP and DMF 
dissolved into the coagulation bath upon submersion, leaving behind 
a porous PAN framework.[57,80,81] Subsequent thermal stabilization and 
carbonization of the polymer scaffold led to the desired electrically 
conductive electrode. Samples were made by mixing the following 
amounts of PAN and PVP in 10 mL of DMF: 1 g of PAN to 1 g PVP (1:1 
PAN:PVP by mass), 0.857 g of PAN to 1.143 g PVP (3:4 PAN:PVP by mass), 
or 0.8 g of PAN to 1.2 g PVP (3:4 PAN:PVP by mass). The powder and 
solvent were subsequently thoroughly mixed after heating in a 70 °C oil 
bath. An in-house glass mold for casting the mixed polymer solution was 
constructed on an 18 × 18 cm2 glass plate using 5 × 7 cm2 notches having 
a depth of 1.1 mm (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Once cooled to 
room temperature, the polymer solution was poured in the notches, and 
the edge of a doctor blade was used to evenly cast the solution into the 
glass notches. After 10 min at room temperature, the casted solution was 
carefully immersed into a water bath (water level 6 cm above the casted 
solutions). Polymeric scaffolds were left to phase-separate overnight at 
room temperature, after which they were transferred into a deionized 
(DI) water (Milli-Q Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm) bath and left overnight at 
70 °C to remove the remaining PVP still present in the porous structure. 
Afterward, the polymeric scaffolds were dried between two paper sheets 
and placed between poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE, Teflon) plates in an 
oven at 80 °C for >4 h for drying. Each polymeric scaffold was compressed 
with 0.399 cm thick, 5.1 × 10.8 cm2 alumina ceramic blocks (McMaster-
Carr) weighing 100 g on top of the Teflon plates.
Thermal Stabilization and Carbonization: Thermal stabilization of 
the PAN membranes was conducted to crosslink the polymer network 
and improve the final mechanical properties of the electrodes.[52,53] 
Membranes were sandwiched between two sheets of alumina paper 
(Profiltra B.V.) and two ceramic plates. Each membrane was compressed 
with 100 g on top of the ceramic plates during thermal stabilization. 
Membranes were thermally stabilized in air at 270  °C for 1 h at a 
ramp rate of 2  °C min–1. Directly following the thermal stabilization, 
membranes were sandwiched by the ceramic plates and placed in 
a tubular oven under a nitrogen flow of 2 L min–1. The carbonization 
sequence was: room temperature to 850 °C (ramp rate of 5 °C min–1), 
hold for 40 min, 850 to 1050  °C (ramp rate of 5  °C min–1), hold for  
40 min, cool down to room temperature.[29]
Ex Situ Characterization: A detailed description of the physicochemical 
characterization is provided in Section S3 (Supporting Information). The 
ex situ characterization techniques are briefly described in the information 
which follows.
SEM: The microstructure and morphology of the prepared electrodes 
were analyzed by a JEOL JSM-IT100 SEM at 10 kV acceleration voltage. 
Cross-section sample preparation was performed by dipping the 
electrodes in a mixture of 50:50 (v/v) H2O/isopropyl alcohol prior to 
cryofracturing in liquid nitrogen. Noncarbonized samples were coated 
with gold in a JEOL JFC-2300HR at 90 mA for 60 s for imaging.
XTM: 3D scans of the NIPS-prepared electrode materials were 
collected using a Zeiss Xradia 620 Versa. The PSP-2:3 sample was 
imaged with a 20× objective at a voltage of 50 kV, power of 4.5 W, 3.5 s 
exposure time, and 0.39 µm pixel size.
MIP: Analysis of pore size distributions was performed using an 
AutoPore IV 9500 using ≈100 mg electrode samples and a 5 cm3 
volume penetrometer. Pore diameters were calculated assuming a 
cylindrical shape and mercury–carbon contact angles of 130° (advancing 
and receding). The porosity of the bulk electrodes was estimated by 
registering the mass of the material before and after full imbibition with 
mercury, assuming a complete pore filling.
Raman Spectroscopy: The molecular structural signature of the bulk 
carbonaceous materials was studied with a 300R confocal Raman 
microscope. The laser used for Raman was an UHTS300S_Green_NIR 
working at a wavelength of λ  = 532.306 nm. The grating (G2) had 
a groove density of 600 gr mm−1 and a blaze wavelength (BLZ) of  
500 nm. The spectral center was set at 2400 cm−1, and the integration 
time was set at 5 s. Every sample was analyzed using the laser power set 
at 4.822 mW and a total of 50 accumulations.
XPS: Surface chemical functionalities were analyzed with a Thermo 
Scientific K-Alpha equipped with a monochromatic small-spot X-ray source 
and a 180° double focusing hemispherical analyzer with a 128-channel 
detector. Spectra were recorded with an aluminum anode (Al Kα = 1486.6 eV)  
operating at 72 W with a spot size of 400 µm in diameter. Survey scans 
were measured at a constant pass energy of 200 eV and region scans at  
50 eV. The background pressure was 2 × 10–9 mbar, and the pressure used 
during measurements was 3 × 10–7 mbar (argon) because of the charge 
compensation dual beam source.

Testing: 
For 
the 
single-electrolyte 
experiments, iron(II) chloride tetrahydrate (FeCl2·4H2O, 98%, Sigma 
Aldrich), iron(III) chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O, 97%, Sigma 
Aldrich), and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 37%, Sigma Aldrich) were dissolved 
in DI water. The total concentration of active species was 0.5  m at 
50% state-of-charge, with 2 m HCl supporting electrolyte. Daramic  
175 (175 µm thick, Daramic) microporous separator was used. FTFF 
was used for single-electrolyte polarization, impedance, and capacitance 
measurements. Volumetric flow rates were adjusted based on electrode 
thickness (Table S3, Supporting Information) to match a range of 
linear velocities (0.5, 1.5, 5, and 10 cm s–1). A compression of ≈20% 
was used for all samples. The porous electrode capacitance was used 
to determine the volumetric ECSA of the electrodes. Specifically, cyclic 
voltammetry was performed in the single-electrolyte configuration in  
2 m HCl supporting electrolyte across the range of −0.2 to 0.2 V to avoid 
Faradaic reactions, at an electrolyte velocity of 5 cm s–1 at scan rates of 
20, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mV s–1. The capacitance was determined from

0  V (A), C represents the capacitance (F), and dV/dt is the scan rate 
(V s–1). The specific capacitance of glassy carbon (23 µF cm–2) was used 
as a reference to estimate the porous electrode ECSA.[24,82] To account 
for differences in electrode thicknesses, the ECSA was normalized by the 
volume occupied by the compressed electrode, leading to a volumetric 
ECSA. Pressure drop measurements were conducted using water as the 
working fluid, taking the difference of the inlet and outlet measurements 
averaged over 20 s at multiple flow rates.

For discharge polarization and impedance measurements in the full-
cell configuration VRFB, starting electrolytes were composed of 1.5 m  
VOSO4 in 2.6 m H2SO4. 50% SoC electrolyte was prepared via 
electrolysis as described in detail in a previous report.[27] A Nafion 
212 membrane (50.8 µm nominal thickness, Fuel Cell Store) was 
presoaked >24 h in 2.6 m H2SO4 at ambient temperature prior to use 
as a separator. FTFF was used in combination with the electrode at a 
linear velocity of 10 cm s–1 for discharge polarization and impedance 
measurements. All iron chloride single-electrolyte experiments were 
carried out with single electrodes. Full vanadium cells were performed 
with a stack of 3× SGL 29AA electrodes to match the PSP electrodes 
thickness. More in-depth details are provided in Section S4 (Supporting
