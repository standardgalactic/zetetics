This book is dedicated to the memory of our friend 
and colleague, Steve Kuffler.
In a career that spanned 40 years, Stephen Kuffler made experiments on funda-
mental problems and laid paths for future research to follow. A feature of his work 
is the way in which the right problem was tackled using the right preparation. 
Examples are his studies on denervation, stretch receptors, efferent control, in-
hibition, GABA and peptides as transmitters, integration in the retina, glial cells, 
and the analysis of synaptic transmission. What gave papers by Stephen Kuffler a 
special quality were the clarity, the beautiful figures, and the underlying excitement. 
Moreover, he himself had done every experiment he described. Stephen Kuffler’s 
work exemplified and introduced a multidisciplinary approach to the study of 
the nervous system. At Harvard he created the first department of neurobiology, 
in which he brought together people from different disciplines who developed 
new ways of thinking. Those who knew him remember a unique combination of 
tolerance, firmness, kindness, and good sense with enduring humor. He was the 
J. F. Enders University Professor at Harvard, and was associated with the Marine 
Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole. Among his many honors was his election 
as a foreign member of the Royal Society.

When the First Edition of our book appeared in 1976, its pref-
ace stated that our aim was “…to describe how nerve cells go 
about their business of transmitting signals, how the signals are 
put together, and how out of this integration higher functions 
emerge. This book is directed to the reader who is curious about 
the workings of the nervous system but does not necessarily have 
a specialized background in biological sciences. We illustrate the 
main points by selected examples…”. 
This new, Fifth Edition has been written with the same aim in 
mind but in a very different context. When the First Edition appeared 
there were hardly any books, and only a few journals devoted to the 
nervous system. The extraordinary advances in molecular biology, 
genetics, and immunology had not yet been applied to the study of 
nerve cells or the brain, and the internet was not available for searching 
the literature. The explosion in knowledge since 1976 means that 
even though we still want to produce a readable narrative, the topics 
that have to be addressed and the number of pages have increased. 
Inevitably, descriptions of certain older experiments have had to be 
jettisoned, even though they still seem beautiful. Nevertheless, our 
approach continues to be to follow ideas from their conception to 
the latest developments. To this end, in this edition we have retained 
descriptions of classical experiments as well as the newest findings. 
In this way we hope to present key lines of research of interest for 
practicing research workers and teachers of neurobiology, as well 
as for readers who are not familiar with the field. 
For the Fifth Edition, new chapters have been added, others 
have been completely rewritten and all have been brought up to 
date. In addition there are two obvious, major changes from the 
last edition. First, as in the original text by Kuffler and Nicholls, 
a discussion of the visual system now comes in the first part of 
the book, with the same intent. Placing this information at the 
beginning of the book highlights its importance and immediately 
gives the reader a glimpse of the whole functioning “brain” that 
comprises part of our title. Experience shows that a beginning 
student who wants to know how the brain works is often drawn 
to the subject (as were the authors of this book) by fascination 
with higher functions. Thanks to the elegance of work done on 
the retina and visual cortex, it is possible to show the clear link 
between the properties of nerve cells and our visual perception. 
Moreover, this information can evoke curiosity about succeeding 
chapters, which deal with the cellular, biophysical, and molecular 
properties of nerve cells. 
A second major change is in the number of authors. From 
two, then three and four, we have now grown to six authors. In 
the last years the amount of new information that is produced 
and the number of new techniques that must be described have 
grown faster than ever. As a result, the choices that have to be 
made about what to include or leave out are so sophisticated that 
it would be a full-time task beyond the capabilities of two or three 
neuroscientists (especially if they still wished to continue their 
research and get grants). Nevertheless, as in the past, we have 
aimed to maintain a consistent, continuous, narrative style. As in 
the past, we hope to make the whole book appear to the reader 
as if it were the work of a single author.

We owe special thanks to our friend and colleague, Bruce Wal-
lace, who was an author of the Third and Fourth Editions of 
this book. Although it was not possible for him to collaborate 
for this Fifth Edition, material from his previous chapters has 
been used extensively in new chapters that have been rewrit-
ten and brought up to date. His work represents an essential 
contribution and we are extremely grateful that we are able to 
retain in the text much of his scholarly, clear, and authoritative 
expositions of key topics.
We are grateful to the numerous colleagues who have encour-
aged us and influenced our thinking. We particularly thank Dr. 
Denis Baylor, who read all of the chapters. For reading individual 
chapters we thank Drs. W. Kolbinger, G. Legname, F. F. de Miguel, 
K. J. Muller, U. J. McMahan, L. Szczupak, and C. Trueta. Helpful 
discussions and advice were provided by E. Arabzadeh, S.Bensmaïa, 
D. H. Jenkinson, W. B. Kristan, Jr., D.-H. Kuo, S. R. Levinson, A. 
Mallamaci, L. Mei, M. Ruegg, W. J. Thompson, and D. Zoccolan. 
We are most grateful to colleagues who provided original plates 
and figures, including: K. Briggman, A. Brown, R. Constanzo, J. 
Fernandez, D. Furness, M. S. Graziano, L. L. Iversen, A. Kaneko, 
J. Kinnamon, E. Knudsen, S. R. Levinson, A. Mallamaci, U. J.

M. Stryker, J. Taranda, R. Vassar, D. A. Wagenaar, and D. Zoccolan.
It is a pleasure to thank Andy Sinauer, our publisher and 
friend. His remarkable sense of style, keen interest, and sound 
judgment about the contents, illustrations, and appearance of the 
book have motivated and encouraged us at every stage. We were 
fortunate to have the guidance of Sydney Carroll who was with 
us from the inception of the book and provided valuable input to 
its design and layout. We are also grateful to Kathaleen Emerson, 
Chelsea Holabird, and Azelie Aquadro who edited our text with 
great care and courtesy; Chris Small, Joan Gemme, and Marie 
Scavotto, who played major roles in producing this new edition, 
and to artist Elizabeth Morales, who transformed our drawings 
and graphs into elegant and attractive figures.
Acknowledgments

Our aim is to describe how nerve cells go about their business 
of transmitting signals, how these signals are put together, and 
how out of this integration higher functions emerge. This book 
is directed to the reader who is curious about the workings of 
the nervous system but does not necessarily have a specialized 
background in biological sciences. We illustrate the main points 
by selected examples, preferably from work in which we have first-
hand experience. This approach introduces an obvious personal 
bias and certain omissions. 
We do not attempt a comprehensive treatment of the ner-
vous system, complete with references and background material. 
Rather, we prefer a personal and therefore restricted point of view, 
presenting some of the advances of the past few decades by fol-
lowing the thread of development as it has unraveled in the hands 
of a relatively small number of workers. A survey of the table of 
contents reveals that many essential and fascinating fields have 
been left out: subjects like the cerebellum, the auditory system, 
eye movements, motor systems, and the corpus callosum, to name 
a few. Our only excuse is that it seems preferable to provide a 
coherent picture by selecting a few related topics to illustrate the 
usefulness of a cellular approach.
Throughout, we describe experiments on single cells or analyses 
of simple assemblies of neurons in a wide range of species. In 
several instances the analysis has now reached the molecular level, 
an advance that enables one to discuss some of the functional 
properties of nerve and muscle membranes in terms of specific 
molecules. Fortunately, in the brains of all animals that have been 
studied there is apparent a uniformity of principles for neuro-
logical signaling. Therefore, with luck, examples from a lobster 
or a leech will have relevance for our own nervous systems. As 
physiologists we must pursue that luck, because we are convinced 
that behind each problem that appears extraordinarily complex 
and insoluble there lies a simplifying principle that will lead to an 
unraveling of the events. For example, the human brain consists 
of over 10,000 million cells and many more connections that in 
their detail appear to defy comprehension. Such complexity is 
at times mistaken for randomness; yet this is not so, and we can 
show that the brain is constructed according to a highly ordered 
design, made up of relatively simple components. To perform all 
its functions it uses only a few signals and a stereotyped repeating 
pattern of activity. Therefore, a relatively small sampling of nerve 
cells can sometimes reveal much of the plan of the organization 
of connections, as in the visual system.
We also discuss “open-ended business,” areas that are devel-
oping and whose direction is therefore uncertain. As one might 
expect, the topics cannot at present be fitted into a neat scheme. 
We hope, however, that they convey some of the flavor that makes 
research a series of adventures. 
From Neuron to Brain expresses our approach as well as our 
aims. We work mostly on the machinery that enables neurons to 
function. Students who become interested in the nervous system 
almost always tell us that their curiosity stems from a desire to 
understand perception, consciousness, behavior, or other higher 
functions of the brain. Knowing of our preoccupation with the 
workings of isolated nerve cells or simple cell systems, they are 
frequently surprised that we ourselves started with similar motiva-
tions, and they are even more surprised that we have retained those 
interests. In fact, we believe we are working toward that goal (and 
in that respect probably do not differ from most of our colleagues 
and predecessors). Our book aims to substantiate this claim and, 
we hope, to show that we are pointed in the right direction.

About the Authors
Mathew E. Diamond, David A. Weisblat, John G. Nicholls, Paul A. Fuchs, 
A. Robert Martin, David A. Brown

David A. Brown is Professor of Phar-
macology in the Department of Neu-
roscience, Physiology and Pharmacol-
ogy at University College London. He 
was born in London in 1936 and gained 
a B.Sc. in Physiology from University 
College London and a Ph.D. from St. 
Bartholomew’s Hospital Medical Col-
lege (“Barts”) in London studying trans-
mission in sympathetic ganglia in the 
laboratory of Peter Quilliam (where he 
first met John Nicholls). He then did a 
post-doc at the University of Chicago 
where he helped design an integrated 
neurobiology course for graduate medi-
cal students. After returning to a junior 
faculty position at Barts, he subsequently 
chaired departments of Pharmacology at 
the School of Pharmacy in London and 
finally at University College. In between 
times he has worked in several labs in the 
United States and elsewhere, including 
three semesters in A. M. Brown’s De-
partment of Physiology and Biophysics 
at the University of Texas in Galveston, 
and a split year as Fogarty Scholar-in-
Residence at NIH in the labs of Michael 
Brownstein, Julie Axelrod, and Marshall 
Nirenberg. While at Galveston, he and 
Paul Adams (another ex-Barts colleague) 
discovered the M-type potassium chan-
nel, which provided new insight into the 
way neurotransmitters could alter nerve 
cell excitability by indirectly regulating a 
voltage-gated ion channel. He has since 
worked on the regulation of other ion 
channels by G protein–coupled recep-
tors and previously on the actions and 
transport of GABA. He is a Fellow of the 
Royal Society, a recipient of the Feldberg 
Prize, and has an Honorary Doctorate 
from the University of Kanazawa in Japan.
Mathew E. Diamond is Professor of 
Cognitive Neuroscience at the Interna-
tional School for Advanced Studies in 
Trieste Italy (known by its Italian acro-
nym, SISSA). He earned a Bachelor of 
Science degree in Engineering from the 
University of Virginia in 1984 and a Ph.D. 
in Neurobiology from the University of 
North Carolina in 1989. Diamond was 
a postdoctoral fellow with Ford Ebner at 
Brown University and then an assistant 
professor at Vanderbilt University before 
moving to SISSA to create the Tactile 
Perception and Learning Laboratory in 
1996. His main interest is to specify the 
relationship between neuronal activity 
and perception. The research is carried 
out mostly in the tactile whisker system 
in rodents, but some experiments at-
tempt to generalize the principles found 
in the whisker system to the processing 
of information in the human tactile sen-
sory system.
David A. Weisblat is Professor of Cell 
and Developmental Biology in the De-
partment of Molecular and Cell Biology 
at the University of California, Berkeley. 
He was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 
1949, studied biochemistry as an under-
graduate with Bernard Babior at Harvard 
College, where he was introduced to neu-
robiology in a course led by John Nicholls. 
He received his Ph.D. from Caltech for 
studies on the electrophysiology of Ascaris 
in 1976 with Richard Russell. He began 
studying leech development with Gunther 
Stent in the Department of Molecular 
Biology at Berkeley and was appointed to 
the Zoology Department there in 1983. 
As a postdoc, he developed techniques for 
cell lineage tracing by intracellular mi-
croinjection of tracer molecules. Current 
research interests include the evolution 
of segmentation mechanisms, D quad-
rant specification, and axial patterning. 
Work from his laboratory has helped to 
establish the leech Helobdella as a trac-
table representative of the super-phylum 
Lophotrochozoa, for the study of evolu-
tionary developmental biology. He has 
assisted or organized courses in Africa, 
India, Latin America, and at Woods Hole, 
Massachusetts.

Introduction to the 
Nervous System
This introduction provides a framework for approaching chapters that deal 
with signaling, development, and functions of the nervous system. Read-
ers who are curious about the brain but unfamiliar with neurobiology often 
face difficulties in coming to grips with the subject. For example, the termi-
nology of neurobiology, derived from anatomy, physics, biochemistry, and 
molecular biology, is disconcerting. But because of the elaborate structure 
of the nervous system and the specialized features of neural signaling, it is 
unavoidable.
Accordingly, the first three chapters in this book provide an introduction and 
overview of key concepts and definitions for readers who are approach-
ing neurobiology for the first time. In Chapter 1 the principal morphological, 
physiological, and molecular properties of nerve cells and their connec-
tions are described. As an example of a well-defined structure in which the 
processing of signals is now largely understood, we use the retina. A major 
advantage is that from the outset the electrical signals generated by reti-
nal cells can be directly correlated to perception; this enables features of 
the way in which we see the world to be understood at the cellular level. In 
Chapters 2 and 3 the signals are further followed from the eye to the cere-
bral cortex. There, it is shown how the meaning of the messages becomes 
transformed in a remarkable manner through precise interconnections along 
the pathway. The beauty and clarity of the experiments make it possible 
to understand the material with little background knowledge, to see where 
research on the brain is heading and to appreciate why the detailed study 
of cellular and molecular mechanisms described in the later chapters is so 
interesting and important.
Our principal objective at this stage is to enable the naive reader to think 
about higher functions from the outset and to see how they are depen-
dent on and correlated to cellular mechanisms employed by nerve cells. To 
achieve this aim, the material is presented with only essential concepts and 
facts, the rest being dealt with in later chapters.


■ CHAPTER 1
Principles of Signaling 
and Organization
I
n this chapter we have chosen the retina (see also Chapter 18) as an example to describe 
signals in nerve cells (neurons) and to correlate such signals with our perception of the outside 
world. The orderly structure of the retina, where the initial steps that lead to vision occur, allows 
us to follow, in detail, the signals from neuron to brain and to our perception of the outside world. 
This chapter presents basic information that prepares the reader to deal with detailed descriptions of 
signaling and perception that follow.
Information is transmitted in nerve cells by electrical signals. A major goal of neurobiological 
research is to decode the content of the information that these signals transmit. The meaning of the 
signals is determined by where the nerve fibers arise and where they go, as well as on the frequency 
and regularity of the signals themselves. Signals in the optic nerve carry visual information from the 
retina. Similar impulses in a sensory nerve in the fingertip convey information about touch, while 
impulses in a motor nerve give rise to a muscular movement. Within the brain, each individual nerve 
cell receives inputs from thousands of others. By integrating this information, the cell creates a new 
message that can convey a complex meaning, such as the presence of a vertical bar of light in one’s 
field of vision or the rough texture of sandpaper touched by one’s finger.
One simplifying feature is that in many areas of the nervous system (including the retina), nerve 
cells with similar properties are grouped together, often in layers or clusters. Another is that the brain 
uses stereotyped electrical signals to transmit information. These consist of changes in voltage pro-
duced by electrical currents flowing across cell membranes. Neurons use only two types of electrical 
signals: local graded potentials, which spread over short distances, and action potentials, which are 
conducted rapidly over long distances.
Information is transmitted between one neuron and the next at specialized junctions, known as 
synapses. Here the incoming signals release chemical transmitter molecules that bind to specific 
chemoreceptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell. This interaction gives rise to a local 
graded potential that excites or inhibits the cell depending on the transmitter and the corresponding 
receptors. The efficacy of synaptic transmission is modified by activity, hormones, and drugs.
During development, neurons depend on molecular signals derived from other cells. These sig-
nals determine the shape and position of each neuron, its survival, its transmitter, and the targets to 
which it connects. Once mature, most nerve cells do not divide. Molecules in the environment of a 
neuron influence its capacity for repair after injury. 

4 Chapter 1
The central nervous system (CNS) is an unresting assembly of cells that continually 
receives information, analyzes it, perceives it, and makes decisions. The brain can also 
take the initiative and produce coordinated, effective muscle contractions for swim-
ming, swallowing or singing. Throughout the following chapters, we attempt to explain 
these complex functions of the brain in terms of the underlying activity of nerve cells. 
A second aim is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which those 
signals arise. A third aim is to review the way in which structures and connections that 
subserve functions are established during development, become modified by experience, 
and repair themselves after injury. In this chapter, we summarize key concepts and es-
sential background material. 
Signaling in Simple Neuronal Circuits
Events that occur during the performance of simple reflexes can be followed and analyzed 
in detail. For example, when the tendon below the knee is tapped by a small hammer, thigh 
muscles are stretched and electrical impulses travel along sensory nerve fibers to the spinal 
cord, where motor neurons are excited, producing impulses and contractions in muscles. The 
end result is that the leg extends and the knee is straightened. Such simplified circuits are es-
sential for regulating muscular contractions that control movements of the body. In simple 
reflex behavior, in which a stimulus leads to a defined output, the roles played by the signals 
in just two types of cells—sensory and motor—can be readily understood.
Complex Neuronal Circuitry in Relation to Higher Functions
Analyzing signaling in complex pathways that involve many different types of neurons is 
far more difficult than analyzing simple reflexes. The transmission of information to the 
brain for perception of a sound, a touch, an odor, a visual image, or the execution of a 
simple voluntary movement requires the sequential activation of a multitude of cells, neu-
ron after neuron. Serious problems in the analysis of signaling and circuitry arise from the 
dense packing of nerve cells, the intricacy of their connections, and the profusion of cell 
types. The brain, unlike an organ such as the liver, consists of heterogeneous populations 
of cells. By contrast, if you have discovered how one region of the liver functions, you know 
a great deal about the liver as a whole. Knowledge of the cerebellum, however, gives you 
little idea about the workings of the retina or any other part of the central nervous system. 
Nevertheless, the retina can provide a well-defined structure for illustrating and explaining 
fundamental mechanisms that operate throughout the nervous system.
Despite the immense complexity of the nervous system, it is now possible to under-
stand many aspects of the way in which neurons act as the building blocks for perception. 
The first three chapters of this book show how one can record the activity of neurons 
in the pathway from the eye to the brain, follow signals first in cells that specifically 
respond to light, and then step by step through successive relays. As you read this page, 
signaling within the eye itself ensures that the black letters stand out from the white 
page in either the dim light in a room or the brilliant sunshine on a beach (not perhaps 
the ideal place to concentrate on this book). Specific connections in the brain create a 
single image in the mind’s eye, even though the two eyes are situated apart on the head 
and have somewhat different views of the outside world. Moreover, mechanisms exist 
to ensure that this image stays still (even though our eyes are continually making small 
movements) and to provide accurate information about the distance to the page so that 
you can turn it with your fingers.
How do the connections of nerve cells enable such phenomena to occur? Much is now 
known about how these attributes of vision stem from well-defined neuronal circuits in 
the eye and in the initial relays within the brain, but numerous questions remain about 
the relation between neuronal properties and behavior. New methods, such as functional 
magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain (abbreviated as fMRI), can reveal the 
locations of structures that become active as you read. But it is still not known how the 
neuronal signals in those regions cause you to perceive and understand the words in front 
of you. Moreover, while you are reading, you must maintain the posture of your body, head,

and arms. The brain must further ensure that the eyeball remains moist 
through continuous secretion of tears, that breathing continues, and that 
untold other involuntary and unconscious bodily tasks are carried out. A 
full description of the mechanisms underlying such integrated behavior 
is well beyond the scope of this book or, indeed, of current knowledge.
The following discussion deals with questions of how neurons are 
organized and how electrical signals arise, propagate, and spread from 
nerve cell to nerve cell. The retina serves to introduce and illustrate 
general principles that operate throughout the nervous system.
Organization of the Retina
Analysis of the visual world depends on the information coming from 
the retina—the initial stage of processing. Figure 1.1 shows pathways 
from the eye to higher centers in the brain. The optical image that falls 
on the retina is reversed by the lens but is otherwise a faithful repre-
sentation of the external world. How can this picture be translated into 
our visual experience by way of electrical signals that are initiated in the 
retina and then travel through the optic nerves? An essential concept, 
applicable at every level of the nervous system, is that for function to 
be understood one must know the anatomy of the structure involved.
Shapes and Connections of Neurons
Figure 1.2 shows the various types of cells and their arrangement in the 
vertebrate retina. Light entering the eye passes through the layers of transparent cells to 
reach the photoreceptors. Then, signals leaving the eye through the optic nerve fibers of 
ganglion cells provide the entire input for all of our vision. 
The drawing of Figure 1.2 was made by Santiago Ramón y Cajal1 before the turn of the 
twentieth century. Ramón y Cajal was one of the greatest students of the nervous system, 
selecting examples from a wide range of animals. He had an unfailing instinct for the es-
sential. An important lesson from his work is that the shape and position of a neuron, as 
well as the origin and destination of its processes in the neural network, supply valuable 
clues to its function. 
In Figure 1.2, it is apparent that the cells in the retina, like those elsewhere in the 
CNS, are densely packed. Early anatomists had to tease nervous tissue apart to see in-
dividual cells. Staining methods that impregnate every neuron are virtually useless for 
investigating cell shapes and connections because a structure like the retina appears as 
a dark blur of intertwined cells and processes. Most of Ramón y Cajal’s pictures were 
made with the Golgi staining method, which by a still unknown mechanism, stains just 
a few neurons at random out of the whole population, yet stains those few cells in their 
entirety. The electron micrograph of Figure 1.3 shows that the extracellular space sur-
rounding neurons and their supporting cells is restricted to clefts only about 25 nanometers 
(25 × 10 –9 meters) wide. 
The schematic presentation in Figure 1.2 gives an idea of the orderly arrangement 
of the retinal neurons. It is possible to distinguish the photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and 
ganglion cells. The lines of transmission are from input to output, from photoreceptors 
through to ganglion cells. In addition, two other types of cells, horizontal and amacrine, 
make transverse connections linking the pathways. How do the cells in Ramón y Cajal’s 
drawings contribute to the picture of the world we see?

ment (top) of the photoreceptor. There, it produces 
a signal that spreads to the terminal to influence the 
next cell in line. By recording electrically from each 
cell in the retinal circuit, we can follow signals step by 
step and understand how the meaning of the signals 
changes. (After Ramón y Cajal, 1995.)

Cell Body, Axons, and Dendrites
The ganglion cell shown in Figure 1.4 illustrates features shared by neurons throughout 
the nervous system. The cell body contains the nucleus and other intracellular organelles 
common to non-neuronal as well as neuronal cells. The long process that leaves the cell 
body to form connections with target cells is known as the axon. The term dendrite applies 
to branches upon which incoming fibers make connections and that act as receiving sta-
tions for excitation or inhibition. It will become apparent in later chapters that the terms 
for describing neuronal structures, particularly dendrites, are somewhat ambiguous but 
these terms are still convenient and widely used. In addition to the ganglion cell, Figure 
1.4 shows other representative neurons.
Not all neurons conform to the simple plan of the cells shown in Figure 1.4. Certain 
nerve cells do not have an axon, while others have an axon onto which incoming connections 
are made. Still others have dendrites that can conduct impulses and transmit to target cells. 
While ganglion cells conform to the caricature of a stereotyped neuron with dendrites, a 
cell body, and an axon, others in the retina do not. For example, photoreceptors do not 
have an axon or obvious dendrites (see Figure 1.2C). Activity in photoreceptors does not 
arise through input from another neuron but from an external stimulus—light. 
Techniques for Identifying Neurons and Tracing Their Connections
Although the staining technique devised by Golgi in 1873 is still widely used, many newer 
techniques have facilitated the functional identification of neurons and synaptic connections.

Karl Deiters in 1869, was dissected from 
a mammalian spinal cord. The other

dal cell is from the cortex of a mouse, 
the mitral cell from the olfactory bulb (a 
relay station in the pathway concerned 
with smell) of a rat, the Purkinje cell from 
human cerebellum, and the ganglion 
cell from mammalian retina (animal not 
specified). (After Ramón y Cajal, 1995.)

cent markers, such as Lucifer yellow, are visible as they spread through the fine processes of 
a living cell. Alternatively, other types of markers, such as the enzyme horseradish peroxi-
dase (HRP) or biocytin, can be injected; after the tissue has been processed for histology, 
the marker in the cell appears as a dense product or bright fluorescence. Neurons can also 
be stained by extracellular application of horseradish peroxidase; the enzyme is taken up 
by axon terminals and transported to the cell body. Fluorescent carbocyanine dyes placed 
close to neurons dissolve in cell membranes and diffuse over the entire surface of the cell. 
These procedures are valuable for tracing the origins and destinations of axons from one 
region of the nervous system to another. 
Antibodies have been made to characterize specific neurons, dendrites, axons, and 
synapses by selectively labeling intracellular or membrane components. Figure 1.5 
shows a specific group of retinal cells (called bipolar cells because of their shape) that 
have been labeled by an antibody to the enzyme phosphokinase C. Antibody techniques 
also provide valuable tools for following the migration and differentiation of nerve cells 
during development. A complementary approach for characterizing neurons is by in 
situ hybridization. Specific tagged probes are used to label messenger RNA that codes 
for a channel, receptor, transmitter, or structural element of a neuron. In animals such 
as fruit flies, nematode worms, zebrafish, opossums and mice, specific cells, groups of 
cells, or the entire nervous system can be labeled by the introduction of marker genes, 
driven by appropriate control elements genes into the genome. Figure 1.6 shows living 
satellite glial cells (see below) in the cerebral cortex of an immature opossum. The cells 
were selectively labeled transgenically by introduction of a specific plasmid through the 
use of a technique known as electroporation: a weak current causes the gene to become 
incorporated into one particular type of dividing cell.2 Alternatively, new strains of ani-
mals with stable transgenesis can be produced by introduction of genes into an oocyte, 
referred to as knock-out or knock-in animals.
Non-Neuronal Cells
The distinctive cell, labeled M in Figure 1.2B, represents a class of non-neuronal cells present 
in the retina. Such cells, known as glial cells (see Chapter 10), are abundant throughout the 
nervous system, and greatly outnumber neurons. Unlike neurons, they do not have axons 
or dendrites, and they have no specialized anatomical junctions with nerve cells. They play 
a number of roles in relation to neuronal signaling. For example, the axons of ganglion 
cells that run in the optic nerve conduct impulses rapidly because, once they leave the eye, 
the axons are surrounded by an insulating lipid sheath called myelin. Myelin is formed by 
glial cells that wrap themselves around axons during late stages of development. Retinal 
glial cells are known as Müller cells.

Principles of Signaling and Organization 9
Grouping of Cells According to Function
A remarkable feature of the retina is the clustering of cells according to function (see Figure 
1.2). Photoreceptors and the horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells all have their 
cell bodies and synapses situated in well-defined layers. Such layering is found in many 
regions of the brain. For example, the structure in which optic nerve fibers end (the lateral 
geniculate nucleus), consists of six readily distinguishable layers of cells. Throughout the 
nervous system, cells with similar functions are clustered in obvious circumscribed groups, 
known as nuclei (not to be confused with the cell nucleus) or ganglia (not to be confused 
with ganglion cells of the retina).
The simplified description of Figure 1.2 omits certain features of the organization of 
retinal cells. There are many distinctive types of ganglion cells, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, 
and amacrine cells, each with characteristic morphology, transmitters, and physiological 
properties. For example, the photoreceptors fall into two easily recognizable classes—the 
rods and the cones—which perform different functions. The elongated rods are extremely 
sensitive to small changes in illumination. As you read this page, the ambient light is too 
bright for the rods, which function only in dim light after a prolonged period in darkness. 
The cones respond to visual stimuli in bright ambient light. Moreover, the cones are further 
subdivided into red-, green-, or blue-sensitive photoreceptors. The amacrine cells provide an 
extreme example of cell type diversity: more than 20 types can be recognized by structural and 
physiological criteria. With few exceptions, the functional significance of this variety in cellular 
subtypes is not known. The properties and functions of these cells are described in Chapter 20.
Complexity of Connections
The arrows in Figure 1.2A indicate a through line of transmission from receptors to ganglion 
cells. Light falls on photoreceptors and generates electrical signals, which then influence 
bipolar cells. From bipolar cells, signals are conveyed to ganglion cells and then to higher 
centers in the brain that give rise to our perception of the outside world. 
In reality, the picture is again far more complex. For example, there is a dramatic 
reduction in numbers from receptors to ganglion cells. More than 100 million photo-
receptors provide input to just 1 million ganglion cells, by way of interposed cells. Each 
individual ganglion cell therefore receives inputs from many photoreceptors (convergence). 
Similarly, when the axon of a single ganglion cell reaches the next relay station in the 
lateral geniculate nucleus, it branches extensively to supply many target cells (divergence, 
see Figure 1.14). 
In addition, other arrows could be inserted into Figure 1.2A that point sideways to 
indicate interactions among cells in the same layer (lateral connections) and even in the 
reverse direction—for example, from horizontal cells back toward photoreceptors (recurrent 
connections). Such convergent, divergent, lateral, and recurrent connections are consistent 
features of pathways elsewhere in the nervous system. Thus, the simple step-by-step process-
ing of signals is dramatically influenced by parallel and feedback interactions.

Signaling in Nerve Cells
All nerve cells have a resting potential: the inside of the cell is negative with respect to the 
outside (extracellular) solution by a little less than a tenth of a volt. All electrical signals 
generated in nerve cells are superimposed on the resting potential. Some signals depolar-
ize the cell membrane, making the inside less negative; others hyperpolarize it, making it 
more negative.
Electrical signals of nerve cells fall into two main classes. The first consists of local 
graded potentials. These are generated by extrinsic physical stimuli, such as light falling 
on a photoreceptor in the eye, sound waves deforming a hair cell in the ear, or a pressure 
of an object against a sensory nerve ending in the skin, or by activity at synapses (i.e. the 
junctions between nerve cells and their targets). Synapses are discussed later in the chapter. 
Local potentials vary in amplitude, depending on the strength of the activating signal. They 
usually spread only a short distance from their site of origin, because they depend on the 
passive electrical properties of the nerve cells.
Action potentials (also referred to as nerve impulses), constitute the second major category 
of electrical signals. Action potentials are initiated when localized graded potentials are suf-
ficiently large to depolarize the cell membrane beyond a critical level (called the threshold). 
Once initiated, action potentials can propagate rapidly over long distances—for example, 
along the axons of ganglion cells in the optic nerve from the eye to the lateral geniculate 
nucleus on the way to the cortex, or from a motor cell in the spinal cord to a muscle in the 
leg. Unlike local graded potentials, action potentials are fixed in amplitude and duration, 
like the dots in a code. Signal transmission through the retina can be summarized by the 
following simplified scheme:
Light → local graded signal in photoreceptor → local graded signaling
bipolar cell → local graded potential in ganglion cell → action potential 
in ganglion cell → conduction to higher centers
Universality of Electrical Signals
An important feature of electrical signals is that they are virtually identical in all nerve 
cells of the body, whether they: (1) carry commands for movement, (2) transmit messages 
about colors, shapes, or painful stimuli, or (3) interconnect various portions of the brain. 
A second important feature of signals is that they are so similar in different animals that 
even a sophisticated investigator is unable to tell with certainty whether a record of an ac-
tion potential is derived from the nerve fiber of whale, mouse, monkey, worm, tarantula, 
or professor. In this sense, action potentials can be considered to be stereotyped units. They 
are the universal coins for the exchange of information in all nervous systems that have 
been investigated. In the human brain, it is the great number of cells (probably 1010 to 1012 
neurons) and the diversity of connections, rather than the types of signals, that accounts 
for the complexity of the tasks that can be carried out.
This idea was expressed in 1868 by the German physicist–biologist Hermann von 
Helmholtz. Starting from first principles, long before the facts as we know them were 
available, Helmholtz reasoned that:
The nerve fibers have often been compared with telegraphic wires traversing a 
country, and the comparison is well fitted to illustrate the striking and important 
peculiarity of their mode of action. In the network of telegraphs we find everywhere 
the same copper or iron wires carrying the same kind of movement, a stream of 
electricity, but producing the most different results in the various stations according 
to the auxiliary apparatus with which they are connected. At one station the effect is 
the ringing of a bell, at another a signal is moved, at a third a recording instrument 
is set to work…In short, every one of the…different actions which electricity is ca-
pable of producing may be called forth by a telegraphic wire laid to whatever spot we 
please, and it is always the same process in the wire itself which leads to these diverse 
consequences…All the difference which is seen in the excitation of different nerves 
depends only upon the difference of the organs to which the nerve is united and to 
which it transmits the state of excitation.3

Techniques for Recording Signals from Neurons with Electrodes
For certain problems, it is useful to record the electrical activity from a single neuron or 
even a single channel in the cell membrane of a neuron; for other problems, one needs 
to survey the activity in many neurons, all at the same time. The following description 
summarizes briefly key techniques for recording neuronal activity discussed throughout 
this book. 
Recordings of action potentials were first made in the early twentieth century with fine 
silver wires placed on the trunk of a peripheral nerve. Currents flowing between one pair 
of electrodes were used to stimulate nerve fibers, while a second pair of electrodes placed 
some distance away recorded an extracellular voltage signal produced by the resulting nerve 
cell activity. The voltage signal reflected the summed action potentials of many fibers (a 
compound action potential). Within the central nervous system, recordings from a neuron 
can be made with an extracellular electrode, which consists of a single wire insulated down 
to an exposed conducting tip or of a glass capillary filled with salt solution (Figure 1.7A). 
One can also record from many individual neurons simultaneously (on the order of 100) 
by positioning an array of electrodes in a particular area of the central nervous system.4
Intracellular microelectrodes can be used to measure the resting membrane potential of 
neurons and to record local potentials and action potentials generated in the cell membrane. 
Such microelectrodes are usually made of glass drawn to a fine-diameter tip (0.1 µm or 
smaller) and filled with a salt solution. The electrode is inserted through the cell membrane 
with the aid of a micromanipulator (Figure 1.7B). The cell membrane forms a tight seal 
around the glass so that the integrity of the cell is not disturbed. Microelectrodes are also 
used for passing electrical currents across the cell membrane or for injecting molecules 
into the cytoplasm.
An alternative is to measure the membrane potential by a procedure known as whole-
cell patch recording (Figure 1.7C). A larger pipette with a polished tip of approximately 1 
µm is applied to the surface of the cell, where it fuses with the membrane to form a tight 
seal. After the membrane within the pipette tip has been ruptured, the fluid in the pipette 
and the intracellular fluid become a single electrical compartment. 
Noninvasive Techniques for Recording 
and Stimulating Neuronal Activity
By the use of optical recording techniques, we can follow signaling in suitable prepara-
tions. Specially fabricated dyes that bind to the cell membrane change their light absor-
bance during changes in membrane potential. Other dyes measure changes in the level of

Techniques. (A) The tip of a fine wire 
electrode is located close to a nerve cell 
in the cortex. (The wire above the tip is 
insulated.) Extracellular recording allows 
one to record from a single cell or from a 
group of cells. (B) Intracellular recordings 
are made with a fluid-filled glass capil-
lary that has a tip of less than 1 μm in 
diameter, which is inserted into a neuron 
across the cell membrane. At rest, there 
is a potential difference of about 70 mV 
between the inside and outside of a cell, 
the inside being negative with respect to 
the outside. This difference is known as 
the resting potential. (C) Intracellular re-
cordings are also made with patch elec-
trodes. A patch electrode has a larger 
tip than that of an intracellular microelec-
trode; the tip makes an extremely tight 
seal with the cell membrane. If the seal is 
intact, the currents that flow as a single 
ion channel in the membrane opens or 
closes can be recorded. Alternatively, 
as shown here, the cell membrane can 
be ruptured to allow the diffusion of 
molecules between the pipette and the 
intracellular fluid of the cell (called whole-
cell patch clamp).

calcium inside nerve cells.5 Changes in light emission by dyes that 
are fluorescent provide an index of activity occurring in a single 
neuron or in populations of neurons. A recording made from a 
large squid axon by a voltage-sensitive dye is shown in Figure 1.8. 
The optically recorded signal faithfully reproduces the voltage 
changes recorded by an electrode. With suitable dyes, microscopes 
and cameras, one can record the ongoing activity of hundreds of 
nerve cells simultaneously within a discrete region of the brain. By 
genetic engineering, it is now possible to introduce genes that will 
give rise to optical signals in active nerve cells without using dyes. 
Recordings that depend on changes in emission of light by active 
cells are most simply made in isolated tissues maintained alive in 
a culture dish or in intact CNS near the surface. Optical signals 
generated by deeply embedded cells are difficult to observe through 
overlying layers of tissue, unless one uses a laser technique, known 
as 2-photon microscopy. 
Other noninvasive techniques are able to provide an indirect 
measure of activity in groups of neurons deep in the brain as 
well as in superficial neuronal layers. These techniques, known as 
positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),6
allow us to determine which regions of the awake, human brain are active when stimuli 
are presented, thoughts are pursued, or movements are initiated. They are particularly 
important in mapping brain regions involved in complex cognitive functions, such as 
reading, remembering, or imagining. The methods now available have a spatial resolution 
limited to hundreds of microns and seconds. Hence, present day imaging methods of the 
human brain cannot provide information about the exact cellular location or timing of 
messages that are being carried by active neurons. It is realistic to hope that this will be 
possible in the future since, year-by-year, the temporal and spatial resolution of imaging 
improve. The fMRI image in Figure 1.9 shows the location of activity moving from the eye 
to the cortex in response to a visual stimulus.
The overall activity of the eye and brain can also be observed in the electroretinogram 
and electroencephalogram. These techniques are whole-organ electrical signals detected 
with electrodes placed on the surface of the body. They have poor spatial resolution and 
are used mainly to diagnose disorders of function, such as epilepsy.7 
Stimulation of an area in the brain or of a peripheral nerve is now practicable by a 
noninvasive technique, called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which can be used 
in conscious patients or in animals. Stimulation of appropriate regions can cause the subject 
to see lights or induce movements. Strong magnetic fields are applied to the surface of the 
skull by means of a coil.8 One can, for example, use fMRI to locate a discrete cortical region 
that becomes activated when the person perceives the direction of movement of dots on 
a computer monitor. When the same region is excited by transcranial magnetic stimula-

tion, the subject has difficulty in perceiving motion. In this way, the combination of 
imaging and TMS can be used to identify a brain area that is potentially involved in 
a perceptual task—and then to prove the point by silencing that specific brain area 
and simultaneously disrupting perception. 
Spread of Local Graded Potentials and Passive 
Electrical Properties of Neurons
Implicit in the wiring diagram of Ramón y Cajal (see Figure 1.2A) is the idea that 
changes in illumination of the retina influence the activity of the photoreceptors and 
eventually the fibers leaving the eye. For this influence 
to take effect, signals must spread not only from cell 
to cell, but along a cell, from one end to the other. 
How, for example, does the electrical signal generated 
at one end of the bipolar cell (in contact with the 
photoreceptor), spread along its length to reach the 
terminal that is close to the ganglion cell?
To answer this question, it is useful to consider the 
relevant structural components that carry the signals. 
A neuron, such as a bipolar cell, can be considered to 
be a long tube filled with a watery solution of salts 
(dissociated into positively and negatively charged 
ions) and proteins, separated from the extracellular 
solution by an insulating membrane. The intracellular 
and extracellular solutions have the same osmolarity 
but different ionic compositions. The cell membrane, 
a lipid, is relatively impermeable to the ions on either 
side, but ions can move through specific ion channels 
formed by proteins that span the membrane. Electrical 
and chemical signals cause the various ion channels 
for sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride to open 
or close. Detailed information about the molecular 
structure of ion channels, and the way in which they 
allow the flow of ions, is presented in Chapters 4 and 5.
The structure of a neuron in the retina or else-
where limits its ability to conduct electrical signals. 
First, the intracellular fluid, or axoplasm, is about 
107 times worse than a metal wire as a conductor of 
electricity because both the density of charge carriers 
(ions) and their mobility in the intracellular fluid are 
much lower than those of free electrons in a wire. 
Second, the movement of currents along the axon for 
any great distance is hampered by the fact that the 
membrane is not a perfect insulator. Consequently, 
any current flowing along the fiber is gradually lost 
to the outside by leakage through ion channels in 
the membrane. 
Passively conducted electrical signals, then, are 
severely attenuated and limited to a short length of 
nerve fiber, 1 to 2 mm at most. For example, a local 
potential generated in a small sensory fiber in the big 
toe will spread only about one thousandth the distance 
that must be traversed for the signal to reach the spinal 
cord. In addition, when such a signal is brief, its time 
course may be severely distorted and its amplitude fur-
ther attenuated by the electrical capacitance of the cell 
membrane. Nevertheless, graded localized potentials 
(Figure 1.10) provide the essential mechanisms for

FIGURE 1.10 Localized Graded Potentials.
Intracellular recordings are made from (A) a 
bipolar cell and (B) a ganglion cell with micro-
electrodes. (A) When light is absorbed by the 
photoreceptors, it gives rise to a signal that in 
turn produces a localized, graded response 
in the bipolar cell. The resting potential across 
the membrane is reduced (the trace moves 
in an upward direction)—an effect known as 
a depolarization. The size of the signal in the 
bipolar cell depends on the intensity of illumina-
tion, hence the term graded. The depolariza-
tion spreads to the far end of the bipolar cell 
passively. As it spreads, it becomes smaller 
in amplitude owing to the poor conducting 
properties of neurons. At the terminal of the 
bipolar cell, depolarization causes the release 
of chemical transmitter. (B) The transmitter pro-
duces a local graded potential in the ganglion 
cell. Because it is localized, the potential can-
not spread for more than 1 mm (at most) along 
the axon. Whereas the bipolar cell is short 
enough for a local potential to spread to its 
endings, the ganglion cell has an axon several 
centimeters long. In these illustrations, the local 
potentials were recorded from the cell bodies 
and were produced by transmitters acting on 
the dendrites. (A after Kaneko and Hashimoto, 
1969; B after Baylor and Fettiplace, 1977.)

initiating propagated signals. The fact that nerve fibers are extremely small (between 1 and 
20 µm in diameter in vertebrates) further reduces the amount of current they can carry.9 
Spread of Potential Changes in Photoreceptors and Bipolar Cells
It is only because photoreceptor and bipolar cells are so short that local, graded signals can 
spread effectively from one end of the cell to the other. The electrical signal that results 
from illumination of the photoreceptor is generated in the outer segment of the rod or 
the cone. From there, it spreads passively along the cell to its terminal on the bipolar cell. 
If photoreceptor and bipolar cells were longer, centimeters or even millimeters in length, 
local potentials would fizzle out long before reaching the terminal and would not be able 
to influence the next cell. Photoreceptor and bipolar cells thereby constitute exceptions to 
the general rule that action potentials are necessary to carry information along the length 
of a cell. Ganglion cells, on the other hand, must generate action potentials to send signals 
along their elongated axons in the optic nerve. 
The electrical recordings made from the neurons shown in Figure 1.10 were made 
from their cell bodies. The local potentials originate from synaptic actions on dendrites at 
a distance and spread passively to the recording site.
Properties of Action Potentials
One essential feature of the action potential is that it is a triggered, regenerative, all-or-
nothing event. An action potential is initiated in a ganglion cell by the signals impinging 
on it from bipolar and amacrine cells, provided these signals are sufficient to depolarize 
the ganglion cell to threshold. Once initiated, the amplitude and duration of the action 
potential are not determined by the amplitude and duration of the stimulus. Larger 
stimulating currents do not give rise to larger action potentials, and stimuli of longer 
duration do not prolong the action potential. Figure 1.11shows that the action potential 
is a brief electrical pulse about 0.1 V in amplitude. At its peak, the voltage across the 
membrane reverses sign (i.e., the inside becomes positive). The action potential lasts for 
about 0.001 seconds (1 millisecond) and moves rapidly along the nerve fiber from one 
end to the other. 
The entire action potential sequence must be completed before another action po-
tential can be initiated at the same site. Thus, after each action potential, there is a period 
of enforced silence, usually lasting for a few milliseconds (the refractory period), during 
which a second impulse cannot be initiated. The maximal possible frequency of repeated 
action potentials is therefore limited by the refractory period.

FIGURE 1.11 Action Potential recorded from 
a retinal ganglion cell with an intracellular micro-
electrode. When the stimulus, in this case current 
injected into the cell through the microelectrode, 
causes a depolarizing response that exceeds the 
threshold, the all-or-nothing action potential is 
initiated. During the action potential, the inside of 
the neuron becomes positive. The action potential 
propagates along the axon of the ganglion cell to 
its terminal, where it causes transmitter to be re-
leased. (After Baylor and Fettiplace, 1977.)

of Perception. Clarendon, Oxford, England.
Propagation of Action Potentials along Nerve Fibers
The action potential itself causes electrical currents to spread passively ahead of 
itself along the axon. Although the resulting depolarization falls off steeply with 
distance, it nevertheless exceeds threshold. Hence, the action potential provides 
an electrical stimulus to the adjacent region of the axon. In this way, the impulse 
is reborn unchanged or “regenerated” as it propagates along the axon. The fast-
est action potentials in the human body travel in the largest fibers at a speed of 
about 120 meters/second (430 kilometers/hour or 270 miles/hour). They are 
therefore capable of conveying information rapidly over a long distance—for 
example it takes about 10 milliseconds for a motor fiber to conduct its action 
potentials over one meter from the spinal cord to a toe.
Action Potentials as the Neural Code
Given that the action potential is fixed in amplitude, how is information about 
the intensity of a stimulus conveyed? Intensity is coded by frequency of firing. 
A more effective visual stimulus produces a greater local potential and, as a 
consequence, a higher frequency of firing in ganglion cells (Figure 1.12). The 
phenomenon was first described by Adrian,10 who showed that the frequency of 
action potential firing in a sensory nerve in the skin is a measure of the intensity 
of the stimulus. In addition, Adrian observed that stronger stimuli applied to 
the skin give rise to activity in a larger number of sensory fibers.
Synapses: The Sites for Cell-to-Cell Communication
The structure at which one cell hands its information to the next is known as 
a synapse. Through synaptic interactions, neurons such as ganglion cells take account of 
signals that arise from many photoreceptors and have fed onto horizontal, bipolar, and 
amacrine cells, thereby creating new messages. Study of the processes underlying synaptic 
transmission constitutes a major theme in modern neurobiology because these mechanisms 
are responsible for integration and plasticity and are the targets of many therapeutic drugs.
Chemically Mediated Synaptic Transmission

aptic amacrine cell diffuses across the cleft to interact with receptors 
on the postsynaptic ganglion cell. (Micrograph kindly provided by Y.

from the bipolar cells by a cleft that contains extracellular fluid. This space is cannot be 
traversed by currents generated in the photoreceptor. Instead, the photoreceptor termi-
nal releases a neurotransmitter that is stored in presynaptic vesicles. The transmitter, the 
amino acid glutamate in this case, diffuses across the cleft to interact with specific protein 
molecules, known as receptors, which are embedded in the membranes of the postsynaptic 
bipolar cells. (This terminology can—but should not—lead to confusion: The term recep-
tor, as used here, means a chemoreceptor molecule and is not the same concept as that of 
a sensory receptor cell that responds to external physical stimuli, such as a photorecep-
tor.) The transmitters in a neuron and the receptors on its surface can be identified and 
visualized by a variety of techniques, including antibody labeling and genetic transfection 
of so-called reporter constructs, which lead to the production of fluorescent proteins in 
cells expressing certain transcription factors.
Activation of the receptor molecules in a bipolar cell by glutamate sets up local graded 
potentials that spread to its terminals. The more transmitter released, the higher the 
concentration in the cleft, the larger the number of activated receptors, and the larger the 
local potential. Such events occur rapidly, with a delay of only about 1 millisecond between 
the arrival of the depolarizing signal in the presynaptic terminal and the appearance of 
the synaptic potential in the target. Essential features of synaptic transmission were first 
revealed by Katz, Kuffler, and their colleagues.11 These investigators used the responses of 
receptors in muscle as a bioassay with extremely high sensitivity and time resolution for 
measuring transmitter release. Modern methods for measuring the transmitter directly 
include techniques such as voltammetry in which special carbon-coated probes produce 
graded electrical signals in response to a particular transmitter (such as serotonin), as it is 
released from a presynaptic terminal.12
Excitation and Inhibition
A feature of synaptic transmission, as exemplified by the interactions between 
photoreceptors and bipolar cells in the retina, is that the transmitter released 
by a presynaptic terminal can excite or inhibit the next cell, depending on the 
receptors that cell possesses. For example, one class of glutamate receptors 
localized to certain bipolar cells reacts to glutamate to cause an excitatory 
signal (i.e., depolarization of the cell membrane). This signal spreads pas-
sively to the bipolar cell terminals at the other end of the cell, where it causes 
liberation of transmitter. Other classes of bipolar cells contain different glu-
tamate receptors that produce a signal of the opposite sign when activated 
by glutamate (i.e., hyperpolarization of the membrane). Again, the electrical 
signal spreads along the bipolar cell, but in this case, it suppresses the release 
of transmitter. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials in ganglion cells 
are shown in Figure 1.14.
In neurons throughout the nervous system, combined excitatory and 
inhibitory inputs determine whether or not the threshold for the initiation 
of an action potential will be reached. For example, a ganglion cell, as men-
tioned, receives both excitatory and inhibitory inputs. If excitation is sufficient 
to depolarize the cell membrane to threshold, then an action potential is 
generated and its message is transmitted to the next destination; if not, no 
message is sent. In motor cells in the spinal cord, to use a different example, 
excitatory and inhibitory influences from different fibers determine whether 
or not a finger will be flexed. A motor cell of this sort receives 10,000 or more 
incoming fibers (Figure 1.15A). These fibers release transmitters that drive

individual Purkinje cell in the cerebellum receives more than 100,000 inputs.
Electrical Transmission
Although synaptic transmission between most neurons involves the release of transmitter 
molecules, the membranes of many cells in the retina and in the rest of the nervous sys-
tem are instead linked by specialized junctions. At such synapses electrical transmission 
occurs. The pre- and postsynaptic membranes are closely apposed and linked by channels 
that connect the intracellular fluids of the two cells. This close connection allows local 
electrical potentials and even action potentials to spread directly from cell to cell without 
a chemical transmitter and without delay. Metabolites and dyes can also spread from cell 
to cell. One important example in the retina is provided by the horizontal cells, which are 
electrically coupled in this way. By virtue of this property, graded depolarizing or hyperpo-
larizing potentials can spread from one horizontal cell to the next, with marked effect on 
the processing of visual information in the retina. Electrical synapses are found throughout 
the CNS of vertebrates and invertebrates. They also connect non-neuronal cells of other 
tissues in the body.
Modulation of Synaptic Efficacy
Chemically mediated synaptic transmission shows great plasticity. Dramatic changes oc-
cur in the amount of transmitter that is released by a signal—such as an action potential 
or a local potential—that invades a presynaptic terminal. The photoreceptors in the retina 
provide an example: The amount of the transmitter glutamate that is released by a rod or 
a cone in response to a standard light stimulus can be increased or decreased by feedback 
to the terminal from horizontal cells. The horizontal cells themselves are influenced by 
other photoreceptors. This feedback loop plays a critical role in the way the eye adapts to 
different levels of illumination.
Other mechanisms that influence transmitter release depend on the history of impulse 
activity. During and after a train of impulses in a neuron, the amount of transmitter it 
releases can increase or decrease dramatically, depending on the frequency and duration 
of the activity. Modulation of efficacy can also be postsynaptic in origin. Long- and short-
term plasticity are the focus of intense contemporary research.

Integrative Mechanisms
All neurons within the CNS take account of influences arriving from diverse inputs to 
create their own new messages with new meanings. The term integration was introduced 
by Sherrington13 (who also coined the words “synapse” and “receptive field”). Sherrington 
revealed many of the essential concepts that permeate modern neurobiology by experiments 
in which he measured the contractions of muscles, before electrical recordings were possible.
Once again, retinal ganglion cells provide an excellent example of integration. Kuffler14
was the first to show that a ganglion cell responds best to a small light spot or dark spot that 
falls on a few receptors in a particular region of the retina. Previously investigators had used 
flashes of bright light in an attempt to achieve maximal stimulation of the retina. Massive 
stimulation of this type applied to the retina, the ear, and other sensory systems gives little 
information about how information is processed with fine discrimination under normal 
conditions. Kuffler showed that a small region of illumination gives rise to a brisk discharge 
of action potentials (Figure 1.16A). A larger spot shone over the same part of the retina is 
far less effective: this is because an additional group of receptors arranged circumferentially 
around the first set also responds to the change in illumination. The action of these pho-
toreceptors on bipolar cells gives rise to inhibition of ganglion cell firing (Figure 1.16B). 
Summation of the excitatory effect of a small central spot and the inhibitory effect from 
the surrounding region causes the ganglion cell to be relatively insensitive to diffuse light 
(Figure 1.16C). In a second major category of ganglion cells, the optimal visual stimulus 
consists of a small dark spot surrounded by light. 
The meaning of the signal in a ganglion cell has thereby become more complex than 
information simply about light or dark. Instead, the action potentials report the presence 
of a contrasting pattern of light in a particular region of the visual field. This occurs be-
cause each ganglion cell is influenced, albeit indirectly, not by one photoreceptor but by 
many. For any given ganglion cell, the specific connections through bipolar, horizontal,

ceptors gives rise to excitation and a brisk discharge of action potentials. (B) Light presented as 
a ring, or annulus, to illuminate a circumferential group of photoreceptors gives rise to inhibition of

nation is equivalent to excitation, which gives rise to a burst of action potentials. (C) Illumination of 
both groups of receptors causes integration of excitation and inhibition and a weak discharge of 
action potentials. (After Kuffler, 1953.)

and amacrine cells determine the pattern of light that is required for it to discharge action 
potentials (see Chapter 20).
Complexity of the Information Conveyed by Action Potentials
At a distance of only three synaptic relays beyond the retina, even more sophisticated in-
formation about the visual world is provided by the action potentials in cortical nerve cells. 
Hubel and Wiesel15 showed that cortical neurons do not respond simply to light or dark on 
the retina. Instead, their activation depends on the pattern of retinal illumination. Specific, 
distinctive patterns are the required and most effective stimuli for different types of corti-
cal cells. For example, one type of cortical cell in the visual pathway responds selectively 
to a bar of light with a specific orientation (vertical, oblique, or horizontal), moving in a 
particular direction in a particular part of the visual field (vertical in the case of the cell 
illustrated in Figure 1.17). The firing of these cells is not influenced by diffuse light or by a 
bar of an inappropriate orientation or one moving in the wrong direction. Hence, its action 
potentials provide precise information about the visual stimulus to higher centers in the 
brain. This increase in the meaning attributed to a stereotyped action potential is explained 
by the precise connections of lower-order cells to the cortical cell and the way in which 
the cortical cell integrates incoming signals by summation of localized graded potentials.
The transformation of information can be simply summarized as follows:
• A signal in a photoreceptor indicates a change in light intensity in that area of the field 
of vision.
• A signal in a ganglion cell indicates the presence of contrast.
• A signal in a cortical neuron indicates the presence of an oriented bar or edge of light.
Complex integration occurs in other sensory systems. Thus, the position and direction of 
a mechanical stimulus, moving along a fingertip, act as selective stimuli for particular cells 
in the region of the cerebral cortex that are concerned with tactile stimuli. Mice, which 
use their whiskers much as we use our fingertips, have cells in the cortex that not only can 
distinguish the direction of motion but the roughness or smoothness of a surface. 
Two important conclusions about signaling in the nervous system are: (1) nerve cells 
act as the building blocks for perception and (2) the abstract significance of the message 
can be extremely complex, depending on the number of inputs a neuron receives. It turns 
out that the progressive integration of information derived from lower order units can lead 
to the generation of highly complex and specific stimulus requirements for higher order 
central neurons. For example, later it will be shown (see Chapter 23) that specific cells exist 
in visual association areas that respond selectively to a face. In addition, the temporal group-
ing and patterning of impulses can provide information about the quality of the stimulus.
Reverse Traffic of Signals from Higher to Lower Centers
Implicit in the discussion of information transfer in this chapter is the concept of linear 
progression from receptors to perception or from motor commands to movement. It will 
be shown however that extensive signaling also occurs in the opposite direction: from the 
brain towards sensory receptors as well as from each higher center back towards the lower 
centers from which it received its inputs. In a few cases, the significance of descending 
information is understood, but in general, the functional role remains to be discovered.16

(B–E) Bars with different orientations or diffuse light fail to evoke action potentials. The cortical cell

Higher Functions of the Brain
In spite of the alarming flow of new treatises that appear day by day on consciousness, 
learning, and memory, only rudimentary information is available at present about the 
way in which the brain creates a complete image of the outside world, with its forms, 
colors, depth, and motion, or about the way in which it composes and executes complex, 
integrated movements of the body. Indeed, this open frontier is one of the most appealing 
aspects of research on the nervous system. We do not know how the tennis player runs to 
hit the ball in exactly the right place on the racket, so as to drive it to the far corner of the 
court, or how the coordinated finger and arm movements required for playing the violin 
are initiated or executed—let alone how we think and feel. 
New approaches that shed light on mechanisms for the individual steps involved in 
higher functions often have their origin in psychophysical experiments. For example, tests 
on normal human subjects made with precise quantitative stimuli have shown that under 
suitable conditions, a person can detect the arrival of single quanta of light on photorecep-
tors of the eye. By carefully designed behavioral experiments made on rats and mice, one can 
produce symptoms of stress and anxiety resembling those seen in patients. As a further step, 
it then becomes possible to assess which brain structures and mechanisms play a part in such 
disorders of higher functions. In addition to the insights that these experiments provide about 
our emotions and our minds, they are essential for the development of new drugs that can 
mitigate the suffering of patients. Moreover, information flows back from the clinic toward 
basic research. Clinical observations, particularly on patients with discrete circumscribed 
lesions, provide unparalleled insights into mechanisms of perception, movement, and speech.
Cellular and Molecular Biology of Neurons
Like other types of cells, neurons possess the cellular machinery for metabolic activity for 
synthesizing intracellular and membrane proteins, and for distributing them to precise 
locations in the cell. Each type of neuron synthesizes, stores, and releases its characteristic 
transmitter(s). The receptors for specific transmitters are located at well-defined sites on the 
postsynaptic cell under the presynaptic terminals. In addition, other membrane proteins, 
known as pumps and transporters, maintain the constancy of the internal and external 
milieu of the cell. The presynaptic terminals of optic nerve fibers of ganglion cells (like 
those of photoreceptors and bipolar cells, and indeed like all presynaptic nerve terminals) 
contain in their membranes specific channels through which calcium ions can flow. Cal-
cium entry triggers the release of transmitters and can activate intracellular cascades of 
enzymes and regulate numerous other cellular processes. 
A major specialization in the cell biology of neurons, compared to other types of cells, 
arises from the presence of the axon. Axons do not have adequate machinery for synthesiz-
ing all the proteins they need. Hence, essential molecules are carried to the nerve terminals 
by a process known as axonal transport, often over long distances. Molecules required for 
maintenance of structure and function, as well as for the appropriate membrane channels, 
travel from the cell body in this way; similarly, molecules taken up at the ending are carried 
back to the cell body.
Neurons are different from most other cells in that, with few exceptions, they cannot 
divide after differentiation. As a result, in an adult human being, neurons in the central 
nervous system that have been destroyed usually cannot be replaced. 
Signals for Development of the Nervous System
The high degree of organization in a structure such as the retina poses a fascinating prob-
lem. Whereas a computer requires a brain to wire it, the brain must establish and tune its 
own connections. What seems so puzzling is how the proper assembly of the parts endows 
the brain with its extraordinary properties. 
In the mature retina, each cell type is situated in the correct layer—or even sublayer—
and makes the correct connections with the appropriate targets. This arrangement is a 
prerequisite for function. For ganglion cells to develop, for example, precursor cells must

divide, migrate, differentiate into the appropriate shapes with the appropriate properties, 
and receive specific synapses. The axons must find their way over long distances through 
the optic nerve to end in the appropriate layer of the next relay station. Similar processes 
must occur for the various divisions of the nervous system so that complex structures 
required for function are formed.
Study of the mechanisms by which highly complex structures, such as the retina, are 
formed presents a key problem in modern neurobiology. An understanding of how intricate 
wiring diagrams are established in development often provides clues about function and 
about the genesis of functional disorders. In other words, if you know how an electrical 
circuit has been wired, you may be able to understand what the components are doing and, 
consequently, you may be able to repair it. Certain specific molecules are essential for dif-
ferentiation, outgrowth of axons, pathfinding, synapse formation, and survival of neurons. 
Such molecules are now being identified at an ever-increasing rate, and their mechanisms 
of action are being studied. Interestingly, molecular signals that give rise to the outgrowth 
of axons and formation of connections can be regulated by electrical signals. Activity plays 
a role in determining the pattern of connections.
Genetic approaches have made it possible to identify genes that control the differentia-
tion of entire organs, such as the eye as a whole. Gehring17 and his colleagues have studied 
the expression of a gene in the fruit fly (Drosophila), known as eyeless, that controls the 
development of the eyes. After deletion of this gene in the germline, eyes fail to develop 
in the progeny for generation after generation. Homologous genes in mice and humans 
(known as small eye and aniridia, respectively) share extensive sequence identity and have 
similar developmental functions. If the fly eyeless gene or the mammalian homologue of 
the gene is introduced and overexpressed in the fly, it develops multiple ectopic eyes over 
its antennae, wings, and legs (Figure 1.18). The gene can therefore orchestrate the forma-
tion of an entire eye, in a mouse or a fly, even though the eyes themselves have completely 
different structures and properties. 
Regeneration of the Nervous System after Injury
Not only does the nervous system wire itself when it is developing, but it can also restore 
certain connections after injury (again something your computer cannot do!). For ex-
ample, axons in an arm can grow back after the nerve has been injured so that function 
can be restored; the hand can once again be moved, and sensation returns. Similarly, in a 
frog, fish, or an invertebrate like the leech, lesions in the central nervous system are fol-
lowed by axon regeneration and functional recovery. After the optic nerve of a frog or a 
fish has been cut, fibers grow back to the brain and the animal can see again. However, in 
the adult mammalian CNS regeneration does not occur. The molecular signals that cause 
this failure are not yet known.

Signaling in the 
Visual System
N
euronal signals that are evoked by light begin in the retina. They are sent by ganglion 
cell axons to a relay, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and then to higher centers that 
produce our perception of scenes with objects and background, movement, shade, and 
color. Signaling at each level is best analyzed in terms of the receptive fields of neurons. A recep-
tive field in the visual system is defined as the area of the retinal surface (or corresponding region 
of the visual field) that, upon illumination, enhances or inhibits the activity of a neuron. A useful 
strategy for analyzing the visual system is to define the optimal pattern of illumination and the 
receptive field for each neuron. 
The receptive fields of most retinal ganglion cells and neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus 
consist of small circular areas on the retina. The cells respond to contrast rather than diffuse il-
lumination. Geniculate axons project to form a new map of the visual field in primary visual cortex. 
The receptive fields of neurons in the primary visual cortex for the most part consist of lines, bars, 
or edges with a particular orientation. Cortical neurons give no response to diffuse illumination. 
The optimal stimulus for a simple cell is an oriented edge or bar, which may be light or dark, with 
a defined width, shining on a precise place in the retina. Complex cells also respond to oriented 
bars but their discharges are evoked over a wider area than the simple cells. End inhibition, which 
is a decrease in the response of a neuron as the length of an image increases, gives rise to more 
elaborate stimulus requirements, such as a corner or a line that stops. Most cortical cells respond 
to appropriate illumination of both eyes. Receptive fields of simple cells result from convergence of 
a number of geniculate afferents with adjoining field centers. The response properties of complex 
cells depend on inputs from simple and other cortical cells. Cortical neurons detect only the edges 
of white or black patterns on a background with inverse contrast. The overall levels of illumination 
are measured by specialized retinal ganglion cells that project to areas other than the visual cortex.
The progression of receptive field properties from retina to complex cells suggests that inputs 
from one level are combined to produce more abstract requirements at the next. Information also 
flows in the opposite direction, for example from cortex to LGN, from one cortical layer to another 
and back. Throughout the visual pathways, the emphasis is on contrast, color, movement, depth, 
and boundaries, rather than on light detection. This distinction enables the nervous system to fo-
cus on what is important to the animal and to jettison irrelevant information in the visual fields. 

24 Chapter 2
This chapter describes the functional properties of neurons at successive stages in the vi-
sual pathways. We deal first with the output of the eye; second, with the next relay station, 
the lateral geniculate nucleus; and then with the primary visual cortex, the initial receiv-
ing center for visual information. Our aim is to show how neuronal activity is related to 
higher functions, such as visual perception, using as background knowledge only the basic 
information provided in Chapter 1. Chapter 3 shows in greater detail how structure and 
function are intimately related at every level (see also Chapter 22). 
Experiments performed in recent years have produced an overwhelming body of work 
on psychophysics, color vision, dark adaptation, retinal pigments, transduction, transmit-
ters, and the organization of the retina (see Chapter 20). Each of these topics can form the 
basis of a self-contained monograph (see the Suggested Reading section at the end of the 
chapter). The same applies to comparative aspects of the visual system in invertebrates, 
lower vertebrates, and mammals. Since a comprehensive account is not possible within 
the scope of this book, we have selected experiments that provide a continuous thread, 
extending from the properties of cells in the retina to mechanisms that underlie perception.
Pathways in the Visual System
The initial step in visual processing is the formation on each retina of a sharp image of 
the outside world. Essential for clear vision are: (1) correct focus of the image by ad-
justment of the curvature of the lens (accommodation), (2) regulation of light entering 
the eye by the diameter of the pupil, and (3) convergence of the two eyes to ensure that 
matching images fall on corresponding points of both retinas. Our vision depends criti-
cally on the region of the visual field that is being analyzed (Figure 2.1). We can read

section through the eye. Light must pass through the lens and layers of cells in order 
to reach the rod and cone photoreceptors. The fovea is a specialized area, containing 
only densely packed, slender cones. It is used for fine discrimination. In the fovea, the 
superficial layers of cells are spread apart and this feature permits light to have more 
direct access to the photoreceptors than elsewhere in the retina. The point at which the 
optic nerve exits the eye has no photoreceptors and constitutes a blind spot.

small print at the center of gaze, where light falls on the fovea, but not in 
the peripheral field of vision. This loss of acuity arises from the way in 
which visual information is processed; it is not the result of blurred images 
or optical distortion outside the central region.
The pathways from the eye to the cerebral cortex are illustrated in Figure 
2.2, which depicts some of the major landmarks of the visual system; this 
anatomical information constitutes the bare minimum for following the 
electrical signals as they pass from relay to relay.
The optic nerve fibers that arise from ganglion cells in the retina end on 
layers of cells in a relay station of the thalamus, which as mentioned is called 
the lateral geniculate nucleus (geniculate means bent like a knee). In each of 
the six principal layers of this structure (Figure 2.3), the outside world is rep-
resented as a coherent map of the field seen by one eye, either on the same or 
the opposite side. Geniculate axons in turn project through the optic radiation 
to the cerebral cortex. The six layers of the visual cortex and the arrangements 
of maps are dealt with in Chapter 3. For present purposes, it is sufficient to 
state that in the monkey, the optic radiation ends on a folded plate of cells 
about 2 mm thick (see Figure 2.7). This region of the brain is known as the 
primary visual cortex, or visual area 1, (also called V1), which lies posteriorly 
in the occipital lobe. Adjacent regions of cortex are also concerned with vision. 
From the primary visual cortex, the progression through the brain becomes 
ever more complex, with no end point in sight.
Figure 2.2 shows how the output from each retina divides in two at the 
optic chiasm. The right side of each retina projects to the right cerebral 
hemisphere. Because of optical reversal by the lens, the right side of each 
retina receives the image of the visual world on the left side of the head. Each 
cerebral hemisphere, therefore, sees the opposite side of the outside world. 
Accordingly, people with damage to the right cerebral hemisphere caused by 
trauma or disease become blind in the left visual field, and vice versa. Other 
pathways that branch off to the midbrain are not described here. They are 
concerned primarily with regulating eye movements, pupillary responses, and 
circadian rhythms (see Chapter 17). 
Convergence and Divergence of Connections

pathway, one can exclude the possibility that information is handed on un-

each layer is supplied by only one eye and contains

changed from level to level (Figure 2.4). The neurons 
converge and diverge extensively at every stage; that is, 
each cell receives many inputs and makes connections 
with a number of other cells (see Chapter 1). Just as a 
ganglion cell is supplied (indirectly) from numerous 
rods and cones, so a neuron in the LGN receives its 
input from many ganglion cells and it in turn supplies 
many cortical neurons. Hence, as impulses travel to the 
cortex and within the cortex itself there occurs a fun-
neling and, simultaneously, a dispersal of information. 
Converging impulses of different origin are integrated 
at each stage into an entirely new message that takes 
account of all the inputs. Moreover, except at the level 
of the ganglion cells, information is simultaneously 
flowing in the opposite direction, for example from 
cortex down to lateral geniculate nucleus.1,2
Receptive Fields of Ganglion and 
Geniculate Cells
Concept of Receptive Fields
Diffuse flashes of light are of little or no use for assess-
ing function in the visual system. Instead, the technique 
of illuminating selected areas of the retina led to the 
concept of the receptive field. The concept has provided 
a key for understanding the significance of the signals, 
not only in the retina, but at successive stages in the 
cortex. As previously mentioned in Chapter 1, the term 
receptive field was coined originally by Sherrington in 
relation to reflex actions (see also Chapter 21); it was 
later introduced to the visual system by Hartline.3 The 
receptive field of a neuron in the visual system can be 
defined as the area of the retina from which the activity of a neuron can be influenced by light
(see also Chapter 20). Alternatively, one can define the receptive field as the region in the 
visual field, illumination of which influences the cell’s activity. By definition, illumination 
outside a receptive field produces no effect on firing. The area itself can be subdivided into 
distinct regions, some of which increase activity and others of which suppress it.
The Output of the Retina
Many years before the electrical responses of photoreceptors or bipolar cells in the retina 
could be measured, important information was obtained by recording from ganglion 
cells. Thus, the first analysis of signaling in the retina was made at the output stage, the 
end result of synaptic interactions. It was a simplification and shortcut to go straight 
to the output. 
As discussed in Chapter 1 (see Figure 1.16), retinal ganglion cells have circular receptive 
fields with concentric on and off regions. Stephen Kuffler first defined the organization 
of the receptive field in the cat visual system.4 Synaptic inputs to ganglion cells that are 
responsible for receptive field organization are described in Chapter 20. Hubel has succinctly 
put Kuffler’s achievement in perspective:
What is especially interesting to me is the unexpectedness of the results, as reflected 
in the failure of anyone before Kuffler to guess that something like center–surround 
receptive fields could exist or that the optic nerve would virtually ignore anything so 
boring as diffuse light levels.5
The principal novelty in the study of the visual system was the use of discrete, circum-
scribed spots for stimulation of selected areas of the retina, instead of diffuse uniform

illumination. A convenient way of il-
luminating particular portions of the 
retina is to anesthetize the animal and 
place it facing a screen or a computer, at 
a distance for which its eyes are properly 
refracted. When one then shines pat-
terns of light onto the screen or displays 
computer-generated images, these will 
be well focused on the retinal surface 
(see Figure 1.16).
Such procedures had been foreshad-
owed by pioneering work on the eye of a 
simple invertebrate, the horseshoe crab 
Limulus,3 and on the retina of the frog.6,7
Kuffler’s initial choice of the cat was a 
lucky one; in the rabbit, for example, 
the situation would have been more 
complicated. Rabbit ganglion cells have 
elaborate receptive fields that respond 
to such complex features as edges or to 
movement in a particular direction.8,9
Equally complex are lower vertebrates, 
such as frogs and salamanders.10 A general 
law seems to emerge: the dumber the 
animal, the smarter its retina (D. A. Baylor, 
personal communication).
Ganglion and Geniculate Cell 
Receptive Field Organization
When one records from a particular cell 
in the visual system, the first task is to find 
the location of its receptive field. Char-
acteristically, most neurons throughout 
the visual system show discharges at rest 
even in the absence of illumination. Ap-
propriate stimuli do not necessarily initi-
ate activity but may modulate the resting 
discharge, causing either an increase or a 
decrease of frequency. 
Figure 2.5 shows characteristic re-
sponses of two types of retinal ganglion 
cells to illumination in a lightly anes-
thetized cat. Ganglion cells with an “on” 
center, such as the one shown on the left, 
respond best to a small spot of light surrounded by darkness in a manner similar to the 
ganglion cells responses described in Chapter 1 (see Figure 1.16). The cell whose responses 
are shown on the right-hand side is an “off”-center cell, which responds best to a small dark 
spot surrounded by light. For the on-center receptive field in Figure 2.5, light produces the 
most vigorous response if it completely fills the center, whereas for most effective inhibition 
of firing, the light must cover the entire ring-shaped area. When the inhibitory annular 
light is turned off, the ganglion cell gives an exuberant off discharge. An off-center field has 
a converse organization, with inhibition arising in the circular center. For either cell, the 
spot-like center and its surround are antagonistic; therefore, if both center and surround 
are illuminated simultaneously, they tend to cancel each other’s contribution.
The responses of cells in the LGN are similar to those of retinal ganglion cells, as shown 
in Figure 2.6.11 As in the retina, a small spot of light, 2× or about 0.5 mm in diameter, shone 
onto a part of the receptive field is far more effective than diffuse illumination in producing

FIGURE 2.5 Receptive Fields of 
Ganglion Cells in the retinas of cats 
and monkeys are grouped into two main 
classes: on-center and off-center fields. 
On-center cells respond best to a spot 
of light shone onto the central part of the 
receptive field. Illumination (indicated by 
the red bar above records) of the sur-
rounding area with a spot or a ring of light 
reduces or suppresses the discharges and 
causes responses when the light is turned 
off. Illumination of the entire receptive field 
elicits weak discharges because center and 
surround antagonize each other’s effects, 
as with bipolar cells. Off-center cells slow 
down or stop signaling when the central 
area of their field is illuminated and acceler-
ate when the light is turned off. Light shone 
onto the surround of an off-center receptive 
field causes excitation of the neuron. (After 
Kuffler, 1953.)

tive fields of cells in the LGN resemble those of ganglion cells in the retina, consisting of on-center 
and off-center types. The responses illustrated are from an on-center cell in the cat LGN. The red 
bar above each record indicates illumination. The central and surround areas antagonize each 
other’s effects, so diffuse illumination of the entire receptive field gives only weak responses (see 
bottom record) but is less pronounced than in retinal ganglion cells (compare to Figure 2.5). (After

excitation. Furthermore, the same spot of light can have opposite effects, depending on the 
exact position of the stimulus within the receptive field. In one area, a small spot of light 
excites the cell for the duration of illumination, while simply shifting the spot by 1 mm 
or less across the retinal surface gives rise to inhibition. Again, as in the retina, two basic 
receptive field types predominate, on-center and off-center geniculate cells. The receptive 
fields of both types are roughly concentric. 
While ganglion and geniculate cells have very similar receptive field organization, 
they are not identical. For example, descending connections from layer 6 of the visual 
cortex project to geniculate neurons to modulate their firing; there is, however, no 
comparable descending input to ganglion cells. In addition there are subtle differences 
in receptive field properties, such as even greater failure of geniculate cells to respond 
to diffuse illumination. It is a general problem that the precise part played by thalamic 
structures (including the LGN) in transferring information to the cortex is still not fully 
understood12,13 (see Chapter 21). 
Sizes of Receptive Fields
Neighboring cells in the visual system collect information from very similar, but not 
quite identical, areas of the retina.14 Even a small (0.1 mm) spot of light on the retina 
covers the receptive fields of many ganglion and geniculate cells. Some are inhibited,

others excited. Throughout the visual system, neurons processing related information are 
clustered together. In sensory systems this means that the central neurons dealing with 
a particular area of the surface can communicate with each other over short distances. 
This appears to be an economical arrangement, as it minimizes the need for long lines of 
communication and simplifies formation of connections (see Chapters 3 and 20). Since 
neighboring regions of the retina make connections with neighboring geniculate cells, 
the receptive fields of adjacent neurons overlap over most of their area.15 Both the area 
centralis in the cat (the region of the cat retina with small receptive field centers) and 
the fovea in the monkey project onto the greater portion of each geniculate layer, and a 
similar distribution has been found in humans by the use of functional magnetic reso-
nance imaging (fMRI).16 There are relatively few cells devoted to the peripheral retina. 
This extensive representation of the fovea reflects the high density of foveal receptors 
necessary for high-acuity vision.
Moreover, the size of the receptive field of a ganglion, geniculate, or cortical cell 
depends on its location in the retina (or visual field). The receptive fields of cells situated 
in the central areas of the retina have much smaller centers than those at the periphery; 
receptive fields are smallest in the fovea, where the acuity of vision is highest.17 The 
central on or off region of such a midget ganglion cell’s receptive field can be supplied by 
a single cone and is accordingly only about 2.5 μm in diameter, subtending 0.5 minutes 
of arc—smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Note that receptive fields 
can be described either as dimensions on the retina or as degrees of arc subtended by 
the stimulus. In human eyes, 1 mm on the retina corresponds to about 4°. For reference, 
the image of the moon has a diameter of 1/8 mm on the human retina, corresponding 
to 0.5° or 30 minutes of arc.
There are similar gradations of receptive field size and spatial dimension in the 
somatosensory system. A higher-order sensory neuron in the brain, responding to a fine 
touch applied to the skin of the fingertip, has a much smaller receptive field than that 
of a neuron whose field is on the skin of the upper arm (see Chapter 21). To discern the 
form of an object, we use our fingertips and fovea, not the less discriminating regions 
with poorer resolution.
Classification of Ganglion and Geniculate Cells
Superimposed on the general scheme of on- or off-center receptive fields, ganglion cells 
in the monkey retina can be grouped into two main categories denoted as M and P. The 
criteria are both anatomical and physiological. The M and P terminology is based on the 
anatomical projections of these neurons to the LGN and then to the cortex18 (see Chapter 
3). P ganglion cells project to the four dorsal layers of smaller cells in the LGN (the parvocel-
lular division), whereas M ganglion cells project to the larger cells in two ventral layers (the 
magnocellular division). Chapter 3 describes how the characteristics of neurons in the M 
and P pathways are maintained at successive levels in the visual system. In brief, P ganglion 
cells have small receptive field centers, high spatial resolution, and are sensitive to color and 
Position. P cells provide information about fine detail at high contrast. M cells have larger 
receptive fields than P cells and are more sensitive to small differences in contrast and to 
Movement; they fire at higher frequencies and conduct impulses more rapidly along their 
larger-diameter axons. In the cat, which has no color vision, the classification of ganglion 
cells is different, with X, Y, and W groups.15 Groups X and Y are in some respects parallel 
to P and M in their properties, but there are major differences and the two classifications 
are not interchangeable.
What Information Do Ganglion and Geniculate Cells Convey?
The most striking feature of ganglion and geniculate cells with their concentric fields is 
that they tell a different story from that provided by primary sensory receptors. They do 
not convey information about absolute levels of illumination, because they behave in a 
similar fashion at different background levels of light. They ignore much of the informa-
tion of the photoreceptors, which work more like a photographic plate or a light meter. 
Rather, they measure differences within their receptive fields by comparing the degree

of illumination between the center and the surround. They appear to be designed to en-
code simultaneous contrast and ignore gradual changes in overall illumination. They are 
exquisitely tuned to detect such contrast as the edge of an image crossing the opposing 
regions of a receptive field. Chapters 17 and 20 describe a class of retinal ganglion cells 
that do respond to diffuse illumination but do not project to the visual cortex or play a 
part in form perception.19
Experiments made in the salamander retina by Baylor, Meister, and their colleagues 
suggest that temporal aspects of firing by ganglion cells can also contribute to spatial 
resolution.20,21 Throughout the previous discussion, the trains of impulses recorded from 
individual neurons have been treated as separate lines from which the analysis of visual 
input is made by the brain. Synchrony of firing by two cells, however, may be an additional 
variable. Analysis of the degree of synchrony can be used by higher centers to obtain 
information about light falling on the retina that cannot be deduced from looking at the 
firing of the two ganglion cells separately.

Strategies for Exploring the Cortex
In 1953, Stephen Kuffler pioneered the experimental analysis 
of the mammalian visual system by concentrating on recep-
tive field organization and the meaning of signals in the cat 
optic nerve.4 A clear, continuous thread from signaling to 
perception was subsequently provided through the beautiful 
experiments of Hubel and Wiesel and the large body of work 
they inspired. 
The procedure used by Hubel and Wiesel, the monitor-
ing of activity in single neurons, might seem an unprofitable 
way to study higher functions in which large numbers of cells 
take part. What chance do physiologists have of gaining in-
sight into complex actions within the brain when they sample 
only one or a few of the billions of neurons in the brain, a 
hopelessly small fraction of the total number? A feature that 
simplifies the situation in the visual cortex is that the major 
cell types are laid out in an apparently well-ordered manner 
as repeating units: adjacent points in the retina project to 
adjacent points on the cortical surface. Thus, the visual cortex 
is designed to bring an identical set of neural analyzers to bear 
on each tiny segment of the visual field. 
The problem faced by Hubel and Wiesel in 1958 was to 
find out how signals denoting small, bright, dark, or colored 
spots in the retina could be transmuted into signals that 
conveyed information about the shape, size, color, move-
ment, and depth of objects. Techniques that are routinely 
used now—such as optical recording, horseradish peroxi-
dase injection, or brain scanning—had not yet been thought 
of. At the outset, Hubel and Wiesel faced completely unan-
swered questions, which they tackled by assuming that visual 
centers in the cortex would perform their processing accord-
ing to principles similar to those in the retina, but at a more 
advanced level. It is worth pointing out that they started their 
work at a time when not only was nothing known about how 
neurons functioned in the visual cortex, but far worse, the 
field abounded with misleading or frankly wrong hypotheses 
derived from experiments made by shining bright flashes of 
light into the eye (see Chapter 1) or by cortical lesions. For 
example, neurons in the visual cortex were described in 1955 
as being on, off, on–off, or Type A neurons (which did not 
respond to anything at all). Pioneering work that reveals brand 
new concepts that stand the test of time often starts not from 
nothing but from a wealth of confused data.
One crucial strategy in Hubel and Wiesel’s analysis was 
the use of stimuli that mimic those occurring under natural 
conditions. For example, edges, contours, and simple pat-
terns presented to the eye revealed features of its organization 
that could never have been detected by using bright flashes 
without form. Another key to the success of Hubel and Wi-
esel’s approach lay in asking not simply what stimulus evokes 
a response in a particular neuron, but rather what is the most 
effective stimulus. Pursuit of this question through the various 
stages of the visual system has elicited many surprising and 
remarkable results. Their early papers demonstrated that the 
receptive fields of simple and complex cells in the primary vi-
sual cortex constitute initial stages of pattern recognition.

Cortical Receptive Fields
Responses of cortical neurons, like those of the retinal ganglion and geniculate cells, tend to 
occur on a background of maintained activity. A consistent observation is that discharges 
of cortical neurons are not significantly influenced by diffuse illumination of the retina. 
Almost complete insensitivity to diffuse light is a more pronounced feature of the process 
already noted in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus; it results from equally matched 
antagonistic actions between the inhibitory and excitatory regions in the receptive fields 
of cortical cells. Thus, the neuronal firing rate is altered only when certain demands about 
the position and form of the stimulus on the retina are met. The receptive fields of most 
cortical neurons have configurations that differ from those of retinal or geniculate cells, 
so spots of light often have little or no effect. In his Nobel address, Hubel described the 
experiment in which Wiesel and he first recognized this essential property: 
Our first real discovery came about as a surprise. For three or four hours, we got 
absolutely nowhere. Then gradually we began to elicit some vague and inconsistent 
responses by stimulating somewhere in the midperiphery of the retina. We were 
inserting the glass slide with its black spot into the slot of the ophthalmoscope when 
suddenly, over the audio monitor, the cell went off like a machine gun. After some 
fussing and fiddling, we found out what was happening. The response had nothing 
to do with the black dot. As the glass slide was inserted, its edge was casting onto the 
retina a faint but sharp shadow, a straight dark line on a light background. That was 
what the cell wanted, and it wanted it, moreover, in just one narrow range of orienta-
tions. This was unheard of. It is hard now to think back and realize just how free we 
were from any idea of what cortical cells might be doing in an animal’s daily life. 22
By following a progression of clues, Hubel and Wiesel worked out the appropriate light 
stimuli for various cortical cells; initially they classified the receptive fields as simple or com-
plex. Each of these categories includes a number of subgroups and important variables that 
bear on perceptual mechanisms. A major difference observed from ganglion and geniculate 
cells is that individual simple and complex cells are, for the most part, driven by both eyes. 
Responses of Simple Cells
Most simple cells are found in layers 4 and 6 and deep in layer 3 (Figure 2.7). All these lay-
ers receive direct input from the LGN (although layer 4C is the most favored destination, 
as described in Chapter 3). Receptive fields of simple cells can be mapped with stationary 
spots of light, and they exhibit several variations.23–25 One type of simple cell has a recep-

tive field that consists of an extended narrow central portion, flanked by two antagonistic 
areas. The center may be either excitatory or inhibitory. Figure 2.8 shows the receptive 
field of a simple cell in the striate cortex mapped out with spots of light that excited only 
weakly in the center (because the spots covered only a small fraction of the central on area).
The requirements of such simple cell are exacting, as illustrated in Figure 2.8C. For 
optimal activation, these cells need a bar of light that is not more than a certain width, 
that entirely fills the central area, and that is oriented at a certain angle. Illumination of the 
surrounding areas suppresses any ongoing activity or reduces the efficacy of a simultaneous 
center excitation. As predicted by mapping with spots of light, a vertically oriented bar is 
the most effective stimulus. Even small deviations from that pattern result in a diminished 
response. Various cells have receptive fields requiring a wide range of different orientations 
and positions. A new population of simple cells is therefore activated by rotating the stimulus 
or by shifting its position in the visual field. The distribution of inhibitory–excitatory flanks 
in various simple cell receptive fields may not be symmetrical or the field may consist of 
two longitudinal regions facing each other—one excitatory, the other inhibitory.
Figure 2.9 shows examples of four such receptive fields, all with a common axis of orienta-
tion but with differences in the distribution of areas within the field. For the receptive field 
in Figure 2.9A, a narrow slit of light oriented from 1 o’clock to 7 o’clock (assuming the visual 
field corresponds to a clock face with 12 o’clock high) elicits the best response. A dark bar in 
the same place but with light flanks suppresses ongoing spontaneous activity. Cells with the 
field shapes shown in Figure 2.9B and C fire optimally with a dark bar in the central area. 
For the field shown in Figure 2.9D, an edge with light on the left and darkness on the right 
produces the most effective “on” response, whereas reversing the dark and light areas is best 
for eliciting “off” discharges. In simple cells, the optimal width of the narrow light or dark 
bar is comparable to the diameters of the on- or off-center regions in the doughnut-shaped 
receptive fields of ganglion or lateral geniculate cells. Thus, cortical cells that have fields derived 
from the fovea are most excited by bars narrower than those that excite cells with fields in

retinal periphery, corresponding to the smaller receptive fields of foveal 
ganglion cells. Thus, the common properties of all simple cells are (1) 
that they respond best to a properly oriented stimulus positioned so 
as not to encroach on antagonistic zones, and (2) that stationary slits 
or spots can be used to define on and off areas. 
In addition to these features most simple cells respond to similar 
visual stimuli in either eye. Binocular fusion, which is not possible 
in the retina or the LGN, first appears in the visual cortex. Figure 
2.10 shows the responses evoked in a simple cell in the cat visual 
cortex by a horizontally oriented bar, shone onto the same region 
of either the left or the right retina.
Another constant and remarkable feature is that in spite of all 
the different proportions of inhibitory and excitatory areas, the two 
contributions match exactly and cancel each other’s effectiveness, so 
diffuse illumination of the entire receptive field produces a feeble 
response at best (see Figure 2.8). The off areas in cortical fields are not 
always able to initiate impulses in response to dark bars. Frequently 
(particularly in end inhibition and in the more elaborate fields to 
be described shortly), illumination of the off area can be detected 
only as a reduction in the discharge evoked from the on area. The 
movement of edges or bars of the appropriate orientation is a highly 
effective technique for initiating impulses. Once again, there is a 
specialization for detecting differences, but the spot-like contrast 
representation of ganglion cells has been transformed and extended 
into a line or an edge. Resolution has not been lost, but instead it 
has been incorporated into a more complex pattern. 
For depth perception, which is a magnocellular pathway function, 
there exists another binocular specialization of receptive fields in which 
an object out of the plane of focus casts images on disparate parts of 
the two retinas.23,26 Neurons with properties that fit the binocular cell’s 
ability for depth perception have been found in primary and associa-
tion visual cortex. For such cells, the best stimulus is an appropriately 
oriented bar in front of the plane of focus (for certain cells) or beyond 
it (for others). Impulses fail to be evoked by presenting the bar only 
to one eye or the other as well as to both eyes in the plane of focus. 
It is the disparity of the position on the two retinas that these cells 
require. Depth perception as such probably arises in higher cortical 
areas. For example, clusters of neurons with similar binocular disparity 
preferences are found in an area of visual association cortex known 
as V5 or middle temporal (MT; see Chapters 3 and 23).27 The depth 
perception of a trained monkey was predictably altered when such a 
cluster was electrically stimulated.
Synthesis of the Simple Receptive Field
In 1962, Hubel and Wiesel provided a tentative hypothesis to explain 
the origin of cortical receptive fields.24 Their scheme had the advantage 
of using known mechanisms to explain how a nerve cell can respond 
so selectively to a visual pattern—such as the oriented lines that excite 
simple cells. They suggested that in the cortex, simple cell receptive fields behave as if they are 
built from large numbers of geniculate fields.24 This is illustrated in Figure 2.11, in which the 
fields of geniculate neurons connected to a cortical cell are lined up in such a way that a prop-
erly oriented bar of light, traversing their centers, would excite them all strongly. If the bar were 
widened or displaced slightly to either side, it would fall on the inhibitory surround of each 
cell and reduce or stop the excitatory output. Convergence of these geniculate neurons could 
produce a cortical cell whose optimal stimulus would be just such an oriented bar of light.
Connections such as these were postulated by Hubel and Wiesel as the simplest that 
could account for orientation selectivity. That is, the pattern of geniculate innervation

in the two eyes reinforces off discharges (lower three records). In 
contrast, cells used for depth perception have receptive fields in 
both eyes but in disparate regions of the visual field. Such cells re-
quire that the bar be placed farther from or closer to the eye than 
the plane of focus. (After Hubel and Wiesel, 1959.)

itself determines the response characteristics of cortical neurons. This would constitute a 
feed forward mechanism. An alternative hypothesis was that intracortical connections and 
lateral inhibition were responsible for the sharpness of receptive field orientation, stemming 
from the suppression of excitability by laterally placed or inappropriately oriented stimuli 
and the insensitivity to contrast. 
Tests to distinguish between the various schemes could not be made directly by Hubel 
and Wiesel, since they made all their recordings with extracellular electrodes. Intracellular 
recordings are much more difficult to make and to maintain without damaging the cell. 
But they have an advantage: unlike extracellular recordings, an intracellular electrode allows 
one to assess the potency as well as the source of excitatory and inhibitory synapses arriving 
at a cell from various inputs. Thus, fibers coming to a neuron from the lateral geniculate 
nucleus or from the cortex can be stimulated selectively and their effects observed directly.
Ferster and his colleagues achieved a major advance toward a more detailed analysis 
of how a receptive field is built up from its inputs. They succeeded in recording from 
individual simple and complex cells with intracellular microelectrodes.28–30 Recordings 
made from a simple cell that responds to a vertically oriented bar with high specificity are 
shown in Figure 2.12. In such records, one can observe the synaptic potentials activated by 
visual stimuli. They are produced by transmitter release from geniculate axons as well as 
from intracortical connections. These experiments have shown that direct geniculocorti-
cal excitatory potentials sum to greater amplitudes at preferred orientations, as would be 
expected if the arrangement illustrated in Figure 2.11 existed. 
Figure 2.13 shows the effect of local cooling of the cortex.31 The procedure abolishes 
all polysynaptic activity arising from intracortical connections, while leaving the geniculate

Hypothesis devised by Hubel and Wiesel to explain the

input intact so that only direct monosynaptic geniculate input persists 
(albeit slowed and reduced in amplitude). As shown in Figure 2.13B the 
orientation tuning remains even though the late (intracortical) response 
peak is absent. Although the pattern of geniculate inputs is sufficient for 
orientation tuning of simple cells in visual cortex, additional refinement 
is provided by both inhibitory and excitatory intracortical connections. 
Intracellular recordings from simple cells show that illumination of sur-
rounding off areas produces inhibitory synaptic potentials. These can 
serve to sharpen orientation selectivity and to maintain tuning as visual 
contrast varies but are not, on their own, responsible for the formation 
of on and off areas. 
Intracellular recordings30 and cross correlations32–34 have been made 
while the receptive field of a simple cell is mapped by small spots. These 
analyses make it possible to predict how the receptive field organization of a simple cell 
enables it to respond to a particular orientation and direction of movement (see below). 
Responses of Complex Cells
In recordings made from individual neurons in the visual cortex, one finds, in addition 
to simple cells, other neurons, called complex cells, which behave quite differently. These 
complex cells, which are abundant in layers 2, 3, and 5, have two important properties in 
common with simple cells: (1) illumination of the entire field is ineffective, and (2) they 
require specific field axis orientation of a dark–light boundary. The responses of a complex 
cell are shown in Figure 2.14. Complex cells, like simple cells, have comparable receptive 
fields in corresponding regions of both retinas (see Figure 2.10). The demand, however, 
for precise positioning of the stimulus, observed in simple cells, is relaxed in complex 
cells. In addition, there are no longer distinct on and off areas that can be mapped with

the boundary of the receptive field, most complex cells will respond, as in 
the examples illustrated in Figure 2.14. In this cell, the vertical edge causes 
nearly equivalent responses at any of four locations. Other orientations 
are ineffective. Extending the visual stimulus beyond the boundary of 
the field has no effect. The meaning of the signals arising from complex 
cells, therefore, differs significantly from that of simple cells. The simple 
cell localizes an oriented bar of light to a particular position within the 
receptive field, whereas the signals of a complex cell provide information 
about orientation without strict reference to position.
RESPONSES TO MOVING STIMULI Many simple and complex cells 
respond best to moving slits or bars of fixed width and precise orienta-
tion. Some cells respond only when the movement is in one direction. An 
example is shown in Figure 2.15. Downward movement of the bar evokes 
a far brisker response than upward movement; as the lower traces show, 
the orientation of the bar remains critical. Directional sensitivity is a feature commonly 
found in complex cells. Still more demanding complex cells can be found than the ones 
previously described, particularly in other cortical areas (see Chapters 3 and 23). Once 
again, intracellular recordings enable one to explain how such movement sensitivity is 
achieved in cortical neurons as the result of synaptic potentials evoked by visual stimuli.30
CORTICAL NEURONS THAT RESPOND TO LINES THAT STOP Another interesting 
feature of certain simple and complex cells is that they require bars or edges that do not 
extend beyond a fixed length.25,35 Once again, the orientation of the stimulus and, often, the 
direction of movement are critical. Figure 2.16 shows recordings from a cell that responded 
best to an obliquely oriented bar of light. Stretching the bar beyond an optimal length re-
duced its effectiveness as a stimulus. It is as though there are additional off areas that exist 
on either side of the fields shown in dashed lines in Figure 2.16. Light with the appropriate 
pattern falling in these areas tends to suppress firing. However, diffuse illumination outside 
the field does not diminish the response. It is therefore not a conventional off area, as such. 
End inhibition or end stopping are the names given to this property.

a characteristic known as end stopping.

Hence, for a complex cell of this sort the best stimulus is an appropriately oriented bar 
or edge, of a defined length, that stops at a particular place. The cell requires a discontinuity 
in the visual pattern if it is to respond. It is worth emphasizing what a major achievement 
it was for Hubel and Wiesel to show unequivocally that a particular neuron requires this
particular stimulus for it to fire.
The properties of the neurons that require a line to stop can provide a cue to a clinical 
observation in humans, known as the completion phenomenon, which occurs when small 
retinal or cortical lesions cause blind areas or scotomas. In this condition, forms or shapes 
projected onto the retina appear to contain an empty region in the visual field corresponding 
to the site of the lesion. Yet, if subjects look at striped wallpaper (Figure 2.17), a straight 
line pattern, or a zebra, they see the pattern continue through the blind area. 
Synthesis of the Complex Receptive Field
In the same way that the receptive field of a simple cortical cell can be built up by the con-
vergence of geniculate afferents, so too can the receptive field of a complex cortical cell be 
synthesized by combining those of simple cells.24,36 Figure 2.18 presents a hypothetical com-
plex cell that is excited by a vertical edge stimulus that falls anywhere within the area of the 
receptive field. This is so because wherever the edge falls, one of the simple fields is traversed

restricted to the left field would excite. E = excitation; I = inhibition.

at its vertical inhibitory–excitatory boundary. The other simple fields do not respond because 
both of their components are either illuminated or darkened uniformly. Diffuse illumination 
of the entire field covers all component fields equally and therefore none fires.
One can postulate that only one or a few of the simple cells need to fire at any one posi-
tion of the stimulus to evoke a near maximal response in a complex cell. Consistent with this 
hypothesis, intracellular recording from complex cells reveals few monosynaptic contacts 
from the lateral geniculate nucleus. Instead, there is a preponderance of long-latency inputs, 
presumably arising from cortical simple cells.37 The tentative scheme for an end-stopped 
complex cell is illustrated in Figure 2.18B. There, two complex cells with opposing synaptic 
effects combine to produce the end-stopped complex cell that could detect a corner.
Receptive Fields: Units for Form Perception
Together these results lend support to the idea of hierarchical organization whereby increasing 
complexity in receptive field organization is produced by the orderly convergence of appro-
priate inputs. This feature does not mean that each receptive field of succeeding complexity 
is generated solely by combining inputs derived from the immediately preceding level. For 
instance, complex cells can receive inputs from LGN cells.38 Moreover, numerous horizontal 
connections between visual neurons are prevalent throughout the cortex.39 As mentioned pre-
viously, cortical input serves to sharpen the orientation tuning of simple cells. Nonetheless, the 
original working hypothesis proposed by Hubel and Wiesel in 1962 continues to provide a clear, 
elegant, and reasonable conceptual framework upon which to design new experimental tests.
Table 2.1 summarizes some of the key characteristics of receptive fields at successive levels 
of the visual system. Each eye conveys to the brain information collected from regions of 
various sizes on the retinal surface. The emphasis is not on diffuse illumination or the absolute 
amount of energy absorbed by photoreceptors. Rather the visual system extracts informa-
tion about contrast by comparing the level of activity in cells with adjoining receptive fields. 
At each higher level, such neural computations define ever more elaborate spatial features.
This process can be appreciated by considering the types of signals generated by a square 
patch of light as shown in Figure 2.19. On-center retinal ganglion cells within the square 
will increase their discharge (at least initially), while off-center cells are suppressed. The

best-stimulated ganglion cells, however, are those subjected to the maximum contrast—that 
is, those having centers lying immediately adjacent to the boundary between the light and 
dark areas and consequently, having less activation of their inhibitory regions. Neurons 
in the LGN behave similarly. Cortical cells having receptive fields lying either completely 
within the square or outside it send no signals because diffuse illumination is not an ef-
fective stimulus. Only those simple cells with receptive fields oriented to coincide with the 
horizontal or vertical boundaries of the square will be stimulated. 
Similar considerations apply to the stimulation of complex cells, which also require 
properly oriented bars or edges. End-inhibited simple or complex cells detect the corner of 
the square or a line that stops. There is an important difference between the two, however, 
which is related to the fact that the eyes continually make small saccadic eye movements 
(see Chapter 24). These are not perceived as motion but are essential for preventing photo-
receptor adaptation as the eyes fixate. Each microsaccade causes a new population of simple 
cells with exactly the same orientation but with slightly different receptive field location to 
be thrown into action. For those complex cells that see the square, however, a boundary of 
appropriate orientation can be anywhere within the field. Thus, many of the same complex 
cells will continue to fire during eye movements, as long as the displacement is small and 
the pattern does not pass outside the receptive field of the cell.
If the preceding considerations are valid, the surprising conclusion is that the primary 
visual cortex receives little information about the absolute level of uniform illumination 
within the square. Signals arrive only from the cells with receptive fields situated close to 
the border. This hypothesis is supported by an easily replicated psychophysical experiment. 
A square that appears light when surrounded by a black border can be made to appear 
dark merely by increasing the brightness of the surround. In other words, we perceive the 
difference or contrast at the boundary, and it is by that standard that the brightness in the 
uniformly illuminated central area is judged. 
This is not to say that general luminance is entirely ignored by the nervous system. For 
example, we do know if a room is dark or light and that the diameter of the eye’s pupil varies 
with ambient light intensity. Such responses depend on a particular group of ganglion cells 
that send their output to a region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which 
regulates the day–night circadian rhythm (see Chapters 17 and 20).

Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.
The work of Hubel and Wiesel and others has made clear that the first general step in 
visual analysis is to construct representations of lines or edges from the center–surround, 
spot-like receptive fields of the retina. In V1, the visual system begins to derive form from 
the retinal map. Finding these connections has given us our first glimpse into how the brain 
computes. But these first steps in the detection of a line or even a corner remain a long way 
from complete visual recognition during which shape, color, size, and motion are all combined, 
so that we can recognize a car, a cow, or the face of a friend. In Chapter 3, we describe how 
geniculate and cortical neurons are arranged spatially, in a highly orderly manner.
It is appropriate to close this chapter with a quotation from Sherrington, written long 
before receptive fields were mapped for single cells. Sherrington’s somewhat opaque style 
(unlike that of Helmholtz) often makes it difficult to read his profoundly original papers and 
books. Yet the following paragraph reveals his poetic insight into the physiology of vision: 
The chief wonder of all we have not touched on yet. Wonder of wonders, though 
familiar even to boredom. So much with us that we forget it all the time. The eye 
sends, as we saw, into the cell-and-fibre forest of the brain throughout the waking 
day continual rhythmic streams of tiny, individual evanescent, electrical potentials. 
This throbbing streaming crowd of electrified shifting points in the spongework of 
the brain bears no obvious semblance in space-pattern, and even in temporal relation 
resembles but a little remotely the tiny two-dimensional upside-down picture of the 
outside world which the eye-ball paints on the beginnings of its nerve-fibres to elec-
trical storm. And the electrical storm so set up is one which affects a whole popula-
tion of brain-cells. Electrical charges having in themselves not the faintest elements 
of the visual—having, for instance, nothing of “distance,” “right-side-upness,” no 
“vertical,” nor “horizontal,” nor “color,” nor “brightness,” nor “shadow,” nor “round-
ness,” nor “squareness,” nor “contour,” nor “transparency,” nor “opacity,” nor “near,” 
nor “far,” nor visual anything—yet conjure up all these. A shower of little electri-
cal leaks conjures up for me, when I look, the landscape; the castle on the height, or 
when I look at him, my friend’s face and how distant he is from me they tell me. Tak-
ing their word for it, I go forward and my other senses confirm that he is there. 40

FIGURE 2.19 Responses of Neurons to a Pattern. When a 
square patch of light is presented to the retina, signals arise pre-
dominately from ganglion cells and lateral geniculate cells whose 
receptive fields lie close to the border of the square—and not from 
those subjected to uniform light or darkness. The cell whose fields 
are situated exactly at the four corners of the square will fire best of 
all. Simple and complex cells having receptive fields with the correct 
position (i.e., situated along the border or at a corner) and the cor-
rect orientation preference will also fire, while those not on the border 
or with an inappropriate orientation will remain silent. Activity level is 
indicated by the number of radiating lines around each field.

SUMMARY
 
■
The receptive field of a neuron in the visual system 
is the area of the retina or visual field that, upon 
illumination, enhances or inhibits signaling. 
 
■
An important strategy for analyzing the visual system is 
to define the optimal light stimulus for each neuron.
 
■
Ganglion cells in the retina and cells in the lateral 
geniculate nucleus respond best to contrast in the form 
of small spots of light surrounded by darkness or dark 
spots surrounded by light.
 
■
Ganglion cells and lateral geniculate nucleus cells 
respond poorly to diffuse light.
 
■
Simple cells in striate cortex, V1, respond to oriented 
light or dark bars. Their receptive fields can be mapped 
with spots of light, as though composed of adjoining 
lateral geniculate center–surround receptive fields.
 
■
Complex cells in striate cortex also respond to oriented 
bars or edges. However, their receptive fields cannot 
be mapped with spots of light. They result from the 
convergence of multiple simple cells with adjoining 
receptive areas.
 
■
Simple and complex cells respond to movement of bars 
or edges.
 
■
End inhibition results when an additional suppressive 
zone specifies the optimal length for a simple or 
complex cell. These cells provide information about 
where a line ends or about the position of a corner.


■ CHAPTER 3
Functional Architecture 
of the Visual Cortex
V
ertically arranged clusters of neurons with similar properties are organized systematically 
through the thickness of the visual cortex. Each cluster receives its input from a small 
region of the visual field that is mapped onto the cortex. Maps on their own, however, do 
not provide insights into the functional architecture of the visual cortex; for that, one needs to 
know how the neurons that respond to specific visual stimuli are arranged in three dimensions. 
Detailed information about structure turns out to be essential for an understanding of how visual 
information is processed in the brain. The six layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) have specific 
organizational properties: incoming fibers from the lateral geniculate nucleus for the most part 
end in layer 4. Neurons in upper (2, 3) and deeper layers (5, 6) receive their inputs from the cortex 
and project to other layers or areas. Neurons that are preferentially driven by the right or the left 
eye are grouped in ocular dominance columns. Neurons whose line or edge preferences are at 
similar angles constitute orientation columns. The ocular dominance and orientation columns 
were first discovered by recording electrical activity, cell after cell, as electrodes traversed the 
cortical thickness. Ocular dominance and orientation columns are revealed directly in the living 
animal by optical techniques that display activated regions in the cortex. The word “column” is still 
used even though the arrangement consists of cortical slabs (for ocular dominance) or pinwheels 
(for orientation), rather than narrow columns. Each column of cortical cells functions as a module, 
operating on input from one location in visual space and forwarding the processed information to 
other areas. The location of the receptive fields of neurons in a column is the same throughout the 
depth of the cortex. 
Neurons from the lateral geniculate nucleus with different properties supply distinct regions of 
the visual cortex. Thus, magnocellular axons (M, movement, contrast, depth) end more superficially 
in layer 4 than do parvocellular axons (P, position, color). On the other hand, koniocellular genicu-
late axons (K, short wavelength) project differentially to clusters outside layer 4, called blobs. These 
structures were first revealed by stains for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase. Although mixing of M, 
P, and K streams occurs throughout the visual pathways, features such as color and motion are 
analyzed separately. This phenomenon is illustrated not only by physiological recordings but also by 
the fact that a lesion in a discrete region of the brain can result in selective loss of a feature, such as 
color, rather than in an overall reduction in quality of visual images. 

44 Chapter 3
In Chapter 2, we followed the flow of information from the retina to the primary visual 
cortex and described the effects of visual stimuli on successively higher-order cortical cells. 
This approach provided an understanding of the cellular mechanisms for the initial analysis 
of form and motion at each point in the visual field. Our task now is to describe how neurons 
are organized spatially to subserve their functions in the visual pathways (Figure 3.1). In 
this chapter, we show how inputs from the two eyes arrive at the visual cortex and how cells 
are grouped according to their physiological functions. We next examine the evidence that 
motion and color are analyzed in parallel channels through the cortex. Finally, we introduce 
examples of higher levels of processing in visual areas beyond the primary visual cortex, a 
topic that is dealt with in detail in Chapter 23. 
From Chapters 1 and 2, it is apparent that knowledge of structure is not just a dry, 
didactic exercise that can be skipped over. Such knowledge turns out to be essential if one is 
to understand how different aspects of a scene (for example, form, color, depth and motion) 
are encoded in the cortex. A remarkable feature of the visual structure to be described in this 
chapter is that completely new and unexpected findings about how the brain is structured 
anatomically—came first from a series of physiological recordings made from single neurons, 
one at a time. Hubel and Wiesel have recalled that: “…to attack such a three-dimensional 
problem with a one-dimensional weapon is a dismaying exercise in tedium, like trying to 
cut the back lawn with a pair of nail scissors.”1 
It will be shown that in visual area 1 (V1) there is point-to-point representation 
of the retina: within this retinotopic map, inputs from the two eyes come together and 
are sorted into ocular dominance columns. These columns consist of vertically stacked 
groups of neurons that respond better either to the left eye or right eye. In addition, there 
are other major functional groupings, consisting of orientation columns of cells (all of 
which respond to a specific line orientation, such as vertical, oblique, or horizontal) and 
still other clusters of cells devoted to colors. Unusual in this chapter, as in Chapter 2, is 
the continuous reference to older experiments. The reason is that the work by Hubel and 
Wiesel represents a solid foundation, which has been confirmed, modified, and extended 
by others but not superseded. 
Retinotopic Maps
Each area of cortex contains its own representation of the visual field, projected in an 
orderly, retinotopic manner.2 Maps of the visual fields in adjacent areas are orientated in 
mirror fashion across cortical gyri (folds), a feature that facilitates communication.3 Before 
the era of single-cell analysis, projection maps were made by shining light onto parts of the 
retina and recording with gross electrodes.4 These maps, and those made by brain-imaging 
techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic reso-

nance imaging (fMRI), show that much more cortical area is devoted to representation of 
the fovea than to representation of the rest of the retina. This comes as no surprise, since 
form vision is served principally by the higher densities of photoreceptors in foveal and 
parafoveal areas and is analogous to the enlarged areas devoted to the hand and face in the 
primary somatosensory cortex (see Chapter 21). The retinal fovea is mapped onto the oc-
cipital pole of the cerebral cortex, while the map of the retinal periphery extends anteriorly, 
along the medial surface of the occipital lobe (Figure 3.2).5 Because of image reversal by 
the eye, the upper visual field appears on the lower retina and is projected to V1 below the 
calcarine fissure; accordingly, lower visual fields map above the calcarine fissure.
From Lateral Geniculate Nucleus to Visual Cortex
Segregation of Retinal Inputs to the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus 
Neurons in the six principal layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are grouped ac-
cording to structure and function. In primates, including humans (as mentioned in Chapter 
2), geniculate layers 6, 4, and 1 are supplied by the contralateral eye, while layers 5, 3, and 
2 are supplied by the ipsilateral eye.6 The complete segregation of endings from each eye 
into separate cell layers has been shown by electrical recording and a variety of anatomical 
techniques.7,8 Particularly striking is the arborization of a single optic nerve fiber, shown 
in Figure 3.3, that had been injected with the enzyme horseradish peroxidase. The termi-
nals are all confined to the layers supplied by that eye, with no spillover across the border. 
Another major feature of the LGN is segregation according to the size of neurons, which 
in turn bears on their function. As described in Chapter 2, cells in the deep layers 1 and 2 of 
the lateral geniculate nucleus are larger than those in layers 3, 4, 5, and 6, and this gave rise 
to the terms magnocellular (M, large cells with large receptive fields) and parvocellular (P, 
small cells with small receptive fields; see Figure 3.3). In Chapter 2, it was shown that the 
same classification holds for ganglion cells in the retina. M neurons respond preferentially to 
movement, depth, and contrast, while P neurons respond to position and color. Between each 
of the M and P layers lies a zone of small cells: the interlaminar, or koniocellular (K), layers. 
K cells are distinct from M and P cells and provide the visual cortex with a third channel, 
which is concerned primarily with information about short-wavelength color (blue light).9,10
Cytoarchitecture of the Visual Cortex
Visual information passes to the cortex from the LGN through the optic radiation. In the 
monkey, the optic radiation ends mainly (but not exclusively11) in V1 (also called striate 
cortex or area 17, terms based on anatomical criteria developed at the beginning of the 
twentieth century). V1 lies posteriorly in the occipital lobe (see Figure 3.2) and can be recog-
nized in cross section by its characteristic appearance. In sections of V1, incoming bundles 
of fibers form a clear stripe that can be seen by the naked eye (hence the name “striate”). 
The organization of geniculate projections to the striate cortex is illustrated in Figure 3.5. 
In histological sections of the cortex, neurons can be classified according to their 
shapes. The two principal groups of neurons are known as stellate cells and pyramidal cells.

into a central zone (the fovea) and eight 
hemiquadrants. The left visual field maps 
onto the right primary visual cortex. (B) In 
humans, the primary visual cortex (area

surface of the occipital lobe. The foveal 
region is situated in the farthest poste-
rior portion, with the peripheral zones 
mapping anteriorly. The fovea claims a 
disproportionate share of the primary 
visual cortex.

Examples of these cells are shown in Figure 3.4B.12 The axon of the pyramidal cell is long, 
descends into white matter, and leaves the cortex; the stellate cell axon tends to terminate 
locally. The two groups of cells exhibit other variations that bear on their functional proper-
ties, such as the presence or absence of spines on the dendrites. There are other fancifully 
named cortical neurons (double bouquet cells, chandelier cells, basket cells, and crescent 
cells) as well as neuroglial cells. Characteristically, processes of cells for the most part run 
vertically through the thickness of the cortex (at right angles to the surface, also referred 
to as “radially”). Connections between primary and higher-order visual cortices are made 
by axons that run in bundles through the white matter underlying the cellular layers.13

Functional Architecture of the Visual Cortex 47
Other regions of cortex (V2–V5) are also concerned with vision. Their exact bound-
aries cannot be defined by simple inspection of the brain, but have been delineated by a 
number of techniques. These include imaging, experimental lesions, psychophysics, and 
physiology.14–18 It will be shown that different visual areas communicate with one another 
in both directions and perform different types of analysis relating to form, color, depth, 
and movement (see Chapter 23).
Inputs, Outputs, and Layering of Cortex
Six layers of nerve cells are evident within the gray matter of V1, as in other regions of the 
brain (see Figure 3.4). The inputs are shown in the left-hand side of Figure 3.5. Incoming 
geniculate fibers for the most part end in layer 4, with some contacts also made in layer 6 
(see below).19 Superficial layers of the cortex receive inputs from the pulvinar a region of 
the thalamus. Numerous cortical cells, especially those in layer 2 and the upper portions 
of layers 3 and 5, receive inputs from neurons within the cortex. 
 The outputs from cortical layers 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 are shown in the right-hand side 
of Figure 3.5. A single cell that sends efferent signals out of the cortex can also mediate

cells in layers 5 and 6 send axons to the

niculate nucleus. Koniocellular pathways 
end in superficial layers and in structures

intracortical connections from one layer to another. For example, the axons of cells in layer 
6, in addition to supplying the geniculate, can end in one of several other cortical layers, 
depending on the cell type.20
From this anatomy a general pattern emerges: information from the retina is trans-
mitted to cortical cells (mainly in layer 4) by geniculate axons, handed on from neuron to 
neuron through the thickness of the cortex, and then sent out to other regions of the brain 
by fibers looping out through white matter. The radial, or vertical, organization of cortex 
suggests that columns of neurons serve as computational units, processing some feature of 
the visual scene and passing it on to other cortical regions. Lateral connections also exist, 
(i.e., parallel to the surface of the cortex); they enable neurons in neighboring areas to 
communicate with one another (see below). In addition, geniculate inputs project directly 
to areas of cortex beyond V1, for example to visual area 5 (see below), which is concerned 
with movement and depth perception.11
Ocular Dominance Columns
Whether we look at an object with one or both eyes, we see only one image, even though 
the positions of the object’s projection are slightly different on the two retinas. Interestingly, 
well over 100 years ago Johannes Müller suggested that individual nerve fibers from the 
two eyes might fuse or become connected to the same cells in the brain. Thereby, he almost 
exactly anticipated Hubel and Wiesel’s results (see Figure 2.9).1,21
Hubel and Wiesel’s early experiments showed cortical cells 
with similar properties to be aggregated together in a vertical 
array.1 In any one penetration through the cortex, as the electrode 
moved from the surface through layer after layer to white matter, 
all cells were found to share certain common properties. Thus, 
as the electrode moved deeper and deeper through the cortex 
along the length of a column, all the neurons encountered had 
the same receptive field position and the same eye preference. For 
example, in one penetration, every cell would respond better to 
the visual stimuli, say, in the left eye.
Figure 3.6 summarizes the results of many physiological 
recordings and shows the variation in eye preference (or ocular 
dominance) of neurons in the monkey striate cortex. The cells 
(total of 1116) are subdivided into seven groups. In groups 2, 3, 
5, and 6, the effect of one eye is stronger than that of the other, 
while the cells in the middle group 4 are equally influenced. It 
is clear from the histogram that the majority of cells respond 
preferentially to one of the two eyes. Cells in groups 1 and 7, 
however, are driven exclusively by either the left or the right 
eye. These monocularly driven cells occur mainly in layer 4, the 
principal receiving station for geniculate inputs. Above and below 
layer 4, simple, complex, and end-stopped cortical neurons (see 
Chapter 2) are driven by both eyes.
“Ocular dominance columns” was the term that Hubel and 
Wiesel used to describe the vertical segregation of neurons through 
the thickness of V1 according to eye preference. Their terminol-
ogy followed the original concept of cortical columns, which 
was introduced by Mountcastle for somatosensory cortex.22–24
Anatomical studies on cats and monkeys confirmed that the 
cells in one layer of the LGN project to aggregates of target cells 
in layer 4 that are separate from those supplied by the other eye. 
The aggregates appear as alternating stripes or bands of cortical 
cells, each supplied exclusively by one eye. As mentioned, cells are 
driven by both eyes in the deeper and more superficial cortical 
layers, although one eye usually dominates.
One of the first techniques for demonstrating columns histo-
logically was to destroy a small group of cells in one layer of the

lateral geniculate nucleus and examine the cortex later for degenerating terminals. These 
terminals appeared in layer 4 in a characteristic pattern of alternating, well-demarcated 
regions7 that corresponded to areas driven by the eye supplying the lesioned layer of the LGN.
Later, the ocular dominance pattern over the entire visual cortex was clearly demon-
strated by injecting radioactive amino acids, such as leucine or proline, into one eye. The 
amino acid was taken up by ganglion cells in the retina and incorporated into protein. In 
time, the labeled protein was transported from ganglion cells along the optic nerve fibers 
to their terminals within the lateral geniculate nucleus. An extraordinary feature was that 
the label was then transferred to the geniculate cells and on to the endings of their axons 
in the cortex, revealing the striking ocular dominance pattern shown in Figure 3.7.25–27 It 
is not yet known whether or how transsynaptic transport of protein is used physiologically.

At the cellular level, a similar pattern has been revealed in layer 4 by injection of 
horseradish peroxidase into individual axons of lateral geniculate neurons as they approach 
the cortex.8 The axon, shown in Figure 3.7C, is that of an off-center geniculate fiber (see 
Chapter 2) that gave transient responses to dark, moving spots. It ends in two distinct 
clusters of processes in layer 4. The processes are separated by a blank area corresponding 
in size to the territory supplied by the other eye. Such morphological studies have borne 
out and added depth to the original description of ocular dominance columns presented 
by Hubel and Wiesel in 1962.
Demonstration of Ocular Dominance Columns by Imaging
Ocular dominance columns in the visual cortex can be visualized directly in intact ani-
mals. Activity in a large area of cortex is monitored while visual stimuli are presented to 
the animal. The technique uses activity-dependent optical signals that arise from changes 
in tissue reflectivity or changes in fluorescence of extrinsically applied dyes.28–30  Figure 3.8 
shows ocular dominance columns detected by this kind of experiment, in which a visual 
stimulus was applied repeatedly to only one eye. The striped pattern is like that obtained 
after injection of radioactive amino acids into one eye (see Figure 3.7). The projection of 
these surface stripes through the depth of cortex confirms the concept of ocular domi-
nance “slabs” (rather than columns) subdividing the retinotopic map. The representation 
of information from both eyes, regarding a stimulus at one position in the visual field, is 
integrated by neighboring cells in the visual cortex (see Figure 3.7B). The maps shown in 
Figures 3.8 and 3.10 were observed without the use of dyes; they are a reflection of altered 
blood flow and oxygenation in the active area. By use of a staining technique for the enzyme 
cytochrome oxidase (to be described below), Horton and his colleagues have mapped the 
complete arrangement of ocular dominance columns in post mortem human visual cortex.31
Orientation Columns
What other functional groupings occur among cells of V1? In Chapter 2, we described the 
orientation preferences of simple and complex cells, so we might ask whether this feature 
is systematically mapped across the cortex. A sample experiment is shown in Figure 3.9 in 
which a microelectrode is inserted perpendicular to the surface of the cortex in area V1 of 
the cat. 22 Each bar indicates the location of one cell and its preferred receptive field orien-
tation in the progression through the cortical depth. Small lesions are made at significant 
points along the electrode track by passing current through the electrode. From these lesions 
and an end point (indicated by the circle at the end of each electrode track), the position of 
each recorded cell is reconstructed. In the left-hand track, the first 38 cells were optimally

driven by bars or edges at about 90° to the vertical, at one position in the visual field. After 
penetrating about 0.6 mm, the axis of the receptive field orientation changed to about 45°. 
In a second track (to the right) more tangential to the cortical surface than the first track, 
successive cells have slightly different receptive field positions and field axis orientations. 
With this oblique penetration, the field axes change in a regular manner, as though mov-
ing through a series of columns with different axis orientations. The orientation columns 
receive their input from cells with largely overlapping receptive fields on the retinal surface.
Information about how the orientation columns are spatially arranged in the visual cortex 
of monkeys and cats was first obtained by making tangential electrode penetrations through 
the cortex (see Figure 3.9).1,23,32  Each 50 μm advance of the electrode horizontally along the 
cortex was accompanied by a change in field axis orientation of about 10°, sometimes in a 
regular sequence through 180°. The field axis orientation columns were narrower than those 
for ocular dominance—20 to 50 μm wide, compared with 250 to 500 μm.
After the initial anatomical demonstration of orientation columns based on the uptake 
of 2-deoxyglucose by active cells,33 the organization was studied in detail by optical imag-
ing techniques in living animals.28,34–36 An example is the experiment shown in Figure 
3.10. The presentation of visual stimuli in a variety of orientations produced activity in 
different cortical areas. The response to each orientation is represented by a different color 
(thus, yellow represents cells that prefer a horizontally oriented visual stimulus, while 
blue represents vertical). What is striking is the arrangement of the orientation columns 
with respect to one another. At first, the organization appears disorderly. However, careful

have the same axis orientation, indicated by the angle of the bar to the elec-
trode track. The penetration to the right is more oblique; consequently, the 
track crosses several columns and the axis orientations change frequently. 
The position of each cell is determined by making lesions repeatedly and at 
the end of the penetration (circle), and reconstructing the electrode track in 
serial sections of the brain. Such experiments have established that cat and 
monkey cells with similar axis orientation are stacked in columns running at 
right angles to the cortical surface. (After Hubel and Wiesel, 1962.)

centers at which all orientation contours come together in a pinwheel, 
as shown in (B) Note that each orientation is represented only once 
and that the sequence is beautifully precise. Such pinwheel centers 
occur at regular distances from each other. The bars on the right 
show eight different orientations for the visual stimuli, represented by

inspection reveals the presence of pinwheel* centers; that is, focal points at which all the 
orientations come together. From there, the cells responsive to a particular orientation 
radiate in an extraordinarily regular manner. Some pinwheels are systematically organized 
with clockwise, others with counterclockwise, progression. Thus, orientation is represented 
in a radial rather than a linear fashion. Each orientation appears only once in the cycle.37
Cell Groupings for Color
In their initial experiments, Hubel and Wiesel worked with cats, which do not have color 
vision. It was therefore not to be expected that color-coded cells would be found in the 
visual cortex. However, even in monkeys, which do see color, color-coded cells were missed 
in early experiments on the visual cortex. In Chapter 20, it will be shown that in monkey 
and human retinas red, green, and blue cones preferentially absorb light in long-, medium-, 
and short-wavelength ranges. The inputs from those cones converge onto color-coded 
horizontal cells, ganglion cells, and lateral geniculate cells of the parvocellular division. The 
color-sensitive parvo cells were at first missed in monkey cortex because they are separately 
aggregated in small clusters, known as patches or “blobs,” a name that has persisted in the 
literature. Blobs are roughly circular patches of cells (Figure 3.11) mainly in layers 2 and 
3 but also in 5 and 6. They were first detected by Wong–Riley, who used stains to visual-
ize cytochrome oxidase, an enzyme associated with areas of high metabolic activity.38 Her 
experiments, devoted to a completely different problem, ended up revealing fundamen-
tal aspects of cortical structure. In primates, the patches of cytochrome oxidase stain are 
precisely arranged in parallel rows about 0.5 mm apart. Their positions correspond to the 
centers of ocular dominance columns.39,40 
Electrical recordings show that many cells within the blobs are color-sensitive and 
have concentric fields with on and off regions.41 These observations led to the suggestion 
that the cytochrome oxidase blobs represent a separate pathway for color, intermingled 
with the orientation and ocular dominance columns.8,10,42,43 The blobs also receive inputs 
from M sublayers of layer 4C and contain neurons with M-like response properties.44

The blob–interblob regions provide an as yet incompletely understood sorting and 
recombination of the M, P, and K pathways. Important aspects of color vision, includ-
ing photoreceptor pigments, retinal connections, and color constancy, are dealt with in 
Chapter 20. 
Connections of Magnocellular and Parvocellular Pathways between 
V1 and Visual Area 2 (V2)
Visual area 2 (V2, also known as area 18) immediately surrounds V1, receives inputs from 
it and feeds back onto it, as shown in Figure 3.12. In V2, the striate appearance is lost, large 
cells are found superficially, and coarse, obliquely running myelinated fibers are seen in the 
deeper layers. The technique of staining for cytochrome oxidase has made it possible to 
study columnar organization and to trace connections of magnocellular and parvocellular 
systems from one visual area to another. It has also been important for displaying features 
of cortical architecture in post mortem human brains. The pattern of connections from V1 
to V2 is shown in Figure 3.12 in which it is clear that staining V2 with cytochrome oxidase 
produces a pattern different from that seen in V1.40 The stain in V2 appears as a series of 
thick and thin stripes, alternating with paler areas having less enzyme activity. These paral-
lel stripes run at right angles to the border between V1 and V2. After horseradish peroxi-
dase is injected into blobs (parvo) of V1, it is taken up by axon terminals and transported 
retrogradely, revealing that nerve cells providing input to the blobs are located in the thin 
stripes in V2. The connections are reciprocal: injections of horseradish peroxidase into 
thin stripes label cells in V1 blobs.38,45–48 In contrast, the interblob regions project to the 
pale stripes. The thick stripes receive primarily magnocellular information from layers 4B 
and 4Cα. Remarkably, this functional subdivision can even be distinguished at a molecular 
level; for instance, the monoclonal antibody Cat-301 preferentially labels magnocellular 
pathways throughout the monkey visual cortex.49,50
Magnocellular neurons that respond to depth or to movement are abundant in V2.14,51 
An example is shown in Figure 3.13. In this experiment, a dye that changes emission in 
response to changes in intracellular calcium concentration was injected into area V2 of a 
cat. Individual cells responded preferentially to movement of visual stimuli in one direction. 
This figure shows that resolution at the level of single cells can be achieved in living cortex.

Relations between Ocular Dominance 
and Orientation Columns
Ocular dominance and orientation columns represent just two functional arrangements that 
apply to neurons in visual cortex. Direction of movement, spatial frequency (essentially a 
reflection of receptive field size), and image disparity (an important determinant in depth 
perception)24,51–53 also appear in columnar arrangements in the cortex. The question then 
arises as to how all necessary aspects of image analysis can be carried out for each point 
on the retinotopically mapped cortex. The intermingling of functional columns shown in 
Figure 3.14 provides part of the answer. Indeed, long before optical imaging was used to 
observe such relationships, Hubel and Wiesel proposed a conceptual scheme they termed a 
hypercolumn (also known as “ice cube”). In the hypercolumn, all possible orientations for 
corresponding regions of the visual field for both eyes could be represented. An adjacent 
hypercolumn would analyze information in the same way for an adjacent but overlapping 
part of the visual field and so on, until the entire retina was mapped across the cortex.
Once the pinwheel arrangements for cells with particular orientation preferences were 
found, it was clear that the ice-cube hypercolumn was an oversimplification.30 When opti-
cal imaging methods are used to reveal the relationship between orientation and ocular 
dominance columns, a complex picture is seen, such as that shown in Figure 3.15. In this 
experiment, cortical activity was imaged for eye-specific stimulation and for stimulation 
with a series of oriented bars. In Figure 3.15, each orientation contour is indicated by a 
separate color (an iso-orientation contour). Ocular dominance zones (or columns) are 
shown by dark lines and in B as clear or shaded. The orientation pinwheels are clearly seen 
as the convergence of iso-orientation contours, and a set of contour lines between pinwheels 
typically crosses an ocular dominance boundary at right angles (as in the original Hubel 
and Wiesel hypercolumn). That is, most orientation domains are split into ipsilateral and

contralateral halves, and thus serve the two eyes for that region of visual space. Each pinwheel 
center tends to occur near the center of an ocular dominance patch.30,35
Horizontal Intracortical Connections
In V1 additional connections have been described that suggest principles of organization 
in addition to those we have considered thus far. Whereas classical staining techniques (as 
described in Figure 3.4), such as Golgi impregnation, revealed a preponderance of neuronal 
processes that run perpendicularly from layer to layer, intracellular injections of single cells 
have demonstrated that cortical neurons also have long horizontal processes that extend 
laterally from column to column (Figure 3.16).54–56 Connections such as these contribute 
to the synthesis of elongated receptive fields of simple cells in layer 6 of V1: The receptive 
fields of layer 5 cells are combined and added end-to-end on the layer 6 simple cell by way 
of long horizontal axons. Many simple and complex cells are found with long horizontal 
projections that extend more than 8 mm, corresponding to several hypercolumns. An in-
dividual neuron can therefore integrate information over an area of retina several times 
larger than the receptive field measured by conventional electrophysiological techniques. 
Of particular interest is that connections are made only between columns that have 
similar orientation specificity. Evidence for such specific interconnections has been obtained 
by two additional methods. First, when labeled microbeads are injected into one column, 
they are transported to a distant hypercolumn with the same orientation preference (see 
Figure 3.16B). Second, by cross-correlation of the firing patterns of neurons with the same 
orientation preference in two widely separated columns, one can show that the neurons

the picture is more complex than the original ice

similar. (After Ts’o et al., 2009.)

are interconnected. Moreover, after a lesion has been made in the retina, cortical cells that 
have been deprived of input can show responses to distant stimuli that would be outside 
their normal receptive fields.41
In spite of its incompleteness, the original ice cube scheme shown in Figure 3.14 still 
represents the simplest way to imagine how orientation, color, and eye preference may 
be combined. There remains the challenge of incorporating additional features of visual 
analysis, such as the perception of depth and movement, into a comprehensive scheme. 
Construction of a Single, Unified Visual Field from Inputs 
Arising in Two Eyes
A problem arises from the fact that each half of the brain deals only with the visual 
field on the opposite side of the world. How are the representations in the two cortices 
knitted together to produce the single image of the world that we perceive? That each 
hemicortex is wired to perceive one-half of the external world but not the other is a 
general property of the two hemispheres in relation to perception, not just for vision, 
but also for sensations of touch and position. What happens at the midline? How do 
the two sides of our brain knit the right world and the left world together with no hint 
of a seam or discontinuity?
The obvious way to preserve continuity is to join the left and the right visual fields 
together at the midline, in register. Such interactions would allow a complete picture to be 
formed with specific connections between the two hemispheres. There would, however, 
be little purpose in linking fields seen out of the corners of the two eyes that look on quite 
different parts of the world. Highly specific connections between neurons with receptive 
fields exactly at the midline have been found experimentally to run from cortex to cortex 
through the corpus callosum.57 They are described in Box 3.1.

stimulation with vertically oriented bars of light. The labeled microspheres are found in 2-deoxy-
glucose-labeled areas, showing that horizontal connections occur between cells with the same 
orientation specificity. (A from Gilbert and Wiesel, 1983; B from Gilbert and Wiesel, 1989; kindly

Association Areas of Visual Cortex
In Chapter 23, we describe how psychophysical measurements, electrical recordings, brain 
imaging, and studies of patients with specific lesions have demonstrated the presence of 
physically separate brain regions beyond V1 (Figure 3.17), the visual association areas. 
These regions are concerned with different aspects of visual analysis, such as perception 
of depth, color,64 movement, and faces.18 It will be shown in Chapter 23, for example, 
that localized lesions of a small area (V4) lead to loss of all color vision in patients: they 
see everything in black and white, but have no defects in their memory—consciousness 
or intellect.13 Similarly, it will be shown that in another area, the middle temporal cortex 
(MT; also known as V5), neurons are clustered that respond specifically to movements in 
specific directions and to depth perception. 
MT is of particular interest since experiments made in this area bear on a general question 
regarding all the experiments described so far: does a neuron that responds to a particular 
■  BOX 3.1
Corpus Callosum
The general question of transfer of information be-
tween the hemispheres has been studied in humans 
and in monkeys by Sperry, Gazzaniga, Berlucchi, 
and their colleagues.58–62 Concentrating on the co-
ordinating role of the corpus callosum, a bundle of 
fibers that runs between the two hemispheres, they 
have shown that the fibers are involved in the trans-
fer of information and learning from one hemisphere 
to the other. Thus, the fusing or knitting together of 
the two fields of vision is mediated by fibers in the 
corpus callosum. Certain cells have receptive fields 
that straddle the midline and receive information 
about both sides of the visual world. These cells lie 
at the boundary of V1 and V2, and they combine 
inputs from both hemispheres by way of the corpus 
callosum. Interestingly, these cells lie in layer 3, 
which contains neurons known to send their axons 
to other regions of cortex. The organization and 
orientation preference of two receptive fields that are 
brought together in this way are similar. Projections 
from nerve cells in one hemisphere to the other have 
been shown anatomically by injecting horseradish 
peroxidase into the cortex at the boundary of V1 
and V2.63 Enzyme taken up by terminals is trans-
ported to neuronal cell bodies situated at exactly 
corresponding sites in opposite hemispheres. Cut-
ting or cooling (which blocks conduction) the corpus 
callosum causes the receptive field to shrink and 
become confined to just one side of the midline (the usual 
arrangement for cortical cells). Furthermore, recordings from 
single fibers in the callosum show that they have receptive 
fields close to the midline, not in the periphery.
The role of callosal fibers is clearly demonstrated in an 
experiment of Berlucchi and Rizzolatti.60 They made a longitu-
dinal cut through the optic chiasm, thereby severing all direct 
connections to the cortex from the contralateral eye. Yet, 
provided the corpus callosum was intact, some cells in the 
cortex with fields close to the midline could still respond to 
appropriate visual stimulation of the contralateral eye.
The lateralization of cortical function is shown schemati-
cally in the figure. The left hand and left visual field project 
to the right hemisphere. The right hand and right visual field 
project to the left hemisphere, in which specialized language 
function resides.

stimulus, say a vertical bar moving towards the left, actually take part in the perception 
of the event by the animal? Or is it simply a concomitant along the sensory pathway? By 
stimulating and recording from single columns, Newsome and his colleagues have shown 
that individual columns and individual cells are indeed directly involved in the perception 
of movement in a specific direction.65,66 Discussion of these elegant experiments requires 
more background knowledge and will be presented later in Chapter 23.
Where Do We Go from Here?
It has become possible to approach experimentally many longstanding questions about how 
the brain analyzes visual scenes falling on the retina. Results from anatomical, physiological, 
and psychophysical experiments have converged to reveal cortical circuits for perception. 
One important principle derived from such studies is that separate pathways beginning at the 
retina do extend through to consciousness. You can fool the systems used for assessing depth 
(Figure 3.18) and for detecting movement by using light and perspective 
conditions that bring in only the parvocellular or magnocellular chan-
nels; moreover, patients with lesions to specific areas of cortex can lose 
color vision with little impairment of their ability to recognize patterns.
An impressive aspect of the work on vision is the way in which 
redundant features of the image on the retina become jettisoned. Discon-
tinuities in lines, angles, shading, and color are what the cortex deals with.
Still lacking is a comprehensive explanation of how the brain puts 
together the complete image that we see. Within V1 there is good evidence

of cellular mechanisms. (After Shepard, 1990.)

for a hierarchical principle, according to which inputs from lower order cells combine to 
create new and more complex messages in target cells. But the primary visual area is merely 
the first stage for cortical processing, sending visual input onward for further analysis and 
perception. You do not see with V1; it is only a way station on the way to seeing. Furthermore, 
the visual association areas are not merely successive, receiving stations. They feed back 
into V1 and interact among themselves. It is a sobering thought that we do not even know 
why so many fibers descend from V1 to the lateral geniculate nucleus. What seems to be a 
necessary next step is the development of novel imaging or recording techniques that do 
more than simply light up an area that is active at a particular instant. Rather, informa-
tion needs to be obtained about the activity of large numbers of individual neurons at 
the cellular level, simultaneously millisecond by millisecond over prolonged periods and 
over large areas of the brain in conscious animals and human beings. Although intriguing 
speculations and books appear regularly about how the big picture is made, it must be said 
that we still do not have hard evidence or a comprehensive theory (but see Hawkins and 
Blakeslee, 2004 and Chapter 23).

SUMMARY
 
■
Inputs from the two eyes segregate to different layers of 
the lateral geniculate nucleus.
 
■
The layers are in retinotopic register. Neurons in each layer 
are functionally distinct, comprising magnocellular-, 
parvocellular-, or koniocellular-response types.
 
■
The six layers of primary visual cortex serve as input 
and output stages of cortical processing.
 
■
Geniculate afferents from the two eyes are 
segregated in layer 4C of striate cortex, establishing 
ocular dominance columns that can be detected 
physiologically and anatomically.
 
■
Magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the LGN 
project specifically to different sublayers of cortical 
layer 4C.
 
■
Neurons in primary visual cortex are organized 
according to eye preference and orientation selectivity.
 
■
Most cortical neurons receive input from corresponding 
points in the visual field of the two eyes. 
 
■
The layout of ocular dominance slabs and orientation 
pinwheels can be visualized by the imaging of activity-
dependent optical signals from the brain surface. 
 
■
Iso-orientation contours tend to intersect ocular 
dominance domains at right angles, and each 
orientation domain is shared between two ocular 
dominance columns.
 
■
Magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular pathways 
form parallel channels from the retina to V1 and beyond. 
 
■
Small areas, called blobs, in the center of each ocular 
dominance column are revealed by cytochrome oxidase 
staining and code for color. 
 
■
Imaging techniques allow one to map projections to 
primary and secondary visual areas as well as still more 
highly specialized regions concerned with the analysis 
of form, movement, color, and depth.

■ PART II
Electrical Properties
of Neurons and Glia
This section deals with the functional and structural properties of the neuron 
that enable it to generate and transmit electrical signals, and sets the stage 
for following sections that deal with how neurons, once activated, transmit 
their signals from one to another in order produce integrated behavior.
We begin in Chapter 4 with the functional properties of ion channels in the 
nerve cell membrane. These channels determine the electrical characteris-
tics of the neuron by allowing selective movement of ions into and out of the 
cell at rest and during signal generation. In Chapter 5 we discuss how the 
molecular structure of ion channels accounts for their ion selectivity and en-
ables them to regulate ion movements in response to a variety of stimuli.
In Chapter 6 we move on to the behavior of the membrane as a whole and 
describe how its overall ion selectivity determines the resting membrane 
potential of the cell. Chapter 7 discusses in detail how selective activation of 
voltage-activated cation channels, principally sodium and potassium chan-
nels, leads to the generation of the action potential, which is the basis of 
all long-distance signaling in the nervous system. Chapter 8 describes how 
subthreshold “passive” signals spread in nerve fibers, and how the action 
potential, once initiated, is transmitted from one region of the neuron to the 
next.
In Chapter 9 we consider mechanisms for active transport of ions across 
the cell membrane, transport necessary to maintain the ionic composition of 
the cytoplasm in the face of constant leaks of ions into and out of the cell at 
rest and during electrical activity. Finally, in Chapter 10 we discuss the func-
tional properties of glial cells and how glia and neurons interact during signal 
transmission.


■ CHAPTER 4
Ion Channels and Signaling
E
lectrical signals in nerve cells are all mediated by the flow of ions though aqueous pores in 
the nerve cell membrane. These pores are formed by transmembrane proteins called ion 
channels. It is possible to record and measure ionic currents through single channels. In 
this chapter, we discuss the functional properties of ion channels, such as their specificity for one 
ion species or another and how their activity is regulated. Most individual channels are selective 
for either cations or anions, and some cationic channels are highly selective for a single ion spe-
cies, such as sodium. 
Channels fluctuate between open and closed states, often with a characteristic open time. Their 
contribution to the flow of ionic current across the cell membrane is determined by the amount of 
time that they spend in the open state. Channel opening is regulated by a variety of mechanisms. 
Some of these are physical, such as changes in membrane tension or membrane potential; oth-
ers are chemical, involving the binding of activating molecules (ligands) to sites on the extracellular 
mouth of the channel or of particular ions or molecules to the inner mouth.
In addition to kinetics of opening and closing, an important property of channels is the ability 
of an open channel to pass ionic current. One way in which ions can pass through a channel is by 
simple diffusion; another is by interacting with internal binding sites, hopping from one to the next as 
they pass through the pore. In either case, movement through the channel is passive, driven by con-
centration gradients and by the electrical potential gradient across the membrane. The ability of ions 
to move through the open channel down their electrochemical gradients depends on the permeabil-
ity of the channel to the ion species involved and the concentration of the ions at either mouth of the 
channel. These two factors, permeability and concentration, determine the channel conductance.

64 Chapter 4
In Chapter 1, we discussed how the transfer of information in the nervous system is medi-
ated by two types of electrical signals in nerve cells: graded potentials, which are localized 
to specific regions of the nerve cell membrane, and action potentials, which are propagated 
along the entire length of a neuronal process. These signals are superimposed on a steady 
electrical potential across the cell membrane, called the resting membrane potential. De-
pending upon cell type, nerve cells at rest have steady membrane potentials ranging from 
about –30 mV to almost –100 mV. The negative sign indicates that the inside of the mem-
brane is negative with respect to the outside. Signaling in the nervous system is mediated 
by changes in the membrane potential. For example, in sensory receptors, an appropriate 
stimulus, such as touch, sound, or light, causes local depolarization (making the membrane 
potential less negative) or hyperpolarization (membrane potential more negative). Similarly, 
neurotransmitters at synapses act by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing the postsynaptic cell. 
Action potentials, which are large, brief pulses of depolarization, propagate along axons to 
carry information from one place to the next in the nervous system.
All such changes in membrane potential are produced by the movement of ions across 
the nerve cell membrane. For example, inward movement of positively charged sodium 
ions reduces the net negative charge on the inner surface of the membrane or, in other 
words, causes depolarization. Conversely, outward movement of potassium ions results in 
an increase in net negative charge, causing hyperpolarization, as does inward movement 
of negatively charged chloride ions. 
How do ions move across the cell membrane, and how is their movement regulated? 
The pathway for rapid movement of ions into and out of the cell is through ion channels, 
which are protein molecules that span the membrane and form pores through which 
ions can pass. Ion currents are regulated by controlling the rate at which these channels 
open and close. Thus, a variety of channel types in the membrane enables neurons to 
receive signals from the external world, or from other neurons, to carry signals over long 
distances, to modulate the activity of other neurons and effector organs, and to alter their 
own signaling properties in response to internal metabolic changes. All of the complexities 
of perception and analysis of neural signals depend ultimately on ion channel activity, as 
does the generation of complex motor outputs from the nervous system.
Properties of Ion Channels
The Nerve Cell Membrane
Cell membranes consist of a fluid mosaic of lipid and protein molecules. As shown in Fig-
ure 4.1A, the lipid molecules are arranged in a bilayer about 6 nm in thickness, with their 
polar, hydrophilic heads facing outward and their hydrophobic tails extending to the middle 
of the layer. The lipid is sparingly permeable to water and virtually impermeable to ions. 
Embedded in the lipid bilayer are protein molecules, some on the extracellular side, some 
facing the cytoplasm, and some spanning the membrane. Many of the membrane-spanning 
proteins form ion channels. Ions such as potassium, sodium, calcium, or chloride, move 
through such channels passively, driven by concentration gradients and by the electrical 
potential across the membrane. 
Another set of membrane-spanning proteins function as transport molecules (pumps and 
transporters) that move substances across the membrane against their electrochemical gradients. 
Transport molecules maintain the ionic composition of the cytoplasm by pumping back across 
the cell membrane ion species that have leaked through channels into or out of the cell. They also 
perform the important function of carrying metabolic substances, such as glucose and amino 
acids, across cell membranes. Properties of transport molecules are discussed in Chapter 9.
What Does an Ion Channel Look Like?
The molecular composition of ion channels, and their configuration in the cell membrane 
are discussed in detail in later chapters, but it is useful at this point to have some idea of 
the general physical features of an ion channel protein. These are illustrated in Figure 
4.1B. The protein spans the membrane, with a central water-filled pore open to both the 
intracellular and extracellular spaces. On each side of the membrane, the pore widens to 

Ion Channels and Signaling 65
form a vestibule. Within the plane of the membrane, a segment of the pore is constricted 
and lined with a ring of negative charges to form a selectivity filter for cations. Conversely, 
a ring of positive charges would promote anion selectivity. Finally, the channel contains a 
gate that opens and closes to control ion movement through the channel. The size of the 
protein varies considerably from one channel type to the next, and some have additional 
structural features. Figure 4.1B represents a channel of medium dimensions. 
Channel Selectivity
Membrane channels vary considerably in their selectivity: some are permeable to cations, 
some to anions. Some cation channels are selective for a single ion species, and allow perme-
ation of sodium, potassium or calcium almost exclusively. Others are relatively nonspecific, 
allowing the passage of even small organic cations. Anion channels involved in signaling 
tend to have low specificity but are referred to as chloride channels, because chloride is 
the major permeant anion in biological solutions. There are also channels that connect 
adjacent cells (connexons) and allow the passage of most inorganic ions and many small 
organic molecules. These will be discussed in Chapter 8. 
Open and Closed States
It is convenient to represent protein molecules as static structures; however, they are 
never still. Because of their thermal energies, all large molecules are inherently dynamic. 
At room temperature, chemical bonds stretch and relax, and twist and wave around their 
equilibrium positions. Although individual movements are only of the order of 10–12
meters in magnitude, with frequencies approaching 1013 Hz, such atomic trembling can 
underlie much larger and slower changes in conformation of the molecule. This is because 
numerous rapid motions of the atoms occasionally allow groups to slide by one another 
in spite of mutual repulsive interactions that would otherwise keep them in place. Such a 
transition, once achieved, can last for many milliseconds or even seconds. An example is 
hemoglobin, in which the binding sites for oxygen to the heme groups are buried inside 
the molecule and not immediately accessible. Oxygen binding, and its subsequent escape, 
can be accomplished only when a transient access pathway to the heme pocket is formed.1
In ion channel proteins, molecular transitions occur between open and closed states, 
with transitions between states being virtually instantaneous. If we examine the behavior of 
any given channel, we find that open times vary randomly—sometimes the channel opens 
for only a millisecond or less, sometimes for very much longer (see Figure 4.5). However, 
each channel has its own characteristic mean open time (τ) around which individual open 
times fluctuate. 
Some channels in the resting cell membrane open frequently; thus, the probability of 
finding such channels in the open state is relatively high. Most of these are potassium and

cal or biochemical conditions. A sodium 
ion, surrounded by a single shell of water 
molecules, is shown to scale in the pore for 
size comparison.

66 Chapter 4
chloride channels associated with the resting membrane potential. Other channel types are 
predominantly in the closed state, and the probability of an individual channel opening is low. 
When such channels are activated by an appropriate stimulus, the probability of openings 
increases sharply. On the other hand, channels that open frequently at rest may be deactivated
by a stimulus (i.e., their frequency of opening is decreased). An important point to remember 
is that activation or deactivation of a channel means an increase or decrease in the probability 
of channel opening, not an increase or decrease in the mean channel open time. 
In addition to activation and deactivation, there are two other conditions that regulate 
current flow through ion channels. The first is that certain channels can enter a conforma-
tional state in which activation no longer occurs, even though the activating stimulus is still 
present. In channels that respond to depolarization of the cell membrane, this condition is 
called inactivation; in channels that respond to chemical stimuli, the condition is known as 
desensitization. The second condition is open channel block. For example, a large molecule 
(such as a toxin) can bind to a channel and physically occlude the pore. Another example is 
the block of some cation channels by magnesium ions, which do not permeate the channel 
but bind in its inner mouth and prevent the permeation of other cations. 
Modes of Activation
Figure 4.2 summarizes the modes of channel activation. Some channels respond specifi-
cally to physical changes in the nerve cell membrane. Most important in this group are the 
voltage-activated channels. An example is the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, which is 
responsible for the regenerative depolarization that underlies the rising phase of the action 
potential (see Chapter 7). Also in this group are stretch-activated channels, responding to 
mechanical distortion of the cell membrane. These are found, for example, in mechano-
receptors in the skin (see Chapter 18). 
Other channels are activated when chemical agonists attach to binding sites on the 
channel protein. These ligand-activated channels are further divided into two subgroups, 
depending on whether the binding sites are extracellular or intracellular. Those respond-
ing to extracellular activation include, for example, cation channels in the postsynaptic 
membranes of skeletal muscle that are activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine 
(ACh), released from presynaptic nerve terminals (see Chapter 11). This activation allows 
sodium to enter the cell, causing muscle depolarization. Channels activated intracellularly

Activation. The probability of chan-

to changes in the physical state of the 
membrane, specifically: changes in 
membrane potential (voltage-activated), 
and mechanical distortion (stretch-
activated). (B) Ligand-activated channels 
respond to chemical agonists, which 
attach to binding sites on the channel 
protein. Neurotransmitters, such as gly-
cine and acetylcholine, act on extracellu-
lar binding sites. Included among a wide 
variety of intracellular ligands are calcium 
ions, subunits of G proteins, and cyclic 
nucleotides.

Ion Channels and Signaling 67
may be sensitive to local changes in concentration of a specific ion. For example, one type 
of potassium channel is activated by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration 
in the adjacent cytoplasm. In many neurons, these calcium-activated potassium channels 
play a role in repolarizing the membrane during termination of the action potential. Other 
intracellular ligands that modulate channel opening include the cyclic nucleotides: cyclic 
GMP is responsible for the activation of cation channels in retinal rods, thereby playing 
an important role in visual transduction (see Chapter 20). 
It should be noted that these classifications are not rigid: some calcium-activated 
potassium channels are also voltage-sensitive, and some voltage-activated channels are 
sensitive to intracellular ligands.
Measurement of Single-Channel Currents
Intracellular Recording with Microelectrodes
The first experiments designed to examine the properties of membrane channels were done 
using glass microelectrodes to record membrane potentials or membrane currents from 
whole cells. In 1949, Ling and Gerard2 adapted the glass microelectrode for intracellular 
recording from single cells. This achievement was a milestone as important as the intro-
duction of patch clamp recording 3 decades later. The technique provided a method for 
accurate measurements of resting membrane potentials, action potentials, and responses 
to synaptic activation in muscle fibers and neurons. 
The intracellular recording technique is illustrated in Figure 4.3A. A sharp glass micro-
pipette, with a tip diameter of less than 0.5 μm and filled with a concentrated salt solution 
(e.g., 3M KCl), serves as an electrode and is connected to an amplifier to record the potential 
at the tip of the pipette. When the pipette is pushed against the cell membrane, penetration 
into the cytoplasm is signaled by the sudden appearance of the resting potential. If the 
penetration is successful, the membrane seals around 
the outer surface of the pipette, so that the cytoplasm 
remains isolated from the extracellular fluid. 
Channel Noise
In the early 1970s, Katz and Miledi3 did pioneering 
experiments on frog muscle fibers, in which they used 
intracellular recording techniques to examine the char-
acteristics of the noise produced by acetylcholine (ACh) 
at the neuromuscular junction. At this synapse, ACh 
released from the presynaptic nerve terminal opens

(A) Arrangement for recording membrane potentials of muscle 
fibers with a microelectrode. Electrode is connected to a pream-
plifier, and the signals are displayed on an oscilloscope or com-
puter screen. Penetration of the electrode into a fiber is marked 
by sudden appearance of the resting potential (downward 
deflection on the screen). After penetration, changes in potential, 
resulting from channel activation, can be measured. (B) Intracel-
lular records of the effect of acetylcholine (Ach). In this experi-
ment, additional circuitry was used to record membrane current 
(rather than membrane potential). At rest (upper trace), there is 
no current across the membrane; application of acetylcholine 
(ACh) produces about 130 nanoamperes (nA) of inward current 
(lower trace). (C) Traces in (B) are shown at greater amplification. 
There is little fluctuation in the baseline at rest; the inward current 
produced by ACh shows relatively large fluctuations (“noise”), 
which is due to random opening and closing of ACh-activated 
channels. Analysis of the increased noise yields values for the 
single-channel current and mean open time of the channels. 
(Records modified from Anderson and Stevens, 1973.)

68 Chapter 4
ligand-gated channels in the postsynaptic membrane. These channels allow cations to en-
ter, thus depolarizing the muscle (see Chapter 11). Katz and Miledi applied ACh directly 
to the synaptic region and observed that the resulting depolarization was “noisy”; that 
is, during the depolarization, fluctuations in the electrical recording were larger than the 
normal baseline fluctuations at rest. This increase in noise was due to the random opening 
and closing of the ACh-activated channels. In other words, application of ACh resulted in 
the opening of a large number of channels, and this number fluctuated in a random way 
as ACh molecules bombarded the membrane. 
By applying noise analysis techniques, Katz and Miledi were able to obtain informa-
tion about the behavior of the individual channels activated by ACh. Subsequently, in 
similar experiments on the same preparation, Anderson and Stevens4 used fluctuations 
in membrane current to deduce the size and duration of ionic currents through single 
channels (see Figure 4.3).
Although noise analysis involves moderately complex algebra, the principles underlying 
it are straightforward. First, if the single channel currents are relatively large, then the noise 
will be large as well. Second, channels that open for a relatively long time will produce only 
low-frequency noise; channels that open only briefly will produce higher frequency noise. 
Examination of the amplitude and the frequency composition of the noise produced by 
ACh-activated channels at the neuromuscular junction showed that about 10 million ions 
per second flowed through an open channel and that the mean open time of the channels 
(τ) was 1–2 milliseconds. 
Patch Clamp Recording
Noise analysis has been largely supplanted by direct observation of channel currents, us-
ing patch clamp recording methods. These methods provide direct answers to questions 
of obvious physiological interest about channels; for example, how much current does a 
single channel carry? How long does a channel stay open? How do its open and closed 
times depend on voltage or on the activating molecule?
The development of the patch clamp by Erwin Neher, Bert Sakmann, and their col-
leagues,5,6 has made an enormous contribution to our knowledge of the functional behavior 
of membrane channels. Patch clamp recording methods involve sealing the tip of a small 
(ca. 1 μm internal diameter) glass pipette to the membrane of a cell (Figure 4.4A). Under 
ideal conditions, with slight suction on the pipette, a seal resistance of greater than 109
ohms (hence a gigaohm seal) is formed around the rim of the pipette tip between the cell 
membrane and the glass (Figure 4.4B).
Patch clamp methods permit other recording configurations. Having made a seal to 
form a cell-attached patch, we can then pull the patch from the cell to form an inside-out 
patch (Figure 4.4C), with the cytoplasmic face of the patch membrane facing the bathing 
solution. Alternatively, after forming a cell-attached path, we can apply slight additional 
suction to rupture the membrane inside the patch and thereby provide access to the cell 
cytoplasm. In this condition, currents are recorded from the entire cell (whole-cell recording; 
Figure 4.4D). Finally, we may first obtain a whole-cell recording and then pull the electrode 
away from the cell to form a thin neck of membrane that separates and seals to form an 
outside-out patch (Figure 4.4E). Each of these configurations has an advantage, depending 
upon the type of channels studied and the kind of information one wishes to obtain. For 
example, if we want to apply a variety of chemical ligands to the outer membrane of the 
patch, then an outside-out patch is most convenient. 
Whatever kind of patch is used, small currents across the patch membrane can be 
recorded by connecting the pipette to an appropriate amplifier (Figure 4.4F). The high-
resistance seal ensures that such currents flow through the amplifier rather than escaping 
through the rim of the patch. The recorded events consist of rectangular pulses of current, 
reflecting the opening and closing of single channels. In other words, one observes in real 
time the activity of single-protein molecules in the membrane.
One feature of whole-cell recording with a patch pipette is that substances can move 
between the cell cytoplasm and the pipette solution. This exchange (sometimes referred 
to as dialysis) can be useful in providing a method for changing the preexisting intracel-
lular ion concentrations to those in the pipette. On the other hand, particularly if the cell

is small, important cytoplasmic components can be lost rapidly into the pipette solution. 
Such loss can be avoided by use of a perforated patch.7 The patch pipette is loaded with a 
pore-forming substance (e.g., the antibiotic nystatin) and a seal is formed to the cell. After 
a delay, pores are formed in the patch that allow whole-cell currents to be recorded without 
loss of intracellular macromolecules.
Single-Channel Currents
In their simplest form, single-channel current pulses appear irregularly, with nearly fixed 
amplitudes and variable durations (Figure 4.5A). However, in some cases, current records 
are more complex. For instance, channels exhibit open states with more than one current 
level, as in Figure 4.5B, where the open channels often close to smaller “substate” levels. In 
addition, channels may display complicated kinetics, such as channel openings that occur 
in bursts (Figure 4.5C).
In summary, patch clamp techniques offer two advantages for studying the behavior of 
channels. First, the isolation of a small patch of membrane allows allows us to observe the

membrane can then be ruptured to form an inside-out patch (C). Alternatively, the

whole-cell recording (D) or by pulling, to obtain an outside-out patch (E). (F) Record-
ing arrangement. Patch electrode is connected to an amplifier that converts channel 
currents to voltage signals. The signals are then displayed on an oscilloscope trace

be measured. (A–E after Hamill et al., 1981.)

activity of only a few channels, rather than the thousands that may be active in an intact 
cell; and second, the very high resistance of the seal enables us to record extremely small 
currents. As a result, we are able to obtain accurate measures of the amplitudes of single-
channel currents and to analyze the kinetic behavior of the channels. 
Channel Conductance
The kinetic behavior of a channel—that is, the durations of its closed and open states—
can provide information about the steps involved in channel activation and the rate 
constants associated with these steps. The channel current, on the other hand, is a direct 
measure of how rapidly ions move through a channel. The current depends not only on 
channel properties but also on the transmembrane potential. Consider, for example, the 
outside-out membrane patch in Figure 4.6, which contains a single, spontaneously ac-
tive channel that is permeable to potassium. The solutions in both the patch pipette and 
the bath contain 150 mM potassium. Potassium ions move in both directions through 
the open channel but, because the concentrations are equal, there is no net movement 
in either direction. Thus, no current is seen (Figure 4.6B). Fortunately, the patch clamp 
recording system allows us to apply a voltage to the pipette solution and thereby produce 
a voltage difference across the membrane patch. When a voltage of +20 mV is applied 
(Figure 4.6C), each channel opening results in a pulse of outward current, because posi-
tively charged potassium ions are driven outward through the channel by the electrical 
gradient between the pipette solution and the bath. On the other hand, when the inside

is made negative by 20 mV (Figure 4.6D), current flows in the other direction through 
the open channel into the pipette. The effect of voltage on the size of the current is 
plotted in Figure 4.6E. The relationship is linear; the current (I) through the channel is 
proportional to the voltage applied to it:
I = γ(V–V0)
Many readers will recognize this as an expression of Ohm’s law. V0 is the voltage across the 
membrane at which the current is zero, and (V–V0) is the driving force for current through 
the channel. In this example V0 = 0, but that is not always the case (see Figure 4.7). The 
constant of proportionality, γ, is called the channel conductance. It is a measure of the 
ability of the channel to pass current. For a particular applied voltage, a high conductance 
channel will carry a lot of current, while a low conductance channel will carry only a little. 
 The unit of conductance is the siemens (S); 1S = 1 ampere/volt. In nerve cells, the 
potential across the membrane is usually expressed in units of millivolts (1 mV = 10–3V), 
currents through single channels in picoamperes (1 pA = 10–12A), and conductances of single 
channels in picosiemens (1 pS = 10–12S). In Figure 4.6E, a potential of +20 mV produces a 
current of about 2.2 pA, so the channel conductance (γ = I/V) is 2.2 pA/20 mV = 110 pS.

72 Chapter 4
Conductance and Permeability
The conductance of a channel depends upon two factors. The first is the ease with which ions 
can pass through the open channel; this is an intrinsic property of the channel known as the 
channel permeability. The second is the concentration of the ions in the region of the chan-
nel. Clearly, if there are no potassium ions in the inside and outside solutions, there can be 
no current flow through an open potassium channel—no matter how large its permeability 
or how great a potential is applied. If only a few potassium ions are present, then for a given 
permeability and a given potential, the channel current will be smaller than when potassium 
ions are present in abundance. One way to think of these relationships is as follows:
open channel → permeability
permeability + ions → conductance
Equilibrium Potential
In the previous example of channel current in Figure 4.6, the concentration of potassium 
ions was the same on both sides of the membrane patch. What happens when we make the 
concentrations different? Imagine that we make an outside-out patch, as shown in Figure 
4.7A, with potassium concentrations of 3 mM in the bath and 90 mM in the electrode 
(similar to normal extracellular and intracellular potassium concentrations for many cells). 
Under those conditions potassium ions will move through the channels from the pipette 
to the bath down their concentration gradient, even when no potential is applied to the 
pipette (Figure 4.7B). If the pipette is made positive with respect to the bath, the potential 
gradient across the membrane will accelerate the outward potassium ion movement, and 
the channel current will increase (Figure 4.7C). If, on the other hand, if the pipette is made 
negative, outward movement of potassium will be retarded and the channel current will 
decrease (Figure 4.7D). With sufficiently large negativity, potassium ions will flow inward 
across the membrane against their concentration gradient (Figure 4.7E). If we make a 
number of such observations and plot channel current against applied voltage, the result

Ion Channels and Signaling 73
Figure 4.7F illustrates that the potassium current through the channel depends on 
both the electrical potential across the membrane and on the potassium concentration 
gradient—that is, on the electrochemical gradient for potassium. Unlike the result when 
the potassium concentration was the same on both sides of the membrane (Figure 4.6), 
the channel current is zero when the potential applied to the pipette is about –85 mV. In 
this condition, the concentration gradient, which would otherwise produce an outward 
flux of potassium through the channel, is balanced exactly by the electrical potential 
gradient that tends to move potassium inward. The potential that just balances the potas-
sium concentration gradient is called the potassium equilibrium potential, EK. When the 
membrane potential is at EK, the driving force for potassium current is zero; at any other 
potential (V) the driving force is (V–EK). The equilibrium potential depends only on the 
ion concentrations on either side of the membrane and not on the properties of the channel 
or the mechanism of ion permeation through the channel.
The Nernst Equation
Exactly how large a potential is required to balance a given potassium concentration dif-
ference across the membrane? One guess might be that EK would be proportional simply 
to the difference between the inside concentration [K]i and the outside concentration [K]o; 
however, this assumption is not quite right. It turns out instead that the required potential 
depends on the difference between the logarithms of the concentrations:

The constant k is given by RT/zF, where R is the thermodynamic gas constant, T the absolute

This is the Nernst equation for potassium. RT/zF has the dimensions of volts and is equal 
to about 25 mV at room temperature (20°C). It is sometimes more convenient to use the 
logarithm to the base 10 (log) of the concentration ratio, rather than the natural logarithm 
(ln). Then RT/zF must be multiplied by ln (10), or 2.31, which gives a value of 58 mV.

At mammalian body temperature (37°C), 58 mV increases to about 61 mV. For the cell shown 
in Figure 4.7, the value of EK (–85 mV) agrees with the given concentration ratio (1/30). 
 It should be noted that the rate of diffusion of an ion down a concentration gradient 
is not strictly related to its concentration. In all but the very weakest solutions, ions are 
subject to interactions with one another, for example electrostatic attraction or repulsion. 
The result of such interactions is that the effective concentration of the ion is reduced. 
The effective concentration of an ion in solution is called its activity. In theory, the Nernst 
equation should be written with an activity ratio rather than a concentration ratio. How-
ever, because the total concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell are similar (see 
Chapter 6), the activity ratio for any particular ion is not significantly different from its 
concentration ratio. 
Nonlinear Current–Voltage Relations
A second feature of the current–voltage relation in Figure 4.7F is that, unlike the one in 
Figure 4.6E, it is not linear. As we move away from the equilibrium potential in the depo-
larizing direction, the outward current increases more and more rapidly as the potential 

74 Chapter 4
approaches zero. Conversely, when the membrane is made more negative (hyperpolar-
ized), the inward current increases more slowly with hyperpolarization, This is because 
of the dependence of conductance on concentration. There is a much higher potassium 
concentration inside the pipette than in the external solution. Consequently there are more 
ions available to carry outward current than to carry inward current. The farther we move 
away from the equilibrium potential, the more prominent the effect becomes, so that the 
current–voltage relation has a marked upward curvature, even though, in this example, 
the channel permeability is quite independent of voltage.
Nonlinear current–voltage relations also occur in some channels because the channels 
themselves rectify (i.e., their permeability is voltage-dependent), allowing ions to move 
through the pores in one direction much more readily than in the other. One example is 
a voltage-sensitive potassium channel, called the inward rectifier channel, which allows 
potassium to move into the cell when the membrane potential is negative to the potassium 
equilibrium potential, but it permits little or no outward movement when the potential 
difference is reversed. Its voltage–current relation is similar to that shown in Box 4.1.
Ion Permeation through Channels 
How do ions actually pass through channels? One way could be by diffusion through a 
water-filled pore. Diffusion formed the basis of early ideas about ion permeation, but for 
most channels diffusion does not provide an adequate description of the permeation process. 
This is because the channels themselves interact with the ions. For example, because they 
are charged, ions in solution are always accompanied by closely apposed water molecules. 
In the case of cations, the water molecules are oriented so that the oxygen molecules, which

Measuring Channel Conductance
Investigators often state that some channel or other has a 
particular conductance, say 100 pS. Because conductance 
depends upon concentration, such a statement tells us little 
unless we know the ionic conditions under which the mea-
surement was made. For example, if the stated conductance 
is that of a potassium channel with a potassium concentra-
tion of 150 mM on either side of the membrane, then in a 
more physiological environment, with a potassium concentra-
tion of only 5mM on the extracellular side, the channel con-
ductance can be expected to be five to ten times smaller.
A second problem arises when the current–voltage relation 
is not linear, either because the ion concentrations on either 
side of the channel are not symmetrical (see Figure 4.7F), or 
because the channel itself is heavily rectifying. Under these cir-
cumstances, the conductance is not constant, and it is neces-
sary to specify the potential at which it is measured. One way to 
define the conductance is to use the relation γ = I/(V–V0). In the 
accompanying illustration, the equilibrium potential for the cur-
rent (V0) is –75 mV. When the patch is held at V = –25 mV, the 
driving force is 50 mV and the channel current is 0.6 pA. Thus 
the channel conductance is 0.6 pA/50 mV = 12 pS. This is the 
chord conductance of the channel at –25 mV, and is represent-
ed by the slope of the solid red line. The chord conductance at 
–25 mV is not the same as the chord conductance at –50 mV.
A second way of specifying conductance is to measure 
the slope of the current–voltage relation (dI/dV) at the point 
of interest. This is called the slope conductance. In this 
illustration, the slope of the current–voltage relation at –25 mV 
(dashed line) is about 3 pS. The measurement tells us that 
although the channel is passing a substantial current at –25 
mV, it will not pass proportionately more as the driving force is 
increased. 
In summary, the conductance characteristics of a chan-
nel can be specified precisely only by showing a complete 
current–voltage relation and by specifying the ionic conditions 
under which it was obtained. Single numbers given in the liter-
ature for channel conductance usually refer to chord conduc-
tance and, in the absence of additional information, provide 
only a rough indication of the channel characteristics.

Ion Channels and Signaling 75
carry net negative charges, lie closest to the ion. If the pore is relatively narrow, then an 
ion must acquire a certain amount of energy in order to escape from its associated waters 
of hydration and squeeze through the neck of the channel (see Chapter 5). Once in the 
channel, the ion may be attracted to or repelled by electrostatic charges lining the channel 
wall, or it may be bound to sites from which it must escape to continue its journey. Such 
interactions affect both ion selectivity and rate of ion flux through the channel. Channel 
models that deal with ion permeation in this way are called Eyring rate theory models.8 
In general, such models are more successful than simple diffusion models in describing 
channel selectivity and conductance. 
An important point to remember is that all the ion fluxes that underlie signaling are 
due to ions moving passively through open channels along concentration and potential 
gradients. In other words, the neuron makes use of standing electrochemical gradients to 
generate ion movements, and hence to generate electrical signals. It is obvious that such 
fluxes would eventually dissipate the gradients. This does not happen, however, because 
cells use metabolic energy to maintain the ionic composition of the cytoplasm. Specialized 
mechanisms underlying the active transport of ions are discussed in Chapter 9.

SUMMARY
 
■
Electrical signals in the nervous system are generated 
by the movement of ions across the nerve cell 
membrane. These ionic currents flow through the 
aqueous pores of membrane proteins known as ion 
channels. 
 
■
Channels vary in their selectivity: some cation channels 
allow only sodium, potassium, or calcium to pass, while 
others are less selective. Anion channels are relatively 
nonselective for smaller anions but pass mainly chloride 
ions because of the relative abundance of chloride in 
the extracellular and intracellular fluids. 
 
■
Channels fluctuate between open and closed states. 
Each channel has a characteristic mean open time. 
When channels are activated, their probability of 
opening increases. Deactivation reduces opening 
frequency. Channels may also be inactivated or 
blocked.
 
■
Channels can be classified by their mode of activation: 
stretch-activated, voltage-activated, and ligand-
activated. 
 
■
Ions move through channels passively in response 
to concentration and electrical gradients across the 
membrane. 
 
■
The net flux of ions through a channel down a 
concentration gradient can be reduced by an opposing 
electrical gradient. The electrical potential that reduces 
the net flux to exactly zero is called the equilibrium 
potential for that ion species. The relation between 
equilibrium potential and the concentration gradient is 
given by the Nernst equation.
 
■
The driving force for movement of an ion across the 
membrane is the difference between its equilibrium 
potential and the actual membrane potential. The 
flow of ionic current through a channel depends 
on the driving force for the ion in question and on 
the conductance of the channel for that ion. The 
conductance depends, in turn, on the intrinsic ionic 
permeability of the channel and, in addition, on the 
inside and outside ion concentrations. 


■ CHAPTER 5
Structure of Ion Channels
T
he molecular structure of ion channels has been resolved and related to their functional 
properties by a variety of experimental methods. These include biochemical isolation of 
channel proteins, molecular cloning to determine amino acid sequences of the proteins, 
site-directed mutagenesis to alter the sequences in selected locations, and expression of channel 
proteins in host cells to examine channel function. In addition, high-resolution electron microscopy 
and X-ray crystallography have revealed the three-dimensional structure of ion channels.
These combined experimental approaches have been applied most extensively to a ligand-
activated channel, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). The receptor is composed of five 
separate protein subunits, arranged around a central core. Two of these—the α-subunits—contain 
receptors for the ligand. Each subunit contains a large extracellular domain, a smaller intracellular 
domain, and four membrane-spanning regions (M1–M4), connected by intracellular and extra-
cellular loops. The five M2 regions line the pore and form the channel gating structure. The ACh 
receptor is representative of a genetic superfamily known as Cys-loop receptors, which includes 
receptors for glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT).
Voltage-activated channels form another superfamily. The voltage-activated sodium channel is 
a single large protein molecule with four repeating domains arranged around a central core, each 
with six transmembrane segments (S1–S6). In each domain, the loop of amino acids between 
S5 and S6 dips into the center of the structure to contribute to the pore lining. Voltage-activated 
calcium channels have a similar structure. Voltage-activated potassium channels are similar in mo-
lecular configuration, but with one important difference: instead of being single molecules, they are 
assembled from four separate subunits. 
Detailed knowledge of the molecular structure of the Cys-loop receptors and voltage-
activated channels has provided a firm basis for analyzing the structure and function of other 
channel types.

78 Chapter 5
For the nervous system to function properly, neurons must perform a widely varied rep-
ertoire of electrical behavior. Thus, an impulse generated by one neuron may suppress the 
electrical activity of dozens of its neighbors, travel over long distances to produce excitation 
of other neuronal groups, and influence the responsiveness of still other target neurons in 
a variety of more subtle ways. All of these signals are mediated by the activation or deac-
tivation of ion channels, thereby regulating the flow of ion currents across the nerve cell 
membranes. In this chapter we discuss experiments that have led to our current knowledge 
of the molecular structure of ion channels and how specific structural components are 
related to ion channel function. 
Three experimental advances were instrumental in obtaining this information. The first 
was the development of techniques to isolate and sequence complementary DNA (cDNA) 
clones of channel proteins and thus obtain the corresponding amino acid sequences. 
These techniques also provide the opportunity to alter bases in the DNA (site-directed 
mutagenesis) and thereby substitute one amino acid for another at selected locations in 
the protein. The second advance was the development of techniques whereby messenger 
RNA (mRNA) derived from cDNA clones can be used to express channel proteins in host 
cells such as Xenopus oocytes. In this way, the functional properties of cloned channels 
can be measured. The combination of techniques makes it possible to tinker with specific 
regions of a channel molecule and then to determine how such tinkering affects its func-
tion. For example, changing even a single amino acid can have a marked effect on the ion 
selectivity of a channel. Finally, refined electron microscope imaging procedures and X-ray 
crystallography have provided a detailed physical view of channel structure at the molecular 
level. These approaches have yielded remarkably detailed information about two particular 
channel types: ligand-activated channels, represented by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, 
and voltage-activated cation channels.
Ligand-Activated Channels
The Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor
The first channel to be studied in detail was the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). 
Note that for ligand-activated channels, the word receptor rather than channel is used rou-
tinely; this is because characterization of such molecules has relied primarily on the binding 
of activating molecules (agonists), antagonists, toxins, and antibodies, rather than on the 
specific channel properties of the protein. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are expressed 
in postsynaptic membranes of vertebrate skeletal muscle fibers, in neurons throughout 
the nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates, and in the neuroeffector junctions 
of electric organs of a number of electric fish. The receptors are activated by ACh released 
from presynaptic nerve terminals, and upon activation, open to form channels through 
which cations can enter or leave the postsynaptic cell. They are designated nicotinic because 
the actions of ACh are mimicked by nicotine, and also to distinguish them from the very 
different AChRs that can be activated by muscarine. Muscarinic AChRs (see Chapter 12) 
do not form ion channels; instead, their activation sets in motion intracellular messenger 
systems that, in turn, affect ion channel activity. 
Biochemical isolation and characterization of the nAChR was facilitated by the avail-
ability of a concentrated source of receptors—the remarkably dense assembly of synapses 
on electrocyte membranes in the electric organ of the ray Torpedo. The electrocytes of 
this and other strongly electric fish are modified muscle cells. Large numbers of them 
are arrayed anatomically so that when depolarized simultaneously they can produce, as a 
group, voltages approaching 100 volts, with currents sufficient to stun nearby prey in the 
surrounding water. 
After extraction from the electrocyte membranes, AChR molecules were separated from 
other membrane proteins by using their high affinity for α-bungarotoxin, a neurotoxin known 
to bind to channels with high specificity in intact electrocytes and in vertebrate muscle. 
Protein purification of the Torpedo AChR yielded a 250 kilodaltons (kD) complex, with 
two α-bungarotoxin binding sites. Separation on denaturing gels yielded four glycoprotein 
subunits (α, β, γ, and δ) of about 40, 50, 60, and 65 kD. Because toxin molecules bind to 
the α-subunit and to account for the molecular weight of the intact protein, a pentam-

Structure of Ion Channels 79
eric structure (α2βγδ) was proposed.1 The isolated AChR was shown to retain the major 
functional properties of the native ionic channel when reincorporated into lipid vesicles.2
The size and orientation of the intact channel with respect to the lipid membrane has 
been determined by electron imaging, and by other physical techniques.3–6 Its physical 
structure is shown in Figure 5.1. The five subunits form a circular array around a central 
pore. The extracellular domain extends about 8 nm above the plane of the membrane 
and is about 8 nm in diameter, with a central vestibule 2 nm in diameter leading into the 
transmembrane channel. The hatched area indicates the location of one of two binding 
sites. The second one is on the other α-subunit, adjacent to the δ-subunit. The intracellular 
domain extends about 4 nm below the membrane with five lateral openings between the 
subunits leading from the intracellular end of the channel to the cytoplasm. The pore of 
the open channel is about 0.7 nm in diameter, as predicted from earlier measurements of 
its selectivity to large cations.7,8
Amino Acid Sequence of AChR Subunits
The cDNA for each subunit was cloned and sequenced by S. Numa and his colleagues in 
1982.9–11 Figure 5.2 shows the corresponding amino acid sequence for the α-subunit from 
Torpedo. The sequences of the other three subunits are highly similar (homologous), with 
various amino acid insertions and deletions, so that discussion of the structural configura-
tion of any one subunit is generally applicable to the others. Sequences of subunits from 
human and bovine muscle are slightly different, and an additional subunit, similar to γ 
and designated ε, is found in fetal calf muscle.12
Higher Order Chemical Structure 
Although the primary structure of the subunits does not provide unique information about 
how the polypeptide chains are arranged in the membrane, various models can be made, 
based on the characteristics of the amino acids in the sequence. As with any very large protein, 
segments of the molecule can be expected to fold into ordered secondary structures, such 
as α-helices or β-sheets. These secondary structures themselves fold to produce a tertiary 
structure in each subunit. Finally, five subunits join together to form the final quaternary 
structure (i.e., the complete channel). Models of the secondary and tertiary structures depend 
on a number of considerations, one being the identification of extended runs of nonpolar 
(and hence hydrophobic) amino acid residues in the primary sequence. Such sequences are 
capable of forming α-helices or other structures of sufficient length to span the membrane. 
In the original model proposed by Numa and his colleagues for the subunit structures9 four 
such regions were identified (M1–M4; see Figure 5.2), and the model shown in Figure 5.3 
was postulated. The reader may find it useful to use the hydropathy indices (Box 5.1) of the 
amino acid residues in these regions to verify the validity of these conclusions. 
How do we know which parts of the molecule are extracellular and which are intracel-
lular? To begin with, the NH2 terminal is preceded by a relatively hydrophobic region of 24 
amino acids (see Figure 5.2), which is taken to be the signal sequence necessary for insertion 
of the protein into the membrane. Consequently, the NH2 terminal is placed extracellularly. 
Consistent with this orientation is the fact that the two adjacent cystein residues at posi-
tions 192 and 193 in the subunit are associated with the extracellular binding site for ACh. 
In addition, the initial extracellular segment constitutes about half of the entire molecule, 
which corresponds to the mass distribution of the intact receptor (see Figure 5.1). Given 
an even number of membrane crossings, the carboxylic acid (COOH) terminal is also 
extracellular. The general features of the model are in agreement with other observations. 
For example, when closely packed, AChRs aggregate in pairs (dimers) formed by disulfide 
cross-links extending between cysteine residues near the COOH terminals of the δ-subunits. 
These cross-links have been shown to be extracellular.14,15

analogous to the muscle receptor α-subunit are identified by the presence of adjacent 
cysteine residues near the proximal end of the amino terminal (positions 192 and 193 
in Figure 5.2). The remaining subunits are designated as β. Together with the α, β, γ, 
δ, and ε-subunits from electroplax and muscle, they form a family of common genetic 
origin.16 To date, 12 subunits have been isolated from chicken and rat nervous system: 
α2–α10 and β2,3,4. Injection into oocytes of mRNA for any one of α2–α6, or α10 
with β2, β3, or β4 results in the formation of heteromultimeric channels. Expression 
of α7, α8, or α9 alone is sufficient for formation of homomultimeric channels. The 
existence of a large family of subunits available for channel formation enables them 
to combine selectively to form a diverse variety of channel isotypes with different

The helix labeled (MA) resides entirely 
within the cytoplasm. The underlined 
cysteine (Cys) residues, at positions 
128 and 142, are linked by a disulphide

A Receptor Superfamily
While the amino-acid sequence and chemical structure of the nAChR were being deter-
mined, it became apparent that other channel-forming receptors were similar in molecular 
composition. We now know that the nAChR is a member of a large superfamily of channel-
forming receptors, known collectively as Cys-loop receptors, so-called because all sub-

Classification of Amino Acids
Channel subunits, like all other peptides, are composed of 
amino acids, and it is the amino acid side chains that deter-
mine many of the local chemical and physical properties of 
the subunits. The twenty amino acids fall into three groups: 
neutral, acidic, and basic as shown (brackets contain three-
letter and one-letter abbreviations). Acidic and basic amino 
acids are hydrophilic. The Neutral amino acids are arranged 
according to hydrophobicity indices (numbers below each 
amino acid) proposed by Kyte and Doolittle,13 starting with the 
most hydrophobic (positive numbers) and progressing to the 
most hydrophilic (negative numbers). Sections of a peptide 
are candidates for membrane-spanning regions if they contain 
sequences of hydrophobic amino acids capable of forming 
an α-helix long enough to traverse the lipid bilayer (about 20 
amino acid residues; see Figure 5.2).

units in the family have a pair of disulphide-bonded cysteines separated by 13 amino acid 
residues (Cys 128 and Cys 141 in Figure 5.2). Other members of the superfamily include 
receptors for serotonin (5-HT3 and MOD-1 receptors), the glycine receptor (GlyR), recep-
tors for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA and the invertebrate EXP-1 receptors), an invertebrate 
glutamate-gated chloride receptor (GluCl), and a receptor activated by ionic zinc (ZAC).17
The 5-HT3 receptors form cation channels with functional properties similar to those of 
nAChR.18 Similarly, the GABA-activated EXP-1 channel19 and the ZAC channel20 are both 
cation selective. EXP-1 is found in invertebrates, and ZAC sequences have been identified 
in human and rat genomes. The remaining members of the family form channels that are 
anion selective. GABAA receptors,21 together with GlyR,22 subserve inhibitory synaptic 
transmission in vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems (see Chapter 11). MOD-1 
channels,23 and GluCl channels24 are found only in invertebrates.
Like the nAChR, each receptor type has a number of subunit isotypes. For example, 16 
different GABAA subunit polypeptides have been identified in vertebrates by recombinant 
DNA techniques: α1–α6, β1–β3, γ1–γ3, δ, ε, π, θ. Three additional ρ = subunits contribute 
to GABAA variants, formerly specified separately as GABAC receptors.21 Five GlyR subunits 
have been identified, four α and one β.22 Two 5HT3 receptor subunits, 5HT3A, and 5HT3B, 
have been described and genes for three additional homologous polypeptides (5HT3C–
5HT3E) have been isolated.25
Receptor Structure and Function
Two techniques have been essential in determining the relations between receptor struc-
ture and function. The first, site-directed mutagenesis, involves the construction of mutant 
cDNAs, with mutations directed at a particular site in the receptor protein, such that se-
lected amino acids with particular properties (e.g., positively or negatively charged, highly 
polar or nonpolar) are replaced by others with different properties. The second technique 
is the expression of mutant receptors in host cells, such as Xenopus oocytes, subsequent to 
injection of the appropriate mRNA. Oocytes normally do not express nAChRs or other 
ligand-activated channels in their membranes. Yet, after the appropriate message has been 
injected, they not only express the protein subunits but also assemble them in the membrane 
to form functionally active channels.26 In such experiments, electrical recording techniques 
are used to measure the characteristics of single-channel currents or whole-cell currents 
(representing the behavior of the entire population of inserted channels). Various muta-
tions were found that affected ligand binding and thereby channel activation, while other 
mutations affected the ion selectivity of the channels and channel conductance. Some of 
the mutations affecting selectivity and conductance were located on the M2 helices, sug-
gesting that these form the lining of the open channel (see Figure 5.5). 
Structure of the Pore Lining 
In order to examine the idea that the M2 helices line the open channel pore, it is useful to 
consider in more detail their amino acid sequences. These are as follows for mouse AChR 
α− and δ−subunits, going from cytoplasm (E 241, see Figure 5.2) to extracellular fluid:

The primed numbering system facilitates comparison between M2 regions of different 
receptor subunits.27 It starts at zero at the predicted cytoplasmic end of the helix and pro-
ceeds toward the extracellular region.
We might expect the relatively hydrophilic amino acids (see Box 5.1), such as the serines 
(S) and threonines (T), to be exposed to the aqueous pore, whereas the more hydrophobic 
isoleucines (I), for example, would be nestled against the membrane lipid or other parts 
of the protein. In accordance with this idea, replacing the serines in the underlined posi-
tions (6ʹ) with alanines (which are weakly hydrophobic) produced a marked reduction in

channel conductance.28 In addition, the binding affinity for the molecule QX222, which 
binds readily to the open channel in the native receptor, was greatly reduced. These effects 
are consistent with the idea that the serine residues are exposed to the aqueous channel. 
Not all of the exposed amino acids are hydrophilic, however. The residues highlighted in 
color in the α-subunit sequence above, which include leucines and valine at positions 9ʹ, 13ʹ 
and 16ʹ, all appear to contribute to the pore lining. These were identified by Karlin and his 
colleagues with a technique known as the substituted-cysteine accessibility method (SCAM), 
in which residues are mutated, one at a time, to cysteine.29 Mutant α-subunits were expressed 
in oocytes together with wild-type β, γ, and δ counterparts. Membrane currents produced by 
ACh were measured before and after exposure of the oocyte to the hydrophilic reagent meth-
anethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA). The reagent reacts selectively with the cysteine 
sulfhydryl group, but it can only do so if the substituted cysteine is at a water-accessible position 
on the subunit (i.e., exposed to the aqueous pore). The reagent attenuated the responses to ACh 
only in channels with α-subunit mutations in the positions indicated. The pattern of exposure 
is consistent with the idea that the identified residues reside along one side of a helical sequence. 
Analogous experiments were done by Changeux and his colleagues on native AChR 
by locating binding sites for chlorpromazine, a molecule that blocks ion flux through the 
channel.30,31 Tritiated chlorpromazine was made to react with amino acid side chains within 
the open channel in response to an intense flash of ultraviolet light (photolabeling). The 
channel subunits were then isolated and scanned for radioactivity. Consistent with the 
substituted cysteine experiments, the radioactive label was present in all four subunits only 
on the M2 segments, and was located at positions 2ʹ, 6ʹ, and 9ʹ.
High-Resolution Imaging of the AChR 
A powerful approach to the question of channel topology is the use of high-resolution 
electron microscopy. Unwin and his colleagues have applied this technique to AChRs from 
Torpedo electric organs.6 Isolated membranes from the electrocytes assemble readily into 
tubular vesicles, with the receptors themselves arrayed in an orderly lattice, as shown in the 
low-power micrographs of Figure 5.4A. Higher magnification images reveal the general 
shape and orientation of the receptor in the membrane (Figure 5.4 B,C). 
By using very large numbers of images and combining digital averaging techniques with 
crystallographic analysis, Unwin and his colleagues were able to describe in detail the structure 
of the receptor at the molecular level, with a resolution of 0.4 nm. The results are summarized 
in Figure 5.5, which shows a view of two of the five subunits, on either side of the central core. 
The extracellular domain of each subunit is built around a sequence of β-strands and 
their associated connecting loops, arranged into outer (red) and inner (blue) sheets. This 
arrangement is closely analogous to the crystal structure of another molecule, acetylcholine-
binding protein (AChBP), described in detail by Brejc and his colleagues.32 AChBP is a soluble 
protein that is secreted by snail glial cells at cholinergic synapses. Like nAChR, it is composed 
of five subunits, and it modulates synaptic transmission by binding ACh in the synaptic cleft.

The transmembrane regions of the subunits are composed of the 
α-helices M1–M4 and are joined to the extracellular domains at the begin-
ning of M1. The M2 helix lies central to the other three so that the five 
M2 segments together form the pore lining. The intracellular portions are 
formed by the sequences between M3 and M4, including the α-helix MA. 
Receptor Activation
In an early series of lower-resolution experiments, Unwin examined the 
structure of the AChR in the presence and absence of ACh.33 The results 
indicated that binding of ACh to the receptor resulted in a rotational dis-
placement in the extracellular domain of the α-subunits. The subsequent 
high-resolution images showed that, in the absence of ACh, α and non-
α-subunits have different conformations. The inner β-sheet in the α-subunit 
is rotated by about 10° with respect to its orientation in the non-α-subunits. 
In the presence of ACh, this difference is absent.34 Unwin concluded that 
ACh binding results in rotation of the inner β-sheet, thereby bringing the 
α-subunit structure into conformation with that of the other subunits. The 
rotational movements of the β-sheets in the two α-subunits are transmitted 
to the M2 helices through interactions between one or more extracellular 
loops and the M2–M3 loops (see Figure 5.5), thereby causing the helices 
to move outward. These movements, together with coordinate outward 
movement of the other three M2 helices, then open the pore.35
This scheme is supported by observations of the X-ray structure (at 2.9 Å resolution) 
of a family of ligand-gated membrane channels in bacteria,36–38 which are analogous in 
structure to mammalian cys-loop receptors and are activated by protons. In the closed 
state the channels are constricted by a ring of hydrophobic side chains in M2, equivalent 
to those at L9ʹ and V13ʹ in the mammalian channel. Upon activation, the constriction is 
removed by outward displacement of the M2 helices (Figure 5.6). 
The M2 peptides, when expressed in lipid bilayers, form channels with selectivity and 
conductances similar to those of native nAChR channels from Torpedo.39 In addition, spon-
taneously occurring channel currents are recorded with mean open times similar to those 
of native channel currents. Thus, it appears that current flow through the open channel is 
regulated by spontaneous fluctuations within the channel structure itself, perhaps in the 
region of the hydrophobic rings or at the more constricted cytoplasmic end of the pore. 
Ion Selectivity and Conductance 
The open channel is narrowest in the 2ʹ region, with a pore diameter of about 0.6 nm in anionic 
channels and 0.8 nm in cationic channels.40 This region is therefore assumed to be critical for 
ion selectivity and conductance. In the nAChR, substituting the threonine at position 2ʹ with 
different residues illustrates the importance of both pore size and polarity. Polar substitutions 
result in higher channel conductance than nonpolar ones, and for both classes, conductance 
decreases with increasing side chain volume of the substituted residue.41,42
One surprising characteristic of the cys-loop receptors is that they include both cation and 
anion-selective channels. The differences in charge selectivity is related to differences in the

FIGURE 5.5 High-Resolution Structure of nAChR Subunits. Schematic 
view of two subunits, flanking the central cavity. The extracellular domain of 
each subunit is built around a sequence of β-strands and their associated con-
necting loops, arranged into outer (red) and inner (blue) sheets. It is connected 
to the first membrane-spanning α-helix, M1. The second α-helix, M2, lies cen-
tral to the other three, so that the complete set of five M2 helices form the pore 
lining. The intracellular domain is formed by the sequence between M3 and M4, 
including the α-helix MA. Ligand binding to the extracellular domain causes re-
orientation of the inner and outer β-strands; this movement is transmitted to the 
pore region by interaction between one or more extracellular loops (1, 2) and 
the M2–M3 loop (3). (After Unwin, 2005.)

sign of the charged residues along the ion pathway.40 If we examine the amino acid sequence 
in the M2 subunits, we find that nAChR (and 5HT3 receptors) have a negatively charged 
residue (E–) at position –1ʹ, just at the cytoplasmic surface and another extracellularly at 
position 20ʹ. Thus, the five M2 helices surround the pore with two distinct negatively charged 
rings that can be expected to promote cation selectivity. In glycine (and GABA) receptors, the 
corresponding residues at positions –1ʹ and 20ʹ are either positive or neutral (A0):

When the M2 residues in neuronal AChR homomultimeric α7 channels are altered to 
mimic those in GlyR channels the channel selectivity is changed from cationic to anionic.43
Conversely, the reverse mutations in the GlyR produce cation-selective channels.44 Charge 
selectivity of GABAC and 5HT3A channels is also reversed by similar mutations.45,46 Thus, 
anionic channels positively charged residues at position –1ʹ, and cationic channels require 
negative residues in the same position.
Apart from determining charge selectivity of the channel, the charged rings have a 
marked effect on channel conductance.47 In the nAChR, reducing the charge on the intra-
cellular ring has the greatest effect, resulting in a reduction in both inward and outward 
current. Charge reduction in the outer ring also reduced conductance with a greater effect 
on inward current. Similar observations have been made on GlyR and GABA channels.45
Other segments of the ion pathway also contribute to ion selectivity and conductance. 
In the cation-selective channels, the walls of the channel vestibules have a net excess of 
negative charges, while in anion-selective channels the excess is positive. The outer vestibule 
is about 2 nm in diameter, and the effective radius for electrostatic interaction in physi-
ological solutions is about 1 nm, so that excess charges in the vestibules might contribute

considerably to accumulation of counter ions, thereby enhancing channel conductance. 
Of particular interest are the intracellular funnels leading laterally from the pore into the 
cytoplasm (see Figure 5.1). Because of their relatively small diameter (< 1 nm), they may 
be expected to play a role in ion permeation. Evidence for such a role has been obtained in 
5-HT3 receptors.48 Homomeric 5-HT3A receptors, which form cationic channels of very low 
conductance (about 1 picosiemens [pS]), have three arginine residues in each MA–M4 loop 
close to M4. Mutations that replace the positively charged arginines with neutral or negative 
residues increase the channel conductance by more than 20-fold. Furthermore, the arginine 
residues are absent in 5HT3B subunits and, accordingly, heteromultimeric 5HT3 channels 
have a much larger conductance (about 16 pS) than the homomeric 5HT3A channels. 
Voltage-Activated Channels
Channels activated specifically by depolarization of the cell membrane include voltage-activated 
sodium channels, responsible for the depolarizing phase of the nerve action potential, and 
voltage-activated potassium channels, associated with membrane repolarization. Also included 
in this group are voltage-activated calcium channels, which in some tissues are responsible for 
action potential generation or prolongation and subserve many other functions, such as muscle 
contraction and release of neurotransmitters. Each of these three families of channels has a 
number of isotypes found in different species and in different parts of the nervous system, and 
like the nAChR and its homologues, they constitute a superfamily of common genetic origin. 
The Voltage-Activated Sodium Channel
The methods that were used to characterizing the molecular structure of the AChR were applied 
with equal success to the voltage-activated sodium channel. The essential steps were biochemical 
extraction and isolation of the protein,49–51 followed by isolation of cDNA clones and deduc-
tion of the amino acid sequence.52 As with the nAChR experiments, an electric fish—this time 
the eel, Electrophorus electricus—provided a rich source of material. and high-affinity toxins, 
principally tetrodotoxin (TTX) and saxitoxin (STX), were available to facilitate isolation of the 
protein. Both of these molecules block ion conduction in the native channels by occluding the 
pore of the open channel. Subsequently, sodium channels were isolated from brain and skeletal 
muscle. The sodium channel purified from eel consists of a single, large (260 kD) protein and 
is representative of a diverse family of structurally similar proteins. 
In mammals, the functional sodium channel consists of the primary 260 kD protein 
(the α-subunit) acting in combination with one or more secondary structures (β-subunits). 
Genes have been identified that encode a family of nine α-subunits (Table 5.1), designated 
Nav1.1–Nav1.9.53 One of the isoforms, Nav1.4, has been found only in skeletal muscle and a 
second, Nav1.5, in denervated skeletal muscle and heart muscle. Of the remainder, Nav1.1–1.3 
are found in the central nervous system; Nav1.6–1.9 are found in the peripheral nervous system. 
Four β-subunits, β1–β4, are expressed in mammalian brain.54,55 These range in size from 33–36 
kD and have been shown to affect the sodium-channel kinetics and voltage dependence.56 
Amino Acid Sequence and Tertiary 
Structure of the Sodium Channel
The eel sodium channel is composed of a sequence of 
1832 amino acids, containing four successive domains 
(I–IV) of 300 to 400 residues, with about a 50% se-
quence homology from one to the next. Each domain is 
architecturally equivalent to one subunit of the nAChR 
family of channel proteins. However, unlike nAChR 
subunits, the sodium channel domains are expressed 
together as a single protein. Within each domain are 
multiple hydrophobic or mixed hydrophobic and hy-
drophilic (amphipathic) sequences capable of forming 
transmembrane helices. As shown in Figure 5.7A, each 
domain has six such membrane-spanning segments,

FIGURE 5.7 Voltage-Activated Channel Structure. (A) Primary (α) subunit of 
the voltage-activated sodium channel is a single protein with four domains (I–IV) 
connected by intracellular and extracellular loops. Each domain has six transmem-
brane segments (S1–S6), with a pore-forming structure (called a P-loop) between 
the fifth and sixth. The primary channel is accompanied by auxiliary (β) subunits.

designated S1–S6. As with the AChR subunits, the domains are arranged radially around 
the pore of the channel. 
Of particular interest is the S4 region, which is highly conserved in all four domains and 
has a positively charged arginine or lysine residue at every third position on the transmem-
brane helix. This feature occurs in all voltage-sensitive channels and provides the coupling 
between voltage changes across the membrane and channel activation.57
After translation, the channel protein is heavily glycosylated. About 30% of the mass 
of the mature eel channel consists of carbohydrate chains containing large amounts of 
sialic acid. In the α-subunits of mammalian sodium channels, glycosylation is more 
variable: Nav1.1–Nav1.4 are 15%–30% glycosylated, Nav1.5 and 1.9 are only about 5% 
carbohydrate.58,59 Also indicated in Figure 5.7A is the structure of the β-subunits. These 
have a large extracellular N-terminal domain with immunoglobulin-like folds, a single 
membrane-spanning region, and a shorter intracellular C-terminal segment. 
Voltage-Activated Calcium Channels
The family of voltage-activated calcium channels is comprised of a number of subtypes 
that have been classified by their functional properties, such as sensitivity to membrane 
depolarization and persistence of activation.60,61 Channel isotypes have been cloned from 
skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, and from brain. These fall into three gene families, 
each with a number of isotypes. The functional and gene classifications are summarized in 
Table 5.2. The amino acid sequence of the primary channel-forming subunit (α1) is similar 
to that of the voltage-activated sodium channel.62 In particular, the putative transmembrane 
regions, S1 to S6, are highly homologous to those of the sodium channel, and the tertiary 
structure is entirely analogous, as indicated in Figure 5.7B.
Although expression of α1-subunits alone is sufficient for formation of functional 
calcium channels in host cells, three accessory subunits are co-expressed in native cell 
membranes: α2–δ, a dimer with the extracellular α2 portion linked to the membrane-
spanning δ portion by a disulfide bridge; β, a membrane protein located intracellularly; 
and γ, an integral membrane protein with four putative transmembrane segments (Figure 
5.7B). Co-expression of various subunit combinations suggest that the α2–δ and β-subunits 
influence both channel conductance and kinetics and that the γ-subunit plays a role in the 
voltage sensitivity of the channel.63,64
Voltage-Activated Potassium Channels
Voltage-sensitive potassium channels play an important role in nerve excitation and conduc-
tion. A number of distinct genetic messages give rise to a diverse family of these proteins. 
The first potassium to be sequenced was the potassium A-channel protein from Drosophila, 
named Shaker for a genetic mutant in which expression of the channel is defective.65 When 
the mutant flies are anesthetized with ether (for example, for counting), they go through a 
period of trembling or shaking before becoming immobile. The mutation itself provided a

different approach to cloning the channel—one that did not rely 
on prior identification of the protein. Genetic analysis indicated 
the approximate location of the Shaker gene on the Drosophila 
genome. Overlapping genomic clones from normal and mutant 
flies were isolated from that region, and comparison of normal 
and mutant sequences led to identification of the Shaker gene. 
An unexpected finding was that the amino acid sequence of 
the protein was very much shorter than that of voltage-sensitive 
sodium or calcium channels. It contained a single domain, similar 
to domain IV of the eel sodium channel. Experimental evidence 
indicates that four of the single protein subunits assemble to 
form multimeric ion channels in the membrane (Figure 5.7C), 
thus mimicking the structure of the voltage-dependent sodium 
and calcium channels.66 
Twelve distinct subfamilies of potassium channel proteins 
have been cloned. The relevant groups are listed in Table 5.3. Each 
subfamily is comprised of a number of isotypes (e.g., Kv11.1, 1.2, 
1.3, etc.) Isotypes from the same subfamily, when expressed in host cells, combine to form 
heteromultimeric channels, but those from different subfamilies do not.67 Like sodium and 
calcium channels, voltage-activated potassium channels are expressed with accessory (β) 
subunits.68 Three subfamilies have been identified: Kvβ1, Kvβ2, and Kvβ3. When expressed 
with the primary subunits, the β-subunits affect the voltage-sensitivity and inactivation 
properties of the channels. 
Pore Formation in Voltage-Activated Channels
A consistent feature of all of the voltage-activated channel sequences is a moderately hydro-
phobic region in the extracellular S5–S6 loop. A segment of the loop contains an amino acid 
sequence that is highly conserved across all members of the potassium channel family (called 
the K+ channel signature sequence).69,70 As in the experiments described previously for the 
M2 region of the nAChR, mutations to this region of the Shaker potassium channel reduced 
the binding affinity for the blocking molecule tetraethylammonium (TEA) and altered the 
conductance properties of the channel.71,72 It was concluded that this segment dips into the 
channel mouth to form the upper part of the pore region—a conclusion that is confirmed 
later by X-ray diffraction (Figure 5.8). S5–S6 is now known as the P-loop (P for “pore”). 
When the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) was used to identify 
residues exposed to the pore lining, the residues were found not only on the P-loop

the P-loop and the cytoplasm.73,74 
High-Resolution Imaging of the Potassium Channel
The structure of potassium channels from Streptomyces lividans (KCSA channels) has been 
examined with X-ray crystallography at a resolution at 5.2 Å.75 These bacterial channels 
belong to a class of potassium channels that are only weakly voltage sensitive and whose 
subunits have only two transmembrane segments, rather than six. The two segments, M1 
and M2, are structurally equivalent to S5 and S6 in the voltage-activated channels, and the 
M1–M2 link represents the P-loop. The KCSA channel is a tetramer. Figure 5.8 is a sectional 
view of the channel, showing its major structural features. Near the amino terminus of 
each subunit is an outer helix (m1) that spans the membrane from the cytoplasmic side of 
the membrane to the outer surface. The outer helix is followed by a short helix that points 
into the pore and then by an inner helix (m2) that returns to the cytoplasmic side. The links 
between the outer and short helices form four turrets that surround the external open-
ing of the pore and contain the binding sites for TEA and channel-blocking toxins. The 
link between the central end of the short helix and the inner helix contributes to the pore 
structure. These four inner links combine to form a restricted passage responsible for the 
ion selectivity of the channel—the selectivity filter. A relatively large central cavity and a 
smaller internal pore connect the selectivity filter with the cytoplasm. 
The crystal structure of the complete Shaker voltage-dependent potassium channel is 
known as well.76 The arrangement of the α-subunit is shown schematically in Figure 5.9A. 
The molecule has two distinct regions—the voltage-sensing region, consisting of S1–S4, 
and the pore-forming region formed by S5–S6. 
Figure 5.9B shows a schematic view of the complete channel. The four S5–S6 helices 
of the α-subunits interlace to form a box-like structure around the pore. As in the KCSA 
channel, the S6 helices line the pore, and the S5–S6 linker dips into the extracellular opening 
to form the selectivity filter. The voltage-sensing regions sit somewhat apart at the four 
corners of the central structure. 
Selectivity and Conductance
Selectivity for potassium is achieved by both the size and molecular composition of the 
selectivity filter,77 which, in the KCSA channel, has a diameter of about 0.3 nm. The amino 
acids in its wall are oriented so that successive rings of four carbonyl oxygen atoms, one 
from each subunit, are exposed to the pore. The pore diameter is adequate to accommodate 
a dehydrated potassium ion (about 0.27 nm in diameter) but stripping waters of hydration 
from the penetrating ion requires considerable energy (see Chapter 4). This requirement is 
minimized by the exposed oxygens, which provide effective substitutes for the oxygen atoms 
that normally surround the hydrated molecule. Smaller ions, such as sodium (diameter 
0.19 nm) or lithium (0.12 nm) are excluded because they cannot make intimate contact 
with all four oxygens simultaneously, and so remain hydrated. Ions larger than cesium (0.33 
nm diameter) cannot penetrate the pore because of their size. This structural basis for ion 
selectivity is in accordance with traditional ideas about ion permeation through channels.78
Other regions of the potassium channel contribute to its conductance properties. For 
example, in the KCSA channel, replacing a neutral alanine residue by glutamate near the 
cytoplasmic end of M2, so as to form a ring of negative charges near the channel mouth 
results in a significant increase in conductance.74 Similarly, in Kv2.1 channels, conductance 
is increased by replacing a ring of positively charged lysines in the outer vestibule with 
neutral residues.79 
In sodium and calcium channels, both selectivity and conductance are altered by muta-
tions in the P-loop. For example, mutations in the P-loops at corresponding positions on 
each of the four domains can result in sodium channels acquiring the characteristics of 
calcium channels.80 One prominent characteristic of the calcium channel is a ring of four 
negative charges around the pore, formed by glutamate residues in the loops. In sodium 
channels, the four corresponding residues (D –, E –, K+, A) form a ring with a net charge 
of –1. Replacement of the alanine and lycine residues with glutamate results in increased

calcium permeability and block by calcium of permeation by sodium ions. Conversely, in 
calcium channels, the reverse mutations at the same positions reduced calcium permeability 
and allowed permeation of monovalent cations.81
Gating of Voltage-Activated Channels
Structural studies suggest that closed channels are occluded by the S6 segments coming 
together near the cytoplasmic end of the pore. This idea is supported by SCAM experi-
ments in Shaker potassium channels. Probes presented to the cytoplasmic end of closed 
channels were able to penetrate only a very short distance.71
For voltage-activated gating to occur, there must be charged elements within the chan-
nel protein that are displaced by membrane depolarization. The S4 helix is an obvious 
candidate. As previously noted, it contains a string of positively charged lysine or arginine 
residues, located at every third position, and this feature is highly conserved within the 
superfamily of voltage-activated channels. These features suggest that the S4 helices 
comprise the voltage-sensing elements that link changes in membrane potential to the 
gating mechanism.82 Application of a positive potential to the inside of the cell membrane 
(depolarization) would displace the positive charges so as to cause movement of the helix. 
Several techniques have provided support for the idea that activation is accompanied by

translation of charges in the S4 segments between intracellular and extracellular spaces.83
For example, in cysteine accessibility experiments, residues at either end of the S4 helix were 
mutated to cysteine and accessibility of cysteine sulfhydryl groups to hydrophilic reagents 
tested.84,85 Residues inaccessible from outside the cell at rest became accessible when the 
membrane was depolarized. Similarly, residues accessible from the inside at rest became 
inaccessible upon depolarization.
The nature of the S4 helix displacement will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7. 
In any event, movements of the charged S4 segments are in some way transmitted to the 
S6 helices in each of the four domains, thereby opening a conducting pathway from the 
channel pore to the cytoplasm.86 The structural arrangement of the Shaker channel (see 
Figure 5.3) suggests that S4–S6 coupling is through interactions between the S4–S5 linker 
and the cytoplasmic end of S6. 
A variety of evidence has accumulated showing that gating of channel currents can 
occur quite independently of the S4 coupled gating mechanism.87 For example, when the 
voltage-activated gate in Shaker Kv channels is disabled by charge-neutralizing mutations in 
S4, the channel continues to pass current pulses with kinetics indistinguishable from those 
in the wild-type channel.88 Other experiments suggest that current switching in P-loop 
channels may involve the selectivity filter. Mutations in that region of the Kv channel have 
been shown to affect not only the channel conductance (as expected) but also the kinetics 
of the rapid gating transitions.89 Similarly, mutations within the selectivity filter of inward 
rectifier channels (Kir; see Table 5.3), which are constitutively active unless blocked by mag-
nesium at their cytoplasmic end, alter their gating properties.90,91 In addition, accessibility 
studies on open and closed SK and CNG channels, which are ligand-activated (see Table 
5.3), suggest the presence of a gate in the same region.92,93 These kinds of observations 
suggest the possibility of a dual gating system, with the voltage-coupled gating mechanism 
providing access to the channel and ionic currents though the open channel being switched 
on and off by fluctuations in the region of the selectivity filter.
Following activation, many voltage-sensitive channels then inactivate. That is, they enter 
a state that no longer allows the passage of ions through the pore. The principle mechanism 
of inactivation involves cytoplasmic residues moving into the mouth of the pore, thereby 
blocking access to the channel. This mechanism will be discussed in detail in Chapter 7. 
Other Channels
There is a large number of other channels important for neuronal function, with a wide 
variety of structural configurations. Some are assembled from subunits that have as few 
as two transmembrane helices each. Others are formed by a single, large molecule. Some 
of these are catalogued in Table 5.4. An extensive list of channel subunits, their official 
names, and human and animal gene designations, can be found at the web site of The 
Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology: 
http://www.iuphar-db.org. 
Glutamate Receptors
Glutamate is the most important and prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter in the central 
nervous system, activating three cation channel types (see Chapter 14). The three types 
have distinct functional properties and are distinguished experimentally by their different 
sensitivities to glutamate analogues.94 One responds selectively to N-methyl-D-aspartate 
(NMDA). The other two are activated selectively by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole 
propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate. Because of this selectivity, the three chemical analogues 
are important experimental tools. Remember, however, that the native neurotransmitter 
for all three receptor types is glutamate, not one of the analogues.
So far, 16 cDNAs for glutamate receptor subunits have been identified by molecular 
cloning.95 Seven of these—GluN1, GluN2A through 2D, and GluN3A and B—are involved 
in the formation of NMDA receptors. AMPA receptors are formed from another set, 
designated as GluA1–GluA4, and kainate receptors are assembled from subunits GluK1–3 
combined with GluK4 or 5. Two homologous subunits, δ1 and δ2, remain unassigned to 
any particular receptor. The subunit proteins have four putative transmembrane seg-

ments. However, the second segment, rather than crossing the membrane, enters from the 
cytoplasmic face to form a hairpin loop contributing to the pore lining.96 The subunits are 
believed to be phylogenetically related to the potassium channel family, and their structure 
resembles that of an upside-down KCSA potassium channel subunit, with an additional 
transmembrane segment (Figure 5.10B).97 Unlike nAChR subunits, their C-terminus

is intracellular. Both the N-terminus and the M3–M4 loop contribute to the ligand binding 
sites. The complete receptor is a tetramer. 
ATP-Activated Channels
Adenosine-5ʹ-triphosphate (ATP) acts as a neurotransmitter in smooth muscle cells, in 
autonomic ganglion cells, and in neurons of the central nervous system (see Chapter 14). 
Because ATP is a purine, its receptor molecules are known as purinergic (P) receptors. P2X 
receptors form ligand-gated cation channels that subserve a wide variety of functions.98
P2Y receptors activate intracellular messenger systems. Seven P2X subunits (P2X1–P2X7) 
have been cloned.99 Their proposed tertiary structure, with two membrane-spanning seg-
ments, is similar to that of the KCSA subunits, and subunits of inward-rectifier channels 
(Figure 5.10A).
Channels Activated by Cyclic Nucleotides
Receptors in the retina and olfactory epithelium are activated by intracellular cyclic AMP 
or cyclic GMP. The receptors form cation channels, with varying selectivities for potas-
sium, sodium, or calcium. They are similar in structure to voltage-sensitive cation chan-
nels, being composed of four subunits, each with six membrane-spanning regions and 
a P-loop between S5 and S6.100,101 The S4 helix contains a sequence of charged residues, 
but these are fewer in number than found in the voltage-sensitive family (usually four 
rather than six or seven). Consistent with its activation by intracellular ligands, most 
of the mass of the channel is on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In vertebrates, 
six members of the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) gene family have been identified. 
CNGA1 and CNGB1 (later designated CNGB1a) were first found in bovine rod pho-
toreceptors. Three CNGA1 subunits combine with one CNGB1 to form the native rod 
channel. In cones, CNG channels composed of two other subunits, designated CNGA3 
and CNGB3, in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:2. Yet another pair of subunits, CNGA2 and 
CNGA4, is found in olfactory neurons. These combine with an alternatively spliced 
variant of CNGB1 (CNGB1b) to form the olfactory receptor channel, with stoichiom-
etry (A2)2(A4)(B1b).
Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels 
Calcium-activated potassium channels are activated by local changes in cytoplasmic cal-
cium and are divided into three categories according to their potassium conductance: big 
(BK), small (SK), and intermediate (IK).102,103 BK channels are also voltage sensitive and 
are activated by the concerted action of membrane depolarization and increased intracel-
lular calcium. Their conductance is over 100 pS. SK channels are voltage-insensitive and 
have conductances of 10 pS or less. The IK channel conductance is in the order of 50 pS. 
Structurally, SK and IK channel subunits share their overall transmembrane topology 
with voltage-activated potassium channels, but the only notable homology in amino acid 
sequence is in the P-loop. BK channel subunits are similar in topology but have seven, rather 
than six, membrane crossings, with the additional transmembrane segment (S0) carrying 
the amino terminus into the extracellular domain. 
Voltage-Sensitive Chloride Channels
Voltage-sensitive chloride channels (CLC) have the interesting property that each channel 
molecule contains two independent pores that are gated together.104 The molecule con-
sists of two identical subunits, each of which is composed of 18 α-helices and forms its 
own independent channel.105 CLC-0 was first cloned from the electric organ of Torpedo. 
The channel is found in high density on the noninnervated face of the cells and provides a 
low-resistance pathway for currents generated by electrical activity of the innervated face. 
It belongs to a large family that includes at least nine mammalian homologues. CLC-0 is 
found in mammalian brain. CLC-1 channels in mammalian skeletal muscle fibers are major 
contributors to the resting membrane conductance and serve to stabilize the membrane

potential at its resting level. CLC-2 appears to be associated with cell volume regulation 
and therefore may be stretch-sensitive. Two other isotypes, CLC-K1 and CLC-K2, are as-
sociated with chloride reabsorption in the kidney. Other branches of the family, CLC-3 to 
CLC-7, are predominantly found in membranes of intracellular vesicles. 
Inward-Rectifying Potassium Channels
Inward-rectifying potassium channels (Kir channels) allow the movement of potassium 
ions into cells when the membrane potential is negative with respect to the potassium 
equilibrium potential, but allow little outward potassium movement when the driving 
force is in the opposite direction. The absence of outward potassium flux is associated with 
blockade of the channels by intracellular magnesium and/or by intracellular polyamines.106
The channel is a tetramer with each subunit having only two membrane-spanning helices, 
similar to the KCSA channel (see Figure 5.10A). Seven subfamilies of the channel (Kir1–
Kir7) have been cloned from brain, heart, and kidney.107 The channels display a variety of 
functional properties. One family, Kir3, forms channels that are activated by intracellular 
G proteins (see Chapter 12). 
2P Channels 
The family of 2P potassium channels is so called because each subunit contains two pore-
forming loops.108 The subunit has four transmembrane regions, M1–M4, with pore-forming 
loops M1–M2 and M3–M4 (Figure 5.10C). Two subunits assemble in the membrane to 
form the channel. 2P channels are open at normal cell resting potentials and are a major 
contributor to the resting potassium conductance, or “leak” pathways across cell membranes. 
The first 2P channel was cloned from Drosophila, and since then 16 additional mammalian 
subunits have been described.
Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) Channels
Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels constitute a very large family of cation-selective 
channels that are formed in the membrane by the assembly of four subunits. The first to 
be identified and cloned is associated with visual transduction in Drosophila. Photorecep-
tors in mutants lacking the trp gene are unable to maintain a sustained response to light. 
Instead, the receptor potential adapts rapidly (i.e., becomes transient). Since then, more 
than 50 TRP subunit genes have been identified, at least 28 of them in mammals.109,110 The 
subunits are characterized by six transmembrane segments with a pore loop between the 
fifth and sixth segment, with extended cytoplasmic N- and C-terminal regions. Although 
the subunits lack charged residues in S4, some of the channels are voltage sensitive. The 
channels are generally non-selective, but their calcium permeability varies over a wide 
range. The mammalian TRP superfamily is divided into six groups (see Table 5.4), each 
with its own set of functional characteristics, which vary widely from one group to the next. 
Some channels respond to light, others to odorants, changes in osmolarity, or changes in 
temperature. For example, the TRPV family is involved in heat detection and TRPM8 in 
the detection of cold (see Chapter 19).
Diversity of Subunits
A feature of channel structure is the remarkably wide diversity of subunit isotypes. Thus, 
there are more than a dozen nAChR subunits and an even greater number of potassium 
channel and glutamate receptor subunits. How does this diversity arise? Generally, each 
channel or channel subunit is encoded by a separate gene, but two additional mechanisms 
have been identified. The first is called alternative splicing. Most proteins are encoded in 
several different segments of DNA known as exons. In some cases, instead of combining 
uniquely to form mRNA for a specific subunit, transcripts of the exons instead enter into 
various alternative combinations to generate mRNA for a variety of subunit isotypes. Dur-
ing transcription, an unknown regulatory mechanism determines which of the alternative 
RNAs are to be used. The remaining RNAs are excised from the transcript and the desired

RNA segments spliced together to form the final mRNA. Shaker potassium channel iso-
types are generated in this way. 
The third method of obtaining subunit diversity is by RNA editing. Examples include 
the glutamate receptor subunits GluA2, GluK3, and GluK4 (formerly known as GluR2, 
GluR5, and GluR6). These carry either a glutamine or arginine residue within the pore. 
The presence of the arginine residue severely depresses the calcium permeability of the 
channel and alters its ionic conductance properties. It turns out that the genomic DNA 
for all three subunits harbors a glutamine codon (CAG) for that position, even though 
an arginine codon (CGG) can be found in the mRNAs.111 The change in base sequence is 
accomplished by RNA editing in the cell nucleus. Virtually the entire message for GluA2 
is edited in this way as well as some of the message for GluK3 and GluK4. In GluK4, ad-
ditional A-G editing is found in a different region of the pore.112 RNA editing at a single 
site in the glycine receptor subunit GlyRα3 has been shown to underlie a marked increase 
in glycine sensitivity.113
Conclusion
The techniques used to examine the functional characteristics and structural details of the 
Cys-loop receptors on the one hand, and the voltage-activated cation channels on the other, 
have led to a remarkable increase in our detailed knowledge of channel structure and func-
tion. The two channel types, although appearing to be quite different at first glance, have a 
similar functional organization. Both are composed of three essential parts: a signal-sensing 
domain, a transmembrane pore-forming domain, and a cytoplasmic domain. 
In Cys-loop receptors, the sensing domain is the ligand-binding region of the molecule, 
located appropriately in the extracellular space. The ligand-binding region is connected to 
M1 and, when activated, interacts with the connecting loop between M1 and M2 to shift M2 
outward, thereby opening the pore. By necessity, voltage-activated channels have their sensing 
region in the membrane itself, with the S4 helix being the essential sensing element. Their 
activation is entirely equivalent to that of the Cys-loop receptors: the voltage sensor is connected 
to S5 and, upon depolarization, interacts with the S5–S6 loop to move S6 out of the pore. 
The cytoplasmic region of the channels has a variety of functions. In the Cys-loop 
receptors and voltage-activated channels, the region plays a role in ion selectivity, and 
in voltage-activated channels, it plays a major role in inactivation. In addition, channels 
activated by intracellular ligands have cytoplasmic ligand-binding sites that are coupled 
with the transmembrane region so as to open the channel pore during activation. 
As a general rule, channels that are relatively selective, such as the voltage-activated 
channels, are usually tetramers (one exception is the dimeric 2P channel); larger, less selective 
ligand-activated channels are pentamers. As an extension of this principle, the very largest 
and least selective channels—the gap junctions—have a hexameric structure (see Chapter 8).
The techniques now at hand will enable us to build on these general principles and 
provide even more intimate details of how the molecular organization of a given channel 
affects its functional properties, and hence, its role in nervous system function.

SUMMARY
 
■
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) from the 
electric organ of Torpedo consist of five subunits (two 
α and three others designated β, γ, and δ) arranged 
around a central pore. 
 
■
In each subunit of the AChR the string of amino acids 
folds to form four membrane-spanning helices (M1–
M4) joined by intracellular and extracellular loops. The 
extracellular loops in the α-subunits contain the binding 
sites for ACh. The M2 helices form the central pore of 
the channel.
 
■
Binding of ACh to the two α-subunits results in a 
change in configuration that is transmitted to the M2 
helices, which move radially outward to widen the pore 
and allow ion flux through the channel.
 
■
AChRs belong to a superfamily of Cys-loop receptors 
that includes receptors for γ-amino butyric acid (GABA), 
glycine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). 
 
■
The voltage-activated sodium channel from eel electric 
organs is a single molecule of about 1800 amino acids 
within which are four repeating domains (I–IV). The 
domains are arranged around the central pore and 
are architecturally equivalent to the subunits of other 
channels. Within each domain are six membrane-
spanning helices (S1–S6) connected by intracellular 
and extracellular loops. The primary (α) subunits of 
mammalian sodium channels are homologous with 
the eel channel but are expressed in the membrane in 
concert with auxiliary (β) subunits.
 
■
The family of voltage-activated calcium channel 
proteins is analogous in structure to the voltage-
activated sodium channel. Voltage-activated 
potassium channels are structurally similar but with 
an important genetic difference—the four repeating 
units are expressed as individual subunits, not as 
repeating domains of a single molecule. Together, the 
three voltage-activated channels constitute a genetic 
superfamily.
 
■
The voltage-activated sodium, calcium, and potassium 
channels are known as P-loop channels because of 
a loop of amino acids that enters the membrane from 
the extracellular side between S5 and S6 in each of the 
four domains. The P-loops form the outer part of the 
pore lining and play a major role in the ion selectivity 
of the channel. The remainder of the pore is lined by 
cytoplasmic ends of the S6 helices. 
 
■
Depolarization of the membrane displaces the S4 
helices (that have a number of positively charged 
residues), which in turn, produces an outward radial 
movement of the S6 helices to open the pore. 
 
■
Inactivation of voltage-activated channels occurs 
when one of the intracellular loops of the amino acid 
swings into the cytoplasmic mouth of the open channel, 
thereby preventing ion flux through the pore. 
 
■
The techniques used to determine the detailed 
structure of these two ion channel families have led 
to a widespread understanding of the molecular 
organization of a number of other channel types. 


■ CHAPTER 6
Ionic Basis of the 
Resting Potential
t rest, a neuron has a steady electrical potential across its plasma membrane, the inside 
    being negative with respect to the outside. In the neuron, the intracellular potassium 
     concentration is high compared to that in the extracellular fluid, whereas the intracellular 
concentrations of sodium and chloride are low. As a result, potassium tends to diffuse out of the 
cell and sodium and chloride tend to diffuse in. The tendency for potassium ions to move out of 
the cell and chloride ions to move in is opposed by the membrane potential.
In this chapter, we discuss the relations between concentration and potential, first for a model 
cell whose membrane is permeable only to potassium and chloride. In this cell, the concentration 
gradients and the membrane potential can be balanced exactly, so that there is no net flux of either 
ion across the membrane. The membrane potential is then equal to the equilibrium potential for 
both potassium and chloride. In the model cell, changing the extracellular potassium concentra-
tion changes the potassium equilibrium potential, and hence the membrane potential. In contrast, 
changing extracellular chloride concentration eventually leads to an equivalent change in intracellular 
chloride so that the chloride equilibrium potential and the membrane potential are unchanged. 
 Real cells are also permeable to sodium. At rest, sodium ions constantly move into the cell, 
reducing the internal negativity of the membrane. As a result, potassium, being no longer in 
equilibrium, leaks out. If there were no compensation, these fluxes would lead to changes in the 
internal concentrations of sodium and potassium. However, the concentrations are maintained by 
the sodium–potassium exchange pump, which transports sodium out and potassium in across the 
cell membrane in a ratio of 3 parts sodium to 2 parts potassium. The resting membrane poten-
tial depends on the potassium equilibrium potential, the sodium equilibrium potential, the relative 
permeability of the cell membrane to the two ions, and the pump ratio. At the resting potential, the 
passive fluxes of sodium and potassium are exactly matched by the rates at which they are trans-
ported in the opposite direction. Because the sodium–potassium exchange pump transports more 
positive ions outward than inward across the membrane, it makes a direct contribution of several 
millivolts to the membrane potential. 
The chloride equilibrium potential may be positive or negative relative to the resting membrane 
potential, depending on the chloride transport processes. Although the chloride distribution plays 
little role in determining the resting membrane potential, substantial chloride permeability is impor-
tant in some cells for electrical stability.
A

100 Chapter 6
Electrical signals are generated in nerve cells and muscle fibers 
primarily by changes in permeability of the cell membrane to 
ions such as sodium and potassium. Increases in permeability 
allow ions to move inward or outward across the cell membrane 
down their electrochemical gradients. As we discuss in Chapter 
4, permeability increases are due to activation of ion channels. 
Ions moving through the open channels change the charge on 
the cell membrane, and hence, change the membrane potential. 
In order to understand how signals are generated, it is neces-
sary first to understand how the standing ionic gradients across 
the cell membrane determine the resting membrane potential. 
A Model Cell
It is useful to begin with the idealized model cell shown in Figure 
6.1. This cell contains potassium, sodium, chloride, and a large 
anion species, and it is bathed in a solution of sodium and po-
tassium chloride. Other ions present in real cells (e.g., calcium 
or magnesium) are ignored for the moment, as their direct con-
tributions to the resting membrane potential are negligible. The 
extracellular and intracellular ion concentrations in the model 
cell are similar to those found in frogs. In birds and mammals, 
ion concentrations are somewhat higher, while in marine inver-
tebrates (e.g., squid) they are very much higher (Table 6.1). The 
model cell membrane is permeable to potassium and chloride, but not to sodium or to the 
internal anion. There are three major requirements for a cell to remain in a stable condition: 
1. The intracellular and extracellular solutions must each be electrically neutral. For example, 
a solution of chloride ions alone cannot exist; their negative charges must be balanced by 
an equal number of positive charges on cations such as sodium or potassium (otherwise 
electrical repulsion would literally blow the solution apart). 
2. The cell must be in osmotic balance. Otherwise, water will enter or leave the cell, causing 
it to swell or shrink. Osmotic balance is achieved when the total concentration of solute 
particles inside the cell is equal to that on the outside. 
3. There must be no net movement of any particular ion into or out of the cell. 
Ionic Equilibrium
How are the concentrations of the permeant ions maintained in the model cell, and what 
electrical potential is developed across the cell membrane? Figure 6.1 shows that the two 
ions are distributed in reverse ratio—potassium is more concentrated on the inside of 
the cell, chloride on the outside. Imagine first that the membrane 
is permeable only to potassium. The question that arises immedi-
ately is why potassium ions do not diffuse out of the cell until the 
concentrations on either side of the cell membrane are equal. The 
answer is that the process is self-limiting. As the potassium ions dif-
fuse outward, positive charges accumulate on the outer surface of the 
membrane and excess negative charges are left on the inner surface. 
As a result, an electrical potential develops across the membrane, with 
the inside being negative with respect to the outside. The electrical 
gradient slows the efflux of positively charged potassium ions, and 
when the potential becomes sufficiently large, further net efflux of 
potassium is stopped. The potential at which this occurs is called the 
potassium equilibrium potential (EK). At EK, the effects of the con-
centration gradient and the potential gradient on ion flux through 
the membrane balance one another exactly. Individual potassium 
ions still enter and leave the cell, but no net movement occurs. The 
potassium ion is in equilibrium.

FIGURE 6.1 Ion Distributions in a Model Cell. The cell membrane 
is impermeable to Na+ and the internal anion (A–) and permeable to K+ 
and Cl– . The concentration gradient for K+ tends to drive it out of the 
cell (black arrow), while the potential gradient tends to attract K+ into 
the cell (red arrow). In a cell at rest, the two forces are exactly in bal-
ance. Concentration and electrical gradients for Cl– are in the reverse 
directions. Ion concentrations are expressed in millimolar (mM).

The conditions for potassium to be in equilibrium across the cell membrane are the 
same as those described in Chapter 4 for maintaining zero net flux through an individual 
channel in a membrane patch. There, a concentration gradient was balanced by a potential 
applied to the patch pipette. The important difference here is that the ion flux itself produces 
the required transmembrane potential. In other words, equilibrium in the model cell is 
automatic and inevitable. Recall from Chapter 4 that the potassium equilibrium potential 
is given by the Nernst equation:

where [K]o and [K]i are the internal and external potassium ion concentrations. For the 
cell shown in Figure 6.1, EK is 58 log (1/30) = –85 mV. Suppose now that, in addition to 
potassium channels, the membrane has chloride channels. Because for an anion z = –1,

In our model cell, the chloride concentration ratio is again 1/30 and ECl is also –85 mV. 
As with potassium, the membrane potential of –85 mV balances exactly the tendency for 
chloride to move down its concentration gradient, in this case into the cell. 
In summary, both the tendency for potassium ions to leave the cell and for chloride 
ions to diffuse inward are opposed by the membrane potential. Because the concentration 
ratios for the two ions are of exactly the same magnitude (1:30), their equilibrium potentials 
are exactly the same. As potassium and chloride are the only two ions that can move across 
the membrane and both are in equilibrium at –85 mV, the model cell can exist indefinitely 
without any net gain or loss of ions. 
Electrical Neutrality
The charge separation across the membrane of our model cell means that there is an excess 
of anions inside the cell and of cations outside. This appears to violate the principle of electri-
cal neutrality but, in fact, does not. Potassium ions diffusing outward collect as excess cations 
against the outer membrane surface, leaving excess anions closely attracted to the inner surface. 
Both the potassium ions and the counter ions they leave behind are, in effect, removed from 
the intracellular bulk solution, leaving it neutral. Similarly, chloride ions diffusing inward add 
to the collection of excess anions on the inner surface of the membrane and leave counterions 
in the outer charged layer, so that the extracellular solution remains neutral as well. The outer 
layer of cations and inner layer of anions, of equal and opposite charges, are not in free solu-
tion but are held to the membrane surface by mutual attraction. Thus, the membrane acts as 
a capacitor, separating and storing charge. This does not mean that any given anion or cation 
is locked in position against the membrane. Ions in the charged layer interchange freely with 
those in the bulk solution. The point is that although the identities of the ions in the layer are 
constantly changing, their total number remains constant, and the bulk solution stays neutral. 
Another question we might ask about charge separation is whether or not the num-
ber of ions accumulated in the charged layer represents a significant fraction of the total 
number of ions in the cell. The answer is that it does not. If we consider our model cell to 
have a radius of 25 μm, then at a concentration of 120 millimolar (mM), there are roughly
4 × 1012 cations and an equal number of anions in the cytoplasm. At a membrane potential 
of –85 mV the amount of charge separated by the membrane is about 5 × 1011 univalent 
ions/cm2 (see Chapter 8). Our cell has a surface area of about 8 × 10–5 cm2, so there are 
approximately 4 × 107 negative ions collected at the inner surface of the membrane, which 
is 1/100,000 the number in free solution. Thus, the movements of potassium and chloride 
ions into the charged layer as they establish the membrane potential have no significant 
effect on intracellular free ion concentrations. 

102 Chapter 6
The Effect of Extracellular Potassium and Chloride 
on Membrane Potential
In neurons and in many other cells, the steady-state resting membrane potential is sensitive 
to changes in extracellular potassium concentration but is relatively unaffected by changes 
in extracellular chloride. To understand how this comes about, it is useful to consider the 
consequences of such changes in the model cell. We will assume throughout this discussion 
that the volume of the extracellular fluid is infinitely large relative to the volume of the cell. 
Thus, movements of ions and water into or out of the cell have no significant effect on ex-
tracellular concentrations. Figure 6.2A shows the changes in intracellular composition and 
membrane potential that result from increasing extracellular potassium from 3 mM to 6 
mM. The extracellular sodium concentration is reduced by 3 mM to keep the osmolarity 
unchanged. The increase in extracellular potassium reduces the concentration gradient for 
outward potassium movement, while initially leaving the electrical gradient unchanged. As a 
result, there will be a net inward movement of potassium ions. As positive charges accumulate 
on its inner surface, the membrane is depolarized. This in turn means that chloride ions are 
no longer in equilibrium and they move into the cell as well. Potassium and chloride entry 
continues until a new equilibrium is established, and both ions are at a new concentration 
ratio consistent with the new membrane potential—in this example –68 mV.

Potassium and chloride entry is accompanied by entry of water to maintain osmotic 
balance, resulting in a slight increase in cell volume. When the new equilibrium is reached, 
intracellular potassium has increased in concentration from 90 mM to 91 mM, intracellular 
chloride from 4 mM to 7.9 mM, and the cell volume has increased by 3.5%. 
At first glance it seems that more chloride than potassium has entered the cell, but think 
what the concentrations would be if the cell did not increase in volume: the concentrations 
of both ions would be greater than the indicated values by 3.5%. Thus, the intracellular 
chloride concentration would be about 8.2 mM (instead of 7.9 mM after the entry of water), 
and intracellular potassium would be about 94.2 mM, both being 4.2 mM higher than in the 
original solution. In other words, we can think first of potassium and chloride entering in equal 
quantities (except for the trivial difference required to change the charge on the membrane) 
and then of water following to achieve the final concentrations shown in the figure. 
Similar considerations apply to changes in extracellular chloride concentration, but with 
a marked difference: when the new steady state is finally reached the membrane potential 
is essentially unchanged. The consequences of a 50% reduction in extracellular chloride 
concentration are shown in Figure 6.2B, in which 60 mM of chloride in the solution bath-
ing the cell is replaced by an impermeant anion. Chloride leaves the cell, depolarizing the 
membrane toward the new chloride equilibrium potential (–68 mV). Potassium, no longer 
being in equilibrium, leaves as well. As in the previous example, potassium and chloride 
leave the cell in equal quantities (accompanied by water). Because the intracellular concen-
tration of potassium is high, the fractional change in concentration produced by the efflux 
is relatively small. However, the efflux of chloride causes a sizable fractional change in the 
intracellular chloride concentration, and hence in the chloride equilibrium potential. As 
chloride continues to leave the cell the equilibrium potential returns toward its original 
value. The process continues until the chloride and potassium equilibrium potentials are 
again equal and the membrane potential is restored. 
Membrane Potentials in Squid Axons
The idea that the resting membrane potential is the result of an unequal distribution of 
potassium ions between the extracellular and intracellular fluids was first proposed by Ju-
lius Bernstein1 in 1902. He could not test this hypothesis directly, however, because there 
was no satisfactory way of measuring membrane potential. It is now possible to measure 
membrane potential accurately and to see whether changes in external and internal potas-
sium concentrations produce the potential changes predicted by the Nernst relation. The 
first such experiments were done on giant axons that innervate the mantle of the squid. The 
axons are up to 1 mm in diameter,2 and their large size permits the insertion of recording 
electrodes into their cytoplasm to measure transmembrane potential directly (Figure 6.3A). 
Further, they are remarkably resilient and continue to function even when their axoplasm 
has been squeezed out with a rubber roller and replaced with an internal perfusate (Fig-
ure 6.3B)! Thus their internal, as well as external ion composition can be controlled. A. L. 
Hodgkin, who together with A. F. Huxley initiated many experiments on squid axon (for 
which they later received the Nobel prize), has said:
It is arguable that the introduction of the squid giant nerve fiber by J. Z. Young in 
1936 did more for axonology than any other single advance during the last forty 
years. Indeed a distinguished neurophysiologist remarked recently at a congress din-
ner (not, I thought, with the utmost tact), “It’s the squid that really ought to be given 
the Nobel Prize.” 3
The concentrations of some of the major ions in squid blood and in the axoplasm of the 
squid nerves are given in Table 6.1 (several ions, including magnesium and internal anions, 
are omitted). Experiments on isolated axons are usually done in seawater, with the ratio 
of intracellular to extracellular potassium concentrations being 40:1. In these conditions, 
the membrane potential is –65 to –70 mV, considerably less negative than the potassium 
equilibrium potential of –93 mV, but more negative than the chloride equilibrium potential, 
which is about – 55 mV. 
Bernstein’s hypothesis was tested by measuring the resting membrane potential and 
comparing it with the potassium equilibrium potential at various extracellular potassium 

104 Chapter 6
concentrations. As with our model cell, these changes would not be expected to produce a 
significant change in internal potassium concentration. From the Nernst equation, changing 
the concentration ratio by a factor of 10 should change the membrane potential by 58 mV 
at room temperature. The results of an experiment on squid axon, in which the external 
potassium concentration was changed are shown in Figure 6.4. The external concentration 
is plotted on a logarithmic scale on the abscissa and the membrane potential on the ordinate. 
The expected slope of 58 mV per tenfold change in extracellular potassium concentration is 
realized only at relatively high concentrations (solid straight line), with the slope becoming 
less and less as external potassium is reduced. This result indicates that the potassium ion 
distribution is not the only factor contributing to the membrane potential. 
The Effect of Sodium Permeability
From the experiments on squid axon we can conclude that the hypothesis made by Bernstein 
in 1902 is almost correct; the membrane potential is strongly but not exclusively depen-

dent on the potassium concentration ratio. We can explain the 
deviation from the Nernst relation shown in Figure 6.4 simply 
by abandoning the notion that the membrane is impermeable 
to sodium. Real nerve cell membranes, in fact, have a perme-
ability to sodium that ranges between 1% and 10% of their 
permeability to potassium. 
To consider the effect of sodium permeability, we begin with 
our model cell (see Figure 6.1) and, for the moment, ignore any 
movement of chloride ions. The Nernst equation tells us that 
sodium would be in equilibrium at a membrane potential +34 
mV (ENa), far from the actual membrane potential of –85 mV. 
So, if we make the membrane permeable to sodium, both the 
concentration gradient and the membrane potential tend to 
drive sodium into the cell. As sodium ions enter the cell, they 
accumulate on the inner surface of the membrane, causing depo-
larization. As a result, potassium is no longer in equilibrium and 
potassium ions leave the cell. As the depolarization progresses, 
the membrane potential moves closer to the sodium equilibrium 
potential and farther from the potassium equilibrium potential. 
As it does so, the sodium influx decreases and the potassium 
efflux increases. The process continues until the influx of sodium 
is exactly balanced by the efflux of potassium. At that point there 
is no further charge accumulation, and the membrane potential 
remains constant. In summary, the membrane potential lies 
between the potassium and sodium equilibrium potentials and is the potential at which 
the sodium and potassium currents are exactly equal and opposite. 
Chloride ions participate in the process as well but, as we have already seen, there is 
ultimately an adjustment in intracellular chloride concentration in the model cell, so that 
the chloride equilibrium potential matches the new membrane potential. As the cation 
fluxes gradually reach a balance, the intracellular chloride concentration increases until 
there is no net chloride flux across the membrane. 
The Constant Field Equation
To determine the exact membrane potential in our model cell, we have to consider the 
individual ion currents across the membrane. The inward sodium current (iNa) depends 
on the driving force for sodium, which is the difference between the membrane potential 
and the sodium equilibrium potential, Vm – ENa, (see Chapter 2). The sodium current also 
depends on the sodium conductance of the membrane, or gNa. The sodium conductance 
is a measure of the ease with which sodium can pass through the membrane and depends 
on the number of open sodium channels—the more open channels the greater the con-
ductance. So, the sodium current is:
iNa = gNa(Vm – ENa)
 The same relationship holds for potassium and chloride:
iK = gK(Vm – EK) 
iCl = gCl(Vm – ECl) 
If we assume that chloride is in equilibrium, so that iCl = 0, then for the membrane poten-
tial to remain constant, the potassium and sodium currents must be equal and opposite: 
gK(Vm – EK) = –gNa(Vm – ENa) 
It is useful to examine this relationship in more detail. Suppose gK is much larger than gNa. 
Then, if the currents are to be equal, the driving force for potassium efflux must be much 
smaller than that for sodium entry. In other words, the membrane potential must be much 
closer to EK than to ENa. Conversely, if gNa is relatively large, the membrane potential will 
be closer to ENa.

The straight line is drawn with a slope of 58 mV per tenfold change in 
extracellular potassium concentration, according to the Nernst equa-
tion. Because the membrane is also permeable to sodium, the points 
deviate from the straight line, especially at low potassium concentra-
tions. (After Hodgkin and Keynes, 1956.)

Note that the chloride ratios are reversed, as occurred previously in the Nernst equation, 
because  the chloride valence is –1.
As before, if chloride is in equilibrium, the chloride terms disappear. This equation is 
sometimes called the GHK equation for its originators, and is known also as the constant 
field equation, because one of the assumptions made in arriving at the expression was that 
the voltage gradient or “field” across the membrane is uniform. The constant field equation 
is entirely analogous to the previous equation and makes the same predictions: when the 
permeability to potassium is very high relative to the sodium and chloride permeabilities, 
the sodium and chloride terms become negligible and the membrane potential approaches 
the equilibrium potential for potassium: Vm = 58 log ([K]o/([K]i). Increasing sodium perme-
ability causes the membrane potential to move toward the sodium equilibrium potential. 
The constant field equation provides us with a useful general principle to remember: 
the membrane potential depends on the relative conductances (or permeabilities) of the 
membrane to the major ions, and on the equilibrium potentials for those ions. In real cells 
the resting permeabilities to potassium and chloride are relatively high. Hence, the resting 
membrane potential is close to the potassium and chloride equilibrium potentials. When 
sodium permeability is increased, as occurs during an action potential (see Chapter 7) 
or an excitatory postsynaptic potential (see Chapter 11), the membrane potential moves 
toward the sodium equilibrium potential. 
The Resting Membrane Potential
As useful as the constant field equation is, it does not provide 
us with an accurate description of the resting membrane po-
tential because the requirement for zero net current across 
the membrane is not, in itself, adequate. Instead, for the cell 
to remain in a stable condition each individual ionic current 
must be zero. As a result, under the conditions of the constant 
field equation, the cell would gradually fill up with sodium and 
chloride and lose potassium. In real cells, intracellular sodium 
and potassium concentrations are kept constant by a sodium–
potassium exchange pump (sodium–potassium ATPase; see 
Chapter 9). As sodium and potassium leak into and out of the 
cell, the pump transports a matching amount of each ion in 
the opposite direction (Figure 6.5). Thus, metabolic energy is 
used to maintain the cell in a steady state. 
In order to have a more complete and accurate description 
of the resting membrane potential, we must consider both the 
passive ion fluxes and the activity of the pump. Again, we first 
consider the currents carried by passive fluxes of sodium and 
potassium across the membrane:

(A) Net passive ion movements across the membrane are indicated 
by dashed arrows and transport systems by solid arrows and circles. 
Lengths of arrows indicate the magnitudes of net ion movements. Total 
flux is zero for each ion. For example, net inward leak of Na+ is equal 
to rate of outward transport. Na:K transport is coupled with a ratio of 
3:2. In any particular cell, Cl– transport may be outward (as shown) or 
inward.

iNa = gNa(Vm – ENa)
iK = gK(Vm – EK) 
We no longer assume that the sodium and potassium currents are equal and opposite, but 
if we know how they are related we can, as before, obtain an equation for the membrane 
potential in terms of the sodium and potassium equilibrium potentials and their relative 
conductances. The relationship between the sodium and potassium currents is given by 
the characteristics of the pump. Because it keeps intracellular sodium and potassium con-
centrations constant by transporting the ions in the ratio of 3Na to 2K (see Chapter 9), it 
follows that the passive ion fluxes must be in the same ratio: iNa:iK = 3:2. So we can write:

 The equation is similar to the expression derived previously for the model cell and makes 
the same kinds of predictions. As before, the membrane potential depends on the relative 
magnitudes of gK and gNa. The difference is that the potassium term is multiplied by a factor 
of 1.6. Because of this factor, the membrane potential is closer to EK than would otherwise 
be the case. Thus, the driving force for sodium entry is increased and that for potassium 
influx reduced. As a result, the passive fluxes are in a ratio of 3Na to 2K rather than 1:1. 
In summary, the real cell differs from the model cell in that the resting membrane potential 
is the potential at which the passive influx of sodium is 1.5 times the passive efflux of potassium, 
rather than the potential at which the two fluxes are equal and opposite. The passive inward 
and outward currents are determined by the equilibrium potentials and conductances for the 
two ions; the required ratio of 3:2 is determined by the transport characteristics of the pump.
The problem of finding an expression for the resting membrane potential of real cells, 
taking into account the transport activity, was first considered by Mullins and Noda,6
who used intracellular microelectrodes to study the effects of ionic changes on membrane 
potential in muscle. Like Goldman, Hodgkin, and Katz, they derived an expression for 
membrane potential in terms of permeabilities and concentrations. The result is equivalent 
to the equation we have just derived using conductances and equilibrium potentials:

where r is the absolute value of the transport ratio (3:2). The equation provides an accurate 
description of the resting membrane potential, provided all the other permeant ions (e.g., 
chloride) are in a steady state.
Chloride Distribution
How do these considerations apply to chloride? As for all other ions, there must be no net 
chloride current across the resting membrane. As already discussed (see Figure 6.2B), chloride 
is able to reach equilibrium simply by an appropriate adjustment in internal concentration, 
without affecting the steady-state membrane potential. In many cells, however, there are 
transport systems for chloride as well (see Chapter 9). In squid axon and in muscle, chlo-
ride is transported actively into the cells; in many nerve cells, active transport is outward 
(see Figure 6.5). The effect of inward transport is to add an increment to the equilibrium 
concentration such that there is an outward leak of chloride equal to the rate of transport 
in the opposite direction.7 Outward transport has the reverse effect.
An Electrical Model of the Membrane
The characteristics of the nerve cell membrane endow it with the electrical properties illus-
trated in Figure 6.6. First, because the membrane is an insulating layer separating electrical

charges on its inner and outer surfaces, it has the properties of a capacitor. In parallel with 
the capacitor are conductance pathways, represented by resistors, that allow ion fluxes 
into and out of the cell. The electrical resistance in each pathway is inversely related to 
the conductance for the ion in question: the greater the ionic conductance the lower the 
resistance to current flow. Passive ion currents through the resistors are driven by batter-
ies that represent the equilibrium potentials for each of the ions. The passive currents are 
equal and opposite to the corresponding currents generated by the pumps, so that the net 
current across the membrane for each ion is zero. 
Predicted Values of Membrane Potential
How do these considerations explain the relation between potassium concentration and 
membrane potential shown in Figure 6.4? This can be seen by using real numbers in the 
equations. In squid axon, the permeability constants for potassium and sodium are roughly 
in the ratio 1.0:0.04.5 We can use these relative values, together with the ion concentrations 
given in Table 6.1, to calculate the resting membrane potential in seawater:

Now we can see quantitatively why, when extracellular potassium is altered, the membrane 
potential fails to follow the Nernst potential for potassium. If, in the numerator of the equa-
tion, we look at the magnitude of the term involving extracellular potassium concentration 
(1.5 × 10 = 15 mM) and the term that involves extracellular sodium concentration (0.04 × 
460 = 18.4 mM), we see that potassium contributes only about 45% of the total. Because 
of this, doubling the external potassium concentration does not double the numerator (as 
would happen in the Nernst equation), and as a consequence, the effect on the potential of 
changing extracellular potassium concentration is less than would be expected if potassium 
were the only permeant ion. When the external potassium concentration is raised to a high 
enough level (100 mM in Figure 6.4), the potassium term becomes sufficiently dominant 
for the voltage-current relation to approach the theoretical limit of 58 mV per tenfold 
change in concentration. This effect is enhanced by the fact that many potassium channels 
are voltage-activated (see Chapter 7). When the membrane is depolarized by increasing 
the extracellular potassium concentration, the voltage-activated channels open, thereby 
increasing the potassium permeability. As a result, the relative contribution of potassium 
to the membrane potential is still further increased. 
In general, nerve cells have resting potentials of the order of –70 mV. In some cells, 
such as vertebrate skeletal muscle,8 the resting potential can be –90 mV or larger, reflecting

(A) EK, ENa and ECl are the Nernst potentials for the individual ions. The individual ion 
conductances are represented by resistors, with a resistance 1/g for each ion. The 
individual ion currents, iK, iNa, and iCl are equal and opposite to the currents iT(K), iT(Na), 
and iT(Cl) supplied by the sodium–potassium exchange pump (TNa – K) and the chloride 
pump (TCl), so that the net flux of each ion across the membrane is zero. The resulting 
membrane potential (Vm) determines the amount of charge stored on the membrane 
capacitor (Cm).

a low ratio of sodium-to-potassium permeability. Glial cells in particular have a very low 
resting permeability to sodium so that their membrane potential is nearly identical to the 
potassium equilibrium potential (see Chapter 10). Other cells, such as leech ganglion cells9
and photoreceptors in the retina,10 have relatively high membrane permeability to sodium 
and resting membrane potentials as small as –40 mV. 
Contribution of the Sodium–Potassium Pump 
to the Membrane Potential
The sodium–potassium transport system is electrogenic because each cycle of the pump 
results in the net outward transfer of one positive ion, thereby contributing to the excess 
negative charge on the inner face of the membrane. How large is this contribution? An 
easy way to find out is to calculate what the membrane potential would be if the pump 
were not electrogenic or, in other words, if r = 1. Repeating the previous calculation with 
this condition gives the following:

The result is 6 mV less than the previous value, so the pump contributes –6 mV to the 
resting potential. In general, the size of the pump contribution depends on a number of 
factors, particularly the relative ion permeabilities. For a transport ratio of 3:2, the steady 
state contribution to the resting membrane potential is limited to a maximum of about 
–11 mV.11 If the transport process is stopped, the electrogenic contribution disappears 
immediately and the membrane potential then declines gradually as the cell gains sodium 
and loses potassium. 
 It is interesting that the rate of transport does not appear in the equation, apart from 
the implicit requirement that it must match the passive ionic fluxes. Theoretical calcula-
tions indicate that once that requirement is met any further increase in sodium–potassium 
pump activity can be expected to have very little effect on the steady-state resting membrane 
potential.12 This is largely because the transport system is dependent on intracellular sodium 
concentration (see Chapter 9). Any increase in pump rate results in hyperpolarization and 
depletion of intracellular sodium. As the sodium concentration falls, the pump rate and 
the membrane potential return toward their previous value. 
What Ion Channels Are Associated with the Resting Potential?
The resting permeabilities of membranes to sodium, potassium, and chloride have been 
determined in many nerve cells. Underlying these is a wide variety of membrane channels 
that permit the passage of anions and cations into and out of the cell. However, the pre-
cise identification of the channels underlying these ionic leak currents in any specific cells 
is difficult. A significant fraction of the resting potassium current is likely to be through 
2P potassium channels (see Chapter 5), which tend to be open at the resting membrane 
potential.13,14 In addition, many nerve cells have M-type potassium channels that are 
open at rest and closed by intracellular messengers (see Chapter 17). M-currents, together 
with accompanying h-currents, are responsible for most of the potassium leak in sympa-
thetic ganglion cells.15 H-currents are carried by HCN (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic 
nucleotide-gated) channels that are activated by hyperpolarization—some of which are 
open at normal resting potentials.16 HCN channels are cation channels with a sodium-to-
potassium permeability ratio (pNa/pK) of about 0.25 and thus are responsible for a fraction 
of the sodium leak current as well. Other contributors to resting potassium permeability 
include channels activated by intracellular cations, namely sodium-activated and calcium-
activated potassium channels. Finally, a few voltage-sensitive potassium channels associated 
with the action potential may be open at rest. 
Apart from HCN channels, the major source of resting sodium permeability is the 
so-called NALCN (sodium leak channel, non-selective) channel that is open at rest.17
NALCN channels are virtually non-selective for monovalent cations (pNa/pK ≈ 1.1), so 
that at normal resting potentials the main ion movement through the channels is inward 
sodium flux. An additional sodium influx occurs not through channels, but rather through

sodium-dependent secondary active transport systems (see Chapter 9). Finally, tetrodotoxin 
has been shown to block a small fraction of the resting sodium conductance,9  indicating 
a contribution by voltage-activated sodium channels. 
An unusual pathological leak current in skeletal muscle cells is found in a neuromus-
cular disease known as hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. The current is unusual in that 
it does not involve ion movements through open channels. Instead, it is associated with 
cation fluxes through a normally occluded protein pore around the sodium channel S4 
helix.18 This so-called omega current (see Chapter 7) is associated with a mutation in 
which charge-carrying arginine residues on the helix are replaced by smaller neutral amino 
acids, thereby allowing cations to permeate the pore. The result is a constant inward leak 
of sodium into the muscle cell. 
Chloride channels of the CLC family (see Chapter 5) are widely distributed in nerve 
and muscle. The presence of chloride channels is important in that they serve to stabilize 
the membrane potential (see below). The channels also interact with chloride transport 
systems to determine intracellular chloride concentrations.19,20 For example, in embryonic 
hippocampal neurons CLC channel expression is low, and ECl is positive to the resting 
membrane potential because of inward transport and accumulation of chloride in the 
cytoplasm. In adult neurons, expression of CLC channels increases the chloride conductance 
of the membrane so that excess accumulation cannot occur, and ECl becomes equal to the 
membrane potential. In central nervous system neurons, chloride channels can account 
for as much as 10% of the resting membrane conductance.21 
Changes in Membrane Potential
It is important to keep in mind that this discussion of resting membrane potential is always 
in reference to steady state conditions. For example, we have said that changing extracellular 
chloride concentration has little effect on membrane potential because the intracellular chlo-
ride concentration accommodates to the change. That is true in the long run, but the intracel-
lular adjustment takes time, and while it is occurring, there will indeed be a transient effect. 
The steady-state potential is the baseline upon which all changes in membrane poten-
tial are superimposed. How are such changes in potential produced? In general, transient 
changes, such as those that mediate signaling between cells in the nervous system, are 
the result of transient changes in membrane permeability. As we already know from the 
constant field equation, an increase in sodium permeability (or a decrease in potassium 
permeability) will move the membrane potential toward the sodium equilibrium potential, 
producing depolarization. Conversely, an increase in potassium permeability will produce 
hyperpolarization. Another ion of importance in signaling is calcium. Intracellular calcium 
concentration is very low, and in most cells, ECa is greater than +150 mV. Thus, an increase 
in calcium permeability results in calcium influx and depolarization. 
The role of chloride permeability in the control of membrane potential is of particular 
interest. As we have noted, chloride makes little contribution to the resting membrane po-
tential. Instead, intracellular chloride concentration adjusts to the potential and is modified 
by whatever chloride transport mechanisms are operating in the cell membrane. The effect 
of a transient increase in chloride permeability can be either hyperpolarizing or depolarizing, 
depending on whether the chloride equilibrium potential is negative or positive to the resting 
potential. The equilibrium potential, in turn, depends on whether intracellular chloride is 
depleted or concentrated by the transport system. In either case, the change in potential is 
usually relatively small. Even so, an increase in chloride permeability can be important for 
the regulation of signaling because it tends to hold the membrane potential near the chloride 
equilibrium potential and thus attenuates changes in potential produced by other influences.
Stabilization of the membrane potential in this way is important for controlling the 
excitability of many cells, such as skeletal muscle fibers, that have a relatively high chloride 
permeability at rest. In such cells, a transient influx of positive ions causes less depolariza-
tion than would otherwise be the case, because it is countered by an influx of chloride 
through already open channels. This mechanism is of some significance, as illustrated by 
the fact that chloride channel mutations that reduce chloride conductance are responsible 
for several muscle diseases. The diseased muscles are hyperexcitable (myotonic) due to loss 
of the normal stabilizing influence of a high-chloride conductance.22,23

SUMMARY
 
■
Nerve cells have high intracellular concentrations of 
potassium and low intracellular concentrations of 
sodium and chloride so that potassium tends to diffuse 
out of the cell and sodium and chloride tend to diffuse 
in. The tendency for potassium and chloride to diffuse 
down their concentration gradients is opposed by the 
electrical potential across the cell membrane. 
 
■
In a model cell that is permeable only to potassium and 
chloride, the concentration gradients can be balanced 
exactly by the membrane potential, so that there is 
no net flux of either ion across the membrane. The 
membrane potential is then equal to the equilibrium 
potential for both potassium and chloride.
 
■
Changing the extracellular potassium concentration 
changes the potassium equilibrium potential and, 
hence, the membrane potential. Changing extracellular 
chloride concentration, on the other hand, leads 
ultimately to a change in intracellular chloride, so that 
the chloride equilibrium potential and the membrane 
potential differ from their original values only transiently.
 
■
In addition to being permeable to potassium and 
chloride, the plasma membrane of real cells is 
permeable to sodium. As a result, there is a constant 
influx of sodium into the cell and an efflux of potassium. 
These fluxes are balanced exactly by active transport 
of the ions in the opposite directions, in the ratio of 3 
sodium to 2 potassium. Under these circumstances, the 
membrane potential depends on the sodium equilibrium 
potential, the potassium equilibrium potential, the 
relative conductance of the membrane to the two ions, 
and the sodium–potassium exchange pump ratio.
 
■
Because the sodium–potassium exchange pump 
transports more positive ions outward than inward 
across the membrane, it can make a direct contribution 
of several mV to the membrane potential. 
 
■
The chloride equilibrium potential may be positive or 
negative to the resting membrane potential, depending 
on chloride transport processes. Although the chloride 
distribution plays little role in determining the resting 
membrane potential, high chloride permeability is 
important for electrical stability.


■ CHAPTER 7
Ionic Basis of the 
Action Potential
T
he ionic mechanisms responsible for generating action potentials have been described 
quantitatively, largely through the use of the voltage clamp method to measure membrane 
currents. From such measurements, it is possible to determine which components of the 
currents are carried by each ion species, and to deduce the magnitude and time course of the 
underlying changes in ionic conductances. The experiments have shown that depolarization rap-
idly increases sodium conductance and, more slowly, potassium conductance. The activation of 
sodium conductance is transient, being followed by inactivation. The increase in potassium con-
ductance persists for as long as the depolarizing pulse is maintained. The dependence of sodium 
and potassium conductances on membrane potential and their sequential timing account quanti-
tatively for the amplitude and time course of the action potential as well as for other phenomena 
such as threshold and refractory period.
Other channels, in addition to the voltage-dependent sodium and potassium channels just 
described, can be involved in action potential generation. In some cells, voltage-activated calcium 
channels are responsible for the rising phase of the action potential, and repolarization can involve 
currents associated with activation of a number of additional potassium channel types. The action 
potential itself can be followed by afterpotentials, which are periods of hyperpolarization or depo-
larization mediated by prolonged changes in membrane conductance.

114 Chapter 7
In Chapter 6, we showed how the membrane potential of a nerve cell depends on its relative 
permeability to the major ions present in the extracellular and intracellular fluids, particularly 
sodium and potassium. The membrane potential of a cell at rest is near the potassium equi-
librium potential because of the relatively high permeability of its membrane for potassium. 
It was discovered more than 100 years ago that sodium ions were necessary for nerve and 
muscle cells to produce an action potential, and evidence gradually accumulated to support 
the idea that the mechanism underlying action potential generation was an increase in sodium 
permeability that drove the membrane potential toward the sodium equilibrium potential. 
Critical experiments were done in the early 1950s by Hodgkin, Huxley and Katz,1 and 
Hodgkin and Huxley.2–5 Two main features contributed to the success of their experiments: 
One was the availability of the giant axon of the squid, and the other a newly developed 
experimental tool called the voltage clamp. They found that the rising and falling phases 
of the action potential were accompanied by a large, transient influx of sodium ions, fol-
lowed by an efflux of potassium. They then were able to deduce the underlying changes in 
membrane conductance and to show that these were of the correct magnitude and time 
course to account exactly for the magnitude and time course of the action potential. Since 
that time a great number of similar experiments have been carried out on other nerve 
cells and on muscle cells, and many new experimental techniques have been applied to the 
problem. Although some of the details of their theoretical treatment are still being tested 
and refined, after more than 50 years their basic conclusions still stand. 
Voltage Clamp Experiments
The voltage clamp technique was devised by Cole and his colleagues6 and developed further 
by Hodgkin, Huxley and Katz.1  The aim of the experiments was to identify the nature of 
the ionic currents underlying the action potential and to determine their magnitude and 
time course. The experimental arrangement is described in Box 7.1. All we need to know to 
understand the experiments themselves is that the method permits us to set the membrane 
potential of the cell almost instantaneously to any level and hold it there (i.e., “clamp” it) while 
at the same time recording the current flowing across the membrane. Figure 7.1A shows an 
example of the currents that occur when the membrane potential is stepped suddenly from 
its resting value (in this example –65 mV) to a depolarized level (–9 mV). The current pro-
duced by the voltage step consists of three phases: (1) a brief outward surge lasting only a few 
microseconds (µs), (2) an early inward current, and (3) a late outward current. 
Capacitative and Leak Currents 
The initial brief surge of current is the capacitative current, which occurs because the step 
from one potential to another alters the charge on the membrane capacitance. If the clamp 
amplifier is capable of delivering a large amount of current, then the membrane can be charged 
rapidly and this current will last only a very short time. In practice, the surge of capacitative 
current lasts only about 20 μs and can be ignored when analyzing the subsequent ionic currents.
The capacitative current is followed by a small, steady outward current, known as leak cur-
rent, which flows through the resting membrane conductances. Leak current is carried largely 
by potassium and chloride ions, varies linearly with voltage displacement from rest in either 
direction, and lasts throughout the duration of the voltage step. However, during most of the 
response, it is obscured by the much larger ionic currents associated with the action potential.
Ionic Currents Carried by Sodium and Potassium 
Turning now to the second and third phases of membrane current, Hodgkin and Huxley 
showed that these currents were due to the entry of sodium across the cell membrane, fol-
lowed by the exit of potassium. In addition, they were able to deduce the relative size and 
time course of the separate currents. One convenient procedure was to abolish the sodium 
current by replacing most of the extracellular sodium by choline (an impermeant cation). 
With an appropriate reduction in extracellular sodium concentration, the sodium equi-
librium potential could be made equal to the potential during the depolarizing step. As a 
result, there was no driving force for sodium entry during the step and thus no net current

through the activated sodium channels. This left only the potassium current, as shown 
in Figure 7.1D. Subtraction of the potassium current from the total ion current (Figure 
7.1A) then revealed the magnitude and time course of the sodium current (Figure 7.1C).
Selective Poisons for Sodium 
and Potassium Channels 
Pharmacological methods now exist for blocking sodium and po-
tassium currents selectively. Two toxins that have been particularly 
useful for inactivating sodium channels are tetrodotoxin (TTX) 
and its pharmacological equivalent saxitoxin (STX).7,8 TTX is a 
virulent poison, concentrated in the ovaries and other organs 
of puffer fish. STX is synthesized by marine dinoflagellates and 
concentrated by filter-feeding shellfish, such as the butter clam 
Saxidomus. Its virulence competes with that of TTX—ingestion 
of a single clam (cooked or not) can be fatal. Sodium channels are 
blocked by several snail toxins (conotoxins) as well.9 
The great advantage of TTX for neurophysiological studies 
is its high specificity. When a TTX-poisoned axon is subjected 
to a depolarizing voltage step, no inward sodium current is seen, 
only the delayed outward potassium current (Figure 7.2B). The 
potassium current is unchanged in amplitude and time course by 
the poison. Application of TTX to the inside of the membrane by 
adding it to an internal perfusing solution has no effect. The ac-
tions of STX are indistinguishable from those of TTX. Both toxins

appear to bind to the same site in the outer mouth of the channel through which sodium 
ions move, thereby physically blocking ion current through the channel.10 
Isolation of the currents underlying the action potential has also been aided by the 
discovery of a number of substances that block voltage-activated potassium channels. For 
example, in squid axons and in frog myelinated axons, Armstrong, Hille, and others have 
shown that voltage-activated potassium currents are blocked by tetraethylammonium (TEA), 
in concentrations greater than 10 mM, as shown in Figure 7.2C.11 In squid axons, TEA must 
be added to the internal solution and exerts its action at the inner mouth of the potassium 
channel; in other preparations, such as the frog node of Ranvier, TEA is effective when applied 
to the outside as well. Other compounds, such as 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), block potassium 
currents as well, as do the peptide toxins apamin, dendrotoxin, and charybdotoxin.12
Dependence of Ion Currents on Membrane Potential 
Having established that the early and late currents were due to sodium influx followed 
by potassium efflux, Hodgkin and Huxley then determined how the magnitude and time 
■  BOX 7.1
The Voltage Clamp
The figure shown here illustrates an experimental arrange-
ment for voltage clamp experiments on squid axons. Two fine 
silver wires are inserted longitudinally into the axon, which is 
bathed in sea water. One of the wires provides a measure 
of the potential inside the fiber with respect to that of the 
seawater (which is grounded) or, in other words, a measure of 
the membrane potential (Vm). It is also connected to one input 
of the voltage clamp amplifier. The other input is connected 
to a variable voltage source, which can be set by the person 
doing the experiment; the value to which it is set is thus 
known as the command potential. The voltage clamp ampli-
fier delivers current from its output whenever there is a volt-
age difference between the inputs. The output current flows 
across the cell membrane between the second fine silver wire 
and the seawater (arrows); it is measured by the voltage drop 
across a small series resistor. 
The circuit is arranged so that the output current tends 
to cancel any voltage difference between the two inputs 
(negative feedback). It works as follows: first, suppose that 
the resting potential of the fiber is –70 mV and the command 
potential is set to –70 mV as well. Because the voltages at 
the two inputs of the amplifier are equal, there will be no out-
put current. If the command potential is stepped to, say, –65 
mV, then because of the 5 mV difference between the inputs, 
the amplifier delivers positive current into the axon and across 
the cell membrane. The current produces a voltage drop 
across the membrane, driving Vm to –65 mV and removing 
the voltage difference between the two inputs. In this way, the 
membrane potential is kept equal to the command potential. If 
the circuitry is properly designed, the change in Vm is achieved 
within a few microseconds.
Now suppose that the command potential is stepped 
from –70 mV to –15 mV. We would expect the amplifier to de-
liver positive current to the axon to drive Vm to –15 mV, which 
is indeed what happens, but only transiently. Then something 
more interesting occurs. The depolarization to –15 mV pro-
duces an increase in sodium conductance and there is a con-
sequent flow of sodium ions inward, across the membrane. In 
the absence of the clamp, this influx would tend to depolarize 
the membrane still further (i.e., toward the sodium equilib-
rium potential); with the clamp in place, however, the amplifier 
provides just the correct amount of negative current to hold 
the membrane potential constant. In other words, the current 
provided by the amplifier is exactly equal to the current flowing 
across the membrane. Here, then, is the great power of the 
voltage clamp: in addition to holding the membrane potential 
constant, it provides an exact measure of the membrane cur-
rent required to do so. Voltage clamp measurements can now 
be made in small nerve cells by using the whole-cell method 
of patch clamp recording (see Chapter 4).

course of the currents depended on membrane potential. Currents produced by various 
levels of depolarization from a holding potential of –65 mV are shown in Figure 7.3A. First 
of all, a step hyperpolarization to –85 mV (lower record) produces only a small inward leak 
current, as would be expected from the resting properties of the membrane. As already 
shown in Figure 7.1, moderately depolarizing steps each produce an early inward current 
followed by a sustained outward current. With greater depolarizations, the early current 
becomes smaller, is absent at about +52 mV, and then reverses to become outward as the 
depolarizing step is increased still further to +65 mV.
The dependence of the two currents on membrane potential is shown in Figure 7.3B, 
in which the peak amplitude of the early current and the steady-state amplitude of the 
late current are plotted against the potential to which the membrane is stepped. With hy-
perpolarizing steps, there are no time-dependent (early and late) currents; the membrane 
simply responds as a passive resistor, with the expected inward current. The late current 
also behaves as one would expect of a resistor in the sense that depolarization produces 
outward current. However, as the depolarization is increased, the magnitude of the current 
becomes much greater than expected from the resting membrane properties. This is due to 
the activation of voltage-gated potassium channels. As the membrane potential becomes 
more positive, more and more potassium channels open, allowing additional current 
to flow through the membrane. The behavior of the early inward current is much more 
complex than that of the outward current. The early current first increases with increasing 
depolarization and then decreases, becoming zero at about +52 mV and then reversing in 
sign. The reversal potential is very near the equilibrium potential for sodium, as expected 
for a current carried by sodium ions. 
The magnitude of the sodium current depends on the sodium conductance (gNa) and 
on the driving force for sodium entry (Vm – ENa). One might expect, therefore, that the peak 
inward current would decrease as the membrane potential step gets progressively closer 
to the sodium equilibrium potential and the driving force is reduced. However, between 
about –50 mV and +10 mV there is a marked increase in sodium conductance due to the 
activation of voltage-gated sodium channels, which greatly outweighs the decrease in driving 
force. Thus, the sodium current, iNa = gNa(Vm – ENa), increases. In this voltage range, the 
current–voltage relation is said to have a region of negative slope conductance. Beyond 
about +10 mV there is no further increase in conductance and the current decreases toward 
zero as the step potential approaches the sodium equilibrium potential. 
Inactivation of the Sodium Current 
The time courses of the sodium and potassium currents are markedly different. The po-
tassium current is much delayed relative to the onset of the sodium current, but once de-
veloped, it remains high throughout the duration of the step. The sodium current, on the 
other hand, rises much more rapidly but then decreases to zero, even though the membrane 
depolarization is maintained. This decline of the sodium current is called inactivation.

118 Chapter 7
Hodgkin and Huxley had the insight to realize that 
activation of the sodium current and its subsequent inacti-
vation represented two separate processes and so designed 
experiments to study the nature of inactivation in detail. In 
particular, they investigated the effect of hyperpolarizing 
and depolarizing prepulses on the peak amplitude of the 
sodium current produced by a subsequent depolarizing step.
Records from such an experiment are shown in Figure 
7.4. In Figure 7.4A, the membrane is stepped from a holding 
potential of –65 mV to –21 mV, producing a peak sodium 
current of about 1 milliampere/centimeter2 (mA/cm2). When the step is 
preceded by a hyperpolarizing prepulse to –78 mV, the peak sodium current 
is increased (Figure 7.4B). Depolarizing prepulses, on the other hand, cause a 
decrease in the sodium current (Figure 7.4C,D). The effects of hyperpolarizing 
and depolarizing prepulses are time-dependent; thus, brief pulses of only a few 
milliseconds (ms) duration have little effect. In the experiment shown here, 
the prepulses are of sufficient duration (30 ms) for the effects to reach their 
maximum. The results are shown quantitatively in Figure 7.4E, in which the 
peak sodium current is plotted against the potential during the prepulse. The 
peak current after a prepulse is expressed as a fraction of the control current. 
With a depolarizing prepulse to about –30 mV the subsequent sodium cur-
rent was reduced to zero (i.e., inactivation was complete). Hyperpolarizing 
prepulses to –100 mV or beyond increased the sodium current by a maximum 
of about 70%. Hodgkin and Huxley represented this range of sodium currents from zero 
to their maximum value with a single parameter (h), varying from zero to 1, as indicated 
on the right-hand ordinate of Figure 7.4E. Note that zero means no activation (complete 
inactivation), and 1 means full activation (no inactivation). In these experiments, the peak 
sodium current reached only about 60% of its maximum value upon depolarization from 
the resting potential. Subsequent experiments have shown that all neurons show some degree 
of sodium channel inactivation at rest.
Sodium and Potassium Conductances as Functions of Potential
Having measured the magnitude and time course of sodium and potassium currents as 
a function of the membrane potential (Vm) and knowing the equilibrium potentials (ENa
and EK), Hodgkin and Huxley were then able to deduce the magnitude and time courses 
of the sodium and potassium conductance changes, using the relations:

conductance and membrane potential are shown for sodium and potassium in Figure 7.5B. 
The curves are remarkably similar, indicating that the two gating mechanisms have similar 
voltage sensitivities. In summary, the results obtained by Hodgkin and Huxley indicate that 
depolarization of the nerve membrane leads to three distinct processes: (1) activation of 
a sodium conductance mechanism; (2) subsequent inactivation of that mechanism; and 
(3) delayed activation of a potassium conductance mechanism. 
Quantitative Description of Sodium 
and Potassium Conductances
After obtaining the experimental results, Hodgkin and Huxley proceeded to develop a 
mathematical description of the precise time courses of the sodium and potassium conduc-
tance changes produced by the depolarizing voltage steps. To deal first with the potassium 
conductance, one might imagine that the effect of a sudden change in membrane potential 
would be to cause the movement of one or more charges in a voltage-sensitive potassium 
channel that would then lead to channel opening. If a single process were involved, then 
the change in the overall potassium conductance might be expected to be governed by 
ordinary, first-order kinetics—that is, its rise after the onset of the voltage step would be 
exponential. Instead the onset of the conductance change was found to be S-shaped, with 
a marked delay. Because of this delay and because the potassium conductance increase oc-
curred during depolarization but not hyperpolarization (i.e., it rectified), it was called the 
delayed rectifier. Hodgkin and Huxley were able to account for the S-shaped onset of the 
conductance by assuming that the opening of each potassium channel required the activa-
tion of four first-order processes, for example the movement of four charged particles in 
the membrane. In other words, the S-shaped time course of activation could be fitted by 
the product of four exponential distribution. The increase in potassium conductance for 
a given voltage step, then, was described by the relation: 
gK = gK(max)n4
where gK(max) is the maximum conductance reached for the particular voltage step and n 
is a rising exponential function varying between zero and unity, given by n = 1 – e–(t/τn). 
The exponential time constant (τn) is also voltage dependent, with the increase in 
conductance becoming more rapid with larger depolarizing steps. At 10°C, τn ranges from 
about 4 ms for small depolarizations to 1 ms for depolarization to zero mV.

120 Chapter 7
The time course of the rise in sodium conductance, also S-shaped, was fitted by an 
exponential raised to the third power. In contrast, the fall in sodium conductance due to 
inactivation was consistent with a simple exponential decay process. For a given voltage 
step, the overall time course of the sodium conductance change was the product of the 
activation and inactivation processes: 
gNa = gNa(max)m3h 
where gNa(max) is the maximum level to which gNa would rise if there were no inactivation 
and m = 1 – e–(t/τm). The inactivation process is a falling, rather than a rising, exponen-
tial and is given by h = e–(t/τh). As with the potassium activation time constant, both τm
and τh are voltage dependent. The activation time constant τm is much shorter than that 
for potassium, having a value at 10°C of the order of 0.6 ms near the resting potential and 
decreasing to about 0.2 ms at zero potential. The inactivation time constant for τh, on the 
other hand, is similar to that for potassium activation. 
Reconstruction of the Action Potential
Once the theoretical expressions were obtained for sodium 
and potassium conductances as a function of voltage and 
time, Hodgkin and Huxley were able to predict both the 
entire time course of the action potential and of the un-
derlying conductance changes. Starting with a depolarizing 
step to just above threshold, they used their equations to 
calculate what the subsequent potential changes would be 
at successive intervals of 0.01 ms. Thus, during the first 
0.01 ms after the membrane had been depolarized to say, 
–45 mV, they calculated how gNa and gK would change, 
what increments of INa and IK would result, and then the 
effect of the net current on Vm. Knowing the change in 
Vm at the end of the first 0.01 ms, they then repeated the 
calculations for the next time increment, and so on, all 
through the rising and falling phases of the action po-
tential. This was a laborious exercise in the days before 
computers or even electronic calculators; Huxley had to 
make do with a slide rule. 
The calculations duplicated with remarkable ac-
curacy the naturally occurring action potential in the 
squid axon. Calculated and observed action potentials 
produced by brief depolarizing pulses at three different 
stimulus strengths are compared in Figure 7.6A. In order 
to appreciate fully the magnitude of this accomplishment, 
it is necessary to keep in mind that the calculations used 
to duplicate the action potential were based on current 
measurements made under completely artificial condi-
tions, with the membrane potential clamped first at one 
value and then at another. The mechanisms of action 
potential generation are summarized in Figure 7.6B, 
which shows the calculated magnitude and time course 
of a propagated action potential in a squid axon, together 
with the calculated changes in sodium and potassium 
conductance.
Threshold and Refractory Period
In addition to describing the action potential, Hodgkin 
and Huxley were able to use their results to explain, in 
terms of ionic conductance changes, many other proper-
ties of excitable axons, including the refractory period

and the threshold for excitation (see Chapter 1). Further, their findings are applicable to a 
wide variety of other excitable tissues. 
How do the findings predict the threshold membrane potential at which the impulse 
takes off? It would seem that a discontinuity, such as that which occurs at the threshold for 
excitation, would require a discontinuity in gNa or gK, yet both vary smoothly with membrane 
potential. The phenomenon can be understood if we imagine passing current through the 
membrane to depolarize it just to threshold and then turning the current off. Because the 
membrane is depolarized, there will be an increase in outward current over that at rest 
(through potassium and leak channels). We will also have activated some sodium channels, 
increasing the inward sodium current. At threshold, the inward and outward currents are 
exactly equal and opposite, just as they are at rest. However, there is an important differ-
ence: the balance of currents is now unstable. If a few extra sodium ions enter the cell the 
depolarization is increased, gNa increases, and more sodium enters. The outward current 
can no longer keep up with the sodium influx, and the regenerative process explodes. If, on 
the other hand, a few extra potassium ions leave the cell, the depolarization is decreased, 
gNa decreases rapidly, sodium current decreases, and the excess outward current causes 
repolarization. As the membrane potential approaches its resting level, the potassium 
current decreases until it again equals the resting inward sodium current. Depolarization 
above threshold results in an increase in gNa sufficient for inward sodium movement to 
swamp outward potassium movement immediately. Subthreshold depolarization fails to 
increase gNa sufficiently to override the resting potassium conductance. 
And how is the refractory period explained? Two changes develop during an action 
potential that make it impossible for the nerve fiber to produce a second action potential 
immediately. First, inactivation of sodium channels is maximal during the falling phase 
of the action potential and requires several more milliseconds to be removed. During this 
time few, if any, channels are available to contribute to a new increase in gNa. This results 
in an absolute refractory period that lasts throughout the falling phase of the action po-
tential during which no amount of externally applied depolarization can initiate a second 
regenerative response. Second, because of activation of potassium channels, gK is very large 
during the falling phase of the action potential and decreases slowly back to its resting level. 
Thus, a very large increase in gNa is required to override the residual gK and thereby initiate 
a regenerative depolarization. These mechanisms combine to produce a relative refractory 
period, during which the threshold gradually returns to normal as the potassium channels 
close and the sodium channels recover from inactivation. 
It was an extraordinary achievement for Hodgkin and Huxley to have provided rigorous 
quantitative explanations for such complex biophysical properties of membranes. Their find-
ings have since been shown to be generally applicable to action potential generation in both 
invertebrate and vertebrate neurons. However, the characteristics of action potentials vary 
greatly from one cell to another. For example, their durations can range from as little as 200 
microseconds up to many milliseconds. Associated with these differences in duration is the rate 
at which neurons can fire repetitively. Some manage to generate only a few action potentials 
per second, while others can fire at frequencies approaching 1000/second. These differences 
are related to differences in the channel types underlying depolarization and repolarization.13
For example, in central nervous system (CNS) neurons with brief spikes and high-frequency 
capability, the voltage-gated potassium channels associated with repolarization usually belong 
to the Kv3 family (see Chapter 5 for potassium channel classification). These channels have 
a very steep voltage dependence and activate and deactivate rapidly. They thereby promote 
rapid repolarization and, consequently, rapid removal of sodium channel inactivation. 
Further differences from the squid axon relate to the fact that in most neurons, currents 
through voltage-activated sodium and potassium channels are not the only contributors 
to the action potential. For example, inward currents through voltage-activated calcium 
channels can enhance and prolong depolarization. At the same time, calcium entry into 
the cell can generate outward potassium currents through calcium-activated potassium 
channels and thereby shorten the action potential. Thus, the characteristics of any given 
action potential depend on which types of ion channels are present in the membrane and 
on how currents through these channels interact. 
Although our knowledge of single-channel behavior has provided a new breadth to 
our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the action potential, by no

stretch of the imagination would single-channel studies on their own—without the previ-
ous voltage clamp experiments and insights—have been able to account for how a nerve 
cell generates and conducts impulses. The older work has become enriched by, rather than 
supplanted by, the new. 
Gating Currents
Hodgkin and Huxley suggested that sodium channel activation was associated with the 
translocation of charged structures or particles within the membrane. Such charge move-
ments would be expected to add to the capacitative current produced by a depolarizing 
voltage step. After a number of technical difficulties were resolved, currents of the expected 
magnitude and time course were finally seen.14,15 They are known as gating currents. 
How is the gating current separated from the usual capacitative current expected with a 
step change in membrane potential (e.g., see Figure 7.1)? Briefly, currents associated merely 
with charging and discharging the membrane capacitance should be symmetrical. That is, 
they should be of the same magnitude for depolarizing steps as for hyperpolarizing steps. 
On the other hand, currents associated with sodium channel activation should appear 
upon a depolarization of 50 mV from a holding potential of –70 mV, but not upon 50 mV 
hyperpolarization. In other words, if the channels are already closed, there should be no 
gating current upon further hyperpolarization. Similarly, gating currents associated with 
channel closing might be expected at the termination of a brief depolarizing pulse but not 
after a hyperpolarizing pulse. One experimental way of recording gating currents is to sum 
the currents produced by two identical voltage steps of opposite polarity, as shown in Figure 
7.7A. The asymmetry due to gating currents is shown in parts (a) and (b) of the figure. 
The current at the beginning of the depolarizing pulse is larger than that produced by the 
hyperpolarizing pulse because of the additional charge movement associated with gating of 
the sodium channel. When the two currents are added (c), the net result is the gating current. 
Gating currents are also known as asymmetry currents. An example of gating current in 
squid axon, obtained by cancellation of the capacitative current, is shown in Figure 7.7B. 
Voltage-sensitive potassium currents were blocked with TEA. A step depolarization of an 
internally perfused squid axon produced an outward gating current, followed by inward 
sodium current. The sodium current was much smaller than usual because extracellular 
sodium concentration was reduced to 20% of normal. In Figure 7.7C, the gating current is 
shown alone after tetrodotoxin was added to the solution to prevent sodium from entering

the cell (note the change in scale). The evidence that asymmetry 
currents are, in fact, associated with sodium channel activation 
has been summarized by Armstrong.16
Mechanisms of Activation and 
Inactivation
It is well established that the gating currents are associated with 
translocation of positively charged residues in the S4 segments 
of the channel protein (see Chapter 5), and the total charge 
transfer has been estimated in Shaker potassium channels to 
be about 13 unit charges per channel or, if all four S4 segments 
participate, about 3e0 per segment.17 Various schemes have been 
proposed in which the S4 helix responds to depolarization by 
translating and/or rotating within the membrane, thereby ef-
fecting a transfer of charge between the inner and outer aqueous 
compartments.18 Examples include a paddle model, in which 
the helix moves within the membrane to provide an outward 
charge translocation of about 20 Å,19 and a rotational model 
with charge translation over a relatively short distance.20 An 
example of the rotational model is shown in Figure 7.8. When 
the membrane is at the resting potential, positive charges on 
the S4 helix are exposed to the cytoplasm by way of an aqueous 
crevice extending into the protein structure, and the cytoplas-
mic end of the channel is blocked by close apposition of the 
S6 helices (Figure 7.8A). Upon depolarization, the change in 
potential drives the charges on S4 into the extracellular region of 
the crevice, causing the helix to rotate (Figure 7.8B). The rotary 
movement is coupled to the S6 helix so as to open the pore. 
The idea of a crevice or gating pore around S4 is supported 
by experiments on sodium and potassium channels in which 
the charged argenine residues on the outer segment of the S4 
helix are replaced with much shorter residues, such as alanine 
or serine.21–23 These substitutions give rise to cationic currents 
(known as omega currents) through the closed channels, 
presumably by way of the gating pore.
The identification of a channel structure associated with 
inactivation was made first on potassium A-channels from 
Drosophila. Experiments on this channel provided evidence that 
a particular intracellular string of amino acids is associated with 
inactivation, and revived the ball-and-chain model of sodium 
channel inactivation that had been proposed more than a decade earlier by Armstrong 
and Bezanilla.24 In this model, a clump of amino acids (the ball) is tethered by a string of 
residues (the chain) to the main channel structure. Upon depolarization, the ball binds 
to a site in the inner vestibule of the channel, thereby blocking the pore (Figure 7.9). This 
model of inactivation was tested in potassium A-channels by examining the behavior of 
channels formed in oocytes from mutant subunits (recall that the A-channel is a tetramer 
rather than a single polypeptide). Mutations and deletions were made in the 80 or so amino 
acids between the amino terminus and the first (S1) membrane helix.25 Channels formed 
by mutant subunits with deletion of residues 6–46 showed virtually no inactivation, sug-
gesting that some or all of these residues were involved in the normal inactivation process. 
When a synthetic peptide matching the first 20 amino acids in the N-terminal chain was 
simply added to the solution bathing the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, inactivation 
was restored with a linear dose-dependence over the concentration range of 0 to 100 μM.26
This amazing observation provides unusually strong support for the idea that in potassium 
A-channel subunits, the first 20 or so amino acid residues constitute a blocking particle 
responsible for inactivation of the channel. Because it involves the N-terminal structure, 
this type of inactivation in potassium channels is often referred to as N-type inactivation.

Some potassium channels also display a much slower C-type inactiva-
tion, originally suspected to involve the C-terminal but later found to 
be related to structures near the outer mouth of the pore.27,28
Experiments with sodium channels have identified the intracel-
lular loop between domains III and IV as being closely involved in 
the inactivation process. The loop is about 45 residues in length, and 
is envisioned as a hairpin that swings into the inner vestibule of the 
channel to block the pore. In experiments with rat brain channels 
expressed in oocytes, three adjacent amino acid residues in the middle 
of the loop have been identified as essential for inactivation to occur.29
When they were removed or replaced by site-directed mutagenesis, inactivation was severely 
attenuated or abolished. Similar experiments also identified groups of glycine and proline 
residues at either end of the loop involved in inactivation. These are assumed to be hinge 
regions that allow the hairpin to flip into the vestibule.30 
Activation and Inactivation of Single Channels
The time course of activation and inactivation of the macroscopic sodium current shown 
in Figure 7.1 does not mirror the time course of current through a single channel. The 
responses of single channels to a depolarizing voltage step are shown in Figure 7.10. The 
records are from a cell-attached patch on a cultured rat muscle fiber that contained only 
a few active sodium channels.31 To remove any resting inactivation of sodium channels, a 
steady command potential was applied to the electrode, hyperpolarizing the patch membrane 
to –100 mV or so. In a series of successive trials, a 40 mV depolarizing pulse was applied 
to the electrode for about 20 ms, as shown in Figure 7.10B trace (a). In about one-third of 
the trial traces in (b), no sodium channels were activated. In the remainder, one or more 
single channel currents appeared during the pulse, occurring most frequently near the 
onset of depolarization. The mean channel current was 1.6 picoamperes (pA). Assuming

often in the initial 1–2 millisecond after the onset of the pulse, after 
which the probability of channel opening declines with the time con-
stant of inactivation. (After Sigworth and Neher, 1980.)

the sodium equilibrium potential to be +30 mV, the driving potential for sodium entry 
was about –90 mV; thus, the single-channel conductance was about 18 picosiemens (pS). 
This is comparable to sodium channel conductances measured in a variety of other cells. 
When 300 of the individual traces were added together (c), the summed current followed 
the same time course as that expected from the whole-cell sodium current. 
A major point of interest in Figure 7.10 is that the mean channel open time (0.7 ms) 
is short relative to the overall time course of the summed current. Specifically, the time 
constant of decay of the summed current (about 4 ms) does not reflect the length of time 
that individual channels remain open. Instead, it indicates a slow decay in the probability 
of channel opening. The processes of activation (m3) and inactivation (h) represent first 
an increase, and then a decrease in the probability that a channel will open for a brief 
period. Their product (m3h) describes the time course of the overall probability change. 
The probability increases rapidly near the beginning of the pulse, reaches a peak, and then 
decreases with time. In any given trial an individual channel may open immediately after 
the onset of the pulse, at any subsequent time during the pulse, or not at all.
Afterpotentials
One of the characteristics of the action potential in Figure 7.6B is that it is followed by 
a transient afterhyperpolarizing potential (AHP) that persists for several milliseconds be-
fore the membrane potential returns to its resting level. The AHP occurs because delayed 
rectifier channels continue to open for a period that outlasts the action potential, and the 
resulting increase in potassium conductance drives the membrane toward the potassium 
equilibrium potential. As the channel openings gradually cease, the membrane potential 
returns to its resting level. 
In addition to potassium channels associated with the delayed rectifier current, neurons 
have a number of potassium channel types whose activation contribute to the falling phase 
of the action potential and subsequent afterhyperolarization.32 The most prominent of these 
are calcium-activated potassium channels (see Chapter 5). During the action potential, 
calcium ions enter the cell through voltage-activated calcium channels (see next section) 
and produce increases in potassium conductance that contribute to both the repolarization 
and the subsequent hyperpolarizing potentials. This effect is illustrated in Figure 7.11. In 
Figure 7.11A, an action potential produced in a frog spinal motoneuron by a brief depolar-
izing current pulse is followed by two separate phases of hyperpolarization. The first is due 
to the persistent activation of delayed rectifier channels, as seen in Figure 7.6. The second, 
slower phase is due to potassium efflux through calcium-activated potassium channels and 
disappears after the preparation has been soaked in Ca2+-free solution (Figure 7.11B). The 
prolonged time course reflects the time taken for the cytoplasmic calcium concentration to 
return to its resting value. Short trains of action potentials have a cumulative effect on the 
size of the slow AHP, as successive impulses add additional increments to the intracellular 
calcium accumulation (Figure 7.11C).
The slow AHP is mediated primarily by potassium entry through so-called small K 
(SK) channels (see Chapter 5). Other potassium channels, known as big K (BK) are present 
in many neurons as well. These open very quickly and contribute to the rapid termination 
of the action potential in concert with delayed rectifier channels. 
Potassium ion fluxes associated with repolarization and hyperpolarization play an im-
portant role in regulating the frequency of ongoing action potential activity. An example is 
shown in Figure 7.11D,E. A steady current pulse applied to a vagal motoneuron depolarizes the 
membrane and produces a train of action potentials that gradually decreases in frequency and 
finally stops (D). Although not apparent in the record, the frequency adaptation and eventual 
cessation of activity occur because the depolarization produced by the applied current declines 
from its initial value, finally falling below threshold for excitation. This decrease in magnitude 
of the depolarization is because of a steady increase in potassium conductance produced by 
the ongoing increase in intracellular calcium concentration during the train. The increase in 
potassium conductance is apparent when the events are observed on a slower time scale—a 
large, slow AHP is seen to persist for several seconds after the end of the depolarizing pulse. 
When the same procedure is repeated with calcium entry blocked, the frequency 
adaptation and the prolonged AHP both disappear (Figure 7.11E). The frequency of the

ongoing train of action potentials is now determined by the interaction between the early 
AHP and the depolarizing current pulse. After each action potential, the increased potassium 
conductance repolarizes the membrane below threshold for action potential initiation; as 
the potassium conductance returns toward its resting level, depolarization by the current 
pulse is restored and another action potential is initiated. 
One additional factor can contribute to hyperpolarization and regulation of repetitive 
activity, namely the sodium–potassium exchange pump. The pump extrudes three sodium 
ions in exchange for two potassium ions and therefore contributes to the membrane 
potential (see Chapter 6). The rate of transport by the pump, and hence its contribution 
to the membrane potential, increases with increasing intracellular sodium concentration. 
Consequently, sodium accumulation during repetitive activity, particularly in small cells, 
can result in transient hyperpolarization that lasts until the excess sodium is extruded.33,34
Some neurons, for example cerebellar Purkinje cells, exhibit prolonged depolarization 
following the action potential.35,36 This afterdepolarizing potential (ADP) is associated with 
activation of a TTX-sensitive sodium current (INaP), which has a low threshold of activation 
and very slow inactivation.37
Just as calcium-activated potassium currents determine the magnitude and time course 
of the AHP, they also participate in regulating the ADP. After a single action potential 
or a short train of action potentials, the slow sodium current competes with potassium 
currents for control of the membrane potential. This interaction is illustrated in Figure 
7.12. With normal extracellular calcium concentration (2 mM) a brief depolarization 
applied to a rat hippocampal pyramidal cell produces a single action potential, followed 
by a prolonged ADP. When calcium influx during the action potential is decreased by 
reducing the external calcium concentration to 1.2 mM and then to zero, calcium influx 
and hence the calcium-activated potassium current is also reduced and the ADP becomes

larger. The increase in amplitude leads to a brief burst of action potentials in response 
to the single stimulus. Such bursting behavior, which is typical of a variety of cells in the 
central nervous system, is regulated by the interplay of sodium and potassium currents 
following the initial excitation.
There remains the question of how the afterdepolarizing potential is terminated, given 
the very slow inactivation of the sodium channels. Termination is accomplished by potas-
sium current through voltage-activated M-channels, which activate and inactivate slowly. 
M-channels are open at the resting potential and further activated by depolarization (see 
Chapter 6). Depolarization by the prolonged sodium current increases M-channel activa-
tion, and the resulting increase in outward potassium current repolarizes the membrane 
until activation of the sodium channels is removed.35
The channel isotype responsible for the prolonged sodium current in CA3 cells has not 
been identified, but it is known that they contain an abundance of SCNA8 (Nav6) channels.38
Cerebellar Purkinje cells also exhibit both prolonged sodium currents that produce ADPs 
and burst responses to single stimuli. These characteristics are disrupted in Purkinje cells 
from mutant mice in which SCNA8 channels are not expressed.39
The Role of Calcium in Excitation
Calcium Action Potentials 
The membranes of nerve and muscle fibers contain a variety of voltage-activated calcium 
channels (see Chapter 5 for calcium channel classifications and properties). Calcium ions 
enter the cell through these channels during the action potential, and this entry plays a key 
role in a variety of important processes. For example, a transient increase in intracellular 
calcium during the action potential is responsible for secretion of chemical transmitters 
by neurons and for contraction of muscle fibers. 
In some muscle fibers and some neurons, calcium currents become sufficiently large 
to contribute significantly to, or even be solely responsible for, the rising phase of the 
action potential. Because gCa increases with depolarization, the process is a regenerative 
one, entirely analogous to that discussed for sodium. Calcium action potentials were first 
studied in invertebrate muscle fibers by Fatt and Ginsborg40 and subsequently by Hagi-
wara.41 Calcium action potentials occur in cardiac muscle in a wide variety of invertebrate 
neurons and neurons in the vertebrate autonomic and central nervous systems.42 They 
also occur in immature neurons during development as well as in nonneural cells, such as 
endocrine cells and some invertebrate egg cells. The voltage-dependent calcium currents 
can be blocked by adding millimolar concentrations of cobalt, manganese, or cadmium to 
the extracellular bathing solution. Barium can substitute for calcium as the permeant ion, 
while magnesium cannot. A particularly striking example of the coexistence of sodium and 
calcium action potentials in the same cell is found in the mammalian cerebellar Purkinje 
cell, which generates sodium action potentials in its soma and calcium action potentials 
in the branches of its dendritic tree.43,44

becomes larger and initiates a second action 
potential. Reduction of external Ca2+ concentra-
tion to zero results in a further increase in the 
ADP. (After Golomb, Yue, and Yaari, 2006.)

Calcium Ions and Excitability 
Calcium ions also affect excitation. For instance, a reduction in extracellular calcium increases 
the excitability of nerve and muscle cells; conversely, increasing extracellular calcium decreases 
excitability. Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin45 used voltage clamp experiments to examine these 
effects in the squid axon and found that when extracellular calcium was reduced, the voltage 
dependence of sodium channel activation was shifted so that smaller depolarizing pulses were 
required to reach threshold and to produce sodium currents equivalent to those in normal 
solution. The reduction in depolarizing pulse amplitudes was constant throughout the range 
of excitation and depended on calcium concentration. A fivefold reduction in extracellular 
calcium resulted in a 10 mV to 15 mV reduction in the depolarization required for action 
potential initiation. The magnitude of the effect in this and in other nerve and muscle cells 
means that normal calcium levels are essential for maintaining a margin of safety between 
the resting potential and the threshold for action potential initiation.

SUMMARY
 
■
The action potential in most nerve cell membranes 
is produced by a transient increase in sodium 
conductance that drives the membrane potential toward 
the sodium equilibrium potential, which is then followed 
by an increase in potassium conductance that returns 
the membrane potential to its resting level.
 
■
The increases in conductance occur because sodium 
and potassium channels in the membrane are voltage 
dependent; that is, their opening probability increases 
with depolarization. 
 
■
Voltage clamp experiments on squid axons have provided 
detailed information about the voltage dependence and 
time course of the conductance changes. When the 
cell membrane is depolarized, the sodium conductance 
is activated rapidly and then inactivated. Potassium 
conductance is activated with a delay and remains high 
as long as the depolarization is maintained. 
 
■
The time and voltage dependence of the sodium and 
potassium conductance changes account precisely for 
the amplitude and time course of the action potential 
as well as for other phenomena, such as activation 
threshold and refractory period.
 
■
Activation of sodium and potassium conductances by 
depolarization requires, in theory, charge movements 
within the membrane. Appropriate charge movements, 
called gating currents, have been measured. 
 
■
Calcium plays an important role in excitation. In 
some cells calcium influx, rather than sodium influx, 
is responsible for the rising phase of the action 
potential. Extracellular calcium also controls membrane 
excitability, which increases with decreasing calcium 
concentration.

■ CHAPTER 8
Electrical Signaling 
in Neurons
I
n order to understand how signals are transmitted from one place to another in the nervous 
system it is necessary to know how they are generated in individual neurons and how they 
spread from one region of the cell to the next. Small depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signals 
spread passively along a nerve axon or dendrite, decreasing in amplitude over a short distance. 
The amplitude attenuation depends on a number of factors, principally the diameter and mem-
brane properties of the fiber. Signals spread farther along a fiber with a large diameter and high 
membrane resistance. The electrical capacitance of the membrane influences both the time 
course and spatial spread of the electrical signal. Larger depolarizations give rise to action poten-
tials. Once initiated, action potentials are regenerative and self-propagating, so they travel from 
their point of origin over the full length of the nerve process with no loss of amplitude. 
The axons of many vertebrate nerve cells are covered by a high-resistance, low-capacitance 
myelin sheath. This sheath acts as an effective insulator and forces currents associated with the 
nerve impulse to flow through the membrane where the sheath is interrupted (nodes of Ranvier). 
The impulse jumps from one such node to the next and thereby its conduction velocity is in-
creased. In addition, electrical activity can pass between neurons through specialized regions of 
close membrane apposition called gap junctions. Intercellular channels, called connexons, provide 
pathways for current flow through gap junctions. 

130 Chapter 8
In this chapter we consider how electrical signals are transmitted along the processes of 
neurons. Small depolarizing or hyperpolarizing signals, generated locally in an axon or 
dendrite, die out over a relatively short distance. These signals occur in sensory recep-
tors and in postsynaptic regions of neurons. If local depolarizations are sufficiently large, 
they produce action potentials that rise transiently to many times the amplitude of the 
initial signal. Action potentials are self-propagating and spread from their point of origin 
throughout the entire neuronal process without loss of amplitude. The spread of both lo-
cal potentials and action potentials depend on the passive electrical properties of the cell. 
We begin by considering current flow across the membrane of a simple spherical 
cell. In the experiment illustrated in Figure 8.1A, two microelectrodes are inserted into 
the cell, one to pass current across the membrane and the other to record the resulting 
change in membrane potential. A positive current pulse produces a depolarization that 
rises gradually to its final value and then dissipates after termination of the pulse (Figure 
8.1B). Two questions arise from this kind of experiment: (1) What determines the size of 
the potential change? (2) What determines the rate of rise and fall of the potentials at the 
beginning and end of the current? 
To answer these questions, it is useful to refer to the electrical model of the cell shown in 
Figure 8.1C. The input resistance of the cell, rinput, represents the pathway for current flow 
across the cell membrane. Input resistance is the inverse of the input conductance of the 
cell (rinput = 1/ginput), which in turn is made up of the sum of the membrane conductances 
to sodium, potassium, chloride, and other ions, lumped into a single pathway. The capaci-
tor (cinput) represents the input capacitance of the cell, and is the electrical equivalent of 
the charged layers on the extracellular and intracellular surfaces of the lipid membrane. 
Its capacitance is determined by the electrical insulating properties and thickness of the 
membrane lipid. The battery,V, represents the resting membrane potential. 
In considering the size of the potential change, it is useful to recall Ohm’s law: a given 
amount of current, i, passed through a resistor, r, produces a voltage v = ir (see Appendix 
A). In the case of our spherical cell, the input resistance of the cell determines the maximum 
amplitude finally reached during the voltage change (ΔVmax). So, we can write:
ΔVmax = irinput
The rise of the change in potential is slowed because the cell membrane has an input 
capacitance. To understand its effect, it is necessary to recall that the charge on the capacitor, 
q, varies with potential, V, according to the relation q = cV (see Appendix A). This means that 
a membrane potential change must be accompanied by a corresponding change in the charge 
stored in the membrane capacitance. At the beginning of the current pulse, only a fraction of 
the current flows across the input resistance to produce a change in potential. The remainder 
is diverted to the capacitor in order to alter its charge. Initially, the rate of change of potential is 
relatively rapid and a capacitative current is relatively large. At the end of the pulse the potential 
change has reached its final value, the capacitor is fully charged to the new level, and all of the 
current flows through the resistor. After the current pulse is terminated the potential returns 
slowly to its original level as current drains off the capacitor through the resistor. 
The rise of the membrane potential change follows an exponential time course, its time 
dependence being described by the relation ΔVm = ΔVmax(1 – e–t/τ), where τ is the input 
time constant of the membrane, and the time, t, is measured from the onset of the pulse.

Electrical Signaling in Neurons 131
Similarly, when the current pulse is terminated, the potential change decays exponentially 
to zero: ΔVm = ΔVmaxe–t/τ. The input time constant is given by the product of the input 
resistance and the input capacitance: τ = rinputcinput.
Specific Electrical Properties of Cell Membranes
The input resistance and capacitance of the spherical cell depend not only on the resistive 
and capacitive properties of the cell membrane but also on the size of the cell. The specific 
capacitance of the membrane (Cm) is the capacitance of one square centimeter of mem-
brane. The input capacitance of a spherical cell is given simply by the capacitance per unit 
area times the surface area of the cell: cinput = Cm (4πr2). The larger the cell, the greater the 
input capacitance. Typically, cell membranes have capacitances of the order of 1 μF/cm2
(1μF = 10–6 farads ; see Appendix A for definitions of electrical constants). This means 
that at a resting potential of –80 mV the amount of charge stored on the inner surface of 
the membrane (q = CmV) is (1 × 10–6F) × (80 × 10–3V) = 8 × 10–8 coulombs/cm2, which is 
5 × 1011 univalent ions (0.8 picomole [pmol]) for each square centimeter.
Similarly, the specific resistance of the membrane (Rm) is the resistance of one square 
centimeter of membrane. However, its relation to input resistance is reversed: In general, 
a large cell has more ionic channels in its membrane than a small cell, and therefore will 
have a lower resistance to the flow of ionic current. In other words, the input resistance 
of a cell is inversely related to membrane area. For a spherical cell: rinput = Rm/(4πr2). For 
this reason, Rm has the units Ωcm2. Measurements of the specific resistance of a variety 
of neuronal membranes range from less than 1,000 Ωcm2 for membranes with a large 
number of active ion channels to more than 50,000 Ωcm2 for membranes with relatively 
few such channels. Suppose we select a value of 2000 Ωcm2, which is equivalent to 5 ×
108 pS/cm2; then, if the average open membrane channel has a conductance of 50 pico-
siemens (pS), the number of open channels in the resting membrane at any given time 
would be 107/cm2. The input time constant, being the product of the input resistance 
and the input capacitance, is independent of cell size and is equal to the time constant 
of the membrane: τm = RmCm. 
Flow of Current in a Nerve Fiber
The effects of injecting a pulse of current into a nerve fiber, such as an axon or a dendrite, 
are more complex than those seen in a simple spherical cell because the membrane is 
extended to enclose a cylinder and can no longer be represented by a single resistor and 
capacitor. In addition, because current injected into a fiber not only flows outward through 
the membrane but also spreads longitudinally along the core of the fiber, the response is 
affected by the electrical properties of the cytoplasm. 
Figure 8.2A shows an experimental arrangement for measuring the response of a nerve 
fiber to current injection through a microelectrode. As with the spherical cell, a second 
electrode is used to measure the response, but this time it is withdrawn repeatedly and 
reinserted to measure the voltage change at increasing distances from the current-passing 
electrode. The results of such a set of measurements are shown in Figure 8.2B. The potential 
change near the point of current injection (0 mm from the current electrode) is relatively 
large and rises rapidly to its final value. As we move farther and farther from the current 
electrode, the potentials become smaller and slower. Potentials produced in this way are 
known as electrotonic potentials.
The final amplitudes of the electrotonic potentials are plotted against distance from the 
current-passing electrode in Figure 8.2C. The amplitudes fall exponentially with distance 
according to the relation:
ΔV = ΔV0e–x/λ
where x is the distance from the current source and λ is the length constant of the fiber. 
The voltage change at zero separation is proportional to the size of the injected current:
ΔV0 = irinput 
where rinput is the input resistance of the fiber. 

132 Chapter 8
In summary, two factors, rinput and λ, determine both the size of the response to 
current injection and how far the signal will spread along the fiber. To illustrate how 
these two factors depend on the properties of the fiber, it is again convenient to refer 
to an electrical model, shown in Figure 8.2D. The model is obtained by imagining that 
the fiber is cut along its length into a series of short cylinders. The membrane resistance 
of each cylindrical segment is represented by the resistor rm, its capacitance by cm, and 
the membrane potential by the battery Vm. The internal pathway for ion flow along the 
axoplasm from the midpoint of one cylinder to the next is represented by the resistor ri.
Because nerves in a recording chamber are normally bathed in a large volume of fluid, 
resistance along the outside of the cylinders is represented as being zero. This approxi-
mation is not always adequate in the central nervous system (CNS), where nerve axons, 
dendrites, and glial cells are closely packed, thereby causing pathways for extracellular 
current flow to be restricted. Any length can be selected for the cylinders themselves; 
however, by convention, the resistances rm and ri  and the capacitance cm are specified 
for a 1-cm length of axon. Their relations to the specific properties of the membrane 
and cytoplasm are given in Box 8.1. This type of analysis was first used to examine the 
electrical behavior of undersea cables, and the parameters rm, cm, and ri are sometimes 
referred to as “cable properties.” 
FIGURE 8.2 Response to Current Injection recorded from a nerve fiber immersed in bathing

Electrical Signaling in Neurons 133
Current injected into the fiber flows spreads longitudinally along the fiber away from 
the tip of the electrode; as it does so, some of it is lost by ions moving laterally through the 
membrane. The distance the potential spreads depends on the relative ease with which ions 
carrying the current escape through the cell membrane, as compared with the ease of ion 
movement through the cytoplasm. If the membrane resistance is low relative to that of the 
cytoplasm, then current will leak outward through the membrane before it can spread very 
far. A higher resistance membrane, on the other hand, will allow a greater portion of the 
current to spread laterally before escaping to the external solution. So the length constant 
increases as membrane resistance increases, and decreases when the internal longitudinal 
resistance increases. The exact relation is given by:

The input resistance depends on the resistance encountered by current flowing from the 
point of injection back into the extracellular fluid. Because the pathways for current flow 
include both ri and rm, both contribute to the input resistance:
rinput= 0.5 (rmri)½ 
The factor 0.5 appears because the fiber extends in both directions from the point of cur-
rent injection; each half has a resistance (rmri)½.
In general, large processes have greater length constants than small ones. This is because 
the membrane resistance depends on the surface area of the fiber and therefore varies inversely 
with fiber diameter, whereas the internal resistance depends on cross-sectional area and 
varies inversely with the square of the diameter. So as fiber diameter increases, ri decreases 
more rapidly than rm and the ratio rm/ri increases. Conversely, large processes have a lower 
input resistance than small processes because both the input resistance and longitudinal 
resistances are smaller (see Box 8.1). Other properties being equal, an excitatory synaptic 
potential (see Chapter 11) will be smaller in a large dendritic process (smaller rinput) than 
in a small one. On the other hand, in a larger dendrite the synaptic potential will spread 
farther toward the cell body (larger λ).
In axons and dendrites, the rates of rise and fall of electrotonic potentials depend on 
both the membrane time constant (τ = rmcm) and the internal longitudinal resistance, but 
do not follow an exponential time course. At the onset of the pulse current flows rapidly 
into nearby membrane capacitors, but then slows as an increasingly larger fraction of 
the current is diverted to longitudinal flow through the cytoplasm. The potentials rise 
much more slowly at points distant from the current electrode than at points nearby 
■  BOX 8.1 
Relation between Cable Constants and Specific Membrane Properties
The cable parameters rm, cm, and ri refer to a 1-cm length 
of fiber. The first two parameters, rm and cm, depend on the 
specific resistance and capacitance of the fiber membrane 
and, in addition, on fiber diameter. The capacitance cm has the 
units μF/cm. Its relation to the specific membrane capacitance 
is given by cm = Cm (2πa), with 2πa being the surface area of 
a unit length of fiber of radius a. The resistance rm, which has 
the units Ωcm, is related to the specific membrane resistance 
by rm = Rm/(2πa). 
The internal longitudinal resistance, ri, is expressed as Ω/
cm, and is related to the specific resistance of the cytoplasm, 
ρ, by ri = ρ/(πa2). The specific resistance depends, in turn, on 
the intracellular ion concentrations and mobilities. The specific 
resistance of squid axoplasm is about 30 Ωcm at 20°C, or 
about 107 times that of copper. In mammals, in which the cy-
toplasmic ion concentration is lower, the specific resistance is 
about 125 Ω cm at 37°C; in frogs, with still lower ion concen-
tration, the specific resistance is about 250 Ω cm at 20°C.
The relations given above can be used to deduce the de-
pendence on fiber diameter of the input resistance and length 
constant. Thus, the input resistance is:

because the internal longitudinal resistance reduces the current flowing into the more 
distant capacitors. 
Action Potential Propagation
Once generated, action potentials typically propagate along the entire length of a nerve fiber 
without attenuation. This propagation depends on the passive spread of current ahead of 
the active region to depolarize the next segment of membrane to threshold. To illustrate the 
nature of the current flow involved in impulse generation and propagation, we can imagine 
the action potential frozen at an instant in time and plot its spatial distribution along a 
fiber, as shown in Figure 8.3. The distance occupied depends on the duration of the action 
potential and the rate of conduction along the fiber. For example, if the action potential 
duration is 2 milliseconds (ms) and if it is conducted at 10 meters per second (m/s), or 
10 mm/ms, then the potential will be spread over a 20 mm length of axon (almost an 
inch). Near the leading edge of the action potential, the cell membrane is depolarized by 
a rapid influx of sodium ions along their concentration gradient. Just as when current is 
injected through a microelectrode, the inward current spreads longitudinally through the 
axoplasm. Current spread ahead of the active region causes a new segment of membrane 
to be polarized toward threshold. Behind the peak of the action potential the potassium 
conductance is high and current flows out through potassium channels, returning the 
membrane potential toward its resting level.
Normally, impulses arise at one end of an axon and travel to the other. However, there 
is no inherent directionality to propagation. Impulses produced in the middle of a muscle 
fiber at a neuromuscular junction travel away from the junction in both directions toward 
the tendons. However, except in unusual circumstances, an action potential cannot double 
back on itself, reversing its direction of propagation. This is because the peak depolarization 
is followed by a refractory period during which re-excitation cannot occur (see Chapter 7). 
During this period, sodium channels remain inactivated, and the potassium conductance 
is still high, so that even if sodium channels were active depolarization would be difficult. 
Because of the refractory period the active region of the membrane, as it moves along fiber, 
is followed by a refractory region that cannot be re-excited. 
As the membrane potential returns to its resting value, 
sodium channel inactivation is removed, potassium 
conductance returns to normal, and excitability recovers.
The rate of propagation of the action potential is in-
fluenced by both the space constant and time constant of 
the fiber. If the time constant is small, the membrane will 
depolarize to threshold quickly and the conduction velocity 
will be relatively high. If the space constant is large, the 
depolarization will spread a correspondingly large distance 
ahead of the active region, again speeding propagation of the 
signal. The result is that large fibers conduct more rapidly 
than small fibers because of their larger space constants. As 
already noted, the membrane time constant is independent 
of fiber size. Numerically, conduction velocity increases 
with the square root of fiber diameter. 
Myelinated Nerves and 
Saltatory Conduction 
In the vertebrate nervous system, the larger nerve fibers 
are myelinated. Myelin is formed in the periphery by 
Schwann cells and in the CNS by oligodendrocytes (see 
Chapter 10). The cells wrap themselves tightly around 
axons, and with each wrap the cytoplasm in between the 
membrane pair is squeezed out so that the result is a spiral 
of tightly packed membranes. The number of wrappings 
(lamellae) ranges from a low of between 10 and 20 to a

Rapid depolarization on the rising phase of the action potential is due to influx 
of positively charged sodium ions. The positive current spreads ahead of the 
impulse to depolarize the adjacent segment of membrane toward threshold. 
Efflux of potassium ions behind the peak leads to repolarization.

maximum of about 160. In this way the effective membrane resistance is greatly increased 
and the membrane capacitance reduced. The myelin sheath usually occupies 20% to 40% 
of the overall diameter of the fiber and is interrupted periodically by nodes of Ranvier, 
exposing narrow patches of axonal membrane.1 The internodal distance is usually about 
100 times the external diameter of the fiber and ranges from 200 μm to 2 mm. 
The effect of the myelin sheath is to restrict membrane current flow largely to the 
nodes, because ions cannot flow easily into or out of the high-resistance internodal region 
and the internodal capacitative currents are very small as well. As a result excitation jumps 
from node to node, thereby greatly increasing the conduction velocity. Such impulse 
propagation is called saltatory conduction (from Latin saltare, to jump, leap or dance). 
Saltatory conduction does not mean that the action potential occurs in only one node at 
time. While excitation is jumping from one node to the next on the leading edge of the 
action potential, many nodes behind are still active. Myelinated axons not only conduct 
more rapidly than unmyelinated ones but also are capable of firing at higher frequencies 
for more prolonged periods of time.
Conduction velocities of myelinated fibers vary from a few meters per second up to more 
than 100 m/s. The world speed record is held by myelinated axons of the shrimp, which 
conduct at speeds in excess of 200 m/s (447 miles/hour).2 In the vertebrate nervous system, 
peripheral nerves have been classified into groups according to conduction, velocity, and 
function (Box 8.2). Theoretical calculations suggest that in myelinated fibers conduction 
velocity should be proportional to the diameter of the fiber. In mammals large myelinated 
fibers (>11 μm in diameter) have a conduction velocity in meters per second equal to 
■  BOX 8.2
Classification of Vertebrate Nerve Fibers
If we use external electrodes to stimulate all the fibers in a 
peripheral nerve at one end and then record its electrical 
response some distance away the record will have a series 
of peaks. The peaks occur because of dispersion of nerve 
impulses that travel at different velocities in different fibers, and 
therefore arrive at the recording electrode at different times 
after the stimulus. For example, a record taken from a rat 
sciatic nerve with 50 mm between the stimulating and record-
ing electrode might look like the following (the rapid deflection 
at the beginning is an artifact due to current spread from the 
stimulating electrode):
Vertebrate nerve fibers were classified into groups on the 
basis of differences in conduction velocity, combined with 
differences in function. Unfortunately, two such classifications 
arose independently. In the first system, group A refers to my-
elinated fibers in peripheral nerve; in mammals, these conduct 
at velocities ranging from 5 to 120 m/s. Group A fibers were 
further subdivided according to conduction velocity into α 
(80–120 m/s), β (30–80 m/s), and δ (5–30 m/s). These con-
duction velocity peaks are indicated in the record. The term 
γ fibers is reserved for motor nerves supplying muscle spin-
dles (see Chapter 24), which have conduction velocities that 
span the β and lower part of the α range. Group B consists of 
myelinated fibers in the autonomic nervous system that have 
conduction velocities in the lower part of the A-fiber range. 
Group C refers to unmyelinated fibers, which conduct very 
slowly (less than 2 m/s). 
The second nomenclature is used to classify to sensory 
fibers arising in muscle: Group I, corresponding to Aα, Group 
II to Aβ, and Group III to Aδ. Group I afferent fibers were fur-
ther classified into two subgroups, depending on whether they 
conveyed information from muscle spindles (Ia) or from sen-
sory receptors in tendons (Ib) (see Chapters 19 and 24). 
Fiber size affects other electrical properties of nerves 
in addition to conduction velocity. When a nerve trunk is 
stimulated with external electrodes, large fibers are excited 
more readily than small ones (i.e., their excitation threshold is 
lower). This is fortunate for clinical purposes, as it allows test-
ing of thresholds and conduction velocity in motor nerves, for 
example, without exciting much smaller pain fibers. Just as 
larger fibers are easier to excite, they are also harder to block, 
for example by cooling or by local anesthetic, which means 
that pain fibers can be blocked without interfering with con-
duction in larger motor and sensory fibers. One exception to 
this general rule is block by localized pressure for which large 
axons are affected first, then smaller ones, as the pressure is 
increased.

proportionality is about 4.5.3
Distribution of Channels in Myelinated Fibers 
In myelinated fibers, voltage-sensitive sodium channels are highly concentrated in the nodes 
of Ranvier, with potassium channels more concentrated under the paranodal sheath.4 The 
properties of the axon membrane in the paranodal regions normally covered by myelin 
were examined by Ritchie and his colleagues by loosening the myelin with enzyme treat-
ment or osmotic shock.5 Voltage clamp studies were then made of currents in the region 
of the node and compared with those obtained before the treatment. Previous experiments 
had suggested that, in rabbit nerve, nodes of Ranvier normally display only inward sodium 
current upon excitation. Repolarization after sodium channel inactivation appeared not to 
involve a transient increase in potassium conductance (as in other cells considered so far) 
but instead only passive current flow though a relatively large resting conductance. When 
the axon membrane adjacent to the nodes (the paranodal region) was exposed, excitation 
then produced a delayed outward potassium current, with no increase in inward current, 
indicating that the newly exposed membrane contained delayed rectifier channels but not 
sodium channels. Later immunocytochemical studies on rat myelinated nerve confirmed 
that delayed rectifier potassium channels (Kv1.1 and Kv1.2) were confined to the paranodal 
region (Figure 8.4A).6,7 
In the meantime, further voltage clamp experiments revealed that the potassium cur-
rent underlying repolarization at intact nodes had more complex features than expected of 
passive ion flux through resting channels—most notably a slowly inactivating component, 
labeled IKs.8,9 A clue to the nature of the slowly inactivating current was provided by the 
observation that mutations that impair the function of the potassium channel subunit 
KCNQ2 cause neuronal hyperexcitability, manifested by epileptic seizures and by involuntary 
muscle contractions (myokymia caused by spontaneous discharges in peripheral motor 
axons).10 KCNQ2 (Kv7.2) combines with other members of the KCNQ family to form the 
voltage-sensitive channels underlying the M-current (see Chapter 17). M-channels are 
activated by depolarization and inactivate very slowly. Their activation threshold is such

that a fraction of the population is open at rest. Subsequent immunohistochemical studies 
confirmed that KCNQ2 subunits are expressed at nodes of Ranvier in rat sciatic nerve as 
well as at nodes and initial segments of myelinated CNS fibers.11 In addition, voltage clamp 
studies on rat peripheral nerve fibers have shown that the IKs currents have all the biophysical 
and pharmacological properties of M-currents.12 It is now apparent the M-channels are an 
important regulator of neuronal excitability throughout the nervous system. At nodes of 
Ranvier they serve to prevent spontaneous (ectopic) action potential discharges or repetitive 
discharges following invasion by a single action potential,12 while at axon initial segments 
they regulate action potential threshold to suppress spontaneous firing.13
Mammalian axons that have been demyelinated chronically by exposure to diphtheria 
toxin can develop continuous conduction through a demyelinated region, suggesting that after 
demyelination, voltage-activated sodium channels appear in the exposed axon membrane.14
Labeling of demyelinated nerves with antibodies to sodium channels shows that channels 
disappear from clusters in the former nodal regions and that new channels are distributed 
along previously myelinated regions (Figure 8.4B). Voltage-activated potassium channels 
are redistributed as well.15 Upon remyelination there is restoration of normal clustering of 
sodium and potassium channels in newly formed nodes and paranodal regions. 
Geometry and Conduction Block
A simple unmyelinated axon with uniform membrane properties is not representative 
of an entire neuron, with its cell body, elaborate dendritic arborization, and numerous 
axonal branches. The complex geometry of the neuron provides many possibilities for 
blocking action potential propagation. Specifically, propagation may fail wherever there is 
an abrupt expansion of membrane area. In such a situation the active membrane may not 
be able to provide enough current to depolarize the larger membrane area to threshold. 
For example, where an axon divides into two branches the safety factor for propagation 
is reduced because current from the active segment of the single axon must contribute 
sufficient current to depolarize both branches to threshold. Under normal circumstances 
an impulse will usually propagate into both branches, but after repeated firing propaga-
tion may become blocked at the branch point. Other factors contribute to such block. For 
instance, in leech sensory cells, block can occur because of persistent hyperpolarization 
induced by increased electrogenic activity of the sodium pump (see Chapter 9), and long 
lasting increases in potassium permeability, both of which increase the amount of current 
required for depolarization to threshold.16,17
In myelinated peripheral nerve the safety factor for conduction is about 5; that is, the 
depolarization produced at a node by excitation of a preceding node is approximately 5 
times larger than necessary to reach threshold. Again, this safety factor is reduced where 
branching occurs. Similarly, when the myelin sheath terminates, for example near the 
end of a motor nerve, the current from the last node is then distributed over a large area 
of unmyelinated nerve terminal membrane and, as a consequence, provides less overall 
depolarization than would occur at a node. It is advantageous that the last few internodes 
before an unmyelinated terminal are shorter than normal, so that more nodes contribute 
to depolarization of the terminal.
Conduction in Dendrites
Apart from considerations of geometry, some regions of the neuron have a lower threshold 
for action potential initiation than others. This was first observed in spinal motoneurons by 
J. C. Eccles and his colleagues.18 They found that upon depolarization action potentials were 
initiated first in the axon hillock, where the initial segment of the axon joins the cell body, 
and then propagated both outward along the axon and back into the soma and dendrites 
of the cell. At about the same time, Kuffler and Eyzaguirre found that depolarization of 
the dendrites in the crayfish stretch receptor initiated action potentials in or near the cell 
body, rather than in the dendrites themselves.19 Observations of this kind led to the idea 
that dendrites were generally inexcitable and served only to transmit signals passively from 
dendritic synapses to the initial segment of the axon. This idea arose in spite of numerous 
observations to the contrary. For example, earlier extracellular recordings of electrical ac-

tivity within the mammalian motor cortex by Li and Jasper gave clear indication of action 
potentials traveling upward along pyramidal cell dendrites from their cell bodies to the 
cortical surface, with a conduction velocity of about 3 m/s.20
Dendritic action potentials are now known to occur in a variety of neurons, and are 
mediated by regenerative sodium and calcium currents. Cerebellar Purkinje cells, in addi-
tion to producing sodium action potentials in their somatic region, generate calcium action 
potentials in their dendrites.21 As shown in Figure 8.5A, calcium action potentials generated in 
a dendrite spread effectively into the soma. Somatic action potentials, on the other hand, are 
not propagated into the dendrites but spread passively a short distance into the dendritic tree. 
Like Purkinje cells, cortical pyramidal cells exhibit sodium action potentials in their 
somatic regions, usually arising in the initial segment of the axon. In addition, regenerative 
calcium potentials are observed in the distal dendrite.22,23 Responses of a pyramidal cell to 
depolarization of the distal dendrite by activation of excitatory synapses (see Chapter 11) 
are shown in Figure 8.5B. Modest synaptic activation (a) produces dendritic depolarization

(A) Records from a cerebellar Purkinje cell, obtained by impal-
ing the cell at the indicated locations and passing a depolariz-
ing current through the electrode. Near the end of the dendrit-
ic tree (a) depolarization produces long duration calcium action 
potentials. In the cell soma (d) a steady depolarizing current 
produced high-frequency sodium action potentials, interrupted 
periodically by calcium action potentials. At intermediate loca-
tions (b,c) depolarization produces calcium action potentials in 
the dendrite. Accompanying sodium action potentials gener-
ated in the soma spread passively into the dendritic tree and 
die out after a short distance. (B) Conduction in a cortical py-
ramidal cell. A cortical cell dendrite is depolarized by activating 
distal excitatory synapses. (a) Moderate depolarization of the 
dendrite spreads to the soma, where it initiates an action po-
tential (blue record). In the dendrite, the initial depolarization is 
larger, and is followed by an action potential that spreads back 
from the soma (red record). (b) Larger depolarization produces 
a calcium action potential in the dendrite that precedes action 
potential initiation in the soma. (A after Llinás and Sugimori,

that is attenuated as it spreads passively toward the soma. Upon arrival, the depolarization 
produces a somatic action potential that then spreads back into the dendrite. Stronger syn-
aptic depolarization (b) results in direct activation of a dendritic calcium action potential 
that precedes the action potential generated in the soma. 
Although there is now ample evidence of regenerative activity in dendrites, the general 
principle that the axon hillock is the most excitable region of the cell still holds for most 
types of neurons that have been examined.24 Propagation of electrical signals in a dendrite 
is clearly more complex than in an axon.25 Dendrites are likely to contain a variety of 
voltage-dependent channels in addition to those associated with the action potential, and 
the coexistence of action potentials and synaptic potentials in the dendritic tree add still 
more complexity. For example, the safety factor for backpropagation of action potentials 
will depend on the input resistance of the various branches; the input resistances, in turn, 
will depend on the extent of activity at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Thus, whether 
or not backpropagation occurs depends on synaptic activity.26–28 At the same time, synaptic 
channels that are voltage-dependent will behave differently from one moment to the next, 
depending on whether backpropagation has occurred.29 These factors add new dimensions 
to signal processing that are only beginning be understood. 
Pathways for Current Flow between Cells
In most circumstances an action potential arriving at a nerve terminal has little or no direct 
electrical influence on the next cell. Currents generated by the action potential flow preferen-
tially through the low-resistance extracellular space. Contact between cells is usually limited to 
a small area of apposition, and the resistances of the small areas of membrane are far too high 
to allow any significant current flow between the cells. Certain cells, however, are electrically 
coupled. These include cardiac and smooth muscle cells, epithelial cells, gland cells, and a vari-
ety of neurons. Here we describe special intercellular structures that allow the processes of one 
neuron to be in electrical continuity with the next, thereby allowing current flow between them. 
The specific properties and functional role of electrical synapses are discussed in Chapter 11. 
At sites of electrical coupling the intercellular current flows through gap junctions. 
The gap junction is a region of close apposition of two cells characterized by aggregates of 
particles distributed in corresponding arrays in each of the adjoining membranes (Figure 
8.6A,B). Each particle, called a connexon, is comprised of six protein subunits arranged in 
a circle, about 10 nm in diameter, around a central core. Identical particles in the apposing 
cells are exactly paired to span the 3.5-nm gap in the region of contact. 
About 20 connexon subunits (connexins) have been isolated, ranging in weight from 26 
to 57 kilodaltons (kD).30,31 Each was named according to its deduced weight; for example, 
Cx32 (32 kD), found in rat liver, Cx40, in heart muscle, and so on. Connexons can be as-
sembled from one type of connexin (homomeric) or more than one (heteromeric), and 
an intercellular channel can be formed from two identical connexons (homotypic) or two 
different connexons (heterotypic). The primary amino acid sequence of the connexins 
indicates that the molecule is composed of four transmembrane helices, M1–M4, connected 
by one intracellular and two extracellular loops (Figure 8.6C). This structure has been 
confirmed by electron crystallographic studies on Cx43.32 A study with high-resolution 
(3.5Å) crystallography has provided a detailed image of the molecular structure of the 
entire Cx26 intercellular channel.33 The molecule has an outer diameter of 9 nm at the 
cytoplasmic ends, tapering to a minimum of 5 nm in the middle of the extracellular bridge. 
The open pore has a diameter of 3.5 nm at each entrance, narrowing to 1.4 nm at the outer 
faces of the membranes and widening to 2.5 nm in the intercellular region (Figure 8.6D). 
M1 is the major pore-lining helix. In the intercellular region, the E1 and E2 loops of each 
connexin form a tight, double-layered ring around the channel interior with six copies of 
the n-terminal half of E1 lining the pore. The two rings interdigitate in the center of the 
cleft with an overlap of about 6 nm.
Conductance and permeability of the connexons have been studied extensively, both as 
hemichannels expressed in individual host cells, such as Xenopus oocytes, and as complete 
gap junction channels expressed in paired cells.23,24 Complete channels allow passage of 
molecules up to about 1 nm in diameter and 1,000 Daltons in molecular mass. However, 
molecular selectivity and conductance vary widely depending on subunit composition.34

For example, Cx43 channels are more than 100 times more permeable to adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) and 40 times more permeable to glutamate than are Cx32 channels. 
Channel conductance is also highly variable, ranging from 15 pS for Cx36 channels to 300 
pS for Cx43 in normal physiological solutions.
Even with the lowest single-channel conductance, individual gap junctions provide a 
significant pathway for current flow between cells because of the high packing density of 
the channels. For example, a tight junction 0.2 µm in diameter may contain more than 300 
connexon pairs.35 At 15 pS each, the total conductance through the junction would be 4.5 
nanosiemens (nS). This is several thousand times greater than the conductance through 
two tightly apposed cell membranes with the same area and no connexons.

SUMMARY
 
■
The spread of local graded potentials in a neuron and 
the propagation of action potentials along a nerve fiber 
depend on the electrical properties of the cytoplasm 
and the cell membrane.
 
■
When a steady current is injected into a cylindrical fiber, 
the size of a local graded potential is determined by 
the input resistance of the fiber (rinput) and the distance 
over which it spreads is determined by the length 
constant of the fiber (λ); rinput and λ depend, in turn, 
on the resistance of the fiber membrane (rm) and the 
longitudinal resistance of the axoplasm (ri). 
 
■
In addition to having a resistance, a nerve fiber 
membrane has a capacitance. The effect of the 
membrane capacitance (cm) is to slow the rise and 
decay of signals. The magnitude of this effect is 
determined by the membrane time constant, τ = rmcm.
 
■
Propagation of an action potential along a fiber 
depends on the passive spread of current from the 
active region into the next segment of membrane. The 
conduction velocity depends on the time constant and 
length constant of the membrane and is proportional to 
fiber diameter.
 
■
Large nerve fibers in vertebrates are wrapped in myelin 
sheaths, with regularly spaced gaps or nodes between 
ensheathing glia or Schwann cells. During action 
potential propagation, excitation jumps from one node 
to the next (saltatory conduction). 
 
■
Action potential propagation is influenced by 
geometrical factors that produce changes in membrane 
area. For example, block of propagation may occur 
at branch points in nerve terminal arborizations, and 
conduction may have a preferred direction in tapered 
dendrites. 
 
■
Transfer of electrical signals from one cell to the next 
requires special low-resistance connections called 
gap junctions. A gap junction is formed by a collection 
of connexons, which are proteins that form aqueous 
channels between the cytoplasms of adjacent cells. 


■ CHAPTER 9
Ion Transport across 
Cell Membranes
T
here is a constant flux of ions across the plasma membrane of neurons, both at rest and 
during electrical activity. The flux is driven by electrical and chemical concentration gradi-
ents. In the face of such movements, concentrations in the cytoplasm are kept constant 
by transport mechanisms that use energy to move ions back across the membrane against their 
electrochemical gradients. Maintenance of intracellular ion concentrations is essential to maintain 
both the resting membrane potential and the ability to generate electrical signals. 
Primary active transport uses energy provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate 
(ATP). The most prevalent transport mechanism of this kind is the sodium–potassium exchange 
pump. The molecule responsible for transport is an enzyme, sodium–potassium ATPase, which 
carries three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions in, for every molecule of ATP 
hydrolyzed. Each cycle of the pump results in the net movement of one ionic charge across the 
membrane, so the pump is said to be electrogenic. Two different forms of calcium ATPase are 
responsible for calcium transport out of the cytoplasm: plasma membrane calcium ATPase pumps 
calcium out of the cell, and endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPases pump calcium from 
the cytoplasm into intracellular compartments. 
Secondary active transport uses the movement of sodium down its electrochemical gradient 
to transport other ions across the membrane either in the same direction (cotransport) or in the 
opposite direction (ion exchange). An example is sodium–calcium exchange, in which the influx of 
three sodium ions is used to transport a single calcium ion out of the cell. Like all other transport 
systems, this exchange system is reversible, and depending on the chemical and electrical gradi-
ents for the two ions, it can be made to run in a forward or backward direction. A second sodium–
calcium exchange system, found in retinal cells, transports a single calcium ion plus one potas-
sium ion out of the cell in exchange for four sodium ions. Sodium influx is also utilized to transport 
chloride and bicarbonate across the cell membrane. All such mechanisms provide pathways for 
sodium to enter the cell down its electrochemical gradient, and therefore depend on sodium–
potassium ATPase to maintain that gradient. 
Transport of neurotransmitters plays an important role in nervous system function. In presyn-
aptic terminals transmitters are packaged in vesicles, ready for release. After release, they are 
removed from extracellular spaces by uptake mechanisms in the plasma membranes of neurons 
and glial cells. Transport into vesicles is by a hydrogen-transmitter exchange system. The hydro-
gen gradient is maintained, in turn, by hydrogen ATPase in the vesicle membrane. Uptake of the 
transmitters from extracellular spaces is by sodium cotransport systems. 
A number of transport ATPases and ion exchangers have been isolated and cloned, and their 
configurations in the membrane have been determined. All appear to have 10 to 12 transmem-
brane segments, and are assumed to form channel-like structures through which substances are 
moved by alternate exposure of binding sites to the extracellular and intracellular spaces. 

144 Chapter 9
At rest and during electrical activity, ions move into and out of cells along their electrochemi-
cal gradients. Clearly, if such ion movements continued without compensation the system 
eventually would run down and both the concentration gradients and the potential across 
the cell membrane would disappear. Recovery of ions that leak into or out of the cell at rest or 
during electrical activity is accomplished by a variety of transport mechanisms that move ions 
back across the membrane against their electrochemical gradients. Primary active transport
is driven directly by metabolic energy, specifically by the hydrolysis of ATP. Secondary active 
transport uses energy provided by the flux of an ion (usually sodium) down its established 
electrochemical gradient to transport other ions across the cell membrane, either in the same 
direction (cotransport) or in the opposite direction (ion exchange). 
The Sodium–Potassium Exchange Pump
Most excitable cells have resting membrane potentials in the range of –60 to –90 mV, while 
the equilibrium potential for sodium (ENa) is usually of the order of +50 mV (see Chapter 
6). Thus, there is a large electrochemical gradient tending to drive sodium into the cell, 
and it enters continuously through various pathways in the cell membrane. In addition, 
the equilibrium potential for potassium (EK) is more negative than the resting potential, so 
that potassium ions continually move out of the cell. In order to maintain the viability of 
the cell, it is necessary to transport sodium back out and potassium back in, against their 
electrochemical gradients. This perpetual task is carried out by the sodium–potassium 
exchange pump, which in its usual mode of operation transports three sodium ions out 
across the cell membrane for every two potassium ions carried inward. 
Early studies of sodium–potassium exchange were done by Hodgkin and Keynes and 
their colleagues on the giant axon of the squid,1,2 where it was shown clearly that the source 
of energy for the transport process was hydrolysis of ATP. During the same period, Skou3
demonstrated that an ATPase isolated from crab nerve had many of the biochemical properties 
that would be expected of a sodium–potassium exchange pump. Specifically, just as both 
sodium and potassium are required for the pump to work, the enzyme was stimulated by 
the simultaneous presence of sodium and potassium. Moreover, both sodium–potassium 
exchange and activity of the enzyme were inhibited by the poisonous glycoside ouabain. 
These observations led to the conclusion that the enzyme, sodium–potassium ATPase, is 
itself the transport molecule. It is one of a family of P-type ATPases (so-called because 
they form a phosphorylated intermediate) that derive energy for ion translocation from 
hydrolysis of ATP. Other members of the same family include calcium ATPases, which 
transport calcium out of the cytoplasm of cells, and vacuolar hydrogen ATPase, which 
transports protons into intracellular acidic vacuoles, including synaptic vesicles.
Biochemical Properties of Sodium–Potassium ATPase
The biochemical properties of sodium–potassium ATPase have been known for a num-
ber of years.4,5 The stoichiometry of cation binding to the enzyme is as expected from 
the transport characteristics: Three sodium and two potassium ions are bound for each 
molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. The requirement for sodium is remarkably specific. It is the 
only substrate accepted for net outward transport; conversely, it is the only monovalent 
cation not accepted for inward transport. Thus, lithium, ammonium, rubidium, cesium, 
and thallium are all able to substitute for potassium in the external solution but not for 
sodium in the internal solution. The requirement for external potassium is not absolute. In 
its absence the pump will extrude sodium at about 10 percent of capacity in an uncoupled 
mode. The transport system is blocked specifically by digitalis glycosides (drugs used for 
treating congestive heart failure), particularly ouabain and strophanthidin. Although they 
block sodium and potassium transport by ATPase, these drugs have no effect on the passive 
movements of sodium and potassium through membrane channels. 
Experimental Evidence that the Pump Is Electrogenic 
Because sodium–potassium ATPase transports unequal numbers of sodium and potas-
sium ions, each cycle of the pump results in the outward movement of one positive charge

across the membrane. For this reason the pump is said to be electrogenic. The electrogenic 
nature of the pump was tested experimentally in squid axons,1,2,6 and in a remarkable set 
of experiments by Thomas, using snail neurons.7,8 Snail neurons are sufficiently large to 
permit the insertion of several micropipettes through the cell membrane into the cytoplasm 
without damaging the cell. To examine how internal sodium concentration affected pump 
current and membrane potential, Thomas used two intracellular pipettes to deposit ions in 
the cell, one filled with sodium acetate and the other with lithium acetate (Figure 9.1A). A 
third intracellular pipette was used as an electrode to record membrane potential. A fourth 
pipette was used as a current electrode for voltage clamp experiments (see Chapter 7), and 
yet a fifth, made of sodium sensitive glass, monitored the intracellular sodium concentra-

FIGURE 9.1 Effects of Sodium Injection into a snail neuron on intracellular sodium concen-
tration, membrane potential, and membrane current. (A) Two micropipettes are used to inject 
either sodium or lithium; a sodium-sensitive electrode measures [Na]i; another electrode measures 
membrane potential and is also used in combination with a current-passing electrode to hold 
the membrane potential steady while measuring membrane current (shown in E). (B) Hyperpo-
larization of the membrane following intracellular injection of sodium. Note that the small rapid 
deflections are spontaneously occurring action potentials, reduced in size because of the poor 
frequency response of the pen recorder. Injection of lithium does not produce hyperpolarization. 
(C) After application of ouabain (20 μg/ml), which blocks the sodium pump, hyperpolarization by 
sodium injection is greatly reduced. (D) Removal of potassium from the extracellular solution blocks 
the pump, so that sodium injection produces no hyperpolarization until potassium is restored. 
(E) Measurements of membrane current, with the membrane potential clamped at –47 mV. Sodium 
injection results in an increase in intracellular sodium concentration, and an outward current 
across the cell membrane. Sharp deflections on the sodium concentration record are artifacts 
from the injection system; the dashed line indicates the time course of the change in 
concentration. (After Thomas, 1969.) 

146 Chapter 9
tion! To inject sodium, the sodium-filled pipette was made positive with respect to the 
lithium pipette. Thus, current flow in the injection system was between the two pipettes, 
with none of the injected current flowing through the cell membrane. 
The result of sodium injection is shown in Figure 9.1B. After a brief injection, the cell 
became hyperpolarized by about 15 mV, presumably because of increased pump activity. 
The potential recovered gradually over several minutes, as the excess sodium was extruded. 
Injection of lithium (by making the lithium pipette positive) produced no hyperpolarization. 
Several lines of evidence showed that the potential change after sodium injection was 
due to the action of a sodium pump. For example, the hyperpolarization could be greatly 
reduced or abolished by addition of the transport inhibitor, ouabain, to the bathing solution 
(Figure 9.1C). Similarly, sodium injection had little effect on potential when potassium 
was absent from the external solution; reintroduction of potassium after sodium injection, 
however, resulted in immediate hyperpolarization (Figure 9.1D). 
Quantitative estimates of the pump rate and the exchange ratio were obtained by voltage 
clamp experiments. This technique provided a means of measuring ionic current across the 
membrane, while the membrane potential was held constant (i.e., clamped). At the same 
time, intracellular sodium concentration was monitored. Sodium injection produced a 
transient rise in intracellular sodium, which was accompanied by a surge of outward current 
whose amplitude and duration followed the sodium concentration change (Figure 9.1E). 
The net charge carried out of the cell, which was calculated by measuring the area under 
the membrane current, amounted to only about one-third of the charge injected in the 
form of sodium ions. This result was consistent with the idea that for every three sodium 
ions pumped out of the cell, two potassium ions were carried inward.
Mechanism of Ion Translocation
The general sequence of events believed to underlie 
translocation of sodium and potassium by the enzyme 
is illustrated in Figure 9.2. Sodium and potassium 
binding sites, located within a channel-like structure, 
are exposed alternately to the intracellular and extra-
cellular solutions. The cyclic conformational changes 
are driven by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation 
of the protein, and are accompanied by changes in 
binding affinity for the two ions. Inward-facing sites 
have a low affinity for potassium and a high affinity 
for sodium (Figure 9.2A). Binding of three sodium 
ions causes a conformational change that leads to ATP 
binding, followed by phosphorylation of the enzyme 
(Figure 9.2B). Phosphorylation then produces a fur-
ther conformational change so that the ion-binding 
sites are exposed to the extracellular solution (Figure 
9.2C). The outward-facing sites have low sodium and 
high potassium affinities, so that the sodium ions 
are replaced by two potassium ions (Figure 9.2D).

enzyme and a return to the starting conformation (Figure 9.2E,F). The potassium ions are 
then released into the cytoplasm. 
Calcium Pumps
Changes in intracellular calcium are important for many neuronal functions. For example, 
increases in cytoplasmic calcium concentration mediate the release of neurotransmitters 
at synapses, activation of ion channels in the cell membrane, and regulation of a number 
of cytoplasmic enzymes. In muscle, increased intracellular calcium initiates contraction. 
Because these functional roles are associated with transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium 
concentration, it is important that the resting concentration be kept low. Otherwise, the vari-
ous mechanisms would be activated continuously rather than in response to specific stimuli. 
Transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium concentration are mediated either by entry 
of calcium through channels in the plasma membrane or by release from intracellular 
stores; return to resting concentration is achieved by activation of a number of transport 
proteins in the plasma membrane and in membranes of the intracellular storage compart-
ments, principally the endoplasmic reticulum (sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle) and 
mitochondria.9,10 In most neurons cytoplasmic concentrations of free calcium range from 
10 to 100 nM. The extracellular calcium concentration in vertebrate interstitial fluid is in the 
range of 2 to 5 mM, so that outward transport across the membrane is against a substantial 
electrochemical gradient. Transport systems within the cell maintain high concentrations 
of calcium within intracellular compartments. Calcium concentrations in the endoplasmic 
reticulum can reach 400 μM, and in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle can be as high 
as 10 mM. Transport of calcium out of the cytoplasm, across the plasma membrane, and 
into membrane-bound intracellular compartments is accomplished by calcium ATPase.11
An additional mechanism for transport of calcium across the plasma membrane that does 
not involve enzyme activity is discussed later in this chapter.

One family of calcium ATPases is concentrated in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum 
of neurons and in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle. These ATPases transport calcium 
from the cytoplasm into the membrane-bound intracellular compartments. In muscle, 
contraction is triggered by the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into 
the myoplasm. Rapid return of cytoplasmic calcium to its resting level, and hence prompt 
muscle relaxation, is accomplished by a high density of calcium ATPase in the sarcoplas-
mic reticulum membrane. The calcium transport cycle is analogous to that described for 
sodium–potassium ATPase and begins with the attachment of two calcium ions to high-
affinity (Km(Ca) ≈ 100 nM) sites facing the cytoplasm. The enzyme is then phosphorylated 
and undergoes a conformational change, resulting in the release of the calcium ions to the 
reticular compartment. Release of the bound calcium is followed by dephosphorylation 
and return to the starting molecular configuration. 
Plasma Membrane Calcium ATPase
Calcium ATPase is also found in the plasma membrane of all cells. The plasma membrane 
enzyme is similar in structure and function to its endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticular 
counterpart but differs in some details. The intracellular binding site has a high affinity for 
calcium, but only one calcium ion is bound during the transport cycle. In nerve and muscle 
the enzyme is only sparsely distributed in the plasma membrane, so its transport capacity is 
relatively low. Nonetheless, it is adequate to compensate for calcium influx into resting cells.
Sodium–Calcium Exchange
Many ion transport mechanisms make use of an entirely different principle for the uphill 
transfer of ions across the cell membrane: instead of relying on hydrolysis of ATP, ion move-
ment is coupled to the inward flux of sodium down its electrochemical gradient. Sodium, 
entering the cell down its electrochemical gradient through transport molecules provides

the energy required to carry other ions uphill against their electrochemical gradients, either 
into or out of the cell. A simple example is the 1:1 sodium–hydrogen exchange mechanism 
that contributes to the maintenance of intracellular pH. Protons are carried out of the 
cell against their electrochemical gradient in exchange for inward movement of sodium. 
Hydrogen, calcium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate are all transported in this way. 
These secondary transport systems account for a measurable fraction of the sodium entry 
into the resting cell. Ultimately, of course, the mechanisms depend on sodium–potassium 
ATPase to maintain the sodium gradient by pumping sodium ions back out of the cell. In 
some instances, potassium ions moving out of the cell down their electrochemical gradient 
also contribute energy to ion transport processes.
The NCX Transport System
At least two sodium–calcium exchange systems are found in plasma membranes. The most 
widely distributed of these is the sodium-calcium exchange (NCX) system.12,13 The trans-
port molecule carries one calcium ion outward for each three sodium ions entering the cell. 
The NCX exchanger has a lower affinity for calcium (K1/2Ca) ≈ 1.0 μM) than does calcium 
ATPase, but because the exchange molecules occur at a much higher density their transport 
capacity is about 50 times greater. The exchange system is called into play in excitable cells 
when calcium influx during electrical activity overwhelms the transport ability of the ATPase. 
The experiment shown in Figure 9.3 illustrates the operation of the sodium–calcium 
exchange mechanism in a squid axon. The intracellular concentration of ionized calcium 
was measured by luminescence of the calcium indicator, aequorin. In the steady state, 
the influx of calcium along its electrochemical gradient is balanced by outward transport 
through the ion exchanger (Figure 9.3A). At the beginning of the experiment (Figure 9.3B), 
the intracellular calcium concentration is relatively high, as the axon is bathed in high (112 
mM) levels of calcium. When the extracellular calcium concentration is reduced, the passive 
influx decreases. As a result, the intracellular calcium concentration falls, restoring 
the driving force for calcium entry until the passive influx again equals the rate of 
extrusion. Reducing the extracellular sodium concentration, on the other hand, 
increases intracellular calcium concentration. This is because the reduced driving 
force for sodium entry reduces the rate at which the exchanger extrudes calcium. 
Intracellular calcium concentration then rises until calcium influx is reduced by 
the same amount. Replacement of sodium by lithium (which does not enter the 
exchanger) results in a further increase in intracellular calcium. 
Reversal of Sodium–Calcium Exchange 
Ion exchange mechanisms can be made to run backwards by altering one or more of 
the ionic gradients involved in the exchange. An interesting feature of the NCX family 
of exchangers is that such reversal can occur readily under physiological conditions, 
FIGURE 9.3 Transport of Calcium Ions out of a squid axon. 
(A) Scheme for sodium–calcium exchange. Influx of three so-
dium ions down their electrochemical gradient is coupled to the 
extrusion of one calcium ion. Calcium concentration reaches 
a steady state when outward transport through the exchanger 
is equal to the inward calcium leak. (B) Effect of changes in 
extracellular calcium and sodium on intracellular calcium con-
centration. Changes in intracellular calcium concentration are 
measured by changes in luminescence of injected aequorin, 
indicated by current from the photodetector. Increased read-
ings mean increased intracellular free-calcium concentration. 
Reducing the extracellular calcium concentration from 112 mM 
to 11 mM reduces the intracellular concentration. Reducing 
extracellular sodium reduces outward calcium transport, and 
hence increases intracellular concentration. Lithium ions do 
not substitute for sodium in the transport system. (After Baker, 
Hodgkin, and Ridgeway, 1971.)

Ion Transport across Cell Membranes 149
in which case calcium enters through the system and sodium is extruded. The direction of 
transport is determined simply by whether the energy provided by the entry of three sodium 
ions is greater than or less than the energy required to extrude one calcium ion. One factor 
determining this energy balance is the membrane potential of the cell. Such dependence on 
potential arises because the exchange is not electrically neutral; rather each forward cycle of the 
transport molecule results in a net transfer of one positive charge inward across the membrane. 
As a result, forward transport is facilitated by membrane hyperpolarization and impeded, or 
even reversed, by depolarization.
The energy dissipated by sodium entry (or required for extrusion) is simply the product 
of charge moved across the membrane and the driving force for this movement; in other 
words, it is the charge multiplied by the difference between the sodium equilibrium po-
tential (ENa) and the membrane potential (Vm). For three sodium ions, this is 3(ENa – Vm). 
Similarly, for a single (divalent) calcium ion, the energy is 2(ECa– Vm). At some value of 
membrane potential the energies will be exactly equal and no exchange will occur. If we 
call this point the reversal potential, Vr, then: 
3(ENa – Vr) = 2(ECa – Vr)
and (by rearrangement) 
Vr = 3ENa – 2ECa
At potentials more negative than Vr, sodium moves into the cell and calcium is transported 
out. At more positive potentials, the sodium and calcium fluxes are reversed. 
Now suppose a nerve cell has internal sodium and calcium concentrations of 15 mM 
and 100 nM, respectively, and is bathed in a solution containing 150 mM sodium and 2 
mM calcium. These concentrations are reasonable physiological values for mammalian 
cells. Using the Nernst equation (see Chapter 4), the equilibrium potential for sodium is 
+58 mV and for calcium is +124 mV. Ion movement through the exchanger is zero at a 
membrane potential (Vr ) of –74 mV. This is in the range of resting membrane potentials 
for many cells so that, in any given cell, ion movements through the exchanger may be in 
one direction or the other, depending on the exact membrane potential, and on whether 
or not there has been previous sodium or calcium accumulation.
Sodium–Calcium Exchange in Retinal Rods
It is evident that the NCX type of exchanger would be a poor system for calcium extrusion 
from cells with low resting potentials; rather than being extruded, calcium would be accu-
mulated until a relatively high steady-state concentration was reached in the cytoplasm. An 
example of such a cell is the vertebrate retinal rod, which has a resting membrane potential 
of the order of –40 mV (see Chapter 20). These cells contain a second kind of sodium–
calcium exchange molecule in the plasma membranes of their outer segments.14 In addi-
tion to transporting sodium and calcium, the molecule transports potassium, and therefore 
is given the designation NCKX. The NCKX system is given an additional boost over the 
NCX exchanger by two differences in stoichiometry: (1) four (rather than three) sodium 
ions enter for each calcium ion extruded and (2) additional work is available from the ex-
trusion of one potassium ion that, like sodium, moves down its electrochemical gradient 
during the exchange. The reversal potential for sodium–potassium–calcium exchange is:
Vr = 4ENa – EK – 2ECa
Using the previous assumptions about ENa (58 mV) and ECa (124 mV) and assuming that 
EK = –90 mV, then Vr = +74 mV. Clearly, transport through the RetX exchanger is unlikely 
to reverse. 
Another way of viewing the exchange system is to ask what the intracellular concentra-
tion of calcium would be if Vr were equal to the resting potential of the cell. Using the same 
assumptions about sodium and potassium, we find that when Vr = –40 mV, ECa = 181 mV. 
With 2 mM extracellular calcium this is equivalent to an intracellular concentration of 1 
nM. In other words, at a membrane potential of –40 mV it is energetically possible for the 
exchanger to reduce the cytoplasmic calcium concentration to 1 nM. However, this low 
concentration could not be achieved in practice because it is about two orders of magnitude 
smaller than the affinity of the exchange molecule for calcium.

Chloride Transport
Intracellular chloride concentration is closely regulated in all cells. Such regulation is par-
ticularly important in neurons because direct synaptic inhibition (see Chapter 11) depends 
on the maintenance of low intracellular chloride. Although chloride-sensitive ATPases have 
been demonstrated in a number of tissues, including the brain,15 the bulk of chloride trans-
port across the plasma membrane of nerve cells is by secondary transport mechanisms. 
The most important are two cation-coupled transport systems: (1) a sodium–potassium–
chloride transport mechanism that moves chloride into the cell, and (2) an outward potas-
sium–chloride cotransport. In addition, all cells have one or more chloride–bicarbonate 
exchange systems that are concerned primarily with intracellular pH regulation. 
Inward Chloride Transport 
In many cells, such as skeletal muscle fibers, tubular cells of the kidney, and squid axons, 
chloride is actively accumulated. Chloride accumulation is dependent on the extracellular 
concentrations of both sodium and potassium, and the system transports all three ions 
inward across the cell membrane.16 The movement of sodium down its concentration 
gradient supplies the required energy. In squid axons the Na–K–Cl stoichiometry has been 
shown to be 2:1:3. In cells of the kidney the Na–K–Cl stoichiometry is 1:1:2, and the renal 
transport system operates in parallel with a second, potassium-independent mechanism 
that transports sodium and chloride in a 1:1 ratio (Figure 9.4A).
Outward Potassium–Chloride Cotransport
A second major transport mechanism for chloride involves cotransport of chloride and po-
tassium outward, across the cell membrane (Figure 9.4B). Potassium–chloride cotransport 
is best known for its role in cell volume regulation in a wide variety of tissues, but there 
is increasing evidence that it is important in regulation of intracellular chloride concen-
tration in neurons.17 As ion transport by the system is insensitive to extracellular sodium 
concentration, the energy required for outward chloride transport is supplied solely by the 
outward movement of potassium down its electrochemical gradient.
Both the inward and outward transport systems are blocked by the chloride transport 
inhibitors furosemide and bumetanide.
Chloride–Bicarbonate Exchange 
Chloride–bicarbonate exchange systems, operating in parallel with sodium–hydrogen exchange, 
serve primarily to regulate intracellular pH.18 Simple chloride–bicarbonate exchange is driven

FIGURE 9.4 Mechanisms of Chloride Transport. (A) In many cells, inward chloride transport is 
mediated by two independent mechanisms, both using the electrochemical gradient for sodium. One is 
sodium–chloride cotransport. The other is sodium–potassium–chloride cotransport, with a stoichiometry 
of 1:1:2. (B) Potassium–chloride cotransport uses the outward electrochemical gradient for potassium to 
transport chloride out of the cell. (C) Sodium dependent chloride–bicarbonate exchange uses the inward 
sodium gradient to move chloride out of the cell, at the same time exchanging bicarbonate with hydro-
gen ions. Note that all the chloride transport systems are electrically neutral.

by the outward gradient for bicarbonate produced by alkalinization of the cytoplasm and 
carries bicarbonate out of the cell and chloride inward on a 1:1 basis. Quantitatively, the role 
of this system is minimal in regulating intracellular chloride concentration in excitable cells.
Sodium-dependent chloride–bicarbonate exchange was first studied in squid axon and in 
snail neurons.19,20 Recovery from acidification of the cytoplasm, by injection of hydrochloric 
acid (HCl), or exposure to CO2, was prolonged when extracellular bicarbonate concentration 
was reduced or when intracellular chloride was depleted. In addition, recovery was virtually 
abolished when sodium was removed from the extracellular bathing solution. Thus, recovery 
involved inward movement of sodium down its electrochemical gradient, accompanied 
by bicarbonate, in exchange for chloride. Because the system is electrically neutral, it is as-
sumed to include the outward transport of protons as well, as indicated in Figure 9.4C. The 
exchange mechanism is inhibited by 4-acetamido-4ʹ-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2ʹ-disulfonic 
acid (SITS) and a related compound, 4,4ʹ-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2ʹ-disulfonate (DIDS).
Transport of Neurotransmitters
In addition to transporting inorganic ions, nerve cells have mechanisms for accumulating a 
variety of other substances, including those involved in synaptic transmission (see Chapter 
11). Neurotransmitters are transported into organelles within the cytoplasm of presynap-
tic nerve terminals (synaptic vesicles), where they are stored ready for release. After release, 
transmitters, such as norepinephrine, serotonin, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and 
glutamate, are recovered from the synaptic cleft by transporters in the plasma membranes of 
either the terminals themselves or of adjacent glial cells. All of these recovery processes involve 
secondary transport mechanisms that use energy from the movement of sodium, potassium, 
or hydrogen ions down their electrochemical gradients to power transmitter accumulation. 
Transport into Presynaptic Vesicles
Neurotransmitters are synthesized within the cytoplasm of nerve terminals and then concen-
trated into presynaptic vesicles by secondary transport mechanisms coupled to proton efflux. 
This transport mechanism is analogous to sodium-driven secondary transport across the plasma 
membrane, but instead of a sodium gradient the system uses a proton gradient established 
by the transport of hydrogen ions from the cytoplasm into the vesicle by hydrogen ATPase.21
Three genetic families of proton-coupled transporters are expressed in the lipid 
bilayers of secretory vesicles (Table 9.1) designated as SLC17 and SLC18 and SLC32 (SLC

means solute carrier). SLC18 has three isotypes.22 Two of these are the monoamine trans-
porters VMAT1 (SLC18A1) and VMAT2 (SLC18A2), which are responsible for vesicular 
accumulation of norepinephrine, dopamine, histamine, and serotonin (5-HT). The third, 
VAChT (SLC18A3), is responsible for accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh). GABA and 
glycine are concentrated by the product of a single gene (SLC32), referred to as the vesicular 
inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) or vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT).23
Glutamate has its own transport family, SLC17, for which three isoforms have been identi-
fied: VGLUT1, 2, and 3 (SLC17A7, A6, and A8).24 Glutamate transport is unusual in that it 
includes cotransport of chloride into the vesicle.25 VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 are distributed 
separately to synapses in the brain.26 VGLUT3 is found in various neuronal and non-neuronal 
structures, including non-glutamatergic synapses. It is responsible for vesicular glutamate 
uptake in cochlear hair cells. VGLUT3 knockout mice are profoundly deaf because their 
hair cells no longer release glutamate.27 
There is a substantial electrochemical gradient for proton efflux across the vesicle 
membrane. For example, in filled monoaminergic and cholinergic vesicles, the pH gradient 
across the vesicle membrane is about –1.4 units and the electrical gradient is about +40 mV. 
The stoichiometry for the uptake systems is shown in Figure 9.5. Because the exchanges 
are not electrically neutral, all are dependent on the potential across the vesicle membrane 
as well as on the pH gradient.
Transmitter Uptake
After they are released from presynaptic nerve terminals into the synaptic cleft, most neu-
rotransmitters are recovered either by the nerve terminals themselves or by adjacent glial 
cells (see Chapter 10). In general, such recovery serves two purposes: (1) The transmitter 
is removed from the extracellular space in the region of the synapse, which helps to termi-
nate its synaptic action and prevents diffusion to other synaptic regions; (2) transmitter 
molecules recovered by the nerve terminal can be packaged again for rerelease. All uptake 
mechanisms use the electrochemical gradient for sodium to carry transmitter substances 
across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm.
Two major transmitter uptake families are expressed in the cell membranes of neurons 
and glial cells.28,29 Members of the SLC1 family mediate the uptake of glutamate and neutral 
amino acids, while SLC6 family members are responsible for uptake of dopamine, 5-HT, 
norepinephrine, glycine, and GABA. Each family has a number of isotypes (see Table 9.1). 
In the SLC1 system, inward transport of one glutamate ion is coupled to the influx of two 
sodium ions and the efflux of one potassium ion, coupled with either the extrusion of an 
hydroxyl ion or influx of a proton (Figure 9.6A).30 In the SLC6 system, uptake of each 
transmitter molecule is accompanied by the entry of two sodium and one chloride ion 
(Figure 9.6B).31
One interesting aspect of the indirectly coupled transport mechanisms for transmitter 
uptake is that they are not, as a rule, electrically neutral. Thus, the direction of transport 
can be reversed by membrane depolarization, sometimes within the physiological range of 
membrane potentials.32 Outward transport of GABA by this mechanism has been demon-

stoichiometry is 2:1 for monoamine and acetylcho-
line transport (A), 1:1 for glycine and GABA (B) and

strated in catfish retinal cells.33 The transport system, then, not only mediates reuptake of 
the transmitter, but might also function as a mechanism for transmitter release. Reversal 
of transmitter uptake can have deleterious effects. After brain damage by stroke or trauma, 
outward transport of glutamate can lead to the accumulation of cytotoxic amounts of 
glutamate around neurons in the damaged area and thereby to further cell death.34
The SLC1 family includes five high-affinity glutamate transporters: excitatory amino 
acid transporter or EAAT1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (see Table 9.1). EAAT1, known as glial high affinity 
glutamate transporter (GLAST) in humans, is found in glia and is particularly abundant in 
the cerebellum. It also occurs in supporting cells in the retina, and it is responsible for uptake 
of glutamate released by hair cells in the cochlea.35 EAAT2 is found in astrocytes, particularly 
in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. EAAT3 is expressed in neurons throughout the 
brain, including those in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, superior colliculus, and thalamus. 
EAAT4 is found primarily in cerebellar Purkinje cells on postsynaptic dendritic spines and 
has a substantial chloride conductance associated with substrate transport. EAAT5 occurs 
mainly in rod photoreceptors and bipolar cells in the retina and exhibits a prominent 
chloride conductance.
The SLC6 family includes transporters for GABA (GAT), norepinephrine (NET), 
dopamine (DAT), serotonin (SERT), and glycine (GLYT). The GABA transporter has three 
isoforms, GAT1, 2, and 3. GAT1 is the predominant neuronal transporter in the brain. It is 
found primarily along axons and around presynaptic nerve terminals. In the brain, GAT2 
is found principally in meninges, ependyma, and choroid plexus and does not appear to 
be involved in neural signaling. GAT3 is expressed in glial cells. NET is found in neuroad-
renergic neurons throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems and in adrenal 
chromaffin cells. DAT is found in dopaminergic neurons in the brain, localized around 
synaptic junctions. SERT is widely distributed in brain and is expressed in extrasynaptic 
axonal membranes. GLYT has two isoforms. GLYT2 is the neuronal transporter, found in 
association with glycinergic nerve terminals. It differs from other members of the SLC6 
family in that the transport stoichiometry is 3 sodium to 1 chloride to 1 glycine, suggest-
ing that it is able to maintain extracellular glycine concentration at extremely low levels. 
GLYT1 is the predominant glial glycine transporter and has five splice variants: GLYT1a–e. 
GLYT1b and c are nervous system specific, while GLYT1e and f are found only in the retina. 
ACh is recycled in a different way. It is synthesized in the cell cytoplasm from acetyl 
coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and choline (see Chapter 15). After release from the presynaptic 
terminal, its postsynaptic action is terminated by an enzyme (acetylcholinesterase) that 
hydrolyzes it to acetate and choline. Approximately half of the choline is recovered by a 
high-affinity (Km 2μM) uptake mechanism and reused for ACh synthesis.36 Like the mono-
amine and GABA/glycine transport systems, choline uptake is dependent on extracellular 
sodium and chloride concentrations. 
Molecular Structure of Transporters
So far, we have dealt with functional properties of transporters with no reference to their 
molecular structure. As with membrane channels (see Chapter 5), each functional group 
is represented by a specific transport protein or, more commonly, a family of proteins.

cine/monoamine systems.

Many of these proteins have been isolated and cloned, and deductions have been made 
about their configurations in the membrane. Their structures are summarized below, 
and examples are shown in Figure 9.7. The proteins have nine to twelve transmembrane 
segments and are assumed to form channel-like structures through which substances are 
moved by alternate exposure of binding sites to the extracellular and intracellular spaces. 
ATPases
The molecular structure of sodium–potassium ATPase is known in some detail.37,38 It 
is assembled from two subunits, α and β. The α-subunit, with an apparent molecu-
lar weight of about 100 kD, is responsible for the enzymatic activity of the pump and 
contains all the substrate binding sites. The smaller (35 kD) β-subunit has a number of 
extracellular glycosylation sites and is necessary for pump function, but its precise role 
is not clear. Their proposed subunit structures are shown in Figure 9.7A. The α-subunit 
has ten transmembrane segments, four of which (M4, M5, M6 and M8) are believed 
to form the transmembrane pore containing the cation-binding sites. The nucleotide 
binding and phosphorylation sites have been localized to the large cytoplasmic region 
between M4 and M5. The β-subunit contains only one putative membrane-spanning 
region, with the bulk of the peptide in the extracellular space. There are four α-subunit 
isoforms (α1–α4), all expressed in the nervous system. Two (β1 and β2) of three known 
β-subunit isoforms are found in nervous tissue. 
Calcium ATPases consist of a single polypeptide chain of about 100 kD, analogous in 
structure to the α-subunit of sodium–potassium ATPase but with an extended cytoplasmic 
segment at the carboxyl end.11 Unlike sodium–potassium ATPase, it does not require a 
β-subunit for enzyme activity. The sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium 
ATPase (SERCA) family consists of three basic gene products—SERCA1, SERCA2, and 
SERCA3—each containing two alternatively spliced transcripts. The molecular structure

of SERCA1a has been determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 0.26 nm.39 The 
family of plasma membrane calcium pumps is similar in structure to the SERCA enzymes, 
and is comprised of four basic gene products (PMCA1–4). Approximately 30 additional 
isoforms are generated by alternative splicing. 
Sodium–Calcium Exchangers
Sodium–calcium exchange molecules are widely spread throughout the animal kingdom. 
The NCX family of exchangers includes three mammalian homologues, NCX1–3. NCX1 
is found in heart muscle, while NCX2 and 3 are found in brain.40 The cardiac exchanger 
contains 938 amino acids with nine transmembrane segments (Figure 9.7B). Homologous 
regions known as α-repeats are found within the molecule in segments 2, 3, and 7. The 
molecule has an extracellular reentry loop between segments 2 and 3, and a cytoplasmic 
reentry loop between segments 7 and 8. A large intracellular loop between segments 5 and 
6 is the site of extensive alternative splicing. The loop contains important regulatory bind-
ing sites, but is not essential for the transport process. 
The NCKX1 exchanger is somewhat larger, with 1199 amino acids. Other members 
of the family, NCKX2–4, are smaller in size, containing 600–660 residues. All have 11 
transmembrane segments and, like the NCX exchangers, have a large intracellular loop in 
the middle of the molecule.14
Chloride Transporters 
The K–Cl cotransporters, KCC1–KCC4, and the Na–K–2Cl transporters, NKCC1 and 
NKCC2, are both members of the same genetic family of electroneutral cation-coupled 
transport molecules and are similar in structure.41 The KCC proteins consist of about 1100 
amino acids with intracellular amino and carboxyl terminals separated by 12 transmem-
brane segments (Figure 9.7C). The NKCC molecule is slightly larger (about 1200 amino 
acids) with a similar topological arrangement. NKCC2 is absent from nervous tissue, being 
specific to kidney. KCC2 is unique in being specific to brain. 
A sodium-dependent, chloride–bicarbonate exchanger (NDCBE) has been cloned 
from human brain and also from squid axon.42,43 The squid axon protein consists of 
about 1200 amino acids, with intracellular amino and carboxyl terminals separated by 14 
transmembrane segments. The human exchanger is slightly smaller. 
Transport Molecules for Neurotransmitters
The monoamine and ACh transporters (VMAT 1 and 2, and VAChT) were the first ve-
sicular transporters to be cloned.44 The molecules are 520 to 530 amino acids in length 
and hydropathy analysis suggests that they contain 12 transmembrane segments (Figure 
9.7D).22 VAChT is about 40% identical to VMAT1 and VMAT2, which are about 65% 
identical to one another. The vesicular transport molecule for GABA and glycine has also 
been cloned.45,46 Its structure is distinct from that of the monoamine and ACh transport-
ers, with only ten putative transmembrane segments. The three members of the vesicular 
glutamate transport family are roughly 65 kD in mass and contain 560 to 590 amino acids, 
with ten potential transmembrane helices.47 
The family of proteins associated with uptake of norepinephrine (NET), serotonin (SERT), 
dopamine (DAT), GABA (GAT), and glycine (GLYT) into axon terminals proteins have an 
apparent mass in the range of 80 to 100 kD.48 The primary sequence of the choline transporter 
suggests that it may belong to the same superfamily.49 The crystal structure of a bacterial 
homologue (LeuTAa) of the monoamine transporters has been analyzed at a resolution of 
1.65 Å.50 The molecule is a dimer with each subunit containing twelve transmembrane segments. 
Five members of the family of proteins responsible for the uptake of glutamate have 
been isolated.51 They are relatively small, containing 500 to 600 amino acids and having 
apparent masses of about 65 kD. The structure of a homologous bacterial transporter 
(GltPh) has been resolved at a 3.5 Å resolution.52 Each of its three subunits has eight trans-
membrane segments with two hairpin loops imbedded in opposite faces of the plasma 
membrane (Figure 9.7E).

Significance of Transport Mechanisms
Primary and secondary active ion transport molecules provide essential background mecha-
nisms for maintaining cell homeostasis. However, their roles in nervous system function 
often extend well beyond such relatively mundane housekeeping duties, leading to an active 
role of transport in cell signaling. For example, activation of sodium–potassium ATPase by 
sodium accumulation during action potential activity in small nerve branches can produce 
a transient hyperpolarization and block conduction. 
Another example is related to the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA on GABAA recep-
tors, which when activated form chloride channels (see Chapter 11). In mature brain cells 
GABA causes inward chloride flux and hence hyperpolarization. However, in embryonic rat 
brain cells GABA produces depolarization. During postnatal development, the depolarizing 
response gradually disappears and eventually is replaced by hyperpolarization. This change 
in synaptic behavior occurs because intracellular chloride concentration is relatively high 
in embryonic neurons, and it decreases to the mature level during the postnatal period. 
The change in intracellular chloride concentration is the direct result of altered chloride 
transport across the cell membrane. In embryonic cells, chloride transport is dominated 
by the inwardly directed NKCC1 transporter, so that intracellular chloride concentration is 
relatively high. During postnatal development, expression of NKCC1 virtually disappears.53
At the same time, expression of the outward chloride transporter KCC2, which is absent 
in embryonic cells, shows a marked increase.54,55 
Finally, it is worth noting that monoamine transporters such as SERT are prime targets 
for drugs (e.g., fluoxetine, Prozac) used in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as 
depression and anxiety.56
In summary, it is useful to think of ion channels as mediating electrical signaling, and 
transport molecules as maintaining the background conditions under which such signaling 
occurs. We should remember, however, that the two types of molecules often interact in 
ways more complicated than this to regulate nervous system function. 
SUMMARY
 
■
A number of membrane proteins transport substances 
into and out of cells. One example is sodium–potassium 
ATPase, which transports three sodium ions outward 
across the cell membrane, and two potassium ions 
inward, per molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. The transport 
system maintains intracellular sodium and potassium 
concentrations at constant levels in spite of steady 
leakage into and out of the cells. 
 
■
Calcium concentrations in the cell cytoplasm are kept 
low by two classes of calcium ATPases. One, plasma 
membrane calcium ATPase, transports calcium out 
of the cell. The other, endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic 
reticulum ATPase, concentrates calcium into 
intracellular compartments. 
 
■
Another mechanism for calcium transport is sodium–
calcium exchange: Sodium, entering the cell down its 
electrochemical gradient, provides energy for outward 
transport of calcium. This mechanism is an example 
of indirect transport, which relies on maintenance of 
the sodium gradient by sodium–potassium ATPase. 
In most neurons the transport molecule exchanges 
three sodium ions for one calcium ion. Under some 
physiological conditions, the exchanger can run in 
reverse. In retinal rods the transport molecule carries 
one calcium ion and one potassium ion out of the cell in 
exchange for the entry of four sodium ions. 
 
■
There are two main mechanisms for extrusion of 
chloride from cells. One is chloride–bicarbonate 
exchange, which is important for intracellular 
pH regulation and depends on the sodium 
electrochemical gradient for its operation. The second 
is potassium–chloride cotransport, which relies on 
the electrochemical gradient for outward potassium 
movement across the cell membrane. In some cells 
chloride is accumulated, rather than extruded. Chloride 
accumulation relies on the sodium electrochemical 
gradient and is accompanied by inward movement of 
potassium.
 
■
In presynaptic vesicles a hydrogen-transmitter 
exchange system transports neurotransmitters from the 
cytoplasm into the vesicle lumen. Neurotransmitters 
released from presynaptic terminals are removed from 
extracellular spaces by uptake systems in neuron 
and glial cell membranes utilizing sodium-transmitter 
cotransport. 
 
■
The amino acid sequences of most transport molecules 
are known, and predictions have been made about 
their configuration in the membrane. Most have nine to 
twelve transmembrane segments and are assumed to 
form pore-like structures through which ions move by 
alternate exposure of binding sites to the extracellular 
and intracellular spaces.

Properties and Functions 
of Neuroglial Cells
N
erve cells in the central and peripheral nervous system are surrounded by satellite cells. 
These consist of Schwann cells in the periphery and neuroglial cells in the central nervous 
system. In this chapter, we discuss the structure and properties of the satellite cells, their 
interactions with neurons, and open questions regarding their functions.
Neuroglial cells make up about one-half of the volume of the brain and greatly outnumber neu-
rons. The main classes of neuroglial cells are oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and radial glial cells. 
Microglial cells constitute a separate population of wandering phagocytotic cells in the CNS. Neu-
rons and glial cells are densely packed. Their membranes are separated from each other by nar-
row fluid-filled extracellular spaces that are about 20 nanometers (nm) wide. Glial cell membranes, 
like those of neurons, contain channels for ions, receptors for transmitters, ion transport pumps, 
and amino acid transporters. In addition, glial cells are linked to each other by low-resistance gap 
junctions that permit direct passage of ions and small molecules. As in kidney and epithelial cells, 
waves of increased intracellular calcium concentration spread rhythmically through networks of 
glial cells connected by electrical synapses. Glial cells have more negative resting potentials than 
neurons. They do not generate action potentials. 
Among the essential functions of satellite cells are the following: Oligodendrocytes and 
Schwann cells form myelin around axons, which speeds up conduction of the nerve impulse. Glial 
cells and Schwann cells secrete neurotrophic molecules and guide growing axons to their targets 
during development. Astrocytes within the central nervous system cause capillaries to become im-
permeable to certain molecules, and thereby create the blood–brain barrier. Microglial cells invade 
regions of damage or inflammation and phagocytose debris. 
By virtue of the close apposition of glial and neuronal membranes, dynamic interactions oc-
cur between the two types of cells. Neurons release K+ and transmitters into narrow extracellular 
spaces and thereby depolarize glial membranes. This action in turn gives rise to waves of in-
creased cytoplasmic calcium concentration that spread through electrically coupled glial net-
works. Activated glial cells liberate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), glutamate, and potassium into 
extracellular space. They also increase the circulation of blood locally in an area of brain with high 
neural activity. A well-established role of glia in the central nervous system is spatial buffering 
through uptake of transmitters and K+. An area of current research concerns the way in which glial 
cells could influence signaling at neuron-to-neuron synapses.

160 Chapter 10
Nerve cells in the brain are intimately surrounded by satellite cells called neuroglial cells, 
glial cells, or glia. It has been estimated that they outnumber neurons by at least 10 to 1 
and make up about one-half of the bulk of the nervous system. From the time of their 
discovery, the problem of what the glial cells do has posed a challenging question for 
neurobiologists. In spite of the prevalence of glial cells, the physiological activities of the 
nervous system are often discussed in terms of neurons only, as if glia did not exist. This 
chapter emphasizes experiments dealing with the physiological properties of glial cells and 
their functional interactions with neurons. There exist now textbooks1 and journals (Glia, 
Neuron Glia Biology) devoted to glial cells.
Historical Perspective
Glial cells were first described in 1846 by Rudolf Virchow, who thought of them as “nerve 
glue” and gave them their name. Excerpts from a paper by Virchow give the flavor of his 
thinking:
Hitherto, considering the nervous system, I have only spoken of the really nervous 
part of it. But. . . it is important to have a knowledge of that substance…which 
lies between the proper nervous parts, holds them together and gives the whole its 
form…[this] has induced me to give it a new name, that of neuroglia…Experience 
shows us that this very interstitial tissue of the brain and spinal marrow is one of the 
most frequent sites of morbid change…Within the neuroglia run the vessels, which 
are therefore nearly everywhere separated from the nervous substance by a slender 
intervening layer, and are not in immediate contact with it.2
In subsequent years, neuroglial cells were studied intensively by neuroanatomists and 
pathologists, who knew them to be the most common source of tumors in the brain. This 
is not so surprising, because certain glial cells—unlike the vast majority of neurons—can 
still divide in the mature animal. Among early speculations about glial cell function in 
relation to neurons were structural support, the provision of nutrients to neurons, secre-
tion of trophic molecules, and the prevention of “cross talk” by current spread during 
conduction of nerve impulses.3–5
Appearance and Classification of Glial Cells
A distinct structural feature of neuroglial cells compared with neurons is the absence of 
axons. A representative picture of mammalian neuroglial cells is shown in Figure 10.1. 
In the vertebrate central nervous system, glial cells are usually subdivided into several 
distinctive classes.1,6
Astrocytes make contact with capillaries and neurons. There are two principal sub-
groups: (1) fibrous astrocytes, which contain filaments and are prevalent among bundles of 
myelinated nerve fibers in the white matter of the brain; and (2) protoplasmic astrocytes, 
which contain less fibrous material and are abundant in the gray matter around nerve cell 
bodies, dendrites, and synapses.
Oligodendrocytes are predominant in the white matter, where they form myelin around 
larger axons (see Chapter 8).
Radial glial cells play an essential role in the developing central nervous system. They 
stretch through the thickness of the spinal cord, retina, cerebellum, or cerebral cortex to 
the surface, forming elongated filaments along which developing neurons migrate to their 
final destinations. In addition, cells resembling radial glia have been shown to generate 
neurons in the developing cerebral cortex. In adult CNS, radial glia are represented by 
Bergmann cells in the cerebellum and Müller cells in the retina. 
Ependymal cells that line the inner surfaces of the brain, in the ventricles, are usually 
classified as glial cells.
Microglial cells are distinct from neuroglial cells in structure, properties, and lineage.7,8
They resemble macrophages in the blood and probably arise from them.
In vertebrate peripheral nerves and ganglia, Schwann cells are analogous to glial cells. 
They form myelin around the fast-conducting axons. Schwann cells also enclose smaller 
axons (less than 1 micrometer [μm] in diameter) without forming a myelin sheath.

The term satellite cell is used in this chapter to refer collectively to non-neuronal cells 
in general; it includes glial cells in the CNS and Schwann cells in the periphery.
The various types of satellite cells can be distinguished by injecting them with labels, 
such as dyes in living preparations or by immunological techniques (Figure 10.2). Antibod-
ies have been prepared that bind specifically to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, or 
Schwann cells.9 For example, fibrous astrocytes can be stained with an antibody against a 
protein known as glial fibrillary acidic protein or GFAP (see Figure 10.2B).10
Like the neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system, glial cells and Schwann 
cells have different embryological origins. Glial cells in the central nervous system are 
derived from precursor cells that line the neural tube, whereas Schwann cells arise from 
the neural crest (see Chapter 25). In animals such as the leech11 and zebrafish12 glial cell 
development can be observed directly in the living embryo. Precursor cells can be labeled 
by injection of a marker or by infection at an early stage with a virus encoding a labeled 
gene that is handed on to the descendants.13 The labeled cells can then be identified as 
astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. In this way one can follow cell lineages and pinpoint the

stages at which glial cells diverge from neurons during development. Microglial cells arise 
from mesoderm and are able to move to sites of injury.
Structural Relations between Neurons, Glia, and Capillaries 
A glance at electron micrographs of brain tissue brings home the close packing of neurons and 
glia. Figure 10.3 shows an example from the cerebellum of a rat. The section is filled with neu-
rons and glial cells, which can be distinguished by a number of criteria. Glial processes tend to 
be thin, at times less than 1 μm thick. Larger volumes of glial cytoplasm appear only around the 
glial nuclei. The extracellular space is restricted to narrow clefts, about 20 nm wide that separate 
all cell boundaries. No special connections, such as synaptic structures or gap junctions, are 
seen between neurons and glia in adult CNS, and physiological tests fail to reveal direct low-
resistance pathways between them.14 During development, occasional structures resembling 
synapses have been observed between glial precursors and neurons.15 Electrical synapses do, 
however, link glial cells to one another through gap junctions (see Chapter 7).14,16 The relation 
between glial cells, neurons, capillaries, and extracellular space is diagrammed in Figure 10.4.

Physiological Properties of Neuroglial Cell Membranes
For technical reasons, Kuffler and Potter14 used the CNS of the leech to record from glial 
cells—at a time when nothing was known about their membrane properties. The glial 
cells in a leech ganglion are large and transparent (see Figure 18.12). They appear under 
the dissecting microscope as spaces between nerve cells and can be recorded from with 
sharp microelectrodes or by patch electrodes.17 After one has established its physiologi-
cal properties, the glial cell can be injected with a fluorescent marker, such as Lucifer 
yellow, and its form observed in the living preparation. Once leech glial cells had been 
described, it became practicable to record from and label amphibian and mammalian 
glial cells,18 which were found to share many key properties with the leech glia. Far from 
being a roundabout approach, use of the leech turned out to be a shortcut to the study 
of glia in the vertebrate CNS.19
As in the leech, mammalian glial cells have resting potentials greater (more negative 
inside) than those of neurons. The largest membrane potentials recorded from neurons are 
about –75 mV, whereas the values for glial cells approach –90 mV. Another distinguishing 
feature of mature glial cells in situ is the absence of conducted action potentials. 
The glial membrane behaves like a potassium electrode; that is, its behavior follows the 
Nernst equation in solutions containing different potassium concentrations (see Chapter 6). 
Though other channels are present, sodium and chloride make only a small contribution 
to the resting membrane potential.20 
The distribution of potassium channels has been explored over the surface of Müller 
glial cells and astrocytes isolated from the retina and optic nerves of many species.21 The 
potassium sensitivity is distributed in a characteristic pattern, being highest over the end 
feet and lower over the soma of the Müller cell. Figure 10.5 shows an isolated salamander 
Müller cell and its responses to a high concentration of potassium applied to different 
regions of the surface from a pipette. At early stages of development, potassium channels 
are distributed more uniformly over Müller cells. Thus, the high concentration at the end 
feet occurs as tadpoles become transformed into adult frogs.22 The possible significance is 
discussed later in this chapter.

Ion Channels, Pumps, and Receptors in Glial Cell Membranes
Glial cells and Schwann cells display a variety of ion channels and pumps in their membranes: 
1. As already shown, potassium conductances predominate.19
2. Voltage-activated sodium and calcium channels are present in the membranes of Schwann 
cells and astrocytes.23 In Müller cells, the overall ratio of potassium permeability to 
sodium permeability cells has been estimated to be approximately 100:1. As previously 
mentioned, in spite of occasional claims to the contrary,24 the activation of sodium and 
calcium channels does not give rise to action potentials in mature glial cells. During 
development, action potentials have been seen in glial precursors. (see De Biase et al.15) 
3. Patch clamp recordings reveal the presence of chloride channels in Schwann cells and 
astrocytes.25
4. Ion pumps for transport of sodium and potassium as well as of bicarbonate and protons 
occur in glial cells.26
5. Transporters for glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine are abundant in 
glial membranes: They take up transmitter liberated by neurons.27
6. Oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and Schwann cells display receptors for transmitters.28,29
Electrical Coupling between Glial Cells
Adjacent glial cells are linked to each other by gap junctions (see Chapter 11). In this respect 
they resemble epithelial and gland cells as well as smooth muscle and heart muscle fibers. 
Ions and small molecules are exchanged directly between cells without passing through 
the extracellular space, and such interconnections may be used for reducing concentration 
gradients.16,19,30,31 Optical measurements of intracellular calcium show that waves and brief 
spikes of increased concentration occur in activated glial cells and spread from one coupled 
cell to the next (see below). As in the leech, no gap junctions between neurons and glial 
cells have been detected in vertebrate glial cells. Current flow across nerve membranes has 
no direct effect on the neighboring glial membrane.
Functions of Neuroglial Cells
Over the years, almost every nervous system task for which no other obvious explanation has 
been found has been attributed to glial cells. In the following sections, we first discuss well-
established functions of glial cells and then intriguing questions about their functional role,

which require further elucidation. Modern papers on glia often contain sentences to the effect 
that “For many years, glial cells were considered to have merely a supporting function…”—a 
puzzling statement since their roles in development and myelin formation were established 
long ago. Their role in signaling and synapse formation is now being studied intensively.32–35
It seems likely that many as yet undiscovered functions of CNS glia are concerned with 
maintaining the microenvironment for the brain. This densely packed, delicate structure is 
situated within an inflexible skull. The brain can neither swell nor shrink without disastrous 
consequences for function. Yet regions that are active receive an increased blood flow, and any 
swelling that follows damage must be compensated for by decreased volume elsewhere within 
the bony surround of the CNS. Noteworthy in the brain is the absence of any lymphatic system. 
Myelin and the Role of Neuroglial Cells in Axonal Conduction
One important function of oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells is to produce the myelin 
sheath around axons—a high-resistance covering akin to the insulating material around 
wires (see Chapter 8). The myelin is interrupted at the nodes of Ranvier (Figure 10.6), which

occur at regular intervals.36 Since the ionic current associated with the conducted nerve 
impulse cannot flow across the myelin, ions move in and out at the nodes. As a result, the 
conduction velocity is increased. At nodes within the CNS, a characteristic feature is the 
presence of astrocytic processes that contact the axon.37
The association of Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes with axons to form myelin raises a 
number of interesting problems. For example, what are the genetic or environmental factors 
that enable glial cells to select the appropriate axons, to surround them at the right time, and 
to maintain myelin sheaths around them? What neurological disorders result from disease or 
genetic abnormalities of myelin? For the formation of the myelin sheath during development, 
complex and precise interactions occur between axons and satellite cells. The spacing of the 
nodes, the seals between the two types of cells at the paranodal areas, and the distribution 
of sodium and potassium channels must be matched and positioned for rapid conduction.
The dynamic interactions between neurons and Schwann cells have been analyzed by 
experiments made in living fish embryos and in tissue culture.38–40 Schwann cell develop-
ment, myelination and remyelination of axons, parallel the events that occur in vivo. At 
the molecular level, key proteins that play a part in Schwann cell–axon interactions have 
been identified. For example, Shooter and his colleagues have shown that when Schwann 
cells are cultured in a dish on their own, a peripheral myelin protein (known as PMP22) is 
synthesized.41 Under these conditions, the turnover of PMP22 is rapid, and it is degraded 
in the endoplasmic reticulum. When neurons are introduced to the culture, as illustrated 
in Figure 10.7, the fate of the protein changes. After contact between Schwann cells and 
axons, PMP22 is translocated to the Schwann cell membrane. This is an essential step for 
myelin to be formed. The signals that pass between neurons and Schwann cells are not 
yet known, but it has been shown that a potent neurotrophin, a nerve growth factor (see 
Chapter 24), can regulate myelin formation.42,43
The exact amount of PMP22 that is produced is critical for proper myelination; with 
over- or underexpression of PMP22, disorders occur. Figure 10.8 shows that a change in 
a single amino acid of PMP22 (e.g., from leucine to proline) results in “trembler” mice, 
which exhibit deficient myelination and serious neurological defects. Hereditary human 
neuropathies arise in families with the same mutation.

A number of experiments have provided evidence that glial cells can influence the 
clustering of sodium channels in myelinated nerve fibers. Changes occur in the distribution 
of ion channels in nodes, paranodal areas, and internodes as axons become myelinated, 
demyelinated, and remyelinated.44,45 The process resembles the clustering of transmitter 
receptors at postsynaptic sites brought about by innervation. Astrocytic fingers in the nodal 
region themselves show intense labeling with saxitoxin (a toxin that binds to sodium chan-
nels; see Chapter 4), indicating a high density of sodium channels in the glial membrane.46
It has been proposed that transfer of sodium channels might occur from astrocytes to nodes 
of Ranvier,47 but there is no direct evidence for this interesting speculation.
Glial Cells and Development 
Essential aspects of development that involve satellite cells are described in Chapter 25. 
Here we emphasize certain key features of the functional role played by glia, Schwann cells, 
and microglia. For example, glial and Schwann cells secrete molecules, such as laminin and 
nerve growth factor,48,49 that promote the outgrowth of neurites, both in culture and in the 
animal. Glial cells can also act as repellents that inhibit neurite outgrowth.50 An inhibitory 
protein, known as NOGO-A, is present in myelin and oligodendrocytes. This molecule stops 
neuronal growth cones from advancing and causes their collapse.51 Growth-inhibiting pro-
teins could help to delineate tracts and boundaries in the spinal cord: growing fibers would 
be stopped from inappropriately entering or wandering out of specified pathways. The 
possible effects of these proteins on regeneration after injury are discussed in Chapter 27.
During CNS development, glial cells have been shown to play a role during the ag-
gregation of neurons into well-defined nuclei. Prospective nuclei and structures that 
develop in situ and in culture are first outlined by glial cells.52 Thus, as neurons arrive in 
the somatosensory cortex of the developing mouse, the well-defined barrels (see Chapter 
21) are being outlined by glia that take up their places at early stages.53
A mechanism by which radial glial cells guide neuronal migration during development 
has been demonstrated in experiments by Rakic,54,55 Hatten,56,57 and their colleagues (see 
also Chapter 25). During development of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum 
in both monkeys and humans, nerve cells migrate to their destinations along radial glial 
processes. A time-lapse sequence of the movement of a hippocampal neuron along a radial 
glial cell is shown in Figure 10.9. Migrating neurons recognize surface molecules on the 
glial processes specific for their neuronal type. For example, hippocampal radial glial cells 
provide guidance cues for hippocampal but not for cortical neurons. The mature neurons 
send out axons and form connections with their targets. 
An unexpected new finding is that during development neurons can be produced by 
division of cells that resemble radial glial cells. Thus, in addition to providing scaffolds for

neuronal migration, radial glia act as stem cells for neurogenesis.58–60 In particular, radial 
glial cells in the developing cortex give rise to projection neurons, such as those that send 
axons in the pyramidal tracts to spinal cord motoneurons.61
Role of Microglial Cells in CNS Repair and Regeneration
Astrocytes, microglia, and Schwann cells react to neuronal injury by replication. They par-
ticipate in the removal of debris and in scar formation (see also Chapter 27).7,8,62 As a first 
step, resident microglial cells and macrophages, which invade damaged CNS from blood 
at the site of an injury divide, scavenge debris from dying cells. 
In the leech, the role of microglial cells in regeneration has been studied by Muller and 
his colleagues.63 (As an aside, it may be mentioned that it was in the CNS of the leech that 
such wandering cells first were given the name “microglia,” by del Rio-Hortega.64) Normally 
microglial cells are evenly distributed in leech ganglia and in the bundles of axons that link 
them (Figure 10.10). Immediately after damage to the CNS, microglial cells migrate to 
the site of the lesion, at a rate of about 300 μm/hour. There they accumulate, phagocytose 
damaged tissue, and produce laminin—a molecule that promotes neurite outgrowth (see

Chapter 25). What causes the microglial cells to become activated and to move rapidly to the 
place where the nervous system was damaged? Several lines of evidence show that microglia 
become activated to move by extracellular accumulation of ATP, which is released after 
injury. At the same time attraction toward the lesion, as opposed to random movement, is 
mediated by the gas nitric oxide (NO). NO activates a soluble guanylate cyclase that acts 
as an attractant for directed microglial migration.65,66 In mice, as in leeches, nitric oxide 
activates the migration of microglial cells towards spinal cord lesions.67
Schwann Cells as Pathways for Outgrowth in Peripheral Nerves
The way in which Schwann cells can guide axons and promote outgrowth has been dem-
onstrated in a series of experiments by Thompson and his colleagues.68–70 They took 
advantage of the visibility and accessibility of motor nerve terminals on skeletal muscle 
end plates (see Chapter 27). Figure 10.11A provides a diagrammatic summary of these 
experiments. In adult rats, the soleus muscle in the leg was partially denervated. In con-
firmation of earlier studies it was shown that uninjured motor axons sprouted to occupy 
denervated end plates. Under these circumstances, an axon can sprout to innervate up to 
five times the usual number of muscle fibers. Axon growth was visualized by an antibody 
against neurofilaments (red in Figure 10.11B). Schwann cells were stained with a different 
specific antibody (blue in Figure 10.11B). Direct observation showed that the first out-
growth consisted of Schwann cells that extended from denervated muscle fibers to reach

the intact axons (part c of Figure 10.11A). Only later did those axons sprout and follow 
the track laid down by Schwann cells. Implantation of Schwann cells next to an uninjured 
axon also promoted sprouting without a denervated target.
In other experiments a peripheral nerve was cut; as expected, after a short delay axons 
grew out from the proximal stump. Once again, however, the first step was the outgrowth of 
Schwann cell processes that provided the substrate on which the axons could subsequently 
grow toward their targets. Direct electrical stimulation of the partially denervated muscle 
reduced the number of bridges formed by Schwann cells and the ability of nerve fibers to 
grow along them.71
A Cautionary Note
Although experiments made at neuromuscular synapses clearly implicate Schwann cells in 
directing neurite outgrowth during regeneration, it seems prudent to limit the scope of such 
generalizations. For example, in the CNS of the leech, lesioned axons grow back to re-form 
their original connections after all the large glial cells surrounding them have been killed. 
Abundant connections and synapses are formed in embryonic CNS in which glial cells are 
sparsely distributed. Moreover, in the complete absence of neuroglial cells, synapses with an

seems unlikely that “synapses might neither form nor function if there were no glia.”73
Effects of Neuronal Activity on Glial Cells
Potassium Accumulation in Extracellular Space
That nerve activity can depolarize glial cells is illustrated by experiments shown in Figure 
10.12. The recordings were made from a glial cell in the optic nerve of the mud puppy 
(Necturus). Action potentials that are initiated in the nerve fibers by electrical stimulation 
or by flashes of light travel past the impaled glial cell, which becomes depolarized.74 The 
depolarization is graded. Similarly, in the mammalian cortex, glial cells become depolarized 
depending on the number of nerve fibers activated and on the frequency when neurons in 
their vicinity are activated by stimulation of neural tracts, peripheral nerves, the surface of 
the cortex, or sensory input.75 Astrocytes within an orientation column of the visual cortex 
are depolarized by visual stimuli of the appropriate orientation.76 77
The cause of glial depolarization is potassium efflux from axons. When potassium ac-
cumulates in the intercellular clefts, it changes the [K]o/[K]i ratio and alters the membrane 
potential of glial cells.
Changes in membrane potential in glial cells indicate the level of impulse traffic in 
their environment. Potassium signaling between neurons and glia is different from that in 
specific synaptic activity. Synaptic actions are confined to specialized regions on neuronal 
cell bodies and dendrites, and they may be excitatory or inhibitory. In contrast, signaling by 
potassium is not confined to structures containing receptors but occurs anywhere the glial 
cell is exposed to potassium. Neurons exposed to increased external potassium concentra-
tions become less depolarized than glia because the neuronal membrane deviates from the 
Nernst equation in the physiological range (see Chapter 6).

and the region that is occupied by a nerve impulse. Since glial cells are linked to each other 
by low-resistance connections,14 their conducting properties are similar to those of a single, 
elongated cell. Consequently, if several glial cells become depolarized by increased potassium 
concentrations in their environment, they draw current from the unaffected cells. Similarly, 
an elongated Müller cell that extends through the thickness of the retina generates current 
when the potassium concentration increases locally over part of its surface (Figure 10.13; 
see also Figure 10.5). Inward current in the region of raised [K]o, carried by potassium ions, 
spreads to other regions of the glial cell and through gap junctions to other glial cells. Cur-
rents generated by glial cells contribute to recordings made from the eye or the skull with 
extracellular electrodes. Such recordings, known as the electroretinogram (ERG) and the 
electroencephalogram (EEG) are valuable for the clinical diagnosis of pathological conditions.
Calcium Waves in Glial Cells 
In networks of glial cells in culture or in situ, transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium 
concentration arise by release from intracellular stores (see Figure 10.13). Using fluorescent 
indicators, one can observe such oscillatory waves of increased calcium concentration as 
they propagate from glial cell to glial cell through intercellular junctions.78 Pannexins, or 
hemi-junctions permeable to ATP, are present in extrajunctional glial cell membranes. As a 
result, ATP leaks out of activated glial cells into extracellular space.31 Calcium waves occur 
spontaneously79 or can be triggered by depolarization, by transmitters such as ATP,29 or by 
mechanical stimulation. They resemble the calcium waves seen in neuronal networks and in 
epithelial cells.80 Propagating intracellular calcium waves that trigger the release of ATP or 
glutamate can influence neuronal firing patterns (see below). There is evidence that calcium 
waves in cortical radial glia modulate the production of neurons during development.81

Spatial Buffering of Extracellular Potassium Concentration by Glia 
One obvious property of glial cells is to separate and group neuronal processes. As a result, 
the potassium concentration increases around some neurons while others in a separate 
compartment are protected. An attractive concept is that glial cells regulate the potassium 
concentration in intercellular clefts, a process known as spatial buffering.19,82 According to 
this hypothesis, glial cells act as conduits for uptake of potassium from the clefts to preserve 
the constancy of the environment.83 Since glial cells are coupled to each other, potassium 
enters in one region and leaves at another, as already described (Figure 10.14). That potas-
sium will move through glial cells as a consequence of potassium buildup is inevitable. It 
is, however, not simple to estimate quantitatively how much potassium actually moves or 
how much these movements reduce the extracellular potassium concentration. For such 
calculations, numerous assumptions about geometry, conductance, diffusion, and active 
transport of potassium into neurons and glial cells must be made.84
Glial Cells and Neurotransmitters
Transmitters such as GABA, glutamate, glycine, purines, and acetylcholine act on glial mem-
branes to produce depolarizing or hyperpolarizing responses.1,28,29,85,86 Figure 10.15 shows 
activation of GABAA receptors by GABA in retinal Müller cells. These GABA receptors are 
similar to those of neurons in many respects. Similarly, glial cell membranes contain receptors 
for ATP and glutamate, which depolarize, allow calcium to enter, and initiate calcium waves. 
Glial cells play a key role in transmitter uptake in the CNS, under normal and pathological 
conditions. The extracellular concentration of a transmitter such as glutamate, norepinephrine, 
or glycine that has been released at synapses is reduced in part by diffusion away from the site 
of release, but mainly by uptake into neurons and into glial cells.87–89 As in neurons, glutamate 
transport in glial cells is coupled to inward movement of sodium along its electrochemical gradi-
ent (see Chapter 9). In the absence of a removal mechanism, excessively high levels of external 
glutamate can activate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in neurons, which in turn can 
lead to calcium entry and cell death. Quantitative estimates indicate that glial cell transport 
plays a key role in preventing such excessive rises in extracellular glutamate concentration. 
Release of Transmitters by Glial Cells
If glial cells themselves become depolarized by raised extracellular potassium or by glu-
tamate, or if intracellular sodium concentration is increased, their membranes transport

spatial buffering of potassium has been pos-
tulated as a mechanism for influencing neu-
ronal function by glial cells. (B) Depolarization 
of the glial cell can cause calcium waves that

extracellular space.90,91 This mechanism is similar 
to that for reversed transport described in Chapter 
9. Figure 10.16 illustrates an experiment showing 
currents associated with glutamate release by glial 
cells. Such outward transport can exacerbate the 
deleterious effects of brain injury. Injured and dying 
nerve cells release glutamate and K+ and depolarize 
glial cells, which in turn release more glutamate.

cells is ATP.92 The mechanism for ATP however is

different from that used for glutamate. As previously mentioned, release of ATP from glial 
cells occurs through pannexin hemichannels during the spread of calcium waves from one 
glial cell to the next.31
One of the best-established demonstrations of transmitter release by a satellite cell 
occurs during regeneration in the peripheral nervous system. At denervated motor end 
plates, Schwann cells come to occupy the sites vacated by motor nerve terminals. There 
they release acetylcholine (ACh), giving rise to miniature potentials in muscle.93
Immediate Effects of Glial Cells on Synaptic Transmission 
The experiments described in preceding sections show that glial cells are important for devel-
opment, regeneration, and myelin formation; that their membranes contain ion channels and 
receptors; that they liberate and take up transmitters; and that they propagate calcium waves. 
A natural question that arises concerns the role of transmitters liberated from glial cells 
at neuronal synapses in the adult CNS. Do glutamate, serine, or ATP released by glia produce 
clear-cut, reproducible, and quantitatively measurable effects in synaptic transmission? This 
problem is at present being investigated in a number of different systems.33,91,94 Secretion of 
ATP by astrocytes has been implicated in the control of respiration by raised CO2
95levels, in 
increasing the frequency of AMPA receptor currents in cortical neurons,96and in influencing 
circadian rhythms of suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons in culture.97 
At the same time, problems of interpretation remain concerning the physiological role of 
glutamate released by chemical or electrical stimulation.98,99 Thus, no specialized, presynaptic 
release structures have been identified in adult glial cells in situ (see however De Biase et. 
al. 2010).15 A recent review from the laboratory of Attwell and his colleagues, who made 
pioneering experiments on the release of glutamate by glial cells, provides a cautionary note:
In the past 20 years, an extra layer of information processing, in addition to that 
provided by neurons, has been proposed for the CNS. Neuronally evoked increases 
of the intracellular calcium concentration in astrocytes have been suggested to trig-
ger exocytotic release of the ‘gliotransmitters’ glutamate, ATP and D-serine. These are 
proposed to modulate neuronal excitability and transmitter release, and to have a 
role in diseases as diverse as stroke, epilepsy, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease and 
HIV infection. However, there is intense controversy about whether astrocytes can 
exocytose transmitters in vivo. Resolving this issue would considerably advance our 
understanding of brain function. 100
By contrast, Newman and his colleagues have been able to use natural stimuli to activate 
transmitter liberation from glial cells. In the retina, signals evoked by light in Müller cells 
cause release of ATP and thereby inhibit ganglion cells.79,99,102 In summary, at present 
more is known about how neuronal activity affects glial signaling than about how glial 
signaling affects neuronal activity. There is as yet no compelling evidence that glial cells 
play any direct role in dynamic activities, such as the stretch reflex, or in the responses of 
a complex cell in the visual cortex under normal physiological conditions (see Chapter 2).
Glial Cells and the Blood–Brain Barrier
The close anatomical arrangement of glial cells, capillaries, and neurons in the brain sug-
gests that glial cells contribute to the blood–brain barrier (Box 10.1). The blood–brain bar-
rier is located at the junctions of specialized endothelial cells that line brain capillaries.103,104 
The role of glial cells has been shown by growing endothelial cells and astrocytes in culture. 
Grown on their own, endothelial cells are occasionally attached to each other. The presence of 
astrocytes, however, triggers the formation of complete bands of tight junctions resembling 
those seen in vivo.105 These junctions, which completely occlude the intercellular spaces be-
tween endothelial cells, account for the impermeability of brain capillaries. Molecules must 
go through, rather than between, endothelial cells. Conversely, the presence of endothelial 
cells from brain capillaries in culture causes distinctive assemblies of membrane particles to 
appear in astrocytes. These interactions are specific for astrocytes and brain-capillary endo-
thelial cells. No comparable results occur with fibroblasts or endothelial cells from peripheral 
vessels. Methods for promoting the uncoupling of endothelial cells to produce an increase in

capillary permeability are now being investigated. These experiments could provide a method 
for circumventing the blood–brain barrier (see the next section) and allowing therapeutically 
useful substances to enter the brain that would otherwise not be able to do so.106
Astrocytes and Blood Flow through the Brain
We can now take account of three facts to suggest a possible role for astrocytes in the 
mammalian brain. First, they envelop the brain capillaries with their end feet. (Indeed, it 
was this feature that led Golgi and so many others to suggest that they provide materials 
to the neurons.) Second, as we show in Chapter 3, neuronal activity in a particular region 
of the brain causes a dramatic localized increase in the blood flow through the tissue, as 
■  BOX 10.1 
The Blood–Brain Barrier
A homeostatic system controls the fluid environment in the 
brain and prevents fluctuations in its composition. This con-
stancy seems particularly important in a system in which the 
activity of so many cells is integrated and small variations may 
upset the balance of delicately poised excitatory and inhibitory 
influences.107,108 Within the brain, there are three fluid compart-
ments: (1) the blood supplied to the brain through a dense 
network of capillaries, (2) the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that sur-
rounds the bulk of the nervous system and is contained in the 
internal cavities (ventricles), and (3) the fluid in the intercellular 
clefts (Figure I). 
The blood–brain barrier depends on specialized proper-
ties of the endothelial cells of capillaries in the brain, which 
are far less permeable than those supplying organs in the 
periphery.104,105 Proteins, ions, and hydrophilic molecules 
cannot pass through the blood–brain barrier, while lipophilic 
molecules (such as alcohol) and gases can. A second es-
sential component of the blood–brain barrier is the choroid 
plexus: Specialized epithelial cells surround the choroid 
plexus capillaries and secrete CSF (Figure IIA).109 CSF itself 
is almost devoid of protein, containing only about 1/200 of 
the amount present in blood plasma. Proteins, electrolytes, 
transmitters, and a variety of drugs, including penicillin, 
injected directly into the bloodstream act rapidly on periph-
eral tissues such as muscle, heart, or glands—but they have 
little or no effect on the CNS. When administered by way of 
the CSF, however, the same substances exert a prompt and 
strong action.

measured by positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
or optical recording. Third, glial cells register the overall level of activity of the neurons 
in their vicinity. Paulson and Newman111 long ago put forward an attractive and original 
idea: they suggested that end feet of depolarized astrocytes might act on capillaries to cause 
localized vasodilatation. Several lines of evidence provided by Newman and others indi-
cate that glial cells activated by neuronal activity do in fact cause changes in blood flow. 
Thus, through glial signaling, active neurons can be supplied with extra oxygen and glu-
cose. Figure 10.17 shows dilatation of blood vessels of the retina in situ following calcium 
waves in Müller radial glial cells.112 As for mechanisms, recent experiments have provided 
■  BOX 10.1 (continued)
Within the brain, ions and small particles reach neurons by 
passing through the narrow 20 nm intercellular clefts and not 
through glia. In Figure IIB, after injection of microperoxidase into 
CSF, electron-dense molecules deposited by peroxidase reac-
tion are lined up in clefts and fill extracellular spaces. This result 
shows that large molecules can pass between the ependymal 
cells that line the ventricles and through intercellular clefts. In 
contrast, the junctions between endothelial cells lining the blood 
capillaries in the brain provide a barrier. Tracers injected into 
CSF do not enter the capillaries. Figure IIC shows the opposite 
result. When enzyme was injected into the circulation, brain 
capillaries filled with enzyme but none entered the intercellular 
spaces. During development the barrier is already present, but 
the range of substances that can enter the CSF is qualitatively 
and quantitatively different.110 Knowledge of blood–brain barrier 
properties is important for understanding pharmacological ac-
tions of drugs and their effects on the body.

between the choroid epithelial cells, which secrete CSF. 
There are no barriers between the bulk fluid of CSF and 
the various cell layers, such as ependyma, glia, and 
neurons. The endothelial cells lining brain capillaries are 
joined by circumferential junctions. This prevents free 
diffusion of molecules out of the blood into the brain 
tissue or from the brain into the blood. (B) Demonstra-

conflicting results about whether it is ATP or potassium that acts on capillary endothelial 
cells.113–115 Nevertheless, Paulson and Newman’s suggestion has been confirmed; ironically 
it is reminiscent of Golgi’s original idea, which it reproduces, but with signals flowing in the 
opposite direction. Instead of glial cells carrying nutrients through their cytoplasm from 
blood to neurons, neuronal activity leads to highly localized vasodilatation and increased 
blood flow just where it is needed. 
Transfer of Metabolites from Glial Cells to Neurons 
While the previous paragraph shows that glial cells influence cerebral blood flow, the hy-
pothesis that nutrients are transferred to neurons through glial cells has been harder to 
prove by direct experiments. Several lines of evidence in invertebrates indicate that glial 
cells supply lactate to nerve cells. It has been proposed that lactate, rather than glucose, is 
taken up by active neurons to provide their prime source of energy.116,117 The demonstra-
tion of such transfer in invertebrates and vertebrate neurons in culture has suggested a 
similar role for glial cells within the intact central nervous system under conditions of high 
neuronal activity or anoxia. However, in intact animals it is a major task to make direct 
measurements of the amount of lactate liberated, the increase in concentration, or the 
timing of release and uptake in relation to neuronal activity118 (see review by Fillenz119). 
Glial Cells and Immune Responses of the CNS
In the past it was generally accepted that the tissues of the central nervous system were not 
patrolled by the surveillance mechanisms of the immune system. The blood–brain barrier, the 
absence of a lymphatic system, and the comparative ease with which grafts can be accepted 
all suggest the absence of immune responses to foreign antigens. Thus, CNS functions are 
not disrupted by the massive allergic reactions to a bee sting or poison ivy. Astrocytes in 
culture and in situ, however, have been shown to react with T lymphocytes, whose activity 
they can either stimulate or suppress. Evidence has now accumulated to show that microglia 
and activated T lymphocytes do enter the brain and can mediate acute inflammation of 
brain tissue.120–122 The role played by glial cells in interactions between the immune system 
and the nervous system still represents an interesting and challenging problem.

■ PART III
Intercellular Communication
In Part II we described how ionic and electrical gradients are maintained 
across a nerve cell membrane, how these gradients are used to generate 
electrical impulses (action potentials), and how these impulses are con-
ducted along the processes of the nerve cell (the axons). Now we have to 
consider what happens when the impulse gets to the end of the axon: how 
is this information transmitted to another neuron or to an effector cell such 
as a muscle cell?
In most cases the information is transmitted across specialized contact 
zones called synapses. The process is termed synaptic transmission. In 
some instances the presynaptic action potential is conducted electrotonically 
across the synapse to directly depolarize the postsynaptic neuron—electrical 
transmission. More commonly, however, the presynaptic action potential in-
duces the release of a chemical transmitter substance that binds to special-
ized target proteins (receptors) on the postsynaptic membrane. This process 
is called chemical transmission.
In Chapters 11 and 12 we describe two forms of chemical transmission—
one in which the transmitter substance actually binds to, and opens, an ion 
channel, to produce a very rapid, brief postsynaptic response (direct trans-
mission), and one in which the transmitter binds to a different type of recep-
tor to produce a slow, long-lasting postsynaptic effect by inducing a cas-
cade of intracellular changes (indirect transmission). Then in Chapter 13 we 
go back to the presynaptic nerve endings and discuss how the transmitter is 
stored in them and how it is released by the presynaptic action potential. 
In fact, there are a large number of different chemical transmitter substances 
in the nervous system, which makes it possible to selectively modify trans-
mission at some synapses and not at others using specific chemicals and 
drugs. The pathways using the different transmitters and some of their ac-
tions on individual neurons and on overall brain function are summarized in 
Chapter 14. Chapter 15 gives more information about the synthesis, storage 
and inactivation of these transmitters.
Finally, in Chapter 16 we consider how the efficiency of transmission across 
synapses can show long-lasting increases or decreases depending on the 
amount of synaptic traffic (synaptic plasticity); this is important, for example, 
in the establishment of memory.


■ CHAPTER 11
Mechanisms of Direct 
Synaptic Transmission
S
ynapses are points of contact between nerve cells and their targets where signals are 
handed on from one cell to the next. This process of synaptic transmission may be mediat-
ed through the release of a chemical neurotransmitter substance from the nerve terminal by 
the incoming action potential (chemical transmission) or, at certain junctions, by the direct spread 
of electric current from the presynaptic neuron to the postsynaptic cell (electrical transmission). 
At direct chemical synapses, the transmitter binds to receptors in the membrane of the post-
synaptic cell that are themselves ion channels (ionotropic receptors). As a result, the conformation 
of the receptor changes, the channel opens, ions flow, and the membrane potential changes—all 
within a millisecond or so. A slower process, indirect chemical transmission, involving additional, 
intermediary steps, is described in Chapter 12. 
The channels opened at excitatory synapses allow cations to enter, driving the membrane 
potential toward threshold. At inhibitory synapses, transmitters open channels that are permeable 
to anions, tending to keep the membrane potential negative to threshold. At both excitatory and 
inhibitory synapses, the direction of current flow is determined by the balance of concentration 
and electrical gradients acting on the permeant ions.
Synapses between motor nerves and skeletal muscle fibers provide important preparations for 
understanding the mechanisms of direct chemical synaptic transmission. In the mammalian cen-
tral nervous system (CNS), directly mediated excitation occurs at synapses where the transmitter 
(usually glutamate) activates excitatory ionotropic receptors. Inhibitory synaptic transmission in 
the CNS is mediated by release of transmitters (usually γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA] or glycine) that 
activate inhibitory ionotropic receptors.
More than one type of transmitter may be released at a single chemical synapse, and many 
transmitters act both rapidly, by binding to and opening ion channels directly, and more slowly 
through indirect mechanisms. In another process known as presynaptic inhibition, a chemical 
transmitter acts on the presynaptic nerve ending to reduce the amount of neurotransmitter re-
leased. Electrical transmission occurs at synapses specialized for very fast reflex responses and 
also in the mammalian CNS, where it helps to coordinate nerve cell activity.

186 Chapter 11
Synaptic Transmission
Action potentials travel down large motor axons or up large sensory axons, at speeds of 
up to 120 meters per second and at intervals down to 5 ms or so. It would seem rather 
pointless if there were then a long delay before the muscle fiber, or the next neuron, could 
be informed of the action potential’s arrival. Accordingly, there are specialized junctions 
between one cell and another called synapses. These enable the recipient cell to respond 
within less than a millisecond of the action potential’s arrival at the nerve terminal. For 
a long time it was unclear how such a fast transmission process could occur (Box 11.1). 
One possibility, widely held until the early 1950s, was that the electrical current in the 
presynaptic terminal spread passively to the postsynaptic cell (i.e., electrical transmission, 
Figure 11.1A). The alternative suggestion was that the information was transmitted by 
the local release and action of a chemical neurotransmitter (i.e., chemical transmission, 
Figure 11.1B). In fact, it is now clear that chemical transmission is the prevalent mode 
of synaptic communication in the vertebrate central and peripheral nervous system. 
However, electrical transmission is used at certain invertebrate and vertebrate synapses 
specialized for very fast responses, and it has become increasingly apparent that a form 
of supplementary electrical transmission is also quite widely used in the mammalian 
central nervous system as a mechanism for coordinating the electrical activity of groups 
of neurons. In this chapter we start by discussing chemical transmission, then consider 
examples of electrical transmission. 
Chemical Synaptic Transmission
Certain obvious questions arise when one considers the elaborate scheme necessary 
for chemical synaptic transmission, which entails the secretion of a specific chemical 
by a nerve terminal and its interaction with specific postsynaptic receptors (see Figure 
11.1B). How does the terminal liberate the chemical? Is there a special feature of the 
action potential mechanism that causes secretion? How is the interaction of a trans-
mitter with its postsynaptic receptor rapidly converted into excitation or inhibition? 
The release process will be considered in detail in Chapter 13; the present discussion is 
concerned with the question of how transmitters act on the postsynaptic cell at direct 
chemical synapses. 
Many of the pioneering studies of chemical synaptic transmission were done on rela-
tively simple preparations, such as the skeletal neuromuscular junction of the frog. At the 
time, this particular preparation had the advantage that the neurotransmitter acetylcholine 
(ACh) had been definitively identified, while the transmitters at synapses in the CNS were 
completely unknown (see Chapter 14).

Mechanisms of Direct Synaptic Transmission 187
■  BOX 11.1 
Electrical or Chemical Transmission?
In the second half of the nineteenth century there was vigorous 
debate between proponents of the cell theory, who consid-
ered that neurons were independent units, and those who 
thought that nerve cells were a syncytium interconnected by 
protoplasmic bridges. Not until the late nineteenth century did 
it become generally accepted that nerve cells are independent 
units. This disagreement about synaptic structure was ac-
companied by a parallel disagreement about function. In 1843, 
Du Bois-Reymond showed that flow of electrical current was 
involved in both muscle contraction and nerve conduction, and 
it required only a small extension of this idea to conclude that 
transmission of excitation from nerve to muscle was also due 
to current flow (see Figure 11.1A).1 Du Bois-Reymond himself 
favored an alternative explanation: the secretion by the nerve 
terminal of an excitatory substance that then caused muscle 
contraction (see Figure 11.1B). However, the idea of animal 
electricity had such a potent hold on people’s thinking that it 
was more than 100 years before contrary evidence finally over-
came the assumption of electrical transmission between nerve 
and muscle and, by extension, between nerve cells in general. 
One reason why the idea of chemical synaptic transmis-
sion seemed unattractive is the speed of signaling between 
nerve cells or between nerve and muscle. The fraction of a 
second that intervenes between stimulation of a motor axon 
and contraction of the corresponding muscle did not appear 
to provide sufficient time for a chemical neurotransmitter to 
be released from the nerve terminal and 
interact with receptors on the postsynaptic 
target to cause excitation. This difficulty 
did not exist in the autonomic nervous 
system, which controls glands and blood 
vessels, where the effects of nerve stimula-
tion are slow and prolonged (see Chapter 
17). Thus, the first explicit suggestion of 
chemical transmission came from experi-
ments on the sympathetic nervous system 
by T. R. Elliot in 1904.2 He noted that an 
extract from the adrenal gland, adrena-
line (epinephrine), mimicked the action 
of sympathetic nerve stimulation when 
applied directly to the target tissues and 
concluded with the words “Adrenalin might 
then be the chemical stimulant liberated on 
each occasion when the impulse arrives 
at the periphery.” This was not pursued 
further at that time, but instead, in 1921 
Otto Loewi did a direct and simple experi-
ment that established the chemical nature 
of   at autonomic synapses between the 
vagus nerve and the heart.3 He perfused 
the heart of a frog and stimulated the va-
gus nerve, thereby slowing the heartbeat. When the fluid from 
the inhibited heart was transferred to a second unstimulated 
heart, it too began to beat more slowly. Apparently, stimula-
tion of the vagus nerve had caused an inhibitory substance 
to be released into the perfusate. In subsequent experiments, 
Loewi and his colleagues demonstrated that the substance 
was mimicked in every way by acetylcholine (ACh).
It is an amusing sidelight that Loewi had the idea for his 
experiment in a dream, wrote it down in the middle of the 
night, but could not decipher his writing the next morning. 
Fortunately, the dream returned, and this time Loewi took no 
chances; he rushed to the laboratory and performed the ex-
periment. Later he reflected:
On mature consideration, in the cold light of morning, 
I would not have done it. After all, it was an unlikely 
enough assumption that the vagus should secrete 
an inhibitory substance; it was still more unlikely 
that a chemical substance that was supposed to be 
effective at very close range between nerve terminal 
and muscle be secreted in such large amounts that 
it would spill over and, after being diluted by the 
perfusion fluid, still be able to inhibit another heart. 3
Subsequently, in the early 1930s, the role of ACh in synaptic 
transmission in ganglia in the autonomic nervous system was 
firmly established by Feldberg and his colleagues.4 Highlights of 
such experiments and ideas from the beginning of the twentieth 
century are contained in the writings of Dale, who for several 
decades was one of the leading figures in British physiology and 
pharmacology.5 Among his many contributions are the clarifica-
tion of the action of acetylcholine at synapses 
in autonomic ganglia and the establishment 
of its role in neuromuscular transmission. 
Thus, in 1936, Dale and his colleagues dem-
onstrated that acetylcholine was released 
by stimulating the motor nerves supplying 
skeletal muscle,6 and then that application 
of ACh to the muscle caused contraction 
and that the effects of both ACh and motor 
nerve stimulation were blocked by curare 
(see Box 11.2).5 
The idea of chemical transmission be-
tween one nerve cell and another, particular-
ly in the mammalian central nervous system, 
took rather longer to become accepted. 
There were several reasons for this. First, 
there were no model synapses to study that 
were comparable to the frog neuromuscular 
junction (see below). Second, the chemical 
transmitters in the central nervous system 
were not known (acetylcholine is not the 
main transmitter), so there were no good 
pharmacological tools to use. Third, neuron-
to-neuron transmission could only be stud-
ied using electrical recording techniques, 
which (one suspects) might have led the investigators to think in 
terms of electrical current flow. One of the most ardent propo-

Synaptic Structure
As always, knowledge of structure is a prerequisite for understanding function. Figure 11.2 
illustrates the principal morphological features of the neuromuscular junction of the frog. 
Individual axons branch from the incoming motor nerve, lose their myelin sheath, and give 
off terminal branches that run in shallow grooves on the surface of the muscle. The syn-
aptic cleft between the terminal and the muscle membrane is about 30 nanometers (nm) 
wide. Within the cleft is the basal lamina, which follows the contours of the muscle fiber 
surface. On the muscle, postjunctional folds radiate into the muscle fiber from the cleft at 
regular intervals. The grooves and folds are peculiar to skeletal muscle and are not a general 
feature of chemical synapses. In skeletal muscle, the region of postsynaptic specialization 
is known as the motor end plate. Schwann cell lamellae cover the nerve terminal, sending 
fingerlike processes around it at regularly spaced intervals. 
Within the cytoplasm of the terminal, clusters of synaptic vesicles are associated with 
electron-dense material attached to the presynaptic membrane, forming active zones. 
Synaptic vesicles are sites of ACh storage; upon excitation of the axon terminal, they fuse 
with the presynaptic membrane at the active zone to spill their contents into the synaptic 
cleft by exocytosis (see Chapter 13). 
Synapses on nerve cells are usually made by nerve terminal swellings called boutons, 
which are separated from the postsynaptic membrane by the synaptic cleft. The presyn-
aptic membrane of the bouton displays electron-dense regions with associated clusters of 
synaptic vesicles, forming active zones similar to, but smaller than, those seen in skeletal 
muscle (Figure 11.2C). At nerve–nerve synapses the postsynaptic membrane often appears 
thickened and has electron-dense material associated with it.
Synaptic Potentials at the Neuromuscular Junction
Early studies by Eccles, Katz, and Kuffler used extracellular recording techniques to study 
the end-plate potential (EPP) in muscle.10–12 The EPP is the depolarization of the end-plate 
region of the muscle fiber following motor nerve excitation, produced by acetylcholine 
released from the presynaptic nerve terminals. Synaptic potentials similar to these are seen 
in nerve cells. A synaptic potential that excites a postsynaptic cell is usually referred to as 
an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), and one that inhibits is called an inhibitory 
postsynaptic potential (IPSP). 
Normally the amplitude of the end-plate potential in a skeletal muscle fiber is much 
greater than that needed to initiate an action potential. The amplitude can be reduced by 
■  BOX 11.1 (continued)
nents of the electrical transmission theory was J. C. Eccles. 
However, he became converted to the chemical hypothesis 
when he and his colleagues first used microelectrodes to record 
from inside a motor neuron in the spinal cord of an anesthetized 
cat. There, they found that stimulation of excitatory or inhibitory 
afferent nerves produced changes in the membrane potential of 
the motor neuron in opposite directions.7 (The nature of these 
potentials is described in more detail below). They could not 
explain the opposite polarity of the inhibitory response on their 
previous electrical hypothesis, so they wrote:
It may therefore be concluded that inhibitory synaptic 
action is mediated by a specific transmitter substance 
that is liberated from the inhibitory synaptic knobs and 
causes an increase in polarization of the subjacent 
membrane of the motoneurone.7
Interestingly, not long after chemical transmission was 
firmly established as the accepted form of synaptic activation, 
in 1959, Furshpan and Potter found electrical transmission of 
excitation between giant axons in the crayfish.8 Then, in 1963, 
electrical synaptic transmission was reported in the avian 
ciliary ganglion.9 Examples of electrical transmission have 
multiplied manyfold since then, and we now we know that 
both chemical and electrical synapses are abundant in both 
vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems.

is reduced to below threshold, so that it is no longer obscured by the action potential

sional sketch of part of the terminal arbor of a motor axon at the frog 
skeletal neuromuscular junction. Inset shows several skeletal muscle 
fibers and their innervation. Synaptic vesicles are clustered in the nerve 
terminal in special regions opposite the openings of the postjunctional 
folds. These regions, called active zones, are the sites of transmitter re-
lease into the synaptic cleft. Fingerlike processes of Schwann cells ex-
tend between the terminal and the postsynaptic membrane, separating 
active zones. (B) Electron micrograph of a longitudinal section through 
a portion of the neuromuscular junction. In the nerve terminal, clusters 
of vesicles lie over thickenings in the presynaptic membrane—the ac-
tive zones (arrows). Schwann cell processes (S) separate the clusters. 
In the muscle, postjunctional folds open into the synaptic cleft directly 
under the active zone. The band of fuzzy material in the cleft, which fol-
lows the contours of the postjunctional folds, is the synaptic basal lam-
ina. (C) Electron micrograph of synapses in the central nervous system

Drugs and Toxins Acting at the Neuromuscular Junction
Agonists, antagonists, and potentiators
Drugs have frequently been used to increase our understand-
ing of neuromuscular transmission. These fall into two classes: 
drugs that act directly on the acetylcholine receptors and 
those that inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which is 
responsible for the hydrolysis and inactivation of acetylcholine 
(see Appendix B).
Drugs acting on acetylcholine receptors
There are two types of these drugs: agonists, which stimulate 
the receptors and open the nicotinic channels; and antago-
nists, which bind to the receptors but do not open the ion 
channels, and so block the action of acetylcholine. Agonists 
include: acetylcholine itself (1), the natural agonist; some syn-
thetic choline esters, such as carbamoylcholine (carbachol); 
and the plant alkaloid nicotine (2), from which the recep-
tors get their name. Antagonists include: tubocurarine (3), a 
component of curare (a mixture of alkaloids extracted from 
the South American plants Strychnos toxifera and Chondro-
dendron tomentosum, which was used as an arrow poison 
to paralyze prey); and α-bungarotoxin, a component of the 
venom of the Taiwanese banded krait Bungarus multicinctus. 
Tubocurarine is a reversible blocking agent (see Box 11.3). 
Drugs with a similar mechanism of action are used to relax 
skeletal muscles during surgery. Bungarotoxin binds irrevers-
ibly to the ACh receptors and is used experimentally to count 
or see the receptors (as shown in Figure 11.7). 
Drugs that inhibit acetylcholinesterase 
(anticholinesterases)
These include neostigmine (4) and physostigmine or eserine 
(5). At the neuromuscular junction, they do not alter the peak 
amplitude of the end-plate currents but rather slow their 
decay rate by about three times.13,14 This is because the 
released acetylcholine is not hydrolyzed and so stays longer 
in the synaptic cleft, until it is cleared by diffusion; this allows 
the acetylcholine that is released by a single nerve impulse 
to stimulate the nicotinic receptors several times. Anticho-
linesterases have much more effect on the response of the 
end plate to ACh in the bathing solution, because a high 
proportion of the acetylcholine is normally hydrolyzed by the 
cholinesterase in the neuromuscular junction before it can 
access the receptors. The drugs can be 
used to reverse the blocking effect of 
tubocurarine or to improve the muscle 
response in diseases in which neuro-
muscular transmission is defective, such 
as myasthenia.
Anticholinesterase drugs have a more 
dramatic effect on both the amplitude and 
duration of the slow synaptic responses 
mediated by muscarinic acetylcholine 
receptors15 (see Chapters 12 and 13). 
The reasons are that the muscarinic 
receptors are further away from the pre-
synaptic nerve endings than the nicotinic 
receptors, so more of the released ACh is 
hydrolyzed before it reaches the recep-
tors. In addition, the muscarinic recep-
tors are 100 to 1000 times more sensitive 
than nicotinic receptors to acetylcholine 
so a low concentration of residual unhy-
drolyzed acetylcholine has a large effect. 
This underlies their limited use in treating 
Alzheimer’s disease (see Chapter 14).

■  BOX 11.3 
Action of Tubocurarine at the Motor End Plate
Reversible competitive antagonism
Tubocurarine acts as a reversible competitive antagonist of 
acetylcholine at the motor end plate (see Box 11.2), which 
means that it readily dissociates from the acetylcholine recep-
tors and that its blocking action can be overcome by increas-
ing the concentration of acetylcholine. Competition occurs 
because both molecules only bind transiently to the receptors. 
So, when an ACh molecule detaches from the receptors, a tu-
bocurarine molecule may take its place; and conversely, when 
the tubocurarine dissociates, ACh may take its place. The 
probability of one or the other substance occupying the re-
ceptor then depends on: (1) the relative number of molecules 
of each substance available (i.e., on their relative concentra-
tions) and (2) on the relative times for which they occupy the 
receptor. Thus, tubocurarine binds to the receptor about 100 
times longer than acetylcholine; so for equal concentrations, 
the competition is weighted in favor of tubocurarine, but this 
would be equalized if the concentration of ACh were 100 
times greater. This competition can be quantified as shown 
below.
Take a simple reversible reaction between agonist (A) and 
receptor (R): 
A + R ↔ AR
 
KA
where KA is the equilibrium dissociation constant. Then the 
proportion of receptors occupied by the agonist at equilibrium 
(PAR) in the absence of antagonist may be given by:
PAR = [A]/{[A] + KA}
where [A] = concentration of A. 
When the antagonist B is also present, the new receptor 
that is occupied by the agonist (PAR(B)) is now given by: 
PAR(B) = [A]/{[A] + KA(1 + [B]/KB)}
where [B] is the concentration of B and KB is the equilibrium 
dissociation constant for the reaction B + R ↔ BR. This is 
called the Gaddum equation16 (see17 for a full derivation). Thus, 
to get the same response to the agonist in the presence of 
the antagonist as that seen before adding the antagonist, the 
concentration of agonist must be increased from A to AB such 
that AB / A = {1 + [B] / KB}. The term AB / A is frequently called 
the dose ratio, or DR, and the relationship: 
DR – 1 = [B]/KB
is known as the Schild equation.18 
In a classic piece of work, Donald Jenkinson19 tested this 
out for tubocurarine, and acetylcholine antagonism in frog 
muscle. He measured the depolarization produced by ACh in 
the presence of increasing concentrations of tubocurarine and 
then plotted DR–1 against the concentration of tubocurarine 
([B]) on a double-logarithmic scale. As shown in Figure 11.4, 
this followed a linear relation over a thousand-fold range of tu-
bocurarine concentrations. This provides convincing evidence 
for true competitive inhibition. Subsequent work20 revealed 
that tubocurarine could also block the nicotinic receptor ion 
channels. However, this only becomes significant at more 
hyperpolarized membrane potentials (–120 mV) than those in 
Jenkinson’s experiments or those in muscle fibers in vivo.

The intracellular microelectrode21 was used by Fatt and Katz22,23 to study in detail the 
time course and spatial distribution of the end-plate potential in muscle fibers treated with 
curare. They stimulated the motor nerve and recorded the end-plate potential intracellularly 
at various distances from the end plate (Figure 11.4). At the end plate the depolarization 
rose rapidly to a peak and then declined slowly over the next 10 to 20 ms. As they moved the 
recording microelectrode farther and farther away from the end plate, the end-plate potential 
amplitude became progressively smaller and its time to peak progressively longer. Fatt and 
Katz showed that after reaching its peak, the end-plate potential decayed at a rate that was

consistent with the time constant of the muscle fiber membrane, and that the decrement 
in end-plate potential peak amplitude with distance from the end plate was predicted by 
the muscle fiber cable properties. Accordingly, they concluded that the end plate potential 
is generated by a brief surge of current that flows into the muscle fiber locally at the end 
plate and causes a rapid depolarization. The potential then spreads passively beyond the 
end plate in both directions, becoming smaller with increasing distance.
Mapping the Region of the Muscle Fiber Receptive to ACh
The existence of special properties of skeletal muscle fibers in the region of innervation has 
been known since the beginning of the twentieth century. For example, Langley24 assumed 
the presence of a “receptive substance” around motor nerve terminals, based on the finding 
that this region of the muscle fiber was particularly sensitive to various chemical agents, 
such as nicotine. This conclusion showed amazing insight since it was inconceivable that 
nicotine could play a physiological role at neuromuscular junctions. After the introduc-
tion of the glass microelectrode for intracellular recording, microelectrodes were also used 
for discrete application of ACh (and later other drugs as well) to the end plate region of 
muscle.25 The technique is illustrated in Figure 11.5A.
A microelectrode is inserted into the end plate of a muscle fiber for recording membrane 
potentials, while an ACh-filled micropipette is held just outside the fiber. To apply ACh, a brief 
positive voltage pulse is applied to the top of the pipette, causing a spurt of positively charged 
ACh ions to leave the pipette tip. This method of ejecting charged molecules from pipettes 
is known as ionophoresis.25 Using this method of application, del Castillo and Katz showed 
that ACh depolarized the muscle fiber only at the end-plate region and only when applied 
to the outside of the fiber.26 When the ACh-filled pipette is placed in close apposition to the 
end-plate region, the response to ionophoresis is rapid (Figure 11.5B). Movement of the pipette 
by only a few micrometers results in a reduction in amplitude and slowing of the response.

Mechanisms of Direct Synaptic Transmission 193
The receptive substance postulated by Langley is now known to be the nicotinic ACh 
receptor. The technique of ionophoresis made it possible to map with high accuracy the 
distribution of postsynaptic ACh receptors in muscle fibers27 and nerve cells.28 This method 
is particularly useful with thin preparations in which the presynaptic and postsynaptic 
structures can be resolved with interference contrast optics,29 and the position of the 
ionophoretic pipette in relation to the synapse can be determined with precision. 
One such preparation is the neuromuscular junction of the snake, shown in Figure 11.6. 
The end plates in snake muscle are about 50 micrometers (μm) in diameter, resembling

in their compactness those seen in mammals. Each axon terminal consists of 50 to 70 
terminal swellings, analogous to synaptic boutons, from which transmitter is released. The 
swellings rest in craters sunk into the surface of the muscle fiber. An electron micrograph 
of such a synapse is shown in Figure 11.6B, again illustrating the characteristic features 
observed at all chemical synapses. Figure11.6C shows an electron micrograph of a typi-
cal ionophoretic micropipette. The opening is about 50 nm, similar in size to a synaptic 
vesicle. In this preparation, the motor nerve terminals can be removed by bathing the 
muscle in a solution of the enzyme collagenase, which frees the terminal without damag-
ing the muscle fiber.30,31 Each of the boutons then leaves behind a circumscribed crater 
lined with the exposed postsynaptic membrane, so that the ACh-filled micropipette can be 
placed directly on the postsynaptic membrane. Then 1 picocoulomb (pC) of charge passed 
through the pipette releases enough ACh to cause, on the average, a 5-mV depolarization. 
The sensitivity of the membrane is then said to be 5000 mV/nanocoulomb (nC) (Figure 
11.6D). In contrast, at a distance of about 2 μm, just outside the crater, the same amount 
of ACh produces a response that is 50 to 100 times smaller. Along the rims of the craters, 
the sensitivity fluctuates over a wide range. Therefore, the conclusion from physiological 
mapping is that the ACh receptors are highly concentrated in the region of the synapse. 
Morphological Demonstration of the Distribution of ACh Receptors
Another way to determine the distribution of ACh receptors is to use α-bungarotoxin, the 
snake toxin that binds highly selectively and irreversibly to nicotinic ACh receptors. The 
distribution of bound toxin can be visualized using histochemical techniques. For example, 
fluorescent markers can be attached to α-bungarotoxin and the distribution of receptors 
visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 11.7A); or the enzyme horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP) can be linked to α-bungarotoxin and its dense reaction product visualized in the 
electron microscope (Figure 11.7B).32 Such techniques confirm that receptors are highly 
restricted to the membrane immediately beneath the axon terminal. Even more precise 
quantitative estimates of the concentration of ACh receptors than these can be obtained

using radioactive α-bungarotoxin and autoradiography (Figure 11.7C).33 By counting the 
number of silver grains exposed in the emulsion, the density of receptors can be deter-
mined. In muscle the density is highest along the crests and upper third of the junctional 
folds (about 104/μm2); the density in extrasynaptic regions is much lower (about 5/μm2).34
Transmitter receptors are highly concentrated in the postsynaptic membrane at synapses 
throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems.
Measurement of Ionic Currents Produced by ACh
How does ACh produce an inward current at the end plate? Experiments by Fatt and Katz 
led them to conclude that ACh produces a marked, nonspecific increase in permeability 
of the postsynaptic membrane to small ions.22 Two techniques were subsequently used 
to assess the permeability changes produced by ACh. One involved the use of radioactive 
isotopes, which showed that the permeability of the postsynaptic membrane was increased 
to sodium, potassium, and calcium but not to chloride.35 This experiment provided con-
vincing evidence concerning the ion species involved but did not reveal the details of the 
conductance changes, their timing, or their voltage dependence. Precise information was 
provided by voltage clamp experiments, first performed by A. and N. Takeuchi, who used 
two microelectrodes to voltage clamp the end-plate region of muscle fibers.36 The experi-
mental arrangement is shown in Figure 11.8A. Two microelectrodes were inserted into 
the end-plate region of a frog muscle fiber—one for recording membrane potential (Vm), 
the other for injecting current to clamp the membrane potential at the desired level. The 
nerve was then stimulated to release ACh or, in later experiments, ACh was applied directly 
by ionophoresis. Subsequently, similar experiments were carried out by Magleby and Ste-

vens37 in muscle fibers treated with hypertonic glycerol. This stops the muscle fibers from 
contracting, though leaving the fibers in an artificially depolarized state.
Figure 11.8B illustrates results from such a glycerol-treated muscle fiber. With the muscle 
membrane potential clamped at –40 mV, nerve stimulation produced an inward current, 
which would have caused a depolarization if the fiber had not been voltage clamped. At 
more-negative holding potentials, the end-plate current increased in amplitude. When the 
membrane was depolarized, the end-plate current decreased in amplitude. With further 
depolarization, the current reversed direction and was outward.
Figure 11.8C shows a plot of the peak amplitude of the end-plate current as a function 
of holding potential. The current changed from inward to outward near zero membrane 
potential. This is called the reversal potential, Vr. In earlier experiments on intact muscle 
fibers, A. and N. Takeuchi estimated the reversal potential to be about –15 mV.
Significance of the Reversal Potential
The reversal potential for the end-plate current gives us information about the ionic currents 
flowing through the channels activated by ACh in the postsynaptic membrane. For example, 
if the channels were permeable exclusively to sodium, then current through the channels 
would be zero at the sodium equilibrium potential (about +50 mV). The other major ions, 
potassium and chloride, have equilibrium potentials near –90 mV, which is the normal resting 
membrane potential (see Chapter 6). The calcium equilibrium potential is approximately +120 
mV. None of the ions has an equilibrium potential in the range of 0 to –15 mV. What ions, 
then, are involved in the response? Consistent with the results of radioactive tracer experi-
ments,35 A. and N. Takeuchi showed that changing the concentrations of sodium, potassium, 
or calcium in the bathing solution resulted in changes in the reversal potential, but changes 
in extracellular chloride did not.38 They concluded that the effect of ACh was to produce a 
general increase in cation permeability.
Relative Contributions of Sodium, Potassium,
and Calcium to the End-Plate Potential
ACh opens channels that, at the normal resting potential, allow sodium and calcium ions 
to leak inward and potassium ions to leak outward along their electrochemical gradients. 
Because the calcium conductance of the channels is small, the contribution of calcium to 
the overall synaptic current can be ignored, as can that of other cations such as magne-
sium. (It should be noted that the low calcium conductance is due to its low extracellular 
and intracellular concentrations; calcium permeability is about 20% of the sodium perme-
ability.) The equivalent electrical circuit is shown in Figure 11.9A. The resting membrane 
consists of the usual sodium, potassium, and chloride channels. It is in parallel with ACh-
activated channels for sodium and potassium, ΔgNa and ΔgK. The Takeuchis calculated that 
for a reversal potential Vr = –15 mV, the ratio of the sodium to potassium conductance 
changes, ΔgNa/ΔgK, is about 1.3 (Box 11.4). The channel opened by ACh is, in fact, nearly 
equally permeable to sodium and potassium.39,40 However, taking the extracellular and 
intracellular solutions together, there are more sodium than potassium ions available to 
move through the channels (see Chapter 6). Thus, for the same permeability change, the 
sodium conductance change is slightly larger (see Chapter 4).
Resting Membrane Conductance and Synaptic Potential Amplitude
The electrical circuit shown in Figure 11.9A can be simplified by representing the resting 
membrane as a single conductance, grest (equal to the sum of all the ionic conductances), 
and a single battery, Vrest (equal to the resting membrane potential). Likewise, the synaptic 
membrane can be represented by a single conductance, Δgs, and a battery whose voltage is 
equal to the reversal potential, Vr (Figure 11.9B). A feature of this electrical circuit is that 
the amplitude of a synaptic potential depends on both Δgs and grest. 
For simplicity, consider the steady-state membrane potential that would develop if the 
synaptic conductance were activated for a long period of time. If Δgs were much larger than 
grest, then the membrane potential would approach Vr. However, if Δgs were equal to grest,

then the change in membrane potential produced by activating the synaptic conductance 
would be only one-half as great. Thus, the amplitude of a synaptic potential can be increased 
by either increasing the synaptic conductance (i.e., activating more synaptic channels) or 
by decreasing the resting conductance. Indeed, a reduction in membrane conductance is 
an important mechanism for modulating synaptic strength. For example, certain inputs to 
autonomic ganglion cells in the bullfrog can close potassium channels, thereby increasing the 
amplitude of excitatory synaptic potentials produced by other inputs to the cell (see Chapter 
17). Similarly, an excitatory current of a given amplitude will give rise to a larger depolarization 
in a small neuron than in a large one that has a lower input resistance (see Chapter 7 and 24). 
Kinetics of Currents through Single ACh Receptor Channels
To what extent does the time course of the end-plate current reflect the behavior of indi-
vidual ACh channels? For example, do individual channels open and close repetitively during 
the end-plate current, with the probability of channel opening declining with time? Or do 
individual channels open only once, so that the time course of the current is determined 
by how long channels remain open? 
Definitive answers to such questions came only with the advent of patch clamp techniques, 
by which the behavior of individual channels could be observed directly (see Chapter 4).41
When ACh was applied continuously, ACh channels were shown to open instantaneously, 
in an all-or-nothing fashion, and then close at a rate that matched exactly the rate of decay 
of the end-plate current.42,43 These observations can be interpreted according to the fol-
lowing scheme for the interaction between the transmitter molecule A (for agonist) and 
the postsynaptic receptor molecule R (for receptor):

In this scheme, two ACh molecules sequentially combine with the channel (one on 
each α-subunit; see Chapter 5). With only one ACh molecule bound, the channel does not 
open (or opens very rarely). However, when the second ACh molecule binds, the channel

undergoes a very fast (microseconds) change in conformation from the closed (A2R) to 
the open (A2R*) state. The transitions between the open and closed states are characterized 
by the rate constants α and β, as indicated. Now consider the time course of the end-plate 
current, as illustrated in Figure 11.10. ACh arriving at the postsynaptic membrane opens 
a large number of channels almost simultaneously. Because ACh is lost rapidly from the 
synaptic cleft (through hydrolysis by the enzyme cholinesterase and by diffusion), each 
channel appears to open only once. As the channels close, the synaptic cur-
rent declines. Thus, the time course of decay of the end-plate current reflects 
the rate at which individual ACh channels close. Channels close at the rate α 
[A2R*]; that is, many channels close very quickly, and fewer and fewer channels 
close at longer and longer times. As with all independent or random events, 
the open times are distributed exponentially, and the mean open time (τ) is 
equal to the time constant of the decay of the end-plate current, 1/α.
With improved time resolution it was discovered that many of these apparent 
single channel openings were interrupted by one or more brief closures.44,45 In 
■  BOX 11.4 
Electrical Model of the Motor End Plate
How did A. and N. Takeuchi calculate the ratio of sodium to 
potassium conductance for the channels opened by ace-
tylcholine (ACh)? They proposed an electrical model of the 
muscle cell membrane similar to that shown in Figure 11.9A. 
Although ACh receptors do not form separate pathways for 
sodium and potassium, the two ions move through the chan-
nel independently. Therefore, the synaptic conductance and re-
versal potential can be represented by separate conductances 
(ΔgNa and ΔgK) and driving potentials (ENa and EK) for sodium 
and potassium. Accordingly, separate expressions can be writ-
ten for the sodium and potassium currents (ΔINa and ΔIK):
ΔINa = ΔgNa(Vm – ENa)
ΔIK = ΔgK(Vm – EK)
These equations provide a means of determining the rela-
tive conductance changes to sodium and potassium pro-
duced by ACh once the reversal potential (Vr) is determined. 
Since the Takeuchis considered only changes in current 
resulting from the action of ACh, they could ignore the rest-
ing membrane channels. The net synaptic current is zero at 
the reversal potential; therefore, at this potential the inward 
sodium current is exactly equal and opposite to the outward 
potassium current. So when Vm = Vr,
ΔgNa(Vr – ENa) = –ΔgK(Vr – EK)

Thus, the reversal potential is simply the average of the 
individual equilibrium potentials, weighted by the relative 
conductance changes. This relationship can be extended to 
include any number or variety of ions, so it is applicable at any 
synapse where transmitters produce a change in conduc-
tance of the postsynaptic membrane to one or more ions. 
This relationship was found to predict how changes in ENa and 
EK, produced by changes in extracellular concentrations of 
sodium and potassium, affected the reversal potential at the 
neuromuscular junction.30
Such predictions were accurate only for small changes in 
extracellular sodium and potassium, however, because chan-
nel conductance is determined in part by ion concentration 
(see Chapters 2 and 5). Therefore, the effect of a large change 
in sodium, potassium, or calcium concentration on reversal 
potential is predicted accurately only if the resulting change in 
conductance is taken into account. Alternatively, the analysis 
can be made in terms of permeabilities, using the constant 
field equation developed by Goldman, Hodgkin, and Katz (see 
Chapter 6).

other words, instead of just a single opening, the ACh-bound channel 
can give a short burst of two or more openings (Figure 11.11). This 
may be explained by supposing that, when the channel has reverted to 
the shut (A2R) state, instead of just going back to the mono-liganded 
shut state AR, it can flicker back and forth a few times to the open 
state A2R* before the second ACh molecule dissociates. The reason 
for this is that the conformational opening rate constant β is about 
the same as the dissociation rate constant k–2. This means that the 
original open channel lifetime (as depicted in Figure 11.11) is actually 
the mean burst length. The mean time-constant for decay of this burst 
(and hence for the end plate current decay) is given by τburst = 1/(a+k–2) – about double that 
for the closure of a single channel. It is worth noting that an ACh receptor channel open for 
a millisecond at –70 mV will conduct about 20,000 cations into the cell, i.e., 10,000 ions for 
each ACh molecule that binds to the receptor–an enormous signal amplification.
The properties of acetylcholine receptors change during development. There is a fetal 
form of the acetylcholine receptor, which has a low conductance and a long and variable 
open time, and an adult form, which has a higher conductance and shorter open time.46 The 
switch from embryonic to adult receptors is caused by a change in subunit composition (see 
Chapters 5 and 25), and splice variants of one of the embryonic subunits may account for 
variation in mean channel open time early in development.47 The change in properties is well 
adapted to the need for adequate current to stimulate the larger, fully developed muscle fibers.
Excitatory Synaptic Potentials in the CNS
The principles of synaptic excitation in the CNS follow those elucidated so beautifully at 
the neuromuscular junction: a pulse of transmitter released from the presynaptic bouton 
opens cation-selective channel receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. These receptors 
generate an inward excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) which, in turn depolarizes the 
postsynaptic membrane to produce an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP).
However, there are important differences between neuromuscular and CNS synapses. 
The first essential difference is that the principal excitatory transmitter is L-glutamate, 
not acetylcholine. Second, glutamate activates two different types of ionotropic glutamate 
receptor, the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, 
so-named after its selective agonist, and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor48,49
(Figure 11.12). Neither receptor is structurally homologous to the nicotinic receptor.50
Nevertheless, the AMPA receptor has similar permeability characteristics and serves the 
same function as the nicotinic receptor, which is to mediate fast transient excitatory 
transmission throughout the CNS. Thus, fast synaptic potentials evoked by glutamate 
can be reconstructed from the kinetics of AMPA-receptor channels,51 just as with end-
plate nicotinic channels. The NMDA glutamate receptor has several unique properties, 
however. First, at the normal resting potential it is tonically blocked by magnesium ions 
in the extracellular fluid,52,53 which means that, even when it is activated, no current 
flows until the cell is depolarized towards zero from the normal resting potential (see 
Figure 11.12). The reason is that the positive Mg2+ ions bind tightly in the channel when 
pulled into it by the normal transmembrane electrical gradient; however, this pull is 
reduced and the Mg2+ ions dissociate when the transmembrane gradient is reduced. The 
natural form of depolarization for unblocking the channel would be a train of preceding 
AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic potentials. This voltage-sensitivity also means that the 
NMDA receptor is not responsible for normal fast signaling between brain cells—only

the AMPA receptor does this. Second, the NMDA channels gate rather slowly,51 which 
means that they open more during high-frequency synaptic activity; then, once opened, 
they stay open longer than the AMPA receptors. Third, the NMDA receptors have an 
unusually high permeability to calcium ions54 and can thereby generate large increases 
in intracellular calcium concentration; this has a number of “second messenger” effects 
on neuronal function (see Chapter 12). All of these properties confer on the NMDA 
glutamate receptor a special role in synaptic development and plasticity (see Chapter 16).
In the CNS, the majority of excitatory synapses are located on the dendrites of the 
neurons. Synaptic potentials spread down the dendrites and through the soma to the normal 
site of action potential initiation at the axon hillock or axon initial segment (AIS).55 In 
almost all neurons, a single synaptic EPSP is far too small to initiate an action potential; to 
reach threshold, the individual EPSPs have to be summated and integrated in the soma/
dendritic region. In many neurons, such as the pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and 
cerebral cortex, and the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, the excitatory synapses are located 
on small projections from the dendrites termed dendritic spines56 (Figure 11.13). These 
spines play a special role in the long-term changes in brain function that accompany and 
follow synaptic activity (see Chapters 12 and 15).

Direct Synaptic Inhibition
The principles that underlie direct chemical synaptic excitation at the neuromuscular junc-
tion also apply to direct chemical inhibitory synapses. Whereas excitation occurs by opening 
channels in the postsynaptic membrane whose reversal potential is positive to threshold, 
direct chemical synaptic inhibition is achieved by opening channels whose reversal potential 
is negative to threshold. Direct chemical synaptic inhibition occurs by activating channels 
permeable to chloride—an anion that typically has an equilibrium potential at or near 
the resting potential. Pioneering studies of direct chemical synaptic inhibition were made 
on the crustacean neuromuscular junction,57,58 the crayfish stretch receptor,59 and spinal 
motoneurons of the cat, at which gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) and glycine are the 
principal transmitters.60
Reversal of Inhibitory Potentials
Spinal motoneurons are inhibited by sensory inputs from antagonistic muscles, by way 
of inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord. The effect of activation of inhibitory inputs 
can be studied by an experiment similar to that illustrated in Figure 11.14A. The moto-

neuron is impaled with two micropipettes—one to record potential changes, the other to 
pass current through the cell membrane. At the normal resting potential (about –75 mV), 
stimulation of the inhibitory inputs causes a slight hyperpolarization of the cell—the in-
hibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) (Figure 11.14B). When the membrane is depolarized 
by passing positive current into the cell, the amplitude of the IPSP is increased. When the 
cell is hyperpolarized to –82 mV, the inhibitory potential is very small and reversed in sign, 
and at –100 mV the reversed inhibitory potential is increased in amplitude. The reversal 
potential in this experiment is thus about –80 mV.
Inhibitory channels are permeable to anions, with permeabilities roughly correlated 
with the hydrated radius of the penetrating ion.61 In physiological circumstances, the only 
small anion present in any quantity is chloride. Thus, in spinal motoneurons injection of 
chloride into the cell from a micropipette shifts the chloride equilibrium potential, and 
hence the reversal potential for the inhibitory synaptic potential toward zero (i.e., in the 
positive direction). In other preparations, changes in extracellular chloride have been 
shown to produce corresponding changes in the chloride equilibrium potential and the 
IPSP reversal potential, but such experiments often give ambiguous results. This is because 
changes in extracellular chloride concentration lead eventually to proportionate changes in 
intracellular concentration as well (see Chapter 5), so any change in chloride equilibrium 
potential is only transient.
One way around this difficulty is to remove chloride entirely, as shown in Figure 11.15. 
The records are from a reticulospinal cell in the brainstem of the lamprey, in which inhibi-
tory synaptic transmission is mediated by glycine.62 Membrane potential was recorded with 
an intracellular microelectrode. A second electrode was used to pass brief hyperpolarizing 
current pulses into the cell; the resulting changes in potential provided a measure of the 
cell’s input resistance. Finally, a third micropipette was used to apply glycine to the cell 
close to an inhibitory synapse, using brief pressure pulses. Glycine application resulted in 
a slight hyperpolarization, with a marked reduction in input resistance (Figure 11.15A), 
as would be expected if glycine activated a large number of chloride channels. To test this 
idea, chloride was removed from the bathing solution and replaced by the impermeant ion 
isethionate. As a result, intracellular chloride was also removed by efflux, through chloride 
channels open at rest. After 20 minutes, glycine application produced no detectable change 
in membrane potential or input resistance (Figure 11.15B), indicating that no ions other 
than chloride pass through the inhibitory channels. The restoration of normal extracellular 
chloride concentration (Figure 11.15C) resulted in restoration of the response.

Given that the inhibitory response involves an increase in chloride permeability, the 
reversal potential for the inhibitory current will be equal to the chloride equilibrium 
potential (ECl) and the magnitude of the current will be given by:
Δiinhibitory = ΔiCl = ΔgCl(Vm – ECl)
At membrane potentials positive to ECl, the current is outward, resulting in membrane hy-
perpolarization. In this case outward current is carried by an influx of negatively charged 
chloride ions. At membrane potentials negative to ECl, inhibition causes an efflux of chlo-
ride ions, resulting in depolarization. 
Early in postnatal development of the mammalian central nervous system, GABA and 
glycine paradoxically depolarize and thereby excite neurons in the central nervous system.63
This effect is due not to differences in the properties of the channels opened by GABA and 
glycine, but to a difference in the nature of a transporter that regulates the intracellular chloride 
concentration64 (see Chapter 9). In embryonic neurons, chloride is transported into the neuron 
by a sodium–potassium–2-chloride cotransporter (NKCC), thereby generating a high intracel-
lular chloride concentration. Because ECl is positive to Vm, activation of chloride channels by 
GABA or glycine then results in outward movement of chloride and hence depolarization. At 
birth and during early postnatal development, another transporter, the potassium–chloride 
cotransporter (KCC2), becomes expressed. This extrudes chloride from the neuron. ECl then 
becomes negative to Em, so GABA or glycine will now hyperpolarize the cell. This chloride 
switch is important in brain development because GABA-releasing synapses develop earlier 
than glutamate-releasing synapses in the brain, so the ability of GABA to depolarize and excite 
embryonic neurons (and thereby to increase intracellular calcium) is thought to be crucial for 
the proper embryonic development of synapses and circuits.63 On the other hand, the postnatal 
switch from depolarization to hyperpolarization is essential for the normal function of inhibi-
tory circuits after birth. Thus, mice in which both genes for the outward chloride transporter 
KCC2 have been deleted (and so do not express any KCC2 protein) die shortly after birth 
because their normal central respiratory circuits do not work (see Chapter 23) so they cannot 
breathe.65 The chloride transporters are capable of maintaining different intracellular chloride 
concentrations in neuronal processes from those in the soma.66–68 However, in mammalian 
peripheral neurons and nerve fibers (which have GABA receptors but no GABAergic synapses), 
ECl is always depolarized to Em, even in adult animals.69,70 
Presynaptic Inhibition
So far we have defined excitatory and inhibitory synapses on the basis of the effect of the 
transmitter on the postsynaptic membrane—that is, based on whether the postsynaptic 
permeability change is to cations or to anions. However, a number of early experiments 
indicated that in some instances it was difficult to account for inhibition in terms of post-
synaptic permeability changes alone.71,72 The paradox was resolved by the discovery of an 
additional inhibitory mechanism, presynaptic inhibition,73 described in the mammalian 
spinal cord by Frank and Fuortes72 and by Eccles and his colleagues74 and at the crustacean 
neuromuscular junction by Dudel and Kuffler.75 Presynaptic inhibition results in a reduc-
tion in the amount of transmitter released from excitatory nerve terminals.76
As shown in Figure 11.16, the action of the inhibitory nerve at the crustacean neu-
romuscular junction is exerted not only on the muscle fibers, but also on the excitatory 
terminals. The presynaptic effect is brief, reaching a peak in a few milliseconds and declining 
to zero after a total of 6 to 7 ms. For the maximum inhibitory effect to occur, the impulse 
must arrive in the inhibitory presynaptic terminal several milliseconds before the action 
potential arrives in the excitatory terminal. The importance of accurate timing is shown 
in Figure 11.16, in which parts A and B show the excitatory and inhibitory potentials fol-
lowing separate stimulation of the corresponding nerves. In Figure 11.16C, both nerves are 
stimulated, but the action potential in the inhibitory nerve follows that in the excitatory 
nerve by 1.5 ms, arriving too late to exert any effect. In Figure 11.16D, on the other hand, 
the action potential in the inhibitory nerve precedes that in the excitatory nerve and now 
strongly reduces the excitatory postsynaptic potential. The presynaptic effect, like that on 
the postsynaptic membrane, is mediated by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and is associated 
with a marked increase in chloride permeability in the presynaptic terminals.77,78

In the nervous system in general, presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition serve 
quite different functions. Postsynaptic inhibition reduces the excitability of the entire 
cell, rendering it relatively less responsive to all excitatory inputs. Presynaptic inhibition 
is much more specific, aimed at a particular input and leaving the postsynaptic cell free 
to go about its business of integrating information from other sources.79 Presynaptic 
inhibition implies that inhibitory axons make synaptic contact with axon terminals. 
Such axo–axonic synapses have been demonstrated directly by electron microscopy at 
the crustacean neuromuscular junction80 and at numerous locations in the mammalian 
CNS.81 Moreover, inhibitory nerve terminals themselves can be influenced presynapti-
cally;82 the requisite ultrastructural arrangement has been reported at inhibitory synapses 
on crayfish stretch receptors.83 
Finally, there is an additional, quite different form of presynaptic inhibition in the 
mammalian nervous system that does not require the presence of specific presynaptic 
axo-axonal synapses, and can affect the release of transmitters from both excitatory and 
inhibitory terminals. This is due to the ability of transmitters (including glutamate84 and 
GABA) to spill over from the synaptic cleft, back onto the presynaptic terminals where they 
activate metabotropic (G protein–coupled) receptors. These receptors, in turn suppress 
calcium entry into the terminals, and thereby reduce transmitter release (see Chapter 
12). An example of this type of feedback inhibition (also called auto-inhibition) at a 
GABA-releasing synapse in the hippocampus is shown in Figure 11.17. Here, the authors85
recorded the monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic currents from a hippocampal CA1 
pyramidal neuron produced by GABA and released by stimulating fibers in the nearby 
stratum radiatum. A second stimulus, given 100 ms after the first, produced a much 
smaller current (a phenomenon called paired-pulse depression). (Figure 11.17A) This 
depression was due to the spread of the released GABA to the presynaptic terminals, where 
it activated the metabotropic GABAB receptor and so reduced the amount of transmitter 
released by the second stimulus, as shown schematically in Figure 11.17B. The paired-pulse 
depression was much reduced when the GABAB receptors were selectively blocked with 
the compound 2-hydroxy-saclofen or by CGP 35348. Presynaptic inhibition mediated 
by metabotropic receptors is slower in onset but lasts much longer than that mediated 
by ionotropic receptors (previously shown in Figure 11.16). It needs a minimal interval 
between the two stimuli of 20 to 30 ms to take effect, is maximal at around 100 ms, and 
lasts up to a second or more. The delayed onset reflects the time it takes for the receptor 
to activate a G protein and inhibit the calcium channels, while the slow offset is due to 
the slow kinetics of G protein recovery (see Chapter 12).

Transmitter Receptor Localization
Figures 11.6 and 11.7 show that the acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are highly concentrated 
at the motor end plate. This is because they are aggregated into a specialized postsynaptic 
apparatus formed by cytoskeletal, membrane, and membrane-associated proteins (Figure 
11.18).86,87 At the mammalian neuromuscular junction the acetylcholine receptors are 
retained in the postsynaptic complex for several days (half-time 4.7 days);88 by contrast, 
the residence half-time of the extrasynaptic receptors is about a day, which is similar to 
the turnover time of most membrane proteins. Within the postsynaptic apparatus, a 43 
kilodaltons (kD) AChR-associated protein, called rapsyn, and components of the dystro-
phin complex play a key role in AChR localization. The dystrophin complex, which links 
together the myofiber cytoskeleton, membrane, and surrounding extracellular matrix, 
also provides structural support for the muscle cell.89 Mutations in components of this 
complex give rise to Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, in which muscle fibers are damaged 
and degenerate.90 The dystrophin complex is also involved in the maintenance of some 
other synapses in the central nervous system, and in the localization of aquaporin water 
channels, so its disruption can cause a variety of nervous system disorders.91 When a mo-
tor nerve is cut and allowed to degenerate (see Chapter 26), the ACh receptor clustering 
mechanism at the end plate is disrupted such that the receptor lifetime is shortened.92 At 
the same time, the number of extrajunctional receptors increases, causing denervation 
supersensitivity,93 and their subunit composition reverts to the embryonic type as a result 
of a change in transcription.94
The postsynaptic apparatus at excitatory synapses in the central nervous system is 
also a very complex structure, containing more than 200 proteins as determined by mass 
spectrometry.95,96 Three families of these proteins interact with glutamate receptors in the 
postsynaptic density (Figure 11.19).97 Proteins in each of the families have one or more PDZ 
domains, which are conserved regions that mediate protein–protein interactions. PDZ is

evoked by the second stimulus is much smaller than that produced by the first 
stimulus (paired pulse depression). This depression was largely due to activa-

and out of the PSD (as is necessary for the rapid changes required for synaptic plasticity, 
see Chapter 16). More importantly, they create an intracellular scaffold to recruit important 
signaling proteins that modify glutamate receptor function, dendritic architecture, and 
gene transcription downstream of receptor activation. These signaling proteins include 
nitric oxide synthase, calmodulin (CaM) kinase II, receptor tyrosine kinases, a guanosine 
triphosphate (GTP)ase-activating protein for small synaptic Ras GTPases (SynGAP), and 
inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors, and Ras-like small GTPases. Thus, these proteins 
determine not only receptor location, but also the consequences of receptor activation.
Localization of glycine and GABA receptors at inhibitory synapses in the central nervous 
system also requires ancillary subsynaptic proteins.98,99 Postsynaptic clustering of glycine 
receptors requires the 93 kD subsynaptic protein gephyrin, which binds to the receptors 
and connects them to tubulin in the microtubules.100,101 Thus, clustering is prevented when 
gephyrin synthesis is inhibited with an antisense nucleotide.102 Gephyrin also is essential 
for localization of some GABAA receptors in postsynaptic membranes, although direct 
interactions between gephyrin and GABAA receptor subunits have not been demonstrated.100
Gephyrin interacts with several intracellular components that mediate responses to activity 
and trophic factors.98 Such interactions are thought to play a central role in the assembly 
and stabilization of postsynaptic specializations at inhibitory synapses.
Electrical Synaptic Transmission
Identification and Characterization of Electrical Synapses
In addition to the chemical transmission seen at most vertebrate synapses, there are places 
where true electrical transmission does occur. These places are either at synapses on reflex 
pathways where a particularly fast response is necessary or (in the retina and the CNS) where 
electrical transmission assists in coordinating or amplifying the activity of groups of neurons. 
An example of a fast electrical synapse was provided in 1959 by Furshpan and Potter. 
Using intracellular microelectrodes to record from nerve fibers in the abdominal nerve 
cord of the crayfish, they discovered an electrical synapse between neurons that mediated 
the animal’s escape reflex (Figure 11.20A).8 They demonstrated that an action potential 
in a lateral giant fiber led (by direct intercellular current flow) to depolarization of a giant 
motor fiber leaving the cord (Figure 11.20B). The depolarization was sufficient to initiate 
an action potential in the postsynaptic fiber. The electrical coupling was in one direction 
only; depolarization of the postsynaptic fiber did not lead to presynaptic depolarization 
(Figure 11.20C). In other words, the synapse rectified. 
Unlike the crayfish giant synapse, most electrical synapses do not exhibit rectification, 
but conduct equally well in both directions. The morphological specialization for electrical 
coupling at the crayfish giant synapse and other electrical synapses is the gap junction.103,104
(see Chapter 8).  Most gap junctions are formed by an assembly of connexons, each composed 
of six transmembrane connexin molecules105,106 (or, in invertebrates, non-homologous but 
structurally similar innexon molecules107). The connexons (or innexons) in the membranes 
of the two connected neurons line up to form a conducting pathway that allow current 
to pass from one cell to the next. Rectification probably results from the contributions of 
different connexins or innexons to the pre- and postsynaptic connexons.108 In the leech, 
electrical coupling between pairs of touch sensory neurons has the remarkable property that 
depolarization spreads readily from either cell to the other, but hyperpolarization spreads 
poorly; that is, the electrical connections are doubly rectifying.109,110 This may result from 
the functional contribution of a rectifying innexon (hm-inx2) to a heteromeric assembly of 
innexin molecules in both pre- and postsynaptic membranes.111 
Many connexins (especially connexin-36, Cx36) are strongly expressed in the vertebrate 
central nervous system,104,112 and electrical transmission has now been demonstrated at 
a wide variety of central synapses.113,114 Electrical connections are particularly prominent 
between inhibitory GABA-releasing interneurons in the hippocampus,113 cerebral cortex,115
and cerebellum.116 In the rat somatosensory cortex, a single interneuron may be electri-
cally coupled with up to 10 other interneurons at distances up to 200 μm away, forming 
mini-networks of 10 to 40 neurons.117 Their effect is to synchronize interneuronal activity 
and contribute to some of the synchronized oscillations of electrical activity that can be

recorded in these parts of the brain.118 There is also a particularly rich network of electrical 
synapses in the retina.119 The functions of these retinal electrical synapses are diverse. For 
example, those between horizontal cells greatly extend the cell’s receptive field and enhance 
the signal/noise ratio for light detection under low-light conditions; while those between 
amacrine cells and rods are necessary for rod input to ON bipolar cells (see Chapter 20). 
The degree of electrical coupling between cells is usually expressed as a coupling ratio. A 
ratio of 1:4 means that one-fourth of the presynaptic voltage change appears in the postsynaptic 
cell. For cells to be strongly coupled, the resistance of the junction between the cells must 
be very low and there must be a reasonable match between the sizes of the presynaptic and 
postsynaptic elements (see Chapter 7). Efficient coupling depends not only on the number 
of coupled connexons but also on their individual conductances. Thus, the channels can be 
closed by an increase in intracellular calcium, and their conductance is reduced when they are 
phosphorylated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase. This 
means that electrical connectivity mediated by gap junctions can be altered by neurotrans-
mitters that affect intracellular calcium or cAMP (see Chapter 12). This occurs in the retina, 
where light stimulates the release of dopamine from amacrine cells. This increases cAMP in 
horizontal cells, which in turn activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Through the action 
of the enzyme, the gap junction connexin becomes phosphorylated, resulting in a decrease 
in its conductance. As a result the receptive field of the horizontal cell shrinks. Conversely, 
reduced dopamine release at night has the opposite effect of increasing the horizontal cell’s 
receptive field and enhancing the detection of dim objects.119
Comparison of Electrical and Chemical Transmission 
Electrical and chemical transmission often coexist at a single synapse. Such combined electrical 
and chemical synapses were first found in cells of the avian ciliary ganglion, where a chemical

synaptic potential (produced by ACh) is preceded by an electrical coupling poten-
tial (Figure 11.21).9 Similar synapses occur widely in vertebrates—for example, 
onto spinal interneurons of the lamprey,120 spinal motoneurons of the frog, and 
inhibitory cells in the cerebral cortex.121 Postsynaptic cells may also receive sepa-
rate chemical and electrical synaptic inputs from different sources. For example, 
in leech ganglia (see Chapter 18), motor neurons receive three distinct types of 
synaptic input from sensory neurons signaling three different modalities: one 
input is chemical, one electrical, and one combined electrical and chemical.122
One characteristic of electrically mediated synaptic transmission is the absence 
of a synaptic delay. At chemical synapses, there is a pause of approximately 1 ms 
between the arrival of an impulse in the presynaptic terminal and the appearance 
of an electrical potential in the postsynaptic cell. The delay is due to the time taken 
for the terminal to release transmitter (see Chapter 13). At electrical synapses, there 
is no such delay, and current spreads instantaneously from one cell to the next.
The presence of both electrical and chemical transmission at the same synapse 
provides a convenient means of comparing the two modes of transmission. This 
is illustrated in Figure 11.21, which shows intracellular records from a cell in 
the ciliary ganglion of the chick. Stimulation of the preganglionic nerve leads 
to an action potential in the postsynaptic cell, with very short latency (Figure 
11.21A). When the cell is hyperpolarized slightly (Figure 11.21B), the action 
potential arises at a later time, revealing an early, brief depolarization that is now 
subthreshold because the cell has been hyperpolarized. This depolarization is 
an electrical coupling potential, produced by current flow from the presynaptic 
nerve terminal into the cell. Further hyperpolarization (Figure 11.21C) blocks 
the initiation of the action potential altogether, revealing the underlying chemical synaptic 
potential. These cells then have the property that, under normal conditions, initiation of a 
postsynaptic action potential by chemical transmission is preempted by electrical coupling. 
In this example the coupling potential precedes the chemical synaptic potential by about 2 
ms, giving us a direct measure of the synaptic delay. Additional experiments on these cells 
have shown that the electrical coupling is bidirectional; that is, the synapses do not rectify.
There are several advantages to electrical transmission. One is that electrical synapses 
are more reliable than chemical synapses; transmission is less likely to fail because of syn-
aptic depression or to be blocked by neurotoxins. A second advantage is the greater speed 
of electrical transmission. Speed is important in rapid reflexes involving escape reactions, 
in which the saving of a millisecond may be crucial for surviving an attack by a predator. 
Other functions include the synchronization of electrical activity of groups of cells112, 113 and 
intercellular transfer of key molecules, such as calcium, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and 
cAMP.103 Connexins have quite wide pores (12–14 Å),105 which allow large molecules up to 
1 kD to pass through. These include dyes such as Lucifer yellow and neurobiocytin, that can 
be used to visualize electrical coupling between neurons.103,104, 116 In the brain and retina, 
they are especially abundant during embryonic and early postnatal development and may 
play an important role in generating the rhythmic electrical activity necessary for neural 
development.123 Finally, they are subject to biochemical and neurotransmitter regulation, 
in the retina (as previously noted) and elsewhere.124,125 Thus, gap junctions do not func-
tion merely as passive connections but can be dynamic components of neuronal circuits.

SUMMARY
 
■
Signaling between nerve cells and their targets can 
occur by chemical or electrical synaptic transmission. 
Most synapses use chemical transmission.
 
■
At chemical synapses a neurotransmitter released 
from the presynaptic terminal activates receptors in 
the postsynaptic membrane. The time required for 
transmitter release imposes a minimum synaptic delay 
of approximately 1 ms.
 
■
Direct chemical synaptic transmission occurs when the 
postsynaptic receptor activated by a neurotransmitter 
is itself an ion channel. Such ligand-activated ion 
channels are called ionotropic transmitter receptors.
 
■
At direct excitatory synapses, such as the vertebrate 
skeletal neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter 
(in this case acetylcholine) opens cation-selective 
channels, allowing sodium, potassium, and calcium 
ions to flow down their electrochemical gradients.
 
■
The relative permeability of a channel for various 
ions determines the reversal potential. At excitatory 
synapses, the reversal potential is more depolarized 
than the threshold for action potential initiation.
 
■
Direct chemical synaptic inhibition occurs when a 
neurotransmitter opens anion-selective channels, which 
allow chloride ions to flow down their electrochemical 
gradient. The reversal potential for such currents is the 
chloride equilibrium potential (ECl); inhibition occurs if 
ECl is hyperpolarized to threshold. 
 
■
The intracellular chloride concentration is set by inward 
or outward chloride pumps. During early development 
the pump is inward so the channels opened by the 
inhibitory transmitter allow an outward flow of chloride 
ions, producing a depolarization.
 
■
Receptors for inhibitory transmitters may also be 
present on presynaptic terminals, where their activation 
reduces transmitter release. 
 
■
Receptors for excitatory and inhibitory transmitters are 
aggregated into specialized regions of the postsynaptic 
membrane by an array of scaffolding proteins. 
 
■
Electrical synaptic transmission is mediated by the 
direct flow of current from cell to cell, through ion 
channels called connexons that span the synaptic 
cleft. Electrical transmission is very rapid and used at 
specialized synapses mediating very fast reflexes. It 
is also used in the retina and brain to coordinate the 
activity of groups of neurons.

■ CHAPTER 12
Indirect Mechanisms of 
Synaptic Transmission
I
n addition to opening ion channels, neurotransmitters bind to other membrane receptors, 
known as metabotropic receptors. Metabotropic receptors influence ion channels indirectly 
through membrane-associated or cytoplasmic second messengers. At many synapses in the 
central and autonomic nervous systems, excitatory and inhibitory transmission occurs solely by 
these indirect mechanisms. At other locations, indirect mechanisms serve to modulate direct 
transmission.
Most metabotropic receptors (G protein–coupled receptors) produce their effects by first inter-
acting with G proteins in the cell membrane. G proteins, so called because they bind guanine nu-
cleotides, are trimers of three subunits: α, β, and γ. When a G protein is activated by its receptor, 
the α- and βγ-subunits dissociate. The free subunits can diffuse, and then bind to and modulate 
the activity of intracellular targets. Some G protein subunits bind to ion channels, producing rela-
tively brief effects. For example, when acetylcholine (ACh) binds to its muscarinic receptors in the 
heart atrium, a G protein is activated and the freed βγ-subunit then opens a potassium channel, 
thereby slowing the heart. A second mechanism of G protein action is through activation of en-
zymes that produce intracellular second messengers. An example is the activation of β-adrenergic 
receptors in the heart by norepinephrine. The α-subunit of the dissociated G protein stimulates the 
enzyme, adenylyl cyclase. The resulting increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
(AMP), or cAMP, activates another enzyme, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which modifies the 
activity of channels and enzymes through phosphorylation. Such responses may last for seconds, 
minutes, or hours—often persisting long after the transmitter interaction with the receptors has 
stopped. These mechanisms provide both amplification and radiation of signals.
Potassium and calcium channels are prime targets for such indirect transmitter action. Indirect 
action can cause channels to be opened, closed, or changed in their voltage sensitivity. Thus, 
indirectly acting transmitters open potassium channels in heart atrial cells; inhibit N-type calcium 
channels and M-type potassium channels in sympathetic neurons; and increase the probability 
that calcium channels will open in response to depolarization in cardiac muscle cells. Changes in 
channel activation in axon terminals modify transmitter release. In postsynaptic cells, such chang-
es alter spontaneous activity and the responses to synaptic inputs.
In addition, there are tertiary messengers, which are generated by some forms of synaptic 
activation. These include endocannabinoids (lipid messengers) and a gas, nitric oxide (NO). These 
molecules diffuse freely and so have effects outside the synapse or cell in which they are made. 
Calcium ions constitute another tertiary messenger and produce both short-term and long-term 
changes in neuron excitability and synaptic function. The long-term changes include effects on 
gene transcription and synaptic wiring.

214 Chapter 12
Direct Versus Indirect Transmission
In Chapter 11, we described the process of direct chemical transmission. In this process, 
a neurotransmitter released from a presynaptic ending binds to and within a millisecond, 
opens ion channels (ionotropic receptors) in the postsynaptic membrane (Figure 12.1A). 
Thus, direct transmission is extremely fast and is required for high-speed, integrated mo-
tor performance, such as playing a trill on the piano or for discriminating different notes 
at frequencies up to several kilohertz.
However, many of the essential human functions require a more gradual and longer-
lasting form of communication. For example, when we are excited or frightened, the 
sympathetic nervous system is stimulated (see Chapter 17) and as a result, the heart rate 
gradually increases over many seconds. This action does not require ultra-fast transmission 
from the sympathetic nerves to the heart but instead requires a rather careful adjustment 
to the endogenous cardiac rhythm. This form of slow modulatory transmission is also an 
essential component of synaptic activity in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is 
superimposed on the faster type of transmission mediated by the ionotropic receptors. 
There it serves to adjust the efficiency of synaptic transmission, and the excitability of the 
neuron, over seconds or minutes (or even longer).
Slow modulatory transmission uses a completely different type of membrane receptor 
from the ionotropic receptor responsible for fast transmission. Slow transmission uses a 
so-called metabotropic receptor. These receptors are not ion channels and do not directly 
excite or inhibit a neuron. Instead, they interact with other membrane proteins to initiate 
a sequence of steps leading to a change in ion channel activity or other metabolic processes 
within the neuron (Figure 12.1B). For this reason, this form of transmission is referred to 
as indirect transmission. For the vast majority of metabotropic receptors, the first target

protein with which they interact is another membrane protein, called a G protein; hence, 
metabotropic receptors of this type are termed G protein–coupled receptors (or GPCRs 
for short).
In the rest of this chapter we describe G proteins and G protein–coupled receptors, give 
examples of how they modify ion channels, both directly and indirectly, through subsequent 
enzymatic cascades; and describe some effects of other downstream messengers of receptor 
activation, such as NO, endocannabinoids, and calcium ions.
G Protein–Coupled Metabotropic Receptors and G Proteins
Structure of G Protein–Coupled Receptors
GPCRs make up a superfamily of membrane proteins characterized by seven trans-
membrane domains, with an extracellular amino terminus and an intracellular carboxy 
terminus (Figure 12.2).1–3 For this reason, they are sometimes called 7-transmembrane 
(7TM) or heptahelical receptors. More than a thousand different GPCRs have been identi-
fied (Box 12.1). Those activated by ACh are called muscarinic receptors; those that bind 
norepinephrine are known as adrenergic receptors. Others respond to γ-aminobutyric 
acid (GABA), serotonin (5-HT), dopamine, glutamate, purines, or neuropeptides; and 
some are activated by light (rhodopsin; see Chapter 20), by odorants (see Chapter 19), 
or by proteases.
Biochemical, structural, and molecular genetic experiments have indicated several distinct 
modes of ligand binding, each of which ultimately produces a similar rearrangement of 
the α-helical regions that form the transmembrane core of the receptor (see Figure 12.2). 
Portions of the second and third cytoplasmic loops, together with the membrane proximal 
region of the carboxy tail, mediate binding to and activation of the appropriate G protein.1,3

mediate binding to the appropriate G protein. Phosphorylation of sites 
on the third cytoplasm loop and the carboxy terminus by second-
messenger–related kinases, such as cAMP-dependent protein 
kinase, causes receptor desensitization. Phosphorylation of sites on 
the carboxy terminus by G protein receptor kinases (GRKs), such as 
β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK), causes receptor 
desensitization, binding of the protein arrestin, and termination of 
the response. (B) Portions of the transmembrane domains form the

216 Chapter 12
G Proteins
G proteins link the GPCR to its immediate effector protein. They are membrane proteins, 
so-named because they bind guanine nucleotides. Each G protein is a trimer made up of 
three subunits: α, β, and γ (Figure 12.3).3 There are many isoforms of each G protein subunit 
(21 for α, 6 for β, 12 for γ), providing a large number of potential trimer permutations. G 
proteins are grouped into three main classes according to the structure and targets of their 
α-subunits: Gs stimulates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase; Gi inhibits adenylyl cyclase (and also 
activates potassium channels); and Gq couples to the enzyme phospholipase C (PLC). The Gi
class also includes Gt (transducin), which activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
phosphodiesterase (see Chapter 19), and Go, which interacts with calcium ion channels.
The prime binding site for the receptor is the C-terminus of the α-subunit, and the main 
determinant that specifies which G protein a receptor activates is the amino acid sequence 
of this C-terminus (although interactions with other subunits may facilitate binding). This 
sequence differs among the different classes of G protein (Gs, Gq and Gi/o) but is identical 
or very similar among different members of each class. Hence, while some receptors are 
promiscuous and can couple to more than one class of G proteins, most metabotropic 
neurotransmitter receptors show a preferential interaction with one or other of the three 
common classes of G protein, as shown in Box 12.1.
THE G PROTEIN CYCLE The way in which the G protein works is illustrated in Figure 
12.3. In the resting state, guanosine diphosphate (GDP) is bound to the α-subunit, and

Receptors, G Proteins, and Effectors: Convergence and Divergence in G Protein Signaling
There are more than 200 different 
metabotropic receptors that can cou-
ple to G proteins but a much smaller 
number of different G proteins. The 
primary receptor interaction site on 
the G protein is the C-terminus of the 
α-subunit. Hence, as viewed by the 
receptor, there are only three families 
of common G proteins: Gs, Gq and 
Gi/Go. Although each family contains 
several members, their C-terminal 
sequences cannot be distinguished 
by the receptor. This means that there 
is substantial convergence of differ-
ent transmitters or hormones, acting 
through different receptors, onto the 
same G protein. On the output side, 
while some G proteins have rather 
specific effects (e.g., Go selectively 
interacts with certain types of neuronal 
calcium channels), others—particu-
larly those that activate enzymes to 
produce second messengers, such 
as cyclic AMP—can produce multiple 
effects on any given cell, providing 
divergent signaling. Gs, Gq, and Gi 
are present in nearly all cells, and Go 
is abundant in all nerve cells. In most 
cells, G protein molecules are about 10 times more plentiful 
than receptor molecules, so different receptors do not neces-
sarily compete for the same G protein molecules. Possible 
ways in which selectivity of a cell’s response to different trans-
mitters acting on the same G protein may occur are discussed 
in the text.

the three subunits are associated as a trimer. Interaction with an activated receptor allows 
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to replace GDP on the α-subunit, resulting in dissociation 
of the α- and βγ-subunits. (The β- and γ-subunits remain together under physiological 
conditions.) Free α- and βγ-subunits then diffuse, bind to and modulate the activity of target 
proteins.3–5 The free α-subunit has intrinsic GTPase activity that results in the hydrolysis 
of the bound GTP to GDP. This permits the re-association of the α- and βγ-subunits into 
the G protein complex and terminates their activity.
The lifetime of the activated G protein subunits is modulated by proteins called 
GTPase-activating proteins, or GAPs, which influence the rate at which GTP, bound to 
the α-subunit, is hydrolyzed.6 One family of GAPs, the RGS proteins—Regulators of G 
protein Signaling—play an important role in determining the time course of transmitter 
action.7 The details of the interactions of the G protein subunits with each other and with 
their receptors and targets have been explored using biomolecular X-ray crystallography1,3
and live-cell imaging8,9 techniques. In addition, probes have been developed for identifying 
responses mediated by G proteins (Box 12.2).
Modulation of Ion Channel Function by 
Receptor-Activated G Proteins: Direct Actions
G proteins affect ion channels in two different ways. First, a subunit of the activated G 
protein (usually the βγ-complex) may interact directly with the ion channel; or, second, 
the G protein (usually the GTP-bound α-subunit) may activate one or more enzymes to 
alter ion channel function indirectly through one or more second messengers.
G Protein Activation of Potassium Channels
Much of our knowledge about the direct interaction of G proteins with ion channels comes 
from experiments concerning the way in which stimulation of the vagus nerve slows or 
stops the heart beat. As first shown by Loewi (see Box 11.1), this is due to the release of ACh 
from the vagus nerve endings. The ACh then binds to a G protein–coupled receptor—the 
M2 muscarinic receptor (see Box 12.1)—so-called because it is selectively activated by the 
drug muscarine,10 an alkaloid in the fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) mushroom. Figure 12.4 
illustrates what happens when ACh is applied to the sinoatrial node of the rabbit heart. In 
Figure 12.4A a brief application of ACh causes a temporary cessation of spontaneous ac-
tion potentials and a hyperpolarization of the heart muscle cell (as first shown by Burgen 
and Terroux11 and Hutter and Trautwein12). This hyperpolarization is due to the opening 
of potassium channels,13 generating the outward potassium current seen in Figure 12.4B.
The role of G proteins in coupling the muscarinic receptors to these ion channels was 
established in a series of experiments by Breitwieser, Szabo, Pfaffinger, Trautwein, Hille, 
and their colleagues. They found that intracellular GTP is required;14 that activation of 
potassium channels by muscarinic agonists is greatly prolonged by intracellular application

G Proteins. G proteins are trimers of 
α-, β-, and γ-subunits. Activation of a 
metabotropic receptor by agonist bind-
ing (indicated by a star) promotes the 
exchange of guanosine triphosphate 
(GTP) for guanosine diphosphate (GDP) 
on the α-subunit of the G protein. This 
action activates the α-subunit and the 
βγ-complex, causing them to dissociate 
from the receptor and from one another. 
The free activated α-GTP subunit and 
βγ-complex each interacts with target 
proteins. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and 
inorganic phosphate (Pi) by the endog-
enous GTPase activity of the α-subunit 
leads to re-association of the αβγ-
complex, terminating the response.

Identifying Responses Mediated by G Proteins
Several tests can be used to identify responses mediated by G 
proteins. For example, activation of the α-subunit requires that 
bound GDP be replaced by GTP. Accordingly, G protein medi-
ated events have an absolute requirement for cytoplasmic GTP 
and will be blocked by intracellular perfusion with solutions lack-
ing GTP. Two analogues of GTP—GTPγS and Gpp(NH)p—are 
useful because they cannot be hydrolyzed by the endogenous 
GTPase activity of the α-subunit. Like GTP, they can replace 
GDP on the α-subunit and activate it. However, because they 
cannot be hydrolyzed, these analogues activate the α-subunit 
permanently. Thus, intracellular perfusion with either of these 
analogues enhances and greatly prolongs agonist-induced 
activation of G protein mediated responses and may even initi-
ate responses in the absence of agonist. On the other hand, 
GDPβS, an analogue of GDP, binds strongly to the GDP site on 
the α-subunit and resists replacement by GTP. Thus, GDPβS 
inhibits G protein mediated responses by maintaining the αβγ-
complex in the inactive state.
Two bacterial toxins are useful for characterizing G protein 
mediated processes. Each is an enzyme that catalyzes the 
covalent attachment of ADP-ribose to an arginine residue on 
the α-subunit. Cholera toxin acts on αs, irreversibly activating 
it; pertussis toxin acts on members of the αi family, irreversibly 
blocking their activation and so inhibiting responses mediated 
by the corresponding G proteins.

of the non-hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, known as Gpp(NH)p;15 and that muscarinic 
activation of potassium channels is blocked by pertussis toxin,14 which inactivates Gi proteins 
(see Box 12.2). An important advance came from experiments by David Clapham and his 
colleagues using inside-out excised membrane patches (Figure 12.5). They showed that the 
cardiac potassium channels were opened when pure recombinant βγ-subunit was applied to 
the intracellular side of the patch.16 This demonstrated that the βγ-subunit, rather than the 
α-subunit, is responsible for potassium channel activation. Subsequent experiments with 
a cloned muscarinic potassium channel (originally named GIRK1, for G protein activated 
inward rectifier K+ channel, but later renamed Kir3.1) indicated that βγ-subunits interact 
directly with potassium channels (Figure 12.5B).17,18
Using muscle cells dissociated from the atrium of the heart, Soejima and Noma found 
that potassium channel activity in cell-attached patches was increased when muscarinic 
agonists were added to the patch pipette solution, but not when agonists were added to 
the bath (Figure 12.6).19 Thus, activated βγ-subunits appear unable to traverse the region 
of the pipette–membrane seal to influence channels on the other side. This so-called 
membrane-delimited mechanism of G protein action reflects the limited range over which 
βγ-subunits can act. In fact, some evidence suggests that the G protein, GTPase-activating 
protein RGS4,20 and GIRK channel are closely associated and may then form a receptor, 
the G protein–GIRK channel complex.9,21
Similar G protein activated inward rectifier potassium channels (GIRK channels)22
are also present in many nerve cells. There, they can be activated by a number of dif-
ferent neurotransmitters through receptors coupled to Gi/Go proteins—for example, 
ACh, norepinephrine, GABA, and dopamine.23 Their activation induces a postsynaptic 
hyperpolarization (inhibitory synaptic potential) very similar to the cardiac response to 
vagal stimulation. Figure 12.7 shows an example from an experiment on bullfrog ganglion 
cells.24 When the nicotinic receptors in the ganglion had been blocked with curare, a few 
electrical stimuli, applied to the preganglionic sympathetic nerves in the descending lum-

bar sympathetic chain, generated a hyperpolarization of the small neurons in the lumbar 
sympathetic ganglia. The hyperpolarization was closely replicated by local ionophoresis of 
ACh onto the neurons (Figure 12.7B). Further tests showed that both the inhibitory synaptic 
potential and response to ACh reversed when the cell was hyperpolarized beyond –102 mV 
in normal Ringer solution (containing 2 millimolar [mM] K+). They also found that this 
reversal potential shifted 58 mV per tenfold increase in extracellular [K+], showing that it 
was due to an increased K+ conductance. When the cell was induced to fire repetitively, a 
short (1 second) burst of preganglionic stimulation reversibly suppressed firing (Figure 
12.7C)—very much like the response of cardiac sinoatrial cells to vagal stimulation. Indeed, 
the molecular mechanism for this action on ganglion cells is analogous to that in the heart.25

G Protein Inhibition of Calcium Channels 
Involved in Transmitter Release
When released, many neurotransmitters (including ACh, glutamate, 
GABA, mono-amines such as norepinephrine, and many peptides) not 
only stimulate postsynaptic receptors but also activate metabotropic 
receptors on the presynaptic terminals to reduce their own release (see 
Chapter 11). An example of this feedback inhibition (or autoinhibition) 
of the release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals in frog sympa-
thetic ganglia26 is illustrated in Figure 12.8. As shown schematically 
in Figure 12.8A, the transmitter acts not only on postsynaptic target 
cells, but also on the nerve terminals themselves. Figure 12.8B shows 
the release of radioactively tagged norepinephrine from the terminals 
in response to depolarization by elevated external potassium (green 
bar). Addition of norepinephrine to the bathing solution (red bar) 
produced a marked reduction of transmitter release from the terminals.
This decrease in release is due to activation of presynaptic metabo-
tropic α2-adrenergic receptors (see Box 12.1). These activate Go proteins, 
which in turn directly inhibit activation of N-type (CaV2.2) calcium 
channels (see Chapter 5). This effect is shown in the records of Figure 12.9. Single-channel 
calcium currents from a cell-attached patch, produced by membrane depolarization, are 
reduced in frequency when norepinephrine is added to the patch solution. As with the effect 
of ACh on potassium channels (see Figure 12.6), there was no response of the channels to 
the application of norepinephrine outside the patch (the response is membrane-delimited), 
suggesting again a close association between the G proteins and the channels.
Results of experiments in which α- or βγ-subunits or βγ-sequestering peptides were over-
expressed or injected into cells indicated that it is the βγ-subunits that inhibit N-type calcium 
channels.27–29 This is illustrated in Figure 12.10A. The inward calcium current produced by 
depolarizing a sympathetic ganglion cell (a), was reduced strongly by adding norepinephrine 
(NE) to the bathing solution. A similar effect was observed when a non-hydrolysable GTP 
analog was added to the bath (b) or when βγ-subunits were over-expressed in the cell by 
prior injection of their cDNAs (c). The βγ-subunits bind directly to the calcium channel 
α-subunit, primarily at the intracellular linker between domains I and II30 (see Figure 5.3B).

(B) Norepinephrine reduces the release of transmitter from sympathetic gan-
glia. Ganglia were loaded with radioactive norepinephrine and then enclosed 
in a perfusion chamber. Transmitter release was evoked by depolarization with 
a solution containing 50 mM potassium (green bars). Addition of 30 μM unla-
beled norepinephrine to the perfusion solution (red bar) reduced the amount 
of radiolabeled transmitter released in response to potassium-induced depo-
larization. (B after Lipscombe, Kongsamut, and Tsien, 1989.)

This interaction is voltage-dependent, with inhibition being reduced by depolarization; 
hence, inhibition diminishes as the depolarizing pulse is maintained.31,32 In Figure 12.10A, 
this voltage-dependence appears as a slowing of the calcium current; this suggests that the 
channels have been converted from their normal “willing to open” state to a “reluctant 
to open” state.33 The voltage-dependence is shown in another way in Figure 12.10B, by 
delivering a very large depolarization for 50 ms between two calcium current test pulses. 
This accelerates the dissociation of the G protein βγ-subunit so that the inhibition pro-
duced by norepinephrine (a) or by the expressed βγ-subunits (b), seen during the first 
test pulse, is completely reversed when the second test pulse is given. On repolarization, 
channel inhibition is restored quite quickly, over 100 ms or so (not shown), as the released 
Gβγ-subunits re-associate with the channel, suggesting that they have not moved far away. 
It has been calculated that the receptor, G protein, and channel must all be within less 
than 1 μm distance.34 Recent experiments have shown that the primary response of the G 
protein–coupled receptor to a transmitter is also sensitive to membrane voltage35,36 and 
that this property may also modify their effect on neurotransmitter release.37
G Protein Activation of Cytoplasmic 
Second Messenger Systems
Many G proteins do not bind directly to ion channels. Instead they modulate the activity of 
enzymes involved in cytoplasmic second messenger systems: adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase 
C, phospholipase A2, phosphodiesterase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The products 
of these enzymes, in turn, affect targets that influence the activity of ion channels and other 
cellular processes. In contrast to the rapid localized responses produced by direct interaction 
of G protein subunits with membrane channels, the effects produced by G proteins that ac-

tivate cytoplasmic second messenger systems are slower and more widespread. They include 
contractions of smooth and cardiac muscles, and glandular secretion, among other effects.
β-Adrenergic Receptors Activate Calcium Channels via a G 
Protein—the Adenylyl Cyclase Pathway
One of the most thoroughly studied examples of indirect synaptic transmission mediated 
by an intracellular second messenger is the activation of β-adrenergic receptors in cardiac 
muscle cells by norepinephrine.38,39 This produces an increase in the rate and force of 
contraction of the heart, accompanied by an increase in the amplitude and duration of 
the cardiac action potential (Figure 12.11A). Voltage clamp studies by Reuter, Trautwein, 
Tsien, and others indicate that these effects are accompanied by a marked increase in the 
calcium current associated with the action potential (Figure 12.11B). This increased cal-
cium current is responsible for the increased size of the action potential and the increased 
calcium influx is the cause of the marked increase in contraction.
Single-channel recording from cardiac muscle cells, using the cell-attached mode of 
the patch clamp technique, confirms that stimulation with a β-adrenergic receptor agonist, 
such as norepinephrine or isoproterenol, produces an increase in calcium channel activity 
(Figure 12.12). Moreover, it is not necessary that the agonist be added to the pipette solution 
to observe the response. Adding isoproterenol to the medium bathing the cell causes an 
increase in activity of calcium channels within the patch—a diagnostic test for responses 
mediated by diffusible cytoplasmic second messengers.38

224 Chapter 12
Activation of β-adrenergic receptors is coupled to the increase in calcium conductance 
through the intracellular second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) (Box 12.3). As illustrated in 
Figure 12.13, binding of norepinephrine to β-adrenergic receptors on heart cells activates a 
G protein, Gs. The α-subunit of Gs then binds to and activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. 
Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP, a readily diffusible intracellular second messenger 
that activates another enzyme, cAMP–dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A or PKA). 
The catalytic subunits of this protein kinase mediate the transfer of phosphate from ATP to 
the hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues in a variety of enzymes and channels, 
thereby modifying their activity. In this case, phosphorylation of cardiac calcium channels 
increases their probability of opening.
Several lines of evidence are consistent with this scheme as outlined in Box 12.3. For ex-
ample, calcium channel activity is increased by forskolin, by membrane-permeable derivatives 
of cAMP, by inhibitors of phosphodiesterase, and by direct intracellular injection of cAMP 
itself. Similarly, intracellular injection of the catalytic subunit of cAMP–dependent protein 
kinase leads to an increase in calcium current, while injection of excess regulatory subunit 
or inhibitors of protein kinase block adrenergic stimulation of calcium currents. ATPγS, an 
analogue of ATP, augments adrenergic activation of calcium channels by forming stably phos-
phorylated proteins, while intracellular injection of protein phosphatases prevents or reverses 
adrenergic stimulation of calcium currents by rapidly removing protein phosphate residues.
Subsequent experiments established that the increased channel activity produced by 
protein kinase A resulted from the phosphorylation of the calcium channels themselves.40,41 
Phosphorylation and enhancement of cardiac calcium channel activity is facilitated by a 
scaffold protein called an A-kinase anchoring protein, or AKAP79,42 which binds to protein 
kinase A and targets it to the ion channel. Modulation of the activity of the same L-type 
(CaV1) calcium channels by other hormones is also mediated by channel phosphorylation, 
either through effects on adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase or through 
different second messenger–protein kinase signaling pathways.39
The two-step enzymatic cascade involving adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein 
kinase provides significant amplification compared to direct opening or closing of channels 
by activated G proteins. Each activated adenylyl cyclase molecule can catalyze the synthesis 
of many molecules of cAMP and thereby activate many protein kinase molecules—and each 
activated kinase can phosphorylate many proteins. Thus, the activity of many molecules of

Cyclic AMP as a Second Messenger
Experiments by Sutherland, Krebs, Walsh, Rodbell, Gilman, 
and their colleagues, initially aimed at understanding how the 
hormones epinephrine and glucagon elicit breakdown of gly-
cogen in the liver, led to the discovery of cyclic AMP (cAMP) 
and the concept of intracellular second messengers.43–45 They 
showed that binding of the hormone to its receptor activates 
a G protein, which, in turn, stimulates the enzyme adenylyl 
cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the synthesis of cAMP from 
ATP. The increase in cAMP concentration activates cAMP-
dependent protein kinase, an enzyme that phosphorylates its 
target proteins on serine and threonine residues. The cAMP 
is subsequently degraded by phosphodiesterase to AMP, and 
the phosphate residues on the target proteins are removed by 
protein phosphatases (see Figure 12.13).
Some tests used to determine if the response to a trans-
mitter or hormone is mediated by cAMP depend on activating 
adenylyl cyclase or elevating cAMP directly. For example, intra-
cellular injection of cAMP and addition of membrane-permeable 
derivatives of cAMP, such as 8-bromo-cAMP or dibutyryl-cAMP, 
mimic cAMP-mediated responses. Similarly, direct activation of 
adenylyl cyclase by forskolin mimics the response. Inhibitors of 
phosphodiesterase, such as the methylxanthine, theophylline, 
and caffeine, either mimic or enhance the response, depending 
on the endogenous level of cyclase activity. Other procedures 
test the involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (also 
known as protein kinase A, or PKA). This enzyme is composed 
of two regulatory and two catalytic subunits. In the absence of 
cAMP, the four subunits exist as a complex, with the regulatory 
subunits blocking the activity of the catalytic subunits. When 
cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits, the complex dissoci-
ates, freeing active catalytic subunits. Thus, intracellular injection 
of purified catalytic subunit will mimic responses mediated by 
increased cAMP, while injection of excess regulatory subunits will 
be inhibitory. Additional inhibitors of this enzyme have been de-
veloped, including H-8 (which also inhibits several other protein 
serine kinases), specific peptide inhibitors, and derivatives of ATP 
that cannot be used by the kinase as a source for phosphate 
residues. These inhibitors block responses mediated by cAMP.
On the other hand, treatments that inhibit protein phos-
phatases augment and prolong responses mediated by cAMP. 
These include injection of specific phosphatase inhibitors and 
of ATPγS, an analogue of ATP that can be used as a cosub-
strate by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, forming phospho-
proteins with thiophosphate linkages, which are resistant to 
hydrolysis by protein phosphatases.

a target protein at widespread sites may be modulated by the occupation of a few receptors. 
Moreover, cAMP-dependent protein kinase can phosphorylate a variety of proteins and so 
modulate a broad spectrum of cellular processes. However, all of this takes time. Thus, in 
frog atrial muscle fibers, it takes about 5 seconds after activating the adrenergic β-receptors 
before the calcium current begins to increase. Most of this is taken up by the time needed to 
generate sufficient cAMP. In experiments in which a sudden increase in cAMP was generated 
by flash photolysis of the precursor o-nitrobenzyl cAMP, an increase in calcium current was 
seen within 150 ms.46
Once generated, cAMP is metabolized to AMP by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 
enzymes (PDE) (Box 12.4). Phosphodiesterase activity plays a crucial role in determining 
the duration of cAMP action and in limiting the spread of cAMP from its site of generation; 
this has the effect of compartmentalizing the response of cardiac cell calcium channels to 
nearby β-receptor stimulation.47
CYCLIC AMP DOES MORE THAN ACTIVATE ADENYLATE CYCLASE Not all of the 
effects of cAMP result from activation of adenylyl cyclase. Thus, the increase in heart 
rate produced by norepinephrine is due to a direct action of the cAMP on the channels 
responsible for the pacemaker current in the sinoatrial node (which is where the cardiac 
rhythm in the mammalian heart is generated).48,49 This is an inward current through 
cation-permeant, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels 
that are opened by membrane hyperpolarization.50 Thus, as shown in Figure 12.14A, HCN

channels open during the hyperpolarization after an action potential in the cardiac sino-
atrial node, and the resulting depolarization (the pacemaker potential) triggers the next 
action potential. An adrenergic agonist (in this case isoproterenol) causes an increase in 
the rate of pacemaker depolarization, and hence an increase in action potential frequency 
(a). This is because of an increase in the magnitude of the pacemaker current (b). Graph 
(c) shows that the increased current is due to a shift in voltage sensitivity: in isoproterenol, 
less hyperpolarization is required to activate the current. Records from a membrane patch, 
in Figure 12.14B, show that a similar increase in pacemaker current is produced by cAMP, 
but not by protein kinase A. Thus, cAMP increases the current by acting directly on the 
channels, rather than by phosphorylation. HCN channels are also present in many neurons. 
In some of these, they generate pacemaker currents like those in the heart, but they also 
have other functions.52 Because of differences in channel subunit composition, not all of 
these neuronal HCN channels are affected by cAMP.52
SOME RECEPTORS INHIBIT ADENYLYL CYCLASE An important property of adenylyl 
cyclase is that it can be inhibited by transmitters that act on those metabotropic recep-
tors which couple to the G protein Gi (i = inhibitory). Thus, in the heart, the activation

Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and the phosphoinositide (PI) Cycle
Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) only makes up 
about 1% of the phospholipids in neuronal cell membranes51 
but plays an important role in transmitter action. It is rapidly 
hydrolyzed through activation of the enzyme phospholipase C 
(PLC) when Gq coupled receptors are stimulated. PIP2 itself, 
and the two products of its hydrolysis, inositol-1,4,5-trisphos-
phate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) then act as second mes-
sengers that alter ion channel function and nerve cell activity 
(see Figure 12.15).
Most of the PIP2 resides in the inner leaflet of the outer cell 
membrane.51 It is composed of two fatty acyl chains (arachi-
donic acid and a fatty acid) which insert in the membrane, 
linked through the 1-phosphate to IP3, which is negatively-
charged and hydrophilic, so projects into the cytoplasm. 
Synthesis of PIP2 starts from inositol (in the cytosol) and phos-
phatidic acid (in the membrane), which are combined to form 
phosphatidylinositol (PI). This is then sequentially phosphory-
lated at the 4- and 5-positions on the inositol ring by PI4-
kinase and PI5-kinase respectively to yield PIP2. Phospholi-
pase C (PLC) cleaves off the inositol ring with its three phos-
phates in the 1,4 and 5 positions to give IP3, which goes into 
the cytoplasm, leaving diacylglycerol (DAG) in the membrane. 
PLC works very slowly at rest but is strongly activated by the 
GTP-bound α-subunit of Gq, and hence by metabotropic 
receptors that activate Gq. IP3 is dephosphorylated by inositol 
phosphatase, eventually to inositol, while DAG is phosphory-
lated by DAG kinase to generate phosphatidic acid—thus, 
completing the PI cycle.

of Gi by ACh (via M2 muscarinic receptors) inhibits the activation of adenylyl cyclase by 
β-adrenoceptor stimulation. This action prevents the increase in cAMP and so inhibits the 
increase in calcium current amplitude produced by activating the β-receptors with iso-
prenaline.53 By lowering cAMP, acetylcholine also has the opposite effect of β-adrenoceptor 
stimulation on the cardiac pacemaker current and action potential frequency, as shown in 
Figure 12.14A. This probably accounts for the opposing effects of sympathetic and vagal 
nerve activity on the heart rate at normal physiological rates of stimulation.50
G Protein Activation of Phospholipase C
Activation of phospholipase C (PLC) is the first step in another important G protein sig-
naling pathway. This enzyme is preferentially activated by metabotropic receptors that 
couple to the G protein Gq (see Box 12.1). PLC catalyzes the hydrolysis of the membrane 
phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). This yields two potential sec-
ond messengers: inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which is water-soluble and enters the 
cytoplasm; and diacylglycerol (DAG), which stays in the membrane (Figure 12.15 and Box 
12.4). IP3 releases calcium ions from the endoplasmic reticulum, and hence contributes 
to various Ca2+-dependent processes (see “Calcium as a Second Messenger,” below). DAG 
remains in the membrane where it activates protein kinase C (PKC) to phosphorylate a 
variety of target molecules including some ion channels. One important role for PKC is to 
phosphorylate the ion channels in sensory nerve endings responsible for sensing burning 
pain; this effect contributes to the thermal hyperalgesia produced by the local inflammatory 
mediator bradykinin (see Chapter 21).54 Finally, PIP2 is a signaling molecule, so hydrolysis 
of PIP2 can have functional consequences of its own.

FIGURE 12.15 Signaling by PIP2 and by Products of PIP2 Hydrolysis. When a transmitter stimulates 
a receptor coupled to Gq, the GTP-bound Gq protein activates phospholipase C to induce the hydrolysis of 
phosphatidylinositol-4’,5’-bisphosphate (PIP2). This releases two intracellular second messengers: diacylg-
lycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 releases calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum into 
the cytoplasm. DAG and calcium together activate protein kinase C (PKC). PKC catalyzes increased protein 
phosphorylation. Ion channel function may be modified (1) by loss of PIP2, (2) by PKC-induced phosphoryla-
tion (direct or indirect) or (3) by an effect of calcium (direct or indirect).

Direct Actions of PIP2
PIP2 is required for the proper function of many membrane proteins, including a number 
of ion channels.51 One such PIP2-regulated ion channel is the M-channel, which is a voltage-
gated K+ channel that regulates the excitability of many central and peripheral neurons.55
M-channel currents were first described in sympathetic neurons;56 in these cells, activation 
of muscarinic receptors results in closure of M-channels and membrane depolarization 
(see Chapter 17). Channel closure following stimulation of muscarinic receptors is tightly 
coupled to the hydrolysis of PIP2. This effect was shown using a fluorescent probe that binds 
to PIP2 in the membrane (Figure 12.16). When a sympathetic neuron expressing the probe 
is challenged with a muscarinic agonist, the probe leaves the membrane and moves into the 
cytosol at the same time as the M-current is reduced. It then moves back to the membrane 
as the M-current recovers.57 This particular probe—the pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain 
of phospholipase-Cδ, tagged with the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP), so that it can 
be seen—binds to both PIP2 and to its hydrolysis product IP3. Hence, translocation might 
result from the loss of PIP2 from the membrane or gain of IP3 in the cytoplasm. However, 
other evidence shows that channel closure results from the loss of PIP2, not the formation 
of IP3. Hence, current inhibition is reduced when the amount of PIP2 in the membrane 
is increased, so that it is more difficult to deplete as a consequence of overexpressing its 
synthetic enzyme phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase.57,58 Similarly, a probe that 
binds to PIP2 but not to IP3 also shows a dissociation from the membrane.59
The direct effect of PIP2 on M-channel activity is illustrated in Figure 12.17. The 
constituent potassium channel subunits that make up M-channels (Kv7.2 and Kv7.3;60 see 
Chapter 5) were expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells.61 When the membrane 
potential in a cell-attached patch electrode was set to 0mV, there was modest channel activ-
ity. After pulling the patch from the cell, thereby exposing the inner membrane surface to 
the bathing solution, activity declined but was restored by adding a PIP2 analogue to the 
bathing solution. Using this expression system, the kinetics of all of the steps linking the 
muscarinic receptor to the closure of M-channels have now been examined in detail by B. 
Hille and his colleagues.62–64
A similar signaling pathway appears to be responsible for the muscarinic cholinergic 
inhibition of M-current (and consequent increased excitability) in mammalian central neu-
rons.65 Indeed, loss of PIP2 contributes to the inhibition of a wide variety of PIP2-dependent

the probe binds to PIP2 in the membrane. The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-
M (Oxo-M) (b) stimulates PIP2 hydrolysis and membrane PIP2 falls, so the probe

1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). On washing out the Oxo-M (c), PIP2 is resynthesized

ion channels by muscarinic (and other) receptors that stimulate its hydrolysis, including 
inward rectifier K+ channels, twin-pore K+ channels, Ca2+ channels, and Trp channels.51
G Protein Activation of Phospholipase A2
Another target of G protein action is phospholipase A2. This enzyme acts on DAG and on 
certain membrane phospholipids, such as PIP2, to release the fatty acid arachidonic acid.66
Arachidonic acid modulates neuronal signaling by direct effects on ion channels,67 indirectly 
through activation of protein kinase C,68 and through the actions of its metabolites.69 In 
Aplysia sensory neurons, for example, arachidonic acid is produced in response to recep-
tor activation by the peptide Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH2 (FMRFamide) and is metabolized 
to 12-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE). 12-HPETE, in turn, acts 
to open S-current potassium channels.70,71
Convergence and Divergence of Signals 
Generated by Indirectly Coupled Receptors
As noted earlier (see Box 12.1), a large number of different G protein–coupled receptors 
converge on a much smaller number of G proteins. Accordingly, they can all potentially 
produce the same effects on a neuron. Conversely, activation of one type of G protein can, 
through various pathways, potentially affect several different ion channels and other pro-
teins in the cell. For example, the activity of a single rat superior cervical sympathetic neu-
ron can be modulated by at least nine transmitters acting through five G protein–coupled 
pathways that influence two calcium channels and at least one potassium channel;72 while 
in different guinea-pig sympathetic neurons, muscarinic receptors can affect five different 
potassium currents.73
Selectivity and variation in the cell’s response depends on: (1) what receptors are present 
in that particular cell; (2) which transmitters or hormones the cell actually sees; (3) what

receptors) can activate both Gi and Go G proteins, so as to cause potassium channels to

channel inhibition is seen presynaptically. The reason is that the presynaptic nerve end-
ings do not possess the necessary G protein activated potassium channels.74 An example 
of selectivity between similar receptors is provided again by the sympathetic ganglion. In 
mammals, each sympathetic neuron contains both M2 and M4 muscarinic acetylcholine 
receptors, each of which can potentially activate both Gi and Go G proteins. However, in 
the rat, only the M4 receptor activates Go (to inhibit calcium channels), while only the M2 
receptor activates Gi (to open potassium channels).25,75 These cells also show segregation 
between different receptors that couple to Gq and hydrolyze PIP2. Thus, the hydrolysis result-
ing from activation of bradykinin receptors is accompanied by an increase in IP3 and the 
release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum,76 whereas no release of calcium occurs 
after stimulating the muscarinic ACh receptors even though they hydrolyze just as much 
PIP2 and produce as much IP3.57,59,76 This difference is because the bradykinin receptor is 
held in very close association with the inositol trisphosphate receptor through the actin 
cytoskeleton, to form what may be termed a signaling microdomain.77 The assembly of 
receptors, G proteins, and their immediate effectors into multi-protein complexes—aided 
by cytoskeletal or scaffolding proteins—seems to be quite a common feature of signaling 
through G protein–coupled receptors.78 Likewise, ion channels are frequently assembled with 
signaling protein complexes.79 Such complexes serve both to increase signaling efficiency 
and to segregate different receptor and ion channel signaling pathways.
Divergence of G protein signaling enables a transmitter to generate an integrated 
response of a neuron or an effector cell to stimulation of a metabotropic receptor. 
For example, sympathetic nerve stimulation releases norepinephrine, which acts on 
β-adrenergic receptors in the heart and activates adenylate cyclase (see above). This not 
only modifies the calcium channels to promote an increased entry of calcium during 
each heart beat; it also affects various processes involved in the intracellular storage and 
release of calcium, and in the contractile mechanism itself, to produce a fully coordinated 
response of the heart to fear or excitement.39 In the long term, with persistent or repeated 
stimulation, responses to metabotropic receptor stimulation can extend to changes in 
gene transcription, to produce long-lasting structural and functional changes in the 
innervated neurons or effectors.
Retrograde Signaling via Endocannabinoids
Endocannabinoids (Box 12.5) are further products of phospholipid metabolism in nerve 
cell membranes. They are of obvious interest in view of widespread recreational use of can-
nabis but—more importantly for our purposes—are now known to mediate a widespread 
form of physiological inhibition in the CNS.80 This contributes to several aspects of CNS 
function, including the sensitization to sensory stimulation that occurs in chronic or neuro-
pathic pain,81 and forms the basis for the therapeutic applications of cannabinoid drugs.82
Unlike diacylglycerol (DAG) or inositol trisphosphate, endocannabinoids are released 
from nerve cells into the extracellular space following stimuli that increase intracellular 
calcium (including action potentials) or activate phospholipase C (such as Gq-coupled 
metabotropic receptors). When released in the brain they induce retrograde inhibition of 
transmitter release by stimulating CB1 cannabinoid receptors (see Box 12.5) on presynaptic 
nerve terminals.83,84 Thus, they introduce two new concepts: retrograde synaptic signaling, 
and the release of a transmitter-like messenger that is not stored in synaptic vesicles but 
is synthesized on demand.
Figure 12.18A illustrates this retrograde action in a hippocampal pyramidal cell.85
The records show ongoing inhibitory synaptic currents (downward deflections) due to 
spontaneous release of GABA from the presynaptic terminals. Following a train of action 
potentials in the cell the spontaeous inhbitory activity is almost totally suppressed, and 
takes several seconds to recover. Two additional features characterize this phenomenon, 
known as depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI). First, the postsynaptic 
response to extrinsically applied GABA was unaffected, so the inhibition of transmission

is presynaptic in origin. Second, the response was suppressed by injecting an intracellular 
calcium buffer, showing that the effect depended on elevation of calcium concentration 
in the cytosol. It has been suggested that the retrograde effect is initiated by calcium entry 
into the cell through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. A similar retrograde inhibition 
of both inhibitory and excitatory transmission, depolarization-induced suppression of 
excitation (DSE), has been described in cerebellar Purkinje cells.86,87
The identity of the retrograde messenger as an endocannabinoid was resolved some 10 
years later by three independent groups working on different central synapses.88–90 It was 
found that retrograde inhibition could be imitated by applying cannabinoids and blocked

FIGURE 12.18 An Endocannabinoid Acts as a Retrograde Messenger for Depolarization-
Induced Suppression of Inhibition (DSI). (A) Recording of spontaneous GABA-mediated 
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in a hippocampal pyramidal neuron held at –80 mV. The 
cell was depolarized for 1 second to induce a train of action potentials, which transiently sup-
presses the IPSCs. This effect is called depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, or DSI. 
(B) Suggested explanation for hippocampal DSI. Depolarization (or action potential activity) opens 
Ca2+ channels to produce an influx of Ca2+ ions. This activates phospholipase Cβ1 (PLCβ1) to 
hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol-4’5’-bisphosphate (PIP2), yielding diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG is 
converted to 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) by diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL). 2-AG is then released 
into the interstitial space and activates the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) on the presynaptic 
terminals. The CB1 receptor activates Gi/Go and their βγ-subunits then inhibit Ca2+ entry through 
presynaptic Ca2+ channels; it may also inhibit synaptic vesicle fusion. Metabotropic glutamate 
receptors (mGluR1 or mGluR5) or M1 or M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors can also indepen-
dently activate phospholipase C via the G protein Gq, to generate 2-arachidonoyl glycerol through 
the same biochemical pathway. (A after Pitler and Alger, 1992; B after Hashimotodani et al., 2006.)

by CB1 receptor antagonists, and that it was also prevented in mice in which the CB1 recep-
tor has been genetically deleted. The mechanism proposed for DSI in the hippocampus 
is summarized in Figure 12.18B. Calcium entry enhances the activity of PLCβ1, which, in 
turn, leads to hydrolysis of PIP2 and sequential generation of DAG and 2-arachidonoyl 
glycerol (2-AG) (Box 12.5). 2-AG released from the cell then binds to CB1 receptors91 on 
the presynaptic terminal to inhibit transmitter release. CB1 receptors interact with Gi and 
Go proteins to cause inhibition of calcium channels.92–94 Because calcium influx into the 
presynaptic terminals is reduced, transmitter release is attenuated.94
The release of the endocannabinoid 2-AG is also increased when PLCβ1 is activated 
by stimulating postsynaptic Gq-coupled metabotropic M1-muscarinic or metabotropic

Formation and Metabolism of Endocannabinoids
Two endocannabinoids are known—anandamide and 
2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG). They both contain ara-
chidonic acid (see Box 12.4) linked to ethanolamine and 
glycerol, respectively, and yield arachidonic acid upon me-
tabolism by fatty acid amide hydrolase or monoacylglycerol 
lipase (MGL). They are formed from Ca2+-dependent hydro-
lysis of membrane phospholipids (N-arachidonoyl phospha-
tidylethanolamine or phosphatidylinositol) by phospholipase 
D or phospholipase C, respectively.
The principal endocannabinoid in the mammalian nervous 
system is 2-AG. It is released into the interstitial space where 
it can act on CB1 cannabinoid receptors. These are G pro-
tein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that preferentially couple to 
the G proteins Gi and Go. As a result, they can inhibit adenylyl 
cyclase, activate GIRK (Kv3) potassium channels, and inhibit 
CaV2 calcium channels. Effects of endocannabinoids are rep-
licated by Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (the active principle of can-
nabis or marijuana) and the synthetic water-soluble compound 
WIN-5122, and are antagonized by rimonabant.

glutamate receptors 1 and 5,84 through IP3-induced calcium release. Since stimulation 
of these receptors reinforces the effect of Ca2+ channel opening, the simultaneous occur-
rence of both forms of postsynaptic response reinforce each other, providing a form of 
“coincidence detection.”95
2-AG is synthesized and released from any part of the nerve cell membrane that detects 
a rise in Ca2+ or PLC stimulation. Thus, it can exert diffuse effects. In the hippocampus, 
for example, depolarization of one pyramidal neuron can suppress inhibitory synapses 
on a neighboring neuron.89 Its effect is primarily on inhibitory terminals, where CB1 
receptors are most concentrated, rather than on excitatory terminals.96 In contrast, in the 
cerebellum, retrograde inhibition of excitatory transmission is normally confined to the 
activated synapses, because the postsynaptic calcium signals in the Purkinje cell dendrites 
are highly localized.97 A more diffuse effect may occur during intense stimulation or when 
synaptic excitation is coupled with postsynaptic activation of metabotropic receptors.84
Endocannabinoids may also affect transmission at distant synapses through activation of 
CB receptors on neuroglial cells, with consequent release of glutamate.98
Signaling via Nitric Oxide and Carbon Monoxide
Nitric oxide (NO), a water- and lipid-soluble gas produced from arginine by NO synthase, 
acts as a transmitter by diffusing from the cytoplasm of one cell into neighboring cells and 
activating guanylyl cyclase.99 NO was first characterized as an important regulator of blood 
pressure, mediating the vasodilatation caused by acetylcholine.100,101 Production of NO 
is initiated by the interaction of ACh with muscarinic receptors on vascular endothelial 
cells, which in turn leads to activation of phospholipase C, formation of IP3, and release 
of calcium from intracellular stores (Figure 12.19). Calcium combines with calmodulin 
and activates NO synthase, producing NO. NO diffuses into neighboring smooth muscle 
cells and stimulates the soluble form of guanylyl cyclase, causing an increase in cGMP. 
The cGMP, in turn, activates a cGMP-dependent protein kinase. The resulting increases 
in protein phosphorylation modulate the activity of potassium and calcium channels and 
calcium pumps, leading to a decrease in intracellular calcium concentration and reduced 
Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile proteins, which causes relaxation. NO is inactivated 
within seconds by reaction with superoxides and by formation of complexes with heme-
containing proteins such as hemoglobin. The role of NO in relaxing blood vessel smooth 
muscles explains the vasodilator and hypotensive action of glyceryl trinitrate and other 
nitro-compounds, which release free NO and so act as NO donors. It also explains why

FIGURE 12.19 Paracrine Signaling by Release of Nitric Oxide. ACh binds to muscarinic 
receptors (mAChR) on vascular endothelial cells, activating phosphatidylinositide-specific phos-
pholipase C (PI-PLC). PI-PLC forms inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which releases calcium from 
intracellular stores. Calcium, together with calmodulin, activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS), 
producing nitric oxide (NO). NO diffuses into neighboring smooth muscle cells and stimulates 
guanylyl cyclase (GC), increasing cGMP. cGMP activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). 
The resulting increases in protein phosphorylation leads to a decrease in intracellular calcium con-
centration, causing relaxation. NO is rapidly degraded, so that it affects only nearby cells—hence 
the term paracrine.

Indirect Mechanisms of Synaptic Transmission 235
phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors such as sildenafil (trade name, Viagra) enhance 
and prolong penile erections: erection results from NO-induced cGMP-mediated penile 
vasodilation, and cGMP is selectively degraded to 5ʹ-GMP by PDE-5, so PDE-5 inhibitors 
reduce the rate of cGMP inactivation.
The role of NO as a neurotransmitter was first established in the peripheral autonomic 
nervous system,102,103 where it is released from non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC)
fibers to relax smooth muscle in the same manner as NO released from endothelial cells. 
In this case, however, the stimulus for NO synthetase is Ca2+ entry into the nerve terminals 
during the presynaptic action potential. A role in brain function was first suggested from 
experiments on the cerebellum, in which NO was shown to be responsible for the increase 
in cGMP produced by stimulating the NMDA subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors 
(see Chapter 5).104,105 The NMDA receptor in cerebellar granule cells is closely associated 
with NO synthase, so that the enzyme is activated by Ca2+ ions entering through the NMDA 
channels. The released NO then stimulates guanylyl cyclase in the Purkinje cells or in adjacent 
astroglial cells.106 In Purkinje cells, the cGMP thus formed activates the cGMP-dependent 
protein kinase, leading to phosphorylation and endocytosis of the postsynaptic AMPA 
receptor that subserves normal excitatory transmission from the parallel fibers, thereby 
complementing the effect of endocannabinoid in suppressing transmitter release from the 
presynaptic terminals. Conversely, in the hippocampus, postsynaptically generated NO 
may act as a retrograde messenger to contribute to long-term potentiation of excitatory 
transmission.106 Because it is a freely-diffusible gas, NO formed in one neuron can affect 
the function of neighboring neurons and synapses, up to distances of 100 μm away.107
As with cAMP, not all of the effects of cGMP are due to activation of cGMP-dependent 
protein kinase. For example, the cGMP formed in the retina following the release of NO from 
the illuminated retina directly opens cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels in cone 
photoreceptors; the influx of calcium through these cation channels then increases glutamate 
release from the cone cells.108 Also, NO itself may produce other effects than stimulation of 
guanylate cyclase, such as S-nitrosylation of the ion channel protein by free NO.109
Another endogenously produced gas with properties similar to those of NO is carbon 
monoxide (CO).110 CO is formed from the degradation of heme by the enzyme heme 
oxygenase and, like NO, can activate guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP. In the intestinal 
nervous system, release of CO seems to co-operate with NO in generating the NANC-
relaxation of intestinal smooth muscle since relaxation produced by stimulating the enteric 
neurons is equally reduced in mice lacking NO synthetase or heme oxygenase. CO may 
also have a role in signaling in the CNS, since inhibition of heme oxygenase (like inhibition 
of NO synthetase) can prevent or reverse the induction of long-term potentiation in the 
hippocampus.111,112
Like the endocannabinoids, NO and CO cannot be stored in synaptic vesicles, but are 
synthesized and released on demand. They then diffuse indiscriminately from the site at 
which they are produced into neighboring cells, their spread being limited only by their 
short lifespan. This type of signaling, which is an intermediate between neurotransmission 
and the release of hormones into the bloodstream by endocrine organs, has been termed 
paracrine transmission or, in the brain, volume transmission. Clearly, specificity in the 
effects of such signals depends on the distribution and properties of enzymes activated or 
inhibited by NO and CO.
Calcium as an Intracellular Second Messenger
Calcium is a ubiquitous second messenger.113–115 The concentration of free Ca2+ ions in the 
cytoplasm at rest is around 100 nM (i.e., about 1/10,000th of that in the extracellular fluid). 
One reason for this low concentration of free calcium ions is that most of the cytoplasmic 
calcium is reversibly bound to (buffered by) calcium-binding proteins. Around 98% to 99.8% 
of the total calcium in the cytoplasm is buffered in this way.116–118 Cytoplasmic calcium is in 
dynamic equilibrium with extracellular calcium, and with intracellular calcium stores, prin-
cipally within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. The different mechanisms 
for regulating cytoplasmic calcium concentration are summarized in Figure 12.20.
Since the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions is so low, there is plenty of scope for 
increasing it. From the viewpoint of transmitter action, two mechanisms are predominant. First,

FIGURE 12.20 Calcium as an Intracellular Second Messenger. 
Intracellular Ca2+ ions in neurons are increased by (1) entry through 
voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV) during electrical activity; (2) acti-
vation of calcium-permeable ionotropic receptors (IR) by neurotransmit-
ters such as glutamate and acetylcholine; (3) opening of store-operated 
calcium channels; and (4) activation of G protein–coupled receptors 
(GPCR) that stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) and generate inositol-
4,5-bisphosphate (IP3; see Figure 12.15). The IP3 releases calcium from 
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Depletion of the ER calcium stores by 
IP3 releases another signaling molecule STIM1 that couples to store-
operated calcium channels (SOCs, principally Orai) in the outer mem-
brane (4) to generate a second wave of calcium entry. (5) Most of the 
Ca2+ ions (98% to 99%) are rapidly but reversibly buffered by calcium 
buffers (B-Ca). Cytosolic [Ca2+] is subsequently restored by uptake into 
intracellular organelles—the ER (6) and, at high calcium loads, mito-
chondria (7)—and by extrusion via (8) the plasma membrane sodium–
calcium exchange pump (NCX) or (9) the plasma membrane calcium 
ATPase (PMCA). Messenger functions include: (10) direct activation 
of calcium-dependent potassium, chloride, and cation channels; (11) 
stimulation of vesicular transmitter and hormone release; and (12) bind-
ing to and activation of, calmodulin (CaM). Ca-CaM may (13) modulate 
other ion channels (e.g., activation of small (SK) calcium-dependent 
potassium channels), and activate several enzymes. These activated 
enzymes include (14) nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to generate another 
messenger nitric oxide (NO; see Figure 12.19), and (15) calcium-
calmodulin (CaM)–dependent protein kinases (CaM-kinase). This can 
phosphorylate ion channels (16) and many other molecules, to produce 
a variety of long-term changes in nerve cell function.

Optical methods for imaging Ca2+ transients using fluorescent Ca2+-binding compounds 
(Box 12.6) have revealed other properties of the Ca2+ transients produced by nerve activity 
and transmitter action. For example, increases in [Ca2+] are often confined to particular 
small regions of the neuron, creating calcium microdomains.123–126 This results, in part, 
from the very slow diffusion of Ca2+ ions in the cytoplasm (about one-fiftieth of that in 
free solution127) because of binding to buffers and intracellular uptake. Thus, following 
synaptic activation of glutamate receptors, postsynaptic calcium transients may be confined 
for some time to individual dendrites128 or even to a single dendritic spine.129
Calcium signals in these microdomains often appear as elementary events (variously called 
sparks, puffs, syntillas, etc.), reflecting the opening of single calcium-carrying channels or 
clusters of channels in the membrane or endoplasmic reticulum.130 Though most frequently 
studied in non-neural cells, such events have also been seen in neurons.131,132 Indeed, even 
before calcium imaging, they were detected in sympathetic neurons as spontaneous miniature 
outward currents (SMOCs), signifying the release of packets of calcium from the submembrane 
ER and consequent opening of calcium-activated potassium channels.133 Rises in calcium 
concentration may also appear as oscillations or travelling waves.114 The latter result from 
regenerative calcium-induced calcium release from intracellular stores. In neuronal dendrites, 
the calcium wave can appear as the discontinuous (saltatory) propagation of a calcium spike, 
rather like (but much slower than) the conduction of an action potential along a myelinated 
nerve fiber, as the calcium jumps from one cluster of IP3 receptors to the next.134
Actions of Calcium
A rise in intracellular calcium has many effects on neuronal activity and function, as indi-
cated in Figure 12.20. One direct effect is the activation of calcium-dependent potassium 
channels. An interesting example of this is the inhibition of cochlear hair cells by effer-
ent cholinergic fibers in the auditory nerves.135 Cholinergic activation would ordinarily 
be excitatory, as at the neuromuscular junction. However, calcium entering through the 
ACh-activated channels opens adjacent calcium-activated potassium channels, thereby 
producing inhibition (Figure 12.21A). As shown in Figure 12.21B, direct application of a

(A) In chick cochlea hair cells, ACh binds to nicotinic ionotropic recep-
tors that allow cations, including calcium, to flow into the cell. Intracel-
lular calcium causes calcium-activated potassium channels to open, 
leading to outward potassium current and hyperpolarization. (B) In a 
whole-cell recording (inset), application of ACh near the base of a hair 
cell produces a small, transient inward current (arrow) followed by a 
large outward current. In the intact cell, the outward current would be 
inhibitory. (C) If the calcium chelator BAPTA is added to the recording 
electrode, and hence to the cell cytoplasm, ACh application produces 
only inward current. No outward current is seen because incoming 
calcium ions are chelated and so prevented from activating potassium 
channels. (Records provided by P. A. Fuchs.)

Measuring Intracellular Calcium
Changes in the concentration of intracellular calcium ions are 
usually measured using luminescent or fluorescent calcium-
binding compounds. One of the first such compounds was the 
luminescent jellyfish protein aequorin.136 This comprises a 22kD 
apo-aequorin protein attached via oxygen to a fluorophore 
coelenterazine. On binding three Ca2+ ions, coelenterazine is 
converted to the amide and the complex splits, giving off a blue 
light (peak 460 nm).
Because it binds three Ca2+ ions, aequorin responds to 
a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations (from 0.1 to >100 μM) 
but suffers from the disadvantage that it is broken down after 
binding Ca2+, so the concentration rapidly declines. However, 
because apo-aequorin is a protein, it can be expressed in cells 
from its complementary DNA (cDNA) by transfection. Cells read-
ily take up coelenterazine, and can form aequorin from the ex-
pressed apo-aequorin. Then, by adding a targeting sequence to 
the cDNA, the aequorin can be expressed, and Ca2+ monitored 
in subcellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum.137
Two very widely used calcium indicators are Fura-2 and 
Indo-1, derived from the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-amino-
phenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) by Roger 
Tsien and his colleagues.138 Fura-2 and Indo-1 are excited by 
ultraviolet light and show a shift in their excitation (Fura-2) or 
emission (Indo-1) spectrum when they bind Ca2+ ions. This is 
useful, since the concentration of Ca2+ can be calculated from 
the change in the ratio of the fluorescence at two excitation or 
emission wavelengths. This ratiometric method avoids artifacts 
arising from changes in concentration or fluorescence quenching.
Individually, these indicators cover a narrower range of 
calcium concentrations than aequorin, but many different 
fluorescent indicators are available to cover different ranges 
of [Ca2+]. They are not proteins, so they cannot be expressed 
or directed to specific subcellular organelles. Instead, for this, 
Roger Tsien has devised another type of protein-based cal-
cium reporter termed a cameleon.139 These use calmodulin as 
the calcium-sensor, coupled to a calmodulin binding protein 
and two different fluorescent proteins from a jellyfish (based 
on green fluorescent protein, GFP) with different emission 
wavelengths. When the calmodulin binds calcium, it induces 
a conformational change in the calmodulin-binding protein, 
which brings the two GFP-derivatives closer together so that 
their fluorescences interact (Förster resonance energy transfer, 
or FRET). FRET can be recorded using two different emission 
wavelengths to calculate the concentration of Ca2+ ions.

brief pulse of ACh produces a small transient inward current, which is due to activation 
of nicotinic receptors and is followed by a much larger outward current due to activa-
tion of potassium channels. After the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-
N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) has been added to the bathing solution, activation 
of the potassium channels is blocked and only the inward synaptic current is seen. This 
mechanism is particularly effective because the cochlear nicotinic receptors are composed 
of α9/α10-subunits,140 which have an unusually high calcium permeability.120 A similar 
mechanism of inhibition may occur in some neurons in the brain.141 In both brain and 
cochlea,142,143 the responsive potassium channels belong to the small-conductance (SK, 
KCa2) family; for these channels, the calcium is not sensed by the channel protein itself 
but by closely associated calmodulin molecules.144 Other calcium-activated channels that 
participate in second messenger-mediated responses include calcium-activated chloride 
channels, which contribute to olfactory sensing,145 and cation channels that are activated 
by calcium-releasing metabotropic receptors,146 which may be members of the Trp family 
of cation channels (see Chapter 5).
The principal molecular transducer of calcium actions is the calcium-binding protein 
calmodulin.115 Calmodulin can bind four calcium ions. This induces a conformational 
change in the calmodulin molecule, which allows it to activate or inhibit other proteins. 
These include ion channels, such as the SK-type of calcium-dependent potassium channel 
mentioned above, and the IP3-activated endoplasmic reticulum calcium channels, but the 
main targets of calcium–calmodulin (Ca-CaM) are enzymes, such as calcium-calmodulin–
dependent protein kinases (CaM kinase), calcineurin (a protein phosphatase), and NO 
synthase (NOS). Activation of NOS produces the third messenger, NO (see Figure 12.19). 
CaM kinases can phosphorylate several ion channels147 and play a major role in promoting 
long-term changes in nerve cell function such as long-term potentiation (see Chapter 15) 
and inducing changes in transcription.113,148 Calcium also activates important calcium-
binding enzymes independently of calmodulin, such as phospholipases, protein kinase C, 
and proteases such as calpain.
Prolonged Time Course of Indirect Transmitter Action
Synaptic interactions mediated by indirect mechanisms typically develop more slowly and 
last much longer than those mediated by direct mechanisms. At the skeletal neuromus-
cular junction, only 1 or 2 milliseconds are required for ACh to be released, diffuse across 
the synaptic cleft, and bind to and open ionotropic ACh receptors. These events are much 
too fast to be mediated by enzymes such as adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C, which 
take many milliseconds to catalyze the synthesis of a single molecule of cAMP or the hy-
drolysis of a membrane lipid. Even activation of a membrane channel by binding of a G 
protein subunit to the channel itself tends to have a time course of hundreds of millisec-
onds, reflecting the lifetime of the activated α-subunit. Responses mediated by enzymatic 
production of diffusible cytoplasmic second messengers such as cAMP or IP3 are slower 
still, lasting seconds to minutes and reflecting the slow time course of changes in second 
messenger concentration.
Yet experience tells us that changes in signaling in the nervous system can last a lifetime. 
How can such long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy be produced? One answer comes 
from the properties of several of the protein kinases discussed in this chapter. These enzymes 
are themselves targets for phosphorylation. For example, when activated by calcium, CaM 
kinase II phosphorylates itself.148 It can then become constitutively active and no longer 
requires the presence of the calcium–calmodulin complex for activity. This mechanism 
is one way by which a transient increase in calcium concentration can be translated into 
long-lasting activation of the kinase, which in turn can cause sustained changes in the 
activity of its other target proteins. Activated CaM kinase may be highly restricted in its 
location, to a single synapse or dendritic spine.149
For changes to persist for days or longer, protein synthesis is usually required. Many of 
the second messenger systems described in this chapter have been shown to produce changes 
in protein synthesis.150 Such changes typically occur as a result of activation of one or more 
protein phosphorylation signaling cascades, which lead to phosphorylation of transcription 
factors and, consequently, altered gene expression. The most rapid effects that have been

measured occur in expression of immediate early genes, such as c-fos, which encodes the 
inducible transcription factor Fos. Upon translation, this protein enters the nucleus, where 
it regulates further gene expression, ultimately producing metabolic or structural changes 
that permanently alter the response of the cell.151 The final translational step from messenger 
RNA (mRNA) to protein may then be restricted to individual synapses,151 allowing such 
changes to be confined to specific neural pathways or patterns of neural activity.

SUMMARY
 
■
Neurotransmitters activate metabotropic receptors that 
are not themselves ion channels, but instead modify the 
activity of ion channels, ion pumps, or other receptor 
proteins by indirect mechanisms. 
 
■
Examples of metabotropic receptors include muscarinic 
ACh receptors; α- and β-adrenergic receptors; some 
of the receptors for GABA, 5-HT, dopamine, and 
glutamate; and receptors for neuropeptides, light, 
and odorants. They produce their effects through G 
proteins.
 
■
G proteins are αβγ-heterotrimers. In the resting state, 
GDP is bound to the α-subunit, and the three subunits 
are associated as a trimer. When activated by a 
metabotropic receptor, GDP is replaced with GTP, the 
α- and βγ-subunits dissociate, and the free subunits 
activate one or more intracellular targets. The activity of 
G protein subunits is terminated by hydrolysis of GTP 
to GDP both by the endogenous GTPase activity of the 
α-subunit followed by the recombination of α- and 
βγ-subunits into a trimer.
 
■
Some G protein βγ-subunits bind directly to ion 
channels and stimulate or inhibit their activity. 
Other G protein α- or βγ-subunits activate adenylyl 
cyclase, phospholipase C, or phospholipase A2, 
generating intracellular second messengers that can 
have widespread effects. Changes in membrane 
phospholipids that result from phospholipase C 
activation also affect ion channel function.
 
■
Indirectly acting transmitters influence the activity 
of potassium and calcium channels. The changes in 
potassium and calcium channel activity in turn influence 
the resting potential, spontaneous activity, the response 
to other inputs, or the amount of calcium entering 
during an action potential—and thereby, the amount of 
transmitter release.
 
■
Endocannabinoids act as tertiary messengers. They 
are synthesized and released in response to a rise 
in intracellular calcium. They serve as retrograde 
messengers, inhibiting transmitter release from 
presynaptic endings.
 
■
NO also acts as a tertiary messenger that is synthesized 
and released in response to a rise in calcium. It 
stimulates cGMP formation to affect ion channels in the 
same or neighboring neurons.
 
■
Changes in intracellular calcium or calcium–calmodulin 
concentration regulate ion channels, phospholipases 
C and A2, protein kinase C, calpain, adenylyl cyclase, 
cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and NO synthase.
 
■
Both the distribution of changes in intracellular calcium, 
which can be highly localized, and their dynamics 
(calcium waves and oscillations) are important 
determinants of calcium action.
 
■
Transmitter actions mediated by indirect mechanisms 
have time courses that vary from milliseconds to years. 
Rapid effects are produced by direct changes in ion 
channel activity, effects of intermediate duration by 
activation and phosphorylation of enzymes and other 
proteins, and very long-lasting effects by regulation of 
protein synthesis.

■ CHAPTER 13
Release of Neurotransmitters
T
he stimulus for neurotransmitter release is depolarization of the nerve terminal. Release 
occurs as a result of calcium entry into the terminal through voltage-activated calcium 
channels. Invariably a delay of about 0.5 milliseconds intervenes between presynaptic 
depolarization and transmitter release. Part of the delay is due to the time taken for calcium chan-
nels to open; the remainder is due to the time required for calcium to cause transmitter release.
Transmitter is secreted in multimolecular packets (quanta), each containing several thousand 
transmitter molecules. In response to an action potential, anywhere from 1 to as many as 300 
quanta are released almost synchronously from the nerve terminal, depending on the type of 
synapse. At rest, nerve terminals release quanta spontaneously at a slow rate, giving rise to 
spontaneous miniature synaptic potentials. At rest, there is also a continuous, nonquantal leak 
of transmitter from nerve terminals.
One quantum of transmitter corresponds to the contents of one synaptic vesicle and com-
prises several thousand molecules of a low-molecular-weight transmitter. Release occurs by the 
process of exocytosis, during which the synaptic vesicle membrane fuses with the presynaptic 
membrane, and the contents of the vesicle are released into the synaptic cleft. The components of 
the vesicle membrane are then retrieved by endocytosis, sorted in endosomes, and recycled into 
new synaptic vesicles.

244 Chapter 13
A number of questions arise concerning the way in which presynaptic neurons release 
transmitter. Experimental answers to such questions require a highly sensitive, quantitative, 
and reliable measurement of the amount of transmitter released, with a time resolution in 
the millisecond range. In many of the experiments described in this chapter, this measure-
ment is obtained by recording changes in the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell. 
As discussed in Chapter 11, the vertebrate neuromuscular junction, where the transmitter 
is known to be acetylcholine (ACh), offers many advantages. However, to obtain more com-
plete information about the release process, it is useful to be able to record from the pre-
synaptic endings as well. For example, such recordings are needed to establish how calcium 
and membrane potential affect transmitter release. The presynaptic terminals at vertebrate 
skeletal neuromuscular junctions are typically too small for electrophysiological recording 
(but see Morita and Barrett, 19901); however, this can be done at a number of synapses, such 
as the giant fiber synapse in the stellate ganglion of the squid,2 giant terminals of goldfish 
retinal bipolar cells,3 and calyciform synapses in the avian ciliary ganglion4 and the rodent 
brainstem.5 Moreover, new techniques allow transmitter release to be monitored by means 
that do not require electrical recording from the postsynaptic cell. In this chapter we discuss 
electrophysiological and morphological experiments that characterize the release process.
Characteristics of Transmitter Release
Axon Terminal Depolarization and Release
The stellate ganglion of the squid was used by Katz and Miledi to determine the precise 
relation between presynaptic membrane depolarization and the amount of transmitter 
released.6 Simultaneous records were made of the action potential in the presynaptic ter-
minal and the response of the postsynaptic fiber, as shown in Figure 13.1A. When tetro-

Pre- and postsynaptic axons are impaled with microelectrodes to record 
membrane potential, and an additional microelectrode is used to pass 
depolarizing current into the presynaptic terminal. (B) Simultaneous 
recordings from the presynaptic axons (red records) and postsynaptic 
axon (blue records) during the development of conduction block by 
tetrodotoxin (TTX). As the amplitude of the presynaptic action potential 
decreases, so does the size of the postsynaptic potential. Note that the 
two largest presynaptic action potentials evoke postsynaptic action po-
tentials. (C) The relation between the amplitude of the presynaptic action 
potential and the postsynaptic potential. Blue circles represent results in 
B; red circles represent results obtained by applying depolarizing current 
pulses to the presynaptic terminals after complete TTX block. (A after 
Bullock and Hagiwara, 1957; B and C after Katz and Miledi, 1967b.)

Release of Neurotransmitters 245
dotoxin (TTX) was applied to the preparation, the presynaptic action potential gradually 
decreased in amplitude over the next 15 minutes (Figure 13.1B). The postsynaptic action 
potential also decreased in amplitude, but then abruptly disappeared because the excit-
atory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) failed to reach threshold. From this point on, the size 
of the synaptic potential could be used as a measure of the amount of transmitter released.
When the amplitude of the EPSP is plotted against the amplitude of the failing presyn-
aptic impulse, as in Figure 13.1C (blue circles), the synaptic potential decreases rapidly as 
the presynaptic action potential amplitude falls below about 75 mV, and at amplitudes less 
than about 45 mV, there are no postsynaptic responses. TTX has no effect on the sensitivity 
of the postsynaptic membrane to transmitter, so the fall in synaptic potential amplitude 
indicates a reduction in the amount of transmitter released from the presynaptic terminal. 
Thus, there is a threshold for transmitter release at about 45 mV depolarization, after which 
the amount released, and hence the EPSP amplitude, increases rapidly with presynaptic 
action potential amplitude.
Katz and Miledi used an additional 
procedure to explore further the relation 
between the potential amplitude and 
transmitter release They placed a second 
electrode in the presynaptic terminal, 
through which they applied brief (1–2 
ms) depolarizing current pulses, thereby 
mimicking a presynaptic action potential. 
The relationship between the amplitude of 
the artificial action potential and that of 
the synaptic potential was the same as the 
relation obtained with the failing action 
potential during TTX poisoning (Figure 
13.1C, red circles). This result indicates that 
the normal fluxes of sodium and potassium 
ions responsible for the action potential 
are not necessary for transmitter release; 
only depolarization is required.
Synaptic Delay
One characteristic of the transmitter re-
lease process evident in Figure 13.1B is 
that there is a lag time between the onset 
of the presynaptic action potential and the 
beginning of the synaptic potential. This 
lag time is known as the synaptic delay
(see Chapter 11). In these experiments 
on the squid giant synapse, which were 
done at about 10°C, the delay was 3 to 
4 ms. Detailed measurements at the frog 
neuromuscular junction show a synap-
tic delay of 0.5 ms at room temperature 
(Figure 13.2).7 The time is too long to be 
accounted for by diffusion of ACh across 
the synaptic cleft (a distance of 50 nano-
meters [nm]), which should take no longer 
than about 50 microseconds (μs). When 
ACh is applied to the junction ionopho-
retically from a micropipette, delays of 
as little as 150 μs can be achieved, even 
though the pipette is much farther from 
the postsynaptic receptors than are the 
nerve terminals. Furthermore, synaptic

delay is much more sensitive to temperature than would be expected if it were due to dif-
fusion. Cooling the frog nerve–muscle preparation to 2.5°C increases the delay to as long 
as 7 ms (Figure 13.2B), whereas the delay in the response to ionophoretically applied ACh 
is not perceptibly altered. Thus, the delay is largely in the transmitter release mechanism.
Evidence that Calcium Is Required for Release
Calcium has long been known as an essential link in the process of synaptic transmission. 
When its concentration in the extracellular fluid is decreased, release of ACh at the neu-
romuscular junction is reduced and eventually abolished.8,9 The importance of calcium 
for release has been established at synapses, irrespective of the nature of the transmitter. 
(One exception is the release of GABA from horizontal cells in the fish retina.10) The role 
of calcium has been generalized further to other secretory processes, such as liberation of 
hormones by cells of the pituitary gland, release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla, 
and secretion by salivary glands.11,12 As discussed in the next section, evoked transmitter 
release is preceded by calcium entry into the terminal and is antagonized by ions that block 
calcium entry, such as magnesium, cadmium, nickel, manganese, and cobalt. Transmitter 
release can be reduced, then, either by removing calcium from the bathing solution or by 
adding a blocking ion. For transmitter release to occur, calcium must be present in the 
bathing solution at the time of depolarization of the presynaptic terminal.13
Measurement of Calcium Entry into 
Presynaptic Nerve Terminals
Entry of calcium into the nerve terminal is through 
voltage-sensitive calcium channels of the CaV2 family 
(see Chapter 5) that are activated upon depolariza-
tion by the presynaptic action potential. Using voltage 
clamp techniques, Llinás and his colleagues measured 
the magnitude and time course of the calcium current 
produced by presynaptic depolarization at the squid 
giant synapse. An example is shown in Figure 13.3A. 
The sodium and potassium conductances associated 
with the action potential were blocked by TTX and 
tetraethylammonium (TEA) so that only the voltage-
activated calcium channels remained. Depolarizing 
the presynaptic terminal to –18 mV (upper record in

(A) Records show potentials applied to the presynaptic fiber 
(upper trace), presynaptic calcium current (middle trace), 
and EPSP in the postsynaptic fiber (lower trace). A voltage 
pulse from –70 to –18 mV (left panel) results in a slow inward 
calcium current and, after a delay of about 1 ms (arrows), 
an EPSP. A larger depolarization, to +60 mV (right panel), 
suppresses calcium entry. At the end of the pulse, a surge 
of calcium current is followed within about 0.2 ms (arrows) 
by an EPSP. (B) If a voltage change identical in shape to a 
normal action potential is produced by the voltage clamp 
(labeled Presynaptic), then the EPSP is indistinguishable 
from that seen normally (labeled Postsynaptic). The black 
curve gives the magnitude and time course of the calcium 
current. The synaptic delay between the beginning of the 
presynaptic depolarization and the beginning of the post-
synaptic response is due in part to the time required to 
open calcium channels and in part to the time for calcium 
entry to trigger transmitter release. (After Llinás, 1982.)

left panel) produced an inward calcium current in the terminal that increased slowly in 
magnitude to about 400 nA (middle record), and a large synaptic potential in the postsyn-
aptic cell (lower record). When the terminal was depolarized to +60 mV, approximating 
the calcium equilibrium potential, the calcium current was suppressed during the pulse 
(right panel) and no synaptic potential was seen. This demonstrates that depolarization of 
the terminal is not sufficient on its own to trigger release; calcium entry must also occur. 
On repolarization, there was a brief, inward calcium current through channels remaining 
open after the depolarization, accompanied by a small postsynaptic potential.
The effect of an artificial action potential is shown in Figure 13.3B. A presynaptic ac-
tion potential, recorded before addition of TTX and TEA to the preparation, was played 
back through the voltage clamp circuit to produce exactly the same voltage change in the 
terminal. The postsynaptic potential is indistinguishable from that produced by a normal 
presynaptic action potential, confirming that the sodium and potassium currents that 
normally accompany the action potential are not necessary for transmitter release.
The experiment shown in Figure 13.3B also enabled Llinás and his colleagues to 
measure the magnitude and time course of the calcium current produced by the artificial 
action potential (black curve). The calcium current begins about 0.5 ms after the begin-
ning of the presynaptic depolarization, and the postsynaptic potential begins about 0.5 ms 
later. Thus, the time required for the presynaptic terminal to depolarize and the calcium 
channels to open accounts for the first half of the synaptic delay; the time required for the 
calcium concentration to rise within the terminal and evoke transmitter release accounts 
for the remainder.
An experimental technique important for characterizing the role of calcium transmitter 
release is the use of calcium indicator dyes to estimate intracellular calcium concentrations 
(see Box 12.6).14,15 The first dye to be used extensively was aequorin, a calcium-sensitive 
luminescent protein extracted from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria (see Chapter 12). It has 
now been largely replaced by synthetic compounds that change their fluorescence in the 
presence of calcium, based on calcium chelators such as ethylene glycol-bis[2-aminoethyl 
ether]-N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ-tetraacetic acid (EGTA).
An example of the use of luminescent dye to reveal changes in presynaptic calcium 
concentration is shown Figure 13.4. Aequorin injected into the resting presynaptic terminal 
of the squid giant synapse (A) revealed discrete microdomains of free calcium, some with 
relatively high concentrations (indicated by red and yellow peaks). After a brief train of 
presynaptic action potentials (B), the intracellular calcium concentration reached 100 to 
200 μM.

Localization of Calcium Entry Sites
Figure 13.4 illustrates an important point about the distribution of free calcium in the 
cytoplasm, namely that it is not at all uniform.16 Calcium entering the terminal through 
a single channel collects briefly in a small nanodomain with the concentration falling rap-
idly over a radius of a few tens of nm from the channel as the ions diffuse into the bulk 
solution or are bound by intrinsic calcium chelators. Calcium entering through a group 
of closely apposed channels occupies a microdomain that can spread over a distance of a 
few hundred nm from the channel cluster. Because of the restricted spread of incoming 
ions, the spatial relation between calcium channels and their associated transmitter release 
sites is of critical importance.
Experiments on the squid giant synapse using calcium buffers have provided informa-
tion about the proximity of calcium channels to the sites of transmitter secretion.17 In 
these experiments, injection of 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ-tetraacetic 
acid (BAPTA), a potent calcium buffer, into the presynaptic terminal resulted in a severe 
attenuation of transmitter release, without affecting the presynaptic action potential (Figure 
13.5A). On the other hand, EGTA, a calcium buffer of equal potency, had little effect on 
release (Figure 13.5C). This disparity is due to the fact that calcium is bound hundreds 
of times faster by BAPTA than by EGTA. Thus calcium ions have little opportunity to 
diffuse from their site of entry before being bound by BAPTA, but can traverse some 
distance before being captured by EGTA (Figure 13.5B and D). From the rates of calcium 
diffusion and binding to EGTA, it can be calculated that the calcium-binding site associ-
ated with the release process must lie within 100 nm or less of the site of calcium entry.

On the other hand, similar experiments at some neuronal 
synapses have shown an effect of EGTA on release, suggesting 
that in these cells calcium may diffuse some distance from 
calcium channels to sites that trigger or modulate release.5
Transmitter Release by Intracellular 
Concentration Jumps
Another important technique for exploring the role of calcium 
in transmitter release is the use of photolabile calcium chelators 
that release “caged” calcium upon illumination.18,19 This pro-
vides a means of producing a transient increase in intracellular 
calcium in the presynaptic terminal, divorced from any change 
in membrane potential. An example is shown in Figure 13.6. 
Nitrophen, an EDTA-based calcium cage, was injected into the 
presynaptic terminal of the squid giant synapse. Illumination 
of the terminal with a brief flash of ultraviolet light produced 
a transient increase in intracellular calcium concentration and 
release of transmitter. The jump in intracellular calcium con-
centration, which was estimated to be about 100 μM, produced a postsynaptic depolariza-
tion that closely resembled the excitatory potential produced by nerve stimulation. Similar 
experiments on terminals of bipolar cells from the goldfish retina gave comparable results.20
More detailed examination of the role of intracellular calcium in the transmitter release 
process has been made possible by the utilization of a unique presynaptic structure in the 
vertebrate auditory pathway–the calyx of Held, which forms a glutamatergic synapse with 
neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body. The calyx is sufficiently large to allow 
the attachment of a patch clamp electrode for electrical recording,21 and simultaneous patch 
clamp records can be obtained from the calyx and the postsynaptic cell.22
Using rat brain slices, Bollmann and Sakmann were able to combine the unique prop-
erties of the calyx of Held synapse, the use of calcium indicator dyes, and laser photolysis 
of caged calcium to obtain precise measures of the relation between intracellular calcium 
concentration transients and transmitter release.23 A whole-cell patch pipette was used 
to load the calyx with caged calcium and a low-affinity calcium indicator dye. A second 
patch pipette recorded postsynaptic currents, and electrodes were placed on the slice for 
presynaptic nerve stimulation. As shown in Figure 13.7, a brief calcium transient of ap-
propriate amplitude and time course could produce an excitatory postsynaptic current 
that was indistinguishable from that produced by presynaptic nerve stimulation. Thus, a 
transient increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration can account completely for the 
magnitude and time course of transmitter release.
Other Factors Regulating Transmitter Release
From the evidence presented so far, we can conclude that transmitter release is triggered 
by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, brought about by depolarization of 
the presynaptic terminal and opening of voltage-activated calcium channels. However, at

lular records show the postsynaptic response to nerve stimulation

as rapid as that produced by a presynaptic action potential. The 
decay of the nitrophen response is slower and incomplete because 
the photolyzed nitrophen buffers calcium to a concentration higher 
than the normal level at rest. (B after Zucker, 1993.)

some synapses additional regulatory factors have been shown to be present. In particu-
lar, I. and H. Parnas and their colleagues have shown that presynaptic autoreceptors (see 
Chapter 11) participate in the release process at neuromuscular junctions of the mouse and 
crayfish.24,25 These are G protein–coupled receptors (see Chapter 12) on the presynaptic 
terminals which, when activated by released transmitter, act in turn to inhibit further release. 
As we discuss later in this chapter, presynaptic muscarinic cholinergic (M2) receptors in 
the mouse are continually exposed to a resting concentration of ACh in the range of 10–20 
nanomolar (nM). This concentration is sufficient to block the receptors and thereby pro-
long the decaying phase of voltage-activated transmitter release. An additional feature of 
the M2 receptors is that their acetylcholine binding affinity is voltage-dependent.26 Given 
these two observations, the authors postulated that depolarization of the nerve terminal, 
in addition to opening calcium channels, reduces the binding affinity of the M2 receptors, 
thereby relieving tonic inhibition of the release mechanism and facilitating its activation 
by the incoming calcium. Upon repolarization, the inhibitory action of the M2 receptors 
is restored, so that the release is terminated even though the calcium concentration in the 
region may still be elevated. The exact nature of the coupling between the voltage-sensitive 
autoreceptor and the release machinery is not known. Similar observations on the crayfish 
neuromuscular junction, which is glutamatergic, suggest that the proposed mechanism 
may have more general applicability. However, it does not contribute to the release pro-
cess at the calyx of Held synapse, where depolarization has no effect on transmitter re-
lease triggered by uncaged calcium.27 As shown in Figure 13.7, the time course of evoked 
transmitter release can be mimicked by a transient increase in cytoplasmic calcium with 
no accompanying depolarization.
Quantal Release
So far, the general scheme for transmitter release can be summarized as follows:
presynaptic depolarization → calcium entry → transmitter release
Now that this general framework has been established, it remains to be shown how trans-
mitter is secreted from the terminals. In experiments on the frog neuromuscular junction, 
Fatt and Katz showed that ACh can be released from terminals in multimolecular packets, 
which they called quanta.28 Later experiments by Kuffler and Yoshikami showed that each 
quantum corresponds to approximately 7000 molecules of ACh.29 Quantal release then 
means that any response to stimulation will consist of roughly 7000 molecules, or 14,000 
and so on, but not 4250 or 10,776. At any given synapse, the number of quanta released from 
the nerve terminal in response to an action potential (the quantum content of the synaptic 
potential) may vary considerably from trial to trial, but the mean number of molecules in 
each quantum (quantal size) is fixed (with a variance of about 10%).

Spontaneous Release of Multimolecular Quanta
The first evidence for packaging of ACh in multimolecular quanta was the observation by Fatt 
and Katz28 that at the motor end plate, but not elsewhere in the muscle fiber, spontaneous 
depolarizations of about 1 mV occurred irregularly (Figure 13.8). They had the same time 
course as the potentials evoked by nerve stimulation. The spontaneous miniature end-plate 
potentials (MEPPs) were decreased in amplitude and eventually abolished by increasing 
concentrations of the ACh receptor antagonist curare, and were increased in amplitude and 
time course by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as prostigmine (Figure 13.8C). These 
two pharmacological tests indicated that the potentials were produced by the spontaneous 
release of discrete amounts of ACh from the nerve terminal and ruled out the possibility 
that they might be due to single ACh molecules. Subsequently, patch electrode recordings 
demonstrated directly that the amount of current that flows through an individual ACh 
receptor will produce a potential change in the muscle fiber of approximately 1 μV. Thus, 
a spontaneous miniature potential is produced by the opening of about a thousand ACh 
receptors.Additional evidence confirmed, in a variety of different ways, that the sponta-
neous miniature potentials are indeed due to multimolecular packets of ACh liberated by 
the nerve terminal. For example, depolarization of the nerve terminal by passing a steady 
current through it causes an increase in frequency of the spontaneous activity, whereas 
muscle depolarization has no effect on frequency.30 Botulinum toxin, which blocks release 
of ACh in response to nerve stimuli, also abolishes the spontaneous activity.31 Shortly after 
denervation of a muscle, as the motor nerve terminal degenerates, the miniature poten-
tials disappear.32 Surprisingly, after an interim period, spontaneous potentials reappear in 
denervated frog muscle; these arise because of ACh released from Schwann cells that have 
engulfed segments of the degenerating nerve terminals by phagocytosis.33

cholinesterase from hydrolyzing acetylcholine (ACh), miniature synaptic potentials are increased 
in amplitude and duration, but the frequency at which they occur is unchanged. This observation 
indicates that each miniature potential is due to a quantal packet of ACh, rather than to a single 
ACh molecule. (After Fatt and Katz, 1952.)

Fluctuations in the End-Plate Potential
A typical synaptic potential at the skeletal neuromuscular junction depolarizes the post-
synaptic membrane by 50 mV to 70 mV, many times greater than the depolarization 
produced by a single quantum. In order to find out how this response to stimulation 
was related to the spontaneously released quanta, Fatt and Katz reduced the amplitude 
of the evoked synaptic potential by lowering the extracellular calcium and adding ex-
tracellular magnesium. Under these conditions the responses fluctuated in a stepwise 
manner, as shown in Figure 13.9A. Some stimuli produced no response at all—a failure 
of transmission. Some stimuli produced a response of about 1 mV in amplitude, similar 
in size and shape to an MEPP; others evoked responses that appeared to be two, three, 
or four times larger.
This remarkable observation led Fatt and Katz to propose the quantum hypothesis: that 
the single quantal events observed to occur spontaneously also represented the building 
blocks for the synaptic potentials evoked by stimulation. Normally the end-plate potential 
is made up of about 200 quantal units, and variations in its size are not obvious. In low 
calcium concentrations, the quantal size remains the same, but the quantum content is 
small—perhaps 1 to 3 quanta—and fluctuates randomly from trial to trial, resulting in 
stepwise fluctuations in the amplitude of the end-plate potential.
Statistical Analysis of the End-Plate Potential
Del Castillo and Katz realized that to test the quantum hypothesis adequately would require 
a statistical analysis.34 Accordingly, they proposed that the motor nerve terminal contains a 
very large number of quantal packets of ACh (n), each of which has a probability (p) of being 
released in response to a nerve impulse, and that quanta are released independently—that 
is, the release of one has no influence on the probability of release of the next. Then, in a 
large number of trials, the mean number of quanta released per trial (m) would be given 
by np, and the number of times the response consisted of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4…, or x quanta would 
be given by the binomial distribution (Box 13.1). However, del Castillo and Katz could not 
test their expectation of a binomial distribution experimentally because they had had no

ficulty, they reasoned as follows:
Under normal conditions, p may be assumed to be relatively large, that is a fairly 
large part of the synaptic population responds to an impulse. However, as we reduce 
the Ca and increase the Mg concentration, the chances of responding are diminished 
and we observe mostly complete failures with an occasional response of one or two 
units. Under these conditions, when p is very small, the number of units x which 
make up the e.p.p. in a large series of observations should be distributed in the char-
acteristic manner described by Poisson’s law.34
The Poisson distribution approximates the binomial distribution when p is very small. 
The crucial difference is that to predict a Poisson distribution it is necessary to know only 
m, the mean number of quanta released per trial. In practice, this means measuring the 
average response amplitude and the average miniature potential amplitude. Then:

Statistical Fluctuation in Quantal Release
When del Castillo and Katz saw fluctuations in the quantum 
content of the end-plate potential, they proposed that the 
release was a statistical process and that, consequently, it 
would be possible to predict the variations from one trial to 
the next by the binomial distribution. How does a statisti-
cal process lead to fluctuations, and how is it that these are 
described by the binomial equation? It is useful to look at a 
simple numerical example.
Suppose that a nerve terminal contains 3 quanta (a, b, 
and c), each with a 10% chance of being released upon arrival 
of an action potential, and suppose further that each time any 
one is released it is immediately replaced. If we call the num-
ber of available quanta n, and the release probability p, then in 
our example n = 3, p = 0.1. We will also define q as the prob-
ability that a quantum will not be released. So,
q = 1 – p = 0.9
In any trial, what is the likelihood that no quantum is re-
leased? We will call this p0. The probability of one not being 
released is q = 0.9; and, for all three to not be released:
p0 = q3 = 0.729
To see a single response requires that one quantum be 
released and the other two not. The chance of this is pq2, 
and there are three ways for it to happen: either a, b, or c is 
released, and the remaining two not.
So,
p1 = 3pq2 = 0.243
By similar reasoning:
p2 = 3p2q = 0.027
and
p3 = p3 = 0.001
The sum of all the probabilities (q3 + 3pq2 + 3p2q + p3) 
is 1.0, which means that  we have accounted correctly for all 
possible release combinations.
In 1000 trials, then, we would expect to see 729 failures, 
243 single releases, 27 doubles (yielding 54 quanta) and one 
response with 3 quanta, for a total of 300 quanta.
The average number of quanta released per trial, which 
we will call m, is 300/1000 = 0.3.
So,
m = np
The distribution is called a binomial distribution because 
q3 + 3q2p + 3qp2 + p3 are the terms we get when we multiply 
out the binomial (two variables) expression (q + p)3.
If there are n quanta in the terminal, instead of 3, then the 
probabilities of seeing 0, 1, 2, etc. releases are given by the 
successive terms of the expansion of (q + p)n.
The probability that x quanta will be released (px) is given 
by the relation:
p

The Poisson distribution is based on completely different 
reasoning. It simply describes how the occurrences of random 
(independent) events in time depend on their average over 
time, (i.e., on m). When the quantal release probability, p, is 
small (for practical purposes < 0.1) binomial predictions are 
not significantly different from those of the Poisson distribu-
tion, in which:

It should be noted that while results that conform to the 
Poisson distribution support the hypothesis of a binomial dis-
tribution, they do not confirm it. However, experiments have 
shown that when the release probability is relatively high the 
fluctuations in quantum content are, indeed, described by the 
binomial equation.

If the end-plate potential amplitudes are distributed according to the Poisson equation,

Del Castillo and Katz bathed a neuromuscular junction in a solution containing low 
calcium and high magnesium concentrations and recorded a large number of end-plate 
potentials evoked by nerve stimulation, as well as a large number of MEPPs. When they 
calculated m in these two entirely different ways, they found the estimates in excellent 
agreement, providing strong support for the idea of a Poisson distribution (Figure 13.9B).
A more stringent test of the applicability of the Poisson equation is to predict the 
entire distribution of response amplitudes, using only m and the mean amplitude of the 
unit potential (Figure 13.10). To do this, m is calculated from the ratio of the mean evoked 
potential amplitude to that of the mean MEPPs, as before. Then the number of expected 
responses containing 0, 1, 2, 3, …units is calculated. To account for the slight variation 
in size of the unit, the expected number of responses containing one unit is distributed 
about the mean unit size, with the same variance as the spontaneous events (Figure 13.10, 
inset). Similarly, the predicted number of responses, containing 2, 3, or more units, are 
distributed about their means with proportionately increasing variances. The individual 
distributions are then summed to give the theoretical distribution shown by the continu-
ous curve. The agreement with the experimentally observed distribution (bars) provides 
additional support for the hypothesis.
At many synapses, the probability of transmitter release is sufficiently high that it is not 
necessary to rely on the Poisson distribution to test the quantum hypothesis. Under such 
conditions, the binomial distribution can be tested directly. As before, if we assume that 
the terminal contains n units, each with an average probability (p) of being released by a 
nerve stimulus, then the relative occurrence of multiple events predicted by the binomial 
distribution is:

In summary, there is now ample evidence that transmitter is released in packets, or 
quanta. When the release probability (p) is very low, as in a low-calcium medium, the 
Poisson distribution provides a useful means of analyzing fluctuations. The applicability 
of the binomial hypothesis has been confirmed when the probability of release is high. In 
addition, binomial statistics can provide information as to whether changes in the amount 
of transmitter released arise from changes in the number of available quanta or in the 
probability of their release.
Quantum Content at Neuronal Synapses
One striking feature of the vertebrate nervous system is the reduction in mean quantum 
content as one moves from the neuromuscular junction, where there is little integration 
(m = 200–300), to autonomic ganglia (m = 2–20)36,37 to synapses in the central nervous 
system (CNS; at which m can be as low as 1),38,39 where postsynaptic cells are concerned 
with integrating myriad incoming signals. At the synapse between a primary afferent fiber 
from a muscle spindle and a spinal motor neuron, for example, the mean quantum content 
is about 1.40 This does not mean, however, that transmission fails most of the time, as would 
be expected for a Poisson distribution. Rather, release conforms to binomial statistics, with 
a high probability (p ~ 0.9) and a low number of available quanta (n ~ 1).
Number of Molecules in a Quantum
Although it was clear from the experiments of Katz, Fatt, and del Castillo that at the neu-
romuscular junction one quantum contained more than one ACh molecule, the question 
of how many molecules were in a quantum remained. The first accurate determination 
was made by Kuffler and Yoshikami, who used very fine pipettes for ionophoresis of ACh 
onto the postsynaptic membrane of snake muscle.29 By careful placement of the pipette, 
they were able to produce a response to a brief pulse of ACh that mimicked almost exactly 
the MEPP (Figure 13.11). To measure the number of molecules released by the pipette, 
ACh was released by repetitive pulses into a small (about 0.5 μl) droplet of saline under 
oil (Figure 13.12). The droplet was then applied to the end plate of a snake muscle fiber 
and the resulting depolarization measured. The response was compared with responses to 
droplets of exactly the same size containing known concentrations of ACh. In this way, the 
concentration of ACh in the test droplet was determined and the number of ACh molecules 
released per pulse was calculated. The pulse of ACh required to mimic an MEPP contained 
approximately 7000 molecules.

minal. (B after Kuffler and Yoshikami, 1975b.)

Number of Channels Activated by a Quantum
Given that a quantum of ACh consists of about 7000 molecules, one might expect that 
only a few thousand of these would actually combine with postsynaptic receptors at the 
neuromuscular junction—the remainder being lost to diffusion out of the cleft or hydro-
lysis by cholinesterases. This expectation is correct. The number of receptors activated by 
a quantum can be determined by comparing the conductance change that occurs during 
a miniature potential with that produced by a single ACh-activated channel.41 Measure-
ments of miniature end-plate currents by voltage clamp in frog muscle indicate a peak 
conductance change on the order of 40 nanosiemens (nS). A single frog ACh receptor has 
a conductance of about 30 picosiemens (pS) Thus, a miniature end-plate potential is pro-
duced by about 1300 open channels. (This corresponds to 2600 molecules of ACh, since it 
takes two molecules of ACh to open a channel; see Chapters 5 and 11.) This is similar to the 
number calculated by Katz and Miledi, who estimated the contribution of a single channel 
to the end-plate potential from noise measurements.42 A similar value for the number of 
channels opened by a quantum of transmitter was obtained at glycine-mediated inhibitory 
synapses in lamprey brainstem cells.43 Lower values are observed at other synapses. For 
example, at synapses on hippocampal cells, a quantal response corresponds to activation 
of 15 to 65 channels.39,44
Why are there such differences among synapses? A little thought leads to the conclusion 
that the number of postsynaptic receptors activated by a quantum of transmitter released 
from a single presynaptic bouton must be tailored to the size of the cell. In large cells with 
low input resistances, such as skeletal muscle fibers or lamprey Müller cells, a large number 
of receptors must be activated for the effect of a quantum to be significant. Activation of 
the same number of receptors on a very small cell, on the other hand, would overwhelm 
all other conductances, depolarizing the cell to a potential near zero if the synapse were 
excitatory or locking its membrane potential firmly at the chloride equilibrium potential 
if the effect were inhibitory.
How is the match between cell size and the number of receptors activated by a quantum 
achieved? Is the number of molecules in a quantum reduced, or is the number of available 
postsynaptic receptors lower? Precise values for the number of molecules of transmitter 
in a CNS synaptic vesicle are not available. However, the reported estimate for glutamate-
containing vesicles is 4000,45 which is the same order of magnitude as the number of ACh 
molecules in vesicles at the neuromuscular junction. On the other hand, analysis of quantal 
fluctuations at excitatory and inhibitory synapses on hippocampal cells suggests that the 
number of available postsynaptic receptors is much lower than at the neuromuscular junc-
tion. The amplitude of these quantal events at hippocampal synapses shows remarkably little

variance, suggesting that the number of molecules released in a single quantum is always 
more than sufficient to activate all the available receptors. Conversely, at the neuromuscular 
junction, an increase in the number of transmitter molecules in a quantum can result in a 
larger quantal event.46,47 The difference in available postsynaptic receptors deduced from 
quantal fluctuations is consistent with the difference in synaptic morphology (Figure 13.13). 
Thus, at the neuromuscular junction, receptors are packed at high density (~10,000/μm2) 
throughout a large expanse of postsynaptic membrane, providing an essentially limitless 
sea of receptors for each quantum of transmitter. At a typical hippocampal synapse, the 
estimated postsynaptic receptor density is lower (~2800/μm2),48 and the area occupied 
by postsynaptic membrane is very small (0.04 μm2);49 thus, fewer than 100 postsynaptic 
receptors may be present.
Changes in Mean Quantal Size at the Neuromuscular Junction
Although the size of miniature synaptic potentials at any particular synapse tends to remain 
constant, exceptions occur under certain circumstances. For example, at the tadpole neu-
romuscular junction, various treatments that induce high rates of spontaneous transmitter 
release are followed by the appearance of small-mode MEPPs, which are a fraction of the 
normal quantal size.50 At neuromuscular junctions in neonatal mice, a dominant fraction of 
the overall MEPP amplitude distribution consists of small-mode MEPPs, so that the overall 
distribution is heavily skewed toward the baseline, with no discernable quantal peaks.51
Similar skewed amplitude distributions are seen during regeneration of nerve terminals 
following denervation.52 The origin of these subminiature potentials is not clear. They may 
occur because of incomplete filling or emptying of synaptic vesicles (see the next section).
Conversely, spontaneous synaptic potentials, larger than the usual miniature potentials, 
are seen occasionally.53 In some instances, these appear to be due to the spontaneous release 
of two or more quanta simultaneously; in other instances, their size shows no clear relation 
to normal quantal amplitude. Finally, in some myoneural diseases that afflict humans, such 
as myasthenia gravis, spontaneous miniature and evoked synaptic potentials are reduced in 
amplitude owing to a reduction in the number of receptors in the postsynaptic membrane.54
Nonquantal Release
In addition to being released by the motor nerve terminal in the form of individual quanta, 
ACh leaks continuously from the cytoplasm into the extracellular fluid. In other words, 
there is a steady nonquantal “ooze” of ACh from the presynaptic terminal.55 Indeed, the 
amount of ACh that leaks from the nerve terminal in this way is about 100 times greater 
than that released in the form of spontaneous quanta. Its magnitude can be determined 
by comparing the total amount of ACh released from a muscle, measured biochemically, 
to the amount released as quanta, which is calculated from MEPP frequency and the total 
number of end plates in the muscle.

with the variation in the number of molecules per quantum. 
(B) At a typical hippocampal synapse, postsynaptic receptors 
are packed less densely (~2800/μm2) over a very small area 
(0.04 μm2). As a result, the number of transmitter molecules 
in a quantum is sufficient to saturate the available receptors, 
and quantal events show very little fluctuation in amplitude.

Under normal circumstances, the slow dribble of ACh from the presynaptic terminal 
does not produce a postsynaptic response; the amount of cholinesterase in the synaptic 
cleft is sufficient to hydrolyze most of the ACh, so that the concentration in the synaptic 
cleft is not more than a few tens of nM. Its postsynaptic effect can be detected only when 
cholinesterase is inhibited. In contrast, the simultaneous release of 7000 molecules of 
ACh in a quantum locally overwhelms the enzyme, allowing ACh to reach its postsynaptic 
receptors and cause an MEPP.
Vesicles and Transmitter Release
Shortly after Katz and his colleagues demonstrated by electrophysiological methods that 
transmitter release was quantal, the first electron micrographs of the neuromuscular junc-
tion revealed that axon terminals contain many small membrane-bound synaptic vesicles 
(Figure 13.14).56,57 Thus, it was suggested that a quantum of transmitter corresponds to 
the contents of one vesicle and that release occurs by a process of exocytosis, in which 
a vesicle fuses with the presynaptic plasma membrane and releases its contents into the 
synaptic cleft.58
Ultrastructure of Nerve Terminals
Ultrastructural studies provided support for the vesicle hypothesis of release. Many were 
first made at the neuromuscular junction. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that 
the principal morphological features of chemical synapses are similar throughout the 
nervous system, suggesting that at most chemical synapses, release occurs by exocytosis of 
transmitter-containing vesicles. A schematic view of a portion of the frog neuromuscular 
junction is shown in Figure 13.15, as it might appear if both the pre- and postsynaptic 
membranes were split open by the technique of freeze-fracturing. However, in practice a 
fracture would occur in one membrane or the other, not both at the same time.
In the upper portion of Figure 13.15, vesicles are lined up on the cytoplasmic face of the 
presynaptic membrane along regions of membrane thickening called active zones. Some 
are represented in the process of exocytosis. Along the active zones, intramembraneous 
particles protrude from the exposed fracture face of the cytoplasmic leaflet, and matching pits 
are seen on the fracture face of the outer leaflet. Sites of vesicle exocytosis are visualized as

stalks in the outer portion. Particles on the inner fracture face of the postsynaptic membrane 
represent acetylcholine receptors.
Figure 13.16A shows a conventional transmission electron micrograph of a horizontal 
section through an active zone. It is equivalent to looking down onto an active zone from 
the nerve terminal cytoplasm. An orderly row of synaptic vesicles is lined up along either 
side of the band of dense material. Figure 13.16B shows a corresponding image of the 
fracture face of the cytoplasmic portion of the presynaptic membrane, which is equivalent 
to viewing the same region from the synaptic cleft. Rows of particles, each about 10 nm in 
diameter, flank the active zone on each side. Severed stalks, believed to indicate exocytotic 
openings, appear more laterally. As described earlier, electrophysiological experiments in 
which calcium buffers were injected into presynaptic terminals indicated a close associa-
tion between calcium channels and release sites. Thus, at least some of the pits seen in 
Figure 13.16B might correspond to the voltage-activated calcium channels that trigger 
exocytosis. Results obtained with toxin-binding studies at the neuromuscular junction of 
the frog and the mouse are consistent with this idea.59–61 Omega-conotoxin, which blocks 
neuromuscular transmission irreversibly by binding to presynaptic calcium channels,62
was coupled to a fluorescent molecule. Upon microscopic examination, the fluorescence 
was found to be concentrated in narrow bands at 1-μm intervals, the same spacing as that 
of the active zones in the terminal.
A low-power freeze-fracture image of a frog neuromuscular junction is shown in Figure 
13.16C. At the upper left, the first fracture face is that of the outer portion of the presynaptic 
membrane. The fracture then breaks across the synaptic cleft and exposes the face of the 
cytoplasmic portion of the postsynaptic membrane. Clusters of particles are seen along 
the sides of the postsynaptic folds. These are believed to correspond to the ACh receptors 
that are concentrated in this region of the end plate (see Chapter 11).63–65
Morphological Evidence for Exocytosis

leagues enabled frog muscle to be quick-frozen within milliseconds after a single shock to

the motor nerve and then to be prepared for freeze-fracture.66 With such an experiment it 
was possible to obtain scanning electron micrographs of vesicles caught in the act of fusing 
with the presynaptic membrane and to determine, with some accuracy, the time course of 
such fusion. To do this, the muscle is mounted on the undersurface of a falling plunger, 
with the motor nerve attached to stimulating electrodes. As the plunger falls, a stimula-
tor is triggered, shocking the nerve at a selected interval before the muscle smashes into a 
copper block that is cooled to 4 K with liquid helium. An essential part of the experiment 
is that the duration of the presynaptic action potential is increased by addition of 4-ami-
nopyridine (4-AP) to the bathing solution. This treatment greatly increases the magnitude 
and duration of quantal release evoked by a single shock and hence the number of vesicle 
openings seen in the electron micrographs (Figure 13.17A and B).

Release of Neurotransmitters 261
Two important observations were made: First, the maximum number of vesicle open-
ings occurred when stimulation preceded freezing by 3 to 5 ms, which corresponded to 
the peak of the postsynaptic current recorded from curarized, 4-AP–treated muscles in 
separate experiments. In other words, the maximum number of vesicle openings coincided 
in time with the peak postsynaptic conductance change determined physiologically. Second, 
the number of vesicle openings increased with 4-AP concentration, and the increase was 
related linearly to the estimated increase in quantum content of the end-plate potentials 
by 4-AP—again, obtained from separate physiological experiments (Figure 13.17C). Thus, 
vesicle openings were correlated both in number and in time course with quantal release. 
In later experiments, Heuser and Reese characterized the time course of vesicle openings in 
greater detail, showing that openings first increase during a 3 to 6 ms period after stimula-
tion and then decrease over the next 40 ms.67
Release of Vesicle Contents by Exocytosis
A prediction of the hypothesis that neurotransmitter release occurs by vesicle exocytosis 
is that stimulation will release the total soluble contents of synaptic vesicles. This predic-
tion was first tested, not in neurons, but in adrenal medullary cells, from which chromaf-
fin granules could be purified and their contents analyzed.68 Chromaffin granules are 
organelles analogous to but much larger than synaptic vesicles; they contain epinephrine, 
norepinephrine, ATP, the synthetic enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase, and proteins called 
chromogranins. All of these components are released in response to stimulation of the

adrenal medulla, and they appear in the perfusate in exactly the same proportions as are 
found within the purified granules.
Similarly, there is good correspondence in neurons between vesicle contents and release, 
although it is difficult to isolate pure populations of synaptic vesicles from nerve terminals in 
order to determine their contents. For example, small synaptic vesicles in sympathetic neurons 
contain norepinephrine and ATP; the larger dense-core vesicles contain, in addition, dopamine 
β-hydroxylase and chromogranin A. Stimulation of sympathetic axons results in the release of 
all of these vesicle constituents.69 Similarly, vesicles isolated from cholinergic neurons contain 
ATP as well as ACh, and both are released by stimulation of cholinergic nerves.70
The idea that one quantum of transmitter corresponds to the contents of one synaptic 
vesicle has been examined quantitatively for cholinergic neurons. Vesicles purified from the 
terminals of the cholinergic electromotor neurons in the electric organ of the marine ray 
Narcine brasiliensis (a relative of Torpedo californica) were found to contain about 47,000 
molecules of ACh.71 If synaptic vesicles at the frog neuromuscular junction had the same 
intravesicular ACh concentration, then, making allowance for their smaller size, they would 
contain 7000 molecules of ACh. This is in excellent agreement with electrophysiological 
estimates of the number of ACh molecules in a quantum.29
In summary, there is now much evidence that synaptic vesicles are the morphological 
correlate of the quantum of transmitter, each vesicle containing a few thousand transmitter 
molecules. Vesicles can release their contents by exocytosis both spontaneously at a low rate 
(producing miniature synaptic potentials) and in response to presynaptic depolarization. 
As mentioned earlier, there is evidence that at some specialized synapses in the retina, 
depolarization can release transmitter through transport proteins in the presynaptic 
membrane, a mechanism that is nonquantal, not mediated by 
vesicle exocytosis, and not dependent on calcium influx.72,73
Monitoring Exocytosis and Endocytosis 
in Living Cells
The first quantitative studies of exocytosis were made on dis-
sociated non-neuronal secretory cells, such as mast cells and 
chromaffin cells, in which the discharge of large, dense-cored 
secretory granules could be followed with a variety of techniques. 
These techniques included light microscopy of granules labeled 
with fluorescent dye, measurement of the increase in membrane 
capacitance produced by incorporation of vesicle membrane 
into the plasma membrane of the cell, and amperometry, which 
detects the amines released in response to stimulation.74,75 One 
such experiment is illustrated in Figure 13.18. Exocytosis was 
observed directly in cultured chromaffin cells by evanescent-wave 
microscopy, a fluorescence microscopy technique that greatly re-
duces background fluorescence by exciting only a 300-nm–thick 
layer of cytosol. Chromaffin granules within the cells were labeled

the amperometric electrode detects exocytosis over a large part of the cell, while only 
a small portion of the cell surface is imaged by evanescent-wave microscopy. (After

with a fluorescent dye. The release of catecholamines was measured by amperometry—a 
very sensitive method in which a carbon fiber microelectrode is used to detect transmitters 
by the current they produce when they are oxidized. With evanescent-wave microscopy, 
individual fluorescent vesicles could be seen to dock at the plasma membrane and then dis-
appear as they released their fluorescent contents by exocytosis.76,77 Each time a fluorescent 
vesicle disappeared, the release of a quantum of transmitter was detected by amperometry.
The experiment shown in Figure 13.19 illustrates the use of capacitance measurements 
to monitor exocytosis. A cell-attached patch is made on a chromaffin cell, and inside the 
patch pipette a carbon fiber electrode detects catecholamine release. A sinusoidal signal 
applied to the bathing solution is used to measure changes in capacitance across the patch. 
Catecholamine release by exocytosis is accompanied by stepwise increases in capacitance 
arising from the addition of the granule membrane to the surface of the patch.78
Dye release and capacitance increases associated with exocytosis of vesicles have been 
made in CNS nerve terminals as well. Two examples are shown in Figure 13.20. Figure 
13.20A shows records of dye release from individual boutons on cultured hippocampal 
neurons in response to presynaptic nerve stimulation.79 Vesicles were first loaded with a 
fluorescent lipid marker, with roughly five vesicles/bouton being stained. Stimulation of 
the presynaptic nerve resulted in step-wise drops in bouton fluorescence, indicating the 
exocytosis of individual vesicles and consequent dispersal of the dye.

The capacitance records in Figure 13.20B are from a calyx of Held.80 The calyx was 
pulled away from its postsynaptic neuron so that a cell-attached patch could be made on 
the transmitter-releasing face. Depolarization of the patch, by perfusing the electrode with a 
solution containing 25 mM KCl in order to produce transmitter release, resulted in a steady 
increase in capacitance as vesicle membranes were added to the patch (a). The inset in part 
(b) shows step-wise jumps in more detail. A step increase of 100 attofarads (aF) corresponds 
to incorporation into the patch membrane of a synaptic vesicle about 50 nm in diameter.
Mechanism of Exocytosis
Exocytosis of synaptic vesicles involves the cooperative action of a number of intracel-
lular proteins, principally SNARE proteins attached to the vesicle membrane (v-SNARE) 
and the target region of the nerve terminal membrane (t-SNARE). The term SNARE is an 
abbreviation of Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor.
The interaction between the vesicle and membrane snares leading to 
exocytosis is illustrated in Figure 13.21.81 Attached to the vesicle membrane 
is the SNARE protein synaptobrevin, together with a calcium-sensor, syn-
aptotagmin. Two SNARE proteins are attached to the synaptic membrane, 
syntaxin, and SNAP-25. Figure 13.21A shows the vesicle in the docked position 
over the active zone, held in place by rab3 tethers (not shown). Rab proteins 
are a family of GTPases involved in a number of cytoplasmic functions, 
including targeting synaptic vesicles to appropriate membrane sites.82
The t-SNARE syntaxin is held in a closed state by the regulatory protein 
Munc18-1, and in that configuration it is unable to interact with other 
SNARE proteins.83 Docking is followed by a priming stage (13.21B) in 
which the configuration of the Munc18-1/syntaxin complex is altered so that 
syntaxin is in its open state and assembles with synaptobrevin and SNAP 
25 to form a four-helix bundle that binds the vesicle in close contact with 
the plasma membrane. Attached to the bundle is a cytoplasmic regulatory 
protein complexin, which serves to stabilize the interaction between the 
synaptobrevin and syntaxin helices.84 Upon calcium influx to the nerve 
terminal, the incoming calcium binds to the synaptotagmin, which in 
turn, binds to the snare complex, displacing complexin and initiating pore 
formation (Figure 13.21C).
High-Resolution Structure of Synaptic Vesicle 
Attachments
The scheme illustrated in Figure 13.21 shows how a number of protein 
molecules are arranged to mediate vesicle attachment and exocytosis in the 
active zones. In a remarkable series of experiments utilizing three-dimen-
sional electron microscopy (electron tomography), U. J. McMahan and his 
colleagues have examined the detailed structure of the active zone material 
(AZM) at the frog’s neuromuscular junction.85 Their studies show a highly 
organized array of macromolecules that connect docked vesicles to the pre-
synaptic membrane. Images of these structures are shown in Figure 13.22. 
A central beam, running along the active zone in the presynaptic terminal 
is connected to two flanking rows of vesicles by a series of ribs. Other, more 
detailed, images have shown that the beams are separated from the presynaptic 
membrane by a narrow (≈ 5 nm) gap and are connected to the membrane 
by one or two pegs. The rib-beam assemblies are closely aligned with the 
row of macromolecular bumps seen in freeze-fracture images of the active 
zone (panel i), which form the attachment points for pegs.
Further experiments have revealed even more complex details of the 
molecular structure (U. J. McMahan, personal communication). Each 
docked vesicle is connected to three distinct classes of AZM macromolecules, 
each class lying at different depths vertical to the presynaptic membrane 
(Figures 13.23A and B). Accordingly, three or four ribs lie near the presyn-

aptic membrane, two spars are deep to the ribs, and five to seven booms are deep to the 
spars. Whereas the peripheral ends of the ribs, spars, and booms are connected to distinct 
domains on the membrane of docked vesicles, the central ends of each class are attached to 
distinct classes of macromolecules in a vertical assembly at the midline of the AZM, thus: 
ribs to beams, spars to steps, and booms to masts. Another class of core macromolecules, 
the top masts, link some of the nearby undocked vesicles to the masts; pegs link the ribs 
to the macromolecules in the presynaptic membrane thought to include calcium channels; 
and pins connect the vesicle membrane to the presynaptic membrane away from the main 
body of the AZM.
When the neuromuscular junctions are fixed while the axons are being electrically 
stimulated at high frequency (10 Hz) different stages of vesicle recycling can be captured. 
Thus is it possible to see former docked vesicles in various stages of merging with the 
presynaptic membrane, and undocked vesicles in stages of replacing previously docked 
vesicles. The varied images that are observed suggest a sequence of events like that shown in 
Figure 13.23C. Docked vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane to release transmitter 
while still associated with the AZM (a). As the fused vesicles flatten into the presynaptic 
membrane, they first dissociate from the booms, then the spars, and finally the ribs (b–e). 
Undocked vesicles that come to occupy the vacated docking sites on the presynaptic 
membrane initially form associations with the booms, then the spars, and finally the ribs 
and pins before contacting the presynaptic membrane.
Initial electron tomography studies on active zones of the mouse neuromuscular junc-
tion have shown that the superficial portion of the AZM is also made up of ribs, beams, 
and pegs linked to docked vesicles and presynaptic membrane macromolecules. The active 
zones in mouse are much smaller than those in the frog, and the gross positioning of the

AZM relative to the docked vesicles is somewhat different.86 Altogether, the results indicate 
the AZM at synapses is a multifunctional organelle that directs all phases of exocytosis. It 
seems likely that the proteins revealed by biochemistry to be involved in vesicle docking and 
fusion with the presynaptic membrane (see Figure 13.21) will turn out to be components 
of AZM macromolecules.
Reuptake of Synaptic Vesicles
At neuromuscular, ganglionic, and CNS synapses, periods of intense stimulation have been 
shown to deplete synaptic vesicles and increase the surface area of the axon terminal, indi-
cating that after releasing their contents, empty vesicles flatten out and become part of the 
terminal membrane.87–89 An example is shown in the electron micrographs (Figure 13.24). 
At the resting synapse (A), synaptic vesicles are clustered over a presynaptic membrane 
thickening (release site). In a specimen fixed after prolonged stimulation (B), release sites 
are devoid of vesicles. When fixation is delayed for an hour after stimulation (C), synapses 
have recovered their initial morphological features.
How is the vesicle population restored? Heuser and Reese found that components of 
the vesicle membrane are retrieved and recycled into new synaptic vesicles.90 They studied 
recycling of vesicles in frog motor nerve terminals by stimulating nerve–muscle preparations 
in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), an enzyme that catalyzes the formation

of an electron-dense reaction product. When electron micrographs of terminals fixed after 
short periods of electrical stimulation were examined, HRP was found primarily in coated 
vesicles around the outer margins of the synaptic region, suggesting that these vesicles had 
been formed from the terminal membrane by endocytosis and, in the process, had captured 
HRP from the extracellular space (Figure 13.25A). HRP also appeared, after a delay, in 
synaptic vesicles (Figure 13.25B). Synaptic vesicles loaded in this way with HRP could then 
be depleted of the enzyme by a second period of stimulation in HRP-free medium (Figure 
13.25C), thus supporting the idea that the previously recaptured membrane and enclosed 
HRP had been recycled into the vesicle population from which release occurs.
After particularly intense stimulation in the presence of HRP, large, uncoated pits and 
cisternae containing HRP are seen (see Figure 13.25A). Such uncoated pits and cisternae 
appear to represent bulk, nonselective invaginations of excess presynaptic membrane.88
Presumably, coated vesicles then remove specific components from such cisternae to be 
recycled, directly or through endosomes (Figure 13.26).
Vesicle Recycling Pathways
Proposed pathways for vesicle recycling are illustrated in Figure 13.26.91 The best character-
ized of these is the classic endocytotic pathway, in which vesicles flatten completely into the 
presynaptic membrane following exocytosis, and components are retrieved by endocytosis 
via clathrin-coated pits.92 Other proteins in addition to clathrin serve to identify the appro-
priate constituents for recycling. After retrieval, vesicles lose their coat to reform synaptic 
vesicles and refill with transmitter (orange cores). Following intense stimulation, a second 
pathway is activated in which vesicles pass through endosome-like structures that appear 
transiently in the cytoplasm. The endosomes are probably the result of direct retrieval of 
large pieces of membrane (bulk endocytosis).93
Finally, experiments, such as those shown in Figure 13.20, have suggested that during

of the pore and duration of the opening. For example, dye releases often exhibit smaller 
than average jumps, indicating a restricted loss of dye into the extracellular space.79 Perhaps 
more convincing is the observation that up steps in capacitance are often followed within a 
few hundred milliseconds by down steps of equal amplitude, suggesting that vesicle fusion 
is followed within a short period by retrieval.80 The capacitance “flicker” is often accom-
panied by an increase in membrane conductance, which is indicative of the formation of

a constricted fusion pore between the vesicle lumen and the extracellular space. These, and 
similar experiments on endocrine cells, have been interpreted as evidence for “kiss-and-
run” exocytosis. 94 Kiss-and-run is well established as a mode of exocytosis in endocrine 
cells and, in some circumstances, may underlie a substantial fraction of release.95 Its role in 
release from nerve terminals is less clear. In the calyx of Held, about 20% of the capacitance 
up steps in the membrane patch were followed by down steps within 2 seconds.80 In nerve 
terminals in the posterior pituitary gland, the proportion of fusion events represented by 
capacitance flickers is about 5%.96 These nerve terminals end in free space, rather than 
forming synapses, and contain both large, dense-core vesicles and smaller synaptic vesicles. 
Accordingly, capacitance jumps of two distinct sizes were observed.
Ribbon Synapses
Short sensory receptors (see Chapter 19), and some second-order sensory cells, do not 
generate action potentials. So, transmitter release from these cells is ongoing, rather than 
occurring intermittently in response to action potential activity, and is modulated by 
graded changes in membrane potential. For example, photoreceptors and bipolar cells in 
the retina secrete glutamate continuously at rates that vary with changes in illumination. 
(see Chapter 20). Similarly, release of glutamate by hair cells in the auditory and vestibular 
systems is graded with polarity and intensity of the stimulus (see Chapter 22). Both systems 
are able to transmit graded information accurately and continuously over a wide range of 
stimulus intensities, often at very high rates of release.
This ongoing release of transmitter is associated with specialized machinery not seen at 
phasic synapses–the synaptic ribbon.97 Synaptic ribbons are intracellular organelles that tether 
large numbers of vesicles near the presynaptic active zones (see Chapter 20). Their structure 
varies considerably from one type of synapse to another, but in general, they are anchored to 
the active zone and extend from the synaptic membrane into the cytoplasm (Figure 13.27A).

Calcium entering through channels at the base of the ribbon triggers release of single vesicles (left

queue as release continues. Upon losing their coats, vesicles either remain in the cytoplasm or 
reattach to the ribbon. Alternatively (right side), several vesicles may discharge en masse by 
fusing serially with one another and with the membrane. Recovery may be through large 
endosomes and presynaptic cisterns.

The mechanisms of transmitter release at ribbon synapses are similar in principle to 
those at conventional synapses, with a number of differences in detail. Calcium entry is 
mediated by CaV1.3 and CaV1.4 channels in hair cells and retinal cells, respectively, rather 
than CaV1.2 in conventional synapses. The calcium channels are concentrated in the active 
zone near the bases of the ribbons. The intracellular machinery consists of many of the 
same components as in non-ribbon synapses, but utilizes different isoforms of some of the 
intracellular proteins associated with vesicle exocytosis and recovery.98 The ribbon itself is 
composed largely of the protein RIBEYE.
The role of the ribbon in relation to the release process and vesicle recycling has not yet 
been defined precisely. A summary of proposed schemes for the sequence of events during 
vesicle fusion and recovery is shown in Figure 13.27B.
Vesicle Pools
One way to follow the sequence of events during recycling is by monitoring the uptake of 
highly fluorescent dyes to mark recycled vesicles. This technique, developed by W. J. Betz 
and his colleagues,99 offers the advantage that vesicle recycling can be observed in living 
preparations by monitoring the stimulation-dependent accumulation and subsequent 
release of dye (Figure 13.28).
Experiments of this nature have revealed the presence of two distinct vesicle pools. One, 
the readily releasable pool (RRP), contains the first vesicles to be released upon stimulation, 
and is refilled rapidly by endocytosis. The second, the reserve pool, comes into play during 
depletion of the terminal and refills over a longer period.100,101
The existence of two such pools is supported by a variety of other evidence. For example, 
in the electric organ of the marine ray Torpedo it was found that during stimulation, newly 
synthesized ACh was not spread uniformly among synaptic vesicles, but was localized 
to those vesicles recently formed by recycling.102,103 Studies on mammalian motor and 
sympathetic axon terminals have shown that newly synthesized transmitter molecules are 
preferentially released.104,105 Such results suggest that a subpopulation of vesicles recycles 
rapidly, while most of the vesicles are held in reserve.
The time courses of vesicle recycling vary widely from one synapse to the next. At the neu-
romuscular junction, the RRP is able to refill in about 1 minute through the clathrin-mediated 
cycle, while the reserve pool takes about 15 minutes to recover from depletion and appears 
to refill through surface membrane infoldings and cysternae.98 In contrast, endocytosis in

retinal bipolar cells occurs in two separate phases with time constants of 1–2 seconds and 
10–15seconds.100 The slower component has been shown to be clathrin dependent. The fast 
component is consistent with kiss-and-run recycling, but direct observation of individual 
vesicles with high-resolution imaging techniques have indicated that in these cells vesicle fusion 
is always accompanied by complete loss of FM dye,106 and the vesicle can merge completely 
into the surface membrane and retract with a time constant of 1 second.107
In synaptic terminals on cultured hippocampal neurons the major component of refilling 
has a time constant of the order of 15 seconds 108–110 A faster component, attributed to kiss-
and-run, had a recovery time of about 500 milliseconds.108 At these synapses, pH-sensitive 
fluorescent markers reveal brief exposures of the vesicle lumen to the extracellular space 
during exocytosis, suggestive of kiss-and-run exocytosis, as well as complete washout.111
At the calyx of Held, endocytosis has three components.100 The first has a time constant 
of a few seconds and the second about 20 seconds. After intense stimulation, a third, rapid 
component is activated with a time constant of 1–2 seconds. The first component can be 
attributed to kiss-and-run, on the basis that transient capacitance flickers lasting a few 
hundred milliseconds are relatively common in the terminals.80 The second component 
is consistent with clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the third appears to involve bulk 
membrane recovery.
At ribbon synapses, dye-labeled vesicles have been shown to recycle selectively to the 
ribbons, suggesting that the attached vesicles represent the readily releasable pool. At synapses 
in the retina, good agreement has been found between the readily releasable pool size and 
the estimated total number of vesicles attached to the ribbons. Vesicles in the cytoplasm 
are highly mobile and presumably constitute the reserve pool.

SUMMARY
 
■
When an axon terminal is depolarized, voltage-activated 
calcium channels open, increase the intracellular 
calcium concentration, and cause transmitter release.
 
■
Transmitter is released in multimolecular packets, or 
quanta, that arise when transmitter-containing synaptic 
vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release 
their contents by exocytosis. There is also a continuous, 
nonquantal leak of transmitter from axon terminals at rest.
 
■
The synaptic delay between the beginning of the 
presynaptic depolarization and the beginning of the 
postsynaptic potential is due to the time required for the 
nerve terminal to depolarize, calcium channels to open, 
and increased intracellular calcium to cause exocytosis.
 
■
In response to an action potential, anywhere from 
1 to 300 quanta are released nearly simultaneously, 
depending on the synapse. When the nerve terminal is 
at rest, single quanta are released spontaneously at a 
low rate, producing miniature synaptic potentials.
 
■
Synaptic vesicles contain several thousand molecules 
of transmitter. The number of postsynaptic receptors 
activated by a quantum of transmitter varies considerably, 
from about 15 to 1500, depending on the synapse.
 
■
The distribution of amplitudes of spontaneous miniature 
and evoked postsynaptic potentials can be analyzed by 
statistical methods to determine the quantal size and 
quantum content of the response. Neuromodulatory 
influences that act presynaptically tend to influence 
quantum content; those that act postsynaptically tend 
to influence quantal size.
 
■
After exocytosis, synaptic vesicles may flatten out 
into the plasma membrane. Components of the 
vesicle membrane are then specifically retrieved by 
endocytosis of coated vesicles and recycled into new 
synaptic vesicles. Under certain circumstances, vesicles 
may pinch back off without ever becoming incorporated 
into the surface membrane.

■ CHAPTER 14
Neurotransmitters in the 
Central Nervous System
large number of different chemical substances act as neurotransmitters in the nervous 
    system. Each transmitter subserves one or more particular functions in the brain; since 
    we cannot discuss all of them in detail, we have selected certain of the major transmit-
ters and describe their particular roles in relation to generating and modulating the activity of the 
central nervous system (CNS) and behavior.
In Chapter 11 we described the events underlying direct (or fast) synaptic transmission. In the 
vertebrate CNS, direct excitatory transmission is mediated by the amino acid glutamate, which 
acts on ionotropic glutamate receptors to open cation-permeable channels. Two other amino ac-
ids, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine, act as fast inhibitory neurotransmitters. They activate 
anion-permeable ionotropic GABAA and glycine receptors.
Superimposed on the fast action of these amino acids are the slower, modulatory actions of 
a wide range of transmitters and chemical messengers, mediated primarily through the activation 
of the metabotropic G protein–coupled receptors (see Chapter 12). The amino acids glutamate 
and GABA are included as modulatory transmitters, because, as well as activating ionotropic 
receptors, they also interact with metabotropic GABAB and glutamate receptors. Other important 
modulatory transmitters include: acetylcholine (ACh); the monoamines norepinephrine, dopamine, 
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin), and histamine; and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 
its dephosphorylated product, adenosine. ACh, 5-HT, and ATP also activate separate subsets of 
ionotropic receptors. However, these ionotropic receptors are mostly located on presynaptic nerve 
endings, not at postsynaptic sites, so (except for 5-HT) they rarely contribute to postsynaptic 
responses.
Neurons that secrete norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-HT, histamine, and ACh are for the most 
part confined to special nuclei in the midbrain and brainstem and are relatively few in number. 
Nevertheless, their axons innervate wide areas of the brain and spinal cord, so that these trans-
mitters regulate important global functions of the brain, such as alertness, arousal, sleep–wake 
patterns, and memory recall; their loss causes neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s 
disease and Parkinson’s disease.
Finally, the CNS contains a wide variety of neuropeptide transmitters and hormones, all of 
which seem to act exclusively on metabotropic receptors. These are generally confined to particu-
lar neural pathways. As examples we discuss substance P and the opioid peptides and their role 
in controlling pain; the orexin/hypocretin system and its function in sleep and feeding behavior; 
and the hypothalamic peptides vasopressin and oxytocin and their influence on social interaction.

274 Chapter 14
Chemical Transmission in the CNS
The most fully investigated example of chemical transmission in the vertebrate nervous 
system is that between motor nerves and the skeletal muscle end-plate described in Chapter 
11. At this synapse, ACh is the transmitter substance and the motor nerves that release it 
are termed cholinergic. ACh is also the excitatory transmitter at synapses between pregan-
glionic and postganglionic neurons in the ganglia of the autonomic nervous system (see 
Chapter 17). Hence, it is not surprising that, in seeking excitatory transmitters in the CNS, 
investigators’ first thoughts turned to ACh—especially since it was well known that ACh, 
choline acetyltransferase, and ACh esterase were all abundant in the brain.1 Indeed, early 
work by Eccles and his colleagues did identify one such ganglion-like cholinergic synapse 
that lies between recurrent collateral branches of the cholinergic motor axons and inhibi-
tory interneurons (or Renshaw cells) in the spinal cord.2 However, this (plus a few other 
localized central synapses) proved the exception rather than the rule—indeed even at the 
Renshaw cell ACh has to share transmitter duties with another fast transmitter, glutamate.3
(Acetylcholine is an important transmitter in the brain but has a different function from 
that at the neuromuscular junction, as described later in this chapter.) 
Instead, the role of ACh as the direct excitatory transmitter in the vertebrate CNS is 
replaced by the amino acid glutamate; while two other amino acids, GABA and glycine act 
as direct inhibitory central transmitters (see Chapter 11). For these transmitters, the model 
synapses are not those in the vertebrate peripheral nervous system (PNS) but instead those 
in invertebrates like the crustacean neuromuscular junction and stretch receptor or the 
insect neuromuscular junction (see Box 14.1). It is as though, by some curious evolution-
ary change, the excitatory and inhibitory control mechanisms undertaken in the PNS of 
invertebrates has been brought inboard into the CNS in vertebrates.
The effects of direct excitatory and inhibitory transmission are modulated by a wide range 
of indirect transmitters that enhance or reduce transmission through the synaptic pathways 
in the CNS. These indirect transmitters include both small molecules, such as ACh, ATP, and 
the monoamines (i.e., norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-HT, and histamine), and also a variety 
of neuropeptides. All of these modulators act on G protein–coupled receptors as indirect 
transmitters (see Chapter 12), though some (ACh, ATP, and 5-HT) also activate ligand-gated 
ion channels at specific loci. Many of these modulators were first identified as transmitters 
or local messengers in the PNS. The enteric nervous system (in the gut wall) has been a par-
ticularly rich source of information, especially about peptide transmitters4 (Box.14.2). Most 
of these modulatory transmitters can act on several different subtypes of G protein–coupled 
receptors (see Chapter 12), so their postsynaptic effects on different neurons can vary and 
can be quite subtle and complex. Hence, it is difficult to predict their overall contribution to 
brain function from actions at individual synapses—their functions are often first inferred 
from the overall behavioral effects of pharmacologically blocking their receptors or by deleting 
the genes required for the synthesis of the transmitter or its receptors. 
Mapping Neurotransmitter Pathways
An aid to understanding the physiological role of individual neurotransmitters in the CNS is 
to identify the particular neurons, nerve fibers, and synapses that contain them. Identification 
can be achieved using a variety of histochemical or immunohistochemical methods (Figure 
14.1). For example, the distribution of neurons and fibers containing norepinephrine, dopa-

localizing the synthetic enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT).26

The Discovery of Central Transmitters: I. The Amino Acids
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
Although GABA was originally discovered in the mammalian 
brain,5–7 its inhibitory transmitter function was first established in 
the peripheral nervous system (PNS) of the crayfish. In this and 
other crustacea there are separate, identifiable inhibitory nerves 
that, when stimulated, inhibit the muscle fibers and the sensory 
stretch receptors by increasing their chloride conductance (see 
Chapter 11). In 1954, Ernst Florey8 found that an inhibitory fac-
tor (Factor I) he extracted from brain could block the discharges 
of the stretch receptor, and he subsequently identified GABA as 
the main inhibitory ingredient.9 Two sets of researchers, Kuffler 
and Edwards10 and Boistel and Fatt,11 then showed that GABA 
precisely imitated the action of inhibitory nerve stimulation, 
respectively, on the stretch receptor and the muscle. Through 
much painstaking work, Kravitz and his colleagues12 showed 
that GABA was highly concentrated in crustacean inhibitory 
axons and (crucially) could be released from them when stimu-
lated in sufficient amounts to be a transmitter.
It took longer to establish the role of GABA in the mam-
malian central nervous system (CNS). One reason is that there 
are no discrete inhibitory fiber bundles like those in the crayfish 
PNS. One approach used by Curtis and his colleagues13 was to 
eject GABA ionophoretically around a neuron in the CNS while 
stimulating excitatory and inhibitory inputs. However, they con-
cluded that GABA was not the inhibitory transmitter but instead 
had a general depressant action on the somatodendritic mem-
brane of all central neurons, irrespective of their innervation. 
Using the same techniques, Krnjevic14 and his colleagues took 
a more optimistic view. Using intracellular recordings, they sub-
sequently showed that GABA hyperpolarized cortical neurons 
and increased their membrane conductance, just like stimulat-
ing inhibitory afferents,15 and that both effects were due to an 
increase in chloride conductance.15,16 One reason why Curtis 
and his colleagues rejected a role for GABA in spinal cord inhi-
bition was that its action was not antagonized by strychnine,17 
which was known to block spinal cord inhibitory postsynaptic 
potentials (IPSPs). Spinal inhibition was not blocked by strych-
nine because the principal inhibitory transmitter there is glycine, 
as subsequently shown by Werman and his colleagues.18
Glutamate
It took even longer for glutamate to be recognized as the main 
excitatory transmitter in the CNS. There were several reasons 
why: although it is abundant in the brain, it is not unique to the 
brain (unlike GABA); it excited every central neuron tested; its 
action was replicated by other dicarboxylic amino acids;19 and 
there were no antagonists of synaptic excitation to help identify 
the transmitter. Again, the strongest evidence came from ex-
periments on invertebrates, particularly those of Takeuchi and 
Takeuchi20 on lobster muscle, in which they found glutamate-
sensitive hotspots that coincided with the excitatory postsyn-
aptic potentials (EPSPs) initiated by motor nerve stimulation. As 
they stated, “the receptors which respond to L-glutamate are 
identical with normal neuroreceptors.”20 Glutamate eventually 
gained acceptance as the major excitatory transmitter in the 
mammalian CNS through demonstration of its calcium-depen-
dent release from neurons, the development of specific block-
ing agents, the cloning of the receptors, and the identification of 
glutamate-containing synaptic vesicles.21
Inactivation of amino acid transmitters
One initial obstacle to the acceptance of amino acids as 
transmitters was that there seemed to be no enzyme like 
acetylcholinesterase that was capable of rapidly inactivating 
the transmitters. This issue was resolved with the discovery 
by Iversen22 and others that there are special uptake systems 
by which the released amino acids (GABA, glutamate, and 
glycine) are rapidly re-accumulated into the nerves that release 
them as well as into neighboring neuroglial cells (see Chapters 
9 and 15).

Immunohistochemical methods have now become the method of choice for localizing 
most transmitters and their receptors. By using fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies, 
neurons and fibers containing transmitter-related proteins (such as synthetic enzymes or 
membrane transporters, or, in the case of peptides, the transmitter itself or its precursor) 
can be readily seen and co-localization with other transmitters detected using different 
wavelength fluorophores on the secondary antibodies. Figure 14.3A shows an example in

individual synapses or synaptic vesicles. Thus, the vesicular glutamate transporter Vglut2 
in the glutamate-containing synaptic terminals shown in Figure 14.3A can be seen under 
the electron microscope in Figure 14.3B by using a secondary antibody coupled to the

The Discovery of Central Transmitters: II. Neuropeptides
The first “neuropeptides” in the brain identified and sequenced 
were the hypothalamic hormones oxytocin and vasopressin, in 
1955.27 Since then, more than 60 other central neuropeptides 
have been identified.28 How were they all discovered? The clas-
sical approach is to find an appropriate assay, test extracts from 
brain, and then purify and sequence the active peptides. The 
modern approach is to go for the gene or its messenger RNA 
(mRNA) product. These two approaches are well illustrated by 
the discovery of the enkephalins and the orexins, respectively.
The enkephalins
Enkephalins are two pentapeptides (5 amino acids) that are 
naturally released stimulants of opiate (morphine) receptors. 
They were discovered by John Hughes, Hans Kosterlitz, and 
their colleagues in 1975.29 Morphine itself is a plant alkaloid 
that comes from the opium poppy Papaver somniferum; 
the idea that there might be a morphine-like substance in 
the mammalian brain stemmed from the fact that morphine 
seemed to act on specific receptors. So, there must be an 
endogenous ligand for them. In order to find this ligand, 
Hughes used the mouse vas deferens as a bioassay tissue. 
This tissue contracts when its afferent sympathetic nerves are 
stimulated; morphine reduces this contraction by inhibiting the 
release of norepinephrine. Using this tissue Hughes30 detected 
morphine-like activity in mammalian brain extracts, which 
seemed to be due to a peptide because it was abrogated by 
peptidases. The amino-acid composition of the peptide was 
determined by chemical methods.29 This showed that there 
were actually two peptides: one with the sequence Tyr-Gly-
Gly-Phe-Met, which they termed met-enkephalin, the other 
with the sequence Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu, which was called leu-
enkephalin. Both were shown to replicate the effect of mor-
phine on the vas deferens and to be antagonized by naloxone, 
a known morphine antagonist. 
The orexins
Orexins are peptides that are released from nerves of hypo-
thalamic origin, stimulate wakefulness, and enhance appetite; 
their absence causes the human disease narcolepsy. They 
were discovered independently by two groups of scientists 
starting from what are termed orphan genes—that is, genes 
or gene products that have no known function. One group 
began with the gene for the transmitter itself, the other from 
the gene for its receptor. 
The first group (de Lecea and colleagues)31 constructed a 
complementary DNA (cDNA) library from the rat hypothalamus 
and then made a systematic survey of which messenger RNA 
(mRNA) products of these cDNAs were selectively concentrat-
ed in the hypothalamus. The cDNA derived from one of these 
mRNA products (clone 35) encoded two peptides that were 
concentrated in neurons and synapses in the dorsolateral 
hypothalamus. These peptides excited hypothalamic neurons 
when applied to them.32 They called the peptides hypocretins 
because they were similar to the gut hormone secretin (hypo-
thalamic secretin).
The second group (Sakurai and colleagues)33 started from 
the genes for orphan G protein–coupled receptors. They ex-
pressed the receptors in cell lines and then looked for sub-
stances in brain extracts that stimulated them and increased 
the cell’s intracellular calcium. Again, they purified and se-
quenced two active proteins, and termed them orexin-A and 
orexin-B (because they had an appetite-stimulating or orexigen-
ic action in rats). The researchers also determined the amino 
acid sequences of the responsive receptors, which they called 
OX1 and OX2. This work shows the power of studying orphan 
receptors. There are many such receptors, and they have led to 
the identification of several other neurotransmitters.34,35

Visualizing Transmitter-Specific Neurons in Living Brain Tissue
Certain neurons that contain a transmitter of interest can be color-coded in vivo by using 
transgenic methods. This can be very helpful for subsequent electrophysiological experi-
ments, especially for neurons that are not very numerous. For example, dopamine-releasing 
(dopaminergic) neurons in the mesencephalon can be color-coded with the jellyfish green 
fluorescent protein (GFP, see Box 12.6) by tagging the GFP cDNA onto the cDNA that 
codes for the promoter region of the synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, then ex-
pressing it in mice using transgenic techniques.36 Subsequently, when the mesencephalon 
is dissected and the cells are isolated and cultured, the dopamine-secreting cells are easily 
identifiable by their green fluorescence, even though they contribute only a minority of 
cells in the mixed-cell culture. 
A similar approach has been used to express a fluorescently tagged, light-activated, cation-
conducting protein, channelrhodopsin-2, in the dopaminergic neurons37 (Figure 14.4A). 
Then, dopaminergic neurons in an isolated midbrain slice could be stimulated selectively 
by a brief flash of blue light, which opened the channelrhodopsin channels to depolarize 
the neuron (Figure 14.4B). Selectively expressed channelrhodopsins and related proteins 
are now widely used as a means of stimulating (or inhibiting) neurons,38 particularly for 
analyzing neural circuits in vivo,39 since light stimulation is easier and more versatile than 
electrical stimulation of individual neurons through microelectrodes. This field of research 
has been dubbed “optogenetics.”40,41

The image on the right shows the left and center pictures

the nucleus accumbens (which is innervated by dopaminer-
gic fibers from the VTA) in a slice of the midbrain taken from 
a ChR2-expressing mouse brain. They show short-latency 
excitatory postsynaptic currents generated when the pre-
synaptic fibers are stimulated by activating the ChR2 with a 
5-msec pulse of blue light. The current was inhibited by the 
glutamate antagonist (DNQX, left side, blue line) but not by 
the dopamine antagonists SCH23390 + raclopride (SCH/rac, 
right side). This means that the postsynaptic current did not 
actually result from the release of dopamine itself, but from 
the release of glutamate that is stored in the same nerve end-
ings as the dopamine and that activates ionotropic glutamate 
receptors. (After Stuber et al., 2010).

Glutamate
This is the fast, excitatory transmitter that is released from neurons throughout the CNS. It 
activates two types of postsynaptic ionotropic receptors: fast-opening α-amino-3-hydroxy-
5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors and slower-opening N-methyl-D-
aspartate (NMDA) receptors (see Figure 11.12) The AMPA receptors are responsible for 
normal fast transmission. They are made up of GluA1–4 subunits (see Chapter 5). The 
speed and duration of the evoked synaptic currents varies substantially between different 
synapses, depending on the subunit composition of the channel and on the splice-variant 
(flip or flop43) of the subunit.44 The presence or absence of the GluA2 subunit, and the 
extent of its mRNA editing45 also affect the calcium permeability of the AMPA receptors.46
One important feature of AMPA receptors is that they are not held in the postsynaptic 
membrane so tightly as are the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction, but are 
highly mobile.47 The lifetime of individual AMPA receptors has been estimated at 10–30 
minutes as the receptors recycle between the cell surface and the subsynaptic apparatus.48
Several auxilliary synaptic proteins regulate this trafficking.49 It allows rapid changes in the 
numbers and subunit composition of synaptic receptors during neural activity, providing 
the basis for many forms of synaptic plasticity (see Chapter 16). 
The NMDA receptors are made up of GluN1–3 subunits (see Chapter 5). They differ 
from AMPA receptors in three main respects: the channels open more slowly; they are 
blocked by Mg2+ ions and only allow ions to pass when the membrane is depolarized; and 
they have a much higher permeability to Ca+ ions than most AMPA channels (see Chapter 
11). Their voltage-dependence means that they act as coincidence detectors, only allowing 
current to pass when the neuron is simultaneously depolarized by, for example, high-
frequency activation of AMPA channels, ongoing action potential activity, or co-activation 
of metabotropic glutamate receptors (see below). The consequent entry of Ca2+ ions then 
induces a variety of downstream effects (see Figure 12.20)—most notably, the induction of 
long-term potentiation (see Chapter 16). However, there is also a downside, which is that 
excessive Ca2+ entry through NMDA channels is also neurotoxic (excitotoxic, to give it its 
original name) and can cause neurodegeneration and ischemic neuron death (stroke).50 
Glutamate also activates a distinctive class of G protein–coupled receptors called metabo-
tropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs).51 There are eight of these receptors, mGluR1–8, which 
are divided into three groups: group I (mGluR1,5), group II (mGluR2,3), and group III 
(mGluR4,6,7,8) The group I receptors are the main postsynaptic receptors. They couple to 
the G protein Gq and hence to the phospholipase C–phosphoinositide pathway (see Figure 
12.15). Their activation causes a membrane depolarization and increased excitability, mainly 
by inhibiting Ca2+-activated and M-type, voltage-gated potassium currents. They also release 
calcium ions from intracellular stores by producing IP3. IP3 synergizes with NMDA receptor 
activation in inducing long-term potentiation. Thus, mice in which the gene for mGluR1 
has been deleted52 show defects in long-term potentiation and learning behavior, while 
mGluR5 gene deleted mice show deficits in various forms of learning and habituation.53 In 
contrast, mGluR2, 3, and 4 receptors are more strongly (though not completely) represented 
in presynaptic glutamatergic fiber terminals. There, they couple to the G protein Go, inhibit 
the CaV2 Ca2+ channels and so reduce transmitter release. In this way, they mediate a negative 
feedback control of glutamate release, much like the feedback inhibition of GABA release by 
presynaptic GABAB receptors (see Figure 11.17). When present postsynaptically, they activate 
inward rectifier potassium channels, hyperpolarizing the neuron—the opposite effect to that 
of stimulating mGluR1 or 5 receptors. The mGluR6 receptor hyperpolarizes retinal bipolar 
cells in a different way: it stimulates cGMP phosphodiesterase, producing a fall in cGMP and 
closure of cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels (see Chapter 20).
GABA (γ-Aminobutyric acid) and glycine
These are the two main inhibitory neurotransmitters in the CNS. They activate chloride-
conducting ionotropic GABA or glycine receptors (see Chapter 5) to produce an inhibitory 
postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in the postsynaptic neuron (see Chapter 11). The increase 
in chloride conductance tends to inhibit the generation of action potentials by the excit-
atory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). GABA is the predominant inhibitory transmitter

released by neurons in the cortex and midbrain, whereas glycine plays a prominent role in 
the brainstem and spinal cord. Some neurons have receptors for both transmitters, which 
act on separate and distinguishable chloride channels,54 and both transmitters can some-
times be released from the same neuron.55
GABA and glycine are concentrated in interneurons. Their primary function is to 
control the output of the principal excitatory neurons by negative feedback through 
recurrent inhibitory collaterals from the axons of these neurons. This prevents excessive 
excitatory discharges from the principal neurons. One example (already mentioned) is the 
negative feedback inhibition of motoneuron discharges by recurrent axons that innervate 
glycinergic interneurons (Renshaw cells) in the spinal cord.3 The importance of inhibi-
tory interneurons in the brain is illustrated by the fact that blocking the inhibitory GABA 
or glycine receptors (with bicuculline or strychnine, respectively) produces convulsions. 
However, inhibitory interneurons in the cortex also have more subtle functions. Because 
each interneuron innervates several principal neurons, they serve to coordinate the output 
of the principal neurons and to synchronize activity within networks of neurons.56–58 In 
addition to receiving recurrent collaterals from principal neuron axons, these GABAergic 
interneurons also receive a direct input from collaterals of the afferent fibers to principal 
neurons, producing what is termed feed-forward inhibition.59 This helps to set the timing 
of principal neuron’s response to afferent stimuli.60
RECEPTORS FOR GABA AND GLYCINE Ionotropic GABAA and glycine receptors are 
pentameric (five subunit) receptors homologous with nicotinic ACh receptors but with the 
difference that their structure favors permeation of the anion chloride instead of cations 
(see Chapter 5). The glycine receptor is made up of two α-subunits and three β-subunits, 
arranged as a ring in the order α-β-β-α-β, with four binding sites for glycine at the α-β 
interfaces.61 Three genetic variants of the α-subunit are known (α1 to α3), but only one 
form of the β-subunits (β1). Sivilotti eloquently discusses the mechanism whereby glycine 
opens these channels, as deduced from single channel analysis.62
The GABA receptor has a more complex structure and repertoire of subunits. There are 
19 different subunits: 6 α-subunits, 3 β, and 3 γ, one each of δ, ε, π, θ, and three variants of a 
special ρ-subunit.63 The most common combinations at inhibitory synapses are α1β2γ2 (60%), 
α2β3γ2 (15%–20%) and α3βnγ2 (10%–15%).64 Because different combinations differ in rates 
of activation, deactivation and desensitization, their expression is tuned to the optimum 
requirements for inhibition at different synapses.64 GABA receptors containing the δ-subunit 
are particularly interesting because these do not desensitize and are activated by unusually 
low (sub-micromolar) concentrations of GABA.65 Delta subunits, along with α6-subunits, 
are present in receptors on cerebellar and hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells. They are 
tonically activated by resting interstitial GABA concentrations (estimated at 300–600 nM) and 
so produce a steady component of resting membrane current.66 The ρ-subunits, assembled as a 
homomeric pentamer, make up another unique type of GABAA receptor present in the retina.
The GABAA receptor is also the prime target for a number of important drugs that act 
allosterically to enhance GABA-mediated currents and IPSPs. These include benzodiazepine 
compounds, barbiturates, and certain anesthetics such as propafol, etomidate and the steroid 
anesthetic alphaxolone.64,67 These three groups of drugs bind at different sites on the receptor 
and have different actions. For example, barbiturates68,69 and alphaxolone70 prolong the 
postsynaptic current, by slowing the closure of the channels,71 whereas benzodiazepines 
increase the sensitivity of the channels to GABA (by slowing dissociation) without chang-
ing open time.72 Enhancement of GABAA receptor currents is also responsible for some of 
the effects of ethanol,73,74 which is why one should not mix alcohol with benzodiazepines. 
Naturally occurring regulators of GABAA receptor activity in the brain include endogenous 
neurosteroids75,76 and zinc ions.77
GABAB RECEPTORS Like glutamate, GABA can also activate a G protein–coupled 
receptor. This is termed the GABAB receptor. It was discovered by Norman Bowery and 
his colleagues in 1980.78 They found that GABA reduced the release of transmitters from 
peripheral and central neurons by activating a receptor that was not antagonized by 
GABAA receptor antagonists but could be selectively activated by the GABA analog, ba-
clofen (β-chlorophenyl-GABA). They subsequently identified it as a G protein–coupled

receptor because (among other properties) its action was suppressed by Pertussis toxin. 
In fact, it turned out to be a very unusual receptor because the active receptor is a dimer 
of two closely similar receptors termed GABAB(1) and GABAB(2), conjoined through their 
intracellular C-termini79,80 (Figure 14.5). The B1-subunit has the binding site for GABA 
whereas the B2-subunit is necessary to activate the G protein. Hence, both subunits have 
to be expressed and assembled to make a functional receptor.81
GABAB receptors are located both postsynaptically and presynaptically, and have 
different effects at the two sites.82 Activation of postsynaptic receptors opens inwardly rec-
tifying G protein–gated potassium channels83 (Figure 14.6), which produces a membrane 
hyperpolarization and delayed postsynaptic inhibition.82 These postsynaptic GABAB
receptors are located around the periphery of the synapse (perisynaptically) and do not 
readily respond to GABA released by a single afferent stimulus; instead, they are activated 
by spillover GABA escaping from the synapse during repetitive stimulation or following 
simultaneous activation of several GABAergic inputs.84 
Presynaptic GABAB receptors inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels in the nerve 
terminal and thereby reduce transmitter release. When GABA is released, it may act on 
receptors on its own terminal (autoinhibition; see Figure 11.17) or on adjacent terminals 
that release GABA or another transmitter (i.e., heterosynaptic inhibition). Inhibition of the 
presynaptic calcium current and its consequent effect on transmitter release is illustrated in 
the experiment on calyx of Held terminals shown in Figure 14.7A. These terminals, located 
in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, are large enough to be patch clamped.85 When 
the presynaptic terminal was depolarized by injecting current through the patch electrode, 
application of baclofen reduced both the resulting inward calcium current and the EPSP 
(Figure 14.7B). The reduced EPSP could be explained solely by the reduced calcium cur-
rent since the relationship between inward current and EPSP amplitude was unaltered 
(Figure 14.7C), However, at some other synapses there may be an additional effect of the 
GABAB-released G protein βγ-subunits on the transmitter release mechanism itself.86,87

Dimer. The functional receptor is a dimer composed of GABAB(1) 
and GABAB(2) monomers joined through a coiled–coil domain at their 
C-termini. GABA binds to a part of the extracellular domain of the B(1) 
monomer at a region homologous to the bacterial periplasmic leu-
cine–isoleucine–valine binding protein, or LIV-BP. The B(2) monomer 
responds by activating the G proteins Gi and Go. The α-subunit of Gi 
inhibits adenylate cyclase (pathway 1), while the βγ-subunit activates 
the postsynaptic G protein gated inward rectifier channel (pathway 2). 
The βγ-subunit of Go also inhibits the CaV2 class of calcium channels 
in the presynaptic terminals (pathway 3). (After Couve et al., 2000.)

the K+ concentration threefold, which is near that (+29 mV) expected 
for a K+ current (see Chapters 6 and 11). Note that the curve shows 
inward rectification—that is, the current is larger at potentials negative 
to the reversal potential (when the direction of net K+ flow is into the

rons in the nucleus basalis and medial septum of the basal forebrain (Figure 14.8). Neurons 
in the tegmental area provide a second source of cholinergic axons to the thalamus and 
midbrain dopaminergic areas. These projections are broad and diffuse, and are composed 
of unmyelinated axons. A third, more clearly defined tract, composed of myelinated fibers, 
is the habenulo–interpeduncular tract from the medial habenular nucleus to the interpe-
duncular nucleus. A fourth important group is cholinergic interneurons in the striatum, 
which provide a substantial innervation within the striatum and in the olfactory tubercle.89
One important difference between the central and peripheral cholinergic systems con-
cerns the sites at which ACh is released from the cholinergic fibers. Thus, while some of the 
cholinergic axons to the cortex end at morphologically defined synapses onto pyramidal cell 
dendrites,90 akin to those described in Chapter 11, most release sites in the cortex consist of 
swellings (or varicosities) along the axons that do not make direct contact with the postsyn-
aptic neuron.91 Localized release of ACh from these varicosities has been recorded in tissue 
culture.92 The release process is as rapid as at true synapses but may occur some distance from 
its target receptors, so ACh acts diffusely, rather like a local hormone.93 This action is also true 
for most of the other transmitters described below and is sometimes referred to as volume 
transmission94 or (less flatteringly) the soup theory of transmission.95 Once released, the 
ACh can then act on both ionotropic nicotinic and G protein–coupled muscarinic receptors. 
NICOTINIC RECEPTORS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS Neuronal nicotinic receptors96,97 are 
structurally homologous to those at the neuromuscular synapse, but the pentamer is made 
up of only two types of subunit, α and β. There are nine neuronal α-subunits (α2 to α10) 
and three β-subunits (β2 to β4). The different combinations vary in sensitivity to ACh and 
in their rates of desensitization.98 The main types in the brain are α4β2-heteromers and 
homomers of α7, but there are many others, with varying α-β stoichiometries.99 The α7-
channels are important because they have a high permeability to Ca2+ ions; they are also 
the only neuronal channels blocked by α-bungarotoxin (see Chapter 11).
Although there are a few synapses where the receptors are in the postsynaptic membrane 
and generate a true EPSP (including the spinal Renshaw cell discussed earlier), these are 
quite exceptional: the vast majority of the receptors are on presynaptic axons and termi-
nals.97,98 Here, they serve to increase the release of other transmitters such as glutamate. 
This effect has been clearly shown at synapses between fibers in the interpeduncular tract 
and neurons in the interpeduncular nucleus (Figure 14.9).100 At this synapse, synaptic 
transmission is mediated by glutamate,101 even though the fibers themselves contain ACh. 
Nicotine increased both the glutamatergic EPSC following afferent stimulation and the 
frequency of spontaneous EPSCs. These effects were due to an increase in Ca2+ entry into 
the interpeduncular fibers. They were blocked by α-bungarotoxin, indicating that the Ca2+
entry was mediated by α7-nicotinic receptors.

Nicotinic ACh receptors were so-called because they are activated by nicotine. The ques-
tion then arises: do the effects of inhaling nicotine result from activating these presynaptic 
nicotinic receptors? The answer seems to be yes. Thus, nicotine increases glutamate release 
from excitatory afferent fibers innervating dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental 
area.102 This causes a persistent increase in the activity of these neurons and increased 
release of dopamine from their terminals in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex, 
which is thought to be responsible for the pleasurable (rewarding) aspect of nicotine’s ac-
tion103 (see the section on dopamine below). Alpha4/beta2-containing nicotinic receptors 
are particularly involved in some of the effects of nicotine,104 and a partial agonist of these 
receptors, verenicline,105 is used to treat nicotine addiction.
MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS AND THEIR EFFECTS Most of the effects of ACh released 
from the cholinergic nerves to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia, as de-
picted in Figure 14.8, are mediated by muscarinic receptors.106 There are five subtypes of 
this receptor, M1 through M5. The odd-numbered ones (mainly M1 and M3) link to the 
G protein Gq; their immediate effect is to stimulate hydrolysis of the membrane phospho-
lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. They are predominantly postsynaptic and 
their principal effect is to produce a form of postsynaptic excitation. The receptors are not 
actually located within the subsynaptic membrane itself but just outside the synapse,107 and 
respond to diffusively released ACh, as discussed above. The even-numbered receptors (M2 
and M4) link to the G proteins Go and Gi. They are primarily presynaptic where they inhibit 
transmitter release, but some are postsynaptic and cause a form of postsynaptic inhibition.
• Postsynaptic excitation A characteristic form of muscarinic excitation is that seen in 
hippocampal pyramidal neurons after stimulating cholinergic afferents from the me-
dial septum (Figure 14.10). This consists of a slow depolarization and enhanced action 
potential discharges.108 It results from the inhibition of two types of K+ channel: (1) a 
calcium-activated K+ channel that normally generates a long-lasting (“slow”) afterhy-
perpolarization (sAHP) following an action potential109 and (2) the M-channel.110,111
Inhibition of the slow afterhyperpolarization increases the frequency and duration of 
action potential discharges; inhibition of M-channel causes depolarization and en-
hances excitability by lowering the threshold for action potential generation in the axon 
initial segment.112 Similar effects are seen in cerebral cortical pyramidal neurons113,114
(innervated from the basal forebrain); inhibition of the M-current also accounts for the 
cholinergic excitation of medium spiny neurons in the striatum.115 Cholinergic afferents 
also excite inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampus and cortex that indirectly inhibit 
the principal neurons. This has a strong influence on cortical network behavior.116
• Postsynaptic inhibition Activation of muscarinic receptors directly inhibits some 
cortical neurons. There are two ways in which this can happen. First, in some cortical 
pyramidal cells, activation of postsynaptic M1 receptors can produce inhibition, prob-
ably by releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores, which in turn activates calcium-
dependent K+ channels.117 Second, a minority of neurons have postsynaptic Gi-cou-
pled M2 or M4 receptors that hyperpolarize neurons by activating inward rectifier 
(Kir) K+ channels118 (see Figure 12.7).

Neurotransmitters in the Central Nervous System 285
• Presynaptic inhibition The release of ACh from cholinergic fibers is subject to pro-
found feedback inhibition by presynaptically located M2 and M4 receptors. Dudar and 
Szerb119 first noted this phenomenon in 1969 when they were measuring the release of 
ACh from the surface of the cat cerebral cortex following activation of the ascending 
reticular formation. They found that the amount of ACh collected was increased three-
fold when the muscarinic antagonist atropine was added to the collecting cup (Figure 
14.11A). The mechanism responsible for this effect cannot be easily studied in the brain 
itself but has been explored in tissue-cultured cholinergic basal forebrain neurons where 
the release of ACh from individual varicosities along their axons can be recorded with 
a nicotinic receptor detector patch (see Figure 15.9). The muscarinic agonist muscarine 
dramatically reduced this release92 (Figure 14.11B). This effect is due to the activation of 
M4 receptors and probably results from the inhibition of the axonal calcium current by 
the activated G protein.120 These presynaptic M2 and M4 receptors are very widely dis-
tributed in the nervous system. For example, they inhibit ACh release from cholinergic 
nerve endings in the hippocampus and striatum.121 
OVERALL CONTRIBUTIONS TO BRAIN FUNCTION The ascending cholinergic system to 
the cortex and hippocampus plays a crucial role in attention122 and memory.123 In the cortex, 
ACh focuses attention to sensory information by selectively augmenting the responses of 
cortical neurons to a specific stimulus without increasing their background activity.124–126

to record from a neuron in the pyramidal cell layer. (B) Stratum oriens stimulation for 5 seconds 
at 20 Hz produces: (a) summed fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials due to glutamate release 
(probably from the cholinergic fibers; see Chapter 15); (b) summed inhibitory synaptic potentials 
due to GABA release from interneurons; and (c) a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential. The lat-
ter is enhanced by the anticholinesterase eserine (physostigmine) and suppressed by the musca-
rinic receptor antagonist atropine. This effect of atropine shows that the slow excitatory postsyn-
aptic potential results from activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. (A after Nicoll, 1985;

Importantly, degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and of their cortical 
and hippocampal terminals is the earliest and most profound neurodegenerative change 
seen in Alzheimer’s disease, and it makes a major contribution to the cognitive deficits 
that occur in this condition.127,128 The cholinergic interneurons in the basal ganglia have 
a different role in regulating motor output. Thus, muscarinic receptor antagonists were 
once used to reduce the tremor in Parkinson’s disease before being replaced by more ef-
fective dopaminergic agonists.

FIGURE 14.11 Muscarinic Auto-Receptors Inhibit Acetylcholine Release from Choliner-
gic Forebrain Afferents. (A) Acetylcholine (ACh) released from the surface of the parietal cortex 
of an anesthetized cat was collected into a cortical cup every 10 minutes and subsequently as-
sayed. Local stimulation (LOC) of cholinergic afferent fibers and stimulation of midbrain reticular 
formation (RF) are shown. The muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine (1 μg/ml), added to the 
cup enhanced evoked release. (B) Currents recorded from a nicotinic receptor detector patch 
placed adjacent to an ACh release site on a neurite from a tissue-cultured basal forebrain neuron. 
The neuron was stimulated to give an action potential once per minute, which travelled down the 
neurite. The ACh released following each action potential triggered a burst of nicotinic channel 
openings in the detector patch. Muscarine (10 μM) strongly reduced the amount of ACh released.

Neurotransmitters in the Central Nervous System 287
Biogenic Amines
Biogenic amines include norepinephrine, 5-HT, dopamine, 
and histamine. They are notable for the fact that they are 
restricted to a very few neurons contained in discrete 
loci. However, from these nuclei, ramifying unmyelinated 
axons project to innervate large areas of the brain, through 
which they influence many states of brain function such 
as attention, arousal, sleep, and mood. In most cases, these 
axons do not terminate at discrete synapses; instead, like 
ACh, the transmitters are released from varicosities along 
the course of the axons and act in a diffuse manner called 
volume transmission.129 These actions correlate with the 
fact that, with the one exception of 5-HT, their target re-
ceptors are all indirect G protein–coupled receptors that 
are adapted to respond to relatively low concentrations of 
transmitter on a slow time scale (see Chapter 12). Further, 
there are often many subtypes of receptor for each amine 
capable of affecting several different ion channels, so their 
effects on neuronal activity can be complex and varied. 
NOREPINEPHRINE The noradrenergic neurons are con-
centrated in a nucleus in the dorsal part of the pons called 
the locus coeruleus (or blue spot, the blue being from mela-
nin).130–132 In the rat, each locus (either side of the midline) 
contains only about 1500 neurons (in humans, about 12,000); however, the axons of these 
neurons innervate wide areas of the CNS, including large parts of the cerebral cortex (via 
the medial forebrain bundle), hippocampus, hypothalamus, and amygdala, and they even 
run down the spinal cord133 (Figure 14.12).
The locus coeruleus neurons fire spontaneously both in vivo and in vitro at a steady 
low rate, which can then be modified by the release of glutamate, GABA, enkephalins, and 
other transmitters from their afferent inputs.131,134 Their firing rate can also be inhibited 
by norepinephrine, through α2-adrenoceptors; these hyperpolarize the neuron by open-
ing potassium channels.135,136 By this means, release of norepinephrine within the locus 
coeruleus exerts a negative-feedback control of the neurons’ intrinsic firing rate.137
The primary effect of norepinephrine on its target neurons in the hippocampus and 
cerebral cortex is to inhibit the slow calcium-activated potassium current.131,138 This ac-
tion is mediated by β2-adrenoceptors and involves activation of adenylate cyclase.139 Its 
effect is to increase the firing rate of the neuron. Norepinephrine also hyperpolarizes the 
target neurons by activating α2-receptors, as it does to the locus coeruleus neurons. The 
hyperpolarization reduces background activity while the potassium current inhibition 
facilitates responses to strong afferent stimulation. These actions enable afferents from the 
locus coeruleus to augment and sharpen the response of cortical pyramidal cells to the 
sensory stimulus of interest without increasing noise, as illustrated in Figure 14.13. By such 
means, the locus coeruleus can increase attention and facilitate learning and memory.140
5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE (5-HT OR SEROTONIN) Like the noradrenergic neurons, 
serotonergic neurons are localized to a few nuclei in the brainstem. These are the raphe
nuclei that lie directly along the midline from the midbrain to the medulla (Figure 14.14). 
(The term raphe comes from the French for “seam”). In the rat, these nuclei contain only 
about 20,500 neurons, but their axons innervate wide areas of the brain and extend down 
the spinal cord.141 The raphe neurons fire spontaneously at a slow, steady rate of around 
1–3 Hz, but this rate can be modified by a variety of afferent inputs and is accelerated when 
an animal is awake or aroused and active.142 The raphe neurons have 5-HT receptors and 
are subject to autoinhibition143 by locally released 5-HT through activation of inwardly 
rectifying potassium channels.144,145
There is a remarkable number and variety of 5-HT receptors.146,147 One of these, 
the 5-HT3 receptor, is a ligand-gated cation channel, highly homologous to the nicotinic

receptor148 (so homologous, in fact, that it can actually 
form a functional chimeric channel with the nicotinic 
α4-subunit149). These ionotropic 5-HT receptors are 
widely distributed in the brain, both presynaptically and 
postsynaptically.150 However, only a couple of true synaptic 
currents produced by serotonergic fiber stimulation have 
been reported, so presumably the receptors respond to 
diffusively released 5-HT.
All of the other 5-HT receptors are G protein–coupled, 
differentially activating Go/Gi, Gq, or Gs (see Chapter 
12). These receptors are found both postsynaptically and 
presynaptically, and some neurons express more than one 
type of receptor. Thus, the overall actions of 5-HT on 
individual neurons and synaptic pathways are complex 
and variable, and they cannot readily be extrapolated to

effects on brain function.147,148 The overall actions 
can be more readily deduced from the actions of 
drugs that mimic 5-HT, block its action on specific 
receptors, or block its reuptake, or from the effects 
of individual 5-HT receptor knock-outs.147 For 
example, projections to the hypothalamus help to 
regulate the sleep–wake cycle142 and food intake,151
so that drugs that inhibit 5-HT uptake reduce food 
intake. These same drugs, which include fluoxetine 
(or Prozac), are used as antidepressants, probably 
reflecting a general role for 5-HT in controlling 
affective states.152 A more focused effect of descend-
ing serotonergic fibers is their role in reducing the 
release of transmitters from nociceptive spinal 
and trigeminal sensory afferents in the substantia 
gelatinosa.153,154 Thus, the drug sumatriptan, which 
selectively activates these (5-HT1D) receptors, can 
suppress the symptoms of migraine and trigeminal 
neuralgia. 5-HT also contributes to the expression 
of aggression in a range of animal species, includ-
ing crustacea.155
DOPAMINE Dopamine (3-hydroxytyramine) 
is an intermediary in the synthetic pathway to 
norepinephrine (see Appendix B). However, some 
important groups of neurons do not have the 
enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase that converts 
dopamine to norepinephrine, so dopamine is the end product.156 These dopaminergic
neurons are concentrated in four nuclei in the brainstem (Figure 14.15). One group in the 
arcuate nucleus sends axons to the hypothalamus, where they control prolactin secretion 
from pituitary lactotrophs.157 The other three groups are in the ventral tegmental area and 
substantia nigra (so-called because the neurons contain neuromelanin and stain black). 
Axons from these neurons project to the neostriatum in the basal ganglia, limbic structures 
such as the nucleus accumbens, and the prefrontal cortex. As with other catecholaminergic 
systems, a very few dopaminergic neurons reach out to many target cells—there are about 
7000 neurons in the substantia nigra but each neuron gives rise to an estimated 250,000 
varicosities in the basal ganglia.158
Also, like other catecholamine-releasing neurons, dopaminergic neurons show spontane-
ous firing, the rate and rhythm of which are controlled by afferent inputs.159 The released 
dopamine may act on one or more of five receptors (D1 through D5). Activating D1 or D5
receptors stimulates adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C, while D2,3,4 receptors inhibit 
adenylate cyclase, open potassium channels, and inhibit calcium currents (see Chapter 12). 
Thus, the postsynaptic action of released dopamine varies with different target neurons and 
can be complex.160 Nearly all dopaminergic neurons have autoreceptors, on both their ter-
minals and soma–dendrite regions. These are mostly D2 receptors whose activation inhibits 
neuron firing (if on the soma or dendrites) or inhibits dopamine release (if at the terminals).
The physiological importance of the dopaminergic projection to the basal ganglia became 
apparent when it was discovered that it was much reduced in patients with Parkinson’s 
disease (a disease affecting motor control, see Chapter 24).161 In Parkinson’s disease, there 
is a selective degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, resulting 
in the loss of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. This finding led to one of the most 
astonishing advances in medical treatment, namely, that giving the precursor of dopamine, 
L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), increased the amount of dopamine in the residual 
terminals and dramatically reversed the motor deficits.162,163 
Other dopaminergic projections serve different functions. The projection from the ventral 
tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens is a reward signaling system, with the neurons 
increasing their activity in anticipation of or in response to pleasurable events.103,164 This 
area is the principal site of action of the addictive drug cocaine, which inhibits the dopamine

transporter and increases the amount of dopamine 
released in the nucleus accumbens.165 This effect, and 
the accompanying behavioral response, is abolished 
in transgenic mice in which the normal dopamine 
transporter is replaced with one that is insensitive 
to cocaine.166 As noted previously, another addictive 
drug, nicotine, also increases dopamine release in the 
nucleus accumbens, though by a different mechanism. 
The projection to the prefrontal cortex is thought to 
participate in cognitive functions167 and to control 
affective states such as schizophrenia;168 nearly all 
drugs currently used to treat the latter condition work 
by blocking dopamine receptors. 
HISTAMINE Histamine was first identified as a me-
diator of inflammation. However, when the first anti-
histamines were introduced (in the 1930s, to treat hay 
fever, rashes, and insect bites), their main side effect 
was to make the recipient sleepy. This provided the 
first clue that histamine might also be important in 
the brain—a role that has been amply confirmed.169
There is a dense aggregation of histamine-containing 
neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the dorsal 
hypothalamus (Figure 14.16). From there, histamin-
ergic fibers project to wide areas of the brain, including other parts of the hypothalamus, 
the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia as well as down the spinal 
cord. Histamine also acts as a transmitter in some invertebrates, for example, at arthropod 
photoreceptor synapses.170
There are three subtypes of histamine receptor in the brain, all G protein-coupled: H1, 
H2, and H3. H1 receptors (the original antihistamine receptors) are the principal postsynaptic 
receptors. They activate the G protein Gq to stimulate phospholipase C (see Chapter 12) 
and depolarize neurons by inhibiting potassium currents (including M-currents113) (Figure 
14.17A). H2 receptors are also postsynaptic—their main effect is to inhibit the slow calcium-
activated potassium current and increase action potential discharges171 (Figure 14.17B), 
which they do by activating adenylate cyclase and increasing cyclic AMP. In contrast, H3
receptors act as autoinhibitory receptors.172 They are located on the somata and dendrites 
of the histaminergic neurons, where they reduce their natural firing rate (Figure 14.17C), 
and on their terminals, where they reduce transmitter release.
As might be anticipated from the wide distribution of their efferent fibers, tuberomam-
millary histaminergic neurons affect many brain functions. One notable role is in regulating 
sleep. Their activity is closely coupled to the sleep–wake cycle (Figure 14.18). They are more 
active during the awake state and induce cortical arousal through their direct projections 
to the thalamus and cortex and by activating other ascending arousal systems.173 Blockade 
of the histamine H1 receptors on their target neurons explains the somnolent effect of the 
original antihistamines. A projection to the suprachiasmatic nucleus and to other regions 
also affects the sleep–wake cycle through an alteration in circadian rhythm.174 
Histaminergic neurons also control motor behavior. Mice in which histamine levels 
have been reduced by deleting the synthetic enzyme histidine decarboxylase show exag-
gerated responses to locomotor stimulants;175 and a mutation in the gene encoding this 
enzyme has recently been found in a human family exhibiting Tourette’s syndrome,176 a 
neurological disorder in which the affected person shows uncontrolled jerky spontaneous 
movements and verbal expostulations.
Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)
ATP is an essential transmitter and chemical messenger in the PNS. This discovery stems 
from the pioneering work of Pamela Holton, who first showed that ATP was released from 
peripheral nerve endings when their axons were stimulated,177 and by Geoffrey Burnstock,

who established its transmitter function in the autonomic 
nervous system (see Chapter 17) and dubbed ATP-releasing 
nerves “purinergic.”178 It is now recognized that ATP also 
plays a significant role in intercellular communication within 
the CNS.179 There are two types of receptors for ATP: P2X
receptors, which are ligand-gated cation channels,180 and 
G protein–coupled receptors, called P2Y receptors.181 Seven 
types of P2X receptor subunits and eight different P2Y recep-
tors are known. Many of the P22X receptors and some of the 
P2Y receptors (most widely, the P2Y1 receptor) are expressed 
on neurons and glial cells in the brain.
ATP acts as a fast transmitter on P2X receptors at a few 
synapses in the brain.182,183 At some synapses, it acts as the

Receptors. (A) Record from a cell in the pontine reticular formation. 
Downward deflections are transient voltage responses to brief hyperpolar-
izing constant current injections. Application of histamine (bar) caused de-
polarization and induced action potential firing (truncated by the recorder). 
When the cell was repolarized during the response to histamine, the brief 
current injections produced a larger voltage deflection, showing that the 
membrane conductance was reduced. This finding was attributed to the 
reduction of a resting potassium conductance. (B) Stimulating H2 recep-

tors slows action potential discharges in a tuberomammillary histaminergic 
neuron. These records show the spontaneous activity of a neuron recorded 
when H3 receptors were blocked with the selective H3 antagonist thioper-

sole transmitter184 but more often it is co-released with another transmitter.185 However, the 
wide distribution of P2X receptors in the CNS (including in presynaptic terminals181) suggests 
that most of them respond to diffusely released ATP, like the nicotinic ACh receptors. Their 
principal function may be to deliver a charge of calcium, since these receptors have a high 
conductance for calcium ions.179 ATP (or better, adenosine diphosphate [ADP]) can also 
excite neurons in the hippocampus by stimulating P2Y1 G protein–coupled receptors, which 
induce a depolarizing cation current186 or inhibit the M-current.187
Neuroglial cells also possess ATP receptors, which may be involved in neuron-to-glial cell 
signaling.188 It is envisaged that: (1) ATP released from neurons activates glial cell purinocep-
tors to increase intracellular calcium ion concentration; (2) the increased intraglial calcium 
in turn, releases ATP and other chemical mediators from the glial cells onto the neurons 
to alter their activity; and (3) the ATP so released also activates neighboring glial cells to 
spread the signal.188 Thus, recent research has shown that glial cells can be depolarized by 
ATP that is released from specialized release sites along axons,189 as well as from purinergic 
nerve terminals; that ATP released following nerve injury activates microglial cells and 
causes them to release ATP through pannexin or innexin channels;190 that ATP-mediated 
microglial activation contributes to the long-term regulation of pain transmission in the 
spinal cord;191 and that, in the nucleus tractus solitarius, ATP released from glial cells onto 
neighboring chemosensitive neurons drives the central respiratory response to produce 
changes in arterial blood pH and carbon dioxide tension.192
Extracellular ATP is rapidly dephosphorylated by ecto-nucleotidases to adenosine, 
which joins a pool of adenosine extruded from neurons and glial cells by transporters, 
producing a constant but fluctuating interstitial adenosine concentration of between 25 
and 250 nanomolar (nm).193 Adenosine can activate another family of G protein–coupled 
receptors on neurons called adenosine receptors. Some of these (A1 and A2A receptors) are 
sufficiently sensitive to adenosine to be activated at the normal levels of interstitial adenosine, 
so producing a tonic reduction of neuron excitability and transmitter release.194 This is 
important in the regulation of sleep.195 For example, accumulation of adenosine during 
periods of wakefulness depresses the activity of neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus, 
thus precipitating sleepiness. This explains the stimulant action of caffeine, since caffeine 
blocks adenosine receptors. Thus, mice in which the A2A gene is deleted are unusually ag-
gressive and no longer respond to the stimulant effect of caffeine.196 
Peptides
There are differences between peptide transmitters (or neuropeptides) and small molecule 
transmitters like amino acids and monoamines. First, peptides are not synthesized de novo in 
nerve endings but instead are split off from larger precursor molecules by peptidase enzymes. 
The precursors are made in the cell bodies, transported down the axons to the terminals, and 
then packaged (with their peptidase enzymes) into large secretory (i.e., dense-core) synaptic 
vesicles (see Figure 15.8). Second, they are often present in the same nerve terminals (though 
in different vesicles) that release small-molecule transmitters like the amino acids and so may 
be co-released.24 Third, in the mammalian nervous system at least, the peptides act exclusively 
as indirect transmitters, mainly through G protein–coupled receptors (see Chapter 12), and 
tend to straddle the boundary between transmitter and hormone. The best example of true 
peptidergic transmission is that mediated by a gonadotrophin-like peptide in frog sympa-
thetic ganglia197 (see Figure 17.2); most peptides seem to have a less clearly identifiable, more 
complex effect in the mammalian brain.
Peptides are good immunogens, so antibodies have been used extensively to identify the 
neurons, fiber tracts, and nerve terminals that contain them or their precursor molecules.198
However, peptides do not readily enter the brain and relatively few non-peptide chemicals 
capable of stimulating or blocking their receptors have been discovered, so their specific 
functions at individual synapses are often difficult to determine. As pointed out in Box 
14.2, there are at least 60 neuropeptides in the brain, too many to be discussed individu-
ally. Instead, we have selected for illustration five peptides with different functions: two, 
substance P and the opioid peptides, with a particular (but not exclusive) connection to 
pain perception; the orexins, which regulate feeding and the sleep–wake cycle; and two

Neurotransmitters in the Central Nervous System 293
closely related peptides, vasopressin and oxytocin, which appear to play an interesting role 
in the way in which animals and humans interact with each other. 
Substance P
Substance P is a peptide with 11 amino acids, having the composition Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-
Gln-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met. It is a member of the family of tachykinins. There are two 
other tachykinins in the mammalian CNS, the neurokinins (NKs) A and B, but many more 
in non-mammalian vertebrates and invertebrates.199 Substance P is so called because in 
1931, von Euler and Gaddum first detected its biological activity in a powder made from 
extracts of horse intestine and brain.200 Substance P and other neurokinins act on a group 
of Gq-G protein–coupled receptors called NK receptors. Substance P preferentially targets 
NK1 receptors but can also activate NK2 and NK3 receptors at high concentrations.
Substance P is highly concentrated in primary afferent pain-sensing neurons and their 
unmyelinated axons, and in the central endings of these neurons in the substantia gelatinosa 
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.201 When primary afferent fibers are stimulated, sub-
stance P (along with glutamate) is co-released as a neurotransmitter and then depolarizes 
the target dorsal horn neurons.202 Its role in nociceptive (pain) transmission has been 
examined using NK1 receptor antagonists and mice in which the NK1 receptor has been 
genetically deleted (NK1 knock-outs). It is not involved in the transmission of acutely painful 
stimuli, such as a tail-pinch or burn, but NK1 knock-out mice showed a reduced response 
to the prolonged pain produced by injecting a painful inflammatory substance.203,204 The 
gradual increase in the firing of dorsal horn neurons during repeated C-fiber stimulation 
(termed “wind-up”) that is associated with sensitization to painful stimuli was also strongly 
reduced in these animals.205 Rather disappointingly, however, NK1 antagonist drugs seem 
not to have any significant effects on inflammatory pain in humans.206 Substance P is also 
strongly expressed in some supraspinal regions, such as the substantia nigra.203 It may be 
involved in the control of affective states, since mice in which the NK1 receptor gene has 
been deleted show behavioral changes similar to mice treated with antidepressant drugs.207
Opioid Peptides
Opioid peptides are a family of endogenous neuropeptides that interact with opioid re-
ceptors (as do exogenous substances such as morphine). They include the pentapeptides 
leu-enkephalin and met-enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu and Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met), 
which were originally discovered by Hughes, Kosterlitz, and their colleagues (see Box 
14.2), plus a number of larger peptides containing the enkephalin sequences, such as the 
α-endorphins, β-endorphins, and the dynorphins (dynorphin A and B, neo-dynorphin).208
They are formed by peptidase cleavage from three large precursor proteins (Figure 14.19) 
and stimulate one or more of three opioid receptors labeled μ, δ, and κ (sometimes called 
MOR, DOR, and KOR for mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptor). These are G protein–
coupled receptors that activate the pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, Go and Gi. Like 
others of this type of receptor, they inhibit calcium channels to reduce transmitter release, 
activate inwardly rectifying potassium channels to hyperpolarize neuron, and inhibit ad-
enylate cyclase (see Chapter 12).

Opioid peptides are closely involved in the control of pain. Thus, they are strongly 
expressed in the periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain and in the dorsal horn of the 
spinal cord.209,210 At the latter site, enkephalin-containing fibers innervate nociceptive dorsal 
horn neurons211 and inhibit them by activating an inwardly rectifying potassium current.212 
Enkephalin released from descending fibers in the brainstem or from spinal interneurons also 
inhibits the release of substance P from nociceptive afferent fibers.213 This probably results 
from the inhibition of the calcium current required for transmitter release from afferent 
nerve endings, as is indicated by the experiments on sensory neurons depicted in Figure 
14.20.214 Opioid receptor antagonists and genetic deletion of the opioid receptors215 both 
induce hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain), demonstrating that the opioid peptides 
play a physiological role in controlling pain. However, these peptides and their receptors are 
also widely expressed in other parts of the brain not directly concerned with pain, such as the 
basal ganglia and subcortical limbic areas,216 suggesting their involvement in other functions.
Another interesting opioid peptide has the dual name orphanin FQ and nociceptin.217,218
This is because orphanin was identified as the previously unknown ligand for an orphan
receptor called NOP (formerly called ORL1), hence orphanin,219 and nociceptin because 
it increased the response to painful stimuli in animals.220 The “FQ” is added to orphanin 
because it is identical to dynorphin A (see Figure 14.9) except for two amino acid substi-
tutions: phenylalanine (F) and glutamine (Q). The NOP receptor is homologous to the 
opioid receptors, couples to their same G proteins, and has the same effects on neurons 
when stimulated as do opioid receptors.219 The reason it increases pain, rather than reduc-
ing it like other opioids, is probably because the NOP receptors are located on different 
neurons than those with enkephalin or dynorphin receptors. It has been suggested that the 
NOP neurons normally reduce activity in pain pathways, so that when they are inhibited 
by nociceptin/orphanin FQ transmission, the pain pathway is enhanced (disinhibited). 
Nociceptin/orphanin FQ and its receptors are also expressed widely throughout the brain, 
so this peptide has effects on the brain that are unrelated to pain.216,217
Orexins (Hypocretins)
Orexins are hypothalamic peptides that regulate sleep and feeding by promoting awakening 
and enhancing appetite221,222 (see Box 14.2 for an account of their discovery). There are 
two orexins, A and B, which are both generated from the same precursor protein. They act 
on two G protein–coupled receptors, OX1 and OX2, which mainly activate the G protein

dorsal horn block transmission partly by inhibit-
ing transmitter release from terminals of the DRG 
cells. (C) Intracellular recordings from the dorsal 
root ganglion cell demonstrate that enkephalin acts 
by causing a decrease in the duration of the action 
potential, reflecting reduced calcium current, which 
would reduce the amount of transmitter released 
from sensory nerve terminals. (C after Mudge,

Neurotransmitters in the Central Nervous System 295
Gq and, when stimulated, increase the activity of the target neuron. Orexin-containing 
neurons are localized to the posterior lateral hypothalamus, but their axons innervate large 
areas of the brain (Figure 14.21).
The role of orexins in regulating sleep was established by two genetic observations. First, 
mice in which the DNA sequences encoding the orexins had been deleted showed exces-
sive nighttime sleeping.223 (Mice are nocturnal so this is equivalent to daytime sleeping in 
humans.) The second clue came from work on dogs with the sleep disorder narcolepsy—a 
disorder that also quite commonly affects people (about 1 in 2000 in the United States). The 
victim suffers from repeated periods of extreme daytime sleepiness, suddenly falling asleep 
at the most inconvenient times (sleep attacks); in extreme cases, these episodes are coupled 
with loss of muscle tone, so that the person collapses (cataplexy). It was found that dogs that 
had this disease (Doberman pinschers and Labradors) had specific mutations in the gene 
encoding the OX2 orexin receptor.224 Human narcolepsy patients do not necessarily have this 
mutation but instead lose orexin-containing neurons so they do not secrete enough orexin.222
Orexin neurons induce awakening via pathways to the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, and 
tuberomammillary nuclei, activating noradrenergic, serotonergic, and histaminergic neurons, 
respectively (Figure 14.22). Stimulation of histaminergic neurons could play a role because 
the awakening effect of orexin injected into the lateral ventricles of mice is abolished when the

histamine H1-receptor gene is deleted.225 In turn, the orexinergic neurons receive information 
about the state of the sleep–wake cycle from the suprachiasmatic nucleus.
Orexinergic neurons also act as sensors of nutritional state and respond to changes in 
extracellular glucose levels. As shown in Figure.14.23, orexinergic neurons are spontaneously 
active when the concentration of glucose in the extracellular medium is low (0.2 mM in this 
experiment). However, increasing the glucose concentration progressively silences the neurons, 
by activating twin-pore potassium channels and hyperpolarizing them.226 Orexinergic neurons 
are also inhibited by the hormone leptin (secreted by adipocytes, or fat cells, in proportion to 
the amount of fat they contain; see also Chapter 17) but are activated by another hormone, 
ghrelin (secreted from the stomach and pancreas as a hunger signal) (see Figure 14.22). Hence, 
the orexinergic neurons signal low glucose and hunger, which leads to increased food intake, 
partly through activation of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY)-secreting neurons but 
mainly by triggering orexin’s awakening action. In other words, you have to be awake to eat, 
and hunger wakes you up. Hence, orexin-containing neurons help to coordinate the brain’s 
response to information about the body’s nutritional and sleep–wake balance.
Vasopressin and Oxytocin: The Social Brain
These two peptides are contained in neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei 
of the hypothalamus. They are secreted into the bloodstream from nerve endings in the 
posterior pituitary gland. Vasopressin promotes water reabsorption from the kidney (it was 
originally called antidiuretic hormone); oxytocin induces lactation. However, processes 
of these neurons innervate other parts of the brain (Figure 14.24); thus, the peptides can 
excite many central neurons.227
Both peptides strongly influence the social behavior of animals and humans via direct or 
indirect connections to the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. Some of the 
key observations leading to this conclusion came from experiments on voles.228 Some voles, 
such as the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) are monogamous: the male forms a strong pair 
bond with the female, cooperates in rearing the pups, and aggressively repels a strange prairie 
vole. Other related vole species, such as the meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus) or the montane 
vole (M. montanus), are more promiscuous and do not form tight pair bonds. It was found 
that this behavioral difference was critically dependent on the expression and distribution 
of the vasopressin V1A receptor in the male.229 Thus, intracerebroventricular injection of a 
V1A receptor antagonist in the normally monogamous male prairie vole increased aggression, 
disrupted male–female pair bonding, and increased extra-pair bonding,230 while overexpres-

sion of the V1A receptor gene AVPR1A dramatically increased pair bonding in the more 
promiscuous meadow vole.228 Differences in V1A receptor expression in the two species are 
related to the presence of a long insert in the noncoding region of the AVPR1A gene in the 
meadow vole.231 Interestingly, the human gene shows polymorphisms in this region, which 
have been correlated with the strength of pair bonding in human males.232 
Oxytocin has the complementary effect of strengthening pair bonding in female voles. 
Thus, oxytocin release in the nucleus accumbens is greatly increased after mating, while infu-
sion of oxytocin facilitates pair bonding and blocking oxytocin receptors hinders it.229 Pair 
bonding and maternal–pup bonding is also reduced in mice in which the oxytocin receptor 
or the enzyme CD38 (which facilitates oxytocin release) are disrupted.233 Facilitation of pair 
bonding involves a suppression of the normal fear response mediated by the amygdala, which 
is where the olfactory recognition signal required for social interaction is processed (see Figure 
14.24). In humans, this effect translates to an increase in trust and empathy,234,235 essential 
prerequisites for interpersonal bonding. Indeed, oxytocin and vasopressin may provide the 
long-sought chemical basis for at least part of that human emotion termed love.236,237

SUMMARY
 
■
There is a wide variety of chemical transmitters in the 
CNS. Neurons that use a particular transmitter can be 
identified by immunohistochemical and other visual 
methods.
 
■
Many neurons release more than one transmitter, and 
each transmitter can act on a variety of target receptors. 
Hence, their postsynaptic effects on individual neurons 
are often complex.
 
■
The main excitatory transmitter is glutamate. This acts 
on two types of ionotropic receptor (AMPA and NMDA 
receptors) to generate excitatory postsynaptic potentials. 
It also acts on a metabotropic receptor, mGluR, to 
produce pre-and postsynaptic modulatory effects.
 
■
GABA and glycine are inhibitory transmitters in the 
brain and spinal cord. Glycine acts on ionotropic 
receptors. GABA acts on both ionotropic (GABAA) and 
metabotropic (GABAB) receptors.
 
■
Cholinergic neurons are concentrated in the basal 
forebrain. Their axons innervate wide areas of the 
cerebral cortex and many subcortical regions. They play 
a role in cortical arousal, attention, and memory. ACh 
released from these nerves acts on ionotropic nicotinic 
receptors, which are mainly located on presynaptic 
nerve endings, and on metabotropic muscarinic 
receptors.
 
■
The monoamines norepinephrine, 5-HT, dopamine, 
and histamine are contained in a relatively few 
neurons clustered in discrete nuclei in the brainstem 
and midbrain. Axons of noradrenergic, serotonergic, 
and histaminergic neurons project to wide areas of 
the forebrain and affect numerous brain functions. 
Dopaminergic axons project to the basal ganglia and 
limbic system, and play a specific role in the control of 
motor function
 
■
ATP is released as a cotransmitter from many neurons. 
It acts on ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y 
receptors on both neurons and neuroglial cells.
 
■
A number of different neuropeptides are released from 
central neurons. Examples described are: substance 
P and the enkephalins, which control pain; orexin, 
which affects sleep and feeding; and oxytocin and 
vasopressin, which affect social behavior.

■ CHAPTER 15
Transmitter Synthesis, 
Transport, Storage, 
and Inactivation
       t chemical synapses, neurons release neuropeptides as well as low-molecular-weight 
         transmitters. Low-molecular-weight transmitters, such as acetylcholine (ACh), 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate, are synthesized in the axon terminal. 
A number of mechanisms ensure that their supply is adequate to meet the demands of release; 
these include storage of transmitters in synaptic vesicles, rapid changes in the activity of 
enzymes mediating transmitter synthesis, and long-term changes in the number of enzyme 
molecules in the terminal. Neuropeptides are synthesized and incorporated into vesicles in the 
cell body, then shipped down the axon for storage and release. More than one neurotransmitter 
may be stored in and released from the same nerve terminal.
Synaptic vesicles and other organelles move by fast axonal transport toward the terminal 
(anterograde transport) and back to the cell body (retrograde transport). Slow axonal transport 
moves cytoplasmic proteins and components of the axonal cytoskeleton from the cell body 
toward the terminal.
The final step in chemical synaptic transmission is removal of the transmitter from the syn-
aptic cleft. Low-molecular-weight transmitters are either degraded after release or taken up into 
glial cells or axon terminals where they are repackaged into vesicles and released again. Neuro-
peptides are removed by diffusion. Drugs that interfere with transmitter degradation or uptake can 
have profound effects on signaling, indicating that such removal processes play an important role 
in synaptic function.
A

300 Chapter 15
Chapters 11, 12, and 14 have shown that there are many different chemical neurotransmit-
ters. Some are small molecules (less than 1 kilodalton in mass); these include acetylcholine, 
the amino acids glutamate and GABA, and several monoamines (norepinephrine [NE], 
dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT] and histamine). Others peptides can be several 
kilodaltons in size. In this chapter, we consider how some of the key transmitters are made 
(or synthesized); how they are stored in the nerve endings; how they (or their synthetic 
enzymes) get to the nerve ending (by axoplasmic flow); and how, after their release, the 
transmitters are degraded or their postsynaptic action is otherwise terminated (Figure 
15.1). Mechanisms of release are described in Chapter 13.
Neurotransmitter Synthesis
Where are transmitter molecules synthesized, and how are transmitter stores maintained 
and replenished? Are transmitters shipped ready-made to the nerve terminals, or are they 
assembled there from precursors provided by the cell body? The answers to such questions 
are different for different transmitters. Classical low-molecular-weight transmitters are pro-
duced within the axon terminal from common cellular metabolites and are incorporated 
into small synaptic vesicles (50 nanometers [nm] in diameter) for storage and release. Nitric 
oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and the endocannabinoids are also synthesized within 
terminals. However, since they cannot be packaged in vesicles, they immediately diffuse 
out of nerve terminals to act on their targets (see Chapter 12). Neuropeptide transmitters, 
on the other hand, are synthesized in the cell body, packaged in large dense-core vesicles 
(100–200 nm in diameter), and shipped down the axon.
Principal biochemical pathways for the synthesis and degradation of acetylcholine, 
GABA, glutamate, catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine), and 
histamine are shown in Appendix B.
Synthesis of ACh
Birks and MacIntosh performed one of the first thorough investigations into how trans-
mitters are accumulated in nerve terminals and how transmitter stores are maintained 
during periods of activity in their studies on ACh in the terminals of preganglionic axons 
in the superior cervical ganglion of the cat (Figure 15.2A,B; see also Chapter 17).1 They 
cannulated the carotid artery and the jugular vein, perfused the ganglion with solutions 
containing anticholinesterase, and analyzed the perfusate for ACh. A small amount of ACh 
was continually released from the ganglion at rest, amounting to 0.1% of the total contents 
each minute (Figure 15.2C). The fact that the level of ACh in the ganglion remained con-
stant meant that ACh was synthesized continually at rest. Subsequently it was shown that 
the ongoing rate of synthesis of ACh at rest, determined by monitoring the incorporation 
of radioactively labeled choline into ACh, is so high that an amount equal to the entire 
store of ACh is degraded and resynthesized within the axon terminals every 20 minutes.2
Birks and MacIntosh then stimulated the preganglionic nerve with long trains of impulses 
and found that the quantity of ACh released from the ganglion increased 100-fold, so that 
an amount corresponding to 10% of the original content was released each minute (see 
Figure 15.2C). Remarkably, this rate of release was maintained for over an hour with no

FIGURE 15.1 Chemical Synaptic Transmission. At chemical 
synapses, neurotransmitters are synthesized, stored in synaptic

the synaptic cleft, activate receptors on the postsynaptic cell, 
and then are removed by diffusion, uptake, or degradation.

Transmitter Synthesis, Transport, Storage, and Inactivation 301
change in the level of ACh in the ganglion. Thus, during an hour of stimulation an axon 
terminal can release an amount of ACh equal to many times its original content without 
having its stores depleted.
The only exogenous ingredient the nerve terminals need to maintain their stores of 
ACh under such conditions is choline, which is taken up from the surrounding fluid via 
an active transport process (Figure 15.3). The requirement for extracellular choline was 
demonstrated both by perfusing the preparation with solutions lacking choline and by 
blocking choline uptake into the axon terminals with hemicholinium (HC-3). In both 
cases, the level of ACh in the ganglion and the amount released by stimulation fell rapidly 
(see Figure 15.2C).
How is ACh synthesis controlled to meet the demands of release? Our understanding 
of the mechanisms regulating ACh synthesis and storage in cholinergic nerve terminals is 
surprisingly limited. The enzymatic reactions are summarized in Figure 15.3 and shown 
in detail in Appendix B. Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A 
(acetyl-CoA) by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and is hydrolyzed to choline 
and acetate by acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Both enzymes are found in the cytosol. Because 
the reaction catalyzed by ChAT is reversible, one factor controlling the level of ACh is the 
law of mass action. For example, a fall in ACh concentration caused by release would favor 
net synthesis until equilibrium was reestablished. However, the regulatory mechanisms at 
work within cholinergic axon terminals are more complex than this. For example, under 
resting conditions the accumulation of ACh is limited by ongoing hydrolysis by intracel-
lular acetylcholinesterase; inhibition of AChE within nerve terminals causes the ACh 
content to increase.1,2 Thus, the level to which ACh accumulates represents a steady state 
between ongoing synthesis and degradation. This is a common feature of the metabolism 
of low-molecular-weight transmitters. Although it seems wasteful, such constant turnover 
may be an unavoidable consequence of the mechanisms that ensure an adequate supply of 
transmitter is always available.
Much of the ACh in nerve terminals is sequestered in synaptic vesicles, whereas ACh 
synthesis and degradation occur in the cytosol. Thus, to have an effect on the rate of synthesis, 
the release of ACh must reduce the cytoplasmic concentration of ACh, which presumably

occurs from the movement of cytoplasmic ACh into newly formed vesicles. Similar interplay 
between cytoplasmic synthesis and vesicular storage and release is a common feature of the 
metabolism of low-molecular-weight transmitters. Maintaining the correct balance between 
ACh synthesis and vesicular uptake is facilitated by the fact that the gene for the vesicular 
transporter VAChT is contained in the first intron of the gene for the synthetic enzyme 
ChAT3 so that the entire gene forms a cholinergic neuron gene.4 This process ensures a 
coordinated expression of the two proteins for synthesis and vesicular uptake through a 
common gene promoter.5 In cholinergic nerve terminals in the central nervous system, the 
supply of choline and co-substrate acetyl-CoA (made in mitochondria) and the activity of 
ChAT have also been shown to regulate the rate of ACh synthesis.6,7
Synthesis of Dopamine and Norepinephrine
Another mechanism by which the rate of synthesis of substances in cells is controlled is 
feedback inhibition, in which the rate-limiting step in a biosynthetic pathway is inhibited by 
the final product. A good example comes from studies by von Euler, Axelrod, Udenfriend, 
and their colleagues on the synthesis, storage, and release of norepinephrine in sympathetic 
neurons and in secretory cells of the adrenal medulla.8 Adrenal medullary cells resemble 
sympathetic neurons in many ways. They share the same embryonic origin, are innervated 
by cholinergic axons that originate in the central nervous system, and release a catechol-
amine in response to stimulation. The term catecholamine is used to designate collectively 
the substances 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), dopamine, norepinephrine, and epi-
nephrine—all of which contain a catechol nucleus (i.e., a benzene ring with two adjacent 
hydroxyl groups) and an amino group (see Appendix B.) Mammalian sympathetic neurons 
release norepinephrine (those in frog release epinephrine); adrenal medullary cells release 
epinephrine as well as norepinephrine.
Norepinephrine is synthesized from the common cellular metabolite tyrosine in a series 
of three steps. First, tyrosine is converted to DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, 
then DOPA to dopamine by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), and finally 
dopamine to norepinephrine by dopamine β-hydroxylase (Figure 15.4; see also Appendix 
B). The conversions of tyrosine to DOPA and DOPA to dopamine occur in the cytoplasm.

FIGURE 15.3 Pathways of Acetylcholine Synthesis, 
Storage, Release, and Degradation. Acetylcholine (ACh) 
is synthesized from choline and acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) 
by choline acetyltransferase (CAT) and is degraded by ace-
tylcholinesterase (AChE). AcCoA is synthesized primarily in 
mitochondria; choline is supplied by a high-affinity active trans-
port system that can be inhibited by hemicholinium (HC-3). 
ACh is packaged into vesicles together with ATP for release 
by exocytosis. Transport of ACh into vesicles is blocked by 
vesamicol. Vesicular ACh is protected from degradation. After 
release, ACh is degraded by extracellular AChE to choline and 
acetate. About half of the choline transported into choliner-
gic axon terminals comes from the hydrolysis of ACh that 
has been released. At some synapses, ATP combines with 
postsynaptic receptors. ATP is hydrolyzed by extracellular 
ATPases to adenosine and phosphate (Pi); adenosine can 
combine with presynaptic receptors to modulate release (see 
Chapter 14).

Transmitter Synthesis, Transport, Storage, and Inactivation 303
Dopamine is then transported into synaptic vesicles, where it is converted to norepineph-
rine by dopamine β-hydroxylase, which is associated with the vesicle membrane. Much of 
the norepinephrine is stored within vesicles; some escapes into the cytoplasm, where it is 
susceptible to degradation by monoamine oxidase.
Neurons that release dopamine as a transmitter contain tyrosine hydroxylase and AAAD 
but they lack dopamine β-hydroxylase. Other neurons, as well as adrenal medullary cells, 
release epinephrine, which is derived from norepinephrine by the action of phenyletha-
nolamine N-methyltransferase.
Typically the first enzyme in a multiple-step pathway is rate limiting and is inhibited 
by the final product. In extracts of the adrenal medulla, the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase 
was found to be two orders of magnitude lower than that of an AAAD and dopamine 
β-hydroxylase, suggesting that tyrosine hydroxylation was the rate-limiting step. Moreover, 
tyrosine hydroxylase was shown to be inhibited by norepinephrine (and by dopamine and 
epinephrine as well). Thus, as dopamine, norepinephrine, or epinephrine accumulates, 
further synthesis will be inhibited until a steady state is reached, at which point the rate of 
synthesis is equal to the rate of degradation and release (see Figure 15.4).
Evidence that feedback inhibition regulates the synthesis of norepinephrine in neurons 
came from experiments by Weiner and his colleagues on terminals of sympathetic axons

innervating the smooth muscles of a duct called the vas deferens.9 They measured the rate 
of norepinephrine synthesis in the terminals by bathing the preparation in radioactively 
labeled precursors and monitoring the accumulation of radioactively labeled norepinephrine. 
They found that the rate of norepinephrine synthesis was more than threefold greater if the 
first enzymatic step was bypassed by providing DOPA rather than tyrosine as the precursor, 
confirming that the conversion of tyrosine to DOPA was rate limiting.
To test the idea that the rate-limiting step was controlled by feedback inhibition, they 
varied the concentration of norepinephrine in the cytoplasm in two ways. First, taking 
advantage of the fact that sympathetic axon terminals have a specific transport mechanism 
for NE, they added NE to the bathing fluid, which caused an increase in NE concentration 
in the terminals and decreased the rate at which norepinephrine was synthesized from 
tyrosine. Conversely, nerve stimulation, which lowers the concentration of NE in the 
cytoplasm, increased the rate of conversion of tyrosine to NE almost twofold. No such 
increase was seen, however, if NE was added to the bath during nerve stimulation. Appar-
ently, uptake from the medium was sufficient to maintain the level of norepinephrine in 
the axon terminals and so limit its biosynthesis.
Additional factors affect catecholamine synthesis (Figure 15.5). When axon terminals 
are stimulated to release norepinephrine, tyrosine hydroxylase acquires a higher affinity for 
its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (see Appendix B) and becomes less sensitive to inhibition 
by NE.10 These changes are associated with a reversible phosphorylation of the enzyme 
by kinases activated by the influx of calcium ions.11,12 An additional factor that regulates 
tyrosine hydroxylase activity is the concentration of tetrahydrobiopterin, which is synthesized 
from guanosine triphosphate.13 Thus, a variety of mechanisms act to ensure that the rate 
of synthesis of norepinephrine meets the demands of release.
Synthesis of 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)
Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan. The first step, conversion of tryptophan to 
5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, is rate limiting (see 
Appendix B).14 5-HTP is decarboxylated to serotonin (also called 5-HT) by AAAD, the 
same enzyme that converts DOPA to dopamine. Stimulation of neurons releasing 5-HT 
causes an increase in the rate of conversion of tryptophan to 5-HT. It has been suggested 
that this is due to changes in the properties of tryptophan hydroxylase caused by calcium-
dependent phosphorylation,15 similar to the effects of stimulation on tyrosine hydroxylase. 
Like tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase requires the cofactor tetrahydrobiop-
terin, and serotonin synthesis is thought to be regulated by the availability of this cofactor.
Neurons cannot synthesize tryptophan. Thus, the initial event leading to 5-HT synthesis 
is the facilitated transport of tryptophan from blood into cerebrospinal fluid (see Chapter 8). 
Other neutral amino acids (phenylalanine, leucine, and methionine) are transported from 
the blood into the brain by the same carrier. Thus, an important determinant of the level 
of 5-HT in serotonergic neurons is the relative amount of tryptophan compared to other 
neutral amino acids in the diet. As a result, behaviors associated with 5-HT function (see 
Chapter 14) are particularly sensitive to dietary influences.16 For example, volunteers fed 
a low-protein diet for a day and then given a tryptophan-free amino acid mixture showed 
an increase in aggressive behavior17 and changes in sleep cycle.18

Synthesis of GABA
GABA is synthesized from glutamate by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). 
This reaction was first characterized as part of the so-called GABA shunt—a series of reac-
tions by which α-ketoglutarate could be converted to succinate (Figure 15.6). The GABA 
shunt was originally considered to be a brain-specific pathway for glucose metabolism that 
bypassed part of the Krebs cycle (hence the term “shunt”). The discovery that GABA is 
the major inhibitory transmitter in the brain, together with the finding that glutamic acid 
decarboxylase is found only in neurons releasing GABA (see Chapter 14), suggests that the 
GABA shunt is not of general importance in glucose metabolism.
Kravitz and his colleagues showed that in crustacean inhibitory neurons, physiological 
levels of GABA inhibit glutamic acid decarboxylase, indicating that feedback inhibition 
regulates the accumulation of GABA.19 Several additional regulators of GABA synthesis have 
been identified in the mammalian brain, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), inorganic 
phosphate, and the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate.20 Two forms of glutamic acid decarboxylase 
(GAD67 and GAD65) are present in brain.21,22 GAD67 has a high affinity for pyridoxal phos-
phate and so may be constitutively active. GAD65 has a lower affinity, and its activity may be 
rapidly regulated by cofactor availability. Mutant mice lacking GAD65 have normal behavior 
and levels of GABA but are slightly more susceptible to seizures. GAD67 knockout mice show 
a substantial reduction in brain GABA and die shortly after birth from severe cleft palate.23
Synthesis of Glutamate
Glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter in the brain. There is more than one pathway 
for glutamate synthesis in cells. In neurons, glutamate destined for release as a transmitter 
is derived primarily from glutamine by a phosphate-activated form of the enzyme gluta-
minase24 (Figure 15.7). Much of the glutamate released by neurons is taken up by glial cells 
and converted to glutamine. Glutamine, in turn, is released from the glial cells, taken up 
by neurons, and converted back to glutamate.25–27
Short- and Long-Term Regulation of Transmitter Synthesis
The regulatory mechanisms described so far operate rapidly to change the rate of synthesis 
within nerve terminals. In addition to such short-term effects, there are long-term regula-
tory mechanisms. A good example comes from the response of the sympathetic nervous 
system to prolonged exposure of an animal to stress. When the body is stressed, sympathetic 
neurons are activated. With prolonged activation, the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and 
dopamine β-hydroxylase in the cell bodies and terminals of sympathetic neurons increase 
as much as three- to fourfold.28,29 The increase is due to the synthesis of new enzyme mol-
ecules. Other enzymes of norepinephrine synthesis and degradation, such as AAAD and 
monoamine oxidase, are not affected.
The increase is triggered by synaptic activation of sympathetic neurons (see Figure 15.5). 
Such trans-synaptic regulation provides a mechanism whereby the synthetic capability of 
the neurons can be matched to the rate of transmitter release.30 Experiments on human 
sympathetic ganglia have demonstrated that electrical stimulation of preganglionic fibers 
induces a marked increase in the level of the mRNAs for tyrosine hydroxylase and dopa-

mine β-hydroxylase within 20 minutes, suggesting that the regulation of genes involved in 
norepinephrine synthesis is very rapid and sensitive.31
Synthesis of Neuropeptides
Regulation of the stores of peptide transmitters is complicated by the separation between 
the sites of synthesis and release. Peptides are synthesized on ribosomes, which are found 
predominantly (but not exclusively 32) in neuronal cell bodies. This arrangement has two 
consequences. First, the rate of synthesis of peptides is regulated in the cell body, and the 
peptides must then be moved to the terminal by axonal transport (which will be discussed 
in the next section). This is a slow process compared to the rapid local control of the synthe-
sis and storage of low-molecular-weight transmitters within the axon terminal. Second, the 
amount of a peptide available for release is limited to the amount on hand in the terminal. 
However, the binding of peptides to their receptors occurs at a much lower concentration (in 
the range of 10–10 to 10–8 M) than the binding of low-molecular-weight transmitters, such 
as ACh, to their receptors (10–7 to 10–4 M). In addition, the mechanisms by which they are 
removed from the synaptic cleft are generally slower. Moreover, neuropeptide receptors, like 
other metabotropic receptors, act indirectly through intracellular pathways that can provide 
great amplification (see Chapter 12). As a consequence, only a few molecules of a peptide 
are needed to influence a postsynaptic target, so the demands of release can be met by the 
supply of molecules transported from the cell body.
Peptides are synthesized as part of larger precursor proteins, which often contain the 
sequences for more than one biologically active peptide33 (Figure 15.8). The initial steps 
in neuropeptide precursor synthesis are those typical of secreted proteins: synthesis in 
the endoplasmic reticulum, signal peptide cleavage, processing in the Golgi apparatus, 
and incorporation into large (100–200 nm) dense-core vesicles. Later steps are unique to 
neurons and endocrine cells. They are catalyzed sequentially by: (1) specific endoproteases 
that cleave the precursor protein into the appropriate peptide molecules; (2) exopeptidases, 
which remove C-terminal basic residues; and (3) a bifunctional, amidating enzyme that 
converts the C-terminal peptidyl glycine to the corresponding peptide amide34,35 (see Figure 
15.8B). Proteolytic processing begins in the trans-Golgi network and continues within large 
dense-core vesicles as they are transported down the axon and stored in the terminal. Some 
cells synthesize more than one transmitter peptide; these can be differentially sorted into 
vesicles and targeted to different terminals.36

Glutamate is synthesized from glutamine within mitochondria 
by a phosphate-dependent form of the enzyme glutamin-
ase. An inorganic phosphate (PO4) transporter is localized 
to glutamatergic terminals. After release, some glutamate is 
taken up into presynaptic terminals; most is taken up by glial 
cells and converted to glutamine, which is then released and 
taken up into nerve terminals for conversion to glutamate.

Storage of Transmitters in Synaptic Vesicles
Low-molecular-weight transmitters, such as ACh and NE, are synthesized and packaged 
into vesicles in the axon terminal. In electron micrographs, such synaptic vesicles tend to be 
small (50 nm in diameter) and can appear clear (e.g., ACh, amino acid transmitters) or have 
dense cores (e.g., biogenic amines). The concentration of low-molecular-weight transmitters 
in vesicles is approximately 0.5 M—much greater than that in the surrounding cytoplasm.
The accumulation of transmitters in synaptic vesicles is mediated by specific transport 
proteins. They are members of a large superfamily of solute carrier (SLC) transporters37 and 
are described in Chapter 9 (see Figure 9.5 and Table 9.1). An important point to note is that 
there are fewer types of vesicular transporters than there are neurotransmitters, so some 
SLCs transport more than one transmitter. Thus, while there are individual vesicular ACh 
transporters (VAChTs) and three vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and 
VGLUT3), there is only one vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT) for both 
of the two inhibitory transmitters GABA and glycine and only one vesicular monoamine 
transporter (VMAT, with two variants VMAT1 and 2) for all of the monoamines (i.e., norepi-
nephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and histamine). A vesicular transporter for ATP has recently 
been identified, the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT, from the SLC17A gene family), 
which also transports adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP).38
This poor substrate specificity has some interesting consequences. Thus, it means that some 
vesicles can store and release more than one transmitter. For example, GABA and glycine are

(Gly), the enzyme peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase 
(PAM) converts the carboxy terminus to an amide. (C) Neuro-
peptide precursors are directed into the lumen of the endo-
plasmic reticulum by a signal sequence. In the endoplasmic 
reticulum, disulfide bonds are formed and N-linked glycosyl-
ation occurs. The propeptide is then transported through the 
Golgi apparatus, where further modifications, such as sulfation 
and phosphorylation, take place. Two packaging schemes are 
illustrated. On the left, a propeptide is packaged into vesicles 
budding from the Golgi; as the vesicle matures, the propeptide 
is cleaved, resulting in two peptides (X and Y) packaged in the 
same vesicle. On the right, a propeptide is cleaved within the 
Golgi, followed by sorting of peptides into separate vesicles.

both substrates for the inhibitory amino acid transporter VIAAT. Jonas and his colleagues39
found that GABA and glycine are both released from the same vesicles in the presynaptic 
boutons of spinal interneurons. This co-release could be detected because they activate separate 
postsynaptic GABA and glycine receptors, which can be distinguished pharmacologically. 
The miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, which result from transmitter release from 
a single vesicle, contained components resulting from activation of both of these receptors.
Another consequence is that the wrong transmitter can be taken up by the vesicles and 
then be released as a “false transmitter” instead of the natural transmitter. This property 
can be useful. For example, the drug α-methyldihydroxyphenylalanine (α-methyl DOPA), 
which was once used to reduce blood pressure, is taken up into adrenergic nerve terminals 
and converted to α-methylnorepinephrine through the normal NE biosynthetic pathway 
(see Figure 15.4); it is then taken up into the synaptic vesicles on the monoamine trans-
porter (displacing norepinephrine) and can subsequently be released from the adrenergic 
terminals instead of norepinephrine.40 Since α-methylnorepinephrine is less effective than 
norepinephrine in stimulating the postjunctional adrenergic receptors, α-methyl DOPA 
inhibits noradrenergic transmission and reduces blood pressure. The broad specificity of 
the monoamine transporters also means that the monoamine transmitters are potentially 
capable of replacing each other. Thus, when 5-HT levels in the brain are increased, serotonin 
can be taken up into the synaptic vesicles of dopaminergic neuron terminals in the striatum 
and subsequently released from these terminals.41
A further point to note is that vesicular uptake mechanisms may not be saturated. This 
means that the concentration of transmitter in the vesicles (and hence the quantum of trans-
mitter released) is not necessarily constant but may vary in a manner dependent on a number 
of factors including the availability of the transmitter, the proton gradient driving uptake (see 
Chapter 9), and the intracellular chloride concentration.42,43 Thus, by patching onto the large 
presynaptic terminals of the calyx of Held, Takahashi and his colleagues found that the quantal 
size measured from the miniature postsynaptic currents varied with the amount of glutamate 
(between 1 and 100 mM) in the patching pipette.44 The activity of VGLUT is regulated by 
the concentration of chloride ions in the terminals, which binds to an allosteric site on the 
transporter protein; this chloride effect is inhibited by some products of metabolism, such as 
ketone bodies, with a consequent reduction in hippocampal miniature synaptic currents.45
The reduction in glutamatergic transmission was suggested to explain the antiepileptic effect 
of a ketogenic diet, which is high in fat and low in protein and carbohydrate.
Co-Storage and Co-Release
Following a suggestion by Sir Henry Dale,46 neurons are customarily characterized by the 
transmitter they release—for example, cholinergic neurons (releasing ACh), adrenergic 
neurons (releasing norepinephrine or epinephrine), glutamatergic (releasing glutamate), 
and so on. However, it is now clear that many neurons (perhaps the majority) can release 
more than one transmitter: this effect has been dubbed “cotransmission.”47 In some cases 
cotransmission occurs because two transmitters are stored in the same vesicle—for example, 
the co-release of co-stored glycine and GABA39 described above. Another example is ATP, 
which is frequently co-stored with catecholamines or ACh in synaptic vesicles and released 
as a cotransmitter.48,49 Alternatively, co-released transmitters are stored in different vesicles, 
but in the same nerve terminal; they may then be differentially released, depending on the 
frequency and pattern of action potential activity.50,51 Thus, effective release of peptides 
usually requires repetitive action potentials or bursts of action potentials, unlike co-released 
amino acids or amines (see Chapter 13). A similar distinction has been observed between 
the pattern of activity required for the release of the same transmitter (5-HT) from clear 
vesicles at the nerve terminals and dense-core vesicles in the soma of the same neuron.52
In the mammalian central nervous system, the fast transmitters (glutamate or GABA) 
are often contained in and released from the same nerve terminals as those that store ACh, 
a monoamine, or a peptide.53 Thus, the recurrent collaterals of motor axons that excite 
Renshaw interneurons in the spinal cord, which were originally deduced to be cholinergic,54
have recently been shown to also release glutamate.55 Co-release of glutamate and ACh has 
also been recorded from single axons of cholinergic neurons from the basal forebrain56
(Figure 15.9). Previous immunocytochemical work had indicated that VGLUT and the ACh

synthesizing enzyme ChAT were sometimes both present in basal forebrain neurons, but 
their co-release at cortical synapses could not be tested directly using electrophysiological 
methods because the postsynaptic (muscarinic) action of ACh is slow and temporally dis-
sociated from the afferent nerve impulses (see Chapters 12 and 14). The solution adopted 
was to generate an autaptic glutamate-transmitting neuronal synapse in single cell culture 
(Figure 15.9A,B) and then to use a skeletal muscle myoball containing nicotinic receptors as 
a fast-responding ACh detector. In this way, it could be shown that both transmitters were 
released simultaneously from the same axon (though not necessarily from the same bouton) 
(Figure 15.9C). A similar autapse approach has been used to show co-release of glutamate 
with dopamine from single dopaminergic neurons of the ventral midbrain.57 In such cases, 
glutamate subserves the basic function of synaptic excitation while the co-released amine 
(or peptide) provides a more long-lasting modulatory function. Since the latter effect relates

the same neuron forming an autapse. (B) An ac-

the neuron soma through a patch electrode. The

most closely to the overall function of the neurons (see Chapter 14), it is useful to preserve 
their amine or peptide-based labels, such as cholinergic, etc., as originally suggested by Dale.46
Axonal Transport
Proteins found in axon terminals must have been shipped there from the cell body, where 
they are synthesized. The first evidence for movement of material along axons came from 
experiments by Weiss and his colleagues, who ligated peripheral nerves and described the 
ballooning out of axons just proximal to the site of constriction, and the subsequent move-
ment of the accumulated material along the axons after the constriction was removed.58 These 
effects suggested that normally there is a continuous bulk movement of axoplasm along the 
axon at the rate of 1–2 mm/day, which was given the name axoplasmic flow. This idea was 
buttressed by later experiments using radioactively labeled amino acids59 and fluorescent 
proteins60 to follow the movement of proteins from neuronal cell bodies along peripheral 
and central axons. Such movement has even been observed in single axons in cell culture 
(Figure 15.10)61 and in organelles along living nerve fibers, followed by cinematography.62

Rate and Direction of Axonal Transport
Measurement of the time course of accumulation of material proximal to a constriction or in 
axon terminals demonstrated characteristic differences in the rates of movement within the 
broad spectrum of components being transported. Structural proteins, such as tubulin and 
neurofilament proteins, move at the slowest rates (1–2 mm/day), while membrane-enclosed 
organelles, such as mitochondria and vesicles (including synaptic vesicles packed with transmit-
ter), move much faster (up to 400 mm/day).63 Such rapid movement could not be accounted 
for by the bulk flow of cytoplasm, and thus the general term axonal transport was adopted.
Some proteins and organelles move toward the axon terminal (anterograde transport) 
and others from the terminal to the cell body (retrograde transport).62,64 Retrograde trans-
port of membrane-enclosed organelles returns material to the cell body for recycling or 
degradation, and it has been shown to be crucial for the movement of trophic molecules, 
such as nerve growth factor, from axon terminals back to cell bodies (see Chapter 25).65
Neuroanatomists have developed tracers, such as horseradish peroxidase, fluorescently 
labeled beads, and even viruses that are carried in anterograde and retrograde directions 
by axonal transport. Using tracers such as these, it is possible to map synaptic connections, 
even over long distances, by visualizing individual axons, their terminal arborizations, and 
their cell bodies.66,67
Microtubules and Fast Transport
Although early experiments demonstrated that axonal transport required metabolic energy 
and relied on intact microtubules, for 30 years little progress was made in understanding its 
mechanism. Then two technological advances triggered very rapid progress: (1) the devel-
opment of microscopic techniques that allowed direct visualization of single vesicles within 
cells, 68,69 and (2) the finding that vesicle movements persisted in cell-free systems, such as 
extruded squid axoplasm.70 Studies by Reese, Sheetz, Schnapp, Vale, Block, and their col-
leagues have demonstrated that transport occurs by the attachment of organelles, such as 
mitochondria and vesicles, to microtubules. Mechanochemical enzymes, or motors, hydrolyze 
ATP and use the energy to carry organelles along the microtubule track (Figure 15.11).71,72
Microtubules have an inherent polarity; in axons, the plus (i.e., positive) end points 
toward the distal axon terminal. Anterograde transport is powered by kinesin, which moves 
organelles toward the plus end, while retrograde transport is powered by cytoplasmic 
dynein, which moves organelles toward the minus (i.e., negative) end (Figure 15.12).73
Specific receptors on the surface of organelles mediate the attachment of either kinesin or 
cytoplasmic dynein and thus regulate the direction of organelle movement (Figure 15.13).74
Remarkably, a single kinesin motor has been shown to pull an organelle along at speeds 
equivalent to fast axonal transport;75 each molecule of ATP hydrolyzed produces a step of 
approximately 8 nm, corresponding to the distance from one αβ tubulin dimer to the next 
along the microtubule protofilament.76,77 Differences in the rate of transport of different 
components arise from differences in the proportion of time they remain on track and in the 
resistance they encounter trying to penetrate the dense network of cytoskeletal and cross-
bridging elements within the axon. In synaptic regions, actin forms the major cytoskeletal 
protein and myosins are the main molecular motors.78 Analogous stepping transport by 
myosin has recently been examined in detail using high-speed atomic force microscopy.79
Mechanism of Slow Axonal Transport
Soluble proteins of intermediary metabolism and cytoskeletal elements, such as microtubules 
and neurofilaments, move from the cell body toward the axon terminal by slow transport.62

There is considerable debate about whether microtubules and neurofilaments move as in-
tact polymers80 or if polymerized filaments are stationary and tubulin and neurofilament 
monomers or oligomers are transported.81 What is clear is that diffusion cannot account 
for the axonal transport of cytoskeletal proteins and that an active process is involved.
Removal of Transmitters from the Synaptic Cleft
The final step in chemical synaptic transmission is the removal of transmitter from the 
synaptic cleft. The mechanisms for transmitter removal include diffusion, degradation, 
and uptake into glial cells or nerve terminals.
Removal of ACh by Acetylcholinesterase
As described in Chapter 11, the action of ACh is terminated by the enzyme acetylcho-
linesterase (AChE), which hydrolyzes ACh to choline and acetate. Much of the choline is 
transported back into the nerve terminal and reused for ACh synthesis. At the vertebrate 
skeletal neuromuscular junction, AChE is bound to the synaptic basal lamina—that portion 
of the muscle fiber’s sheath of extracellular matrix material that occupies the synaptic cleft 
and junctional folds (Figure 15.14).82 There are 2600 catalytic subunits of AChE per square 
micrometer of synaptic basal lamina83 (compared to the 104 AChRs per square micrometer 
in the postsynaptic membrane).
It might seem inefficient to have acetylcholinesterase situated between the axon ter-
minal and the postsynaptic membrane, forcing molecules of ACh to traverse a minefield 
of degradative enzymes before having an opportunity to interact with their postsynaptic 
receptors. However, if the dimensions of the cleft and the rates of ACh diffusion, binding, 
and hydrolysis are taken into consideration, a simple scheme emerges, which is called

the saturated disk.84 Following the release of one quantum, the concentration of ACh 
increases almost instantaneously (within microseconds) across the width of the cleft to 
a level high enough (0.5 mM) to saturate both ACh receptors and esterase within a disk 
approximately 0.5 μm in diameter centered on the release site. Binding of ACh to its 
receptors and to AChE is rapid compared to the rate at which AChE can hydrolyze ACh (it 
takes AChE 0.1 milliseconds to hydrolyze one molecule of ACh). Therefore, the fraction 
of ACh molecules released that bind initially to postsynaptic receptors is determined by 
the ratio of receptors to esterase; thus, approximately 20% of the ACh molecules bind 
to AChE and 80% to ACh receptors.
Binding causes a precipitous fall in ACh concentration. The concentration then remains 
low because AChE can hydrolyze ACh molecules much faster (10 molecules per ms) than 
they are released from receptors as the channels close (τ = 1 ms; see Chapter 11). Thus, by 0.1 
ms or so after release, the concentration of ACh in the cleft has fallen to levels that make the 
probability of two ACh molecules being available to bind and open another receptor negligible.
Such an analysis predicts that inhibition of acetylcholinesterase should have a more 
pronounced effect on the duration of the synaptic potential than on its amplitude, which 
is the case. Amplitude is increased 1.5-fold to 2-fold, and the duration is increased 3-fold 
to 5-fold.85,86 Thus, the organization of the neuromuscular junction and the density and 
kinetic properties of ACh receptors and AChE combine to produce a synapse that is capable 
of very rapid responses and efficient use of ACh.
Acetylcholinesterase seems to have a similar function in cholinergic nerve–nerve synapses, 
such as those in autonomic ganglia, in that its inhibition prolongs the synaptic current.87,88
However, much of the AChE at these sites is located on the presynaptic fibers,89,90 where 
it probably has the additional function of reducing the ACh overspill during repetitive 
nerve activity. Cholinesterase inhibitors produce a much more dramatic enhancement 
and prolongation of the slow synaptic current produced by repetitive afferent stimulation, 
which results from stimulation of muscarinic ACh receptors outside the immediate area 
of the synapse91 (see Chapters 14 and 17).
Removal of ATP by Hydrolysis
The action of ATP like that of ACh is rapidly terminated by hydrolysis.92 Ecto-ATP diphos-
phohydrolase (ecto-ADPase or ecto-apyrase) hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and ADP to AMP. 
AMP is converted to adenosine by ecto-5ʹ-nucleotidase. Both enzymes are found on glial 
cells, and at synaptic sites on neurons. At many synapses, adenosine modulates synaptic 
transmission by combining with receptors on pre- and postsynaptic cells.93 Its action is 
terminated by uptake and by adenosine deaminase, which degrades adenosine to inosine.
Removal of Transmitters by Uptake
The actions of dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, 5-HT, glycine, and GABA are termi-
nated by uptake of the transmitter into presynaptic nerve terminals, postsynaptic cells, or 
glial cells by specific transport proteins.94,95 Transmitters transported into nerve terminals 
can be repackaged and released again. This process was first shown for norepinephrine up-
take into sympathetic nerve endings by Julius Axelrod and his colleagues.96,97 They found 
that radioactively labeled NE was accumulated in sympathetically innervated tissues, that 
this was prevented by sympathetic denervation, and that the labeled NE could be released 
again by sympathetic nerve stimulation.
The properties of these membrane transporters are described in detail in Chapter 9. 
There are separate membrane transporters for norepinephrine, dopamine, and 5-HT, and 
for the amino acids glutamate, GABA, and glycine. These are distinct from the vesicular 
transporters and show less substrate overlap (though there is some overlap between the 
norepinephrine and dopamine transporters). The transporters for the monoamines are 
important targets for a number of drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders, such as depres-
sion, and also for some recreational drugs, such as cocaine and the amphetamines94 (see 
Chapter 14).
There appear to be no specific uptake mechanisms for peptide transmitters. Their 
transmitter action is terminated by diffusion, and some by peptidase hydrolysis.98

SUMMARY
 
■
ACh, norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, 5-HT, 
histamine, ATP, GABA, glycine, and glutamate are low-
molecular-weight transmitters. Neuropeptides form a 
second group of transmitters.
 
■
Many neurons release more than one transmitter, 
typically a low-molecular-weight transmitter and one or 
more neuropeptides.
 
■
Low-molecular-weight transmitters are synthesized in 
axon terminals, packaged in small synaptic vesicles, 
and stored for release. Feedback mechanisms control 
the number and activity of enzymes that catalyze 
transmitter synthesis so as to maintain an adequate 
supply of transmitter.
 
■
Neuropeptides are synthesized in the cell body, 
processed and packaged in large dense-core vesicles 
in the Golgi apparatus, and transported to the axon 
terminal.
 
■
Slow axonal transport moves soluble proteins and 
components of the cytoskeleton from the cell body to 
the axon terminal at a rate of 1 to 2 mm/day.
 
■
Fast axonal transport moves vesicles and other 
organelles at speeds of up to 400 mm/day either toward 
the terminal (anterograde transport) or toward the cell 
soma (retrograde transport). Fast transport is mediated 
by molecular motors that move organelles along 
microtubules.
 
■
The final step in chemical synaptic transmission is 
the removal of transmitter from the synaptic cleft by 
diffusion, degradation, or uptake. Prompt transmitter 
removal is important for normal synaptic function.

■ CHAPTER 16
Synaptic Plasticity
T
he efficacy of transmission at a synapse is not fixed, but can vary as a consequence of pat-
terns of ongoing activity. Short trains of presynaptic action potentials can produce either 
facilitation of transmitter release from the presynaptic terminal that persists for several 
hundred milliseconds, or depression of release lasting for seconds, or a combination of both. More 
prolonged trains of presynaptic action potentials produce post-tetanic potentiation (PTP), an in-
crease in transmitter release that can last for several minutes. An intermediate phase of enhance-
ment, classified as augmentation, decays with a time course similar to that of synaptic depression. 
These changes in synaptic efficacy are closely linked to accumulation of calcium in the presynap-
tic cytoplasm during activity, and its subsequent extrusion.
At many synapses repetitive activity can produce not only short-term changes, but also altera-
tions in synaptic efficacy that last for hours or even days. The two phenomena of this type are 
known as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP is mediated by an 
increase in calcium concentration in the postsynaptic cell that sets in motion a series of second-
messenger systems that recruit additional receptors into the postsynaptic membrane and, in addi-
tion, increase receptor sensitivity. LTD appears to be associated with smaller increases in post-
synaptic calcium concentration and is accompanied by a reduction in the number and sensitivity 
of postsynaptic receptors. LTP and LTD appear to involve presynaptic mechanisms as well. Both 
LTP and LTD have been postulated to be substrates for various forms of learning and memory 
formation. 

318 Chapter 16
So far, we have discussed excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in terms of a single 
action potential arriving at the presynaptic nerve terminal, causing depolarization, calcium 
entry, and transmitter release, followed by a postsynaptic potential change. Under such cir-
cumstances, except for statistical variations, the postsynaptic responses at any given synapse 
are relatively regular and stereotyped. During everyday activity, however, synapses in the 
nervous system are not usually activated by the arrival of an occasional presynaptic action 
potential. Instead, constant streams of action potentials invade the terminals—sometimes 
regularly with clock-like intervals, other times in bursts of varying frequency and duration. 
Such ongoing activity can have marked effects on the efficacy of synaptic transmission.
Short-Term Changes in Signaling
Facilitation and Depression of Transmitter Release
When a brief train of stimuli is applied to a presynaptic nerve, the amplitude of the resulting 
postsynaptic potentials may progressively increase (synaptic facilitation), decrease (synaptic 
depression), or undergo a combination of both. This process is illustrated in Figure 16.1A, 
which shows end-plate potentials recorded from a frog neuromuscular junction, produced 
by a short train of impulses to the motor nerve. The end-plate potentials were reduced in 
amplitude by lowering calcium in the bathing solution so that the initial quantum content 
of the potentials was low (less than 10). The amplitudes of the potentials (measured from 
the starting point of each rising phase) increase progressively during the train. Furthermore, 
the effect outlasts the stimulus train, so that the response to a test stimulus occurring 230 
milliseconds (ms) later is still larger than the first response in the sequence. 
Transmitter release can also be subject to synaptic depression if the number of quanta 
released by a train of stimuli is large. A similar experiment on a muscle in higher calcium 
concentration is shown in Figure 16.1B. Here, the quantal release is very large, but the 
responses have been reduced in amplitude by blocking the postjunctional acetylcholine 
(ACh) receptors with curare. During repetitive stimulation, the responses become progres-
sively smaller in amplitude. As with facilitation, depression outlasts the stimulus train (not 
shown) and can persist for several seconds. After a long train of repetitive stimulation, 
depression can be severe, reducing the amplitude of the synaptic potential to less than 
20% of its previous value. 
Figure 16.1C illustrates how facilitation and depression can interact at intermediate 
levels of release. During the train of impulses, the initial facilitation is overridden by depres-

sion, so that there is no increase in response amplitude after the 
second response. Later, when the test pulse is given, facilitation 
has largely worn off and only depression remains.
Post-Tetanic Potentiation and Augmentation
A relatively long, high-frequency train of stimuli (commonly called 
a “tetanus” because such a train of stimuli applied to a muscle or 
to its motor nerve produces a tetanic muscle contraction) usu-
ally results in synaptic depression but is followed a few seconds 
later by an increase in synaptic potential amplitude that can per-
sist for tens of minutes. This is called post-tetanic potentiation 
(PTP). An example is shown in Figure 16.2 from an experiment 
on a cell in a ciliary ganglion from a chicken, treated with curare 
to reduce the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential 
(EPSP). In addition, in order to prevent the synaptic potential 
from triggering an action potential, the cell was hyperpolarized 
(long downward deflection) before stimulating the presynap-
tic nerve. The first upward deflection is an electrical coupling 
potential (see Chapter 11), the second, slower depolarization 
is the EPSP, produced by release of ACh from the presynaptic 
terminal. It is the EPSP that is of interest. Initially the EPSP was 
only about 4 mV in amplitude (because of curarization). The 
presynaptic nerve was then stimulated at 100 pulses/second for 
15 seconds (1500 stimuli), which caused a transient depression of the EPSP (not shown). 
Fifteen seconds later, however, a single test stimulus produced an EPSP well over 20 mV 
in amplitude (Figure 16.2B)—so large, in fact, that it exceeded threshold and produced an 
action potential! The EPSP amplitudes produced by subsequent test shocks then declined 
(Figure 16.2C–E), but the response was still twice the pretetanic amplitude 10 minutes after 
the end of the tetanic stimulation (Figure 16.2F).
PTP is also associated with an increase in the rate of spontaneous, or tonic, transmitter 
release from the nerve terminal. The ongoing appearance of individual miniature synaptic 
potentials is accelerated after the tetanus and then declines to resting level over the same 
time course as the potentiation itself.1,2
An intermediate phase of enhancement of transmitter release by repetitive stimulation 
has been designated augmentation.3 It is produced by stimulus trains of moderate duration, 
comes on more slowly than facilitation, and decays over a period of several seconds. At the 
frog neuromuscular junction, augmentation and facilitation together can increase synaptic 
potential amplitude by a factor of more than five.
Facilitation, depression, augmentation, and PTP, although first observed at the vertebrate 
neuromuscular junction, occur throughout the vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. 
Their characteristic time courses are as summarized in Figure 16.3A–C. The decay of facilitation 
is not a simple exponential process, but instead has two components. A small component decays 
over a relatively long period with a time constant of about 250 ms. Superimposed on that is

a much larger and briefer component with a decay time constant of about 50 ms.4 Decay of 
augmentation and recovery from depression both occur over periods of several seconds. PTP 
usually decays with a time constant of several minutes. These four phenomena are referred 
to as short-term changes in synaptic efficacy to distinguish them from two changes that last 
much longer, found at synapses in the central nervous system (CNS)—they are long-term 
potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). As indicated in Figure 16.3D, LTP and 
LTD persist for hours. They will be discussed in detail later in this chapter.
Mechanisms Underlying Short-Term Synaptic Changes
Short-term changes in synaptic efficacy during and following repetitive activity are related 
to increases or decreases in the number of quanta of transmitter released from the presynap-
tic terminals and not, for example, to a change in the size of an individual quantum or to a 
change in the sensitivity of the postsynaptic membrane.1,5,6 As we discuss in Chapter 13, the 
amount of transmitter released by any one stimulus depends on the size of the readily releas-
able pool of synaptic vesicles within the terminal and on the fractional release from the pool 
(i.e., the average probability that any vesicle will be released). The fractional release, in turn, 
is dependent on the amount of calcium that enters the terminal through voltage-activated 
calcium channels. The release probability varies with the third or fourth power of the calcium 
influx.7–9 Traditionally, facilitation and potentiation have been ascribed to increases in release

probability mediated by increases in available calcium, and depression to depletion of the re-
leasable pool of vesicles. Recent experiments have revealed a rather more complicated picture. 
FACILITATION Experimental evidence obtained by Katz and Miledi in 1968 suggested 
that facilitation of transmitter release during a train of action potentials in the presynaptic 
terminal might be related to a progressively increasing residue of calcium left over from the 
previous stimuli.10 The residual amounts, themselves insufficient to trigger release, would 
add to the next bolus of incoming calcium, thereby increasing the release probability. The 
decay of facilitation over time would then represent the return of intracellular calcium to 
its resting level. This idea that calcium accumulation is involved in some way is supported 
by observations at a variety of synapses that buffering intracellular calcium concentration 
with calcium chelators attenuates facilitation.11
Subsequent studies indicate that increased cytoplasmic calcium has additional effects 
that can contribute to facilitation. For example, experiments on glutamatergic synapses 
in the auditory brainstem of the rat have shown that facilitation is also accompanied by a 
progressive increase in calcium influx with each impulse during a conditioning train.12,13
These synapses have calyciform presynaptic terminals (calyces of Held), and whole-cell patch 
clamp recordings can be made simultaneously from the terminals and the postsynaptic 
cells.14 Transmitter release is mediated by P-type (CaV2.1) calcium channels.15 The calcium 
currents facilitate, and subsequently decay, with a time course similar to that of facilitation 
of transmitter release. Like facilitation, the increase in calcium current is dependent on 
calcium accumulation and is due to a shift in the voltage sensitivity of calcium channel 
activation. Although increased calcium influx is clearly a major contributor to facilitation, 
other factors, such as a direct effect of residual calcium on release, still play a role.9,16
DEPRESSION Depression of synaptic potentials is seen only after a relatively large quantal 
release, which suggests that one underlying factor is depletion of vesicles from the nerve 
terminal during the conditioning train.1,17 However, large quantal release is also accompa-
nied by large calcium entry, so calcium accumulation may contribute in some way as well. 
Indeed, early experiments on the frog neuromuscular junction indicated that depression 
was accompanied by a reduction in release probability.18 Similar experiments on cultured 
rat hippocampal neurons have led to the same conclusion.19
Experiments on calyx of Held synapses have shown depression of presynaptic calcium 
currents by prior conditioning pulses.15,20 As with facilitation, the amount of depression 
depends on the amount of calcium entering the cytoplasm during the conditioning period. 
During repetitive activation at low frequencies, this reduction in calcium current and the 
consequent reduction in release probability are the major factors underlying depression. 
However, at frequencies of 100/s or more and with normal levels of transmitter release, 
depletion of the available pool contributes as well, accounting for as much as 50% of the 
reduction in release. At these frequencies, calcium currents are first facilitated and then 
depressed, and recovery from depression occurs over a period of several tens of seconds. 
In spite of the early facilitation of calcium current during the train, the corresponding 
excitatory postsynaptic currents show immediate depression due to depletion. Subsequent 
recovery occurs in two phases, the first over a period of seconds, reflecting recovery from 
depletion, and the second with a time course parallel to that of recovery from depression 
of the presynaptic calcium current.
AUGMENTATION AND PTP Like facilitation and depression, augmentation and PTP 
are associated with increased intracellular calcium concentration. Experiments on the 
neuromuscular junction of the frog showed that if calcium is removed from the bathing 
solution during application of the conditioning train, then no potentiation occurs.21 At the 
crayfish neuromuscular junction, PTP is reduced in magnitude and duration by treatments 
that interfere with calcium uptake and release by mitochondria, suggesting that calcium 
influx during the tetanus may be accompanied by rapid mitochondrial calcium loading.22
In that event, excess mitochondrial calcium might be released slowly, thereby prolonging 
the elevation of cytoplasmic calcium concentration and maintaining the potentiation. 
On the other hand, PTP is not dependent on sodium entry, as it can be produced by 
trains of artificial depolarizing pulses applied to the nerve terminal in the presence of

tetrodotoxin (TTX).23 In that circumstance, the magnitude of the potentiation is increased 
with increasing extracellular calcium concentration, and, in very high calcium (83 mM), 
PTP can last for more than two hours. While sodium is not necessary for potentiation, 
sodium entry nevertheless contributes to its duration. At the rat neuromuscular junction, 
potentiation is prolonged by treatments that block extrusion of sodium by Na-K ATPase, 
such as adding ouabain or removing potassium from the bathing solution.24 Prolongation 
may occur because increased intracellular sodium reduces the rate at which accumulated 
calcium is extruded by sodium–calcium exchange. 
In the calyx of Held, high-resolution fluorescent dye techniques have been used to 
measure calcium transients produced by single presynaptic stimuli. After induction of PTP, 
presynaptic calcium influx increased by about by about 15%.25 At the peak of PTP, average 
cytoplasmic calcium concentrations increased from a resting value of about 50 nM to over 
200 nM. The calcium concentration then declined to its resting level with a time course 
that paralleled that of the decay of PTP.26,27
The increase in presynaptic calcium influx suggests that PTP and augmentation are due, 
at least in part, to an increase in transmitter release probability. The sustained increased in 
intracellular calcium concentration may also result in an increase in the size of the releas-
able pool. One technique for estimating the releasable pool size is to induce rapid, ongo-
ing transmitter release until the pool is exhausted and then estimate how much has been 
released. For example when a train of stimuli, say at 100 Hz, is applied to the presynaptic 
nerve the resulting synaptic potentials (or currents) decrease steadily in amplitude toward 
zero. The summed amplitudes of all the synaptic responses then provide an estimate the 
total amount of transmitter that was in the pool. A minor complication is that the responses 
never go to zero because of ongoing replenishment of the pool from back-up stores, but 
appropriate allowance can be made to accommodate this factor.
Depletion experiments on synapses between cultured hippocampal neurons indicate 
that augmentation is due to an increase in release probability, with no apparent increase 
in the size of the releasable pool of transmitter.28 On the other hand, depletion experi-
ments on the calyx of Held synapses have shown that during PTP the releasable pool does 
increase in size.29 The magnitude of the PTP depended on the frequency and duration of 
the conditioning tetanus, with synaptic currents reaching a maximum of about four times 
the control amplitude following a 6000-shock tetanus. The potentiation was accompanied 
by a maximum increase of about 70% in the size of the releasable pool, and an increase in 
release probability by a factor of about 2.5. PTP decayed in two phases. The first phase, with 
a time-constant of about one minute, was due to a return of the release probability toward 
its resting value and probably represented an underlying contribution of augmentation 
to the overall process. The second phase extended over a period of 10 to 20 minutes and 
represented the return of the releasable pool to its resting size.
The various factors underlying short-term synaptic plasticity seem at first to be 
somewhat bewildering, so it is useful at this point to summarize what we have learned. 
First, all forms of short-term plasticity are related to presynaptic calcium accumulation. 
This accumulation results in calcium-activated alterations in influx though presynaptic 
calcium channels. At modest levels of activation a progressive increase in intracellular 
calcium concentration first facilitates channel currents; then, as the calcium concentra-
tion continues to build up, facilitation gives way to depression. The changes in channel 
currents follow the same time course as facilitation and depression of transmitter release. 
At higher levels of release, depression is also mediated in part by depletion of the releas-
able pool. During prolonged stimulation, calcium accumulation eventually leads to 
augmentation which, like facilitation, is associated with increased calcium flux through 
the voltage-activated channels. The early stages of PTP are attributable, at least in part, 
to augmentation, and the more prolonged component reflects an increase in size of the 
releasable pool of vesicles. 
The next question to be answered is how increased intracellular calcium acts to modulate 
calcium channel function. Catterall and his colleagues have approached this question by looking 
at the effects on facilitation and depression of mutations in CaV2.1 channels.30 The channels 
were expressed in cultured superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons, and the transfected cells 
formed cholinergic synaptic connections with adjacent SCG cells in the culture. Mutations 
were made on the channel α1-subunits at two nearby locations on the C terminus. At one

location, an isoleucine and a methionine residue at adjacent positions (IM) were replaced by 
two alanines (AA). At the other, a calmodulin-binding domain (CBD) was deleted.
When two stimuli were applied to a presynaptic cell containing native channels, the 
second EPSP in the postsynaptic cell showed depression at short, inter-shock intervals 
(< 50 ms) and then showed facilitation as the interval between the stimuli was increased 
to 100 ms. Facilitation then declined toward zero as the inter-shock intervals approached 
200 ms. At synapses with IM–AA mutations, facilitation was virtually absent. Deletion of 
the CBD segment, on the other hand, removed almost all of the depression. The authors 
conclude that changes in calcium channel conductance observed during facilitation and 
depression of transmitter release are mediated by conformational changes in the channel 
produced by selective binding of calcium–calmodulin to the C-terminal sites. 
Although the experiments that we have discussed here provide a general picture of fac-
tors underlying short-term plasticity, the actual details may vary considerably from one type 
of synapse to the next. For one thing, most of the experiments in which changes in calcium 
channel currents were examined were done on calyx of Held synapses, which contain CaV2.1 
channels with P/Q-type currents. Release of transmitter at synapses in the peripheral nervous 
system and in some parts of CNS is subserved predominantly by calcium influx through 
CaV2.2 channels with N-type currents, which may have quite different properties.8 Another 
factor to consider is the progressive effects of increased calcium concentration inside the 
presynaptic terminal membrane. In the calyx of Held synapse, the increase in intracellular 
calcium first mediates facilitation of channel currents; then, as the concentration builds up 
further, facilitation switches to inhibition. With this scenario, the overall effect of calcium 
influx can be expected to depend markedly on physical factors, one example being the size of 
the terminal. In very small terminals with a large surface-to-volume ratio, calcium concentra-
tion could build up rapidly so that the overriding effect is inhibitory, whereas in very large 
terminals the build up could be much smaller, yielding only facilitation. Similarly, differences 
between presynaptic terminals in the cytoplasmic concentration and distribution of calcium 
chelators could produce marked differences in behavior. 
Long-Term Changes in Signaling
In the CNS, repetitive activity can produce changes in synaptic efficacy that last much lon-
ger than those seen at peripheral synapses. These longer lasting changes have been found 
in a variety of brain locations and are particularly intriguing because their long duration 
suggests that they may be associated in some way with memory. Two basic changes can be 
induced: long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD).
Long-Term Potentiation
Long-term potentiation (LTP) was first described by Bliss and Lømo in 1973 at glutama-
tergic synapses in the hippocampal formation.31,32 This structure, which lies within the 
temporal lobe of the brain, consists of two regions known as the hippocampus and the 
dentate gyrus, which in cross section appear as interlocking C-shaped strips of cortex, 
plus the neighboring subiculum (Figure 16.4). Its orderly arrangement of cells and input 
pathways enables recording electrodes to be inserted into the brain of the intact animal and 
placed in close proximity to known cell types, or even intracellularly, to record synaptic 
potentials. Similarly, stimulating electrodes can be located in specific input pathways. Bliss 
and Lømo demonstrated that high frequency stimulation of inputs to cells in the dentate 
gyrus produced a subsequent increase in the amplitude of excitatory synaptic potentials 
that lasted for hours or even for days (Figure 16.5). This is now known as homosynaptic 
LTP. Although LTP has been shown to occur in other regions of the brain, including several 
neocortical areas, and even in autonomic ganglia,33 it has been studied most extensively in 
CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices in vitro.34
Associative LTP in Hippocampal Pyramidal Cells
Experiments by T. H. Brown and his colleagues revealed that repetitive activity at one 
synaptic input to a cell could potentiate synaptic potentials generated by stimulation of

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80: 7347–7351.
another input to the same cell.35 This is called associative LTP. An example is shown in 
Figure 16.6. Intracellular recordings were made from pyramidal cells in area CA1 of the 
hippocampus, and two extracellular stimulating electrodes were located in the input 
pathway (the Schaffer collateral/commissural tract) in such a way as to stimulate sub-
populations of axons innervating two different regions on the dendritic arbors of the 
pyramidal cells (Figure 16.6A). The stimulus intensities were adjusted so that electrode 
I evoked a large synaptic potential in a pyramidal cell, while electrode II evoked a much 
smaller one. Records of EPSPs produced by electrode II are shown in Figure 16.6B. Brief 
trains of stimuli (100 Hz for 1 second repeated once again after 5 seconds) applied to 
electrode I resulted in LTP of the synaptic potentials at that input (not shown), as in the 
experiments of Bliss and Lømo. The stimuli applied to electrode I had no effect on the

smaller EPSP produced by electrode II (Figure 16.6B, second record). Also, high-frequency 
stimulation with electrode II did not produce LTP of the smaller response (third record). 
However, after high-frequency stimulation by I and II together, there was an increase in 
the size of the EPSPs produced by electrode II (fourth record), lasting for tens of minutes 
(Figure 16.6C). This was called associative LTP because the prolonged increased response 
to input II was produced only when repetitive stimulation of that input was associated 
with simultaneous stimulation of input I. 
Associative LTP is particularly interesting because it illustrates a possible mechanism for 
conditioned reflexes, the classic example being conditioning a dog to salivate in response 
to the sound of a bell. 
Like short term changes in signaling, LTP can be separated into three components, 
based on their time course of decay.36 Their induction depends in part on the duration and 
intensity of the conditioning stimulus. The response of CA1 pyramidal neurons to three 
different conditioning protocols is summarized in Figure 16.7. A single 100 Hz conditioning 
train increased the size of the EPSP by about 130%, and the increase decayed back to zero 
over the next 2 hours. Four conditioning trains produced about the same increase, but the 
potentiation decayed less rapidly—after 2 hours the EPSPs were still potentiated by 30%. 
With eight conditioning trains, the decay was still slower, with 80% of the potentiation 
persisting after 2 hours.

Mechanisms Underlying the Induction of LTP
Although many synaptic changes associated with LTP have been described in great detail, 
a single coherent picture of the underlying mechanisms has yet to emerge. For example, 
some experiments have shown conclusively that the phenomenon is presynaptic, others 
that that only postsynaptic factors are involved. Current evidence points to both.37 One 
or the other may dominate depending on the type of neuron being studied and on the 
conditions of the experiment. We begin by considering postsynaptic mechanisms for LTP.
An important factor in the postsynaptic expression of LTP is an increase in calcium 
concentration in the postsynaptic cell. In the CA1 pyramidal cell this increase is accomplished 
by entry of calcium through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors (see 
Chapter 14). The NMDA receptor forms a cation channel with the unusual characteristic 
that it is blocked at normal resting potentials. The block is due to occupation of the channel 
by magnesium ions from the extracellular solution, which are removed when the receptor 
is depolarized.38,39 Most glutamate-sensitive cells express both NMDA and non-NMDA 
receptors in their postsynaptic membrane.40 The non-NMDA receptors are sensitive to 
α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA). Both types of receptors 
are activated by glutamate released from excitatory presynaptic terminals. NMDA receptors 
have a relatively high calcium conductance, but calcium entry does not occur until synaptic 
depolarization is sufficient to remove magnesium block of the channels.
Involvement of NMDA receptors in LTP is indicated by the fact that NMDA antagonists 
block the induction of LTP, but do not prevent LTP if they are applied after it has been in-
duced.41,42 However, recent experiments indicate that entry of calcium through the synaptic 
channels is not in itself adequate for the induction of LTP, and that the three different phases 
of LTP (see Figure 16.7) are mediated by different calcium pathways.43 In dendritic spines 
and distal dendrites, calcium entry into the cytoplasm through NMDA receptors serves to 
trigger additional calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Calcium-induced 
calcium release from the ER depends on activation of ryanodine (Ry) receptors and/or ino-
sitol triphosphate (IP3) receptors. Block of Ry receptors selectively inhibits calcium release 
in synaptic spines and abolishes short-lasting LTP. Block of IP3 receptors inhibits calcium 
release along dendrites and abolishes LTP of intermediate duration. Long-lasting LTP that 
persists after the first two phases does not depend on NMDA receptors at all. Instead, it is 
mediated by calcium entry through L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the cell soma. 
Silent Synapses
One of the major factors in the postsynaptic expression of LTP is the activation of silent 
synapses.44 In the first few postnatal days, CA1 synapses in rats and mice are virtually devoid 
of AMPA receptors, so that most do not respond to presynaptic stimulation. As dendritic 
spines develop, NMDA receptors are expressed first, followed by AMPA receptors, which 
over the next few weeks appear at roughly half the synapses. Suppose that in a mature syn-
apse some presynaptic excitatory boutons overlie postsynaptic regions on dendritic spines

that contain only a few AMPA receptors, or perhaps none at all. Under resting conditions, 
release of a quantum of glutamate from these boutons will produce little or no response; 
thus, these synaptic contacts will be silent and only a fraction of the synaptic apparatus 
will respond to presynaptic excitation (Figure 16.8A). Now suppose that the induction of 
LTP leads to insertion of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membranes of the silent 
synapses. These will now respond to quanta released from the presynaptic terminal, and 
the quantum content of the response will increase (Figure 16.8B).
There is now substantial evidence that AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, 
which turn over quite rapidly at rest (see Chapter 14), are upregulated during the expression 
of LTP. The most direct evidence is the demonstration that AMPA receptor subunits are 
delivered to dendritic spines after repetitive stimulation accompanied by NMDA receptor 
activation.45 The AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 (now called GluA1; see Chapter 5) was 
tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and expressed transiently in hippocampal 
CA1 pyramidal cells. When cell dendrites were examined with laser-scanning and electron 
microscopy, most of the protein (GluA1–GFP) in the dendrites was found in intracellular 
compartments and only about half of the dendritic spines showed fluorescence. After 
stimulation, tagged receptors were delivered rapidly to dendritic spines and, in addition, to 
clusters on the dendrites. Almost all of the spines were fluorescent, even those nearly devoid 
of label before stimulation. The results indicate that many of the excitatory dendritic spines 
are silent and receive a full complement of AMPA receptors after repetitive stimulation.
Additional evidence for upregulation of AMPA receptors has been summarized by 
Nicoll and his colleagues.32,44 For example, it has been shown by immunohistochemistry 
that all Schaffer collateral–commissural synapses contain NMDA receptors but that only 
a fraction of these contain co-localized AMPA receptors.46 Correspondingly, electrophysi-
ological experiments reveal many synapses in CA1 pyramidal cells that are activated only 
by NMDA; these synapses acquire AMPA responses during LTP.47,48 Still other experiments 
have demonstrated that after induction of LTP new spines appear on the CA1 pyramidal 
cell dendrites.49 Potentiation of the synaptic response by about 80% was accompanied by 
roughly a 13% increase in measured spine density. A particularly interesting experiment 
involved the induction of LTP by artificial application of glutamate to dendritic spines of 
CA1 cells.50 The cells were transfected with green fluorescent protein so that the spines

and spine heads could be visualized readily. Caged glutamate was 
uncaged by a 2-photon laser, in a very small area near a spine, in 
amounts sufficient to produce synaptic currents similar to miniature 
EPSCs. Repetitive uncaging (1/s for 1 min) resulted in an increase in 
spine head volume by about a factor of three. The increase in volume 
then decayed over a period extending well beyond 1 hour. Presynaptic 
stimulation of Schaffer collaterals produced the same response. The 
effect was particularly persistent in small dendritic spines. Enlarge-
ment was prevented by NMDA receptor antagonists, and blocked by 
calmodulin inhibitors. 
How does increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration lead to 
upregulation of AMPA receptors? One calcium-dependent biochemical 
pathways that has been shown to be important for induction of LTP is 
calcium–calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII).51 CaMKII 
is found in high concentrations in the postsynaptic densities of dendritic 
spines, and intracellular injection of inhibitors of CaMKII prevents the 
induction of LTP.52,53 The sequence of events leading to upregulation 
is shown in Figure 16.9. During LTP, the incoming calcium binds to 
calmodulin to activate CaMKII, which maintains its own activity by 
autophosphorylation after the calcium concentration has returned to 
basal levels. CaMKII then has two effects: (1) it phosphorylates AMPA 
receptors present in the membrane, thereby increasing their channel 
conductance, and (2) it facilitates mobilization of AMPA receptors from 
the cytoplasm into the plasma membrane.54 The synapses return to 
their previous resting state over time because of constitutive recycling 
of AMPA receptors into and out of the membrane.55
The third phase of LTP, which can last for very long times, is dependent on gene tran-
scription and protein synthesis.56,57 As we have already noted, its induction is dependent 
on calcium accumulation in the cell soma by influx through voltage-sensitive calcium 
channels. Several biochemical pathways are involved in linking calcium accumulation to 
transcription. For example, activation of modulatory receptors may be linked to adenyl 
cyclase, leading to phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). 
The resulting gene expression involves not only receptor proteins, but also other structural 
and functional proteins, suggesting that an essential long-term consequence of LTP is 
growth and remodeling of the synapse. The mechanisms whereby transcripts and proteins 
are transported from the soma to specific synaptic regions are not known.
Presynaptic LTP
LTP is not only expressed postsynaptically. For example, at mossy fiber synapses on CA3 
pyramidal cells, LTP occurs even when a postsynaptic increase in calcium concentration 
is completely prevented by blocking both NMDA receptors and voltage-sensitive calcium 
channels, and loading the postsynaptic cell with a high concentrations of a calcium chelator. 
This observation led to the conclusion that LTP at that synapse was entirely presynaptic.58
The underlying mechanisms are not at all clear, but one step may involve the recurrent 
action of glutamate on presynaptic metabolic glutamate receptors (mGluR; see Chapter 
12) or on presynaptic kainate receptors (see Chapter 5).
A number of experiments have indicated that presynaptic LTP occurs at CA1 pyramidal 
cell synapses as well.59 In these experiments, LTP was associated not with an increase in 
the amplitude of miniature EPSPs (quantal size), as would be expected from an increase 
in postsynaptic sensitivity, but rather with an increase in the number of quanta released 
from the terminal (quantum content). An example is shown in Figure 16.10, where the 
amplitude distribution of the synaptic potentials is plotted before and after potentiation. 
In this and other experiments, statistical analysis of the amplitude distributions indicated 
that the mean quantum content of the potentiated synaptic potential was increased.60,61
The results shown in Figure 16.10 could be accounted for in theory by the scheme 
shown in Figure 16.8, where quantal release is the same before and after conditioning, but 
the observed quantum content is increased because additional postjunctional spines are

CaMKII phosphorylates AMPA receptors already present in the 
postsynaptic membrane and promotes the insertion of new re-
ceptors from a reserve pool. (After Malenka and Nicoll, 1999.)

made responsive by insertion of AMPA receptors. Subsequent experiments indicate that 
this is not entirely the case. Transmitter release after induction of LTP was examined at 
single synaptic contacts on CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites.62 The cells were injected with a 
calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye, and simultaneous recordings were made of EPSP am-
plitudes in the cell soma and of changes in fluorescence in single dendritic spines. Single 
quanta of transmitter released from the presynaptic terminal by presynaptic (Schaeffer 
collateral) stimulation produced brief calcium transients. The release occurred irregularly, 
with numerous failures interspersed between single- or multiquantal release. Typically, 
the probability of release on any one trial was about 20%. After repetitive stimulation, the 
probability roughly tripled and then declined over a period of more than an hour. During 
the period of potentiation, the amplitude of the fluorescent signal remained constant, 
indicating no change in postsynaptic receptor sensitivity at individual release sites.
In summary, LTP in CA1 pyramidal cells has three temporal components. During the 
conditioning stimulus, calcium influx across the synaptic membrane increases calcium con-
centration in the cytoplasm and releases additional calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER). Two pathways appear to be involved in release from the ER: one mediated by Ry receptors 
in dendritic spines, the second by IP3 receptors along the dendrites. These pathways are associ-
ated, respectively, with the first and second components of LTP. The increased intracellular 
calcium then activates CaMKII, as shown in Figure 16.9, leading to increased conductance 
of existing receptors and insertion of AMPA receptors in the membrane. The third, long-
lasting component of LTP appears to depend primarily on calcium entry into the cell soma 
through voltage-dependent calcium channels and is associated with gene transcription and 
expression. Finally, LTP at CA1 synapses also appears to involve an increase in transmitter 
release from the presynaptic nerve terminal, possibly lasting throughout the first two phases. 
Details of the mechanisms associated with the presynaptic changes have yet to be revealed.

E. R. Kandel and his colleagues indicated that habituation of the reflex by repeated tactile 
stimulation of the siphon or mantle was with depression of synaptic transmission in an 
identified gill motor neuron in the abdominal ganglion.63
In the vertebrate central nervous system, LTP was first reported at the Schaffer collateral 
input to CA1 pyramidal cells64 and has since been studied in a number of other regions 
of the brain.65 Homosynaptic LTD is a prolonged depression of synaptic transmission 
produced by previous repetitive activity in the same pathway (Figure 16.11A). It can be 
induced by a variety of stimulus protocols, such as prolonged low-frequency stimulation 
(1–5 stimuli/s for 5–15 min), low frequency stimulation with paired pulses, or brief high 
frequency stimulation (50–100 stimuli/s for 1–5 s). In Schaffer collaterals homosynaptic LTD 
is blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists66,67 as well as by pyramidal cell hyperpolarization 
and postsynaptic injection of calcium chelators. However, in other brain locations NMDA 
antagonists have no effect. Instead, induction of LTD appears to involve metabotropic 
glutamate receptors (mGluR).
Heterosynaptic LTD is a prolonged depression of synaptic transmission produced by 
previous activity in a different afferent pathway to the same cell (Figure 16.11B). This form 
of LTD was first reported as a correlate of homosynaptic LTP induced in Schaffer collateral 
input to CA1 pyramidal cells (i.e., induction of LTP in one pathway resulted in depression 
of transmission at nearby synapses). Later experiments, using chronic recordings from 
perforant pathway dentate gyrus synapses, showed that the depression could persist for 
days.68 The phenomenon is accompanied by a rise in postsynaptic calcium concentration, 
which in the hippocampus is mediated by NMDA receptor activation.69 However, it can also 
be induced by direct postsynaptic depolarization without activation of NMDA receptors. 
In the dentate gyrus, it is blocked by L-type calcium channel blockers.70
Associative LTD has been reported to occur with stimulus protocols similar to those 
used for associative LTP. Combined weak and strong stimulation of two inputs results in 
depression of the weakly stimulated input (Figure 16.11C). One difference between the 
protocols for associative LTP and associative LTD is that during induction of LTD the two 
stimuli are delivered out of phase. As in associative LTP, postsynaptic depolarizing pulses 
can substitute for the strong synaptic stimulation.71 Overall, however, experiments made to 
demonstrate associative LTD in the hippocampus have yielded inconsistent results, and in

some cases have required special stimulating protocols, such as prior priming by so-called 
theta (5 stimuli/s) stimulation. 
LTD in the Cerebellum
One important site of LTD is the cerebellar cortex. There, Purkinje cells receive excitatory 
input from two sources: parallel fibers (PF) that arise from granule cells and form synapses 
on secondary and tertiary dendrites; and climbing fibers (CF) from the inferior olive nucleus, 
which make strong synaptic connections on the soma and proximal dendritic tree. Parallel 
fibers use glutamate as a transmitter and their synapses contain both mGluR and AMPA 
receptors. The transmitter used by the climbing fibers has not been definitely identified. 
No NMDA receptors are found in the adult cerebellum.72
Cerebellar LTD was first studied by Ito and his colleagues.73 They applied a series of 
low-frequency (1–4/s) paired stimuli to parallel fiber and climbing fiber pathways (Figure 
16.11D) for about 5 minutes. Subsequent responses to parallel fiber stimulation were 
depressed for several hours. In addition, when application of glutamate to the dendritic 
field was paired with climbing fiber stimulation, subsequent responses to glutamate were 
depressed, suggesting that the phenomenon was mediated by postsynaptic changes. Reliable 
demonstration of cerebellar LTD proved somewhat difficult in vivo, but was established as 
an unambiguous phenomenon in cerebellar slice preparations74 and in culture.75 It was also 
shown, in both slice preparations and cerebellar cultures, that Purkinje cell depolarization, 
producing calcium action potentials in the dendrites (see Chapter 7), could substitute for 
climbing fiber stimulation in inducing LTD.76,77 However, neither climbing fiber stimulation 
nor depolarization alone is effective in inducing LTD; co-activation of glutamate receptors, 
either by parallel fiber stimulation or by direct application of glutamate, is required. In the 
case of parallel fiber stimulation, LTD is input specific, that is, only the stimulated inputs 
are depressed. LTD induction is blocked by postsynaptic calcium chelators,78 and there is 
a large calcium accumulation following climbing fiber stimulation.79
Mechanisms Underlying LTD
Conditions under which LTD can be produced vary considerably, depending on which 
type is being studied and in what location. One consistent feature is that LTD, like LTP, 
depends on postsynaptic accumulation of calcium.63 In the hippocampus, calcium entry 
appears to be primarily through NMDA receptors, although heterosynaptic LTD can be 
induced by depolarization alone without receptor activation and is attenuated by L-type 
calcium channel blockers. This suggests that while local depolarization and calcium ac-
cumulation through NMDA receptors produces LTP at the activated input, spread of 
depolarization to adjacent synaptic regions can produce LTD by calcium entry through 
voltage-gated calcium channels. In other brain regions free calcium concentration may 
be elevated by release from intracellular stores by IP3 after activation of metabotropic 
glutamate receptors (see Chapter 12). In cerebellar Purkinje cells, where NMDA recep-
tors are absent, calcium entry is through voltage-sensitive calcium channels that generate 
dendritic action potentials.
Why does calcium accumulation produce LTP in some circumstances and LTD in others? 
At the moment, there is no clear answer to that question except that the difference appears 
to be related to the increase in concentration. A relatively large increase results in LTP, a 
smaller increase in LTD. In accordance with this idea is the observation that a stimulus 
barely able to induce homosynaptic LTP in CA1 cells with normal extracellular calcium 
concentration produces LTD when extracellular calcium is reduced.65
The mechanisms whereby increased cytoplasmic calcium concentration lead to LTD 
expression appear to be the exact reverse of those responsible for LTP. LTD expression 
involves a reduction in postsynaptic sensitivity to applied glutamate and a reduction in 
amplitude of miniature excitatory synaptic potentials.80,81 Furthermore, during LTD in 
cultured hippocampal cells, there is a decrease in the number of AMPA receptors clustered 
in the postsynaptic membrane.82 These changes are accompanied by dephosphorylation 
of the GluA1 subunit of the AMPA receptors.83 As a general rule, during LTP trafficking of 
AMPA receptors into the membrane, and increased receptor sensitivity is associated with

protein kinase activity, whereas during LTD trafficking of receptors out of the membrane 
and reduced sensitivity involves activation of protein phosphatase.
Presynaptic LTD 
Habituation of the gill withdrawal reflex in Aplysia was initially shown to be accompanied 
by a reduction in the quantum content of the EPSP in the gill motor neuron.84 This find-
ing bolstered the idea, widely held at the time, that long-term plasticity, like its short-term 
counterpart, was essentially a presynaptic phenomenon. However, later experiments on 
LTD in Aplysia revealed that postsynaptic mechanisms were involved as well, mimicking 
those seen in the vertebrate CNS.85
In the hippocampus, there is evidence that supports presynaptic involvement in LTD 
in both CA1 and CA3 neurons.86,87 One indication of such involvement is provided by 
the experiments described previously in relation to LTP, in which transmitter release was 
examined at single synaptic contacts on CA1 pyramidal cell dendrites.61 As we have already 
discussed, during LTP the probability of release at any given contact increased markedly 
during LTP. Similarly, after induction of LTD, the probability of release at the dendritic 
synaptic contacts was reduced by an amount commensurate with the reduction in amplitude 
of EPSPs recorded from the cell soma.
Significance of Changes in Synaptic Efficacy
It is a matter of basic belief amongst those who study nervous system function that learn-
ing and memory involve long-term changes in synaptic efficacy and, for this reason, the 
mechanisms underlying LTP and LTD are of particular interest. This interest is strengthened 
further because both phenomena exhibit a characteristic postulated by Donald Hebb to 
be required for associative learning,88 namely that increases in synaptic strength should 
occur when the presynaptic and postsynaptic elements are coactive. Synapses that exhibit 
this property are known as “Hebbian,” and it is sometimes assumed that if the requirement 
has been satisfied, then learning has occurred. At any rate, a number of correlations have 
been established between changes in behavior and long-term changes in synaptic efficacy 
in several regions of the brain.56,89
For example, spatial learning in intact animals and LTP in hippocampal slices display 
a number of similarities.90–92 Both can be blocked by antagonists of NMDA receptors or 
metabotropic glutamate receptors and also by inhibitors of calcium–calmodulin protein 
kinase. However, the nature of the behavioral deficit associated with the block is not always 
clear. For example, rats under NMDA antagonists have general sensorimotor disturbances 
that interfere with negotiating a water maze (suggesting that learning ability has been 
compromised), but they can learn it readily if they first become familiar with the general 
requirements of the task.93 Thus, NMDA receptor-mediated LTP does not seem to be an 
essential requirement. Similar ambiguities have been encountered with gene deletions—
some that eliminate LTP produce a deficit in the spatial learning ability, others do not.94
There is growing evidence for the idea that LTP in the amygdala might be a substrate for 
aversive (or fear) conditioning. Rats trained to associate foot shock with an auditory tone 
exhibit an exaggerated auditory startle reflex, and cells in the amygdala show an LTP-like 
increase in their synaptic response to electrical stimulation of the auditory pathway from 
the medial geniculate nucleus.95,96 Conversely, induction of LTP at the same synapses by 
electrical stimulation results in an increase in the response to auditory stimuli.69 Both ef-
fects are blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists.97,98 In conclusion, while an unequivocal 
relation between LTP and spatial learning tasks has not been established, LTP may play a 
role in more discrete learning paradigms such as classical conditioning.

SUMMARY
 
■
Short periods of synaptic activation can result in 
facilitation, depression, or augmentation of transmitter 
release, or a combination of these effects.
 
■
Facilitation decays gradually over a few hundred 
milliseconds, while synaptic depression and 
augmentation persist for several seconds. 
 
■
Facilitation is related to a persistent increase in 
cytoplasmic calcium concentration in the presynaptic 
terminal.
 
■
Longer periods of repetitive stimulation result in post-
tetanic potentiation (PTP) of transmitter release, which 
can last for tens of minutes and, like facilitation, is 
mediated by an increase in presynaptic terminal calcium 
concentration.
 
■
In various parts of the central nervous system repetitive 
stimulation can result in long-term potentiation (LTP) or 
long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength.
 
■
The change in synaptic efficacy during LTP or LTD may 
be homosynaptic, involving only the stimulated input, 
or heterosynaptic, affecting adjacent synapses on the 
same dendrite. In addition, heterosynaptic effects may 
be associative, requiring the coordinate activation of 
both synapses.
 
■
LTP is produced by an increase in calcium 
concentration in the postsynaptic cell and involves both 
the insertion of new receptors into the postsynaptic 
membrane and an increase in receptor sensitivity.
 
■
LTD also requires an increase in postsynaptic calcium 
concentration and is mediated by a decrease in 
receptor number and sensitivity.
 
■
Both LTP and LTD can also involve changes in 
transmitter release from the presynaptic terminal.
 
■
Although there are some correlations between LTP 
and LTD and behavioral tasks involved in learning, no 
unequivocal relation between these long-term synaptic 
changes and memory formation have been established.

■ PART IV
Integrative Mechanisms
Beyond the mechanisms that individual neurons, glial cells, and synapses 
use to communicate, of prime interest for neurobiology is the behavior of 
an animal as a whole. The first of the two chapters in this section, Chapter 
17, deals with an essential function of the nervous system: the constant 
performance of “housekeeping tasks.” The cardiovascular, respiratory, and 
intestinal needs of an animal must be regulated by the autonomic nervous 
system as the animal flies, swims, runs, feeds, or walks. In this chapter, the 
biophysical, molecular, and chemical mechanisms described previously for 
neurons come together. Indeed, many key discoveries, such as the identifi-
cation of transmitters, were first made at sympathetic and parasympathetic 
synapses. In addition, it will be shown that the autonomic nervous system is 
not truly autonomous, and interacts with emotions and hormonal aspects of 
the functions of the brain. 
Similarly, Chapter 18 describes how the complex behavior of relatively simple 
animals is brought about by the integrated actions of nerve cells. Examples 
include the way in which ants and bees forage for food and then, in an ex-
traordinary manner, find their way home by using receptors that respond to 
ultraviolet light or to magnetic fields. In the leech, the circuits between identi-
fied individual sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons have been 
traced and their biophysical properties analyzed. Such information provides 
a basis for explaining how complex movements are initiated and carried out 
by the animal.


■ CHAPTER 17
Autonomic Nervous System
T
he autonomic nervous system controls essential functions of the body. Thus, neurons of 
the autonomic nervous system supply smooth muscles in the eye, lung, gut, blood vessels, 
bladder, genitalia, and uterus. They regulate glandular secretion, blood pressure, heart rate, 
cardiac output, and body temperature, as well as food and water intake. In contrast to speedy 
conduction and muscle contractions required for limb movements, these housekeeping or vegeta-
tive functions are slower, last longer and are not under the direct control of the will.
Four distinct groupings of neurons make up the autonomic nervous system. The sympathetic 
division consists of neurons with myelinated axons that leave the spinal cord through ventral roots 
from thoracic and lumbar segments. They form synapses on nerve cells in sympathetic ganglia 
situated alongside and at a distance from the spinal cord, and on chromaffin cells in the adrenal 
medulla. Sympathetic postganglionic axons are unmyelinated and extend over long distances to 
target areas. The parasympathetic division consists of axons leaving through certain cranial and 
sacral nerves. They form synapses in ganglia situated within or close to the target organs. Para-
sympathetic postganglionic axons are, in general, shorter than those of the sympathetic nervous 
system. A third, highly complex division consists of millions of nerve cells in the intestinal wall, the 
enteric nervous system. The fourth division comprises neurons in the spinal cord, hypothalamus, 
and brainstem. Within the central nervous system (CNS), boundaries between the autonomic and 
somatic nervous systems are not sharply defined.
Synaptic transmission in the autonomic nervous system is extraordinary in its diversity, and 
makes use of all the known transmitters. Principles of transmission and integration that were first 
revealed at autonomic synapses include the chemical nature of synaptic transmission, reuptake of 
transmitter, autoreceptors on presynaptic terminals, co-release of more than one transmitter at a 
single terminal, and the role of second messengers. In autonomic ganglia, the transmitters include 
acetylcholine (ACh), peptides, and dopamine. Parasympathetic postganglionic nerve terminals 
release acetylcholine as the primary transmitter, which acts on muscarinic receptors in the target 
organs, and, in addition, they release nitric oxide (NO) and peptides. Postganglionic sympathetic 
neurons release norepinephrine, epinephrine, acetylcholine, purines, or peptides as primary trans-
mitters. Autonomic neurons co-release peptides together with adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
Whereas much is known about the regulation of activity in smooth muscle and gland cells, 
less information is available about integrative mechanisms within the CNS that regulate autonomic 
functions. The periodic 24-hour cycle of activity, known as circadian rhythm, influences many au-
tonomic functions. Experiments in which recordings were made from specific neurons in the retina 
and in the hypothalamus have revealed cellular mechanisms that generate the rhythm.

338 Chapter 17
The name autonomic implies an independent system that runs on its own. In part, this is 
true. The autonomic nervous system controls blood vessels, the heart, glands, and smooth 
muscle throughout the gut, bronchi, bladder, and spleen, without our having to make 
conscious decisions. By a simple act of will one cannot increase the diameter of the pupil 
or the blood flow through one’s little finger. It is possible of course to cheat the system, to 
some extent, by the use of tricks; thus, the generation of emotion by deliberately thinking 
of an exam, a dental appointment, or a film starlet can stimulate the sympathetic nervous 
system to increase the heart rate.
In practice, the performance of the autonomic nervous system is closely linked to vol-
untary movements. Exercise results in appropriate diversion of blood to the muscles and in 
stimulation of sweat glands; the action of standing up from a recumbent position requires 
circulatory adjustments so as to maintain blood flow to the brain. Ingestion of a meal reroutes 
blood to the stomach and intestines. By turning activity on or off in a widespread group of 
target cells, the autonomic nervous system deals with the housekeeping and maintenance work 
of the body. The brain establishes the priorities, setting in motion digestion, reproduction, 
micturition, defecation, or focusing in dim light, through mechanisms that are not decided by 
our conscious will. Of key concern for human beings are disorders of the autonomic nervous 
system that lead to conditions such asthma, constipation, diarrhea, ulcers, hypertension, 
heart disease, stroke, and retention of urine (or lack thereof). We simply take for granted the 
regulation of essential bodily functions. For instance, it is remarkable that all the readers of 
this book have body temperatures of about 37°C and blood pressure values of about 120/80 
mm Hg, in spite of their very different metabolic rates (and states of mind while reading).
Recent experiments and classical work on the autonomic nervous system represent 
such an extensive and varied field that a comprehensive review is impossible in this 
chapter. Indeed, entire textbooks1,2 and specialized journals3–5 are devoted to important 
functions of the autonomic nervous system. A large amount of information is available 
about mechanisms that control the enteric nervous system and bladder, the diameter of 
the pupil, secretion by glands, and that regulate respiration, temperature, body weight, 
appetite, and reproduction.6–8
In this chapter, as in others, the main emphasis is on a few selected examples that 
illustrate cellular, molecular, and integrative mechanisms. It will be shown that although 
much is now known about the autonomic nervous system, many open questions remain, 
particularly about integrative mechanisms within the CNS. There the distinction between 
autonomic and somatic systems has no hard-and-fast boundaries. It is convenient to begin 
with a brief description of the principal features of the peripheral autonomic nervous system.
Functions under Involuntary Control
Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems
The principal anatomical features are shown in Figure 17.1. Virtually all the organs of the 
body are supplied by autonomic neurons. Even skeletal muscle fibers, which receive no 
direct innervation, are dependent on the autonomic nervous system—their blood supply 
is regulated according to need. Sympathetic preganglionic neurons are situated in the in-
termediolateral horn of the spinal cord of segments T1 to L3. Their myelinated axons pass 
through ventral roots to form synapses in ganglia situated alongside the vertebral column 
and peripheral to it (Figure 17.1A). From these ganglia, unmyelinated axons run to the tis-
sues. By contrast, the parasympathetic outflow is restricted to cranial nerves III, VII, IX, and 
X and sacral roots S2, S3, and S4 (Figure 17.1B). The parasympathetic ganglia are located 
close to or in the tissues themselves. Hence, the parasympathetic myelinated preganglionic 
axon is long, whereas the unmyelinated postganglionic axon is short.
The actions of the two systems are often, but not always, antagonistic (Table 17.1). For 
example, excitation of sympathetic neurons leads to dilatation of the pupil, increased heart 
rate, and decreased gut motility. Parasympathetic excitation produces opposite effects, such 
as pupillary constriction, slowed heart rate, and increased gut motility. On the other hand, 
glandular secretion can be increased by activation of either system. Both systems can cause 
smooth muscles to contract or to relax, depending on the transmitter that is released and 
the types of receptors that are present on the muscle.

A major difference between the two autonomic systems is that, while the parasympathetic 
nervous system functions in a focused manner, the sympathetic nervous system tends to be 
thrown into action as a whole, with widespread generalized consequences for the body. The 
sympathetic system is typically activated under conditions of fright, fight, and flight as well as 
during intense exercise. The symptoms are familiar; they include dilated pupils, dry mouth, 
pounding heart, sweating, and enhanced emotions. The systemic effects of sympathetic 
neuronal activity are enhanced further by chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. These 
cells are modified ganglionic neurons. They receive cholinergic input from preganglionic 
axons and secrete epinephrine, norepinephrine, peptides, and ATP as hormones into the 
bloodstream.9,10 Epinephrine in the blood reinforces and extends sympathetic activity. It 
can reach and bind to receptors in smooth muscle of bronchi, far from sympathetic nerve 
endings; epinephrine also binds to receptors in blood vessels that are insensitive to nor-
epinephrine (see Box 17.1). Unlike norepinephrine, epinephrine produces vasodilatation 
as well as contraction of blood vessels.
By contrast, the parasympathetic nervous system is more focused in its activity. 
It is surely a considerable advantage that the pupil can constrict in bright light and 
that the lens of the eye accommodate for viewing nearby objects selectively, without 
concomitant and ill-timed arousal of bladder contractions or even more embarrassing 
parasympathetic effects.

340 Chapter 17
Synaptic Transmission in Autonomic Ganglia
Certain mechanisms of transmission in the autonomic nervous system have already been 
described in earlier chapters (see Chapters 11, 12, and 14). These include the co-release of 
multiple transmitters from nerve endings, modulatory actions of autonomic transmitters, 
the properties of receptors that use second messengers, and the effects of acetylcholine and 
epinephrine on cardiac muscle. The way in which such mechanisms interact to influence 
signaling is well illustrated by experiments made on synaptic transmission in autonomic 
ganglia. These synapses also serve to demonstrate integrative processes occurring within 
the central nervous system that are even more complex.

aAccounts of the actions of the autonomic nervous system on target organs listed in this table that are not dealt 
with in this chapter are given in reviews and textbooks of physiology and pharmacology (see references in text).
bNot all the adrenergic receptors or effector cells are included; purinergic, peptidergic, and cholinergic mecha-
nisms are dealt with in the text. Whereas epinephrine acts on all the adrenergic receptors, norepinephrine is effec-
tive on α1, α2, and β1-receptors but only weakly on β2. The various types of adrenergic and muscarinic receptors 
are characterized by the specific agonists and antagonists that bind to them and by their molecular structures.

Autonomic ganglia constitute relay stations, the functional significance of which is 
not immediately obvious. At first glance the mechanism of direct, rapid transmission is 
similar to that at the skeletal neuromuscular junction.11 Each presynaptic impulse releases 
acetylcholine, which acts on nicotinic receptors in the postsynaptic cell to open channels 
and produce a fast depolarization (see Chapter 11).12 As at the nerve–muscle junction, a 
single presynaptic action potential is followed by one in the postsynaptic cell (Figure 17.2). 
The nicotinic receptors, however, are different in their subunit composition from those at 
the motor end plate, being made up of alpha and beta subunits but without gamma, delta, 
or epsilon subunits.13
Transmission at the synapse between the preganglionic axon and the ganglion cell 
is far more elaborate than would at first appear. Thus, a very different picture emerges 
with repetitive stimulation of the presynaptic axon at frequencies comparable to those 
occurring normally in the animal. Under these conditions, the ganglion is not simply 
a throughway, but is a site of complex interactions. With trains of impulses, prolonged 
depolarizing and hyperpolarizing, long-latency synaptic potentials arise in the ganglion 
cell.14,15 They summate to produce a steady, subthreshold depolarization maintained for 
seconds, minutes, or even hours. During the depolarization a single presynaptic action 
potential can now give rise to multiple postsynaptic impulses. Both the fast and the 
slow synaptic potentials are evoked by the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic 
nerve terminals. As before, the fast, direct synaptic potential results from activation of 
nicotinic ACh receptors. The slow potential is due to activation of muscarinic ACh recep-
tors that are coupled to G proteins16,17 (see Chapter 12). The low level of cholinesterase 
activity that is present in the ganglion does not greatly enhance nicotinic transmission, 
unlike its effect at neuromuscular synapses. It does however facilitate the activation of 
muscarinic receptors.
Kuffler and his colleagues found that a second transmitter also contributes to slow 
depolarizing and hyperpolarizing synaptic potentials. Certain presynaptic axons release 
a decapeptide that resembles luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). (LHRH 
is also known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH]; see Figure 17.8.) Hence, in

Unlikely as it might seem, this description of ganglionic transmission has been over-
simplified. Integration in sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia is further modulated by 
interneurons known as small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells containing catecholamines and 
also by presynaptic endings that release vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and enkephalins.18
In addition, as at neuromuscular synapses, ACh and ATP released by nerve terminals act 
back on presynaptic receptors to modulate their subsequent release.19
M-Currents in Autonomic Ganglia
What is the mechanism responsible for the slow depolarizations produced by ACh and 
LHRH? This question was resolved by Brown, Adams, and their colleagues, who identified 
an unusual potassium current carried by M-channels—so called because they are influenced 
by muscarinic ACh receptors.20,21 M-channels, also known as KCNQ/KV7, have a high open 
probability at rest and make a substantial contribution to the resting potassium conduc-
tance. With depolarization, their probability of opening increases. An unusual property of 
the M potassium channels is that activation of muscarinic receptors causes these channels 
to close (Figure 17.3). As a consequence, the resting influx of sodium ions is no longer in 
balance with potassium efflux and the cell depolarizes.
After their discovery in autonomic ganglia, M-channels were found in neurons in the 
spinal cord, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex.22,23 M-channel closure produced by trans-
mitters results from activation of phospholipase C.17,23,24 This in turn leads to hydrolysis 
and depletion of membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate—a molecule that is 
required for channel opening (see Chapter 12).
What is the physiological importance of M-currents in autonomic ganglia? The principal 
effect of the M-current is to raise the threshold for firing an action potential. Thus, when

effect of the decrease in the M-current 
during the slow synaptic potential is to 
increase the excitability of the ganglion 
cell. Depolarizing current pulses ap-
plied through the microelectrode (lower 
traces) before and after a slow synaptic 
potential produce a single action poten-
tial. During the slow potential, the same 
current pulse elicits a burst of action 
potentials. Depolarizing the ganglion cell 
(to the same extent as occurs during 
closure of M-channels) by injecting a 
maintained current has no such effect 
on the responsiveness of the cell. (After

a neuron with an M-current is depolarized, it only fires one or two action potentials then 
becomes silent. The steps that cause this to happen are:
initial depolarization opens M-channels→M-channels generate an 
outward potassium current→potassium current counteracts inward sodium current 
in initial phase of action potential→prevents full action potential from developing
When the M-current is suppressed through closure of the K channels by the transmitter, 
this series of steps does not happen and the neuron fires repetitively (see Figure 17.3). In 
other words, the neuron switches from phasic-firing to tonic-firing mode when the M-
current is suppressed. Some sympathetic neurons (e.g., in prevertebral ganglia) do not 
have M-currents and they do fire tonically rather than phasically.25
M-channels have a major effect on firing patterns in the autonomic nervous system. In cells 
with large M-currents, such as those that cause dilatation of the pupil, presynaptic inputs do 
not fire tonically and the output is roughly one to one.26 By contrast, cells in lumbar ganglia 
that cause vasoconstriction receive a continuous bombardment from presynaptic inputs. This 
inhibits their M-currents through the muscarinic effect of acetylcholine. Accordingly, they 
fire tonically at varying frequencies, depending on the input, and produce greater or reduced 
tonic vasoconstriction. These results fit with the special requirement of discontinuous, episodic 
dilatation of the pupil on demand and maintained control of blood vessel diameter. Tonic 
and phasic discharges have additional effects; they can determine which types of transmitter 
are to be released by the terminals of a ganglion cell onto its targets.
Transmitter Release by Postganglionic Axons
Although acetylcholine is the principal transmitter used by postganglionic parasympathetic 
axons, they can co-release nitric oxide (NO)27 and peptides (Figures 17.4 and 17.5) For 
example, ACh released by parasympathetic axons causes salivary glands to secrete by acting 
on muscarinic receptors. With high-frequency stimulation, the same axons also liberate a 
peptide called vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). VIP, originally found in gut and brain, 
causes vasodilatation, increased intracellular calcium concentration, and increased secretion 
of saliva that is not blocked by atropine, which is an antagonist for muscarinic receptors.28
For sympathetic postganglionic neurons, norepinephrine is the principal transmitter. 
Sympathetic axons innervating sweat glands and blood vessels in skeletal muscle, however, 
secrete acetylcholine instead of norepinephrine.29 Sympathetic nerve fibers also secrete 
ATP and peptides, which are co-released with the conventional transmitters. The locations 
of some of the transmitters used in intestinal reflexes are shown in Figure 17.4 and 17.5.
Table 17.1 shows the principal locations of adrenergic receptors in the body and their 
mechanisms of action. With the advent of molecular biology, it became clear that the

frequencies releases acetylcholine but not VIP, while at higher frequencies

amino acid sequences are similar in the α1 and α2, as well as the β1, β2 and β3 adrenergic 
receptors, and also in the muscarinic receptors activated by ACh. All these receptors contain 
seven transmembrane segments, are coupled to G proteins, and use second messengers (see 
Chapters 12 and 14; Box 17.1).
Purinergic Transmission
In a remarkable series of experiments, Burnstock and his colleagues demonstrated the 
existence of a major class of sympathetic transmitters, the purines: ATP and adenosine.30
Certain sympathetic nerve fibers secrete ATP from their terminals, either as the principal 
transmitter or together with norepinephrine or acetylcholine. The experiments showing 
that ATP is a sympathetic transmitter were originally designed for a quite different pur-
pose. Burnstock and Holman31 recorded intracellularly from smooth muscle fibers of the 
reproductive system to investigate sympathetic synaptic transmission, which at the time 
was supposedly mediated by norepinephrine. Their recordings of spontaneous miniature 
potentials constituted an important finding, since, before this time, quantal release had

The Path to Understanding Sympathetic Mechanisms
 
The development of concepts about mechanisms of synaptic 
transmission in the autonomic nervous system spanned many 
years. The original work of Henry Dale in the 1930s and 1940s 
showed that excitatory and inhibitory transmission in target or-
gans is extremely complicated. One source of confusion arose 
from the idea that epinephrine might be the transmitter mol-
ecule liberated by sympathetic nerves (as originally suggested 
by Elliott in 1904). It was not until von Euler32 discovered that 
norepinephrine, not epinephrine, is the principal transmitter 
released by sympathetic nerves that the distinction between 
hormonal and transmitter actions could be accounted for.
Epinephrine released from the adrenal medulla reaches 
receptors in cells that are not innervated by sympathetic 
axons—for example, on smooth muscle fibers of bronchioles 
in the lung. It can also act on receptors that are insensitive to 
norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerve fibers. A major 
advance was made by Ahlquist,33 who devised the scheme for 
classifying α and β-adrenergic receptors by comparing specific 
agonists and antagonists. This classification was essential for 
explaining the varied excitatory and inhibitory sympathetic ac-
tions that occur on blood pressure, smooth muscle, the gut, 
bronchi, and glands. The discovery that some sympathetic ax-
ons release acetylcholine (ACh) or purines was also essential.
An understanding of the transmitters and receptors used 
by the autonomic nervous system has allowed new drugs to 
be developed for treatment of diseases. One example is pro-
vided by the control of bronchioles in the lung. Bronchocon-
striction occurs in asthma or severe anaphylactic reactions of 
the immune system. To initiate relaxation of smooth muscle in 
the bronchi, β2-receptors are activated by giving epinephrine 
or a more specific agonist (such as salbutamol, a β2-agonist 
used for the treatment of asthma), but not norepinephrine, 
which has little or no effect on β2-receptors. Bronchodilatation 
allows the patient to breathe again. Another example is pro-
vided by the beta-blockers that are widely used and highly ef-
fective in the treatment of high blood pressure, coronary artery 
disease, and glaucoma. As their name implies, these drugs 
act by blocking the actions of norepinephrine and epinephrine 
on β-receptors in the heart, in the smooth muscle of blood 
vessels, in the kidney, and in the eye.34

been observed only at the skeletal neuromuscular junction. Later, however, Burnstock and 
his colleagues35 showed that norepinephrine is not the sole transmitter and that the sym-
pathetic neurons co-release a purine (i.e., ATP) and a peptide (neuropeptide Y). The min-
iature potentials in the smooth muscle are, in fact, due to ATP rather than norepinephrine 
acting directly on ion channel receptors.
Two main families of receptors for purines have been identified, sequenced, and cloned 
(see Chapters 4 and 12). A family of eight or more P1 receptors is situated in pre- and 
postsynaptic structures in the periphery and in brain. They are activated preferentially 
by adenosine and are G protein coupled. Although ATP is the transmitter liberated from 
presynaptic endings, enzymes rapidly break it down to adenosine, which is the natural 
agonist for the P1 receptors. ATP does act directly on a family of P2 receptors36 in the 
central and the peripheral nervous systems, where it regulates endocrine secretion, smooth 
muscle contractility, and activates nociceptive C-fibers.37
Sensory Inputs to the Autonomic Nervous System
This description of the autonomic nervous system has failed to mention essential com-
ponents: sensory inputs and reflex regulation. Indeed, in textbooks of physiology and 
pharmacology, the autonomic nervous system is often treated as though it functioned as 
a purely motor system for smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands.
One reason for neglect of autonomic regulation is the paucity of our knowledge. 
Mechanisms of smooth muscle contraction, such as blood vessel constriction and dilata-
tion, the forward propulsion of material through the gut, and bladder emptying seem 
relatively straightforward compared to, say, playing tennis. And yet the integration that is 
required is far from simple. On the afferent side, sensory receptors in the eye, the lungs, the 
blood vessels, the viscera, and other target tissues provide information about the organs 
concerned8,38 (see Figure 17.5). These include nociceptive receptors that signal information 
about painful stimuli.
A deceptively simple and well-studied reflex is the response of the circulation to changes 
in body position. With the human body lying flat, the brain is supplied by blood without 
differences in pressure between the legs and the head. The assumption of a vertical stance 
causes a drop in blood pressure above the level of the heart, as blood accumulates in the 
gut and the legs. In the absence of autonomic regulation, loss of consciousness results 
from standing up, owing to diminished blood flow through the brain.2 The receptors that 
signal the need for a change in the pattern of circulation are situated in a large artery in 
the neck, the carotid artery. The endings are stretch receptors embedded in a swelling of 
the arterial wall, known as the carotid sinus. Distension of the wall causes increased firing, 
as shown in Figure 17.6.
The sensory axons run to the brainstem and terminate in a well-defined nucleus (the 
nucleus of the solitary tract). These neurons project to neurons in the brainstem reticular 
formation, which in turn project to the autonomic preganglionic neurons. In the horizontal 
position, a high rate of sensory firing gives rise to inhibition of cardiovascular sympathetic 
outputs (see Figure 17.6). Blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output are depressed, and 
blood vessels in the skin and gut are dilated, when one is lying down. With assumption of 
vertical posture, the pressure in the artery falls and the rate of firing of the carotid sinus 
axons is reduced dramatically, removing the central inhibition. The resulting release of 
sympathetic activity causes blood vessels in the skin and gut to constrict, and cardiac output 
and heart rate to rise. The increase in pressure maintains blood flow through the brain.
The ancient recordings in Figure 17.6C, made by Anrep and Starling using a pointer 
that scratches the surface of a rotating smoked drum, still provide good illustrations of 
these effects.39 It was the same E. Starling who, with W. M. Bayliss in 1902, first coined the 
word “hormone” and proposed the concept of hormonal action while they worked on the 
control of secretion in the gut.
The description of the reflex presented in Figure 17.6 appears simple. But the central 
sympathetic and parasympathetic integrative mechanisms for rerouting blood where it 
is urgently needed remain a black box.8 This is also the case for other autonomic reflexes 
for which the sensory and motor limbs are known—for example, enteric, excretory, and 
respiratory reflexes.2,40

The Enteric Nervous System
Local regulatory reflexes in the gut (see Figure 17.5) are extremely complex and are 
brought about by vast numbers of neurons. The enteric nervous system contains more 
than 10 million nerve cells arranged in the wall of the intestine as sensory neurons, 
interneurons, and motor neurons. Every known transmitter is represented there (and 
many of them were first discovered in the gut). To analyze the intrinsic circuits is dif-
ficult because of the profuse local reflexes and numbers of connections.41,42 Functional 
analysis has been a major challenge even in simpler systems, such as the viscera of the 
lobster. When Selverston and his colleagues43 began to study the stomatogastric ganglion, 
with its complement of only 30 neurons, it seemed that it could perhaps be worked out 
completely. Yet, although great progress has been made by electrical recordings from 
identified neurons and although principles of general significance for neurobiology have 
been discovered, a complete understanding is still not at hand. What appeared at first to 
be a simple circuit for regulating gut functions turned out to be plastic and modifiable 
rather than static and hardwired.

Regulation of Autonomic Functions by the Hypothalamus
Hormones provide an essential aspect of control of the autonomic nervous system. The 
secretion of hormones by glands (such as the thyroid, the ovary, the adrenal cortex) is 
regulated by releasing factors secreted in the CNS (discussed in the sections that follow). 
The hormones in turn act back on the CNS to regulate the secretion of releasing factors, 
creating a feedback loop.
The hypothalamus (Figures 17.7 and 17.8) is a brain area that controls integrative auto-
nomic functions, including body temperature, appetite, water intake, defecation, micturition, 
heart rate, arterial pressure, sexual activity, lactation, and, on a slower timescale, growth.44
The precision of these homeostatic mechanisms enables us to keep our body temperature at 
about 37° C, our blood pressure at about 120/80 mm Hg, our heart rate at 70 beats/minute, 
and our intake and output of water at 1.5 liters/day. In addition, the hypothalamus makes 
it possible for food to be propelled inexorably along the alimentary tract with appropriate 
secretions for digestion and absorption at every level. The hypothalamus is also a brain 
area in which appetite, emotions, and responses to bodily exercise are regulated. Emotions 
are coupled to autonomic responses. Even the thought of food leads to secretion of saliva, 
and the anticipation of exercise gives rise to increased sympathetic activity.
Appetite is regulated by a remarkable series of steps involving cells that store fat.45,46
When adipocytes are activated by β3-receptors they secrete a 167-amino acid protein 
known as leptin, which acts on cytokine receptors situated in the membranes of neurons 
in a variety of hypothalamic nuclei. Leptin gene expression is increased by over feeding 
and reduced by starvation (see Figure 17.7). Other delicately controlled functions are the 
extraordinarily precise and regular rhythms generated by the hypothalamus. Slow rhythms 
include those that control endocrine secretion.
For example, sexual and reproductive functions oscillate with periods of weeks that 
depend on secretion of peptide hormones by hypothalamic cells. These act on the anterior 
pituitary gland to stimulate secretion of other hormones into the bloodstream.
Hypothalamic Neurons That Release Hormones
A well-studied example of hormonal release is provided by neurons within the hypo-
thalamus that secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH, which is the same as 
LHRH).47 A prime action of these neurons is to secrete GnRH into a portal system of 
blood vessels that flow directly from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary gland 
(see Figure 17.8). Neurally released GnRH thereby acts selectively on a gland that is not 
directly innervated, enabling the central nervous system to control hormonal secretion.

the body decreases. (After Rahmouni, Haynes, and Mark, 2004.)

Thereafter, the releasing hormone is diluted in the major vessels of the circulation and 
cannot, for example, influence synaptic transmission in autonomic ganglia. In the anterior 
pituitary gland (adenohypophysis), GnRH stimulates specific cells to secrete gonadotropin—
a hormone that is essential for sexual and reproductive rhythms and functions.
This brief, oversimplified account cannot do justice to the beautiful experiments of G. 
W. Harris, who first demonstrated that the local release of a releasing hormone from the 
hypothalamus could provide an essential control mechanism.48 His description of delivery 
of a chemical message through a system of blood vessels by highly localized transport was 
a revolutionary concept.
Distribution and Numbers of GnRH Cells
GnRH cells are dispersed throughout the hypothalamus, with no clearly defined nucleus 
or aggregate. The previous section dealt only with those GnRH cells close to the anterior 
pituitary gland (in the median eminence) that promote its gonadotropin secretion (see 
Figure 17.8). The release of the releasing hormone itself is also influenced by hormones, 
such as those secreted by the ovary that feed back into the brain and by synaptic inputs 
mediated by a variety of transmitters, including norepinephrine, dopamine, histamine, 
glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).49
One extraordinary feature of the GnRH cells is their small number: 1300 in rats and 
800 in mice.50 Rats and mice (and human beings) would become extinct without these 
few, scattered cells in the brain. A second remarkable feature is their development (see 
Chapter 23). During embryonic days 10 to 15 in rats, the precursor cells first appear in a 
region known as the olfactory placode. This is the region destined to be the future olfactory 
mucosa. After dividing, the cells migrate along axons of the olfactory nerve and end up in 
the hypothalamus.51 The pathways and molecular mechanisms of GnRH cell migration have 
been studied in embryos, in newborn opossums, and in culture systems.52 Since all the cells 
can be reliably marked by specific antibodies to GnRH, they can be counted quantitatively 
at the site of origin and as they migrate. Other types of neurons migrate along the same 
axonal pathway as the GnRH cells. Before reaching the hypothalamus, however, they branch 
off along other axons to reach distinctively different destinations.53
Figure 17.8 shows that in addition to the GnRH cells in the hypothalamus, there ex-
ist specific populations of neurons that secrete other hormones required for autonomic 
functions. Metabolism, thyroid function, absorption of salts by the kidney, and growth all 
depend on releasing hormones that are secreted into the portal system and that act on the 
anterior pituitary gland.
Specific hypothalamic neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (see Figure 
17.8) innervate the posterior pituitary gland directly. Their endings release antidiuretic 
hormone (ADH, also known as vasopressin) and oxytocin into the blood.54–56 Hence, 
the control of water absorption by the kidney and the contractions of the uterus depend 
directly on the firing of hypothalamic neurons.
Circadian Rhythms
Of particular importance in the life of an animal are the circadian rhythms that control 
the day–night or wakefulness–sleep cycle. In the absence of all external synchronizing 
cues, 24-hour rhythmical cycles are maintained by an internal clock for prolonged peri-
ods (weeks or months) in invertebrates as well as vertebrates,57–59 and even in explants 
or isolated neurons in culture.60 The internal timing mechanism can be altered (or en-
trained) by providing regularly spaced light and dark stimuli. Autonomic functions are 
strongly influenced by biological clocks that act on the pineal gland and the secretion 
of melatonin.61,62
In mammals, a key structure in the hypothalamus for generating the rhythm of the 
internal clock is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). An important input to this nucleus is 
from the eye.63,64 After destruction of the suprachiasmatic nucleus in rats, light and dark 
entrainment of endogenous rhythms becomes lost. Locomotor activity, drinking, sleep–wake 
cycles, as well as rhythms of hormone secretion become disrupted. If fetal hypothalamic 
tissue containing the SCN is transplanted to a host previously rendered arrhythmic by a

responding to the donor genotype.65 Information about cellular and molecular mechanisms 
that produce regular night and day cycles has been obtained in both invertebrates and 
vertebrates.66–68 Examples of circadian rhythms produced by cells in culture are shown in 
Figures 17.9 and 17.11.
Until recently, there was an apparent paradox concerning the way in which light 
and dark could entrain the day–night cycle. This paradox arose from the properties 
of neurons in the visual cortex, which do not respond at all to changes in the level of 
illumination, but rather only to bars, edges, and moving patterns. Even in the retina, 
recordings from ganglion cells had shown that the best stimulus for them to fire is not 
the level of illumination but contrast (see Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 20). This problem has 
been resolved by the discovery of a small number of specialized ganglion cells that are 
themselves photoreceptors. These photoreceptive ganglion cells contain the pigment 
melanopsin and respond to diffuse illumination (Figure 17.10). Their axons project to 
the suprachiasmatic nucleus rather than to the lateral geniculate nucleus. If all the rod

and cone receptor responses are abolished, the pupil still constricts in bright light and 
the day–night rhythm can still be entrained.69–72
In neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the frequency of spontaneous action po-
tentials increases during the day and decreases at night, as shown in Figure 17.11. By what 
mechanism is the rhythm produced? This problem has been investigated in slices of rat 
SCN in culture where GABA has been shown to be a major transmitter.73 Yarom and his 
colleagues74 have shown that certain groups of suprachiasmatic neurons in a slice respond 
to GABA with depolarization and increased rates of firing during the day (Figure 17.11A). 
The same concentration of GABA applied at night causes hyperpolarization and a decrease 
in rate (Figure 17.11B). Hence, as in developing central nervous system,75 GABA can be an 
excitatory or an inhibitory transmitter76 (see Chapters 11 and 25). The type of response 
depends on the level of internal chloride. As described in Chapter 11, when the internal 
chloride concentration is low, the chloride equilibrium potential (ECl) is more negative 
than the resting potential. Opening of channels by GABA allows chloride ions to enter and 
the membrane to hyperpolarize. With raised internal chloride concentrations, ECl shifts to 
a value positive with respect to the resting membrane potential. As a result, GABA causes 
chloride ions to move out of the cell and gives rise to a depolarization. The change from 
inhibition to excitation is actively regulated by the activity of NKCC1and KCC2 chloride 
transporters77,78 (see Chapter 9). The mechanisms by which those transporters are dif-
ferentially regulated during the day–night cycle are not yet known.
Common proteins that are associated with periodicity throughout the animal king-
dom have been revealed by genetic techniques. Genes and proteins that control circadian 
rhythms have been identified and cloned in Drosophila.79 In many species, these proteins, 
one of which is known as per (period), have been observed in pacemaker regions such as 
the suprachiasmatic nucleus.66 In flies, deletion of the per gene abolishes circadian rhythm. 
Reintroduction of the per gene reestablishes the rhythm.80 Although no link has been found 
between regulatory proteins and intracellular chloride concentration, it is gratifying that 
one can now begin to explain circadian rhythms in terms of genes and ion concentrations 
in well-defined groups of neurons.

sessed by whole-cell patch recordings (not shown). The conductance change produced by GABA

SUMMARY
 
■
The autonomic nervous system regulates essential 
functions of all internal organs and is itself regulated by 
hormonal and sensory feedback.
 
■
Parasympathetic effects are focused, compared to the 
widespread effects of sympathetic activation.
 
■
ACh is the principal transmitter used for transmission in 
autonomic ganglia, at parasympathetic nerve endings, 
and at certain sympathetic nerve endings.
 
■
Norepinephrine is the principal transmitter for most 
sympathetic endings. Other transmitters include 
acetylcholine, peptides, and ATP.
 
■
A single molecule—for example, LHRH, which is also 
known as GnRH—can act as a transmitter at synapses 
and a hormone within the brain.
 
■
Analysis of effects mediated by the autonomic nervous 
system is complex, owing to the variety of receptors 
and the large numbers of peptide and nonpeptide 
transmitters.
 
■
Epinephrine released as a hormone into the circulation 
from the adrenal medulla reaches receptors in target 
cells that are not affected by transmitter released from 
nerve endings.
 
■
The hypothalamus is the region of the brain that 
controls the overall activities of the autonomic nervous 
system and also regulates the secretion of hormones.
 
■
The hypothalamus, in turn, is influenced by higher 
centers of the central nervous system and by 
hormones.

Cellular Mechanisms of Behavior 
in Ants, Bees, and Leeches
E
xperiments on invertebrates have provided crucial insights into cellular and molecular 
mechanisms of signaling. Because of their simplified nervous systems and wide diversity, 
animals such as flies, bees, ants, worms, snails, lobsters, and crayfish offer advantages for 
studying how nerve cells integrate information to produce coordinated behavior.
Ants and bees are social insects whose complex behaviors exemplify an important principle: 
measurements of behavior provide insights into integrative mechanisms. Desert ants walk and 
bees fly over long distances, taking meandering paths while foraging for food. Once it has found a 
food source, however, the ant or bee orients toward its nest and returns there directly, in a straight 
line. Somehow, the individual ant or bee calculates the position from which it started, and heads 
straight for home. This navigation requires the integration of information provided by polarized 
light from the sun. The desert ant’s eyes contain specific groups of photoreceptors for polarized 
light. These photoreceptors supply information to the CNS, which calculates and keeps track of 
movements in space to create a new vector. By contrast, bees, though closely related to ants, rely 
more on other navigational cues, including magnetic fields.
If one’s goal is to work downward from behavior via the brain to the properties and connections 
of individual neurons, neither the ant nor the bee provides an experimentally favorable preparation, 
owing to the relatively small size and large number of cells in the insect CNS. The leech, by con-
trast, provides a convenient preparation for the analysis of how behavior is generated by networks 
of neurons. This simple animal swims, crawls, selects suitable victims to feed on and makes love to 
other leeches of the same species, all directed by a CNS composed of 32 experimentally accessi-
ble ganglia. Each ganglion contains only about 400 neurons; individual sensory cells, motoneurons, 
and interneurons can be recognized by visual inspection and by direct electrical recording. Thus, in 
the leech, it is possible to: identify individual neurons from ganglion to ganglion and from one speci-
men to another; measure their biophysical properties; trace their connections; and define their roles 
in integrative actions, such as reflexes, swimming, and avoidance behavior. Each mechanosensory 
cell in the ganglion responds selectively to touch, pressure, or noxious stimulation and innervates 
a well-defined area of skin. Sensory cells transmit information to interneurons and motoneurons by 
electrical and chemical synapses. After repetitive stimulation at natural frequencies, transmission in 
sensory neurons becomes blocked at branch points where small axons feed into larger processes. 
This action temporarily alters both the receptive field of the sensory neuron and its interactions with 
synaptic partners. With circuits consisting of identified neurons, it is also possible to study how 
individual neurons form connections during development and during regeneration after injury. Ants, 
bees, and leeches exemplify the ability of invertebrate nervous systems containing relatively few 
neurons to make complex computations. Thus, these invertebrates provide appealing preparations 
for studying cellular mechanisms that underlie behavior.

Throughout this book, invertebrate neurons are used to illustrate fundamental mechanisms 
that are significant for understanding the workings of the nervous system. For example, 
principles of general validity for conduction of action potentials and for synaptic transmis-
sion were derived from the squid giant axon and giant synapse. Cells of other invertebrates 
were used to illustrate passive electrical properties and the mechanisms responsible for 
synaptic inhibition.
The reasons for choosing a particular animal to work on are often technical. Certain 
problems can be solved more easily in invertebrate nervous systems. First, although inver-
tebrate behavior may be elaborate, it is often highly stereotyped, and thus more readily 
analyzed. Second, given the relative simplicity and accessibility of many invertebrate 
nervous systems compared to vertebrates, it is often possible to recognize individual 
nerve cells and to study them by electrophysiological and molecular techniques. Third, 
the opportunities for genetic manipulations in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and 
the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans1,2 have been highly advantageous for studies 
on the development and function of the nervous system (see Chapter 25). Despite the 
divergent morphologies of the various kinds of animals, most of their genes, including 
those encoding developmental regulators, receptors, and channels are strikingly similar 
(see Chapter 5 and 25).3
From Behavior to Neurons and Vice Versa
Invertebrates provide opportunities to follow the thread of physiological mechanisms 
from the level of single cells, with their particular branching patterns and intercellular 
connections, to coordinated animal behaviors. In suitable species with large neurons, one 
can analyze the biophysical properties of single cells and observe how they give rise to the 
properties of networks of cells and to the behavior of the whole animal. Similarly, one can 
follow molecular events occurring in that cell as the animal modifies its behavior in re-
sponse to outside influences and internal programs.4,5 Such analyses are possible because 
stereotyped behavioral responses in invertebrates are performed by relatively few neurons, 
whereas analogous responses in mammals require many thousands of neurons.
In ants and bees, quantitative observation of behavior permits one to infer and then 
define underlying cellular and integrative mechanisms. The central nervous systems of 
insects have been used to study a variety of problems, including development and plastic-
ity, flight, walking, navigation, and communication by sound.6–12 The animals themselves 
and the scope of the problems are so varied that a comprehensive review is impossible. In 
subsequent chapters that deal with sensory mechanisms, perception, and motor coordination 
in the mammalian CNS, we shall see again that it is behavior (e.g., the detection of where a 
sound has arisen in space) that provides the starting point for revealing cellular mechanisms.
In addition to its advantages, each system also has its own set of disadvantages for 
analyzing the neural basis of behavior—indeed, beware the scientist who claims to have 
the ideal system! In ants and bees, individual neurons are small and hard to study physi-
ologically. Happily, cellular neurobiology of other preparations provides a complementary 
approach to the analysis that goes from behavior to brain. Here too, examples abound; 
the neural circuits for coordinated elementary units of behavior (e.g., postural reflexes, 
feeding, heartbeat, circadian rhythms, escape reactions, and swimming) have been traced 
in crustaceans, annelids, and mollusks.
The literature on crustaceans, insects, and particularly the sea slug Aplysia (which 
has been extensively studied by Kandel and his colleagues), is far too extensive to be dealt 
with in a book of this size. Indeed, entire monographs are available on these systems.13–18 
Accordingly, as in other chapters, we use selected examples for detailed discussion of cir-
cuitry and behavior. We have singled out for discussion the nervous systems of ants, bees, 
and leeches. In ants and bees, behavioral analysis is the starting point. This has revealed 
neuronal mechanisms that provide the animals with information about polarized light 
and magnetic fields in the outside world. In contrast, and of particular relevance for this 
text, the leech features more limited behaviors than do the ant or bee, and have a highly 
stereotyped CNS with fewer neurons. Thus, the leech provides preparations in which 
one can study in great detail the properties, connections, and functions of individual 
identified nerve cells.

Cellular Mechanisms of Behavior in Ants, Bees, and Leeches 357
Navigation by Ants and Bees
An essential technique for understanding the workings of the ner-
vous system is the quantitative analysis of behavior. In humans, 
key concepts that explain color vision and dark adaptation were 
first established through psychophysical experiments, in which 
mechanisms of perception were deduced from the responses of 
subjects exposed to different wavelengths or intensities of lights (see 
Chapters 1, 2, and 20). Similarly, in invertebrates, observations of 
animals under natural conditions have led to valuable insights into 
the role of receptors and of integrative mechanisms of the CNS.
The extraordinary performance of invertebrate nervous 
systems can be appreciated by considering complex navigation 
by ants,19–21 which meander over long distances searching for 
food and then unerringly find their way home. A host of sensory 
cues are needed for such navigation to be successful. Because of 
the small sizes of the nerve cells in these insects, it is often hard to 
analyze directly membrane properties and synaptic transmission. 
And yet, as the following sections show, sensory mechanisms in 
these animals can be inferred and then analyzed at the cellular 
level through insights derived from behavioral experiments.
The Desert Ant’s Pathway Home
Wehner and his colleagues have conducted experiments to analyze how desert ants, Cataglyphis 
bicolor and related species (Figure 18.1), are able to wander for long distances in search of 
food and then return toward the nest in a straight line. The principle of their experiments 
is illustrated in Figures 18.2 and 18.3.22,23 An area of desert in Tunisia around the nest and 
FIGURE 18.1 The Desert Ant, Catalglyphis bicolor, which navi-
gates successfully by means of detection of ultraviolet light. It is able 
to return home in a direct path after having searched for food. (After

is tracked as it migrates along the desert floor using a rolling opti-
cal laboratory cart to follow the ant and control the portion of sky 
it can observe. (B) The experimenter moves the cart, keeping the 
ant centered within the optical setup. The horizontal aperture (1) 
can be fitted with filters that cut out all light except ultraviolet light 
or light polarized in just one direction. A small aperture (2) sits 
atop a circular tube, and the screen (3) is used to prevent the ant 
from seeing sunlight directly. Since the cart has a frame, the little 
ant cannot see the skyline or markers on the ground and is also 
shielded from the wind. The white lines are 1 meter apart and 
are painted on the desert floor to enable the observers to track 
the ant’s progress accurately. (After Wehner, 1994b; photograph

the food supply of the ants is marked out in squares as shown in Figure 18.2. A single ant 
is then followed as it walks to the food source and back. Figure 18.3 illustrates the tortuous, 
19-minute outward path from A (nest) to B (food; each dot marks 1 minute). The journey 
home by contrast is direct, unhesitating, and accurate, and takes only about 6 minutes. 
Experiments show that the ant has integrated all the information about its movements, 
keeping track of both the angles turned (as with a compass) and the distances traveled (as 
with an odometer) as it wanders out over an area of more than 19,000 square meters (m2). 
An ant can wander for hundreds of meters in search of food, then return to within 1 meter 
(m) of its nest—an error of less than 1% (in this respect the ant is doing far better than 
at least one author of this book, who does not have the mathematical skills for making 
computations of this sort).
How does the ant do this? A first guess might be that it uses pheromones or other 
chemical signals to leave a trail that would require neither compass nor odometer to follow. 
Chemical cues are not used, however, and would in any case be inoperative at the extremely 
high (up to 45° C) desert temperatures. Spatial cues and useful landmarks do not abound 
in the desert. Although objects near the nest do indeed provide information for finding the 
nest hole at short ranges,24 objects along the pathway are not the principal cues that the ant 
uses for long-range navigation. This finding was shown by experiments in which the ant 
made the round trip while able to view only a portion of the sky.25 To eliminate the sun and 
all other cues, the experimenter walked along with the ant, pushing a cart that kept the ant 
centered under an aperture to the sky (see Figure 18.2B). Inserted into the aperture were 
filters that determined the direction, wavelength, or angle of polarization of the light seen 
by the ant through the aperture to the sky. In the absence of the sun, landmarks, and odors, 
and with only the polarization of light from the sky to guide it, the ant headed straight for 
home, as the experimenter trundled along, screening it with the little cart.
Polarization of electromagnetic radiation refers to the situation in which the electrical 
vector of an electromagnetic wave is restricted to a single plane (and the magnetic vector is 
accordingly restricted to the orthogonal plane). Light from 
the sun becomes polarized as it traverses the atmosphere, 
as we can appreciate when a properly oriented polarizing 
filter darkens the sky by blocking light polarized in a dif-
ferent direction. Light reflected from the uneven surface of 
clouds, however, is no longer polarized. Hence, the brightness 
of the clouds is much less affected by such a filter. When 
the sun is directly overhead, the pattern of polarized light 
is the same in all directions, so the pattern could not be 
used as a compass. If, however, the sun shines at any angle 
other than vertical, an asymmetric pattern of polarization 
orientations occurs, as shown in Figure 18.4. This pattern 
could in principle be used as a map for navigation. Although 
human eyes cannot detect polarized light, those of the desert 
ant can (as can other arthropods, such as bees, wasps, and 
crustaceans).26,27 The pattern of polarized light defines the 
position of the sun, whether or not it can be seen directly, 
and thus provides the required compass.
The odometer function for the pathfinding process ap-
pears to be generated by summing proprioceptive information 
associated with the locomotory movements of the ant’s legs 
(so it is a pedometer rather than an odometer!), in which each 
step is associated with covering a certain distance. This inte-
gration of locomotory information was shown by ingenious 
experiments in which the stride length of individual ants was 
altered, just as they were about to start their return journey 
to the nest. Some ants had their legs (and thus their strides) 
lengthened by gluing on stilts made of boar’s hairs; these 
ants routinely overshot the nest on the homeward journey 
before initiating the local searching movements that told the 
experimenters that the ants thought they were near home.

Conversely, ants whose legs and strides were shortened by amputation of distal leg segments 
initiated the local searching movements before they reached the vicinity of the nest.28,29
Polarized Light Detection by the Ant’s Eye
The dome-shaped compound eye of an insect consists of a multifaceted array of radially 
oriented, photo-detecting units called ommatidia—each ommatidium has its own nerve 
tract and sees the world from its own perspective.30 In ants, there are nine distinct, elongated 
photoreceptor cells (rhabdomeres) per ommatidium, some whose peak sensitivity is for green 
light and others whose peak sensitivity is for UV light. As with vertebrate photo-detection 
(see Chapter 20), the visual response in ants and other insects starts when light is absorbed 
by membrane-bound pigment molecules (rhodopsin) within closely packed arrays of sub-
cellular organelles in each rhabdomere. But in insect rhabdomeres, these organelles take the 
form of closely packed sausages (i.e., microvilli), oriented perpendicular to the long axis 
of the cell, instead of the stacks of pancakes (i.e., discs) seen in vertebrate rods and cones. 
This difference enables certain specialized ommatidia to respond preferentially to light that 
is polarized in a particular orientation. In the desert ant, these specialized ommatidia lie 
within the dorsal rim area of the eye, so they are normally oriented skyward (Figure 18.5).

Light. (A) An array of polarizing filters 
is mounted within a transparent dome 
that is oriented parallel to the horizon. 
(B) Thus, each filter is oriented toward, 
and reveals the polarization of light from, 
a different part of the sky. For a person 
standing at the equator at midday, with 
the sun shining directly overhead, the 
patterns would be completely symmetri-
cal. (C,D) Different patterns of polariza-
tion are produced with the sun at two 
different positions (indicated by the red 
dot in each panel); thus, by observing 
the pattern of polarization, an ant need 
observe only a small part of the heavens 
to compute the position of the sun and 
thereby navigate successfully. (A and

The sensitivity of these ommatidia to polarization arises from the fact that the microvilli 
are stacked precisely parallel to one another along the entire length of their UV-sensitive 
rhabdomeres (Figure 18.6). As a result, the rhodopsin molecules in the microvilli are 
arranged in uniform register with respect to the electrical vector of the incident light.31
Since rhodopsin absorbs light optimally along the long axis of the molecule, one 
particular plane of polarized light will be most effective in generating electrical signals in 
that rhabdomere. Moreover, the orientations of the microvilli in different UV-sensitive 
rhabdomeres of the dorsal rim ommatidia are aligned precisely at 90° to one another as 
shown in Figure 18.6, an arrangement seen only in those photoreceptors concerned with 
polarized light. This orthogonal arrangement of receptors in one ommatidium is optimal 
for sensing the angle of polarization, by comparing the outputs of the orthogonally oriented

receptors—a single photoreceptor on its own could not differentiate between differences of 
intensity, wavelength, and polarization. Similar arrangements of polarized light receptors 
are found in the dorsal rim of bee eyes, and in crustacean eyes.
Evidence that polarized light is essential for the ant’s navigation has been provided by 
the following experiments. First, if the eye is covered by a contact lens leaving only the dorsal 
rim exposed, the ant can still take a direct way home. Second, if the dorsal rim of the eye is 
blocked, pathfinding becomes disturbed. Third, if the pattern of polarization reaching the 
ant’s eye is shifted by appropriate filters (placed on the cart), the return course becomes 
deviated by a precise and calculable extent.
For navigation to be successful, information arriving at the eye must be correlated with a 
celestial map in which the position of the sun determines the orientations of polarized light. 
As the ant walks away from the nest, constant reference is made to the complex but regular 
pattern in the sky by the ommatidia. This provides the nervous system with information 
about distance traversed and angles. The compound eye is hemispherical, and this allows for 
a faithful spatial representation of orientations like those shown in Figure 18.4. Moreover, 
when the orientation preferences of the ommatidia are analyzed, one finds a coherent ar-
rangement that is suited to a representation in neural terms of the polarized light patterns 
of the sky. As a result, the amount of match or mismatch of the pattern of polarized light 
can be used to determine compass direction in a predictable manner (predictable for ants 
and for ant researchers).
Strategies for Finding the Nest
A further complication arises because the sun is not stationary. Hence, the ant has to com-
pensate for the shifting pattern of polarization during the day. That it can do so has been 
shown in the experiments in which an ant is placed at a spot removed from the nest at one 
hour, kept there, and then released at a later time. An ant that has become familiar with the 
sun’s rate of movement for at least one day is able to correct its trajectory in an appropriate 
manner, as though it had learned the patterns of polarized light at different times of day. In 
addition to the polarized light compass, the sun itself and external objects situated along 
the path can be used to aid navigation.32 Distinctive features of the terrain and objects are 
of principal importance in the last part of the return to the nest, which constitutes a tiny 
hole in the desert. If the homing vector has led to an error, such that the ant has not arrived 
precisely at its nest, a new strategy is introduced.25 A series of exploratory loops is made, 
increasingly larger but always returning to the starting point. This represents an optimal 
strategy for reconnoitering without getting lost.
Polarized Light and Twisted Photoreceptors 
Ants and bees are evolutionarily related—together with wasps, they comprise the order 
of insects called Hymenoptera. Thus, it is not surprising that both ants and bees navigate 
using receptors for polarized light to provide a compass. The presence of such receptors 
could, in principle, be a mixed blessing, however. On the one hand, the precise arrays of 
microvilli allow the heavens to be scanned for the orientation of polarized light, as we have 
seen. But for discriminating shapes and colors, polarization can cause difficulties. For ex-
ample, as bees fly, they need to identify flowers by their colors. Leaves and petals, however, 
vary in the way they reflect light in a manner that depends on how waxy the surfaces are. 
Leaves that are shiny reflect polarized light more than those that are matte. Consequently, 
the angle at which a leaf or a petal is illuminated and viewed will affect the amount and 
the direction of polarized light that is reflected.
The photopigments necessary for color vision in the bee are contained in microvilli 
(like those of the ant) of specific receptors sensitive to green, blue, or ultraviolet light. 
In the bee eye, as in the ant, the photopigments are arranged in precise, parallel series of 
rhabdomeres. With variable, uncalibrated contributions by polarized light, the signals 
regarding color would be ambiguous because the appreciation of color depends not only 
on wavelength but also on the relative absorption by different classes of color receptors. 
As Wehner and Bernard33 put it, “This means that for the bee the hue of a given part of 
a plant would change, whenever an approaching bee changed its direction of flight and 

362 Chapter 18
thus, its direction of view—a completely unwanted phenomenon. For example, when 
zigzagging over a meadow with all its differently inclined surfaces of leaves, the bee would 
experience pointillistic fireworks of false colors that would make it difficult to impossible 
to detect the real colors of the flowers.” To avoid this problem, the ommatidia of the bee 
outside of the dorsal rim area contain so-called twisted receptors. By light and electron 
microscopy, it was found that the rhabdomeres were twisted along their long axes. This 
twist produces a progressive change in the orientation of their microvilli (Figure 18.7), 
so that they are not in a parallel array throughout the depth of the rhabdomere. Thus, 
the receptor no longer responds selectively to polarized light. Similar irregularities of the 
microvilli arrangement are seen in ommatidia outside the dorsal rim in the ant’s eye. As 
in the bee, these ommatidia do not sense the plane of polarized light and can therefore 
be used for landmark detection.
Additional Mechanisms for Navigation by Ants and Bees
No seasoned explorer would be comfortable venturing out with just one navigation sys-
tem—Steve Wozniak, a cofounder of the Apple computer company, is reported to drive about 
with four or more GPS devices—which, in turn, requires procedures for weighing conflict-
ing information. Ants are no exception to this rule. In addition to the coupled polarization 
compass and pedometer system, the desert ant Cataglyphis can also use direct observations 
of the sun and wind in finding its path through a visually sparse environment, and it weighs

verse axis (TRA; defined in the schematics at right) of various photoreceptors against the depth 
beneath their tips. Receptors in the dorsal rim of the eye, which are sensitive to polarized light, 
show no twist (red circles). Elsewhere in the eye, photoreceptors twist either clockwise or coun-
terclockwise (blue circles), as a result of which, they do not respond selectively to any particular 
orientation of polarized light. (After Wehner and Bernard, 1993.)

these two inputs differently depending on how high the sun is in the sky.34 Similarly, ants 
inhabiting different visual environments use different sets of strategies for pathfinding.35,36
In addition to visual cues and polarized light,37,38 bees can use a magnetic compass 
to orient themselves while searching for a target. Collett and his colleagues demonstrated 
this phenomenon in experiments in which they trained bees to collect sugar from a 
small bottle cap on a board.39 For orientation, a black cylinder was placed in a constant 
compass direction at a fixed distance from the bottle cap. The cylinder and the sucrose 
were moved to different places on the board between trials. Periodically, the bottle cap 
was removed, leaving only the cylinder. The exploration of the board by a trained bee 
was monitored by video recording as it hunted for the sucrose and then returned home. 
Figure 18.8 shows the trajectory of a bee as it approached and later left the cylinder (black 
circle) and the food source (cross). What is clear is that the bee turned so as to face south 
before landing and again faced south shortly after taking off. In this way, it viewed the 
visual cue and the attractant (sugar) each time from a constant direction. Observation 
of the sky alone was not a sufficient explanation for this behavior. Bees faced south in 
the rain, under a completely overcast sky, or when the sky compass was eliminated. From 
such observations, one can conclude that somehow the animal can distinguish south 
from north, east, or west.
The fact that bees are sensitive to magnetic fields was shown by training bees under a 
tarpaulin, using imposed magnetic fields that shifted the magnetic north. The bees oriented 
themselves again to the south, but this direction was the south of the imposed magnetic 
field. How changes in imposed magnetic fields produce changes in behavior and pattern 
recognition is not known. These are sensory mechanisms not represented in our nervous 
system but present in animals such as birds, turtles, and certain invertebrates.
Without access to proprioceptive information of walking, how do bees judge the 
distance they have traveled on each leg of their flights? By analogy with the proprioceptive 
memory of the ants, one might imagine that bees count wing beats, but this would lead to

errors depending on the speed and direction of the prevailing wind. Instead, it has been 
shown that the bees use a “visually driven odometer” to judge distance. For example, in 
flying through a tunnel, they maintain their distance between the two walls by balancing the 
angular velocities of the images impinging on their left and right retinas. In an uncluttered 
visual environment, they lose their ability to judge distance.40
Neural Mechanisms for Navigation
One satisfactory aspect of the studies on insect navigation described above is the detailed 
information now available about the initial sensory mechanisms. Since each ommatidium 
of the dorsal rim contains photoreceptors sensitive to planes of polarized light at right 
angles to one another, and since each ommatidium views the sky at a different angle, the 
array of ommatidia provides information to the brain about the spatial distribution of 
polarized light vectors. Moreover, one can compute how the system behaves when chal-
lenged. In behavioral studies, objects are placed in the path so that detours must be made 
and corrected for. Another challenge is to displace the insects at different times of day or 
with different distortions of the polarized light input.
At the same time, technical challenges have so far prevented scientists from making 
the detailed recordings required to fully unravel the integrative steps performed by neu-
rons within the insect ant or bee brain. Neurons in the ant’s optic lobe are particularly 
hard to record because of their small size and the surrounding sheath is very tough. 
Thus, Labhart and colleagues studied interneurons in crickets that receive inputs from 
receptors for polarized light.41,42 As in ants and crustaceans, cricket ommatidia that are 
sensitive to the plane of polarized light contain rhabdomeres with orthogonally arranged 
microvilli—these rhabdomeres project to the interneuron, which computes informa-
tion about the vector of polarization. Electrical recordings from such cells are shown in 
Figure 18.9. Their responses are just what would be predicted from behavioral studies 
with polarized light. More recently, similar neurons have been recorded from the more 
difficult ant preparation—only six polarization-sensitive neurons could be recorded 
successfully from 40 preparations.43 Intriguingly, by a computational approach in which

robots that mimic accurately the navigational behavior of the desert ant 
using cues provided by polarized light (Figure 18.10). Still, to investigate 
the detailed links between sensory input and motor performance, we must 
turn to another system.
Behavioral Analysis at the Level of Individual 
Neurons in the CNS of the Leech
Since the days of ancient Greece and Rome, physicians have applied leeches to patients suf-
fering from anything from epilepsy, angina, tuberculosis, and meningitis to black eyes and 
hemorrhoids—an unpleasant treatment that almost certainly did more harm than good to 
the unfortunate victims. Nor was it all fun and games for the leeches—by the nineteenth 
century, use of the medicinal leech Hirudo was so prevalent that the animal became almost 
extinct in Western Europe, forcing Napoleon to import about 6 million leeches from Hun-
gary in one year to treat his soldiers. This mania for leeching had one benefit for contem-
porary biology—the ready availability of medicinal leeches facilitated basic research on 
their reproduction, development, and anatomy. In the late nineteenth century, the leech 
nervous system was extensively studied by a roster of distinguished anatomists, including 
Ramón y Cajal, Sanchez, Gaskell, Del Rio Hortega, Odurih, and Retzius.44 At about the 
same time, C. O. Whitman, one of the founders of experimental embryology, used another 
leech species to follow the fates of early embryonic cells45 (see Chapter 25). Interest in the 
leech thereafter declined, to be rekindled in 1960 when Stephen Kuffler and David Potter 
first applied modern neurophysiological techniques to its nervous system.46 This research 
set the stage for extensive studies of its circuitry and behavior,47–49 which in turn led to 
subsequent studies of leech development50,51 and regeneration,52 and of the cell biology 
or biophysics of its isolated neurons.53 Strange though it seems, in recent decades, leeches 
have reentered the realm of medicine, both as a source of novel anticoagulants and, repris-
ing their traditional role in blood letting, for the minimally invasive postsurgical treatment 
of venous congestion.54,55
With a nervous system containing only about one tenth the number of neurons of the 
insects discussed in the preceding sections, leeches still exhibit reflexes such as shorten-
ing and local bending in response to mechanical stimuli, along with behaviors involving 
coordination of the whole body, such as swimming and crawling. Leeches orient by means 
of sensory cues that allow them to access potential food sources with an efficiency that 
is the bane of those who swim or trek in leech habitat. Like other animals, leeches also 
modulate their behaviors in response to changes in physiological state and must also choose 
among mutually incompatible behaviors, such as feeding, mating, swimming, or crawling. 
Remarkable progress has been made in understanding how these processes are carried out, 
starting with the properties and connections of individual nerve cells.
Leech Ganglia: Semiautonomous Units
The body and the nervous system of the leech are segmented. That is, various tissues and 
organ systems are organized along the anterior–posterior axis into repeating units (segments) 
that are similar, though not identical, throughout the animal. The leech body contains 32 
FIGURE 18.10 Mobile Robot Known as Sahabot devised by Wehner and 
his associates. This robot is equipped with six polarized light sensors arranged 
in pairs. Each pair forms a polarization-detecting unit, with properties resembling 
those of the neuron shown in Figure 18.9. Each unit can be tuned to a specific 
direction of polarization. The robot is able to navigate with this polarized light com-
pass, successfully recreating the behavior of the ant. For example, it can be driven 
along a tortuous path and then compute the shortest way back to the starting 
point. Such models illustrate the possibility of computing trajectories in this way 
but do not, of course, provide evidence that this is the system the ant uses. (After

segments; 21 standard segments make up the midbody of the animal, 4 fused segments 
make up most of the head, and 7 fused segments make up the tail. Each midbody segment 
is innervated by a morphologically stereotyped ganglion. Even the brain-like head and tail 
ganglia shown in Figure 18.11 consist primarily of fused segmental ganglia, in which many 
characteristic features of midbody ganglia are still recognizable.56
Each ganglion contains only about 400 nerve cells,57 which have distinctive shapes, 
sizes, positions, and branching patterns, as do neurons in the periphery.58 A ganglion 
receives sensory information from, and innervates muscles and other targets in, a well-
defined territory of the body by way of paired axon bundles (roots), and it communicates 
with neighboring and distant parts of the nervous system through another set of bundles 
(interganglionic connectives). The coordinated operation of the whole nerve cord is also 
influenced by the brains at each end of the animal.
Perhaps the main appeal of the leech as a neurobiological preparation is the beauty of 
the ganglion as it appears under the microscope, with its neurons so recognizable and so 
familiar from segment to segment, specimen to specimen, and even species to species (Figure 
18.12). As one looks at these limited aggregates of cells laid out in an orderly pattern, one 
cannot but marvel at how they, on their own, being the brain of the creature, are responsible 
for all its movements, hesitations, avoidance, mating, feeding, and sensations. In addition 
to the esthetic pleasure provided by the preparation, there is the intellectual excitement 
of trying to solve the circuitry and logic of a finite, well-organized nervous system. But, 
before one can work out how the animal performs its movements, it is necessary to know 
about the individual cells: their properties, connections, and functions.

muscles that flatten the animal and fibers 
immediately under the skin that raise it 
into ridges.

Sensory Cells in Leech Ganglia
When one strokes, presses, or pinches the skin of a leech, a sequence of movements follows. 
One segment or more shortens abruptly, and the skin becomes raised into a series of distinct 
ridges. Subsequently, the animal bends, writhes, or swims away. One can reliably identify the 
individual sensory and motor cells that mediate these reflexes according to their shapes, sizes, 
positions, and electrical characteristics.59–62 Figure 18.12 shows the distribution of identified 
sensory cells, motoneurons, and interneurons in a leech ganglion. The 14 neurons labeled T, 
P, and N in Figure 18.12 are sensory cells and represent three sensory modalities. Each cell 
responds selectively to touch (T), pressure (P), or noxious (N) mechanical stimulation of the 
skin. Figure 18.13 illustrates the responses of sensory cells to various forms of cutaneous stimuli.
T cells give transient responses to light touch of the skin surface (Figure 18.13A). Their 
sensory endings consist of small dilatations situated between epithelial cells on the surface 
of the skin. T cells adapt rapidly to a small, maintained indentation (i.e., they cease firing 
within a fraction of a second). The P cells respond only to a marked pressure or deforma-
tion of the skin and show a slowly adapting discharge (Figure 18.13B). The N cells require 
still stronger mechanical stimuli, such as pinching the skin with blunt forceps (Figure 
18.13C,D). Similar to polymodal nociceptors in mammals, one or both N cells also respond 
selectively to acid, heat, and capsaicin.63 The modalities and responses of these neurons 
in leech resemble those of mechanoreceptors in the human skin (see Chapter 21), which 
distinguish among touch, pressure, and noxious or painful stimuli. In the leech, however, 
individual neurons do the job of many equivalent neurons in a densely innervated region 
of our own skin, such as the fingertip.

example, the pairs of sensory cells responding to touch 
(T), pressure (P) and noxious (N) mechanical stimulation of 
the skin are labeled, as are the annulus erector (AE) moto-
neurons outlined in the posterior part of the ganglion. Iden-
tification of other cells in the ganglion is based on more 
subtle but equally clear-cut physiological or morphological 
criteria. For example, the S cell is a small, unpaired neuron 
connected to its homologs in neighboring ganglia; S cells 
play a role in dishabituation and sensitization. (B) Each of 
the sensory cell types give distinctive action potentials. 
Impulses in T cells are briefer and smaller than those in P 
or N cells. N cell impulses have a larger afterhyperpolariza-
tion than do T or P cells. Current injected into cells through 
the microelectrode is monitored on the upper traces. (After

Figure 18.14 shows that each sensory cell innervates a defined territory, which is mapped by 
recording from a cell while applying mechanical stimuli to the skin or by labeling the cell and its 
axons with a marker, such as horseradish peroxidase.64 The boundaries of receptive fields can be 
conveniently identified in relation to landmarks such as segment borders or the coloring of skin, 
so that one can predict reliably which cells will fire when a particular area is touched, pressed, 
or pinched. One of the touch-sensitive T cells innervates dorsal skin, another ventral skin, and a 
third laterally situated skin. Similarly, the two P sensory cells divide the skin into roughly equal 
dorsal and ventral areas. The elaborate and stereotyped branching pattern of a P sensory cell 
injected with horseradish peroxidase is shown in Figure 18.14; like P, the T and N cells also send 
axons along the connectives to neighboring ganglia, and then out to minor receptive fields on 
either side of the major region of innervation.65 Curiously, while the terminal branches of an 
individual cell each supply a circumscribed area of skin with no overlap between them, endings 
from other sensory neurons of the same modality may encroach on the same territory to a limited 
extent within each segment (e.g., the dorsal and ventral P cells on one side of the ganglion overlap

FIGURE 18.14 Receptive Field of a Pressure Sensory (P) Cell. This P cell has an axon that 
runs out through the root of its own ganglion to supply the skin of the segment in which it is situ-
ated. Other axons of smaller diameter pass along the connectives to neighboring ganglia. These 
axons pass through the appropriate roots to innervate additional (minor) territories in adjacent seg-
ments. The second P cell (not shown) innervates more medial territory (i.e., closer to the ventral mid-
line) but with similar longitudinal extent. There is considerable overlap between the receptive fields 
of the two cells. Hence, pressure applied to dorsal skin will activate the P cell shown in this figure, 
pressure applied to ventral skin will activate the other P cell, and pressure applied on lateral skin will 
activate both P cells. The fact that axons with a small diameter supply the minor fields in adjacent 
segments has implications for conduction. Although pressure applied anywhere within the receptive 
field will activate action potentials, conduction can become blocked where an axon of small diam-
eter feeds into a larger-diameter axon, as at the points marked by arrows. (After Gu, 1991.)

in lateral territory) and extensively between segments (e.g., the ipsilateral ventral P cells from 
adjacent segments). We will see in the following discussion that this seemingly sloppy pattern of 
innervation is important for processing sensory information. 
In this system, which has such clear-cut boundaries in the periphery, it has also been 
possible to determine how the receptive fields become established during development and 
regeneration.58,66,67 Additional sensory cells that respond specifically to light, chemical stimuli, 
vibration, and stretch of the body wall have been found in the head and in the periphery of 
the leech.68,69
Motor Cells
The criterion for showing that a cell is indeed a motor cell is that each impulse in the cell 
gives rise to a conducted action potential in axons leading to the muscle and then to a 
synaptic potential in the muscle fiber. More than 20 pairs of motor cells (motoneurons) 
supplying the various muscles that flatten, lengthen, shorten, and bend the body as well 
as others that control the heart have been identified in the segmental ganglia (Figure 
18.15A,B).60 Muscles receive inhibitory GABAergic and modulatory peptidergic inputs as 
well as excitatory inputs that are mediated by acetylcholine. Deletion of a single cell can 
give rise to an obvious and specific deficit in behavior.70 For example, in each ganglion

there is only one annulus erector motor cell on each side (labeled AE in Figures 18.12 and 
18.15B). Impulses in this cell cause the skin of the leech to be raised into ridges like an ac-
cordion (Figure 18.15C). When one AE motor cell is killed by injecting it with a mixture 
of proteolytic enzymes (pronase) in an otherwise intact animal, the region of skin that was 
innervated exclusively by the killed cell fails to become erect in response to appropriate 
sensory stimuli. This deficit is not permanent, however. Eventually branches of other AE 
cells come to supply the denervated territory.71
Connections of Sensory and Motor Cells
In the nervous systems of invertebrates, synapses between neurons are usually situated 
not on the cell bodies but on fine processes within a central region of the ganglion (the 
neuropil).56,72–75 Synaptic potentials originating in the neuropil spread into the cell body, 
where they are recorded as excitatory and inhibitory potentials. Currents injected into 
the cell body can influence synaptic potentials and the release of transmitter. Despite its 
complexity, the neuropil is organized in an orderly manner. This fact was revealed by the 
experiments of Muller and McMahan, who devised the technique of intracellular injection 
of horseradish peroxidase, using identified nerve cells in the leech.
The branching patterns of sensory and motor cells within the neuropil are character-
istic, each cell displaying its own configuration. Examples of the typical ramifications of 
identified neurons are shown in Figure 18.16 (see also Figure 18.14). A single sensory cell 
supplies many postsynaptic targets, and its presynaptic endings are themselves supplied by

numerous terminals arising from other neurons that modulate its release of transmitters. 
Electrical synapses are observed when gap junctions form a narrow, direct cytoplasmic 
connection between neurons (see Chapter 11). Fluorescent dyes or other markers injected 
into one cell will usually cross into those cells with which it is electrically coupled (if, as with 
Lucifer yellow, the injected markers are small enough to pass through the gap junctions).
The T, P, and N sensory cells responding to mechanical stimuli make excitatory connec-
tions on the L motoneurons (called “L” because they innervate longitudinal muscles) used for 
shortening the leech. Several lines of evidence, including electron microscopy, have shown that 
the connections are direct (i.e., that there are no known intermediary cells; see Figure 18.16).76
This fact is important because only if each constituent of a circuit and its properties are known 
can one pinpoint the sites at which any interesting modifications in signaling take place.
For example, the mechanism of transmission onto the L motor cell is different for each 
type of sensory cell. The N cells act through chemical synapses (with only a hint of electrical 
coupling), the T cells through rectifying electrical synapses, and the P cells by combination of 
both mechanisms.76 The same P and N cells also make direct chemical synapses on another 
cell, the AE motoneuron. As illustrated in Figure 18.17, the differing properties of synapses 
linking specific pairwise combinations of neurons mean that the same cell may be affected 
differently by otherwise similar presynaptic inputs and that a given output from one cell can 
affect two postsynaptic targets differently. Transmitters used by leech neurons include ace-
tylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and peptides.77–81
In Hirudo and in Aplysia,82,83 as in the more complex nervous systems of vertebrates, there 
are delayed lines through interneurons that parallel the direct route and serve to coordinate 
more complex directional movements evoked by mechanical stimuli. For example, Kristan 
and his colleagues have shown that pressure applied to one side of the leech causes the animal 
to bend. The direction of the bend depends on the position of the mechanical stimulus on 
the body wall.48,84 The reflex causes the bend to be directed away from the stimulus. Due to 
the partial overlap of their receptive fields, a single stimulus will activate multiple P neurons

FIGURE 18.17 Short-Term Changes in Synaptic Plasticity between 
Sensory and Motor Neurons. (A) Chemical and electrical transmission. 
A nociceptive (N) or T cell is stimulated twice in succession, and its impulses 
are recorded (upper trace). Facilitation occurs at the chemical synapse be-
tween N and L cells, so the second impulse leads to a larger synaptic poten-
tial (facilitation; bottom left). In contrast, at the T–L synapse, no facilitation is 
seen, which is typical of electrical synapses. (B) Characteristics of transmitter 
release at different synapses made by a single presynaptic neuron. An N cell 
is stimulated and responses are recorded in L and annulus erector (AE) cells. 
Facilitation is greater at the N–AE synapse. (The small, first synaptic potential 
in the AE cell is marked by an arrow.) (C) When a train of impulses is evoked 
by stimulating the N cell at a rate of 2 per second (in elevated Ca+2), the syn-
aptic potentials in the AE cell are facilitated to more than double their original 
size, whereas those in the L cell decrease in amplitude (depression). The 
x-axis indicates the position number of the synaptic potential in the train. The 
y-axis gives the height of the synaptic potentials at each position relative to 
the average size of potentials recorded before the train (set at 100 %). (A after

and information about the stimulus position can be obtained by comparing their relative 
frequency of firing. This process provides much greater spatial resolution than could be 
obtained by an equivalent number of sensory neurons with strictly non-overlapping fields, 
and it provides a compelling rationale for the sloppiness of the overlapping fields alluded 
to above. The information coming from the various P cells in each segment is processed by 
a network of two dozen or so interneurons and feeds to about that number of excitatory 
and inhibitory motoneurons, so that bending in the appropriate direction by contracting 
certain muscles and relaxing others can occur (Figure 18.18). This motion is achieved by a 
distributed processing mechanism: each sensory cell makes excitatory inputs to many of the 
interneurons; each of those makes excitatory inputs to many of the motoneurons. Connec-
tions among the interneurons themselves are minimal and a generalized inhibition appears 
critical to the proper functioning of the reflex.
Higher Order Behavior in the Leech
Analyzing how complex behavioral acts are built up from simple, elementary reflexes is a 
major goal of neurobiology and is one scientific aim for which tractable invertebrates are par-
ticularly well suited. Another major aim is to understand, at the cellular and molecular levels, 
how experience leads to behavioral changes of the sort we commonly refer to as learning and 
memory. For example, in most animals, repetitive stimuli lead to changes in the behavioral 
responses they evoke. Thus, the reflexive withdrawal from a mild tactile stimulus becomes 
weaker if it is repeated enough times (habituation), while a strong stimulus can produce an 
overall increase in sensitivity (sensitization). The sea slug Aplysia has been useful for elucidating

rons in the leech bending reflex. When the 
skin of a leech is pressed at one point, a reflex 
bend occurs in the body so as to withdraw 
that region from the stimulus. Touch and 
pressure (P) cells convey signals to an array 
of interneurons. These in turn make excitatory 
and inhibitory connection on motoneurons. (A) 
When the P cell innervating dorsal skin is acti-
vated by pressure (arrows), longitudinal mus-
cles contract near the point of contact (from 
excitatory motoneuron inputs), while those on 
the opposite, ventral side of the body relax 
(due to inhibitory inputs). Conversely, when 
ventral skin is pressed, the ventral muscles 
contract while those on the dorsal side relax.

and ventral fields, respectively; LBI designates

are activated, by pressing simultaneously at

provided by the relative firing frequencies of 
the dorsal and ventral P cells (black vector

The leech Hirudo has been valuable for tracing the circuits by which individually identified 
cells act in concert to produce and maintain the rhythms of its heartbeat and swimming.
Habituation, Sensitization, and Conduction Block
In a simple nervous system, it is possible to identify a single neuron that plays a coordinating 
role in the behavior of an animal as a command neuron, which can initiate or orchestrate 
a particular behavioral response of the animal. This concept has been studied extensively 
in insects and crustaceans. In the leech, a complex function of this sort is well illustrated 
by a single, unpaired interneuron in each ganglion called the S cell (Figure 18.19; see also 
Figure 18.12).88 The S neuron receives excitatory inputs from touch and pressure sensory 
cells and, in turn, excites the L motoneuron, which causes shortening (as already discussed). 
Each S cell is electrically connected by a large, rapidly conducting axon to the axon of its 
homologue in the neighboring ganglion. These S-to-S junctions occur in the midregion of 
the connective, as is revealed by injecting one S cell with horseradish peroxidase or another 
high molecular marker, which cannot cross gap junctions (see Figure 18.19).
The chain of S cells is essential for adaptive types of behavior. If repeated touch stimuli 
are applied to a segment of the leech’s body wall, a reflex shortening is produced. The 
response becomes progressively weaker with each repeated touch—a process known as 
habituation (Figure 18.20).89 After a stronger stimulus that activates P (pressure) and N 
(nociceptive) cells, as well as T (touch) cells, has been applied to a different region of the 
body wall, the shortening response to touch once again becomes evident. This recovery

chemical connections of sensory touch (T), pressure 
(P), and nociceptive (N) cells as well as S cells onto 
the L motoneuron. Each ganglion contains only one 
S cell, the axons of which make electrical synapses 
with its homologs. The S cell chain modulates (but 
is not required for) rapid shortening in response 
to sensory stimuli. (B) S cell processes connect to 
processes emanating from their homologs in neigh-
boring ganglia midway along the interganglionic 
connective—by electrical synapses. The photomi-
crograph shows an interganglionic connective from 
a preparation in which the S cell whose process 
enters from the left (red) was injected with a mixture 
of Lucifer yellow (LY; yellow-green) and rhodamine-
dextran (RD; red). RD (MW greater than 10 kDA) 
cannot cross from cell to cell through electrical junc-
tions, whereas LY (MW ~0.5 kDa) can. Accordingly, 
the axon of the right-hand S cell became labeled 
with LY but not with RD. S cell axons regenerate 
and re-form their connections with very high speci-
ficity after injury. The micrograph, which resembles 
that of a normal animal, was in fact taken from a 
preparation in which the axon of one S cell had 
been severed and had re-formed its connections 
after regeneration. (After Mason and Muller, 1996,

process is known as dishabituation. Similarly, if a strong stimulus is applied without previous 
habituation, sensitization occurs; that is, the strength of the response to touch becomes 
greater than normal. The firing patterns of S cells do not change during habituation. But 
S cell connectivity is required during both sensitization and dishabituation (see Figure 
18.20). In technically difficult experiments, an S cell axon was cut or an S cell was killed in 
its entirety by injection of pronase. Killing the S cell did not interfere with shortening or 
habituation as such, but it did abolish dishabituation and sensitization.
A related series of experiments confirmed the importance of the S cell in these processes; 
in this work, the axon of a single S cell was lesioned and then allowed to regenerate. A 
remarkable property of the S cell is that after its axon is severed, it grows back to re-form

leech reflexes, and the role of the S cell. (A) Exposed ganglia connected 
to the anterior and posterior parts of the body. Stimuli are applied 
to anterior or posterior skin by electrodes or by mechanical stimuli that 
activate touch (T), pressure (P), and/or nociceptive (N) cells. Intracellular 
recordings are made from S cells, sensory cells and motoneurons, and 
muscle contractions are measured with a tension transducer. Weak, 
repetitive stimuli applied to the posterior portion of the animal give rise 
to habituation. A stronger stimulus gives rise to sensitization and to 
dishabituation. (B) Responses to weak electrical shocks to posterior 
skin. In repeated trials, the responses became smaller (habituation, red 
circles). After the fourth trial, a dishabituating strong stimulus was given 
that produced a bigger response. After killing an S cell in one segment, 
only habituation occurred (blue circles). (C) When a strong sensitizing 
stimulus was given (sensitization, red circles), the responses became 
stronger than normal instead of habituating. After elimination of the 
S cell, by killing it in one segment or by cutting its axon, sensitization 
could no longer be elicited (blue circles). Repeated stimuli gave only ha-
bituation. After a severed S cell axon had regenerated as shown in Fig-
ure 18.19, a strong stimulus once again gave rise to sensitization (green 
circles) and dishabituation (not shown). (B,C) The con trol animals were 
subjected to sham operations, i.e., the body wall was opened but the 
S cell was left intact. This experiment demonstrates that a single cell is 
essential for these complex responses. (After Sahley et al., 1994, and

its electrical connections with the target S axon with extraordinary precision.90 As expected, 
breaking the train of transmission along the S cells throughout the length of the animal 
abolished sensitization. Some weeks later, as shown in Figure 18.20, when the S cell axon 
had regenerated and re-formed its connections, sensitization once again reappeared.91
These experiments provide a clear demonstration of the way in which a single cell can 
play a part in a highly complex response, such as sensitization. In Hirudo92 and in Aplysia,4
sensitization involves serotonin.
A completely different mechanism for altering the synaptic action of one cell upon its 
postsynaptic targets is the failure of impulse conduction along axons. In the central nervous 
system of the leech and the cockroach, and in crustacean motor axons,93 repeated trains of 
action potentials occurring at natural frequencies cause conduction to fail at specific axonal 
branch points. In T, P, and N sensory neurons of the leech, the conduction block depends on 
hyperpolarization caused by the electrogenic sodium pump and by long-lasting changes in a 
calcium-activated potassium conductance. For example, repeatedly stroking or pressing the 
skin of the leech causes trains of impulses and a prolonged hyperpolarization of P sensory cells. 
As a result, propagation of impulses becomes blocked at branch points within the neuropil 
where the geometry for impulse conduction is unfavorable, that is, where a small-diameter 
axon feeds into a larger one.94 At the same time, other branches of the same neuron continue to 
transmit.95 Conduction block therefore represents a nonsynaptic mechanism that temporarily 
disconnects a P cell or a T cell from one defined set of its postsynaptic targets. When some, 
but not all, of the presynaptic fibers connected to a cell fail to conduct, transmitter release 
and the efficacy of transmission are reduced. By making lesions with a laser at specific branch 
points, Muller and his colleagues assessed the contribution made by discrete branches of the 
sensory P cell to its synaptic action on motor cells.96 An example of conduction block in a P 
cell is shown in Figure 18.21. The synaptic potentials recorded in the postsynaptic AE motor 
cell are abolished when impulses become blocked at the point marked by “X” (Figure 18.21B). 
At the same time, synaptic potentials still arise in the L motoneuron, because it receives inputs 
from other branches of the P cell in which conduction continues. Another consequence of 
conduction block is that by reducing the area of skin from which responses in the AE cell (in 
this example) are evoked, it causes temporary shrinkage of the receptive field (as viewed from 
the cell body) and thereby has the effect of improving the spatial resolution of the sensory 
neurons under conditions of prolonged stimulation.

on synaptic transmission and integration. The medi-
ally situated pressure (P) cell (innervating dorsal skin 
and similar to that shown in Figure 18.14) sends 
presynaptic axons to motor cells that cause the 
longitudinal muscles to contract (L motoneuron cell) 
and the annuli to erect (annulus erector [AE] cell). 
(A) The synaptic potentials in the L cell and the AE cell 
were evoked by stimulating the P cell intracellularly. 
Similarly, when impulses originate in the neighboring 
segments at very low frequency, they travel along the 
small axons in the connective, invade all the branches 
of the P cell, and produce synaptic potentials in the 
AE and L cells. (B) When the skin in the next most 
anterior segment is pressed so that P-cell impulses 
arise there at higher frequency, the P cell becomes 
hyperpolarized and impulse conduction fails at the 
point labeled X. When this occurs, the L cell still 
receives its input and produces a synaptic potential, 
but the AE cell is temporarily disconnected (arrow). 
(C) Conversely, when the posterior field is stimu-
lated so as to generate higher frequency impulses, 
they become blocked at Y, where the small axons 
encounter the larger axon. Once, again cells become 
disconnected (arrow). This time, however, it is the 
L cell that fails to show a synaptic potential, while the 
AE cell continues to respond. (After Gu, 1991.)

Conduction block represents an example of how work on a mammalian nervous system 
can be applied to understand an invertebrate—the opposite of what is so often claimed for 
research on simpler animals. The first description of conduction block was made by Bar-
ron and Matthews in 1935,97 in their experiments on dorsal root axons of the mammalian 
spinal cord. Their results were largely forgotten, and only much later was conduction block 
rediscovered in invertebrates. It is now apparent that conduction block is a key feature of 
integrative mechanisms in dendrites in mammalian CNS.98
Circuits Responsible for the Production of Rhythmical Swimming
Leeches swim forward in a serpentine manner, with their dorsal surface uppermost (Figure 
18.22A). As in vertebrates (see Chapter 14), biogenic amines play a role in modulating mo-
tor activity.80,99–101 Quiescent (sluggish!), non-swimming leeches have lower blood levels

FIGURE 18.22 Locomotory Behaviors of the Leech. (A) In swimming, the leech releases its 
anterior sucker from the substrate, extends the body forward, and flattens dorsoventrally to gen-
erate a blade-shaped profile; then, it releases the posterior sucker and propels itself through the 
water by passing a wave of rapidly alternating dorsal and ventral flexures from front to back. (B) In 
vermiform (as opposed to inchworm style) crawling, the animal releases its front sucker and then 
reaches forward by simultaneously relaxing its longitudinal muscles and contracting its circular 
muscles to extend the hydrostatic skeleton. After extending, the front sucker attaches and the 
rear sucker detaches. The animal then shortens by contracting its longitudinal muscles and relax-
ing its circular muscles, and finally reattaches the rear sucker to complete the cycle. The alternat-
ing cycles of extension and contraction also progress from front to back. (A after Stent 
et al., 1978; B after Kristan, Calabrese, and Friesen, 2005.)

of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) than do active leeches. Moreover, stimula-
tion of identified cells (known as Retzius cells) that secrete 5-HT promotes an increase in 
its concentration in the blood and promotes swimming in the animal as well. The level of 
5-HT can be lowered in embryos by means of a specific chemical (5,7-dihydroxytrypta-
mine or 5,7-DHT) that selectively destroys the 5-HT neurons in the developing ganglia. 
After development, adult leeches treated in this way, and thereby depleted of serotonin, 
do not swim spontaneously, but they will do so if immersed in a weak solution of 5-HT.
Which neurons initiate, coordinate, and maintain the swim rhythm? This problem was 
first studied by Stent, Kristan, Friesen, and their colleagues.102 The head and tail ganglia of 
the leech are not essential for generating the swim rhythm, which can occur in a few isolated 
segments or even a single segment of the animal. As in other invertebrates (e.g., the cockroach, 
locust, and cricket), in which central motor programs involving a small number of individual 
cells have been shown to control complex patterns of movement, the swim rhythm in the leech 
is established by inhibitory and excitatory synaptic interactions within the CNS. Peripheral 
receptors serve to trigger, enhance, depress, or halt leech swimming. Similarly, mammalian CNS 
preparations isolated from the body generate the respiratory rhythm in vitro (see Chapter 24).
A key to the successful analysis of swimming behavior in leech was the development 
of a semi-intact preparation, in which a single, midbody ganglion was exposed and im-
mobilized for electrical recordings, attached to the free-moving anterior and posterior ends 
of the animal by only the intersegmental connectives. This preparation allowed Kristan, 
Stent, and colleagues to record from individual neurons and from the segmental nerves 
in the exposed ganglion while the two ends of the animal were demonstrably swimming. 
The fact that the ends could maintain coordinated swim movements also demonstrated 
that the CNS was sufficient for coordinating swim movements, without the need for any 
peripheral nerve net. A similar approach was used to characterize the very differently co-
ordinated interneuron circuitry and motor outputs associated with the crawling behavior 
of the leech (Figure 18.22B). In this case, the free moving anterior and posterior suckers 
of the semi-intact preparation were allowed to attach to a floating ping-pong ball and turn 
it like a trained circus elephant.103
To Swim or to Crawl? Neurons that Determine 
Behavioral Choices in the Leech
The analysis of neural circuits eliciting swimming and crawling behavior showed that 
many of the same interneurons are involved in controlling both behaviors.104 Similarly, 
studies from another carefully examined invertebrate system, the crustacean stomatogastric 
ganglion,105–108 show that specific interneurons may be involved in generating multiple, 
distinct patterned movements.
This finding highlights the question of how animals, including ourselves, choose 
between mutually incompatible behaviors. Briggman, Kristan, and colleagues were able 
to address this question in terms of the activity of individually identified neurons in the 
leech, taking advantage of further refinements in behavioral analysis and modern optical 
recording methods.109
One important breakthrough was the ability to observe and elicit swimming or crawl-
ing behavior in fully isolated nerve cords (Figure 18.23A). Of course, no behavior of the 
animal as a whole occurs in these experiments, since most of the body has been removed. 
Nevertheless, from semi-intact preparations, it is possible to categorize fictive behavior of 
isolated nerve cords by recording the interneuron and motor patterns in various segments 
and how they are coordinated between segments. Moreover, it is possible to elicit these 
behaviors by administering mild shocks to a single segmental nerve, equivalent to stimulat-
ing the axons of a defined set of T and P neurons. A particular regimen was established in 
which an identical stimulus would elicit either fictive swimming or fictive crawling with 
roughly equal probabilities across multiple trials. How did the leech, in essence, decide
which behavior to undertake?
This question was addressed by the combined use of optical methods and a systems 
approach to analyze the electrical activity patterns of many individual neurons in parallel. 
In multiple trials, shocks were applied to a segmental nerve extending from one ganglion in

FIGURE 18.23 To Swim or to Crawl? Choosing between mutually 
exclusive behaviors in leech. (A) Schematic shows an isolated nerve 
cord. The interconnected, segmental organization of the leech nerve 
cord makes it possible to stimulate electrically in one segment (G15) 
to elicit behavior, monitor activity of one or more neurons by recording 
in another segment (G13), and then use optical methods to moni-
tor the activity of large populations of neurons in a third segment 
(G8). Fictive behavior in isolated nerve cord preparations (validated 
by intermediate studies of semi-intact preparations) allowed Kristan 
and colleagues to study how the CNS generates appropriate pat-
terns of motoneuron activity for different behaviors. In the examples 
shown here, the activity of the dorsal excitor (DE) motoneuron in G13 
is detected as the largest spikes in extracellular recordings from the 
segmental nerve innervating the dorsal body wall. In the top trace, 
bursts of DE activity correspond to what would be a dorsal flexure 
of segment 13 during an episode of swimming. In the bottom trace, 
longer lasting, less frequent bursts correspond to what would be seen 
as the phases of longitudinal contraction (C) alternate with phases of 
extension (E) during an episode of crawling. Stimulation elicited either 
fictive swimming or fictive crawling with equal probability over multiple 
trials. (B) In the same preparation, the simultaneous activity of large 
numbers of neurons in G8 was monitored optically, using a charge-
coupled device (CCD) camera and voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes. 
The changes in membrane potential for each neuron were color-
coded (red = depolarized; blue = hyperpolarized), and the data for 
elicited swim and crawl behavior were pooled separately for further 
analysis. Black vertical lines indicate the duration of the stimulus. (A

the isolated nerve cord (as schematized in Figure 18.23A). The elicited behavioral response 
(swimming or crawling) was monitored by recording the motor output from the segmental 
nerve of a second ganglion. Simultaneously, the activity of more than 100 individual neurons 
in a third ganglion was analyzed (using voltage-sensitive dyes and a digital camera), focus-
ing on the interval of jumbled neuronal activity after stimulation but before initiation of 
the motor program (Figure 18.23B). This interval represented the time during which the 
isolated nerve cord was deciding whether to swim or to crawl. Using a systems approach 
(Figure 18.24A), they identified several candidate neurons, whose activity correlated with 
the swim/crawl outcome (Figure 18.24B). 
Then, in the same preparation they carried out further trials in which just one repre-
sentative of one class of candidate neuron (cell 208, in just a single ganglion) was either 
hyperpolarized or depolarized at the time of stimulation. Remarkably, this minor per-
turbation biased the outcome of the swim/crawl trials (see Figure 18.24C). Imagine that 
there is a single neuron or ensemble of neurons in your brain, for which the differences 
in activity levels from one morning to another affects your choice between putting orange 
marmalade or strawberry jam on your toast at breakfast. It is not that such neurons do 
or do not exist, but one cannot imagine being able to identify them through a systematic 
experimental approach.

FIGURE 18.24 Biasing the Swim-Crawl Decision (A) Viewed in abstrac-
tion, the overall state of activity of the ganglion at each instant during a swim/
crawl trial can be represented by a point along a trajectory in an N-dimen-
sional space, with each dimension corresponding to the activity of one of the 
optically recorded neurons (143 in this experiment). Using a mathematical 
process known as principal component analysis (PCA), a new space is formu-
lated in which as much of the trajectory as possible is restricted to just three 
of the 143 possible dimensions (principal components 1–3 = PC1, PC2, PC3; 
left panel), by taking different linear combinations of the activities of different 
neurons. Thin lines plot the individual trajectories of the swim (blue) and crawl 
(red) trials, and thick lines indicate the average of the swim and crawl trajec-
tories, respectively. The green line highlights an exceptional case in which the 
preparation started out along a typical swim trajectory, but then deviated to 
exhibit fictive crawling. Further analysis permitted the calculation of a linear 
discriminant (long black arrow), corresponding to the point at which the aver-
age swim and crawl average trajectories diverged. (B) Mapping the weighting 
factors for each neuron in the linear discriminant back onto the ganglia data 
set revealed cell 208 (arrow) as a candidate for biasing the choice between 
swimming and crawling in response to stimulation. (C) Consistent with the 
mapping, hyperpolarizing or depolarizing a single cell 208 in the chain of 
ganglia sufficed to bias the response to stimulation to a statistically significant 
degree. (After Briggman, Abarbanel, and Kristan, 2005.)

Why Should One Work on Invertebrate Nervous Systems?
Throughout this book, and from the examples described in this chapter, it is evident that 
invertebrate nervous systems have been essential for approaching problem after problem 
relating to the biophysics, cell biology, and development of nerve cells. Particularly striking 
is the conservation of fundamental mechanisms in species after species through evolution. 
Often, experiments on an invertebrate have produced the very insight needed for starting 
the investigation of similar problems in a mammal. For example, a great impetus for the 
development of the slice technique for mammalian brain came from the work on inverte-
brate ganglia in which identified neurons could be seen directly in the microscope as they 
were impaled. Hartline’s work on the horseshoe crab eye110 provided the key stimulus for 
Kuffler’s experiments on the cat retina.111 At the same time it would be futile to hope to 
understand how the visual cortex of a monkey carries out its functions from studies made 
on an invertebrate.
What then is the point of studying, say, navigation by ants or bees? First, one can guess 
that even though we do not see polarized light or sense magnetic fields, the underlying 
principles for analyzing sensory information and translating it to an effective output 
will be used again in higher nervous systems, in one way or another. Second, the work 
on invertebrates illustrates a fundamental attitude toward biology—neurobiology is not 
restricted to the study of the brain (i.e., ours). Rather, there is an inherent fascination in 
trying to understand how the tiny, finite brain of an invertebrate can do wonderful and 
sophisticated computations that are essential for its survival. The way in which a leech 
swims, an ant navigates, a bee dances, a sea slug learns, a cricket sings, or a fly flies are all 
problems of interest in their own right.112

SUMMARY
 
■
The properties of individual neurons and glia are similar 
between vertebrates and invertebrates. However, 
invertebrate nervous systems generally have far fewer 
cells and correspondingly simpler organizations than 
those of vertebrates.
 
■
Correlated with their comparative simplicity, 
invertebrate behaviors, though tremendously 
sophisticated, are often more stereotyped than those 
of vertebrates and thus more amenable to study. 
Quantitative measurements of these behaviors shed 
light on fundamental principles in neurobiology.
 
■
Ants and bees routinely carry out remarkable 
navigational feats using multiple sensory systems 
in parallel, including visual cues, the direction of 
polarization of light, and the ability to orient with respect 
to an external magnetic field. For measuring distance, 
however, ants rely on proprioceptive processing to 
measure the steps traveled, while bees do so by 
integrating the flow of visual information across their 
retinas.
 
■
In the leech Hirudo and some other invertebrate 
preparations, much or all of the nervous system 
consists of relatively large, identified, experimentally 
accessible cells. In such preparations, it is possible 
to analyze behaviors—ranging from simple reflexes to 
higher order behaviors, such as learning and decision 
making—at the level of individual cells and synapses.
 
■
The study of the invertebrate central nervous systems 
is fascinating in its own right and need not be directed 
toward understanding mechanisms in human brain.

■ PART V
Sensation and Movement
In this section we examine the mechanisms by which the brain acquires, 
analyzes, and acts upon information from the environment. Different forms of 
stimulus energy are converted (transduced) into electrical signals by specific 
sensory organs, receptor cells, and molecular mechanisms. The general 
principles of sensory transduction are described in Chapter 19. Mechano-
transduction by sensory hair cells provides an example of relatively direct 
gating of ion channels by a stimulus to generate receptor potentials. In con-
trast, olfactory neurons are excited when chemicals from the environment 
bind to a G protein–coupled receptor, opening cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion 
channels by way of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase to synthesize cyclic AMP. 
Enzymatic transduction of stimulus energy also takes place in retinal photo-
receptors, as described in Chapter 20, with the striking difference that pho-
toreceptors are hyperpolarized when light causes a drop in the level of cyclic 
nucleotides. This chapter also explains the functional organization of the 
retina that leads from the relatively straightforward response of the photore-
ceptor to the requirements of retinal ganglion cells for contrasting patterns of 
light to be transmitted centrally.
Touch, pain, and texture sensation result from the activity of specific classes 
of receptor neurons that innervate skin, as described in Chapter 21. The tac-
tile whiskers on the muzzle of rodents provide a prominent example of so-
matotopic mapping of the cortex, as well as the segregated analysis of stim-
ulus features. The same organizational principles apply to sensory signaling 
from the inner ear (Chapter 22), although here the specialized construction 
of the end-organ confers unique stimulus qualities, such that the primary au-
ditory cortex is mapped as an acoustic frequency gradient. 
A central challenge in neurobiology is to understand the connection between 
transduction in the sensory periphery and the resulting behavior. Chapter 23 
moves from primary sensory cortex to higher-order areas where meaning 
might emerge from the appropriate combination of stimulus features. Finally, 
in Chapter 24 the mechanisms of movement are described, ranging from 
the organization of stretch reflexes, to the genesis of anticipatory motor pro-
grams that establish sensory set points appropriate for the upcoming move-
ment. While much between sensation and movement remains a black box, 
these chapters show that the box is getting smaller.


■ CHAPTER 19
Sensory Transduction
S
timulus intensity and timing are encoded in receptor potentials arising in the receptive end-
ings of sensory cells. Receptor potentials can be depolarizing or hyperpolarizing; they in-
crease in amplitude with increased stimulus intensity and saturate at higher stimulus levels. 
During sustained stimulation, the receptor potential adapts to a lower level. Adaptation can occur 
quickly or slowly. It arises from mechanical, electrical, or biochemical processes in different cell 
types. Receptors that adapt slowly can better encode stimulus duration. Rapidly adapting recep-
tors are specialized to detect changes in the stimulus.
Transduction can be very direct, as in the conversion of sound or head movement by mecha-
nosensory hair cells. Here, the stimulus energy directly alters the gating probability of mecha-
nosensitive ion channels in the sensory hair bundle. Such direct transduction is fast and makes 
possible hearing at high frequencies. In comparison, indirect mechanisms of transduction rely on 
biochemical cascades. These are inherently slower than channel gating, but can greatly increase 
sensitivity through amplification at each step. For example, odor molecules (olfactants) bind to a 
large family of G protein–binding receptors in ciliated olfactory sensory neurons in the nose. 
A subsequent rise in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) causes many cation channels to 
open, and the resulting depolarization generates action potentials. 
Stimulus modality depends on a combination of direct and indirect transduction mechanisms. 
For example, certain taste stimuli (amino acids, sugar, and bitter compounds) are transduced by 
G protein–coupled membrane receptors in taste buds. Again, a rise in cAMP causes cation chan-
nels to open, and action potentials are initiated. But also, salts and acids (sour taste) can act direct-
ly on ion channels in some taste receptor cells. The transduction of painful stimuli in tissues results 
from both direct mechanical and indirect biochemical mechanisms of transduction as well as from 
sensitization by substances released from damaged cells, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP).

386 Chapter 19
We know the physical world through our senses. We reach out to touch nearby objects, 
and we receive other signals transmitted from afar. Neuronal sensory receptors are the 
gateways through which these signals pass. Right at the outset, receptors set the stage for 
all the analyses of sensory events that are subsequently made by the central nervous system 
(CNS). They define the limits of sensitivity and determine the range of stimuli that can be 
detected and acted upon. With rare exceptions, each type of neuronal receptor is specialized 
to respond preferentially to only one type of stimulus energy, called the adequate stimulus. 
For instance, rods and cones in the eye respond to light (see Chapter 20); nerve endings in 
the skin to touch, pressure, or vibration; and receptors in the tongue to chemical tastants. 
The stimulus, whatever its modality, is always converted (or transduced) to an electrical 
signal—the receptor potential. In general, the strength and duration of a stimulus are 
coded in electrical signals; recognition by the CNS of the modality of the stimulus and its 
position depend on the nature of the sensory ending and its anatomical location. Thus, a 
temperature receptor in the foot has its own pathway into the nervous system that is quite 
distinct from that of a vibration receptor in the hand, but in both axons, the communica-
tion is by action potential trains of variable frequency and duration.
For sensory stimuli, there is a great deal of amplification at the receptor level, so 
that very small external changes provide a trigger to release stored charges that appear 
as electrical potentials. For example, only a few molecules of specific odorant substances 
(pheromones) are sufficient to act as sex attractants for moths. Similarly, a few quanta of 
light trapped by receptors in the retina are sufficient to produce a visual sensation. This 
extreme sensitivity extends to the inner ear, where mechanical displacements of 10–10
meters (m) are detectable.1 Equally remarkable are electroreceptors in some fish that 
can detect electrical fields of a few nanovolts per centimeter.2,3 This signal is similar in 
magnitude to the field that would be produced if two wires connected to either pole of 
an ordinary flashlight battery could be dipped into the Atlantic Ocean—one at Bordeaux, 
the other at New York!
Sensory receptors have a well-defined range of stimuli to which they respond. For 
example, our auditory hair cells respond to sounds only within a bandwidth of about 20 to 
20,000 Hz. The response by receptors in our retina to electromagnetic radiation is restricted 
to wavelengths between about 400 and 750 nanometers (nm). Shorter (near-ultraviolet) 
and longer (near-infrared) wavelengths go undetected. Restrictions of this kind are not 
usually because of unavoidable physical limitations. Instead, each system is tuned to the 
particular needs of the organism—whales and bats can hear much higher frequencies; 
snakes can detect infrared, and bees ultraviolet, radiation. For dogs and pigs, the sense of 
smell is more refined than in humans.
What mechanisms provide such great sensitivity and selectivity to sensory receptor cells? 
These vary according to the stimulus and receptor type. We will describe mechanotransduc-
tion by stretch receptors of muscle, touch receptors in skin, and hair cells of the inner ear in 
which mechanosensitive ion channels directly transduce the stimulus. In distinction to the 
direct impact of the physical stimulus on ion channels in hair cells, chemotransduction in 
olfactory neurons operates through G protein–coupling to an olfactory receptor protein, 
while gustation employs multiple mechanisms, some G protein–coupled and others that are 
more direct. We conclude with a discussion of nociception that underlies pain sensation and 
combines the transduction of chemical and mechanical stimuli. The detailed mechanisms 
underlying phototransduction are treated separately in Chapter 20.
Stimulus Coding by Mechanoreceptors
Short and Long Receptors
The receptor potential generated by the transduction process reflects the intensity and dura-
tion of the original stimulus. In some receptors, such as retinal rods and inner ear hair cells 
that do not have long axons, receptor potentials spread passively from the sensory region to 
the synaptic pole of the cell (Figure 19.1A). Such receptors are known as short receptors. 
The passage of information from the receptor end to the synaptic end of the cell does not 
require the intervention of action potentials. In some cells, passive spread of the receptor 
potential can reach a surprisingly distant point. For example, in some crustacean4 and

Sensory Transduction 387
leech5 mechanoreceptors, and in photoreceptors in the barnacle eye,6 the receptor potential 
spreads passively over a distance of several millimeters. In such cells the membrane resis-
tance, and hence the length constant for spread of passive depolarization, is unusually high.
Whereas receptor potentials are usually depolarizing, certain short receptors respond 
to their adequate stimulus with a hyperpolarizing potential change. This action occurs, 
for example, in photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina and in cochlear hair cells that have 
both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses. Whatever the polarity of the receptor 
potential, short receptors release neurotransmitter tonically from their synaptic regions, 
with depolarization increasing and hyperpolarization decreasing the rate of release.
In long receptors (Figure 19.1B), such as those in skin or muscle, information from 
single receptors must be sent over a much greater distance to reach the second-order sensory 
cell (e.g., from the big toe to the spinal cord). In order to accomplish this relay, the receptor 
performs a second transformation process in which receptor potentials give rise to trains 
of action potentials whose duration and frequency code information about the duration 
and intensity of the original stimulus. These impulses then carry the information to the 
synaptic terminals of the cell.
The frequency code for stimulus intensity is established through the interaction of 
the maintained receptor current from sensory terminals and the conductance changes 
associated with the action potential. At the end of each action potential, the increased 
potassium conductance that occurs on the recovery phase drives the membrane in the 
hyperpolarizing direction, toward EK (the potassium equilibrium potential). This increase 
in potassium conductance is transient, while the sustained transduction current depolarizes 
the membrane once more to the firing level. The stronger the receptor current, the sooner 
the firing level again is reached, and the higher the impulse frequency. Similar considerations 
apply to all neurons in which synaptic input, rather than a receptor potential, sums to alter 
the frequency of action potentials.
Encoding Stimulus Parameters by Stretch Receptors
The way in which sensory receptors generate electrical signals was studied early on by Adrian 
and Zotterman7 using extracellular recording from sensory nerve fibers arising in verte-
brate muscle stretch receptors. Katz was the first to demonstrate the link between sensory 
stimuli and electrical signals in a mechanoreceptor,8 when he recorded receptor potentials 
and showed that stretch caused a depolarization of the sensory ending. When the receptor 
potential was observed in isolation by blocking the nerve discharge with procaine (a local 
anesthetic), its amplitude could be seen to increase in a graded fashion with muscle stretch.

Thus, receptor potentials generated within the sensitive ending spread effectively throughout the 
cell, altering transmitter release at synaptic areas. (B) Long receptors, such as muscle spindle af-
ferents and cutaneous mechanoreceptors, employ action potentials to conduct their signals to a 
distant second-order neuron. The amplitude of the receptor potential is encoded in the frequency 
of action potentials it generates.

Figure 19.2 shows the relationship between receptor potential amplitude and stretch. 
The function begins with a slope of roughly 0.1 mV (extracellular recording) per millimeter 
of stretch, but flattens out at higher levels. Thus, the sensitivity of the sensory ending, in 
millivolts per millimeter of stretch, decreases as the stimulus grows. Many sensory receptors 
take advantage of this nonlinear relationship to provide amplitude coding over a wider range 
of stimulus intensities. In these receptors the response amplitude continues to increase, 
but in proportion to the logarithm of stimulus intensity. This effect is of great utility in 
receptors, such as hair cells and photoreceptors, that respond to stimuli whose amplitudes 
vary by several orders of magnitude.
These relationships between stimulus intensity and sensitivity correspond to those first 
described in 1846 by Weber. He measured the ability of subjects to discriminate weights held 
in their two hands and showed that it varied in proportion to the size of the weights. That is, 
the subjects were just able to detect a 3 gram (g) difference between weights of about 100 g 
each, whereas kilogram weights had to differ by 30 g (in each case, the detectable difference 
was about 3% of each object’s weight). Fechner formalized this relationship by pointing 
out that this result implied a logarithmic relationship between stimulus and response. The 
Weber–Fechner law9 is one formulation of the nonlinear relationship between stimulus 
strength and sensation. Although the exact form of the relationship depends on stimulus 
modality, this process applies to many aspects of perception and behavior. (For example, 
we might pinch pennies when choosing a pencil, but happily spend hundreds of dollars 
more for a classier computer.)
The Crayfish Stretch Receptor
Stimulus coding was analyzed in detail in crayfish stretch receptors by Eyzaguirre and Kuf-
fler.10 This preparation is particularly useful because the cell body of the stretch receptor 
lies in isolation—not in a ganglion, but on its own in the periphery, where it can be seen 
in live preparations (Figure 19.3A). It is large enough for penetration by intracellular mi-
croelectrodes. The cell inserts its dendrites into a nearby muscle strand and sends an axon 
centrally to a segmental ganglion (Figure 19.3B). In addition, the receptor receives inhibitory 
innervation from the ganglion; the muscle fibers into which it inserts receive excitatory and 
inhibitory innervation. Thus, receptor sensitivity is regulated by the central nervous system.
There are two types of crustacean stretch receptors with distinct structural and physi-
ological characteristics, and their dendrites are embedded in different types of muscle. One 
responds well at the beginning of a stretch, but its response quickly wanes. This decrease 
in response to a steady stimulus is called adaptation. In contrast to the rapidly adapting
receptor, the second type is slowly adapting; that is, its response is well maintained dur-
ing prolonged stretch. The responses of a rapidly adapting and a slowly adapting stretch 
receptor are shown in Figure 19.4. In the slowly adapting receptor (Figure 19.4A), mild

stretch of the muscle produces a depolarizing receptor potential of about 5 mV, lasting for 
the duration of the stretch. A larger stretch produces a larger potential that depolarizes the 
cell to above threshold and produces a train of action potentials that propagate centrally 
along the axon. A similar stretch of the muscle produces only transient responses in the 
rapidly adapting receptor (Figure 19.4B).
Muscle Spindles
Stretch receptors in mammalian skeletal muscles show mechanisms of action similar to 
those in crustaceans. Such stretch receptors were called muscle spindles by early anato-
mists because of their resemblance to the spindles used by weavers. (Muscle fibers within

the spindle are called intrafusal fibers after the Latin word for “spindle,” fusus.) Figure 19.5 
illustrates schematically the sensory apparatus of spindles in leg muscles of the cat. The 
spindle consists of a capsule containing 8 to 10 intrafusal fibers. In the central, or equatorial, 
region there is in each fiber a large aggregation of nuclei. Their arrangement provides the 
basis for the classification of intrafusal fibers as bag or chain fibers, depending on whether 
the nuclei are grouped together centrally or are arranged linearly.
Two types of sensory neurons innervate each muscle spindle. The larger nerve fibers, 
group Ia afferents, have diameters of 12 to 20 micrometers (μm) and conduct impulses at 
velocities up to 120 m/s. (For a summary of the fiber classifications referred to here and 
elsewhere, see Chapter 8.) Their terminals are coiled around the central parts of both bag 
and chain fibers to form the primary endings. Smaller sensory nerves (Group II fibers) are 
4 to 12 μm in diameter and conduct more slowly. They contact chain fibers, where they 
form secondary endings. The muscle spindle also is innervated by motoneurons (fusimotor 
fibers, or γ-motoneurons). They cause intrafusal fibers to contract and thereby stretch the 
central nuclear region where the sensory endings are situated, causing them to fire impulses. 
This interaction provides a mechanism for the efferent control of muscle spindle sensitivity 
that will be described in Chapter 24.
Responses to Static and Dynamic Muscle Stretch
When a rapid stretch is applied to a muscle and to the spindles within it, receptor potentials 
and bursts of impulses arise in group Ia and II sensory fibers. There is, however, a clear 
difference in the characteristics of the discharges in the two endings (Figure 19.6). The 
primary endings, connected to the larger group Ia axons, are sensitive mainly to the rate 
of change of stretch. The frequency of discharge is therefore maximal during the dynamic

phase, while stretch is increasing, and it subsides to a lower steady level while the stretch 
is maintained. The secondary endings, connected to the smaller group II fibers, are rela-
tively unaffected by the rate of stretch but are sensitive to the level of static tension.11 The 
group Ia (dynamic) and group II (static) afferents are analogous to the rapidly adapting 
and slowly adapting receptors in the crayfish muscle and in other sensory systems.
Mechanisms of Adaptation in Mechanoreceptors
In muscle spindles, the viscoelastic properties of intrafusal fibers allow a gradual decrease 
in deformation of the sensory terminals.12 A variety of processes have been shown to 
contribute to adaptation of crustacean stretch receptors.11,13–15 In the slowly adapting 
stretch receptor, trains of impulses lead to an increase in internal sodium concentration 
and activation of the sodium pump. The net outward transport of positive charges by the 
pump reduces the amplitude of the receptor potential and hence the discharge frequency. 
Yet another factor contributing to adaptation is an increase in potassium conductance. For 
example, during a train of impulses in crayfish stretch receptors, calcium entry through 
voltage-activated channels causes the opening of calcium-activated potassium channels. 
The effect of this increase in potassium conductance is to “short out” the receptor potential, 
reducing its amplitude and the frequency of the sensory impulses. The rapidly adapting 
crayfish stretch receptor shows prompt adaptation of its firing rate even when a steady 
depolarizing current is applied experimentally. During imposed stretch, calcium influx 
through the transduction channels activates nearby calcium-dependent potassium chan-
nels to hyperpolarize the cell.16
Adaptation in the Pacinian Corpuscle
The Pacinian corpuscle is a rapidly adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptor17 whose sensory 
terminal is enclosed in an onion-like capsule. Pressure applied slowly to the capsule produces 
no response at all; more rapidly applied pressure produces only one or two action potentials. 
However, the receptors are exquisitely sensitive to vibration up to frequencies of 1000/s. Al-
though they are found generally in subcutaneous tissue, they are particularly common around 
footpads and claws of mammals, and in the interosseus membranes bridging the bones of 
the leg and forearm, where they act as sensitive detectors of ground vibration.18 A similar 
structure, the Herbst corpuscle, is found in the legs, bills, and cutaneous tissue of birds (and in 
the tongues of woodpeckers!). Speculation about their physiological function includes detec-
tion by the duck’s bill of aquatic vibrations due to small prey and, in soaring birds, detection 
of vibration of flight feathers due to improper aerodynamic trim.19 In Chapter 21, we will 
describe the role of Pacinian corpuscles in the fingertip in sensing texture.
The mechanism of adaptation in the Pacinian corpuscle was studied in detail by Wer-
ner Loewenstein and his associates, who showed that it was due, in part, to the dynamic 
mechanics of the capsule.20 When a mechanical pulse was applied to an isolated, intact 
corpuscle, a brief receptor potential appeared at the onset and withdrawal of the pulse 
(Figure 19.7A). The responses to sustained pressure are transient because compression 
of the sensitive ending is relieved by redistribution of fluid within the capsule. After the

capsule was stripped carefully from the nerve ending, the receptor potential decayed only 
slowly during the pulse (Figure 19.7B). Nonetheless, even when the receptor potential was 
prolonged, there was still only a brief burst of action potentials in the afferent axon (not 
shown); that is, the properties of the axon itself are matched to those of the intact receptor. 
Such intrinsic adaptation is likely to involve ionic mechanisms like those described in the 
crayfish stretch receptor. 
Direct Transduction by Mechanosensory Hair Cells 
It is apparent that there must be stretch-sensitive ion channels localized to mechano-
sensory nerve terminals—the sites of receptor potential generation. Furthermore, those 
transduction channels must differ from the channels that support the action potential, 
since stretch-evoked receptor potentials continue in the presence of a local anesthetic that 
blocks conduction. Mechanosensitive ion channels are found in a wide variety of cell types 
and organs, including endothelial cells of blood vessels, baroreceptors in the carotid sinus, 
touch and pressure receptors in the skin, muscle stretch receptors, and mechanosensitive 
hair cells of the inner ear.21–23
By voltage clamp it has been shown that the current underlying the receptor potential 
in crayfish stretch receptors is associated with an increase in permeability to sodium and 
potassium,24,25 as well as to divalent cations26 and to larger organic cations such as tris (tris 
[hydroxymethyl] amino methane) and arginine. The increase in conductance produced by 
stretch is unaffected by tetrodotoxin27 but can be altered by some local anesthetics.28 Recep-
tor potentials in vertebrate muscle spindles also are due to increased cation permeability.29
Single channels activated by membrane distortion were first observed in membrane 
patches from embryonic chick muscle cells30 and other cell membranes having nothing 
to do with sensory transduction.31 Patch recordings made from similar channels in the 
primary dendrites of the crayfish stretch receptor32 show that their relative permeabilities 
to sodium, potassium, and calcium are consistent with previous observations of the whole 
cell. How membrane deformation causes these channels to open is not known. 
Mechanosensory Hair Cells of the Vertebrate Ear
Our understanding of mechanotransduction has advanced furthest in studies of vertebrate 
hair cells. Mechanosensitive hair cells of the inner ear respond to acoustic vibration or head 
motion that causes fluid movements within the chambers of the inner ear. The exact form 
of the fluid movement depends on the shape and composition of the particular end organ 
involved. We discuss in Chapter 22 the structural and functional specializations that sup-
port auditory and vestibular signals. For now it will suffice to point out that hair cells in

the cochlea are stimulated by fluid movements within the acoustic frequency range—in 
humans, from 20 to 20,000 Hz. The vestibular end organs of the inner ear are constructed 
quite differently and respond to the much lower frequencies generated during head move-
ment. Mass loading of the saccule and utricle by an overlying otolithic membrane makes 
these epithelial sheets sensitive to linear acceleration. The hair cells in the semicircular 
canals are stimulated by angular acceleration during head rotation. Whatever the form of 
the fluid movement, in each case it causes deflection of a bundle of modified microvilli, 
or stereocilia, that project from the apical surface of the hair cell. Bundle deflection results 
directly in the opening of mechanosensitive ion channels.
Structure of Hair Cell Receptors
Hair cells and the surrounding supporting cells form epithelial sheets that separate dis-
similar fluid spaces of the inner ear. The basolateral membranes of hair cells are bathed by 
perilymph, similar in composition to ordinary extracellular fluid containing high sodium 
and low potassium (Figure 19.8). The apical, hair-bearing surface of the hair cell faces en-
dolymph, a solution similar in some ways to cytoplasm, having high potassium and low 
sodium and calcium concentrations. Hair cells make synaptic contact with afferent fibers 
on their basolateral surfaces. Many hair cells also receive synaptic input from efferent neu-
rons from the brainstem.

from the cuticular plate into the endolymphatic space. In some hair cells, a true cilium, the kino-
cilium, is found at one side of the hair bundle. Below the nucleus, hair cells form synapses with 
afferent and efferent neurons. Synaptic vesicles surround a dense body opposite the ending of an 
afferent neuron. Efferent neurons projecting from the brainstem form cholinergic synapses. Inside 
the hair cell, a synaptic cistern lies in close apposition to the plasma membrane underlying the 
efferent contact. (B) Transmission electron micrograph of a hair cell from chick inner ear. The hair

There are anywhere from a few dozen to hundreds of stereocilia (i.e., modified microvilli 
containing polymerized actin filaments), of graduated length, on different types of hair 
cells. The longest stereocilia are found on hair cells of the semicircular canals, the shortest 
in the high-frequency region of the cochlea. Within any one bundle, the stereocilia occur 
in an organ pipe or staircase array of ascending height. In many hair cells, a single true 
cilium, the kinocilium (containing a 9 + 2 microtubule array), is found near the middle of 
the tallest row of stereocilia. Cochlear hair cells have kinocilia early in development, but 
these disappear later. The stereocilia narrow to insert into a cuticular plate. During bundle 
deflection the stereocilia behave like rigid rods and bend at this insertion point.33 A variety 
of lateral linkages cause the assembly of stereocilia to move as a unified hair bundle.
Transduction by Hair Bundle Deflection
It has been known for a number of years that electrical responses in hair cells are pro-
duced by deformation of the hair bundle;34,35 however, direct experimental confirmation 
required the development of sensitive techniques for producing and measuring very small 
movements while recording from hair cells. Auditory and vestibular epithelia from cold-
blooded vertebrates, such as turtles and frogs, have proved particularly advantageous for 
these experiments. Procedures used for nanostimulation of hair cells in the turtle inner ear 
are shown in Figure 19.9A (see also Figure 19.12). A microelectrode records the hair cell’s 
membrane potential while a glass fiber attached to a piezoelectric manipulator pushes the 
hair bundle. Movements as small as 1 nm can be detected by projecting the image of the 
glass fiber, or the hair bundle itself, onto a pair of photodiodes. Such a stimulus produces 
a voltage change of 0.2 mV in the hair cell.36 
Hudspeth and colleagues elegantly revealed many of the details of transduction in 
vestibular hair cells of the frog.37–39 In one series of experiments they demonstrated directly 
the functional orientation of the hair bundle by varying the direction of stimulation with 
a piezoelectric manipulator. Deflections toward the kinocilium depolarized the cell, while 
movement away resulted in hyperpolarization. Bundle deflection perpendicular to that axis

caused no change in membrane current.40 The results of such an experiment are seen in 
Figure 19.9B, where the magnitude of the voltage change generated in the hair cell varies 
with the angle of bundle deflection.
Tip Links and Gating Springs
What structural feature of the hair bundle might underlie the directional selectivity of trans-
duction? Pickles and colleagues used the scanning electron microscope to describe a unique 
class of extracellular linkages connecting the top of one hair with the side of the adjacent taller 
hair.41 These tip links (Figure 19.10A) were observed only along the axis of mechanical stimu-
lation (i.e., oriented up and down the staircase). The position of the tip links suggested that 
they might be involved in mechanotransduction, and treatments that break the tip link abolish 
transduction.42,43 Indeed, extracellular recordings44,45 as well as calcium imaging46,47 indicated 
that the channels activated by mechanical stimuli are located at the very top of the stereocilia.
Quantitative measures of transduction and the identification of tip links are combined 
in the gating spring hypothesis of mechanotransduction in hair cells. Deflection of the hair 
bundle in the positive direction (i.e., toward the taller hairs) separates the tips to stretch 
a gating spring, thus pulling open the transduction channel (Figure 19.10B). When the 
bundle is pushed away from the tallest hairs, the spring is compressed and the channels 
close. Although such a scheme might seem somewhat fanciful, a direct physical connection 
between bundle mechanics and channel gating is required by the great speed at which 
transduction occurs in hair cells, with time constants of opening of about 40 μs.48,49 Further, 
the energetics and mechanics of transduction are consistent with this model. For example, 
it is possible to measure a decrease in bundle stiffness as the transduction channels open, 
as though this molecular motion relieves some tension on the gating spring.50 While the 
mechanism requires a spring-like element, the tip-link itself is composed of cadherin-23 
and protocadherin-15, making it too stiff to serve this function;51 thus, the molecular 
identity of the gating spring remains under investigation. 
Transduction Channels in Hair Cells
What types of channels are opened in the tips of hair cells? These appear to be nonselective

flection of the hair bundle in the excitatory direction extends the tip link and pulls open the 
transduction channel (right), while the opposite motion shortens the tip link (left), allowing 
the channel to close. Current models include a spring-like element within the transduction 
apparatus (but not the tip link itself), with mechanosensitive channels located at the tops

tance is large, greater than 100 pS.42,52,53 Strikingly, single-channel conductance increases 
as one progresses from low to high frequency hair cells. From conductance measurements 
and measurements of total transducer current, it is possible to calculate that each hair 
cell has only about 100 transduction channels. This corresponds to perhaps as few as two 
channels per stereocilium!
The very small number of channels in each hair cell makes biochemical and molecular 
biological investigation especially challenging. Hair cell transduction channels have no 
intrinsic voltage dependence, nor are they ligand gated in any traditional sense. It is unlikely, 
therefore, that strong homologies exist between these and most voltage- or ligand-gated 
ion channels. A large number of mechanosensitive ion channels have been cloned from 
bacteria, yeast, nematodes, and flies,21 providing candidate genes for future study.54 As yet, 
however, even one very strong candidate was not elected, since genetic knockout failed to 
eliminate hair cell transduction in mice.55
Adaptation of Hair Cells
Hair cells are extremely sensitive, with threshold responses to bundle motion of less than 
10–9 m.56 It seems likely, then, that some type of adaptive process exists to maintain sen-
sitivity in the face of a so-called background stimulus. For example, vestibular hair cells 
in the saccule and utricle must remain sensitive to subtle head movements while continu-
ously being subject to gravitational force acting on the overlying otolithic membrane (see 
Chapter 22). Indeed, it has been shown by direct measurement that hair cells adapt to a 
prolonged displacement by establishing a new set point for their operating range, with no 
loss of sensitivity. This form of set point adaptation is thought to arise from the action of 
a non-muscle myosin that exerts tension on the transduction channels by pulling against 
the actin core of the stereocilium.57 Myosins have been cloned from the inner ear,58 and 
specific antibodies have been used to show that myosin 1C is located near the tips of 
stereocilia in frog hair cells.59 This myosin-based adaptation depends on calcium influx 
and is relatively slow. It may be most prominent in vestibular hair cells. The more rapid 
adaptation seen in auditory hair cells may arise from calcium ions acting directly on the 
transduction channel, causing it to close.60
The tight coupling between mechanical input and transduction channel gating implies 
that feedback will occur during transduction.61 Thus, when the hair bundle is deflected, the 
calcium that enters through the open transduction channels can produce a further change 
in hair bundle stiffness or position. Similarly, alteration of hair cell membrane potential 
can move the hair bundle by changing the driving force for calcium entry. These feedback 
processes can give rise to mechanical resonance (or ringing) in bundle motion. Fettiplace 
and Crawford explored this phenomenon in auditory hair cells of the turtle using flexible 
glass fibers to deflect the hair bundle directly.36 A 75-nm step to the butt end of the glass 
fiber caused a smaller deflection of the tip attached to the bundle (Figure 19.11). The tip

motion was smaller because the bundle was relatively stiff compared to the wispy glass 
fiber. Further, although the imposed movement was square, the fiber tip showed a small 
oscillation that was coincident with an oscillatory receptor potential recorded from the 
hair cell. In other words, the glass fiber pushed the bundle, and the bundle pushed back! 
This oscillatory motion of the hair bundle results from transducer channel gating. The 
reciprocal interaction between bundle deflection and membrane potential contributes 
to the production of what are called ear sounds (i.e., otoacoustic emissions) that can be 
generated in most species, including humans.62 The ability to elicit otoacoustic emissions 
from the ear has provided a way for audiologists to assess hair cell function directly, even 
in infants or comatose patients.63
Olfaction
Mechanotransduction in the ear attains high sensitivity by tightly coupling the stimulus 
energy to the hair cell’s membrane potential. In contrast, great sensitivity is obtained in 
olfaction (smell) and vision, and in some forms of taste by chemical amplification—that 
is, second messenger pathways in which enzymatic cascades produce large numbers of 
intermediate products, thereby increasing by a thousand-fold the effect of one activated 
receptor molecule.
Olfaction is poorly developed in humans compared to dogs or pigs or butterflies. But 
at the same time, considerable effort (and advertising dollars) goes into human olfactory 
behavior (consider the numbers of soaps, deodorants, and perfumes that are aimed at 
securing a socially acceptable personal bouquet). In fact, olfactory signals are essential 
to human survival, stimulating feeding, reproduction, and mother–infant bonding.64,65
Detection and discrimination of the unique blend of odors linked to those behaviors begins 
with a large family of molecular receptors in the olfactory receptor neurons.
Olfactory Receptors
Mammals detect odors with a patch of about 100,000 olfactory receptor neurons whose 
axons project through a thin portion of the frontal skull (the cribriform plate) to the ol-
factory bulb (Figure 19.12). The long cilia of the olfactory receptors extend into the nasal 
cavity, where they lie in a layer of mucus, approximately 50 μm thick in humans, that is 
entirely replaced every 10 min. The mucous layer protects the sensory epithelium, wash-

ing out potentially toxic airborne compounds, and all odorants must dissolve through this 
to reach the sensory cilia. An odorant-binding protein helps to concentrate hydrophobic 
odorants in this aqueous layer.66 Olfactory receptors are continuously replaced throughout 
the animal’s lifetime. Each receptor lives for a month or two, and new receptors arise from 
a layer of basal cells in the olfactory epithelium.67
The Olfactory Response
Early measurements of olfactory responses were made by Adrian68 and Ottoson.69 Since 
then, evidence has accumulated that odorant molecules interact with receptors in the ciliary 
membrane to produce an increase in conductance, resulting in depolarization. Action po-
tentials then travel along the olfactory receptor axon into the CNS. Patch clamp techniques 
have been used to record both odorant-induced currents from isolated olfactory cells70 and 
to record the precise time course and localization of the odor response.
An example of such an experiment on a cell isolated from the olfactory mucosa of the 
salamander71 is shown in Figure 19.13. The membrane potential of the cell is held at –65 
mV, and a solution containing a mixture of odorant molecules (approximately 0.1 mM) 
in 100 mM KCl is applied from a second pipette by a brief (35 ms) pressure pulse—first 
to the soma, and then to the distal portion of the dendrite and the cilia. Pipette solution 
applied to the soma produces a rapid inward current, which is due to the local increase in 
potassium concentration. The time course of the potassium response provides a measure 
of the speed of application and subsequent dissipation of the solution by diffusion into the 
surrounding bath. A second, smaller and slower inward current appears when the odorants 
reach the apical dendrite. 
Solution applied to the apical dendrite and cilia produces only a small potassium response; 
presumably, there are fewer potassium channels in that portion of the cell. However, the 
odorant itself produces a large inward current that outlasts the time of application by several 
seconds. The experiment clearly indicates that the region of sensitivity to the odorants is 
the distal dendrite and cilia, and the prolonged time course of the dendritic response is 
consistent with the idea that the conductance change is produced by a second messenger 
system whose activity outlasts the initial odorant binding reaction.

Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channels in Olfactory Receptors
The depolarization produced by odorants arises from the opening of nonselective cation chan-
nels, permeable to Na+, K+, and Ca+.72,73 The channels, which are activated by intracellular 
cAMP (Figure 19.14), are closely related to the cation channels opened by cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) in rod photoreceptors.74 Indeed, several features of this transduction 
cascade are similar to that operating in photoreceptors, with the striking difference that an 
increase in light intensity leads to a decrease in cyclic nucleotide concentration and consequent 
hyperpolarization (see Chapter 20). Like rod photoreceptor channels, olfactory receptor chan-
nels are insensitive to changes in membrane potential. The influx of calcium, in turn, opens 
calcium-activated chloride channels, further contributing to the receptor potential.75–77 En-
hancement of the receptor potential by activation of chloride channels seems like an anomaly, 
as activation of chloride channels in most cells would be expected to produce hyperpolarization, 
or at least little change in membrane potential. However, the receptor regions of olfactory cells 
appear to have little resting chloride conductance and an intracellular chloride concentration 
similar to that of the mucus in which they are bathed. Thus, the chloride equilibrium potential, 
rather than being close to the resting membrane potential, is near 0 mV, and opening chloride 
channels results in outward chloride flux (i.e., inward, positive current).78 Only a few open 
channels are required to initiate action potentials because of the very high input resistance in 
olfactory receptors, suggesting that even single odorant molecules can be detected.79
Coupling the Receptor to Ion Channels
How is odorant binding coupled to the gating of cAMP-dependent cation channels? The 
mechanism of activation is outlined in Figure 19.14. Receptors coupled to G proteins first 
bind the odorant. The activated G protein releases the α-subunit, which stimulates adeny-
lyl cyclase to produce cAMP. An extensive family of candidate odorant receptor genes has 
been identified80 that encode seven-transmembrane, G protein–coupled proteins related 
in structure to metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors (see Chapter 12). The greatest 
variability between encoded proteins occurs in the sequence of three of the transmem-
brane domains that form the ligand-binding pocket. A G protein specifically expressed in 
olfactory epithelia (Golf) has also been identified,81 as has an olfactory adenylyl cyclase.82,83

found in sensory cilia that project into the mucous layer of the olfactory epithelium. Depolarizing 
receptor potentials in these long receptors give rise to action potentials that propagate along the 
olfactory receptor neuron’s axon into the central nervous system. (B) Odorant molecules bind to 
specific G protein–coupled receptors in the plasma membrane of the olfactory cilia. This frees 
the α-subunit to activate adenylyl cyclase (AC) and raise the concentration of cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP), which causes nonselective cation channels to open, depolarizing the 
membrane. Calcium-gated chloride current can enhance this effect. Other pathways may involve 
the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and the consequent rise in IP3 to act directly on plasma 
membrane calcium channels.

Activation of the receptors leads to a relatively rapid response. So, for example, Breer 
and colleagues84 used a stop-flow apparatus to show that a 10-fold increase in cAMP 
concentration occurred within 50 ms of odorant application in a preparation of isolated 
olfactory cilia. There is also evidence that olfactory neurons use G protein activation of 
phospholipase C and production of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) in transduction.85 In this 
case, IP3 may act directly to open calcium channels in the plasma membrane86 (see Figure 
19.14). IP3 appears to be especially important for invertebrate olfaction.87 The role of IP3
appears to be minimal for vertebrates, as transgenic mice lacking cAMP-gated channels had 
no residual ability to discriminate odors.88 However, IP3 signaling is required for the produc-
tion of nasal mucus; and so genetic knockout of IP3 receptors resulted in decreased mucus 
production, increased inflammation, and elevated olfactory thresholds in transgenic mice.89
Odorant Specificity
Mammals can discriminate a very large number of odors, and the existence of hundreds, or 
possibly thousands, of olfactory receptor proteins are the substrate for this capability. A re-
maining difficulty is the lack of odorant specificity of individual olfactory receptor neurons 
(ORNs), each of which recognize a spectrum of odors rather than being highly selective.90
One approach to further understanding this issue has been to determine the expression pat-
tern of cloned receptor molecules among olfactory receptor neurons using in situ hybridiza-
tion or expression of recombinant proteins. Each particular odorant receptor was found in a 
restricted area of the olfactory epithelium.91,92 Different families of receptor genes appear to 
be expressed in zones extending along the length of the epithelium (Figure 19.15A,B), with 
any given gene expressed in only a small number of olfactory receptor neurons. Each ORN 
expresses only one of the olfactory receptor genes, a remarkable result of feedback regula-
tion by the olfactory receptor protein.93,94 Each molecular receptor has rather broad binding 
affinities, accounting for the limited specificity of individual ORNs. In fact, there is no 1:1 
correspondence known between specific odorants and individual receptor proteins. 
Remarkably, those ORNs expressing the same molecular receptor project to a single pair 
of medial and lateral glomeruli in the first central relay station, the olfactory bulb95 (Figure

19.15C). This highly specific innervation pattern includes fasciculation of “like” axons prior to 
reaching the bulb, and also depends on expression of the molecular receptor protein.96 These 
features of olfactory organization are still more intriguing when one recalls that olfactory 
receptor neurons turn over every few weeks throughout the lifetime of the organism!90 The 
mechanisms producing this selective innervation pattern remain largely unknown.
In addition to the main olfactory epithelium, mammals possess a vomeronasal organ used 
for the detection of pheromones that stimulate mating and other social behaviors. Vomeronasal 
receptor neurons (VRNs) project to an accessory olfactory bulb, which in turn, projects to the 
limbic system. VRNs express additional families of molecular receptors. G protein–coupled 
vomeronasal receptors 1 and 2 (VR1 and VR2)97–99 each include over 100 genes in mice, some 
of which specifically bind known pheromones.100 G protein–coupled formyl peptide recep-
tors mediate immune cell responses to bacteria but also appear to be expressed specifically in 
VRNs,101 as are “trace-amine associated receptors.”102 Formyl peptides and trace amines are 
present in urine and so could contribute to assessment of gender, social status, or the state of 
health of individuals.103 Each vomeronasal neuron may express just one type of molecular 
receptor, and the pattern of expression differs between male and female rats.104
Mechanisms of Taste (Gustation)
Discussions of taste and smell are often combined because both senses are activated by 
chemical stimuli arriving from the outside world. Indeed, some tastants (i.e., taste stimuli) 
act on G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) in ways quite similar to those discussed for 
olfaction. However, other tastants, principally salts and acids, act directly on membrane 
conductances, and taste receptor cells differ anatomically from olfactory receptor neurons.
Taste Receptor Cells
Taste receptors are ciliated neuroepithelial cells and are found in taste buds on the tongue 
surface (Figure 19.16). Like olfactory receptors, taste cells are regenerated throughout life. 
Unlike olfactory receptors, taste cells do not have axons, but form chemical synapses with 
afferent neurites within the taste bud. Microvilli project from the apical pole of the taste cell 
into the open pore of the taste bud, where they come into contact with tastants dissolved in 
saliva on the tongue’s surface. Strikingly, only a subset of cells within the taste bud actually 
respond to tastants105 (Figure 19.16B). A second class of cells fails to respond to tastants. In-
stead, there is ultrastructural evidence that they receive chemical synaptic input from the taste 
cells. Communication between the two cell types may be mediated by ATP106 and serotonin.107

Taste Modalities 
Taste stimuli are usually subdivided into five categories: salt, sour, bitter, sweet, and umami, 
the last being a Japanese word for the taste of monosodium glutamate (MSG), or more 
generally, amino acid (i.e., meat) taste. Each category has its own transduction mechanism 
(Figure 19.17), which falls into one of two classes, both of which result in depolarization 
of the taste receptor membrane: (1) direct action of the tastant on ion channels, or (2) 
coupling of tastant receptors to ion channels through second messenger pathways involv-
ing G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs).108
There is good agreement that the taste of salt is mediated by direct flux of sodium (or 
other monovalent cations) through channels in the apical membrane of the taste cell that 
are open at rest.109 Sodium is present at higher concentration in salty foods (>100 mM) 
than in saliva, and it simply diffuses into the cells down its electrochemical gradient, thereby 
producing depolarization. The candidate channels are similar to epithelial sodium channels 
(ENaCs) found in frog skin and kidney. They are voltage insensitive and are blocked by 
the diuretic compound amiloride. The functional channels consist of three subunits.110
The α-subunit has been detected in lingual epithelium,111 and mice in which the ENaC 
α-subunit was genetically ablated lose their taste for sodium.112 
Sour taste is produced by the high concentration of protons in acidic foods. Protons 
may act by entering taste cells through the same amiloride-blockable sodium channels.113
Alternatively, protons may depolarize the cells by blocking normally open potassium chan-
nels.114 A third mechanism is seen in frog taste cells, which have cation channels that are 
activated by protons.115 In addition to acting at the taste cell’s cilia, salts and protons may 
percolate through the taste pore (a paracellular pathway) to act on the same or other ion 
channels (including some that are amiloride-insensitive) in the basolateral membranes of 
the cell.108 This illustrates what seems to be a general principle of gustation—that is, several 
parallel transduction pathways can exist for any one class of tastants.
Sweet, bitter, and umami tastes are mediated by GPCRs, probably acting through 
phospholipase C and IP3 to release calcium from internal stores,116 (see Chapter 12) and 
thereby activating calcium-dependent cation channels117 In addition, the intracellular 
messenger cAMP is altered through the activity of gustducin, a G protein specific to taste 
cells.118 Sensitivity to sweet, bitter, and umami is reduced in gustducin knockout mice.108 A 
growing number of molecular receptors for sweet, bitter, and umami have been identified 
in recent years. The family of GPCR molecules, T1R1, T1R2, and T1R3 may be expressed 
in sweet receptor cells. A large family of GPCRs, the T2Rs119,120 serve the taste of the widely 
varying class of bitter compounds. Finally, unusual forms of metabotropic glutamate 
receptors121 have been implicated in mediating umami taste. 
It is important to note that taste, as a percept, results from sensations in addition to 
those reported by the taste buds. The aromas detected by olfaction, as well as by texture and 
temperature, which are sensed by somatosensory neurons, all contribute to the ultimate 
identification and appreciation of food. The hot taste of chili peppers particularly reinforces 
this concept. Hot chilies are not sensed by taste cells per se, but rather by pain fibers in the

tongue that are activated by the compound capsaicin. A capsaicin receptor has been cloned 
and shown to be a calcium-selective cation channel.122 The hot receptor, known as transient 
receptor potential (subfamily V, member 1), or TRP-V1, is also found in small diameter 
sensory fibers (C fibers) responding to noxious temperatures (see following section). Thus, 
nature has provided chili peppers with a chemical targeted to this receptor, possibly to 
discourage herbivores by activating pain fibers—a not entirely successful strategy in the 
case of humans with a preference for spicy foods.
Pain and Temperature Sensation in Skin
The somatosensory system includes a rich variety of encapsulated and free nerve endings 
that provide input from the body, the surface skin, as well as deeper tissues. Specialized 
receptors for fine touch and vibration are discussed in Chapter 21. Here we will examine 
the neural basis of pain and temperature sensation. These percepts arise largely from 
the activity of small caliber C fibers and Aδ fibers. The stimuli affect free nerve endings, 
without any accessory structures, and act largely through indirect mechanisms of trans-
duction. One class of endings is activated selectively by noxious stimuli—mechanical 
injury, excessive heat or cold, or chemical damage. It is natural, then, to postulate a direct 
connection between activity in these fibers and the sensation of pain. The discovery of 
this separate population of nociceptors, together with the finding that low-threshold 
mechanoreceptors do not respond to painful stimuli, ruled out an earlier theory that 
pain results from the excessive mechanoreceptor stimulation. Indeed there is growing 
evidence for nociceptor submodalities; for example, a population of itch-specific affer-
ent neurons.123
Temperature changes are transduced by free nerve endings through the activation of TRP 
ion channels. Channel permeability varies with changes in skin temperature. Four different 
TRP channels, TRPV1 to TRPV4, are activated over different warm temperature ranges124
(Figure 19.18). As already noted, TRPV1 is activated by noxious heating and is sensitive 
to capsaicin. TRPM8 is a Ca2+-permeable channel activated by lowering temperature.125
Menthol and eucalyptol also activate this channel, which explains the cooling sensation 
evoked by these compounds. Painful (or noxious, <17°C) cold requires the additional 
participation of TRPA1 channels.126

Activation and Sensitization of Nociceptors
Nociception (the perception of noxious or damaging stimuli) arises from a combination 
of direct and indirect actions on peripheral sensors. Painful heat (hotter than about 43° 
C) causes nonspecific cation channels (TRPV1) to open in C fiber endings.127,128 Calcium 
and sodium ions enter and depolarize the cell, causing action potential generation. Pro-
longed exposure of these endings to capsaicin eventually causes calcium accumulation 
and cell death. For this reason capsaicin is used as a long-term analgesic, presumably 
relieving chronic pain by killing C fiber afferents.129 Acids also may act to open cation 
channels directly, and an acid-sensitive ion channel (ASIC) has been cloned from noci-
ceptive neurons.130 Mechanical stimuli leading to skin damage can also produce direct 
activation of nociceptive endings. 
In addition to being activated directly by painful stimuli, nociceptors respond to 
chemical activators, such as ATP, released from damaged cells. One ATP receptor subunit 
(P2X3) occurs specifically in C fiber somata in dorsal root ganglia and may contribute to 
the structure of nociceptive ATP receptors in the sensory terminals.131–133 Cellular dam-
age also leads to the release of cytoplasmic proteases, which then cleave serum proteins. 
In this manner the nine–amino acid peptide, bradykinin, is produced from kininogen, a 
ubiquitous inactive precursor. Bradykinin is a potent activator of C fiber endings. Unlike 
ATP, its effects are mediated by metabotropic receptors, rather than by direct action on 
membrane channels.134 Bradykinin and other chemicals in damaged skin also act to increase 
the excitability of (i.e., sensitize) nociceptive endings activated by other stimuli. For example, 
responses to noxious heat stimuli are larger and occur at a lower temperature than normal 
in the presence of bradykinin.128 Other inflammatory mediators include prostaglandins, 
serotonin, histamine, and substance P. Prostaglandin E2 and serotonin increase sensitivity 
by lowering the threshold for activation of voltage-gated sodium currents.135 Activated 
pain fibers release substance P not only from their synapses within the spinal cord (see 
Chapter 14), but also from their terminals in the skin. In the periphery, substance P may 
increase the excitability of C fibers by blocking K+ channels.136 The process of sensitization 
is accompanied by local vasodilatation and edema. The affected area becomes hyperalgesic, 
having a reduced threshold for pain.
SUMMARY
 
■
Each type of sensory receptor responds preferentially to 
one type of stimulus energy, the adequate stimulus.
 
■
Short and long receptors differ morphologically and 
functionally. Short receptors encode stimulus intensity 
directly in the amplitude of the receptor potential. Long 
receptors take the additional step of converting the 
receptor potential amplitude into a frequency code of 
action potential firing.
 
■
The response of many receptors varies with the log of 
the stimulus intensity. This enables some receptor types 
to have a wide dynamic range.
 
■
Most sensory receptors adapt during maintained 
stimuli. Adaptation arises from both mechanical 
and electrical factors. In some receptors, very rapid 
adaptation makes them tuned to rapidly varying stimuli, 
such as vibration.
 
■
Mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear couple 
movement directly to the gating of ion channels by 
physical connection. The tip link that connects adjacent 
stereocilia is stretched by deflection of the hair bundle 
and so pulls open an ion channel.
 
■
Calcium entry through the nonselective 
mechanotransduction channel of hair cells leads to 
adaptation and closure of the channel. 
 
■
Olfactory neurons employ G protein–coupled 
membrane receptors that lead to the opening of cAMP-
gated cation channels in the plasma membrane.
 
■
Each member of the large family of olfactory receptor 
proteins is expressed in a small number of olfactory 
receptors. All neurons expressing a particular receptor 
protein project to a single glomerulus in the olfactory 
bulb.
 
■
Amino acids, sugars, and bitter compounds bind to 
G protein–coupled receptors in taste sensory cells.
 
■
Salt and protons (sour) act directly on ion channels to 
generate receptor potentials in taste cells.
 
■
Pain and temperature sensations are mediated by a 
variety of chemical messengers. Direct mechanical 
damage or excessive heat initiate action potentials in 
pain fibers. Compounds released from damaged tissue, 
such as bradykinin, sensitize nociceptive endings.

Transduction and Transmission 
in the Retina
T
he way in which neuronal signals are evoked by light to produce our perception of scenes 
with objects and background, movement, shade, and color begins in the retina. Responses 
to light start at receptors known as rods and cones that contain visual pigments. Rods are 
highly sensitive and can be activated by a single quantum of light. Color and daylight vision de-
pend on cones. Absorption of light by the visual pigment of a photoreceptor activates a G protein, 
leading to a cascade of biochemical reactions. As a result, nucleotide-gated cation channels in the 
membrane close, causing the photoreceptor to become hyperpolarized. Light thereby reduces on-
going transmitter release onto postsynaptic bipolar and horizontal cells. Signals from photorecep-
tors finally reach ganglion cells, whose axons enter the optic nerve and constitute the sole output 
from the eye.
The connections between photoreceptors and ganglion cells involve bipolar, horizontal, and 
amacrine cells. Like rods and cones, bipolar and horizontal cells produce graded local potentials, 
not action potentials. Signaling by individual neurons in the retina and at successive levels of the 
visual system is best analyzed in terms of receptive fields, which are the building blocks for per-
ception. Receptive field of a neuron in the visual system refers to the restricted area of the retinal 
surface that, upon illumination, enhances or inhibits the signaling of that cell. The receptive field 
of a retinal ganglion cell is a small circular area on the retina. Action potentials are evoked either in 
“on” ganglion cells by small spots of light shone onto the center of the receptive field, or in “off” 
cells by reducing the light (like a shadow) in the center of the receptive field. Two groups of gan-
glion cells are functionally important. Known as parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M), they are 
distinguished by their sizes, positions, connections, and physiological responses. Smaller 
P ganglion cells exhibit fine spatial discrimination and some have color sensitivity. Larger M gangli-
on cells respond better to moving stimuli and to small changes in contrast. These distinctive prop-
erties of M and P divisions are maintained through successive stages in the brain. A small number 
of specialized ganglion cells respond directly to illumination and provide information about the 
level of background illumination.
The performance of nerve cells in the retina is described more fully here than in Chapters 1 
and 2, which served to illustrate principles of signaling and organization. We begin with a brief 
review of the visual pathways to put in perspective the details of retinal organization that follow. 
Because photoreceptors produce unusual signals that give rise to functional transmission through 
the retina, their responses to light are dealt with in this chapter rather than in Chapter 19.

408 Chapter 20
The Eye
The retina in the eye acts as a self-contained outpost of the brain. It collects information, 
analyzes it, and hands it on to higher centers through the well-defined optic nerve path-
way for further processing. The initial step in visual processing is the formation on each 
retina of a sharp, inverted image of the outside world. Essential for clear vision are: (1) 
correct focus of the image by adjustment of the thickness of the lens (accommodation); 
(2) regulation of light entering the eye by the pupil diameter; (3) convergence of the two 
eyes to ensure that matching images fall on corresponding points of both retinas; and (4) 
eye movements that compensate for self-generated or forced movements of the head. Our 
vision is not uniformly detailed across the visual field but is most acute in the center. We 
can read small print at the center of gaze, but not in the peripheral field of vision. This 
loss of acuity arises from decreased receptor density and changes in connectivity in the 
peripheral retina more than from optical effects. We describe first the principal anatomi-
cal features of the visual pathway and then the stepwise transformation of signals through 
the retina as light is trapped by visual pigments to generate changes in electrical currents.
Anatomical Pathways in the Visual System
The pathways from the eye to the cerebral cortex are illustrated in Figure 20.1, which depicts 
some of the major landmarks of the visual system in a rat brain. The retinal ganglion cell 
axons enter the optic nerve, about half cross at the optic chiasm, and end in a part of the 
thalamus called the lateral geniculate nucleus. Because of optical reversal by the lens, which 
projects the left visual field onto the right side of each retina, each cerebral hemisphere sees 
the visual field on the opposite side. 
Layering of Cells in the Retina
Among the reasons the retina is inviting for physiological research is the neat layering and 
stereotyped morphology of the relatively few nerve cell types—there are only five main

FIGURE 20.1 Central Targets of Retinal Ganglion Cells. The 
great majority of retinal ganglion cells respond to light transduced 
by photoreceptors and transmitted via bipolar cells, and send their 
axons to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. From there in-
formation flows to visual cortex (see Chapter 2). These classic retinal 
ganglion cells (thick violet lines) carry information about color, shape, 
movement, all the details that give us form vision and the ability to 
analyze the visual world. A small minority of retinal ganglion cells are 
intrinsically photosensitive due to the expression of the photopig-
ment melanopsin. These intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion 
cells (ipRGCs; thin green lines) project to the suprachiasmatic nucleus 
(SCN) (see Chapter 17) through the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to 
form the retinohypothalamic tract (orange lines) that drives circadian 
rhythms. This circuit involves the intermediolateral nucleus (IML) of the 
spinal cord, and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) that ultimately 
stimulates melatonin release from the pineal gland (P). Other ipRGCs 
project to the olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN) and from there to the 
Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW) to activate motoneurons in the cili-
ary ganglion (CG) that control muscles of the iris (blue lines). (After 
Berson, 2003).

classes.1–4 The arrangement and typical positions of various cells are illus-
trated in Figure 20.2. On the deep surface, farthest from the lens and pupil, 
lie the photoreceptors, comprised of the rods, which are concerned with 
dim light vision, and cones, which are used with daylight illumination when we can perceive 
color. Cones are connected to the bipolar cells that in turn connect to the ganglion cells, 
whose axons are the optic nerve fibers. The connectivity of rods is more complex, connect-
ing to an intervening interneuron (amacrine cell) that piggybacks onto the cone circuitry.
Apart from this through-line, there are other cells that make predominantly lateral 
(i.e., side-to-side) connections. These are the horizontal cells and the amacrine cells. Only 
ganglion cells and some amacrine cells generate action potentials. Photoreceptors, horizontal 
cells, and bipolar cells give only locally graded signals. Within each of these major classes, 
there are subgroups exhibiting important differences in structure and function. Müller 
cells and astrocytes, the properties of which are described in Chapter 10, constitute the 
glial cells of the retina.
Phototransduction in Retinal Rods and Cones
Photoreceptors set the stage for vision and define how the outside world can be perceived; 
their spectral range varies between species. For example, many invertebrates can detect 
ultraviolet light, and some can use the polarized properties of skylight to navigate (see 
Chapter 18). Human photoreceptors normally detect neither of these signals, but they 
can out-perform some fellow mammals. Cats, lacking appropriate receptors, are color 
blind (though we are too at night, when all cats are gray). On the other hand, the sensitiv-
ity of mammalian rods in darkness is such that a single quantum of light can give rise to 
a measurable signal, and only seven or so rods need to be activated by single quanta for 
a conscious sensation.5 Yet with less-sensitive cone photoreceptors, we can detect subtle 
tints and differences in contrast or color on a bright day, when the light intensity is 100 
million times greater. 
In terms of transduction mechanisms, it will be apparent that there are striking simi-
larities between the generation of responses to light by photoreceptors compared to the 
responses to odors by olfactory receptors described in Chapter 19.

Arrangement and Morphology of Photoreceptors
The rods and cones constitute a densely packed array of photodetectors in the layer of 
retina adjacent to the pigment epithelium (Figure 20.3; see Figure 20.2) that is farthest 
from the cornea and incoming light. The pigment epithelium absorbs the light that is 
not absorbed by the photoreceptors, thereby reducing scattering of light within the eye. 
Thus, with the exception of one small retinal area, the fovea, light must traverse layers 
of cells and fibers before reaching the light absorbing outer segments of receptors. As 
Helmholtz wrote in 1867,
There is in the retina a remarkable spot which is placed near its center…and which…
is called the fovea or pit…[It] is of great importance for vision since it is the spot 
where the most exact discrimination is made. The cones are here packed most closely 
together and receive light which has not been impeded by other semi-transparent 
parts of the retina. We may assume that a single nervous…connection…runs from 
each of these cones through the trunk of the optic nerve to the brain…and there 
produces its special impression so that the excitation of each individual cone will 
produce a distinct and separate effect upon the sense.6
It is extraordinary that Helmholtz could write this paragraph before the word “synapse” 
or even the cell doctrine existed.
Counts made at the fovea reveal that cones are closely packed, with a density of 200,000/
mm2, and that rods are excluded. Moreover, the cones at the fovea are more slender than 
those in peripheral parts of the retina.2 Since the fovea contains no rods, it constitutes a 
blind spot in very dim light, such as at night. A different blind spot corresponds to the 
region of the retina through which the optic nerve fibers leave the eye; at this spot, the 
optic disc, there are no photoreceptors at all.
Figure 20.4 shows three principal features of photoreceptor structure: (1) an outer 
segment within which light is absorbed by visual pigments; (2) an inner segment contain-
ing the nucleus, ion pumps, transporters, ribosomes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic 
reticulum; and (3) the synaptic terminal, which releases glutamate onto second-order cells 
and which also receives synaptic inputs. The release site of the synaptic ending is highly 
characteristic with one or more ribbon structures, along which are aligned the vesicles 
containing transmitter7 (see Figure 20.17).

Electrical Responses of Vertebrate Photoreceptors to Light
As described earlier, sensory receptors typically respond to appropriate stimuli by graded 
local depolarization that initiates action potentials. Although the majority of invertebrate 
photoreceptors behave in this way (Figure 20.5A),8 the responses of most vertebrate pho-
toreceptors to light are very different. Figure 20.5B shows the responses of a turtle rod 
recorded with an intracellular microelectrode.9 In the dark (at rest), the photoreceptor is 
depolarized by a continuous inward current flowing into the outer segment. Light turns 
off the ongoing inward current, leaving the always-present outward potassium current to 
hyperpolarize the cell. The following paragraphs deal with the way in which light is absorbed 
by photoreceptors and the mechanisms that underlie the production of electrical signals.

412 Chapter 20
Visual Pigments
Visual pigments are concentrated in membranes of the outer segments. Each rod contains 
approximately 108 pigment molecules. They are aggregated on several hundred discrete disks 
(approximately 750 in a monkey rod) that do not make contact with the outer membrane 
(see Figure 20.4C). By contrast, cones have pigment-laden infoldings that are continuous 
with the cell membrane. Pigment molecules make up about 80% of the total disk protein. 
The visual pigment is so closely packed on outer segment membranes that the distance 
between two visual pigment molecules in a rod is less than 10 nm.10 This dense packing 
of sensitive molecules in serial layers of membranes traversed by light enhances the prob-
ability that a photon will be trapped on its way through the outer segment. The following 
question then arises: How are signals generated when light is absorbed by visual pigments?
Absorption of Light by Visual Pigments
Light is absorbed by the visual pigment rhodopsin in rods and a related pigment in cones. 
The events that occur when this happens have been studied by psychophysical, biochemical, 
physiological, and molecular techniques. Visual pigment molecules consist of two moieties: 
(1) a protein, known as opsin and (2) a chromophore (i.e., a chemical group producing color 
in a compound), 11-cis vitamin A aldehyde, known as retinal. The absorption characteris-
tics of the visual pigments have been measured quantitatively by spectrophotometry.11,12
When different wavelengths of light are shone through a solution of the rod visual pigment 
rhodopsin, blue–green light, at a wavelength of about 500 nanometers (nm), is absorbed 
most effectively. The absorption spectrum is similar when small spots of light of different 
wavelengths are shone onto single rods under the microscope. An elegant correspondence 
has been demonstrated between the absorption characteristics of rhodopsin and our per-
ception in dim light. Quantitative psychophysical measurements made in human subjects 
show that blue-greenish lights at about 500 nm are optimal for perception of a dim light in 
the dark. In daylight, when rods are inactive and cones are used, we are more sensitive to red 
light, corresponding to the absorption spectra of cones (which will be discussed shortly).10
Once a photon has been absorbed by rhodopsin, retinal undergoes photoisomeriza-
tion and changes from the 11-cis to an all-trans configuration. This transition is extremely 
rapid; it takes place in approximately 10–12 seconds. The protein then undergoes a series 
of transformational changes through various intermediates.13 One conformation of the 
protein, metarhodopsin II, is of crucial importance for transduction (discussed later in 
the chapter). Figure 20.6 shows the sequence of changes occurring in bleaching and in 
regeneration of active rhodopsin. Metarhodopsin II appears after about 1 millisecond (ms). 
Regeneration of pigments after bleaching is slow, taking many minutes; it entails transfer 
of retinal between the photoreceptors and the pigment epithelium.14

isomerization of the 11-cis retinal to all-trans 
retinal. The opsin–all-trans molecule, in turn, is 
rapidly converted to metarhodopsin II, which 
is dissociated to opsin and all-trans retinal. 
The regeneration of rhodopsin depends on 
interactions between photoreceptors and cells 
of the retinal pigment epithelium. Metarhodop-
sin II is the trigger that sets in motion activa-
tion of the second messenger system. (After

Structure of Rhodopsin
The protein opsin consists of 348 amino acid residues with seven hy-
drophobic regions of 20 to 25 amino acids, comprising seven trans-
membrane helices.15 The amino terminus is located in the extracel-
lular space (i.e., within the disk in rods) and the carboxy terminus in 
the cytoplasm (Figure 20.7). Retinal is attached to opsin through a 
lysine residue in the seventh membrane-spanning segment. Opsin is a 
member of the family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins that 
includes metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors, such as adrenergic 
and muscarinic receptors. Like rhodopsin, those receptors exert their 
effects through second messengers by activating G proteins (see Chap-
ter 12). The stability of rhodopsin in the dark is extraordinarily high. 
Baylor calculated that spontaneous thermal isomerization of a single 
rhodopsin molecule should occur once every 3000 years or 1023 times 
more slowly than photoisomerization.16
Cones and Color Vision
Extraordinary insights and experiments by Young and Helmholtz in the 
nineteenth century defined crucial questions for color vision and at the 
same time provided clear, unequivocal explanations. Their conclusion 
that there must be three types of sensory photoreceptors for color has 
stood the test of time and has been confirmed at the molecular level. 
To set the stage, we quote again from Helmholtz, who compares the perception of light 
and sound as well as color and tone. One envies the clarity, force, and timeless beauty of his 
thinking, especially in view of the confusing, vitalistic concepts that were current at the time:
All differences of hue depend upon combinations in different proportions of the 
three primary colors…red, green and violet…Just as the difference of sensation of 
light and warmth depends…upon whether the rays of the sun fall upon nerves of 
sight or nerves of feeling, so it is supposed in Young’s hypothesis that the differ-
ence of sensation of colors depends simply upon whether one or the other kind of 
nervous fibers are more strongly affected. When all three kinds are equally excited, 
the result is the sensation of white light…If we allow two different colored lights to 
fall at the same time upon a white screen…we see only a single compound, more or 
less different from the two original ones. We shall better understand the remarkable 
fact that we are able to refer all the varieties in the composition of external light to 
mixtures of three colors if we compare the eye with the ear…In the case of sound…
we recognize the long waves as low notes, the short as high-pitched, and the ear may 
receive at once many waves of sound, that is to say many notes. But here these do 
not melt into compound notes in the same way that colors…melt into compound 
colors. The eye cannot tell the difference if we substitute orange for red and yellow; 
but if we hear the notes C and E sounded at the same time, we cannot put D instead 
of them…if the ear perceived musical tones as the eye colors, every accord might be 
completely represented by combining only three constant notes, one very low, one 
very high and one intermediate, simply changing the relative strength of these three 
primary notes to produce all possible musical effects…But we find a continuous 
transition of colors into one another through numberless intermediate gradations…
the way in which (colors) appear…depends chiefly upon the constitution of our 
nervous system…It must be confessed that both in man and in quadrupeds we have 
at present no anatomical basis for this theory of colors.6
These farsighted, accurate predictions were validated by quite different sets of observations. 
Using spectrophotometry, Wald, Brown, MacNichol, Dartnall, and their colleagues11,12,17
showed the existence of three types of cones with different pigments in human retina (Figure 
20.8A). Second, Baylor and his colleagues recorded currents from monkey and human 
cones. The results are shown in Figure 20.8B.18 Three populations of cones were found 
with distinct but overlapping sensitivities in the blue, green, or red part of the spectrum. 
The wavelengths of light optimal for initiating electrical signals coincided precisely with the

as well as by psychophysical measurements of spectral sensitivity (Figure 20.8C). Moreover, 
the genes for the blue, green, or red cone opsin pigments as well as the gene for rhodopsin 
were cloned and sequenced by Nathans.19–21
What accounts for the ability of different visual pigment molecules to trap specific wave-
lengths of light preferentially? It turns out that rhodopsin, the rod visual pigment, and all three 
cone visual pigments contain the same chromophore: 11-cis retinal. However, the amino acid 
sequences of the various pigment proteins differ from one another (Figure 20.9). Differences

Transduction and Transmission in the Retina 415
in just a few amino acids account for the differences in spectral sensitivity. Insights into the 
evolution of color vision have been gained from comparisons of opsin genes in vertebrates, 
and among old and new world primates in particular,22 while studies of inherited defects in 
humans23,24 provide additional understanding of the molecular basis of color vision.
Color Blindness
Although a single type of photoreceptor cannot on its own provide information about 
color, three types of cones with properties shown in Figure 20.8 can. In principle, two 
types of cones with different pigments might be sufficient to distinguish colors of light, 
but many different mixtures of wavelengths would then appear identical. This is the situ-
ation in certain color-blind people, in whom Nathans has shown that a genetic defect 
results in an absence of one of the pigments. From our present perspective, one can only 
marvel that explanations at the molecular level so beautifully confirm the brilliant but 
rigorous speculations of Young and Helmholtz. Their idea that major attributes of color 
vision and color blindness are to be found within the receptors themselves has now been 
confirmed by direct physiological measurements and corresponding differences in genes 
and protein structure.21
Transduction 
How does photoisomerization of rhodopsin give rise to a change in mem-
brane potential? For many years, it was clear that some sort of internal 
transmitter was required for the generation of electrical signals in rods 
and cones. One reason is that information about the capture of photons 
in a rod outer segment must somehow be conveyed from rhodopsin, lo-
cated in the disk, across the cytoplasm to the outer membrane. A second 
reason is the enormous amplification of the response. Baylor and his 
colleagues,25 working on turtle photoreceptors, showed that decreases 
in membrane conductance and measurable electrical signals were pro-
duced when a single photon was absorbed and activated one pigment 
molecule out of about 108.
The sequence of events through which activated photopigment 
molecules change membrane potential has since been elucidated by patch 
clamp recordings from rod and cone outer segments and by molecular 
techniques.26 The scheme for transduction from light to electrical signals 
is shown in Figure 20.10.
In darkness, a continuous dark current flows into the outer segment 
of rods and cones.27 As a result, they have membrane potentials of ap-
proximately –40 mV, which is positive to the potassium equilibrium 
potential, EK (–80 mV). The inward current in the dark is carried mainly 
by sodium, moving down its electrochemical gradient through cation 
channels in the outer segment. Hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor by 
light is brought about by closure of the channels, allowing the membrane 
potential to move toward EK.
Properties of the Photoreceptor Channels
The cation channels in the outer segment, under normal physiologi-
cal conditions, have calcium/sodium/potassium permeability ratios of 
12.5:1.0:0.7, and a very low single-channel conductance of around 25 
femtosiemens (fS).28 However, that value depends in part on the acti-
vation level29 and in part on the blocking effect of divalent cations.30
Because the sodium concentration is much higher than that of calcium, 
about 85% of the inward current is carried by sodium. The driving 
force for potassium movement is, of course, outward. As calcium ions 
move through the channels, they are tightly bound to sites within the 
pore and thus interfere with the passage of other cations. Because of

FIGURE 20.10 Dark Current in a Rod. (A) In darkness, 
sodium ions flow through cation channels of the rod outer 
segment, causing a depolarization; calcium ions also enter 
through the cation channels. The current loop is completed 
through the neck of the rod, with the outward movement 
of potassium through the inner segment membrane. (B) 
When the outer segment is illuminated, the channels close 
because of a decrease in intracellular cyclic guanosine mo-
nophosphate (cGMP), and the rod then becomes hyperpo-
larized. This hyperpolarization reduces transmitter release. 
Sodium, potassium, and calcium concentrations of the rod 
are maintained by pumps and exchangers in the inner seg-
ment (red circles); calcium exchangers are also present in 
the outer segment (see Box 20.1). (After Baylor, 1987.)

this property, removal of calcium from the solution around the cell allows sodium and 
potassium to move much more freely through the channel, increasing its conductance 
to about 25 picosiemens (pS).
Fesenko, Yau, Baylor, Stryer, and their colleagues28,31,32 have shown that cyclic guanosine 
monophosphate (cGMP) acts as the internal transmitter from disk to surface membrane 
and fulfills the requirements of appropriate kinetics and great amplification. As shown in 
Figure 20.11, a high cytoplasmic concentration of cGMP keeps the cation channels in an 
open state. When the cGMP concentration of the fluid facing the inside of the membrane 
is reduced, channel openings become rare events. Thus, the membrane potential of the 
photoreceptors is a reflection of the cytoplasmic cGMP concentration—the higher the 
concentration, the more the cell is depolarized. The cGMP concentration in turn is in-
versely related to the intensity of ambient light. Increasing light intensity reduces cGMP 
concentration and reduces the fraction of open channels. In the absence of cGMP, almost 
all the channels are closed and the resistance of the outer segment membrane approaches 
that of a channel-free lipid bilayer.
Molecular Structure of Cyclic GMP–Gated Channels
Complementary DNAs for rod outer segment channels have been isolated and the amino 
acid sequences determined for channel subunits from human, bovine, mouse, and chicken 
retinas. There is a pronounced sequence similarity between cDNAs of outer segment channel 
subunits and the subunits of other cyclic-nucleotide–gated channels—for example, those 
found in the olfactory system.33 Their membrane regions share structural similarities with 
other cation-selective channels, particularly in the S4 region and the region of the pore (see 
Chapter 5). The photoreceptor channels are tetramers made up of at least two different 
subunit proteins, α and β, with apparent molecular sizes of 63 and 240 kilodaltons (kD), 
respectively. The intracellular nucleotide-binding site is near the carboxy terminus of the 
α and β-subunits.34
The cGMP Cascade
The sequence of events leading to reduction in cGMP concentration and consequent 
closing of the cation channels is shown in Figure 20.12. The decrease in internal cGMP 
concentration triggered by light is brought about by metarhodopsin II, an intermediary 
in the bleaching process in which the chromophore separates from the protein (see Figure 
20.6). Metarhodopsin II acts on the G protein, transducin, which consists of α, β, and γ
polypeptide chains.35,36

The transient interaction of metarhodopsin II and transducin causes guanosine 
diphosphate (GDP) bound to the α-subunit to be exchanged for guanosine triphosphate 
(GTP). This activates the α-subunit, which separates from the β and γ-subunits, and in turn 
activates a membrane-bound phosphodiesterase, which is the enzyme that hydrolyzes cGMP. 
The cGMP concentration falls, fewer sodium channels open, and the rods hyperpolarize. 
The cascade is terminated by phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal region of the active 
metarhodopsin II (Box 20.1). The key role of cGMP in controlling the channels during 
the response is supported by biochemical experiments. Illumination of photoreceptors can 
cause a 20% decrease in the internal cGMP concentration.16
Amplification through the cGMP Cascade
Two steps of the cGMP cascade provide the great amplification that accounts for the exquisite 
sensitivity of rods to light. First, a single molecule of active metarhodopsin II catalyzes the 
exchange of many molecules of transducin GDP for GTP and thereby liberates hundreds 
of G protein α-subunits.36 Second, each α-subunit activates a molecule of phosphodies-
terase in the disk that can hydrolyze a large number of cytoplasmic cGMP molecules and 
thereby allow many channels to close.
Responses to Single Quanta of Light
The finding that single quanta of light can give rise to a conscious sensation raises a num-
ber of tantalizing questions. How large is the unitary response; how is it distinguished 
from ongoing noise; and how is such minimal information transferred faithfully through 
the retina to higher centers? To measure unitary responses to single quanta, Baylor and 
his colleagues recorded photo-activated currents of individual rods in retinas from toad, 
monkey, and human.37 These experiments provide a rare example of the way in which a 
process as complex as seeing the dimmest possible flashes of light can be correlated with 
the events that occur in single molecules.38
The procedure was to isolate a piece of retina from the animal or from a cadaver and 
maintain it in darkness. To measure currents, the outer segment of the rod was sucked

Adaptation of Photoreceptors
The light intensities that humans use for vision range from the 
detection of single photons to bright sunlight on a tropical 
beach, a dynamic range of more than 1013. Since pupillary 
constriction reduces light by only 10-fold, adaptation by pho-
toreceptors accounts for most of the wide range of sensitiv-
ity39 and is achieved largely by retinal cones, which are used 
in daylight and starlight. Although our rods saturate at light 
levels that we associate with daytime vision, even indoors, 
our cones can adjust to very bright lights, saturating just be-
fore light intensities become damaging.
Thus, it is essential to ensure that responses to light can 
occur at different background levels of illumination. If bright, 
ambient light were able to close all the nucleotide-gated 
channels, the receptor would be unable to register any further 
increase in intensity. 
Calcium is one factor of key importance for adapta-
tion of photoreceptors.40,41 In the dark, the nucleotide-gated 
channels are open and calcium ions continually flow into 
the photoreceptor. Calcium is extruded by ion pumps and 
exchangers in the outer segment (see Figure 20.10).42 Under 
conditions of steady illumination, the channels close and 
calcium entry is reduced. Because calcium is still actively 
extruded (see Figure 20.10), the intracellular calcium concen-
tration falls. The reduced intracellular calcium concentration 
opposes closure of the nucleotide-gated channels by several 
mechanisms.
First, calcium reduces the affinity of channels to cGMP 
through the calcium-binding protein, calmodulin. Lowered 
calcium concentration therefore increases the affinity of the 
channels to cGMP and, thereby, potentiates channel open-
ing and current flow during illumination. Second, lowered in-
tracellular calcium favors intracellular cGMP accumulation by 
increasing the activity of guanylate cyclase (i.e., promotes 
cGMP synthesis) and inhibiting the activation of phospho-
diesterase (i.e., slows cGMP hydrolysis). Third, lowered 
intracellular calcium causes phosphorylation of metarho-
dopsin II and thereby speeds up its inactivation. The rate 
of termination of the catalytic activity of metarhodopsin II is 
of importance for transduction, since, while it is active, the 
cascade continues to generate a signal. The phosphoryla-
tion of activated rhodopsin is mediated by recoverin,43 a cal-
cium-binding molecule that is also involved in the inhibition 
of phosphodiesterase. Dark adaptation, which is the reverse 
of light adaptation, is principally limited by the regeneration 
of photopigment, which for full adaptation can take up to 10 
minutes for cones and 30 minutes for rods.
Molecular mechanisms for adaptation were analyzed by 
Baylor and his colleagues41, who measured the rate of adap-
tation of photoreceptor responses in normal and transgenic 
mice in which 15 amino acids were deleted from the C termi-
nus of rhodopsin, the presumptive site for phosphorylation of 
activated rhodopsin.44,45 In a normal rod (part B of the figure), 
a flash of light produces an outward current that adapts 
(i.e., decreases) as expected. Part C of the figure shows the 
response of a rod in a transgenic mouse to a flash—the re-
sponse, instead of declining, lasts about 20 times longer than 
normal. Thus, the 15 amino acids that had been deleted con-
stitute the region of the molecule required for recovery from 
the effects of a flash of light.

amino acids from the C terminus. The duration of the response 
was prolonged through failure of the altered rhodopsin molecule to 
become shut off after the flash. PDE = phosphodiesterase (After

Transduction and Transmission in the Retina 419
into a fine pipette (Figure 20.13). As expected, in 
darkness a current flowed continuously into the 
outer segment. Flashes of light closed channels in 
the outer segment, causing a decrease in the dark 
current. Figure 20.14A shows responses to very dim 
light flashes, corresponding to one or two quanta 
of light on the outer segment. The currents are 
small and quantal in nature. That is, sometimes a 
dim flash evokes a unitary response, sometimes a 
doublet, and sometimes nothing at all.
In monkey rods, the current reduction caused 
by transduction of a single photon is about 0.5 
picoamperes (pA). This corresponds to the closure 
of approximately 300 channels, or of about 3% 
to 5% of the rod channels that are open in the 
dark, and is the result of the large amplification 
through the cGMP cascade. Moreover, because of 
the extreme stability of visual pigments mentioned 
earlier, random isomerizations and spurious chan-
nel closings are rare events. This allows the effects

of single-light quanta to stand out against an extremely quiet background. It has been 
shown that electrical coupling through gap junctions between photoreceptors provides an 
additional smoothing effect that reduces the background noise and improves the signal-
to-noise ratio for responses of rods to single quanta.46 
Circadian Photoreceptors in the Mammalian Retina
Form and color vision in mammals are served by rods and cones, each with their specific 
photopigment. In contrast, other light-dependent behaviors, such as pupillary reflexes 
and entrainment of circadian rhythms depend on entirely different sensory receptors and 
visual pigments. Blind mice that fail to produce either rods or cones still exhibit circadian 
rhythms, and these can be shifted by light exposure during subjective night (entrained).47,48
This behavior depends on a tiny population of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion 
cells (ipRGCs)49—about 3% of the total ganglion cells—that express the photoprotein 
melanopsin (see also Chapter 17) and project axons to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (where 
circadian rhythms are generated)50 (see Figure 20.1). Melanopsin was first identified in 
melanocytes of frog skin and is both structurally related to rhodopsin and has similar 
light absorption characteristics.51 Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells slowly 
depolarize in response to bright light. Accumulating evidence suggests that melanopsin is 
coupled through a non-transducin G protein to phospholipase C that generates IP3 and 
diacyl-glycerol (DAG), finally to gate cation current through transient receptor potential 
(TRP)-like channels.52 This process is similar to the depolarizing phototransduction cascade 
known for invertebrates53,54 (see Figure 20.5A), but obviously differs from the process by 
which rhodopsin couples to the hyperpolarization of rods and cones. 
Synaptic Organization of the Retina
Numerous questions arise about the transmission of signals 
in the retina. How do rods and cones influence bipolar 
cells? And, how are horizontal and amacrine cells involved 
in signaling? The analysis of signal processing by these 
neurons in the outer and inner plexiform layers (Figure 
20.15) has required a combination of various techniques, 
including intracellular recording, dye injection, morpho-
logical studies, cellular neurochemistry, and identification 
of transmitters and receptors.
Bipolar, Horizontal, and Amacrine cells
From the morphological descriptions of Ramón y Cajal 
(see Figure 20.2) a general scheme for the wiring diagram 
of the retina emerges: a through-line of transmission from 
photoreceptors to ganglion cells by way of bipolar cells, 
with lateral interactions mediated through horizontal and 
amacrine cells.55,56 From the pattern of connections in 
primate retina, it is clear that the output of the eye is the 
result of complex integrative processes. For example, the 
horizontal cell shown in Figure 20.15 receives synapses 
from many receptors and in turn feeds back onto them. 
Horizontal cells also end on bipolar cells. Similarly, certain 
amacrine cells (Figure 20.16B), which receive inputs from 
bipolar cells, send synapses back to the bipolar cells as well 
as to ganglion cells. One can conclude that horizontal cells 
and amacrine cells transmit and modify signals traveling 
through the retina. An additional source of complexity is 
that each of the major classes of neurons shown in Fig-
ures 20.15 and 20.16 has numerous morphological and 
pharmacological subtypes. By physiological, biochemical,

and anatomical criteria, five major classes of bipolar cells, two or more types of horizontal 
cell, at least 20 types of amacrine cells, and more than 10 types of ganglion cells have been 
described.57,58 It is thought that all morphologically defined retinal cell types have been 
identified, with distinct functional roles assigned to nearly half of these59 making the retina 
arguably the most completely known component of the nervous system. 
Molecular Mechanisms of Synaptic Transmission in the Retina
Virtually all the known neurotransmitters have been found in the retina.60–63 Glutamate 
is the transmitter liberated by photoreceptors and bipolar cells. Horizontal cells secrete 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Some amacrine cells secrete dopamine, others indolamines, 
others acetylcholine. There are also less conventional transmitters, such as nitric oxide, that 
have been identified in retinal signaling. The distributions and functional significance of 
the transmitters, receptors, receptor subunits, and transporters have been explored in detail 
by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and pharmacology. 
Peptide transmitters also are found in the retina,64 where they are implicated in aspects 
of retinal development and disease. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) for example, is 
expressed in a subset of amacrine cells under the control of brain-derived neurotropic 
factor (BDNF)65 and VIP expression has been related to the development of myopia 
(nearsightedness).66 VIP, glucagon, and other neurotransmitters mediate communication 
between the neural retina and the retinal pigment epithelium that may participate in 
activity-dependent eyeball growth.67
The continuous, quantized release of glutamate from retinal photoreceptors and bipolar 
cells is achieved by specialized active zones known as ribbon synapses.7 An example from a 
retinal cone is shown in Figure 20.17. The cone terminal contains vesicles that are tethered 
to a long, flat electron-dense organelle—the ribbon. The ribbon structure is thought to 
reflect its specialized function: the ability to sustain high rates of vesicular release modu-

lated by changes in presynaptic voltage but without benefit of action potentials increases 
its bandwidth or frequency response. Analogous structures are found in sensory hair cells 
and may serve to concentrate vesicles near to membrane docking sites.68 In keeping with 
their functional specialization, ribbons have their own variants of the molecular elements 
in the canonical soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor, 
or SNARE, complex of neuronal synapses69 (see Chapter 13). Unique to ribbon synapses 
is the protein RIBEYE70 with unknown function but comprising perhaps two-thirds of 
the ribbon volume.71
A host of other proteins has been localized to the synaptic ribbon (Figure 20.18), also 
with limited certainty about their function. One whose identity and function is certain is 
the voltage-gated calcium channel. Ribbon synapses release continuously but also require 
rapid modulation with changes in stimulus intensity (especially for auditory hair cells, 
see Chapter 22). In contrast to standard chemical synapses where transmitter release is 
mediated by N,P/Q and R type calcium channels (see Chapter 13), ribbons are served by 
so-called L-type calcium channels with rapid gating kinetics, relatively little inactivation, 
and an activation range that spans the resting potential of the cell.72 Stochastic gating of the 
L-type channels supports the release of hundreds of vesicles per second from each ribbon, 
although how that rapid release takes place and what mechanisms ensure a steady supply 
of vesicles remain unknown. 
Receptive Fields of Retinal Neurons
The receptive field of a neuron in the visual system can be defined as the area of the retina 
for which light influences the activity of that neuron. As described in Chapter 2, our un-
derstanding of retinal receptive fields was obtained first by studying the output carried by 
the axons of retinal ganglion cells. Extracellular recording of action potentials was possible

long before intracellular electrodes were inserted into individual retinal neurons. Although 
a product of necessity, beginning with the output signal was nonetheless an excellent start-
ing point for analyzing retinal processing. Two important features were established by such 
recordings. The first was that the receptive field of a retinal ganglion cell is organized in a 
circular, center-surround manner. That is, light in the receptive field surround area produces 
an opposite effect to that in the center (see Figure 2.5).
The second essential feature obtained from ganglion cell recordings was that some retinal 
ganglion cells were excited by light in their receptive field center, the on retinal ganglion 
cells; in contrast, other ganglion cells were inhibited by light in their receptive field center, 
the off retinal ganglion cells. This dichotomy of on and off pathways is now known to be a 
fundamental property of all vertebrate retinas and establishes an organizing principle for 
higher visual centers.56 From these recordings of retinal ganglion cells, it is clear that the 
eye tells the brain about patterns of light and dark. Since photoreceptors can only report 
light intensity, it must fall to retinal interneurons to provide the analytical steps leading to 
the more structured retinal output. 
Responses of Bipolar Cells
Each bipolar cell receives its direct input either from rods or cones. Rod bipolar cells are 
typically supplied by 15 to 45 receptors. One type of cone bipolar, the midget bipolar, re-
ceives its input from a single cone. As one might expect, midget bipolar cells are found in 
the through-line from the fovea, where acuity is highest. They end on specialized ganglion 
cells. Other bipolar cells are supplied by a convergent input from 5 to 20 adjacent cones. 
H bipolar cells, like photoreceptors, are hyperpolarized by an increase in light. However, 
D bipolar cells are depolarized by light, laying the basis for the off and on output carried 
by retinal ganglion cells.
The responses and receptive fields of bipolar cells depend on two mechanisms. First, the 
continuous release of glutamate from photoreceptors in the dark keeps some bipolar cells 
depolarized and others hyperpolarized, depending on whether the cells have excitatory or 
inhibitory glutamate receptors. Second, light causes photoreceptors to be hyperpolarized, 
thereby reducing glutamate release. Accordingly, decreased tonic release from illuminated 
photoreceptors will reduce excitation of bipolar cells with excitatory (i.e., sign preserving) 
receptors, giving rise to hyperpolarization.73 These are called H (hyperpolarizing) bipolar

cells (Figure 20.19). Conversely, decreased tonic release from 
illuminated photoreceptors will give rise to depolarization of 
bipolar cells with inhibitory (i.e., sign reversing) glutamate 
receptors. These are D (depolarizing) bipolar cells. D bipolar 
cells constitute one of the few cell types in which glutamate has 
been shown to have an inhibitory action (see Chapter 14). Thus, a 
fundamental property of the visual system, on and off responses 
to light, originates in the differential response of bipolar cells to 
glutamate, determined by each cell’s glutamate receptors. 
H bipolar cells have α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole 
propionic acid (AMPA) or kainate-type cation-selective ionotropic 
glutamate receptors.74 Depolarized by glutamate released from 
photoreceptors in the dark, H bipolar cells hyperpolarize when light 
reduces glutamate release. In contrast, as Kaneko, his colleagues and 
others have shown, the hyperpolarizing transmission to D bipolar 
cells in the dark is mediated by mGluR6 metabotropic glutamate 
receptors that act through G proteins and second messengers.75,76
These close a TRP melastatin 1 (TRPM1) cation channel, which 
opens with light to depolarize the D bipolar cell.77,78
Receptive Field Organization of Bipolar Cells
The receptive field of a hyperpolarizing bipolar cell is shown in 
Figure 20.19. A small spot of light shone onto the central part of 
the field causes a sustained hyperpolarization. Illumination by 
an annulus, leaving the center dark, causes depolarization. Thus, 
the central area, driven directly by photoreceptors, is enveloped 
by an antagonistic surround. The H bipolar cell of Figure 20.19 can be described as having 
an off-center receptive field, since it is depolarized when the spot of light goes off.
D bipolar cells have similarly shaped concentric fields, except that illumination of the 
center causes depolarization and illumination of the surround causes hyperpolarization. 
Because it is depolarized when the light goes on, the D bipolar cell has an on-center receptive 
field. The terminology of on and off responses is used extensively to describe receptive field 
properties at successive levels of the visual system. An important principle is that a single 
photoreceptor can contribute to the receptive field centers of both on and off bipolar cells 
and to the surrounds of others.
Rod Bipolar Cells 
Rod bipolar cells depart from the straightforward pattern described for cone bipolar cells. 
All rod bipolar cells are on type, expressing sign-reversing inhibitory mGluR6 metabotropic 
glutamate receptors.79 Rather than contacting retinal ganglion cells directly, rod bipolar cells 
synapse onto AII amacrine cells.80 Each AII amacrine cell depolarizes due to the summed 
input of many rod bipolar cells, and in turn forms synapses onto the axon terminals of cone 
bipolar cells to influence the activity of retinal ganglion cells.81 It has been suggested that 
this indirect arrangement results from the later evolutionary arrival of rod photoreceptors 
to the vertebrate retina, piggybacking onto the preexisting cone circuitry.82 AII amacrine 
cells collect input from large numbers of rod photoreceptors, and they form electrical 
synapses onto the synaptic pedicle of on cone bipolars and make inhibitory glycinergic 
synapses with off cone bipolars.80 This connectivity suggests that rods provide a wide-field 
measure of background light levels.81 The retinal processing of rod photoreception is an 
emerging story, since there is now evidence for electrical synapses of rods with cones83
and for glutamatergic synapses of rods and cones onto some of the same bipolar cells.84,85
Horizontal Cells and Surround Inhibition
Rods and cones make synapses with bipolar cells and horizontal cells. The responses of D and

duce depolarization, while the annulus would produce hyperpolariza-
tion. (After Kaneko, 1970.)

receives inputs from a large number of photoreceptors. Horizontal cells, like H bipolar cells, 
respond to illumination of photoreceptors by hyperpolarization (because glutamate release 
from photoreceptor terminals opens depolarizing ionotropic receptors and release decreases 
with illumination). Another feature of horizontal cells is that they are electrically coupled to 
each other.86,87 Lucifer yellow dye injected into one horizontal cell spreads readily to others 
through gap junctions. Any one horizontal cell, therefore, is influenced by light shone on a 
large area of retina because of current flow from its neighbors. An interesting feature of the 
electrical synapses between horizontal cells is that they become uncoupled by dopamine.88 
Horizontal cells make inhibitory synaptic connections; they release GABA back onto the 
photoreceptors and bipolar cells.89–92 Thus, depolarization of photoreceptors in the dark is 
antagonized by inhibitory input from horizontal cells. Receptor illumination results in hori-
zontal cell hyperpolarization and a reduction in GABA release. Hence, hyperpolarization of 
photoreceptors by diffuse light is countered by a reduction in the GABA inhibition coming from 
horizontal cells. It has been suggested that nitric oxide, which is synthesized by photoreceptors 
and horizontal cells, also contributes to the inhibition of glutamate release by photoreceptors.93
In summary, there is negative feedback onto the photoreceptors through the horizontal cells:
illumination→ photoreceptor hyperpolarization→ horizontal cell hyperpolarization→ 
photoreceptor depolarization
The connections involved in the off-center/on-surround responses of an H bipolar 
cell are shown schematically in Figure 20.20. For simplicity, the center is represented by a 
single photoreceptor and the surround by a few neighboring receptors connected to a single 
horizontal cell. The response to illumination of the central photoreceptor is straightforward 
(Figure 20.20A). Photoreceptor activation results in hyperpolarization and therefore a

FIGURE 20.20 Connections of Photoreceptors, Bipolar Cells, 
and Horizontal Cells. The figure illustrates connections required to 
elicit responses in bipolar cells. (A) Light falling on a single photorecep-
tor causes it to become hyperpolarized. As a result, glutamate stops 
being released and the H bipolar cell, as in Figure 20.19, becomes hy-
perpolarized through loss of excitation. (B) Light falling on the surround-
ing area in the form of an annulus again prevents glutamate from being 
released by photoreceptors. As a result, the horizontal cell becomes 
hyperpolarized; this hyperpolarization prevents the horizontal cell from 
releasing its inhibitory transmitter, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), onto the 
photoreceptor. The photoreceptor that is connected to the H bipolar 
cell therefore becomes depolarized (through removal of inhibition). It 
once again releases glutamate and depolarizes the bipolar cell. With 
diffuse light, the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing effects cancel each 
other out. Thus, horizontal cells play an essential part in the construc-
tion of the receptive field properties of bipolar cells.

reduction in glutamate release. As a result, the bipolar cell is hyperpolarized. The horizontal 
cell receives a hyperpolarizing input as well, but it is from only one photoreceptor and the 
effect is small, as is the negative feedback onto the central photoreceptor.
The response to surround illumination involves an extra step (Figure 20.20B). The horizontal 
cell, which receives input from several photoreceptors in the surround, is hyperpolarized by 
illumination. The hyperpolarization reduces GABA release by the horizontal cell. Reduced 
inhibition of the photoreceptors tends to produce depolarization. The depolarizing feedback 
effect is minimal on the surround receptors, which are being strongly hyperpolarized by 
illumination. The central receptor, however, is receiving no illumination; its only input is 
removal of horizontal cell inhibition. Consequently, the central receptor is depolarized, release 
of glutamate is increased, and the H bipolar cell is depolarized. Comprehensive reviews and 
papers describe the morphology and the properties of photoreceptor terminals, bipolar cells, 
and the feedback synapses of horizontal cells onto bipolar cells.2,10,94,95
Significance of Receptive Field Organization of Bipolar Cells
What are the physiological implications of bipolar cell receptive fields? D and H bipolar 
cells do not simply respond to light. Rather, they begin to analyze information about pat-
terns. Their signals convey information about small spots of light surrounded by darkness 
or about small dark spots surrounded by light. They respond to contrasting patterns of 
light and dark over a small area of retina. In addition to the broad categories of D and H 
bipolar cells mentioned in the list that follows, approximately 11 types of cone bipolar cells 
have been distinguished by morphological and immunohistochemical criteria, presumably 
underlying additional functional specificity.4,96 Here we summarize three principal types.
1. D and H cone bipolar cells respond best to small light or dark spots.
2. The centers of D and H midget bipolar cells are supplied by single cones.
3. Rod bipolar cells are D, or on-center.
Receptive Fields of Ganglion Cells
The Output of the Retina
As described in Chapter 2, Stephen Kuffler pioneered the experimental analysis of the 
mammalian visual system by concentrating on the receptive field organization of retinal 
ganglion cells and the meaning of their signals in the cat. An important feature of Kuffler’s 
early experiments was the use of the intact, undissected eye—the normal refraction of 
which served as a pathway for stimulation.97 A convenient way of illuminating particular 
portions of the retina is to anesthetize the animal and place it facing a screen or monitor 
at a distance for which its eyes are properly refracted. When one then shines patterns of 
light onto the screen or displays computer-generated images, these will be well focused on 
the retinal surface (Figure 20.21). In fact, Kuffler shone light patterns into the eye directly 
by use of an ophthalmoscope.

patterns of light generated by a computer or shone by a pro-
jector. An electrode records the responses from a single cell 
in the visual pathway. Light or shadow falling onto a restricted 
area of the screen may increase or decrease the frequency of 
signals given by the neuron. One can delineate the receptive 
field of the cell by determining the areas on the screen from 
which the neuron’s firing is influenced.

Ganglion Cell Receptive Field Organization
When one records from a particular ganglion cell, the first task is to find the loca-
tion of its receptive field. Characteristically, most ganglion cells and other neurons 
at higher levels in the visual system fire at rest even in the absence of patterned illu-
mination. Appropriate stimuli do not necessarily initiate activity but may modulate 
the resting discharge; responses of ganglion cells can consist of either an increase or 
a decrease of action potential frequency.
As is the case for bipolar cells, which were first studied many years later, there are 
two basic receptive field types: on-center and off-center ganglion cells. The recep-
tive fields of both types are roughly concentric, with the ganglion cell soma in the 
geometrical center of its field. Figure 20.22, adapted from a paper by Kuffler, shows 
the response of an on retinal ganglion cell to increased light in either the center or 
the surround of its receptive field. Light produces the most vigorous response if it 
completely fills the center, whereas for most effective inhibition of firing, the light 
must cover the entire ring-shaped surround. When the inhibitory annular light is 
turned off, the ganglion cell gives an exuberant off discharge (not shown). An off-
center field has a converse organization, with inhibition arising in the circular center. 
For either cell, the spot-like center and its surround are antagonistic; therefore, if 
both center and surround are illuminated simultaneously, they tend to cancel each 
other’s contribution, although the center response prevails.
Sizes of Receptive Fields
Neighboring ganglion cells collect information from very similar, but not quite 
identical, areas of the retina. Even a small (0.1 mm) spot of light on the retina covers 
the receptive fields of many ganglion cells. Some ganglion cells are inhibited, others 
excited. This characteristic organization, with neighboring groups of receptors pro-
jecting onto neighboring ganglion cells in the retina, is retained at all levels in visual 
pathways. Throughout the visual system, the systematic analysis of the positions of 
cells and their receptive fields demonstrates the general principle that neurons pro-
cessing related information are clustered together. In sensory systems, this organiza-
tion means that the central neurons dealing with a particular area of the surface can 
communicate with each other over short distances. This avoids the necessity for long 
lines of communication and simplifies the making of connections.
The size of the receptive field of a ganglion cell depends on its location in the retina. 
The receptive fields of cells situated in the central areas of the retina have much smaller 
centers than those at the periphery; receptive fields are smallest in the fovea, where the 
acuity of vision is highest.98,99 The central on or off region of such a midget ganglion 
cell’s receptive field can be supplied by a single cone and is accordingly only about 2.5 
micrometers (μm) in diameter, subtending 0.5 minutes of arc—smaller than the period at 
the end of this sentence. Note that receptive fields can be described either as dimensions 
on the retina or as degrees of arc subtended by the stimulus. In our eyes, 1 millimeter 
(mm) on the retina corresponds to about 4°. For reference, the image of the full moon 
has a diameter of 1/8 mm on our retina, corresponding to 0.5° or 30 minutes of arc.
Classification of Ganglion Cells
Superimposed on the general scheme of on- or off-center receptive fields, ganglion cells 
in the monkey retina can be grouped into two main categories denoted as M and P. The 
criteria are both anatomical and physiological. The M and P terminology is based on the 
anatomical projections of these neurons to the lateral geniculate nucleus and from there 
to the cortex (see Chapter 2). P ganglion cells project to the four dorsal layers of smaller 
cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (the parvocellular division—parvo is Latin for small). 
M ganglion cells project to the larger cells in the two ventral layers (the magnocellular 
division—magno is Latin for large). The separate characteristics of neurons in the M and 
P pathways are maintained at successive levels in the visual system through and beyond 
the primary visual cortex. In brief, P ganglion cells (also known as midget ganglion cells)

round would reduce activity in these cells. (B)

ganglion cell slows the rate of action potential 
generation, and conversely, if directed to the 
surround would increase firing. (C) For both

diffuse light that covers both center and sur-
round produces little or no change in firing.

have small receptive field centers, high spatial resolution, and most are sensitive to color. 
P cells provide information about fine detail but require higher contrast stimuli.100,96
M cells (also known as parasol ganglion cells because of the shapes of their more extensive 
dendritic arbors, which collect wider inputs) have larger receptive fields than P cells and are 
more sensitive to small differences in contrast and to movement. M cells fire phasically at 
higher frequencies and conduct impulses more rapidly along their larger-diameter axons 
than do P cells along their smaller-diameter axons. In the cat, which has no color vision and 
has a single type of cone, the classification of ganglion cells is different, with X, Y, and W 
groups.101 X, Y, and W systems of the cat are also concerned with discrimination of patterns 
and movement but show marked differences from the primate M and P classification.102
In rabbits, ganglion cells show directional sensitivity to movement.103 The magnocellular/
parvocellular classification in the primate visual system provides a convenient and useful 
framework for studying pathways and properties, and reflects functionally distinct processing.
Synaptic Inputs to Ganglion Cells Responsible 
for Receptive Field Organization
Inputs to ganglion cells from bipolar and amacrine cells occur in the inner plexiform layer 
(see Figure 20.15), which has been further subdivided into at least 10 layers according to 
the terminations of bipolar and amacrine cells on the ganglion cell dendrites. A fuller 
description of the intricate connections from photoreceptors to ganglion cells is given in 
lucid and complementary reviews by Sterling2 and a more recent summary by Wu.104 As 
might be expected, depolarizing on-center and hyperpolarizing off-center cone bipolar cells 
make excitatory glutamatergic synapses with corresponding on- and off-center ganglion 
cells. Consequently, the change in membrane potential of a bipolar cell causes the ganglion 
cell to which it is connected to change its membrane potential in the same direction. The 
axons of on-center bipolar cells terminate closer to the ganglion cell layer than do the off-
center bipolar cells, and bipolar cells for the P pathway are separate from those for the M 
pathway. As previously described, transmission from rod bipolar cells to ganglion cells is 
indirect, by way of a special type of amacrine cell (known as the AII amacrine cell).4,85 The 
connections are so precise that both rods and cones in the same part of the retina supply 
the same ganglion cell appropriately, but generally by way of different interposed cells. The 
precision of these connections also is reflected in the arborization pattern of each ganglion 
cell type (Figure 20.23). On and off ganglion cells each establish specific dendritic patterns 
so that each functional class optimally covers the retinal surface.81
Amacrine Cell Control of Ganglion Cell Responses
Because there are nearly 30 different types of amacrine cells in the mammalian retina, 
the rod amacrine cells represent only a subset. Although the relative proportions of the 
various types differ between species, amacrine cells mediate or contribute to a variety of 
FIGURE 20.23 Dendritic Arborization Pattern of On 
Ganglion Cells in the cat retina labeled with antibody to 
neurofilament. The cell bodies form a regular mosaic, and their 
dendritic trees cover the retinal field without leaving gaps and 
without extensive overlap. Other anatomically and functionally 
defined classes of ganglion cells provide equivalent retinal cover-
age, so that multiple parallel channels process information about 
light at each location on the retina. (After Wässle, 2004.)

distinctive types of responses and receptive field properties of retinal ganglion cells.105,106
Many of these effects are what might be called dynamic, or changing, and depend upon the 
variable range of stimulus intensity, stimulus movement relative to the background scene, 
or spatial asymmetries in that pattern. For example, together with bipolar cells, amacrine 
cells show an early stage of processing called contrast adaptation or contrast gain control, 
which rapidly affects the contrast sensitivity of the ganglion cell, so that the cell can give 
a full range of responses to the changes in illumination intensity it experiences within a 
timeframe of seconds.107 This works a little like the contrast adjustments that can be made 
to digital photographs but on a second-by-second basis, over time.
A retinal ganglion cell’s receptive field can also change dynamically in a way that maxi-
mizes the cell’s sensitivity to spatial features that differ from a surrounding pattern.108 An 
example is a cell that can improve its ability to detect an object in a patterned field, such as 
among tall tree trunks in a forest, as compared to a less regular background. Experiments 
and modeling have shown that amacrine cells, with their lateral projections, and bipolar 
cells contribute to the effect, which has been termed predictive coding.
Although in primates most sensitivity to the direction of movement of stimuli is 
thought to arise through cortical or tectal connections, there are retinal ganglion cells (as 
shown particularly in rabbits) that detect movement direction. In rabbits it is the starburst 
amacrine cells that account for sensitivity to direction of movement,109,110 and starburst 
amacrine cells with similar properties are found in primates including humans.111,112 Eye 
movements cause the entire visual field to move. As a compensatory mechanism, some 
retinal ganglion cells are wired to respond preferentially to the movement of a small object 
relative to overall movement of the visual field. Experiments and related modeling indicate 
that certain amacrine cells provide the processing and connections for sensing such rela-
tive motion of objects in a moving field of vision.113,114 For the larger movements called 
saccades, which are associated with shifting gaze, visual perception is suppressed in part 
because of central control that is exerted by oculomotor centers, but in addition, some 
retinal ganglion cell responses are suppressed,115 apparently by the circuitry that detects 
global eye movements. Finally, signaling to retinal ganglion cells by a moving stimulus 
reaches the edge of each ganglion cell’s dendritic field before illuminating the cell body; a 
change in cell sensitivity as a result of the stimulus causes the population of firing ganglion 
cells to lead the stimulus in what is called motion anticipation.116 
What Information Do Ganglion Cells Convey?
It should be clear that ganglion cell signals tell a different story from that of primary sensory 
receptors. The sizes, shapes, and dynamic properties of their receptive fields are tuned to de-
tect spatial, temporal, or color contrast, and like bipolar cells from which they derive input, 
half of the ganglion cells depolarize in response to light. Their synaptic inputs tune them 
to detect stimuli like the edge of an image crossing the opposing regions of their receptive 
field. As detailed in Chapter 2, from this starting point, higher order neurons in the visual 
system construct lines, corners, and all the features that underlie visual object recognition. 
And a very few ganglion cells provide information about the level of ambient illumination.
Throughout the previous discussion, the spike trains from individual neurons have 
been treated as separate lines from which the brain analyses visual input. Since the firing of 
ensembles of retinal ganglion cells is crucial for the next levels of analysis into the cortex, 
some studies have compared activity within groups of ganglion cells and identified additional 
roles of amacrine cells.117,118 Experiments made in the salamander retina by Baylor, Meister, 
and their colleagues suggest that the temporal aspects of firing by ganglion cells also can 
contribute to retinal analysis.119,120 Thus, when recordings were made simultaneously from 
ganglion cells with closely adjacent fields, action potentials occurred synchronously for 
some visual stimuli. For example, a spot of light that straddled the border of two off-center 
retinal ganglion cells produced synchronous firing. Electrical synapses between amacrine 
and ganglion cells or between ganglion cells are thought to contribute to coordinated firing, 
referred to as concerted signaling of ganglion cells.121,122
It is appropriate to close this chapter with a quotation from Sherrington, written 
long before receptive fields were mapped for single cells. Unlike that of Helmholtz, 
Sherrington’s somewhat opaque style often makes it difficult to read his profoundly

original papers and books. Yet, the following paragraph reveals his poetic insight into 
the physiology of vision: 
The chief wonder of all we have not touched on yet. Wonder of wonders, though 
familiar even to boredom. So much with us that we forget it all the time. The eye 
sends, as we saw, into the cell-and-fibre forest of the brain throughout the waking 
day continual rhythmic streams of tiny, individual evanescent, electrical potentials. 
This throbbing streaming crowd of electrified shifting points in the sponge-work of 
the brain bears no obvious semblance in space-pattern, and even in temporal relation 
resembles but a little remotely the tiny two-dimensional upside-down picture of the 
outside world which the eye-ball paints on the beginnings of its nerve-fibres to elec-
trical storm. And the electrical storm so set up is one which affects a whole popula-
tion of brain-cells. Electrical charges having in themselves not the faintest elements 
of the visual—having, for instance, nothing of “distance,” “right-side-upness,” no 
“vertical,” nor “horizontal,” nor “color,” nor “brightness,” nor “shadow,” nor “round-
ness,” nor “squareness,” nor “contour,” nor “transparency,” nor “opacity,” nor “near,” 
nor “far,” nor visual anything—yet conjure up all these. A shower of little electri-
cal leaks conjures up for me, when I look, the landscape; the castle on the height, or 
when I look at him, my friend’s face and how distant he is from me they tell me. Tak-
ing their word for it, I go forward and my other senses confirm that he is there.123

■ CHAPTER 21
Touch, Pain, and 
Texture Sensation
T
he entire body surface is covered with tactile receptors. In this way, the somatosensory 
system differs from sensory systems whose receptors are clustered within organs, such 
as the eye, nose, or ear. The sensory system of the skin is essential for identifying shapes 
and textures; for recognizing, grasping, and manipulating objects; for registering temperature; for 
directing visual attention; and for avoiding dangerous objects signaled by the pain they evoke. In 
this chapter, we describe the processing that leads from contact of an object with the skin to rec-
ognition of the physical properties of that object. The functional organization of the somatosensory 
system is addressed both in rats and mice, where the whiskers are particularly important, and in 
primates, where the fingertips are particularly important.
Most somatosensory nerve fibers terminate in tiny accessory structures distributed in differ-
ent positions within the skin—hair follicles, or Meissner, Merkel, Pacinian, or Ruffini’s corpuscles. 
But, there is another class of fibers that ends with no accessory structure—the so-called free 
nerve endings. Each type of fiber is activated by a specific stimulus and leads to a characteristic 
sensation. The terminations in accessory structures are associated with touch, pressure, stretch, 
or vibration; free nerve endings are associated with hot or cold, painful or itchy sensations. The 
connection between receptor activity and sensation was first posited from studies in anesthetized 
animals, but it has been confirmed by recording from single nerve fibers in the arm of awake, hu-
man subjects, who describe the feeling evoked by electrical stimulation of the fiber.
Signals travel to the spinal cord, where they are sorted out into distinct ascending pathways ac-
cording to the functional category of the receptor. All pathways reach the cerebral cortex after multi-
ple relays. Though stimuli that cause damage lead to activation of a specific pathway, the subjective 
experience of pain is more complex than the mere perceptual consequence of such activity. For this 
reason, the psychological state of a person, including the expectation of reduced pain (placebo) or 
of intense pain (nocebo) truly alters the degree of suffering. The modulation occurs through endog-
enous opioid mechanisms. 
At all levels of the somatosensory pathways, neurons are arranged into topographic maps 
where the spatial relationships of the body are conserved: adjacent stimuli activate adjacent neu-
rons. These maps are grossly distorted because larger territories in the central nervous system 
(CNS) are dedicated to smaller, more densely innervated skin areas. The representation of the 
whiskers in mice and rats is one notable example. The whiskers are represented in layer IV of cor-
tex by an oversized grid of columns, called barrels. All the neurons in one barrel respond to move-
ment of one whisker on the opposite side of the face. In humans and other primates, the fingertips 
are densely innervated, providing the tactile input necessary for object manipulation. The corre-
sponding magnification of the fingertips (and lips) in somatosensory cortex gives rise to distorted 
cortical representations. Cortical map topography can be altered by manipulations during devel-
opment, but also throughout life by training in sensory discrimination tasks.
A detailed account of sensory processing, from the skin receptor to the somatosensory cortex, 
has been established to explain the perception of texture. To identify textures, rats palpate an 

434 Chapter 21
object with brief touches of their whiskers. The way that the whiskers skip along the 
surface varies according to the surface’s roughness. Whisker motion is converted 
to spike trains by receptor neurons—the coarser the surface, the greater the rate 
of neuronal firing. The signals ascend to the barrel cortex, where the neuronal firing 
rate determines the animal’s judgment of texture. In primates, there are two chan-
nels for sensing texture. The perception of coarse textural features relies on a spa-
tial mechanism—at any given instant, the degree of roughness can be decoded by 
a “snapshot” of the contrast in firing among slowly adapting neurons with nearby 
receptive fields. The perception of finely textured surfaces is determined by the 
efficacy with which finger motion along them excites the nerve terminations in the 
Pacinian corpuscles. The vibration mechanism in primates has much in common 
with the mechanism by which the whiskers extract surface properties.

Touch receptors are mechanoreceptors: they transduce mechanical energy applied to the 
skin into the language of the nervous system; that is, sequences of action potentials. The 
key to understanding this first stage of the somatic sensation is to know that each type of 
touch receptor is sensitive to particular features of mechanical energy and insensitive to 
all other features. This is because morphological specializations—usually the structures 
encapsulating the nerve fiber termination—make that ending respond selectively to one 
specific type of stimulus. The capsular structures are deformed by mechanical stimuli, and 
thereby transmit skin deformation to the nerve terminal (Figure 21.1). A single sensory 
fiber arriving from the spinal cord can branch to innervate from a few to tens of separate 
capsules in the skin. All capsules innervated by one fiber are of the same type.

FIGURE 21.1 Section of Skin Showing the Morphology and 
Position of Tactile Receptors. This figure refers to glabrous skin 
(meaning hairless, such as the skin of the palms) in primates. The 
Meissner, Pacinian, and Ruffini’s corpuscles as well as Merkel’s 
disc are all specialized structures that filter the mechanical energy 
that excites the nerve termination. The free nerve endings are—as 
the name implies—uncovered, which exposes them to substances 
released by the skin tissues.

Touch, Pain, and Texture Sensation 435
The Pacinian corpuscle is an intriguing example of how the capsular structure selects the 
features that reach the nerve termination through the surrounding tissue, and it is described 
in detail in Chapter 19. Merkel’s disc is another structure that filters mechanical energy. It is 
a small epithelial cell found under the fingerprint ridges. It transmits compressive strain to 
the sensory nerve ending. The responses are sustained during the period of pressure, with 
firing frequency proportional to the pressure applied to the skin.1 Another structure, Ruffini’s 
corpuscle, is activated by pressure or compression.2 These endings are located deeper in 
the skin and have the greatest density at the base of the 
fingernails, in the tissue overlying joints and ligaments, 
as well as in the palm.3 Both the Ruffini complex (the 
corpuscle together with the nerve termination) and the 
Merkel complex (the disc together with the nerve ter-
mination) are slowly adapting structures and transmit 
information about how firmly your hand is grasping an 
object or how hard your foot is pressing on the floor.
Meissner’s corpuscle in the skin of the lips, palm, 
fingers, and sole of the foot confers upon the nerve 
terminals extraordinary mechanical sensitivity to ini-
tial contact and to motion. The receptor complex is a 
rapidly adapting structure and is strongly activated by 
low-frequency vibrations, up to 50 Hz.4 Application 
of local anesthesia to the superficial skin layers, which 
affects nerve terminations in Meissner’s corpuscles but 
not in Pacinian corpuscles, diminishes the sense of low-
frequency vibration but not high-frequency vibration.5
The receptive fields—the area of skin in which stimu-
lation evokes a response—of Meissner’s and Merkel’s 
receptors are small, a few millimeters (mm) in diameter, 
while those of Pacinian and Ruffini receptors are several 
centimeters (cm) in diameter. Most stimuli activate many 
kinds of receptors at once, so that impulses from dif-
ferent classes signal different aspects of the stimulus.6 
For example, if you grasp a vibrating cell phone in your 
hand, pressure and vibration sensory channels will be 
activated in parallel.
Hair follicles are innervated by a network of nerve 
terminals with different morphologies and different 
positions along the hair shaft and the wall of the follicle. 
A small hair follicle, like that present in the mammalian 
skin, is illustrated in Figure 21.2A, while a large whisker 
follicle,7 like that on the snout of a rat or mouse, is il-
lustrated in Figure 21.2B. The whisker is a special hair 
that will be discussed later in the chapter. The nerve 
endings are excited when the hair is bent, vibrated, 
or pulled. It is not yet known how the selectivity of 
individual endings varies according to morphology 
and position within the follicle.

Nerve terminations enter through the superficial vibrissal nerve and the deep vibris-

bending, pulling, etc.). As in the case of the unspecialized skin hair in (A), the muscle 
wrapped around the follicle (not shown) contracts to erect the hair; however in the

sory signals. (B courtesy of Frank Rice.)

Another class of receptor is a free nerve ending—one that is not connected to any 
specialized capsule or structure (see Figure 21.1). Through a variety of specialized chemi-
cal transduction mechanisms, described in Chapter 19, the free nerve endings generate 
impulses leading to sensation of pain, temperature, itch, or tickle.6,8,9
Anatomy of Receptor Neurons
Receptor neurons have three components: (1) a cell body that lies in a dorsal root gan-
glion situated in the aperture between the vertebrae of the spine, (2) a central branch that 
joins a dorsal root and projects into the spinal cord, and (3) a peripheral branch that joins 
other fibers in a peripheral nerve and then terminates as the specialized receptor complex 
discussed in the previous section (Figure 21.3). The longest of these peripheral axons, 
stretching from the cell body to receptor endings in the toe, exceeds 1 meter in length in 
humans and 3 meters in giraffes.
The previous summary applies to the innervation of the skin of the hands, feet, arms, 
legs, and trunk. For the skin of the face, the cell bodies are in the trigeminal ganglion 
(instead of the dorsal root ganglion) situated lateral to the brainstem; fibers projecting to 
the skin travel in the trigeminal nerve—the fifth cranial nerve—and the central processes 
from these ganglion cells terminate in the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem.
Because sensory neurons carry signals over long distances, transmission of informa-
tion to second-order neurons cannot be accomplished by a graded potential like that of 
the photoreceptor (see Chapter 19). Instead, action potentials are generated very close 
to the nerve terminal and they travel past the ganglion cell soma and into the spinal 
cord or brainstem.
Sensations Evoked by Afferent Signals
An increase in the understanding of touch sensation has come from the method of micro-
neurography in human subjects.10 A fine metal microelectrode is advanced through the 
skin of the arm and into a nerve, which contains fibers traveling from the hand to the spi-
nal cord. This set-up allows the investigator to record the impulses in conscious subjects 
while applying a stimulus to the skin and, at the same time, to monitor the subject’s sensa-
tions (Figure 21.4). Most fibers have little or no spontaneous activity and fire only when 
the skin is stimulated. Both the receptive field of a single human nerve fiber as well as the 
type of stimulus that is most effective in evoking an action potential conforms exactly to 
those previously identified in laboratory animals.11 A single fiber is sensitive to one or a 
few distinct skin spots, and their size varies according to receptor submodality. A fiber is 
sensitive to just one submodality—for instance, light pressure, or low-frequency vibration, 
or high-frequency vibration.12
The advantage over animal neurophysiology lies in the fact that the subject can describe 
what he or she feels. From this came the discovery that electrical stimulation of a single fiber 
innervating a mechanoreceptor can evoke an elementary sensation that is experienced as 
tapping, vibration, or pressure. The sensation feels as if it is occurring at the receptive field 
location of that fiber. Varying the frequency of impulse generation causes a change in the 
magnitude of the sensation. For example, increasing the stimulation frequency increases 
the intensity of perceived pressure.

In order for the subject to feel a sensation of pain, impulses are required from many 
fibers arising from nociceptive free nerve endings, an integrative process known as spatio-
temporal summation. Above threshold, the intensity of pain is correlated with the number 
of action potentials.13
Microneurography studies confirm the stimulus-specificity of afferent fibers. In addition, 
they confirm that the activity of a single primary afferent fiber can produce a conscious 
sensation.14,15 The threshold of single fibers (i.e., the strength of skin indentation required 
to excite impulses) matches the subjects’ threshold for detecting the same stimulus.15 We 
can deduce that transmission from skin to cerebral cortex is highly reliable, as in vision, 
and that impulses are delivered from the periphery into a low-noise central processing 
network: if the network were active in the absence of stimuli, the arrival of impulses from 
one fiber could not be readily detected. Of course, single-fiber activation is not a normal 
mode of operation—contact with objects produces activity patterns that are complex with 
respect to time and space. But the signals carried by single fibers constitute the elemental 
building blocks for meaningful somatic sensations.
Ascending Pathways
Receptor type, and therefore submodality, is correlated with the diameter of the afferent fiber 
and its myelination. As discussed in Chapter 8, diameter and myelination determine conduc-
tion velocity. Fibers that carry signals conveying information about light (i.e., non-painful) 
touch are myelinated and have conduction velocities up to about 60 meters/second (m/s); 
this class of fiber is called A-β. Fibers that carry signals about painful stimuli and temperature 
have conduction velocities from 2–10 m/s (A-δ fibers; myelinated) down to 0.2–2 m/s (C fi-
bers; unmyelinated). Microneurography shows that activity in A-δ fibers is associated with a 
rapid stinging or pricking sensation called first pain, whereas activity in C fibers is associated 
with a burning or aching sensation called second pain. The faster pain fibers (A-δ) are also

responsible for reflexes, and this explains how you can jerk your hand away from a pot handle 
just an instant before you have any sensation of your hand being burned (see Chapter 24 for 
discussion of such reflexes). Thermoreceptors are innervated by C fibers. Local anesthetic 
agents first block mainly C-fiber activity, suppressing pain and temperature sense while leav-
ing tactile sensibility largely intact.
A fundamental principle of the somatosensory system is that chains of neurons with dif-
ferent functional properties follow distinct pathways to the thalamus and, hence, to the cerebral 
cortex. Signals travel to the spinal cord, where they enter one of two ascending pathways, ac-
cording to the functional category of the receptor. As shown in Appendix B, neuronal activity 
correlated with sensations such as touch and pressure are carried in dorsal column pathways, 
while neuronal activity correlated with pain and temperature ascend in the spinothalamic tract.
Within the central nervous system, somatosensory impulse traffic does not move in 
only one direction, from nerve terminal to brain; instead, the CNS also sends messages in 
the reverse direction. Thus, ascending somatosensory pathways are influenced by descending 
pathways—projections from each level cascade down to preceding levels. Somatosensory 
cortical areas project densely to the same thalamic, brainstem, and spinal cord sites from 
which they receive afferent signals. As in the visual system (see Chapters 2 and 3), the 
precise functions of these feedback connections are not yet known. In general terms, they 
modulate ascending sensory transmission, facilitating or inhibiting the incoming flow of 
information. The feedback effects can be highly focused in time and location. For instance, 
the perception of touch on the skin of the hand is reduced as the arm reaches for an object 
and then is amplified as the hand palpates its target.16
Somatosensory Cortex
The first stage of cortical processing of somatosensory signals occurs in the anterior pari-
etal region, that is, the area targeted by axons from the thalamic ventroposterior nucleus. 
In primates, input from low-threshold cutaneous receptors—light pressure and vibra-
tion—projects to a medial-lateral strip along the crown of the postcentral gyrus, area 
3b in Brodmann’s terminology (see Appendix C). A second target of cutaneous inputs is 
area 1, a strip immediately posterior to area 3b. Input from proprioceptors projects to a 
medial-lateral strip at the anterior border of the somatosensory field (Brodmann’s area 3a, 
just behind motor cortex) and a strip at the posterior border (area 2). These areas together 
are known as primary somatosensory cortex (SI), though Kaas17 argues that only area 3b 
should be considered primary somatosensory cortex. Their arrangement 
is illustrated in the Figure 21.5. There is disagreement as to whether the 
four areas carry out hierarchical processing or parallel processing. In the 
first view, areas 1 and 2 integrate inputs from areas 3a and 3b to gener-
ate complex, higher-order response properties, while in the second view 
each of the four areas operates, independently, on its own thalamic input.
Lesions to SI in humans result in a loss of touch sensation on the 
contralateral side of the body. Although some sensations of touch are 
eventually restored, the ability to discriminate shape and texture is disrupted 
permanently.18–20 Spatially restricted lesions can be made in animals to 
provide clearer insights into the sensory functions of specific cytoarchitec-
tonic fields. In monkeys, lesions confined to area 3b produce the severest

sagittal section, upper plot) are 3a, 3b, 1, and 2. Area 3b receives dense input from the 
core of the thalamic ventral posterior nucleus, receiving signals related to light touch. The 
other somatosensory areas receive less dense thalamic input, arising from shell areas sur-
rounding the ventral posterior nucleus core. Area 1, like area 3b, receives signals related 
to light touch, while areas 3a and 2 receive signals related to deeper tissues and joints. 
Areas 4 and 5 are regions that receive dense projections from the adjacent somatosen-
sory cortex and use the information for different functions. Area 4 is part of motor cortex 
(see Chapter 24), while area 5 integrates somatosensory information with that of other 
sensory modalities to create a percept of the body in relation to surrounding space.

Pain Perception and its Modulation
The various forebrain regions that play a part in processing nociceptive signals have been 
identified, but their specific roles have been debated since the early 1900s. Most investi-
gators distinguish between lateral and medial networks. The lateral system, whose main 
components are the lateral regions of thalamus and primary (SI) and secondary somato-
sensory cortices (SII), is believed to be involved in processing the sensory discriminative 
aspects of pain. This system specifies where on the body the sensation arises and, according 
to the nature of the sensation, what might be the cause. A nociceptive pathway to SI has 
been traced and some of its neurons do respond to noxious stimuli.23 Also, SI activation 
increases in relation to the subjective strength of a painful stimulus, according to functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies.24–26 However, neurosurgical ablation of SI 
has effects on the perception of pain that vary widely across subjects. 
The medial system, whose main components are the medial regions of the thalamus, 
and the insular, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortices, is believed to be involved in 
processing the affective, motivational aspects of pain.27 Ablation of these regions of cortex 
profoundly reduces the subjective unpleasantness of noxious stimuli. Moreover, the strength 
of activation of these areas, observed by brain imaging, is correlated with the judgment of 
how distressing the pain sensation is.26
Although “pain pathways” from the skin have been identified,28 it is incorrect to suppose 
that a specified quantity of nociceptor impulses travels in an uninterrupted stream to the 
cerebral cortex to produce a proportional quantity of pain. Rather, a given level of nociceptor 
activation can produce dramatically different subjective experiences under different condi-
tions. A soldier charging into battle may not even notice injuries that would, under other 
circumstances, produce exceptional pain. At the opposite end of the spectrum, a chronic pain 
syndrome can exist even without abnormal activity in skin nociceptors.29 It is the central 
processing of nociceptor signals, not their mere presence, that gives rise to the sensory and 
affective experience. Understanding pain thus requires understanding how the stream of 
impulses arriving from the nociceptors is processed by the rest of the nervous system. And, 
as pointed out by Melzack,30 the subjective experience of pain—more than any other experi-
ence originating in a sensory organ—is modulated by social, cultural, and personal factors.
The discovery in the 1970s of endogenous opioid receptors in the brain31–33 implied the 
existence of brain systems whose normal function would be to modulate the processing of 
nociceptive signals. The endogenous system acts by the release of peptides (known as en-
dorphins) in the spinal cord and in other regions of the central nervous system, where they 
inhibit neuronal activity in the pain pathway. The name endorphin comes from the fact that 
they are endogenous and that their chemical structure resembles that of the opiate painkiller 
morphine. Endorphins act through three major receptors: μ, δ, and κ. The receptor types can 
be distinguished according to the chemical substance for which they have greatest affinity; for 
instance, the most effective agonist for the μ-opioid receptors is the opium alkaloid, morphine.
Can we control the operation of the endogenous pain modulation system and thereby 
suppress chronic pain that has outlived its usefulness as an alarm bell? Can we reduce 
dependence on addictive painkillers? Recent research shows that placebo treatment—the 
suggestion of pain reduction without medication or functional treatment—can effectively 
reduce even a postoperative pain experience.34 Placebo functions by activating opioid 
receptors35,36 and placebo-evoked pain suppression is eliminated by blocking μ-opioid 
receptors.37 Functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments show that the effectiveness 
of suggestion in reducing subjective pain is positively correlated with the degree of sup-
pression of activity in anterior cingulate and insular cortex.38,39 Thus, placebo acts directly 
on the networks that normally generate the unpleasant experience of pain. A fascinating 
finding is that the expectation of a negative outcome can cause an intensification of pain 
sensations and can cause even a normally innocuous stimulus to be felt as painful.40 This 
nocebo effect occurs by driving the endogenous opioidergic system in the opposite direc-
tion of the placebo effect.

Somatosensory System Organization and Texture 
Sensation in Rats and Mice
The Whiskers of Mice and Rats
How do impulses from skin receptors eventually lead to the sensation (i.e., the registration 
of the elemental properties) and perception (i.e., recognition of the identity and mean-
ing of the sensation) of the things that we contact? As a first example, we use the sensory 
pathways originating in the whiskers of mice and rats to illustrate the main principles of 
the organization and function of touch. We then show how these principles apply to sen-
sation and perception in primates. 
Mice and rats are active in dark environments and have poor vision; their survival depends 
on the sense of touch. Through the whiskers, the brain builds up percepts of objects: their 
position, size, shape, and texture.41 The heart of the tactile system is an array of some 35 long 
whiskers on each side of the face, thick hairs that the animal flicks forward and backward 
(there are also shorter, and less mobile hairs packed densely around the nose and lips that the 
animal can use to collect additional information).42 Contact with an object activates mecha-
noreceptor terminations located in the whisker follicles, giving rise to neuronal signals (see 
Figure 21.2B). The first study to utilize the whiskers as an object of research was carried out 
by S. Vincent in 1912 for her Ph.D thesis at the University of Chicago (using rats captured in 
the city!).43 She built an elevated labyrinth and found that the time required to run from the 
start to the end of the maze and the number of errors (for example, stepping into dead-end 
arms) increased dramatically when whiskers were clipped. The rats were slowed by the need 
to feel the edge of the platforms with their feet rather than with their whiskers.
Magnification Factor
The behavioral importance of the rodents’ whiskers goes hand in hand with the richness 
of the skin innervation. The whisker pad is the most densely supplied skin area of the body 
studied so far—about 200 trigeminal ganglion neurons innervate each whisker follicle.44 In 
Figure 21.6A, it is evident that the primary somatosensory cortex occupies a greater territory

than do the primary sensory fields for vision and audition. And within primary somatosen-
sory cortex, the whisker field is disproportionately large. Although this can be interpreted 
as a greater magnification of the whiskers’ cortical representation with respect to that of 
other body parts (i.e., in terms of square millimeters of skin projecting to square millime-
ters of cortical surface), it can also be interpreted as conservation, across body areas, of the 
relationship between receptor density and cortical territory. In other words, the number of 
tactile receptors projecting to each square millimeter of cortical surface is held constant. 
As a result, the richly innervated whisker follicles gain a large territory.
Topographic Map of the Whiskers and Columnar Organization
To visualize the organization of the mouse somatosensory cortex, Woolsey and van der 
Loos45 separated the cerebral cortex from the underlying structures. Then, they flattened the 
curved cortex between two slides and sectioned the slab in a tangential plane that yielded 
a large horizontal expanse of layer IV in a single section. Once the tissue was stained, dis-
tinct clusters of densely packed neurons were visible. The grid-like arrangement of the 35 
clusters resembled wine casks, calling out for the name barrels (Figure 21.6B). The insight 
of Woolsey and van der Loos was that the spatial arrangement of the barrels replicates 
exactly the spatial arrangement of the whiskers on the snout. The authors concluded that 
the barrel field is a map of the whiskers on the contralateral snout. Every whisker on the 
snout was given a label (e.g., D3) and could be readily matched with one cortical barrel 
(again, D3). Within a few years, the prediction of a connection from each whisker to its 
own cortical barrel was extended from mice to rats and confirmed by many physiological 
studies.46–49 Thus, the receptive fields of the neurons in barrel D3 are centered on the so-
called principal whisker, D3. Whiskers surrounding the principal whisker may also excite 
cells to a lesser degree. Neurons in the layers above and below layer IV, which receive their 
main sensory input from layer IV, also receive a strong input from the principal whisker.46
So, the neuronal population extending through all layers forms a cortical column associ-
ated with a single whisker, a functional unit anchored by the layer IV barrel.
Because two whiskers that are adjacent to each other on the animal’s face are repre-
sented in adjacent cortical barrels, the barrel field constitutes a topographic map (Figure 
21.6C). Beyond the special case of whiskers, it is common to refer to a brain representation 
as a “map” whenever the spatial relationship among sensory receptors is conserved in the 
central representation of the sense organ. A historical note on the discovery of cortical 
somatosensory maps is given in Box 21.1.
The map of cortical columns serves to organize the storage of sensory experiences. One 
demonstration is provided by an experiment in which, to begin, all whiskers except one 
were trimmed from the snout of the rats (Figure 21.7A). Then, the animals were trained, 
in the dark, to perch on one platform, extend the intact whisker across a gap to touch 
and, thus, localize a second platform, and jump across the gap to reach a reward. Next, 
the trained whisker was clipped off and a previously clipped whisker was fixed with glue 
to a different whisker stub (Figure 21.7B). When retested, the number of trials necessary 
to reacquire the task was found to increase as a function of the distance between the site 
of the trained whisker and the new (i.e., attached) whisker (Figure 21.7C). Moreover, the 
transfer of learning between any two whisker locations was perfectly explained by the 
spatial distribution of physiological activity within the barrel field map (Figure 21.7D). 
This experiment suggests the presence of a sensory memory trace governed by the precise 
topography of the sensory receptors.50
Map Development and Plasticity
When a strain of mice is bred to have different numbers of whiskers, the barrel field dif-
fers in precise correspondence with the face; thus, extra whiskers (or missing whiskers) 
are accompanied by extra (or missing) barrels in the matching part of the barrel field.51,52
Destruction at birth of a whisker follicle will cancel that whisker’s module from all maps 
in the ascending sensory pathway.53 But once the anatomical connection between one 
whisker and its corresponding cortical barrel is established a few days after birth, that bar-
rel remains fixed throughout life.

The topographic map at the level of cortex is not generated ad hoc from a disordered 
input—rather, all along the pathway, the neighboring relations are received in an orderly 
manner from the preceding level (the descending feedback projections mentioned earlier in 
the chapter respect the same topographic order). Each barrel receives input from a discrete 
barreloid in the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus; each thalamic barreloid 
receives input from a barrelette in the brainstem trigeminal nucleus; and each barrelette 
receives input from a whisker. During development the modular clustering appears in a 
temporal sequence from periphery to cortex.54
Although the principal input to a given barrel is its topographically matched whisker, 
neurons do respond to stimulation of neighboring whiskers, particularly in the column 
of neurons above and below the layer IV barrel. These inputs form the surround receptive

FIGURE 21.7 Role of the Cortical Whisker Map in Sensory 
Learning. (A) In the gap-crossing task, the rat learned to identify, in 
the dark, the location of a reward platform by making contact using 
a single whisker, referred to as the “trained whisker.” In this drawing, 
first it leans into the gap (upper sketch) and then it extends forward 
to reach the target (lower sketch). (B) The trained whisker (left) was 
clipped off (middle) and a different whisker was fixed to a whisker 
stump some specific distance from the stump of the trained whisker 
(prosthetic whisker, right). (C) Schematic depiction of the whisker grid. 
The speed at which the rat relearned the gap-crossing task depended 
on the distance from the site of the trained whisker (T) to the site of 
attachment of the new whisker, indicating that learning was localized. 
(D) In the upper three plots, the number of action potentials (spikes 
per trial) evoked by separate, brief movements of three different whis-
kers (D2, C2, and B2) is illustrated. The responses were measured 
across a 10 × 10 grid of microelectrodes placed in the barrel cortex; 
electrode positions are designated by gray dots. The lower two plots 
indicate the degree of overlap in the cortical representation between 
whisker pairs (D2 × C2, and D2 × B2). This is calculated by multiply-
ing the separate responses to the two whiskers at each electrode; 
thus the response scale is (spikes squared per trial) squared. Cortical 
overlap is higher for the closer whisker pair (D2 × C2) than for the 
more widely separated whisker pair (D2 × B2). The key result is that 
the exact quantity of cortical overlap between the representations of 
any two whiskers perfectly accounts for the degree of learning trans-
fer between those two whisker sites. (After Harris et al., 1999.)

Variation across Species in Cortical Maps
The expanded representations of particularly sensitive body 
areas and their locations within distorted maps were de-
scribed by Adrian beginning in the 1920s in work that opened 
the modern epoch in the study of somatosensory cortex. The 
experiments were accomplished by stimulating skin sites while 
picking up potentials, summated across millions of neurons, 
through electrodes (tiny spheres of copper) placed on the 
cortical surface. The line of research was continued by Clinton 
Woolsey through the 1950s, until microelectrode methods 
took over. Comparing the cortical skin representation across 
numerous species, these pioneers found fascinating species-
specific maps. Recently, a particularly remarkable cortical map 
has been discovered: the representation of the pink fleshy 
appendages, called rays, ringing the snout of the star-nosed 
mole. These densely innervated tactile probes, which the 
animal uses to find worms, have an enormous topographically 
organized cortical representation.

field. Throughout life, the weighting of the inputs from principal and surround whiskers 
remains plastic, shifting according to the animal’s sensory experience. For example, if 
some whiskers are trimmed short and others left intact, cortical neurons become more 
responsive to the whiskers that the animal uses and less responsive to the clipped ones. This 
form of map plasticity has been attributed mainly to the activity-dependent modification 
of intracortical synaptic connections.55–57
Plastic reorganization of the cortical somatosensory map is also at work in regions 
beyond the whisker representation. During the first few weeks after birth, rat pups spend 
well over half the time in suckling behavior. In the nursing mother rat, the cortical ter-
ritory representing the ventral skin where her pups suckle increases many fold, only to 
retract when the pups are weaned (Figure 21.8).58 The significance of this experiment is 
the demonstration that map plasticity accompanies the variations in sensory experience 
that are part of the normal cycle of life.
Texture Sensation through the Whiskers: Peripheral Mechanisms
The map-like organization of somatosensory cortex is essential for detecting the location 
of a stimulus. We can think of somatotopic organization as the infrastructure necessary 
to maintain spatial information as signals ascend to cerebral cortex. However, there is 
much more to a stimulus than its location. The quality of touch sensation is related to 
which type of receptor has been activated and the details of the activity in the corre-
sponding neurons. This section provides examples of how touch sensations arise from 
neuronal activity. Of the many different sensations that originate in the skin, we have 
selected texture because it allows for interesting comparisons between the rat whisker 
and the primate fingertip sensory systems; some mechanisms are unique to each, and 
some mechanisms are common to both.
Texture is defined by local surface material and microgeometry. The perception of 
texture is important for animal behavior, for example in the selection of nesting materi-
als. Rats and mice sweep their whiskers forward and backward at a frequency of 5–15 Hz, 
describing large elegant arcs. The sweeping action is called “whisking” and an individual 
cycle is called a “whisk.” Whisking is an example of active sensing—that is, generation of 
receptor motion to create sensory signals. When the animals set out to identify the texture 
of an object, they approach it and then palpate its surface with brief, light whisks (Figure 
21.9A). To find out how well rats can identify textures, investigators have trained them 
in the dark to take one action upon contact with one texture and a different action upon 
contact with a second texture (e.g., turn to the left or right reward location according to 
the presented stimulus). The rats’ performance is remarkably fast and accurate. On an 
easy task, for instance when one texture is pebbly and the other perfectly smooth, they 
can extract texture identity from just one to three touches per whisker;59 this translates 
to a total time between initial contact and texture identification as short as 100–200 ms. 
If the task is made more difficult by using textures that are more alike, rats require more 
training and more contact time per trial. But after many practice sessions, they are able

to make discriminations that are difficult even for human subjects, for example selecting 
between a smooth surface and one with grooves that are 30 μm deep and spaced at 90 μm.60
The capacity to discriminate between textures begins with the signal transmitted by the 
whiskers. On any given whisk, many whiskers touch the surface, but they do so in a seemingly 
disorderly manner, passing in front of and behind their neighbors. This observation suggests 
that the sensory system does not utilize the specific spatial arrangement of the whiskers in 
the sensing of textures. Indeed, if only a few whiskers are left intact (the others clipped), 
rats can still discriminate textures. So, each whisker, by itself, appears to transmit a highly 
informative message. When moving in air, whisker motion is continuous and fluid. But 
along a surface, the whisker’s trajectory is characterized by an irregular, skipping motion 
made up of intermixed high and low velocities.61 The underlying process is known as stick 
and slip: the whisker tip tends to get fixed in place (i.e., sticks) and bends until the force 
behind it overcomes the resistance caused by friction; at this instant, the whisker springs 
loose (i.e., slips) only to get stuck again.62 The movement of whiskers on a surface contain-
ing grooves resembles their movement along irregular, coarse textures. For instance, Figure 
21.9B shows the trajectory of a single whisker as it is released from the groove of a plate. 
Discrimination can occur because each texture is associated with a distinct trajectory of 
sticks and slips, and the coarser the texture or the greater the spatial frequency of grooves, 
the greater is the probability of such slips and the greater their velocity when they occur.
Among sensory receptor neurons, spiking probability increases with progressively higher 
whisker speed and acceleration.63 Since whisking along coarse textures leads to higher-velocity 
slips than does whisking along smooth textures,61,62 rough texture is translated to a greater 
rate of neuronal firing.59,64 As we will see next, the animals’ judgment of roughness varies 
according to the firing rate in the sensory pathway.
Texture Sensation through the Whiskers: Cortical Mechanisms
The barrel cortex is critical for texture discrimination. After rats are trained to use their 
whiskers to discriminate between sandpapers with different grain sizes, the capacity is lost 
after a lesion of barrel cortex.65 Instead, the rats begin to use their forepaw to touch and 
identify textures.

FIGURE 21.9 Texture Discrimination Behavior. (A) This sketch depicts the rat as it leans across 
a gap to touch a textured plate with its whiskers. The cable on the head of the animal carries neuro-
nal signals to the computer. (B) One frame from a high-speed (1000 frames/second) video is shown. 
The orientation of the snout of the rat and the texture is similar to that in (A). This texture contains 
notch-like grooves. One whisker was tracked through a sequence of frames and the traces, from 
violet to light blue, shows the whisker position over 1 ms timesteps. The whisker tip was blocked in 
a groove and then sprung free as the rat whisked in the posterior direction. Irregular, fast events, like 
this one, provide information to the sensory receptors about texture. (A Drawn by Marco Gigante; B

In a direct test of the proposal that neuronal firing rate distinguishes between dif-
ferent texture sensations, activity was measured in cortical barrels while rats identified a 
contacted texture as rough or smooth, indicating their choice on each trial by moving to 
a water reward spout on either the left or right.59 Success rate was over 80%. On the set 
of trials when a rat correctly identified the stimulus, the average firing rate of neurons in 
barrel cortex was higher for rough trials than for smooth trials. The texture-specific firing 
rate appeared immediately preceding the instant of choice, consistent with the notion 
that this activity is the signal that leads the rat to identify the stimulus. On error trials, the 
firing-rate code was reversed (i.e., lower for rough than for smooth), meaning that the rat 
makes its decision (right or wrong) based upon the magnitude of whisker-evoked activity 
in barrel cortex. The temporal pattern of spikes might also contribute to the discrimination 
of texture,61,66 but this idea has proven hard to test in behaving animals.
Somatosensory System Organization and Texture 
Sensation in Primates
Magnification Factor
The whiskers are the critical touch organ in rats and mice, whereas in humans and other 
primates the fingertips are their equivalent. Each fingertip is innervated by axons from 
250–300 sensory neurons (about the same number as the whisker). Because individual 
axons branch out and terminate in multiple receptor structures, the density of mechano-
receptors reaches the remarkably high value of over 1000 per square cm. The large number 
of receptors is responsible for the fine tactual acuity of the fingertips, which enables Braille 
experts to read at speeds in excess of 100 words a minute or Venetian glass blowers to assess 
the smoothness of their vases.
The rich fingertip innervation density is, like the whisker innervation of rodents, con-
nected with an expanded cortical representation in which the representation of a 1 cm2
area of skin on the fingertip occupies a somatosensory cortical area 100 times greater than 
the representation of a 1 cm2 area of skin on the shoulder. In humans, innervation density 
and cortical magnification are high for the lips as well—crucial in the sensory aspects of 
eating, speaking, and kissing.
Topographic Map of the Skin and Columnar Organization
The magnification of certain areas of skin gives rise to the famous distorted cortical maps. 
In humans, it was discovered in the 1930s in patients undergoing brain operations. As the 
surgeon electrically stimulated a restricted cortical locus, the patient reported a sensation 
referred to a particular position on the body; touching that place on the skin led to an 
evoked potential at the same cortical site.67 The original scheme, the homunculus, was cor-
rect concerning the relative locations of the major parts of the body in the coronal plane. 
Later, details such as the fine organization of the face68 and the medial-to-lateral sequence 
of fingers69,70 were corrected by using fMRI. Like the cortical representation of the whiskers 
in the mouse and rat, the homunculus is a topographic map because neighboring sites on 
the skin are represented at neighboring sites in the cortex. Processing of painful stimuli also 
exhibits a topographic organization within the ascending sensory pathways.71
In the 1950s, the use of microelectrodes to record the responses of neuronal clusters 
to well-controlled stimuli in anesthetized animals led to two crucial advances beyond the 
basic cortical body map. First, columnar organization72 was discovered and described for 
the first time by Mountcastle and his colleagues in primate somatosensory cortex. When 
the electrode penetrated cortex at an angle normal to the surface, all neurons responded to 
the same receptor class and shared overlapping receptive fields on the skin (thus, barrels in 
mouse and rat somatosensory cortex are a special case of columnar organization). Second, 
map topography was worked out in much greater detail. Areas 3b and 1 (Figure 21.10) each 
contain a map arranged in an elongated medial-lateral strip along the postcentral gyrus 
(also see Appendix C); the two maps are arranged as mirror images reflected about the 
cytoarchitectonic border.73 Because a three-dimensional surface (the body) is projected 
onto a two-dimensional surface (the cortex), map discontinuities are inevitable.

Map Plasticity
Sensory discrimination capacities can improve with training. Is cortical map plasticity 
involved? In one study, monkeys were trained to discriminate the frequency of vibrations 
applied to one fingertip. Primary somatosensory cortex showed a clear change in the rep-
resentation of stimuli applied to the trained skin. The spatial representation expanded by 
a factor of 1.5–3, and the temporal precision of neuronal responses to vibrations improved 
as well.74,75 In humans, violin players have an enlarged representation of the fingertips of 
the left hand—the fingers that are used to manipulate the strings.76 Blind people who are 
expert Braille readers show heightened tactile acuity with the fingertip used to read the 
raised dots, accompanied by an expanded cortical representation of the same finger.77 To 
summarize, cortical topographic maps show a remarkable capacity throughout life to make 
fine adjustments in their representation of the external world. In general, selected parts of the 
sensory apparatus are allocated an expanded cortical representation when their behavioral 
significance is amplified by shifts in sensory demands or by training on specific tasks. The 
increased number of cortical cells processing the relevant stimuli may be associated with 
improved sensory capacities, though a causal relationship is hard to prove. 
Texture Sensation through the Fingertip: Peripheral Mechanisms
One important way in which fingertip touch differs from whisker touch is that we (primates) 
manipulate objects with our hands, whereas rodents do not manipulate objects with their 
whiskers. The fingertips provide tactile feedback necessary for the motor control of the hand, 
such as peeling a banana, holding a pencil, or buttoning a button. While we handle objects, 
texture is sensed quickly and provides essential information both for identifying the object and 
for generating the appropriate motor plan. For instance, texture is a large part of the sensation 
that tells us how tightly we must grasp an object to keep it from slipping through our hands.

The mechanisms for sensing texture through the primate fingertip differ in a number of 
ways from those of the whiskers. Receptors in the 35 whisker follicles form a discontinuous 
grid of 35 exquisitely sensitive points, whereas touch receptors in the fingertips are distrib-
uted in a continuous, overlapping sheet. The spatial relationships among the whiskers shift 
from one contact to the next, whereas the layout of fingertip touch receptors is constant 
over time. Several lines of evidence suggest that the perception of coarse textural features, 
through the fingertip, does rely on a spatial mechanism—at any given instant, the degree 
of roughness can be decoded by a “snapshot” (a spatial profile in a short time window) 
of the contrast in firing among slowly adapting neurons with nearby receptive fields. In 
contrast, the perceived roughness of finely textured surfaces is determined by the efficacy 
with which finger motion along the surface excites the rapidly adapting Pacinian system. 
We can view this latter process as a vibration mechanism, and it seems not to depend on 
comparing the distribution of excitation across separate receptors (a spatial mechanism). 
The reader will have noted that, of the two channels, the vibration mechanism has much 
in common with the prevailing view of how whiskers extract surface properties. This for-
mulation, with its distinct morphological and functional channels for smooth and rough, 
has been named the duplex theory of texture perception. Evidence for the duplex theory 
is given in the following sections.
COARSE TEXTURES The spatial distribution of receptors allows the primate sensory 
system to gather signals which turn out to be particularly important for sensing coarse 
textures. Textures of this sort—for which the center-to-center distance between raised 
elements is larger than about 200 microns—can be discriminated simply by pressing the 
finger against the surface.78 The fact that finger movement is not necessary points to slowly 
adapting receptors, presumably of the Merkel type, as the crucial peripheral termination; 
these receptors do not require motion across the receptive field but rather show an increased 
firing rate in proportion to the pressure applied to their tiny receptive field.2 More direct 
evidence for slowly adapting coding of coarse textures comes from physiological and psy-
chophysical experiments using stimuli formed by raised dots that vary in height, diameter, 
and center-to-center spacing.79,80 Human subjects rated the roughness of the stimuli, and 
their estimates were compared to the responses of monkey slowly adapting neurons for the 
same set of stimuli. The stimuli judged as roughest were the ones that evoked the greatest 
contrast in firing rate of nearby slowly adapting receptors. Why might contrast in firing 
among adjacent receptors be correlated with roughness? As illustrated in Figure 21.11, if 
the surface is rough or grainy, adjacent receptors absorb different forces. In contrast, if 
the surface is smooth, or if there is little space between adjacent grains, force is distributed 
equally across adjacent receptors.

the three light-colored spots. In (A), all three neurons are excited by surface features, so contact 
evokes little contrast in the firing rate among the three. In (B), two neurons are excited and one 
is not, causing a contrast in firing rate. In (C), there is also contrast in firing rate, but only one of 
three neurons is excited. Due to the contrast in firing rates, (B) would feel roughest. (After Connor 
and Johnson, 1992.)

The division of labor between rapidly and slowly adapting receptors in sensing rough 
texture is not absolute. There is evidence that rapidly adapting receptors of the Meissner 
type also contribute to the perception of coarse textures, but the mechanisms are not yet 
clear. In response to vibration, such receptors fire in phase with each displacement for 
frequencies up to about 50 Hz.11,81–83 Some subjects may use vibrations of this kind to 
identify texture as they move the fingertip along a surface.84,85
FINE TEXTURES Slowly adapting receptors only contribute if the separation between peb-
bles, dots, or ridges is more than about 200 microns; if spacing is less than 200 microns, each 
slowly adapting receptor averages over the different bumps within its receptive field, and the 
mechanism of firing contrast no longer works. Therefore, to sense the quality of a fine-grained 
texture, a finger must move along its surface. The mechanism depends on the firing rate of 
Pacinian receptors. This conclusion was derived from many different types of experiment.86
The first kind of experiment studied the effect of high-frequency adaptation on fine 
texture sensation. Pacinian receptors (see Chapter 19) register vibrations in the frequency 
range of 50–400 Hz with peak sensitivity for vibrations in the range of about 250–300 Hz.2
If sinusoidal vibrations centered on the Pacinian frequency band are continuously applied to 
a fingertip, high-frequency vibration sensitivity is lost, and such adaptation causes subjects 
to lose the ability to discriminate between fine textures but not between coarse textures. 
Adaptation of the Meissner rapidly adapting receptor with prolonged vibrations of 10 Hz 
does not affect the sensing of fine textures.
To collect more evidence, one experiment used a device to measure skin vibrations near 
the contact point between fingertip and the surface (Figure 21.12). On each trial, subjects 
were asked to compare the roughness of two surfaces. A higher degree of perceived roughness 
was associated with an increasing intensity of skin vibration within the range of maximum 
Pacinian sensitivity; vibrations at frequencies below or above the Pacinian peak sensitivity 
led to lower judgments of roughness.87 Remarkably, when subjects were presented the same 
texture twice, as if they were two separate stimuli, they judged the texture as rougher on 
the presentation that evoked stronger vibrations in the Pacinian range.86
As a final test, artificial vibrations were added. When the plate surface was made to 
vibrate in the preferred Pacinian frequency range while the subject was palpating it, the 
texture felt rougher, even when subjects were not aware of the vibration itself.88

Texture Sensation through the Fingertip: Cortical Mechanisms
The evidence described above concerns the coding of texture by the peripheral ner-
vous system. In the somatosensory cortex, the distinction between rapidly adapting 
and slowly adapting neurons is less sharp. In area 3b, the somatosensory cortical area 
with the strongest thalamic input, the responses of neurons are determined by three 
components within the receptive field: (1) a single, central region of a few millimeters 
diameter which, when touched, produces excitation at short latency, (2) surrounding 
regions which, when touched produce inhibition at nearly the same short latency as the 
central excitatory field, and (3) a region that overlaps both the short-latency excitatory 
and inhibitory regions and which, when touched, gives rise to inhibition but at a longer 
latency.89 Clearly, whenever object contact activates all three components, for example 
as the fingertip moves along a surface, the neuronal responses are hard to predict by 
simply summing the three receptive field components. Nevertheless, neurons have been 
found whose properties could support the representation of texture. First, neurons, 
whose receptive field properties would be expected to cause them to fire at higher rates 
for contact with coarser textures (Figure 21.13), have been identified; their output could 
give rise to the percept of roughness.89–91
Signals from Pacinian neurons also reach the somatosensory cortex, and some neurons 
are essentially tuned to give the greatest response to skin vibrations aligned with the peak of 
Pacinian sensitivity.4,82,92–99 Thus, vibrations like those illustrated in Figure 21.12B, which 
occur from movement across a fine surface, can be expected to excite cortical neurons.
It is certain that, in primates, the cerebral cortex does have a role in texture perception, 
and, as in rats, lesions in SI lead to severe impairments in roughness discrimination. In 
particular, ablation of Brodmann area 1 has a specific effect on texture discrimination.21,22
Yet the evidence both from cortical neurons that encode coarse pressure patterns and 
those that encode high-frequency vibrations has been obtained from monkeys receiving 
the stimuli passively—cortical activity has not yet been measured while monkeys identify 
surface roughness. Experiments involving explicit texture judgment will allow correlation 
of trial-to-trial neuronal output with percept, which is a necessary step to confirm all 
hypotheses about the neuronal representation of texture.

FIGURE 21.13 Scheme for Detection of Coarse Features: Cortical Mechanisms. As 
in Figure 21.11, red circles represent regular, raised features on the surface of an object (e.g., 
grains, dots, pegs). Center-to-center spacing of features is in (A) 1.5 mm, in (B) 3.0 mm, and in 
(C) 4.5 mm. The object surfaces are depicted in relation to the receptive field of a single, slowly 
adapting cortical neuron. Cortical neurons receive inputs from many peripheral receptors and 
have complex receptive fields, in this case an elongated excitatory central region (light area) 
flanked by alternating inhibitory (dark) and excitatory (light) subfields. The texture in (A) evokes a 
weak response in this neuron because the dots fall on both excitatory and inhibitory regions of 
the receptive field. The pattern in (B) produces strong excitation of the neuron because two of 
the dots fall on the central excitatory region and none on the flanking inhibitory subfield. The pat-
tern in (C) excites the neuron to a lesser extent because only one dot falls on the excitatory por-
tion. Thus, this cortical neuron would respond most strongly to a texture with a 3-mm spacing, 
which would be perceived as rough. (After Connor and Johnson, 1992.)

SUMMARY
 
■
Low-threshold mechanoreceptors form one class of 
skin receptor. There are several types, each defined 
by the specialized structure surrounding the nerve 
termination. The morphology of the structure makes 
the membrane sensitive to particular properties of 
mechanical stimuli. 
 
■
Another class of skin receptor is the free nerve ending, 
a terminal that is activated by strong mechanical, 
thermal, or chemical (painful) stimuli.
 
■
The method of microneurography—recording and 
stimulating single nerve fibers in the arm of human 
subjects—elucidates the connection between individual 
sensory receptor neurons and elemental sensations.
 
■
Different submodalities of skin sensation (light touch, 
painful touch, temperature) are relayed by separate 
anatomical routes to the contralateral thalamic nuclei. 
 
■
Primary somatosensory cortex (SI) is the main target of 
the somatosensory thalamic nuclei. Cortical neurons are 
excited by skin stimulation, and lesions cause profound 
tactile deficits (touch, shape, texture, etc.). 
 
■
The sense of pain and its emotional effect are 
influenced by social, cultural, and personal factors. 
These factors interact with the processing of painful 
stimuli by modulating the release of endorphins.
 
■
In rodents, the organization of the whisker sensory 
system introduces several fundamental principles 
shared with the primate touch system.
 
■
Individual whisker follicles lead, through a chain of 
synaptic relays, to individual cortical columns, called 
barrels. Barrels are arranged as a topographic map of 
the corresponding whiskers; the whisker map occupies 
a large territory of cerebral cortex.
 
■
Rats can distinguish between different textures through 
whisker contact. Contact with a surface causes an 
irregular whisker trajectory of stops and starts: the 
pattern of motion is distinctive for each texture.
 
■
In primates, the fingertips are crucial to many behaviors. 
They are densely innervated and are associated with a 
greatly expanded cortical representation.
 
■
The skin is represented by a mosaic of columns in 
somatosensory cortex. The columns are arranged to 
produce a distorted map of the skin (more columns for 
the fingertips and lips). The layout of cortical maps and 
the properties of single neurons within cortical maps are 
shaped by sensory experience.
 
■
In primates, there are two channels for sensing 
texture. The perception of coarse textures is based on 
the difference in firing rate between adjacent slowly 
adapting receptors. The perception of fine surfaces is 
based on vibrations in the skin, transduced by rapidly 
adapting Pacinian receptors.

■ CHAPTER 22
Auditory and Vestibular 
Sensation
T
he meaning of a sound is derived from analysis of its frequency components and its tem-
poral sequence. The frequency selectivity of auditory hair cells depends on their electri-
cal characteristics and on their position along the mechanically tuned basilar membrane. 
Therefore, the sensory epithelium is tonotopically arranged. In the mammalian cochlea, each 
sensory fiber of the eighth cranial nerve innervates a single inner hair cell and so responds best 
to the acoustic frequency that best activates that cell. Efferent feedback from the central nervous 
system reduces hair cell sensitivity and frequency selectivity in the inner ears of reptiles, birds, 
and mammals. Hair cells of certain vertebrates are electrically tuned to provide acoustic frequency 
selectivity. 
Afferent fibers from the cochlea form synapses within brainstem nuclei. Second-order neurons 
project to the superior olivary complex or into pathways that ascend through the inferior colliculus 
to the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. Neurons in primary auditory cortex receive input 
from both ears and encode features of sound that are more complex than those detected in the pe-
riphery. The localization of a sound arises from neural computations involving comparisons between 
inputs to the two ears. Accordingly, the central auditory pathway includes a complex set of synaptic 
relays and feedback connections at which binaural comparisons are made or other aspects of tim-
ing and frequency composition are determined. 
Position and motion of the head are sensed and transduced by the vestibular apparatus: three 
semicircular canals, the utricle, and saccule. Hair cells within each of these structures are activated 
by fluid flow induced by rotation or displacement of the head. Vestibular signals travel to the brain in 
sensory fibers of the eighth nerve but do not normally reach consciousness; they mediate automatic 
behaviors that maintain body posture and stability. An important mechanism for maintaining stability 
of gaze is the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). This reflex is mediated by a 3-neuron arc that includes 
sensory neurons, interneurons, and motoneurons. The VOR is capable of impressive plasticity 
through modulation by the cerebellum. 

454 Chapter 22
Mechanosensory hair cells of the inner ear respond to a wide range of mechanical stimuli, 
in terms of both intensity and frequency. Hair cells in the ear encode stimulus intensities 
that vary over six orders of magnitude. In addition, hair cells cover an equally impressive 
kinetic range, from vestibular coding of head movements that occur at 0.05 Hz to acoustic 
coding of sounds at more than 100 kHz (in whales and bats). And yet, at the molecular 
level, all vertebrate hair cells operate in essentially the same way—a deflection of their 
stereocilia causes a receptor potential and subsequent activation of postsynaptic neurons 
by release of glutamate (see Chapter 19). The specific range of stimulus frequencies and 
intensities to which particular hair cells respond is determined in large part by the acces-
sory structures in which they are imbedded. In this chapter we explore the structural ad-
aptations that confer stimulus specificity onto hair cell signaling and follow that signaling 
through higher levels of analysis. Our focus will be largely on the inner ear of mammals, 
but important lessons also have been learned by the study of other vertebrates, particularly 
at the level of cellular physiology. 
As seen in Figure 22.1, the labyrinth of the inner ear includes several elaborately 
shaped fluid-filled ducts. The tightly wound spiral of the cochlea (from the Greek kochlias, 
snail) lies ventral to 3 orthogonally positioned loops of the semicircular canals, part of 
the vestibular system. In addition, two relatively flat (macular) epithelia, the saccule and 
utricle, lie within the central vestibular chamber. A comparison of the labyrinth in reptiles, 
birds, and mammals provides an interesting correlation of structure and function. This 
point is made in drawings (Figure 22.1B,C) from von Bekesy,1 whose studies of inner ear 
function in the early twentieth century established the basis of cochlear frequency selec-
tivity. As seen in Figure 22.1, the disposition of semicircular canals is similar in reptiles, 
birds and mammals, implying that the function (detecting rotation of the head in space) 
is similar among vertebrates. In contrast, the spiraled cochlea of the mammal replaced 
the shorter, and still shorter auditory end organs of birds and reptiles. This evolutionary 
progression in auditory structure can be correlated with the frequency range of hearing,

circular canals and two macular epithelia, the utricle and saccule. These mechanisms provide 
essentially identical information in all vertebrates. In contrast, the auditory end organ (the cochlea 
in mammals) increases progressively in length from the 1-mm long basilar papilla of turtles, to 
the 5-mm long basilar papilla of chicken, to the 30-mm long cochlea of mammals. The length in-
crease serves as the substrate for expansion into higher frequency hearing, from 1 to 5 to 20 kHz.

up to 1 kHz in turtles, 5 kHz in chickens, and 30 kHz in rats. The longer, coiled cochlea 
of mammals provides a mechanism to expand the high frequency range of hearing. We 
shall see that a number of cellular specializations also contribute to the ability to hear 
higher frequencies. 
How is sound frequency encoded by cochlear hair cells, and how are these signals 
processed at higher levels of the auditory system? How is the spatial location of a sound 
determined? What are the neural computations that relate fluid movement of the inner 
ear to head position and movement? We begin by examining the structure and function 
of the sensory organs.
The Auditory System: Encoding the Frequency 
Composition of Sound
In terrestrial vertebrates, sound waves enter the outer ear, strike the tympanic membrane
(eardrum), and via mechanical coupling through the ossicles of the middle ear, are con-
verted to fluid waves in the mammalian cochlea (Figure 22.2A). The fluid waves, in turn,

Corti. This process has been summarized poetically by Aldous Huxley:

air in the great hall, had set the glass of the windows looking on to it vibrating; and 
this in turn had shaken the air in Lord Edward’s apartment on the further side. The 
shaking air rattled Lord Edward’s membrana tympani; the interlocked malleus, 
incus and stirrup bones were set in motion so as to agitate the membrane of the 
oval window and raise an infinitesimal storm of fluid in the labyrinth. The hairy 
endings of the auditory nerve shuddered like weeds in a rough sea; a vast number 
of obscure miracles were performed in the brain, and Lord Edward ecstatically 
whispered “Bach”!2
The Cochlea
The cochlear duct is divided into three compartments: The scala media contains a high-
potassium solution, the endolymph. It is separated from the overlying scala vestibuli by 
Reissner’s membrane and from the fluid space of the scala tympani by intercellular tight 
junctions between the apical ends of the hair cells and their surrounding supporting cells 
(Figure 22.2B). The scala tympani and scala vestibuli contain perilymph, similar in com-
position to cerebrospinal fluid; the ionic composition of endolymph in the scala media is 
like that of cytoplasm, with high potassium, low sodium, and calcium ions held to micro-
molar concentration.3 The unusual composition of this extracellular fluid is established 
by ion transport in the stria vascularis, a secretory epithelium that lines the lateral wall 
of the scala media.
There are two distinct groups of hair cells in the mammalian cochlea: inner hair cells (IHC) 
and outer hair cells (OHC). These reside in the organ of Corti on the basilar membrane (Figure 
22.2B,C). Their bundles of sensory hairs project up into an overlying acellular gelatinous sheet, 
the tectorial membrane. Inner and outer hair cells differ by position (inner hair cells are closer 
to the central axis of the cochlear coil) and innervation pattern. Inner hair cells receive more 
than 90% of the afferent contacts to the cochlea;4–6 while outer hair cells are the postsynaptic 
targets of the efferent nerve supply (see Figure 22.2C).7 This differential innervation pattern 
raises interesting questions concerning the functional roles of these two cell types that will 
be discussed later in this chapter. The tectorial membrane overlies the 
hair bundles of both inner and outer hair cells, and differential motion 
of the tectorial and basilar membranes causes lateral shear to gate the 
mechanotransduction channels (as detailed in Chapter 19).
Frequency Selectivity: Mechanical Tuning
Interpretation of auditory signals depends on the ability to analyze 
their frequency composition. In the mammalian cochlea, this analysis 
depends in part on the mechanical properties of the basilar membrane. 
Its width and thickness vary systematically along the cochlea (Figure 
22.3). At the base of the cochlea, near the oval window, the membrane 
is narrow and rigid, while at the cochlear apex, it is wide and flexible. 
The consequences of this progressive variation in structure were exam-

frequency. The curves represent relative displacement at the indicated fre-

near the wider (more flexible) apical membrane; higher frequencies produce 
maximal displacement near the narrower (stiffer) base. (B) Idealized tuning

intensity) are 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10,000 Hz. (A after von Bekesy, 1960;

ined by von Bekesy,1 who used stroboscopic illumination of reflective particles scattered 
on the basilar membrane to visualize the pattern of vibration. What he observed was that 
high-frequency sounds cause maximal vibration of the thicker, stiffer basal end of the 
membrane and that low-frequency sounds cause maximal vibration of the more flexible 
apical membrane. 
As a consequence of mechanical tuning of the basilar membrane, hair cells at the 
cochlear base (nearest the stapes footplate) are stimulated preferentially by high-frequency 
sound, whereas hair cells progressively further along the cochlear coil (nearer to the apex) 
respond best to progressively lower-frequency sound (Figure 22.3A). The resulting tonotopic 
map is reflected in the stimulus requirements of cochlear afferent neurons that selectively 
innervate single cochlear hair cells. The frequency selectivity of cochlear afferents can be 
determined by recording action potentials during systematic presentation of pure tones 
of various frequencies and intensities. The resulting tuning curve is V-shaped, with a best 
or characteristic frequency defined as the pure tone to which the fiber is most sensitive 
(Figure 22.3B). The characteristic frequency of each sensory fiber is determined by the 
position along the cochlear duct of the hair cell it contacts.
Electromotility of Mammalian Cochlear Hair Cells
The frequency-dependent vibration of cochlear membranes described by von Bekesy pro-
vided an elegant basis for cochlear tuning. However, when examined closely it was found 
that the physical properties of those membranes were not adequate to explain the great 
sensitivity and sharp tuning of individual cochlear afferent neurons. Furthermore, it was 
demonstrated that sharp tuning was physiologically vulnerable,8,9 suggesting that some 
energy-requiring biological process participated as well. The resolution lies in the fact that 
outer hair cells of the cochlea actively contribute to cochlear vibration through a process 
called electromotility. Outer hair cells shorten in response to depolarization and lengthen 
during hyperpolarization of their membranes, as though they were tiny muscles (Figure 
22.4).10,11 However, these movements are not generated by actin–myosin but result from 
direct effects of voltage on a charged motor protein, prestin, which is expressed at high levels 
in the basolateral membrane.12 It is thought that the voltage-dependent conformational 
changes undergone by prestin are somehow coupled to the cytoskeleton. Electromotility of 
outer hair cells adds to the vibration amplitude of the cochlear partition during stimulation 
by sound, and thus increases the deflection of the stereocilia of the inner hair cell.9 In this 
way, outer hair cells enhance cochlear tuning by adding mechanical energy to movement 
of the basilar membrane (Figure 22.5). Given this role as cochlear amplifiers, the puzzling 
efferent innervation pattern of the cochlea now makes more sense. The central nervous 
system can regulate cochlear sensitivity by adjusting the gain of the amplifier, that is, by 
altering outer hair cell motility.

FIGURE 22.4 Electromotility of Outer Hair Cells Whole-cell patch pipettes are used to clamp 
the membrane potential of outer hair cells isolated from the mammalian cochlea. Depolarization 
causes the cells to shorten; hyperpolarization makes them longer. Such length changes can be as 
large as 30 nm/mV.

Efferent Inhibition of the Cochlea
In mammals, neurons of the superior olivary complex in the brainstem project to ipsi-
lateral and contralateral cochleae (Figure 22.6A).13 Activation of this pathway causes the 
release of acetylcholine at efferent synapses onto hair cells and suppresses the response of 
cochlear afferent fibers to sound.14,15 An example of the reduction in sensitivity of cochlear 
afferents by efferent inhibition is shown in Figure 22.6B.16 Of interest is that suppression 
is maximal near the best frequency for the afferent, reinforcing the role of outer hair cells 
in cochlear frequency selectivity.
Efferent fibers respond to sound and innervate restricted portions of the cochlea; 
as a result, feedback inhibition is frequency specific.17,18 The effect is to reduce the

FIGURE 22.5 Motion of the Cochlear Partition
During sound-evoked fluid waves, the cochlear parti-
tion (basilar membrane and organ of Corti) moves up 
and down. (A) During the rarefaction phase of a sound 
wave, the basilar membrane and tectorial membrane 
move upward, resulting in a shearing motion toward 
the longest stereocilia of the hair bundle—depolarizing 
the hair cells relative to the resting condition (B). (C) 
Downward motion during the compressive phase of 
a sound produces the opposite displacement of the 
hair bundles, and hair cells are hyperpolarized relative 
to rest. (D) Active contraction of outer hair cells during 
depolarization accentuates the upward motion of the 
basilar membrane. (E) Hyperpolarization of outer hair 
cells causes them to elongate. The net effect is that 
motion of the basilar membrane is greater because of 
the so-called electromotility of the outer hair cells, and 
this is reflected in the activity pattern of afferent fibers 
contacting the inner hair cells. The extent of motion is 
greatly exaggerated here for the purpose of illustration.

cochlear response at the relevant frequency, which allows the cochlea to detect differ-
ences in intensity of loud sounds that would otherwise saturate the response. In other 
words, inhibition increases the dynamic range of perception at that frequency. Efferent 
feedback also plays a role in protecting the cochlea from loud sound damage.19 Indeed, 
the strength of efferent feedback is inversely correlated with the degree of acoustic 
injury from loud sound.20
All vertebrate hair cell organs are subject to efferent regulation, and intracellular record-
ings were first achieved in experimentally tractable preparations, such as the fish lateral 
line.21 Detailed studies in the turtle ear showed that activation of the efferent pathway 
caused large hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in hair cells22 that 
would be expected to suppress the hair cell’s response to sound. In fact, the inhibition of 
acoustic sensitivity was even more interesting, as shown by the intracellular recordings in 
Figure 22.7A. The hair cell was stimulated with pure tones at three frequencies: one that 
corresponded to the best or characteristic frequency, one at a higher frequency, and one 
at a lower frequency. The intensities of the tones were adjusted so that each evoked an 
oscillating receptor potential of the same amplitude. A short train of shocks to the effer-
ent axons hyperpolarized the cell and severely attenuated its response to a tone at 220 Hz 
(the characteristic frequency). At lower and higher frequencies of acoustic stimulation, 
activation of the efferents still resulted in hyperpolarization, but the voltage oscillations at 
high frequencies were unchanged, while those at low frequencies were actually enhanced 
in amplitude. This differential effect of inhibition results in broadening of the hair cell’s 
frequency response (Figure 22.7B), qualitatively similar to the detuning of cochlear af-
ferents in mammals (see Figure 22.6B). The basis for frequency tuning in the turtle ear is 
described in a later section.

frequency in sharply tuned fibers, so that frequency selectivity is reduced. (A,B after Warr, Guinan,

The ionic mechanism of cholinergic inhibition was established in chicken hair cells.23,24
The acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are ligand-gated cation channels through which sodium 
and calcium enter the cell, and this leads to the activation of calcium-dependent potassium 
channels. This two-channel mechanism produces a biphasic change in membrane potential, 
dominated by the much larger and longer-lasting hyperpolarization. A similar cholinergic 
inhibitory mechanism is found in mammalian hair cells.25–27 The hair cell’s response to ACh 
is antagonized by α-bungarotoxin, and there is good evidence that two unusual members 
of the nicotinic receptor family of genes, α9 and α10, form the hair cell AChR.28,29
This synaptic inhibition can explain how efferent synapses on outer hair cells suppress 
cochlear sensitivity measured as the response of inner hair cells and their associated affer-
ent neurons. Since outer hair cell electromotility is driven by rapidly alternating acoustic 
stimuli, the prolonged inhibitory hyperpolarization interrupts that motility. As a result, 
inhibition reduces the active mechanical contribution of outer hair cells to vibration of the 
cochlear partition,30 and so reduces excitation of inner hair cells. In this way the sensitivity 
and tuning of cochlear afferent neurons is reduced.17
It is interesting that electromotility is found only in outer hair cells of the mammalian 
cochlea. Both prestin (the hair cell motor protein) and α10 (a component of the hair cell 
AChR) have undergone purifying selection during evolution of the vertebrate ear, resulting 
in isoforms unique to the mammalian cochlea.31 Nonetheless, efferent inhibition in the 
turtle produces a similar loss of tuning,32 implying that some other voltage-dependent 
process enhances frequency selectivity in nonmammalian hair cells.

Frequency Selectivity in Nonmammalian 
Vertebrates: Electrical Tuning of Hair Cells
We have seen that the expanded frequency range of mammalian 
hearing is based on cellular and structural specializations that confer 
sharp and sensitive mechanical tuning to an extended cochlear duct. 
And yet, within their range of hearing, nonmammalian vertebrates 
achieve good acoustic frequency selectivity despite having much shorter 
basilar membranes that are not mechanically tuned, as in mammals.33
Crawford and Fettiplace undertook studies in the turtle that showed 
that the mechanosensory hair cells were frequency selective through 
a mechanism of intrinsic electrical tuning.34 Intracellular recordings 
from a hair cell in the turtle’s basilar papilla (the auditory sensory 
epithelium) are shown in Figure 22.8. When a brief acoustic stimulus 
(a click) was presented, the hair cell’s membrane potential underwent 
a damped oscillation or ringing that occurred at a frequency of about 
350 Hz (Figure 22.8A). This frequency is the same as that of pure tones 
to which the hair cell was most sensitive, as shown by the frequency 
sweep experiment in Figure 22.8C. Here, a constant intensity tone was 
presented to the external ear, and its frequency was gradually swept from 
20–1000 Hz. The voltage response in the hair cell peaked near 350 Hz. 
The voltage ringing produced by an acoustic transient and the tuning 
curve produced by frequency sweeps are equivalent demonstrations 
of the hair cell’s frequency selectivity. 
Figure 22.8B shows the important result that occurs when a micro-
electrode was used to inject a rectangular current pulse (an electrical 
transient) into the cell. Voltage ringing was produced with frequency 
and rate of decay that were identical to those caused by an acoustic transient. The conclusion 
from these experiments is that the hair cell’s frequency selectivity depends on the electrical 
properties of the plasma membrane. Electrical and acoustic tuning frequencies of hair cells are 
equivalent and vary systematically along the length of the turtle’s basilar papilla, producing a 
tonotopic array of tuned detectors. 
Hair Cell Potassium Channels and Electrical Tuning
What properties of the cell membrane provide this electrical tuning, and how do these 
properties vary to determine different tuning frequencies? Recordings from hair cells in 
the frog’s saccule revealed that interactions between voltage-gated calcium channels and 
calcium-sensitive (or Ca2+-gated), voltage-gated potassium (BK) channels can produce 
voltage ringing.35,36 Studies of hair cells isolated from the turtle ear37,38 demonstrated 
that the characteristic frequency of each cell is determined in a remarkably elegant and 
straightforward way—namely, by the density and kinetic properties of the BK potassium 
channels in each cell (Figure 22.9).

350 Hz, with an initial peak-to-peak amplitude of about 8 mV. (B) A hyper-
polarizing current pulse (upper trace) applied to the same cell produces

in A and B, is stimulated with pure tones ranging from 25–1000 Hz, the

at about 350 Hz. (D) Excised turtle inner ear stained with methlyene blue.

462 Chapter 22
In hair cells tuned to lower frequencies, the total potassium conductance is smaller 
and slower to activate, and thus gives rise to relatively slow voltage oscillations. In higher-
frequency cells, the potassium conductance is larger and more rapidly activating. These 
distinctions extend to the single channel level (Figure 22.10), where it can be shown that 
slow BK currents are produced by channels with longer mean open times. Channels with 
shorter mean open times carry faster currents. Single channel conductance is the same, 
so that high- and low-frequency cells also must express different numbers of channels.

The BK channels in hair cells of frogs,39 turtles,40 and chickens41,42 are encoded by a gene 
whose mRNA is subject to alternative splicing of its composite exons. Some differentially 
spliced isoforms of the channel are kinetically distinct.43 Additional variability may be 
provided by an accessory β-subunit that combines with the channel and slows its gating 
kinetics.44 Although BK channels also are expressed in the mammalian cochlea, there is 
little alternative splicing,45 and no evidence for electrical resonance in inner or outer hair 
cells. Nonetheless, as in birds,46 BK channels appear in rodent cochlear hair cells near the 
onset of hearing47 and are more numerous in higher-frequency hair cells.48,49 The expres-
sion of mRNA significantly precedes that of functional channels, and developmental and 
tonotopic expression patterns appear to be regulated at the level of membrane localization 
of protein.50,51
The Auditory Pathway: Transmission between 
Hair Cells and Eighth Nerve Fibers
Depolarizing and hyperpolarizing receptor potentials alter the open probability of voltage-
gated calcium channels in the hair cell’s basolateral membrane. Calcium entry in turn alters 
the rate of release of neurotransmitter (glutamate) onto the terminal of a postsynaptic 
afferent neuron. Hair cells, like retinal photoreceptors and bipolar cells, employ so-called 
ribbon synapses for tonic transmitter release52 (Figure 22.11; see also Chapters 13 and 
20). Even in the absence of a stimulus, the membrane potential of the hair cell is positive 
to the threshold for gating of voltage-activated calcium channels; consequently, release 
of glutamate is ongoing and excites the afferent fibers, giving rise to spontaneous action 
potentials. At frequencies below ~5 kHz, the sinusoidal receptor potential in cochlear hair 
cells alternately increases and decreases the rate of transmitter release, producing phase-
locking in the postsynaptic firing pattern. At frequencies greater than 5 kHz, the hair cell’s 
membrane time constant prevents rapid changes in membrane potential and the resulting 
afferent activity simply increases above the spontaneous rate for the duration of the tone, 
without cycle-by-cycle phase locking. 
A type I afferent neuron in the mammalian cochlea has a single dendrite that is post-
synaptic to a single ribbon in a single inner hair cell.53 Afferent action potential activity 
often exceeds 100 Hz, requiring that the ribbon synapse have an impressive capacity to 
marshal and release vesicles.54–56 Given that each inner hair cell ribbon tethers only 100–200 
vesicles,57 it is still mysterious how this occurs. A further surprise is that spontaneous

transmitter release from ribbon synapses appears to be multivesicular; that is, it can be 
composed of several vesicles released simultaneously.58 It is likely that ribbon function may 
involve unique proteins differing from those serving release at other chemical synapses.59,60
Stimulus Coding by Primary Afferent Neurons
Neuronal signaling in the auditory pathway begins with the spiral ganglion neurons that 
receive transmitter released from hair cells and send their central axons to the cochlear 
nucleus of the brainstem. Many decades of single fiber recordings have catalogued the 
acoustic responses of these primary afferents.61 Each spiral ganglion neuron responds selec-
tively to the frequency of sound that is optimal for the inner hair cell to which it is attached. 
Each inner hair cell is the sole presynaptic partner of a group of type I afferent neurons, 
numbering from 10 to 30, depending on location in the cochlea (see Figure 22.11). Both 
acoustic threshold and spontaneous firing rate vary among this pool of afferents53 helping 
to extend the dynamic range of the cochlea. Presumably, individual ribbon synapses of an 
inner hair cell can have different release properties.62,63 The selective innervation of inner 
hair cells on the mechanically tuned basilar membrane produces an array of 10,000 or so 
afferent neurons that serve as frequency-labeled lines—the first stage of the tonotopically 
organized auditory pathway. In addition to this pitch-is-place mechanism, phase-locked 
firing of afferent action potentials to acoustic sinusoids can be used to encode frequency 
up to about 3 kHz in the guinea pig64 and up to 10 kHz in the barn owl.65
Brainstem and Thalamus
The main auditory pathways are illustrated schematically in Figure 22.12. 
Auditory fibers of the eighth nerve travel centrally and send branches 
to both the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei.66 Second-order axons 
ascend in the contralateral lateral lemniscus to innervate cells in the 
inferior colliculus (the nucleus of the lateral lemniscus is a synaptic 
way station for some of these fibers). Neurons in the ventral cochlear 
nucleus also provide collateral branches to both the ipsilateral and 
contralateral superior olivary nuclei. Third-order cells in the olivary 
nuclei, in turn, send ascending fibers to the inferior colliculus. The 
ascending pathway continues through the medial geniculate nucleus 
of the thalamus to the auditory region on the transverse surface of the 
temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex. 
Each level in the auditory pathway is tonotopically mapped. However, 
as one ascends higher in the auditory system, individual cells have more 
complex response properties than the simple V-shaped tuning curves 
of cochlear afferent neurons. For example, some cells in the inferior 
colliculus67 and auditory cortex68 are only excited near threshold at 
their characteristic frequency, and louder tones are inhibitory. 
Sound Localization
The impressive sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the auditory 
system may have evolved to improve the animal’s ability to locate a 
sound in space. The advantages of doing so are obvious; long-range 
signals emitted as sound waves can reveal a distant predator or prey in

liculus; those from the ventral cochlear nucleus also supply collaterals bilaterally to the

liculus. Neurons of the inferior colliculus project to the medial geniculate nucleus of the 
thalamus, which in turn projects to the auditory cortex. (After Berne and Levy, 1988.)

the absence of visual or other cues. However, in contrast to the visual or somatosensory 
systems, the auditory neuroepithelium cannot code location directly. Instead, sound loca-
tion is computed from binaural comparisons of timing and intensity that occur within the 
central auditory system. The auditory pathway, therefore, is correspondingly complex and 
involves numerous subcortical synaptic relays and extensive crossing over at nearly every level.
The dorsal cochlear nucleus is used largely for monaural frequency analysis69 and 
provides a relatively direct, tonotopically organized projection onto the contralateral 
primary auditory cortex, or A1, via the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate nucleus 
of the thalamus. In contrast, second-order neurons in the ventral cochlear nucleus project 
both ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the superior olivary complex in the brainstem. Most 
neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO) are excited by stimulation of either ear70 (and 
so are designated EE neurons) but respond best when a tone is presented to the two ears 
with a characteristic delay, corresponding to arrival first at one ear, then the other. The 
velocity of sound in air is 340 m/s, so the maximal time difference imparted by the human 
head (about 18 cm in diameter) is 0.5 ms for a sound arriving along the axis of the two 
ears, and successively more frontal locations impart smaller time differences. In addition 
to differences in arrival time, continuous sound sources give rise to phase differences at 
the two ears.71,72
Cells in the lateral superior olive receive excitation from the ipsilateral ventral cochlear 
nucleus (Figure 22.13). Cells in the contralateral ventral cochlear nucleus project across the 
midline to form synapses in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). The cells 
of the MNTB inhibit neurons in the lateral superior olive.73 Thus, neurons in the lateral 
superior olive are excited by ipsilateral but inhibited by contralateral sound and so are 
designated EI neurons. Such an interaction would be useful for detecting differences in the 
intensity of sound at the two ears. As much as a 10-fold difference in intensity is found at 
high frequencies, for which the head serves as an effective sound shadow.74
Psychophysical studies have shown that localization is accomplished by combining dif-
ferences between the two ears in time of arrival and/or intensity of the incoming sound.75,76
Thus, if clicks are presented through earphones with different delays, the sound is localized 
toward the ear in which the click arrives first. Humans can detect interaural time differ-
ences of as little as 5 μs—remarkable resolution considering that action potentials are 
approximately 1 ms in duration, which once again emphasizes the importance of precise 
timing for auditory function. If the clicks are made simultaneously but are of different 
intensities, localization occurs to the side with the loudest click. Both phase and intensity 
differences vary as a function of frequency. For the human head, phase differences between 
the two ears are more significant below 2 kHz, whereas intensity differences become more 
prominent at higher frequencies.

chlear nucleus project to the ipsilateral LSO (lateral superior olive) as well as to the contralateral 
(MNTB) medial nucleus of the trapezoid body and the contralateral MSO (medial superior olive). 
Thus, MSO neurons are excited by both ears, and LSO neurons are excited ipsilaterally but are 
inhibited contralaterally by way of the intervening inhibitory interneuron in the MNTB.

466 Chapter 22
The ability to localize the vertical position of a sound depends heavily on its frequency 
composition.77 The external ear and head are not in mirror symmetry above and below. As 
a consequence, frequency components are differentially reflected depending on whether 
a sound rises or falls toward the listener.78 
Auditory Cortex
Auditory input processed through both dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei ascends to the 
auditory cortex. The primary auditory cortex (A1) is located on the superior bank of the 
temporal lobe, corresponding to Brodmann’s areas 41 and 42 (see Appendix C) (Figure 
22.14). In cats, A1 is exposed on the lateral surface of the brain; many combined anatomi-
cal–physiological studies have been performed in this species.79 Microelectrode recordings 
in anesthetized animals have shown that A1 has a columnar organization, with cells along 
a vertical track all having the same best frequency.80,81 The auditory periphery (organ of 
Corti) is essentially a one-dimensional map of frequency, so auditory cortex is laid out in 
isofrequency slab-like formation, along which other acoustic dimensions can be mapped.82
The auditory cortex in monkeys contains multiple cochleotopic maps, with parallel 
projections from the medial geniculate nucleus to all these areas.83 The most posterior of the 
three areas corresponds to A1.84 Surrounding this central core are secondary auditory areas 
that interconnect with primary cortex but also with subdivisions of the medial geniculate 
nucleus. Thus, pathways exist for both serial and parallel processing in the auditory cortex.85
By analogy to other sensory cortices, one would expect the tonotopic map of A1 to be 
subdivided into different functional zones. What acoustic features will be mapped onto 
cortex? Neurons within an isofrequency slab are clustered according to whether inputs 
from the two ears summate or suppress.86 This clustering is thought to reflect binaural 
computations of sound location carried out in olivary nuclei, although there is no contiguous 
cortical map of auditory space.82 And, while evidence also exists for systematic variations 
in intensity and bandwidth coding in A1,87–89 their functional significance remains obscure. 
Environmental sounds, including vocalizations, consist of constant frequency elements, 
frequency-modulated elements, and noise bursts.90 That is, recognition of acoustic objects 
must depend on analysis not just of frequency composition but also of how that composi-
tion changes in time and the relative timing between different acoustic elements. There 
is growing appreciation that many cortical neurons are particularly sensitive to the time-
varying components of species-specific vocalizations or calls.91 Over 20 years ago, Suga and 
colleagues established this principle in studies of echo-locating bats,92 and more recently, 
it has been examined in other species.93,94 Human vocalizations (i.e., speech sounds) are 
determined largely by the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract, called formants. Vowels 
are identified by the relative frequencies of the first two formants. Consonants depend 
more heavily on rapid temporal transitions.91

Understanding cortical representation of these complex acoustic objects requires more 
comprehensive analytical methods, such as reverse correlation. In this approach the response of 
a single cortical neuron is used to examine the features of a broadband, randomly modulated 
stimulus leading up to that response. A neuron’s selectivity for some combination of spectro-
temporal features (called the spectrotemporal response function, or STRF) is defined by its 
preferred rate (i.e., modulation in time), and scale (i.e., breadth of frequency selectivity). Using 
these parameters, a hypothetical neuron selective for a vowel sound would have a high scale 
(narrow spectral bandwidth) and low rate (little temporal modulation). A neuron encoding 
consonants would have low scale (broad bandwidth) and high rate (rapid transients).95
The processing of auditory signals is complex.96,97 Behaviorally important sounds 
must be extracted from a rich and variable acoustic environment.98 Not only the frequency 
content but also the sequence in time of incoming sounds must be analyzed in some 
way99 (e.g., playing a tape recording of human speech backward produces gibberish). In 
humans, the basic elements of speech, called phonemes, are common to all languages 
and are the sounds first babbled by babies, before particular sounds are selected to be 
combined into words.100 These basic sounds are composed of the formants and temporal 
transitions previously described. One evident challenge for auditory perception is to 
identify a particular temporal pattern of frequency changes as an acoustic object, even 
as the absolute frequencies vary with different speakers (male versus female voices, for 
example). By analogy with the visual system, which contains cells that respond to slits, 
corners, edges, and other geometrical forms (see Chapter 3), we might expect to find 
higher-order cells in the human auditory cortex that respond to particular formants or, 
perhaps, phonemes. However, in contrast to the other senses, auditory information is 
extensively processed at subcortical levels, as suggested by its more complex subcortical 
circuitry. For example, neurons of the inferior colliculus signal interaural time disparities 
equivalent to those of behavioral threshold.101 
There is an emerging realization that primary auditory cortex may encode relatively 
complex auditory features, or even complete auditory percepts,102 rather than performing the 
hierarchical assembly of features as in other primary sensory cortices. This organizational plan 
may reflect the greater challenge of encoding stimuli whose sense is not primarily spatial, as 
it is for vision and touch. It remains to be seen whether auditory cortex analyzes component 
features of acoustic stimuli, or more complex assemblies of features that might be regarded 
as auditory objects.96
The Vestibular System: Encoding Head Motion 
and Position
The inner ear contains the machinery for detecting movement of the head. Three semicircular 
canals, one horizontal and two vertical, are designed to detect angular motion of the head 
(rotation), while the macular epithelia, saccule, and utricle (surmounted by otolithic crystals) 
all signal linear acceleration (see Figure 22.1). The arrangement of three orthogonally disposed 
vestibular canals is conserved throughout all vertebrates (with the exception of jawless fishes, 
such as the lamprey with only two canals and a single otolithic macula).103 Even invertebrate 
cephalopod molluscs (e.g., squid, octopi) have vestibular-like organs, called statocysts.104
Vestibular information is essential to maintenance of posture, efficient locomotion, and 
stability of gaze. Sometimes referred to as “the silent sense,” vestibular function remains 
largely subconscious, at least, until something goes wrong. Motion sickness is one temporary 
but common experience of inappropriate vestibular input, while more serious, longer-
lasting deficits can significantly degrade the quality of life. One easily appreciated example 
arises from consideration of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) that enables one’s gaze to 
remain fixed on a target as the head moves. Without this reflex, activities such as driving 
a car become impossible, since gaze fixation is required to read signs, avoid obstacles, etc., 
while the car, and hence the head, is in motion.105
Vestibular Hair Cells and Neurons
As in the cochlea, the central chamber of the vestibular labyrinth is filled with potassium-
rich endolymph. The stereociliary bundles of sensory hair cells project into this space.

Consequently, potassium ions enter through open transducer channels to depolarize the 
hair cell. In contrast to the cochlea, the vestibular labyrinth has only a small negative en-
dolymphatic potential.106 Hair cell receptor potentials are additionally shaped by a variety 
of voltage-gated potassium channels whose distribution varies by cell type.107 As in the 
cochlea, resting tension within the hair bundle keeps a small fraction of transducer chan-
nels open at rest—that is, in the absence of explicit stimulation. Thus, head movements 
that deflect vestibular hair bundles toward the tallest stereocilia depolarize by opening 
additional transducer channels, while oppositely oriented deflections hyperpolarize by 
closing those transducer channels that are open at rest. 
Responses of vestibular hair cells to movements are determined largely by their location 
and orientation within the vestibular apparatus. Neither a high-resolution micrograph of 
a vestibular hair cell nor an intracellular electrical recording would identify a particular 
cell as being one from the cristae of the semicircular canals or from the maculae of the 
utricle and saccule.108 Rather, hair cell structure and function vary topographically in each 
end organ.109 The hair cells are of two types (Figure 22.15). Type I vestibular hair cells 
are amphora-shaped and enclosed by a specialized afferent nerve terminal, the calyx. The 
hair cells release glutamate onto the calyx from ribbon type synapses. Type II hair cells are 
columnar in shape, have ribbon synapses in apposition to bouton-like endings of afferent 
neurons, and once again, employ glutamate as a neurotransmitter. 
Afferent fibers contact multiple hair cells and are distinguished by the types of synaptic 
endings they make: calyx-only, bouton-only, and dimorphic (i.e., calyx and bouton).110
In addition, electrical recordings from vestibular afferents show that they can be divided 
into regular and irregular subtypes on the basis of their firing patterns.111 Irregularly firing 
afferents tend to have larger diameter axons with calyx or dimorphic endings, and their

FIGURE 22.15 Vestibular Hair Cells and Neurons. Two types of hair cell are found in all 
vestibular epithelia. Type I is amphora-shaped and entirely engulfed by the highly specialized 
calyx afferent ending. Type II hair cells are more “typical,” as they are columnar and contacted by 
bouton-type afferent endings. Vestibular afferent neurons also can be classified by morphology. 
Calyx-only afferents have the largest diameter axons, only make calyx endings, and tend to be 
found near the center of each sensory epithelium. Bouton-only afferents have smaller diameter 
axons and tend to be found in the periphery of the epithelium. Dimorphic afferents make both 
calyx and bouton endings and are scattered throughout the epithelium. Efferent neurons also in-
nervate vestibular epithelia and make contacts directly onto type II hair cells, and onto the calyx 
ending surrounding type I hair cells. Efferent activation can result in either excitation or inhibition of 
vestibular afferent activity.

responses to head movement are more transient, or phasic.112 Vestibular afferent fibers can 
have high spontaneous firing rates, so that head movements are encoded by both increasing 
and decreasing firing rate.
Cholinergic efferent innervation is directed to the calyces on type I hair cells and directly 
onto type II hair cells. Depending upon the species and end organ under study, efferent 
feedback can be inhibitory, excitatory, or both.113
The Adequate Stimulus for the Saccule and Utricle
The macular epithelia, saccule and utricle, are commonly referred to as otolithic organs 
because each is overlaid by a mass of calcium carbonate crystals encased in a gelatinous 
matrix (Figure 22.16). These otoliths (or ear stones) reside in the endolymphatic space in 
contact with hair cell stereocilia. Head motion results in stereociliary deflection because 
the inertial load of the otoliths delays their motion relative to that of the head. Because 
the utricle lies approximately in the horizontal plane when the head is upright, it signals 
horizontal motion. The saccule hangs nearly vertically in the upright head, so it responds 
maximally to vertical motion. In each instance the effective stimulus is linear acceleration. 
Constant linear velocity is not a stimulus (as we experience during vehicular travel). Hair 
cell orientations vary systematically within each macular epithelium (see Figure 22.16). 
In the utricle, the tall edge of each hair bundle (and the position of the kinocilium) points 
toward a central line of reversal. In the saccule hair, bundles point away. Thus, analysis of 
linear acceleration must involve integration of both negative and positive changes in af-
ferent activity from each end organ as well the combination of inputs from both saccule 
and utricle from both sides of the head.

enlargement called the ampulla, within which is housed the sensory epithelium, called 
the crista. The long stereocilia of the hair cells are all oriented in the same direction and 
insert into a large gelatinous sail-shaped structure, called the cupula. (C) The utricle and 
saccule are almost flat epithelia, in which hair bundle orientation is either toward (utricle) 
or away from (saccule) a central line of reversal, the striola.

470 Chapter 22
The Adequate Stimulus for the Semicircular Canals
The crista ampullaris, which is the sensory epithelium within the enlarged ampulla of each 
semicircular canal, is comprised of hair cells and supporting cells. As the head rotates, in-
ertial drag causes movement of fluid within the semicircular canal and thus displacement 
of the cupular membrane that stretches across the ampulla (Figure 22.17). The elongated 
stereociliary bundles of the hair cells project up into the acellular cupula and so are deflected 
by this motion. If head rotation is constant, the fluid eventually catches up and cupular 
deflection ceases. Thus, the fluid mechanics of semicircular canals impart a particular sen-
sibility; their hair cells and afferent neurons signal only the change in rotational velocity or 
angular acceleration (although this principal mechanism is supplemented by cellular and 
synaptic processes).114 The orientation of hair bundles is unidirectional within each crista, 
with the result that fluid motion toward the central vestibular chamber is excitatory for the 
horizontal canals, and inhibitory (i.e., reducing spontaneous firing) for the vertical canals.

FIGURE 22.17 Stimulation of Vestibular Epithelia (A–C) Fluid motion within each semicircular 
canal deflects the cupula and the inserted stereocilia, causing receptor potentials in the hair cells. 
Horizontal canals in the two ears provide opposite signals for rotation on the horizontal plane. The 
right anterior and left posterior canals as well as the left anterior–right posterior canals provide 
opposing signals about those planes of rotation, approximately 45° from head vertical (see Figure 
21.1). (D) The hair bundles of macular hair cells project into an overlying gelatinous mass contain-
ing calcium carbonate crystals (i.e., the otoliths or ear stones). The otolith provides an inertial 
load, so that linear acceleration of the head results in differential motion of the epithelium and the 
overlying otolith, and thus, causes receptor potentials in hair cells of each macula. The utricle lies 
approximately in the horizontal plane of the upright head and the saccule approximately vertically 
to it, making each relatively sensitive to motion in those planes. The arrows show the direction 
of utricular hair bundle deflection for horizontal acceleration and deceleration. However, all head 
motion produces components of motion that affect both maculae. Further, the oppositely oriented 
hair bundles in each macula give still greater differentiation to the peripheral signal.

The Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex 
The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) depends on a simple (3-neuron) 
circuit by which head motion elicits equal and opposite motion of the 
eyeballs so that the fovea can remain fixated on an object of interest in 
visual space.115 We will describe one particular example, horizontal head 
rotation, but in fact, all directions of movement activating both cristae 
and macular epithelia participate in foveation by this mechanism.116 
A rotation of the upright head to the left is compensated by an equal 
rightward rotation of the eyes (Figure 22.18). Leftward head rotation 
is excitatory to the left semicircular canal and suppresses activity in the 
right canal. Left-side canal afferents excite second-order neurons in the 
vestibular nucleus of the brainstem, which excite motor neurons in the 
oculomotor nucleus that in turn activate the medial rectus muscle of the 
left eye, causing it to rotate rightward. Second-order vestibular neurons 
also excite motor neurons (in the abducens nucleus) to the lateral rectus 
muscle of the right eye, causing it to rotate rightward an equal amount. 
Thus leftward head rotation is accompanied by coordinate, conjugate, 
and opposing motions that keep the two eyes fixated on the original 
visual target. Reduced activity in the right horizontal semicircular pro-
duces complementary reduction of activity and relaxation of opposing 
muscles: left lateral rectus and the right medial rectus.
Under normal conditions the gain of this reflex is one, and it can 
operate near normally even with input from only one ear. Obviously, 
complete loss of the vestibulo-ocular reflex can severely limit normal 
life activities. Somewhat less devastating is a condition called superior 
semicircular canal dehiscence, a thinning or complete loss of bone 
in the floor of the cranial vault at the top of the arch of the posterior 
(superior) semicircular canal.117 Such a bony defect allows for trans-
mission of mechanical energy from the cranial fluids to those of the 
superior semicircular canal, thereby exciting reflex eye movements in 
the plane of the canal. One disturbing consequence is that loud sounds 
or impacts absorbed through the head can give rise to eye movements 
and vertigo. For example, the action and sound of water from a shower 
results in the shower stall appearing to move! Fortunately, the defect 
can be repaired surgically.
Higher Order Vestibular Function
As mentioned, vestibular function is largely subconscious, driving or modulating motor 
activity but not usually giving rise to conscious sensation. This state can change however, 
with vertigo and nausea arising from unusual vestibular input (motion sickness), or dys-
function. Happily, in most circumstances one can adapt to that altered condition, gaining 
sea legs, as it were.
Adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) has been studied extensively. The VOR 
is highly plastic, and adapts readily to altered sensory input, as wearers of bifocal glasses 
can attest. In fact, experimental manipulation of the VOR often involves magnifying or 
reducing lenses that alter the eye’s focal length and thus the rate at which the visual scene 
shifts during eye movement. Subsequently, the VOR gain (i.e., the ratio of head to eye 
movement) changes or adapts with experience so that the appropriate compensation is 
made. This plasticity results from cerebellar modulation of the reflex.118,119 Purkinje cells 
in the vestibular portion of the cerebellar cortex (flocculus and nodulus) project directly 
to inhibit principal neurons of the vestibular nuclei. Changes in synaptic efficacy may take 
place in the cerebellar Purkinje cells or in their target neurons in the vestibular nuclei.120,121
As predicted, cerebellar lesions prevent VOR adaptation.122
How does vestibular sensation reach consciousness? The answer is confounded by the 
complication that vestibular sensation usually includes visual, proprioceptive, and tactile 
stimulation.123 Further, there is little evidence for a specific vestibular neocortex. Rather,

tivity causes excitation of principal cells of the vestibular nucleus 
in the brainstem, which in turn excites motorneurons of the 
ipsilateral medial rectus and contralateral lateral rectus, causing 
rightward rotation of the eyes. The net effect is to maintain gaze 
on a point in space, even as the head is deflected.

vestibular information reaches many cortical association areas, combining with visual, 
somatosensory, and motor signals.124 This fact by no means diminishes the importance of 
the so-called silent sense. In addition to being essential for effective locomotion and visual 
analysis, vestibular input plays a role in autonomic reflexes, helping maintain blood pres-
sure and respiration with postural changes.125 It has been proposed that the nausea arising 
from vertigo might serve to condition avoidance of potentially dangerous situations.126

SUMMARY
 
■
Sound waves are converted into electrical signals by 
hair cells in the basilar membrane of the cochlea. These 
signals are passed on to the central nervous system 
through synapses on terminals of auditory nerve fibers.
 
■
In mammals, the basilar membrane is tuned 
mechanically so that it responds to high frequencies at 
the basal end and low frequencies at the apical end. 
The mechanical response of the cochlear membrane is 
enhanced by voltage driven motility of outer hair cells.
 
■
Outer hair cells of the cochlea are subject to efferent 
inhibition by cholinergic brainstem neurons. Efferent 
inhibition reduces the sensitivity and broadens the 
frequency response of cochlear afferent fibers.
 
■
In lower vertebrates, frequency selectivity is imparted 
to hair cells by electrical tuning. Voltage-gated calcium 
channels and calcium-activated potassium channels 
interact to enhance the voltage response at a frequency 
that corresponds to the characteristic acoustic 
frequency for each hair cell.
 
■
The central auditory pathway, including cortex, is 
tonotopically mapped. Response properties of cells 
in auditory cortex are complex, showing binaural 
interactions and dependence on temporal combinations 
of tones. Binaural comparisons of sound intensity and 
timing are used to compute the locations of sounds in 
space. These computations are made with synaptic 
connections in nuclei of the superior olive.
 
■
Stimulus specificity for vestibular hair cells is conferred 
by the mechanics of their surrounding tissues. 
Semicircular canals detect angular acceleration, while 
the macular organs, saccule, and utricle detect linear 
acceleration.

■ CHAPTER 23
Constructing Perception
          ll the data that sensory receptors collect from the outside world are present in the periph-
          eral sensory system, but neuronal activity does not lead to conscious experience until it 
              can be further elaborated in the cerebral cortex. There, ongoing streams of sensory sig-
nals are transformed from representations of basic elements into more complex combinations of 
features; current experiences become meaningful once compared, within cortex, to recent and 
distant memories as well as to expectations. The knowledge gained from the external world is also 
used to prepare the appropriate motor output. How this occurs is the subject of this chapter. The 
cerebral cortex is one of the most studied parts of the nervous system and so our aim here is nei-
ther to survey every line of research nor to supply conclusions in an encyclopedic manner. Instead, 
we consider in detail two forms of processing: the first is perception of vibration applied to the 
skin, the second is recognition of an object in the visual field.
Monkeys can be trained to compare the frequencies, f1 and f2, of a base and a comparison 
tactile vibration, separated in time by a delay of one or more seconds. They must produce differ-
ent motor responses according to whether the first or the second frequency is higher: f1 >  f2 or  f2 
> f1. Their performance is similar to that of human subjects performing the same task. Neurons in 
the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) encode vibration frequency by their firing rate, with higher 
vibration frequency leading to higher firing rate. When a recording electrode is centered in a corti-
cal column made up of rapidly adapting neurons, electrical microstimulation through the electrode 
can substitute for skin deflections in the behavioral task, and the monkeys’ performance remains 
good. Thus, sensations can be inserted artificially into the cerebral cortex.
During the comparison task, the activity of neurons in secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) 
and in frontal cortex differs from that in SI in several important ways. Cortical neurons beyond SI 
can have either ascending or descending firing rates as vibration frequency increases. Whereas 
the activity of SI neurons does not persist after presentation of the base stimulus, SII neurons 
continue to fire for a brief period and stimulus-related firing of neurons in frontal cortex continues 
throughout the entire delay interval.
During the comparison stimulus, SI neurons show firing related only to that stimulus; in con-
trast, the neuronal activity in SII and frontal cortex depends on whether the frequency is greater 
than or less than that of the base stimulus. This comparison is transformed into the subsequent 
motor act in premotor cortex and motor cortex.
In primates, recognition of objects within a visual scene is mediated by a processing stream in 
the cerebral cortex running in an anterior direction from the occipital lobe to the inferior temporal 
lobe. Disruption of tissue along this pathway leads to a deficit in object recognition known as ag-
nosia. If the lesion involves a specific region on the ventral surface of the temporal lobe, patients 
can selectively lose the ability to recognize faces. Measurements of human brain activity, using 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and of single-neuron activity in monkeys both indi-
cate that neurons at progressively more anterior stages of processing are excited by progressively 
more complex images until neurons are excited explicitly by objects rather than elemental forms. 
A

476 Chapter 23
In both monkeys and humans, a region has been found that seems to be dedicated 
to the detection and recognition of faces.
We can recognize a familiar object under a variety of viewing angles and lighting 
conditions. Physiological correlates of such invariance have been found in the form of 
neurons that fire according to the identity of an object, independently of the details of 
how the object is viewed. Progressive increases—both in the complexity of the imag-
es that activate neurons as well as in the invariance of neuronal response to viewing 
conditions—suggest a hierarchical transformation along the posterior to anterior axis.
The posterior-to-anterior transformation is accompanied by a flow of signals in 
the opposite direction. Those inputs (known as top–down) serve to direct attention 
to an expected stimulus location or to salient object features, to activate the recall 
of images, and to learn associations between visual images that tend to occur in 
sequence. The processing streams of vision, touch, hearing, and other senses 
reach the hippocampus, where experiences are stored as episodes involving all the 
sensory modalities contributing to that event.
What Is the Function of Cortical Processing?
Sensory pathways lead from receptors across synapses to the thalamus and from there to the 
cerebral cortex. What operations are carried out on sensory signals once they reach the cortex? 
Clearly, the answer will depend on the sensory modality, and even on the type of stimulus 
within a modality. For example, speech and music are processed in cortex in very different 
ways.1 But one general answer holds up for any sensory input: intracortical processing serves 
to integrate and distribute elemental sensory signals in such a way that those signals can gain 
meaning by linkage with stored knowledge and can be acted on through motor behavior.
This proposal for constructing perception was put forward in a convincing manner by 
Whitfield.2 Through analysis of the behavioral effects of lesions in the auditory system, he 
noted that animals can carry out surprisingly fine sensory discrimination tasks even after 
ablation of sensory cortex and its connected regions, provided that the task does not require the 
transformation of “sensory data” into “objects.”2 He therefore postulated that the information 
present in subcortical centers related to the elemental physical characteristics of a stimulus 
(tone, wavelength, vibration frequency) can be accessed even by an animal with sensory cortex 
ablated. However, a deficit appears when the subject is required to endow simple sensations 
with the quality of belonging to objects. On page 146 of his seminal article, Whitfield concludes 
that it is the cortex that transforms physical characteristics into the percept of real things 
that are “out there” in the world. Once intracortical processing converts elemental sensory 
attributes into percepts of known objects, he continues, the animal appears to be able to 
use the result of one problem to generalize—that is, to solve a closely related problem. This 
capacity emerges because, in the late stages of cortical processing, information is organized 
as objects and concepts, rather than as a set of more or less elaborate features.
This chapter begins with a discussion of how tactile stimuli are encoded, stored in 
memory, and acted on in the course of a behavioral task. The sensory input employed 
in these experiments is comparatively simple, allowing us to gain a complete picture of 
its representation at multiple levels of cortex. We then proceed to the visual system and 
present evidence about how intracortical processing transforms sensory data about images 
into percepts of objects and movement in the real world. The visual experiments deal with 
more complex stimuli so it is difficult to gain a complete quantification of their neuronal 
representation. Yet the research is compelling because it offers the possibility to connect brain 
function to perceptual experiences—like recognizing a face—that are critical to our lives.

such activity leads to assessment of the stimulus. Monkeys were trained to discriminate 
the difference in frequency between two mechanical vibrations applied sequentially to 
one fingertip (Figure 23.1A).3,4 The first vibration frequency, f1, and the second vibration 
frequency, f2, vary across trials. The first and second stimuli are referred to as the base and 
comparison, respectively. At the end of the comparison stimulus, the monkeys use their 
free hand to press a response button, expressing one of two decisions: f1 > f2 or f2 > f1. The 
delay between the base and comparison is 1 second (s) in most experiments, but monkeys 
can perform the task even with a 10 s delay. The greater the difference between f1 and f2, 
the better the performance (Figure 23.1B and C).

the stimulus (left) and responding at the conclusion of the trial (right). Experimental sequence is as 
follows. First, the mechanical stimulator is lowered, indenting one fingertip of the restrained hand. 
The monkey uses its free hand to press a key down (KD; red bar). Then the monkey receives the 
first vibration from the stimulator, which oscillates vertically at the base stimulus frequency (f1). After 
a delay, the monkey receives the second vibration at the comparison frequency (f2). The monkey 
lets the key up (KU) and presses the medial or lateral (green and red, respectively) response button 
(PB) to indicate whether f2 was lower or higher than f1 (blue bar). (B) Results from a typical session. 
Horizontal row of boxes indicates percentage of correct responses at various base frequencies that 
precede a comparison frequency of 20 Hz. Vertical row indicates percentage of correct responses 
at varying comparison frequencies after a base frequency of 20 Hz. Note that the larger differences 
between f1 and f2 led to better performance. The complete experiment included all possible com-
binations of the base and comparison frequency (not shown). (C) Results of another typical session 
presented as curves that illustrate the percent of trials in which the monkey judged the comparison 
stimulus frequency, f2, as higher than the base stimulus frequency, f1. For the red points, f2 was 20 
Hz, and the x-axis gives varying values of f1. The green points show the reverse: f1 was 20 Hz and 
the x-axis gives varying values of f2. Measurement of performance in this manner is known as the 
psychometric curve; steep curves like these indicate proficient performance of the task and provide 
a direct way of comparing the animal’s performance to neuronal responses.

Neuronal Representation of Vibration Sensations in SI
In order to examine how neurons in SI encode vibration frequency, a sequence of brief, 
pulsatile indentations was applied to the skin with a specified frequency and a total dura-
tion of 500 milliseconds (ms) (Figure 23.2). These activated rapidly adapting Meissner 
corpuscles that are extraordinarily sensitive to quick indentations (see Chapter 21),5 so 
the train of deflections leads to a train of action potentials.6

of neuronal activity could achieve. The neuron analyzed here encoded vibration frequency 
by firing rate. For non-periodic stimuli, performance of the monkey and the performance 
available in SI neuronal activity were similar, but only for neurons that encoded vibration 
frequency by firing rate. Neurons that were phase-locked could not encode non-periodic 
stimuli. (After Salinas et al., 2000.)

Figure 23.2 shows the response of individual SI neurons to a stimulus train. Action 
potentials were recorded with an array of microelectrodes inserted into the cortical area 
receiving input from the stimulated fingertip. Over 50% of neurons exhibited frequency-
dependent modulation in firing rate: as vibration frequency increased, firing rate increased 
(Figure 23.2A). A large proportion of neurons fired in phase with each indentation; for 
instance, a vibration of 10 Hz led to a response with intervals of about 100 ms between 
spikes (Figure 23.2B). Both kinds of signal—the total number of spikes in the train and the 
periodicity within the train—carry information about vibration frequency. In theory, the 
periodicity of spikes within the train provides more information about the base frequency 
than does the firing rate. It may seem intuitive that cortical areas central to SI use the 
more informative, phase-locked signal, but two kinds of evidence lead to the surprising 
conclusion that vibration frequency is extracted from the firing rate instead.
The first kind of evidence comes from the comparison between SI neuronal activity 
on single trials and the choice made by the monkey on that same trial. The likelihood of 
the monkey making a correct discrimination on a given trial was unrelated to whether the 
spike trains were more periodic or less periodic than average on that trial. In contrast, in 
a small number of single neurons the ﬁring rate ﬂuctuated together with the monkeys’ 
decisions.7 Since firing rate seems to contribute to the monkeys’ judgment, it is the better 
candidate for the critical code.
A second kind of evidence is convincing. Having practiced the discrimination task 
for months using periodic stimuli, the monkeys were then presented with non-periodic 
stimuli in which indentations were separated by random time intervals (Figure 23.2C). 
Phase-locked neurons now fired with irregular spike trains. If the brain required periodic 
spike trains to discriminate frequency, performance would degenerate dramatically. Yet, 
the performance was equally strong for periodic and non-periodic stimuli. The choices of 
the monkey were predictable from the overall firing rate, not the periodicity, of SI neurons 
(Figure 23.2D).8
Temporal jitter in a train of skin deflections certainly affects the central processing of 
the stimulus.9–11 Under the conditions presented here, it is safe to conclude that the percept 
of vibration frequency is constructed from the firing rates of SI neurons.
Replacement of Vibrations by Artificial Stimuli
The investigators then tested the effect of stimulating the SI cells directly, thereby bypassing 
the pathway from skin to cortex.12 An artificial stimulus consisted of current injections13
delivered at the same frequency as the mechanical stimulus it substituted (Figure 23.3). 
Stimulation sites in the SI cortex were selected with receptive fields on the fingertip at the 
location of the mechanical stimulating probe. Remarkably, the monkeys were able to dis-
criminate between the frequencies of the tactile base stimulus and the electrical comparison 
stimulus with the same accuracy as that obtained with two tactile stimuli (Figure 23.3A 
and B). The accuracy was also maintained when the base stimulus was electrical (Figure 
23.3C), indicating that the subjects could form the working memory of the base stimulus 
from an artificial input. Even with artificial inputs used as both the base and comparison 
stimuli, monkeys could achieve discrimination levels close to those measured when me-
chanical stimuli were delivered to the fingertips (Figure 23.3D).
The use of direct cortical stimuli allowed a further insight into the role of firing peri-
odicity. When the electrical stimulation was non-periodic, the performance remained good 
and confirmed that firing rate, not temporal pattern, was the feature used by the brain to 
compute vibration frequency. The monkey responded to electrical stimulation when the 
stimulus site was in cortical columns formed by rapidly adapting neurons (see Chapter 
21); stimulation of columns formed by slowly adapting neurons produced no response.
To summarize, the full cognitive operation may be triggered by the signal emanating 
from a limited number of neurons in one cortical column. The demonstration of artificial 
sensation has been of importance for the new field of brain–machine interfaces,14 where 
one long-term goal is to insert sensations directly inserted into the brain of patients with 
nonfunctional sensory pathways.

Transformation from Sensation to Action
Activity in SI across Successive Stages of the Task
In the same set of experiments described above, the investigators devised a way of char-
acterizing the relationship between the stimuli and neuronal firing during presentation 
of the base stimulus, the comparison stimulus, and the delay between the two. Under the 
assumption that neuronal firing rate has a linear relationship to the stimuli, the firing rate 
(r) within any phase of the task can be described by:
r = b + a1 f1 + a2 f2
where b is the background firing rate (unrelated to any stimulus), f1 is the base stimulus 
frequency, and f2 is the comparison stimulus frequency. For a given neuron, a1 and a2 are 
coefficients that describe how the neuronal discharge rates throughout a trial depend upon 
stimulus frequencies in the base and comparison periods. The parameters a1 and a2 change

FIGURE 23.3 Replacement of Vibrations by Artificial Stimuli. 
After training with mechanical stimuli, skin stimuli were replaced 
by trains of electrical-current bursts (green) injected into primary 
somatosensory cortex (SI) at the same frequencies as natural 
stimuli. In half of the trials, the monkeys compared two mechani-
cal vibrations delivered to the skin. In the other half, one or both of 
the stimuli were replaced by electrical stimulation in the cortex. The 
diagrams on the left show four of the protocols used. The curves 
on the right show the monkey’s performance as psychometric func-
tions (constructed in the manner explained in Figure 23.1C), in the 
corresponding session with only skin stimuli (blue dots and curve) or 
electrical stimuli (green dots and curve). (A) All stimuli were periodic.

cal pulses. (After Romo and Salinas, 2003.)

over the course of the trial. To understand their meaning an example is useful. Consider first 
the firing of a neuron in the base period during presentation of the stimulus with frequency 
f1. Suppose that across a set of trials with a variety of stimulus frequencies the neuron’s fir-
ing rate increases by two spikes per second for each 1 hertz (Hz) increase in f1. Then a1 = 
2 for that phase of the task. During this period, the comparison stimulus (with frequency 
f2) can have no effect on the firing rate because the stimulus has not yet been presented, 
so a2 = 0 (unless, of course, the monkey is reading the computer that runs the experiment 
and predicts the upcoming stimulus). Consider now the firing of the same neuron during 
the comparison period. If stimulation during the comparison period itself increases the 
firing rate by 3 Hz for every 1 Hz increase in f2, then a2 = 3. If prior stimulation during the 
base period has no residual effect on the firing rate, then a1 = 0. However, in a working 
memory task such as this, the brain must carry a trace of recent events. Therefore, we could 
predict that in some regions of the cortex, neuronal firing during the comparison stimulus 
is affected by the value of the past stimulus, f1. In that case, a1 will have a non-zero value.
Figure 23.4 illustrates how the neurons in one cortical region can be characterized 
by the values of a1 and a2. Figure 23.4A presents the events of one trial: the base stimulus 
defined by frequency f1, the delay, and the comparison stimulus defined by frequency 
f2. Figure 23.4B indicates the first cortical region examined, the fingertip representation 
of SI. Figure 23.4C shows the activity of one set of SI neurons during different stages 
of the task. In all plots, the x-axis gives the value of a1, and the y-axis gives the value of 
a2. During presentation of the base stimulus (left graph of Figure 23.4C), most neurons 
had a positive value of a1 because they encoded f1 by increasing their 
firing rate as frequency was increased. The values of a2 were zero, since 
sensory neurons cannot vary their firing rate according to a future 
stimulus, f2. During the delay (middle graph), a1 values returned to zero, 
indicating that the base stimulus had no residual effect on neuronal 
discharge. During presentation of the comparison stimulus (right 
graph), the neurons had a positive value of a2, while a1 remained zero.
Activity in Regions beyond SI
The frequency comparison task requires more than the coding of 
stimulus features in SI cortex. In the following sections, we examine the 
behavior of cortical regions that operate on tactile signals successive to 
SI. Figure 23.5 shows the projection of SI to SII, which then projects to 
the inferior convexity of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region known 
to have a role in sensory working memory tasks.15 Medial premotor 
cortex (MPC) receives input from SII and from PFC; it is believed to 
be involved with motor planning. M1 is involved in execution of motor 
commands (see Chapter 24).
During the base stimulus, neurons in SII showed more complex 
responses than those in SI (Figure 23.6A, left). Many of the responsive

neurons in SII actually decreased their firing rate as stimulus frequency increased. The op-
posing dependence of frequency—some firing rates rising and others falling as vibration 
frequency increased—reflects a fundamental transformation of the signal received from SI.
During the base stimulus, a mix of neurons with positive and negative values of a1 
were found in all the frontal lobe areas except primary motor cortex (M1; Figure 23.6B–C, 
left column of plots). Latencies (i.e., time from stimulus onset until response onset) were 
longer in SII than in SI and progressively longer in PFC and MPC (not shown). Among these 
areas, no sharp anatomical boundary can be drawn to separate sensory from non-sensory 
areas during presentation of the base stimulus. In M1, very few neurons responded to the 
first vibration (Figure 23.6D, left), so this region can be considered not to participate in 
sensory processing during this behavior.
During the delay following the base stimulus, many neurons in SII, prefrontal cortex, 
and medial premotor cortex maintained activity related to the preceding vibration. (Figure 
23.6A–C, middle column of plots). During presentation of the second stimulus, the monkey 
must (1) decide whether f2 is greater or less than f1, and (2) proceed to press the appropri-
ate response button. Thus, changes in firing rate during the comparison period that are 
related to the frequency difference, f2 – f1, are of particular importance. No such responses 
were seen in SI (see Figure 23.4), but were clearly present in all subsequent cortical areas 
(Figure 23.6, third column of plots). The dependence on f2 – f1 was particularly evident 
during the last 300 msec of the comparison period (red dots). The parameters a1 and a2 fall 
closely along the line a2 = –a1. Referring back to the earlier equation and substituting –a1
for a2, this gives us the relation:
r = b + a1 f1 + a2 f2 = b + a1 f1 – a1 f2
or r = b + a1 ( f1 – f2 )

tive as well as positive values. Neurons

during the delay, also unlike in SI. During 
the comparison stimulus, many neurons 
have firing characterized by the property 
a2 = –a1. This is especially so during the 
final part of the second stimulus, as illus-
trated by the red dots. (After Romo and 
Salinas, 2003.)

In other words,when points lie close to the line a2 = –a1, 
it means that the neuron is responding as a function 
of f1 – f2; such neurons appear to compare f2 and f1.
Since the task is composed of distinct phases, 
the time course of signals is particularly interesting. 
Figure 23.7 plots the proportion of neurons in dif-
ferent cortical regions that had significant (positive 
or negative) values of a1 (green line) and a2 (red line) 
over time. The proportion of neurons whose firing was 
described by a2 = –a1 is illustrated by the blue lines. SI 
firing rates were characterized by a1 during the base 
stimulus and by a2 during the comparison stimulus. 
SII firing rates were characterized by a1 during the base 
stimulus and showed a memory of f1 during the first 
500 ms of the delay period. During the comparison 
stimulus, many SII neurons were characterized by 
a2 alone but others were described by a2 = –a1; such 
neurons encode the difference between the base and 
comparison stimulus frequencies.
In comparison to SII neurons, PFC neurons showed 
a more pronounced working memory for the base 
stimulus and a more prominent representation of the 
stimulus difference during the comparison period. 
MPC neurons were characterized by a less strong rep-
resentation of the current stimulus but by a very strong 
representation of the stimulus difference. Neurons in 
motor cortex, M1, showed no stimulus representation 
or working memory. Their activity was related only 
to the outcome of the stimulus difference, f2 versus 
f1. As would be expected, the responses began later in 
the comparison period and extended into the interval 
when the monkey actually pressed the response button.
Neurons Associated with Decision 
Making
Monkeys make errors in detecting differences in the frequency of vibration, especially 
when the difference is small. What kinds of neuronal activity are associated with errors? 
Insights can be gained by comparing activity of an individual neuron on correct versus 
incorrect trials and, more specifically, by determining to what extent any differences in 
activity could predict an error. This is referred to as the choice probability index for the 
neuron. A high value means that on trials when the neuron’s activity is different from its 
average activity in correct trials, there is a high probability of the monkey making an er-
ror.16 An intuitive way of thinking of this is that if a neuron’s choice probability index is 
very high, then when that neuron makes a mistake, so to speak, the whole brain is likely 
to make a mistake. Neurons in SI were found to have a low choice probability index. Typi-
cally, they encoded the stimuli accurately, whether the final action turned out to be right 
or wrong, although the trial-to-trial variability in firing rate of a small number of SI neu-
rons did predict errors. Neurons in frontal cortex showed much higher choice probability 
index. In MPC, for instance, the choice probability index grew during the delay period 
and peaked during the comparison period. So, errors usually do not depend on a faulty 
representation of the stimulus in the ascending pathway through SI. Most errors seem to 
arise through a declining persistence of the representation of f1 and, consequentially, a 
faulty comparison between the f1 and f2.
Earlier, it was noted that a set of neurons showed firing late in the comparison period, 
which can be represented by a1 = –a2. If the activity of these neurons is so closely related to 
the monkey’s task (because their firing rate depends on the difference between f2 and f1), 
you might expect that they contribute disproportionately to the final decision. In support

of this hypothesis, it was found that the monkeys were most likely to make errors on those 
trials when the neurons representing “a2= –a1” did not accurately encode the frequency 
difference. Errors of these neurons were predictive of errors by the monkey. 
In the experiments described above, we have examined the neuronal processing that 
transforms tactile sensation into a decision. In the next section, our goal is once again to 
characterize intracortical transformations, but now in the visual system. We will examine 
areas in which cortical neurons represent the features of objects and areas in which cortical 
neurons represent the object’s identity, such as a face.
Visual Object Perception in Primates
Object Perception and the Ventral Visual Pathway
If you are asked to describe what you see, the description will inevitably center on a world 
made up of meaningful things—for instance, “I see a badly dressed professor at the front 
of the lecture hall with an illustration of the brain projected behind him,” or, “I see a piece 
of chalk that he is hurling at an inattentive student.” It is unlikely that you will describe the 
scene by the parameters of luminance, contrast, spatial frequency, wavelength, etc. Yet, the 
objects and people in the scene could not be perceived unless encoded by the early stages 
of the visual system as elementary features. If pressed to do so, you could perhaps catalogue 
the complete set of elementary features making up the scene, but it would be laborious 
and slow. And if the lighting conditions changed, the catalog would have to be altered 
(luminance, contrast, etc.). Describing the same scene according to your knowledge of the 
world is easy and fast. It does not change if the lighting or the angle of viewing is changed. 
And so the visual world is formed of basic physical features but our subjective experience 
relates to a world formed of people and things that have significance due to accumulated 
knowledge. In this section of the chapter, we present evidence about the processing along 
the occipito-temporal axis that leads from perception of features to perception of objects.
Chapters 2 and 3 described visual processing from the retina to the posterior pole of 
the occipital lobe, where the primary visual cortex (V1) is situated. The brain’s treatment of 
visual images is not finished at that point. In humans and other primates, information from 
V1 radiates outward, in the ventral-anterior direction to the temporal lobe and in the dorsal-
anterior direction to the parietal lobe.17 In this chapter, we focus on the ventral pathway—that 
is, the processing stream that underlies how we perceive, identify, and remember objects 
that we see—but also describe one key function of the dorsal pathway, motion perception.
V1 is the point of departure for a series of visual processing steps that take place in 
the secondary visual cortex (V2), V4, and from there to the ventrolateral surface of the 
temporal lobe where a posterior to anterior stream continues in a large area known as 
IT (inferotemporal cortex). Inferotemporal cortex consists of a number of subregions; 
commonly the posterior part is called TEO and the anterior part TE; TE can be further 
subdivided into posterior and anterior regions, TEp and TEa, respectively (Figure 23.8). As 
we will see, neurons in this intracortical stream, at locations progressively farther anterior 
from V1, are selectively activated by increasingly complex visual images. From the 1980s

onward, much effort has been dedicated to understanding neuronal processing in the 
ventral visual pathway, and we shall present some crucial findings.
Deficits in Object Perception
The difference between seeing elementary forms and perceiving objects was first proposed 
by Hermann Munk in 1881.18 (Munk was the first scientist to perform precise ablations and 
careful behavioral observations in laboratory conditions, which led to his sharp insights.) 
His subjects were dogs that received either a lesion restricted to the posterior pole of the oc-
cipital lobe or else a lesion elsewhere, including regions farther anterior and lateral (angular 
gyrus). Those with bilateral occipital lobe ablation showed complete blindness, bumping 
into tables and walls. Those with more anterior lesions, sparing the occipital pole, showed 
what Munk called “psychic blindness”—they did not collide with furniture, yet they did 
not recognize by vision previously familiar objects.18 Psychic blindness was interpreted as 
a loss of visual memory, or loss of visual images stored in the occipital lobe.
The psychic blindness described by Munk has much in common with the visual agnosia
syndromes occurring in human patients (agnosia means loss of knowledge in Greek). A 
noted case is patient DF, a young woman who suffered brain damage in 1988 as a result of 
anoxia from carbon monoxide poisoning.19 DF had no problem grasping objects placed 
in front of her or moving through the world without bumping into things because the 
dorsal visual pathway was intact. She was unable however to indicate the size, shape, and 
orientation of an object, either verbally or manually: she could perform actions related to 
objects, but she had no explicit knowledge about the object’s identity. Brain scans reveal 
that her agnosia was the result of damage to the ventral processing stream.
The most remarkable form of human visual agnosia, prosopagnosia, is the selective loss of 
the ability to recognize people’s faces. Although prosopagnosic patients are aware that faces are 
faces—that is, they know the category of the visual image—they fail to identify faces reliably 
or to achieve a sense of familiarity from seeing faces of family members, famous persons, and 
other individuals they previously knew well. Although they have trouble forming memories 
of new faces, other new objects can be learned. However, prosopagnosic patients may identify 
individuals by salient details such as clothing and hairstyle or by nonvisual features such as voice.
The question has been raised as to whether a deficit in face recognition is really specific 
to faces or else might be general to other sorts of images that are scanned by the fovea in 
the same way. The bulk of evidence indicates that a lesion restricted to a specific location 
in the temporal lobe can produce an agnosia that is genuinely selective to faces.20 Later, we 
shall see that the area whose destruction causes prosopagnosia can be defined as a “face 
area” by criteria other than the lesion effects.
Images that Activate Neurons in the Ventral Stream
Discovery of Responses to Complex Stimuli in Monkeys
In landmark studies, neurons were found in the inferior temporal lobe of macaque mon-
keys that responded selectively to images of behaviorally significant objects, like hands,21,22
and additional explorations of the inferior temporal cortex revealed a set of neurons that 
responded selectively to face images.23,24 Thus, there exists a class of temporal lobe neurons 
that seem to see not bars or spots of light but rather faces and hands—they are excited by 
objects not elemental forms.
In humans and monkeys, face identity (“who is it?”) and face expression (“what is 
the intention of this person?”) are forms of perception essential to social interaction and 
survival. Even newborn infants preferentially look at face-like arrangements of features as 
compared to jumbles of face features or non-biological stimuli, suggesting that our interest 
in faces is at least partly built into brain circuitry.25
The Special Case of Faces
In the early studies in which face-responsive neurons were found, territories dedicated to this 
category of stimulus were not detected; only about 30% of neurons were face-responsive.21,24,26,27

So, what can we conclude about the existence of an area whose principal function is to process 
such images? The issue was solved first by identifying with functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) (Box 23.1) a region in the anterior temporal lobe in which signals were el-
evated selectively by faces. Once the coordinates were registered, recording electrodes were 
directed to the same region, where it was found that 97% of neurons respond preferentially 
to faces (both monkey and human faces) compared to other objects (Figure 23.9).28 Thus, 
when correctly targeted, a truly face-selective region can be identified. An elegant experi-
ment established a causal relationship between the activity of face-selective neurons and face 
perception. The investigators excited small clusters of inferotemporal neurons by means of 
electrical microstimulation while the monkeys performed the task of judging whether noisy 
visual images belonged to “face” or “non-face” categories. Microstimulation of face-selective 
sites (but not other sites) increased the likelihood of the monkey reporting the presence of a 
face. The magnitude of the effect depended on the degree of face selectivity of the stimula-
tion site, the size of the stimulated cluster of face-selective neurons, and the exact timing of 
microstimulation.29
In humans, the physiological evidence for the involvement of the occipito-temporal pathway 
in object recognition depends largely on brain imaging rather than on electrical recordings. In 
fMRI experiments, a set of regions in the ventral pathway from occipital to temporal cortex 
was found to be activated more strongly when subjects viewed real objects as compared to 
scrambled objects, textures, stationary dot patterns, coherently moving dots, or gratings.30
When subjects viewed images of objects (faces and cars) broken in a stepwise manner into an 
increasing number of blocks, regions that were progressively farther from the occipital pole in 
the posterior-to-anterior dimension showed less activation as the degree of scrambling increased. 
These results suggest the existence of a hierarchical axis along which the neuronal properties 
shift in sensitivity from local object features to a more global and holistic representation.31
Presentation of different categories of images activates neurons in different locations.32
The most category-specific regions are found at the anterior extreme of the ventral pathway 
in an area known as the parahippocampal place area (PPA—activated by observation of 
places, buildings, landscapes) and in the fusiform face area (FFA—activated, as the name 
implies, by observation of faces).33,34 This is presumably the homologous center in humans 
to the face-selective region found in monkeys.28

areas of the temporal lobe of macaque monkeys. High levels of activity 
detected in fMRI experiments are colored yellow–red. Electrodes were 
directed to such areas, as indicated schematically on the right side. 
(B) Once the electrodes reached the target area, neuronal responses 
were measured. Six categories of stimulus were presented (pictures 
of faces, bodies, fruits, gadgets, hands, and scrambled patterns), with 
16 individual images per category. The bars give the mean strength of 
response of all 286 cells tested to all 96 stimuli, and it is clear that most 
neurons in the selected brain region produced a strong response to 
face images and much weaker responses to all other categories. The 
responses to some non-face stimuli, like the apple and the clock, 
might have occurred because they contained some face-like features. 
Mean response (y-axis) was calculated as a proportion of each neu-
ron’s strongest response to any stimulus. (After Freiwald, Tsao, and 
Livingstone, 2009.)

A fascinating fMRI experiment suggested that activation in face-selective areas in 
humans is related to the act of perceiving a face, not just to the processing of images with 
a face-like form or contour. Subjects viewed the Rubin vase–face illusion for periods of 9 
seconds and indicated whether they perceived the vase or the face. In those intervals when 
subjects perceived a face, there was a larger signal in the face-selective regions of the ventral 
stream as compared to intervals when they perceived a vase (Figure 23.10). All the while, 
the physical stimulus remained constant, so the variation in cortical activation could only 
be correlated with what the subjects perceived.35
Perceiving the presence of a face and recognizing the identity of the particular face are 
related but not equivalent operations. There is evidence that the fusiform face area con-
tributes to both operations. In this region, the magnitude of the fMRI signal is correlated 
on a trial-by-trial basis with successful face identification.36
Perceptual Invariance and Neuronal Response Invariance
Although we see a familiar object many times and recognize it each time, its image as it 
falls on the retina is never exactly the same. If the activity of object-responsive neurons 
in the temporal lobe truly underlies our identification of objects, one would expect their 
responses to be to some degree tolerant to changes in viewing conditions that affect object 
appearance but not identity. Can we confirm such invariance in the human temporal lobe 
using brain-imaging methods? Each voxel (1 unit of brain volume scanned) in an fMRI 
experiment reports the strength of activation of many thousands of neurons, giving a spatial 
resolution far too poor to investigate individual inferotemporal neurons.
■  BOX 23.1
Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
has changed neuroscience by allowing investi-
gators to visualize the activation of the brain in 
healthy human subjects during cognitive tasks. 
The signal on which the image is based is related 
to changes in blood volume, oxygen consump-
tion, and blood flow during brain activity. The 
method relies primarily on measurement of the 
blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. 
As neurons do not have internal reserves for glu-
cose and oxygen, an increase in activity requires 
more glucose and oxygen to be delivered rapidly 
through the blood stream. Through a process 
called the hemodynamic response, blood flows 
to the active neurons and astrocytes at a greater 
rate than to inactive neurons (see Chapter 10). 
This extra supply of blood results in a surplus of 
oxygen-bound hemoglobin in the veins of the 
active area. The ratio between oxygen-bound 
and oxygen-free hemoglobin is the BOLD signal 
obtained by the fMRI machine.
The physical principle for detecting the BOLD 
signal depends on magnetism: oxygenated and 
deoxygenated hemoglobin react differently to the 
magnetic field that is applied inside the fMRI ap-
paratus. The differential reaction to the magnetic 
field makes it possible to detect the heightened supply of 
oxygenated blood present in active brain tissue.
The change in blood flow induced by neuronal activity 
is not instantaneous; indeed, there is a lag of approximately 
1–5 seconds. The delay between electrical activity and BOLD 
signal is known as the hemodynamic lag, and it limits the 
temporal precision with which fMRI can detect neuronal re-
sponses to stimuli. The spatial resolution is about 1 millimeter.
Brain Activity as Revealed by Averaging fMRI Scans across a Group of 
20 Subjects. The scans are a view of the midline structures of the right side of 
the brain in a sagittal plane. To produce the activation shown on the left, subjects 
received pleasant visuo-tactile stimulation; they looked at pictures of agreeable 
things like silk and roses while touching the same objects. To produce the activa-
tion shown on the right, the subjects received unpleasant visuo-tactile stimula-
tion; they looked at pictures of disagreeable things like worms and slugs while 
touching objects with tactile properties similar to the pictured objects. Areas in 
which the BOLD signal was significantly higher than that under a control condition 
(experience of neutral emotions) are denoted in color. Note that the two types of 
stimulation activated different brain regions, providing some insight into the areas 
involved with feeling pleasure and disgust. (Scans courtesy of G. Silani.)

As a way around the spatial constraints, investigators have used an adaptation pro-
cedure to look for response invariance. The idea is that if the excitation of a neuronal 
population is related specifically to the viewing of a particular object, then repetition of 
that image at a high rate will excite the neurons progressively less until their response 
reaches some low, steady-state level; at that point, the neurons have adapted. Next, a new 
image is presented. If it portrays the same object but is made up of altered elemental 
features (e.g., size, contrast, or color), then that object will be processed by these same, 
adapted neurons and the overall response will be suppressed. If the new image portrays a 
different object, it will activate a different set of neurons; these, being in the non-adapted 
state, will give a large response.
As a test for invariance to viewing conditions, the image of one object was shown 
repetitively to human subjects. fMRI signals in a temporal lobe region known as posterior 
fusiform (homologous to inferotemporal in monkeys) continued to adapt even when size, 
visual field position, direction of illumination, or viewing angle varied from one single 
image to the next. If viewing conditions remained constant but object identity varied from 
one image to the next, responses of neurons in this region did not adapt. These results 
suggest that the neuronal populations in the posterior fusiform region fired according to 
their selectivity for the identity of the object, independently of the viewing conditions.37
Electrophysiological recordings in monkeys have the single-neuron resolution neces-
sary to investigate response invariance more directly (Figure 23.11). Certain classes of 
inferotemporal neurons in monkeys respond with a similar strength when an image is 
placed before the eyes independently of size, contrast, angle of lighting, blurring, spatial 
frequency, and position in the visual field.38 Some of these neurons are excited by a particular 
face, even at different viewing angles. Invariance is learned by exposure to the same object 
across changing views.39,40 Theoretical accounts for the generation of invariance have been 
proposed,41,42 but collecting adequate experimental data is difficult.
Dorsal Intracortical Visual Pathways and Motion Detection
While visual perception has been discussed until now in relation to the ventral pathway 
processing involved in the recognition of objects, another essential function of vision is the 
analysis of motion. Motion is analyzed by the dorsal, magnocellular-parietal visual pathway 
(Figure 23.12A; see also Chapter 3). Magnocellular pathway neurons are sensitive to moving 
stimuli, and this trait is maintained through V1 and V2. From there, the dorsal stream is 
directed toward the parietal lobe. A key region in the dorsal pathway is the middle temporal

(MT) cortex, also known as visual area 5 (V5). Area MT is located in the posterior bank 
of the dorsal part of the superior temporal sulcus (Figure 23.12B).
In a comprehensive and elegant series of experiments, Newsome and his colleagues 
have analyzed how activity of neurons in area MT allows a monkey to assess the direction 
of movement. In many respects, the results are consistent with those described above for 
perception of vibration frequency.
The procedure is to teach monkeys to respond to the direction in which a visual stimu-
lus is moving, while recordings are made with a microelectrode from the active neurons. 
Area MT is retinotopically mapped.43 Neurons selective for the speed and direction of a 
moving stimulus are clustered together in columns with a similar preferred direction.44–47
Such neurons respond poorly or not at all to motion in the opposite, or null, direction. 
When small regions of MT are chemically lesioned with a neurotoxin, a monkey’s ability to 
detect a moving pattern of dots in a corresponding region of the visual field is impaired.48

Neurons to Changes in Viewing Angle and Stimulus Size. (A) 
Each form resembles a wire paper clip bent into an arbitrary three-
dimensional shape. During training, the monkey learned to identify 
specific wire shapes, with each shape seen from one specific view-
ing angle. During testing, wire forms were projected onto the screen 
at the angle familiar to the monkey but also at angles never seen 
before. The histograms show the activity of one neuron, in firing rate 
across time, summated over several trials, when a familiar target 
was presented at different angles (angles of rotation in the horizontal 
or vertical plane are indicated on each panel). Stimulus onset is at 0 
milliseconds (ms). The neuron’s response was strong when the form 
was presented at the familiar viewing angle (central panel; 0°) and at 
angles ranging from –12° to +36°. For larger rotations, the neuron no 
longer fired, its response resembling that to unfamiliar objects. Thus, 
we could say the neuron recognized the form unless it was rotated 
so much as to be unfamiliar. (B) Reponses of two inferotemporal neu-
rons, one designated in blue and one in red, to presentation of imag-

randomly across presentations, from 1° to 6° of visual field. The plot 
on the left shows that both neurons fired for the stimulus at levels of 
40–100% of maximum firing rate even when image size differed. The 
plots on the right show the two objects at differing sizes. Below each 
image, the neuronal firing rate, averaged across trials, is plotted for 
the 300 ms interval immediately after stimulus presentation. (A after

Area MT is involved in visual tracking. This was shown by experiments in which a 
monkey was trained to track a moving target with its eyes (Figure 23.13).49 The normal 
pattern of eye movements is seen in the upper record in Figure 23.13 in which the moving 
target (trajectory begins at time 0) was acquired by a rapid saccade (the downward deflection 
occurring 200 ms later) and then retained on the fovea by an accurate tracking or smooth 
pursuit process. After a small injection of neurotoxin (ibotenic acid) into 
the foveal region of MT cortex, the monkey’s ability to track the moving 
target was markedly impaired. In particular, after the initial saccade, the 
subsequent tracking velocity was much slower than the target velocity. 
The deficit is visible in the traces in the lower record in Figure 23.13. That 
underestimation also applies to the initial saccade made by the lesioned 
animal. It positioned the eye as though the estimated velocity were lower

FIGURE 23.13 Involvement of MT in Tracking Visual Motion. A monkey 
was trained to track a moving target (stimulus path shown by red line), and its 
eye position relative to the target is shown in the upper record. After an initial 
saccade to center the target on the fovea (the rapid downward eye deflection), 
the eye closely followed the target path. After injection of a neurotoxin in area 
MT (lower record), the initial saccade was too large and overshot the target, 
and subsequent tracking was slower than required, as though the computa-
tion of target speed were faulty. (From Newsome and Wurtz, 1988.)

than the actual velocity. Somehow, the lesion perturbed the ability of area MT to compute 
an accurate estimate of target velocity.
How is motion computed in area MT? As stated earlier, cells are clustered into columns of 
similar preferred directions across the retinotopic map. Thus, the movement of a target across 
the retina ought to activate those columns aligned with the direction of movement. But moving 
visual targets will not activate only one such column, being more likely to exhibit a complex 
patterns of motion that activate many sets of directionally tuned neurons to varying degrees. 
Thus, it will require some form of neural computation to derive an average movement vector.
Newsome and his colleagues studied the neural arithmetic performed by multiple 
direction columns, using electrical microstimulation to alter eye movements in trained 
monkeys.50 The columnar organization means that the cells affected by microstimulation 
had similar functional properties. The microelectrode that recorded the preferred direction 
of a column of cells was then used to pass amounts of current to activate that same column 
during a target-tracking eye movement (Figure 23.14). Then, the tracking eye movement 
was compared with and without electrical stimulation to ask how components of the visual 
motion map sum. Eye position tracked target position closely in the control condition 
(Figure 23.14A). When electrical stimulation activated an MT column whose directional 
preference was different from that of the moving target, the resulting eye movement lay 
somewhere between the actual direction of the target and the preferred direction of the 
stimulated cells. The stimulation “pulled” the monkey’s eye movement towards the direction 
associated with the stimulated cells (Figure 23.14B).
The conclusion is that the vectorial average of the activated direction columns ultimately 
sets the eye movement direction. An appealing feature of these experiments is that the 
monkey’s behavior (eye movements) is a direct measure of the analysis made by higher 
centers in the cortex. Similar vector averaging has long been known to occur during the 
generation of saccadic eye movements and will be seen in motor cortex in Chapter 24.51
Additional insights into the function of area MT came from experiments in which the 
monkey viewed sequential pairs of random dot stimuli moving in one of four possible 
directions.52 This first stimulus was called the sample; it was analogous to what we referred 
to as the base stimulus in the earlier fingertip vibration experiments.  It was followed after 
a brief delay by a second stimulus referred to as the test, analogous to the comparison 
stimulus in the fingertip vibration experiment (Figure 23.15A).

FIGURE 23.14 The Direction of Eye Movements Can Be Altered 
by Electrical Stimulation in Area MT. (A) Eye movements were re-
corded in response to a moving visual target. Earlier, an electrode had 
been inserted into area MT, and the preferred direction of cells in that 
location was noted. This preferred direction differed from that of the 
moving target. (B) When this location in area MT was stimulated electri-
cally, the resulting eye movements were biased in the preferred direc-
tion of cells in the stimulated region. These results suggest that visual 
motion is computed as the vector sum of several preferred directions in 
area MT. (After Groh, Born, and Newsome, 1997.)

At the end of each trial, the monkey pressed one of two buttons to indicate whether the 
direction of motion of the test stimulus was the same as or different from that of the sample. 
A microelectrode for recording and stimulating was placed in a column in area MT con-
taining neurons tuned to a specific direction (Figure 23.15B). On trials with no electrical 
stimulation of area MT, the monkey performed nearly perfectly because the difference in 
direction between the sample and the non-matching test stimuli was large (at least 90 degrees). 
On some trials, microstimulation was applied in area MT during presentation of the sample 
stimulus. Stimulation applied during the sample stimulus strongly inﬂuenced performance, 
biasing the monkey to choose, as the match, a test stimulus whose motion matched the 
preferred direction of the stimulated column rather than the direction of sample stimulus 
(Figure 23.15B and C). This experiment indicates that the neuronal activity inserted into the 
brain by the investigator can be stored and used for future comparison, much like what was 
shown in the vibration working memory task described earlier in the chapter.

stream are to some degree akin to those in the somatosensory system, we now return to the 
discussion of the ventral stream. In a recent set of studies, investigators tried to understand 
how neurons in inferotemporal cortex build up responses to complex shapes.53,54 They 
focused on the selectivity of many of these neurons for two-dimensional boundary shape.

FIGURE 23.15 Area MT Microstimulation Affects a Working 
Memory Task. (A) Schematic illustration of the task. After monkeys 
fixated on the small red square, they were presented with a random 
dot stimulus for 500 milliseconds (ms; sample). The stimulus consisted 
of dots moving in a direction determined by a probability distribution 
whose mean was in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, 
left, right). Following a 1500-ms delay period with no image, the test 
stimulus was presented for 500 ms. The test stimulus consisted of 
dots moving coherently in either the same direction as in the sample, 
or in the opposite direction. The monkeys indicated whether the test 
stimulus matched the direction of the sample by pressing a button. For 
each sample direction, half of the test stimuli were the same direction 
as the sample and half were in the opposite direction. On half of the 
trials, microstimulation was applied during the sample period. (B) Direc-
tion tuning of a sample MT multi-unit site at which electrial stimulation 
was applied. Firing rate (action potentials/second) is plotted in relation 
to moving dot direction. The preferred direction of the cells at this site 
was for motion to the right or down and to the right. (C) Behavioral data 
from one experiment. The plot shows the percentage of trials on which 
the monkey reported that the test matched the direction of the sample 
for each of the four possible sample directions. In the no stimulation 
condition (green line), the monkey reported a match roughly 50% of the 
time for all four directions, leading to an average of about 90% correct, 
as the test actually matched the sample exactly half the time. When 
microstimulation was applied (red line) to the same site whose tuning 
is depicted in (B), the monkey reported a match for nearly every trial 
in which the test stimulus was rightward and for most trials when the 
test stimulus was downward. By contrast, the monkey almost never 
reported a match when the test was leftward. This outcome indicates 
that microstimulation during presentation of the sample biased the 
monkey’s perception of the motion toward the preferred direction of the 
stimulated cells. (After Cohen and Newsome, 2004.)

and posterior TEp; see Figure 23.8). For each neuron studied, the monkey was presented in 
rapid succession with ~1,000 stimuli in which shape characteristics varied in small steps to 
provide a rich and quantifiable dataset. From the responses to the full stimulus set, neurons 
were fitted with tuning curves. The main result is that combinations of elementary forms, 
such as oriented curves and contour fragments, formed the tuning curve of these neurons.
In a further set of experiments, three-dimensional shapes were used. Since this experi-
ment entailed an even larger set of potential stimuli, the investigators developed a clever 
technique whereby new generations of stimuli evolved continuously according to neuronal 
responsiveness to the stimuli in the previous generation. The new generation contained 
combinations of features that previously were found to excite the neuron. The method 
allowed the experimenters to quickly converge upon the optimal stimulus shape for every 
neuron. The main result is that the way the inferotemporal neurons encoded both two- and 
three-dimensional images was consistent with a buildup of complex properties based on 
the integration of simpler properties.
Speed of Processing
The operations necessary to extract meaning from an image—feature selection, recom-
bination, comparison to memory—invoke the idea of an arduous and time-consuming 
process, yet visual analysis can be effortless and fast. When presented with images that are 
flashed for as little as 20–80 ms, human subjects can make complex judgments about the 
content of the scene before them. They can reliably determine whether or not the scene 
contains an animal (motor response: “go”) or does not (“no-go”). In a different task, they 
can determine the presence or absence of food. How much time does the brain need to 
extract this information? Reaction measures, like “go” versus “no-go,” are imprecise because 
they include the time required for response execution.
A better approach is to look for the first sign in the brain’s electrical activity that dis-
tinguishes between go versus no-go trials. It has been found from such experiments that 
a scalp potential related to response inhibition on no-go trials becomes evident roughly 
150 ms after stimulus onset.55 Considering that responses begin in V1 at 30–100 ms after 
stimulus onset,56 we can conclude that the intracortical processing that leads to extraction 
of high-level image content can be accomplished in some tens of milliseconds.
Fast neuronal processing has been seen in the monkey ventral stream, consistent with 
human reaction times. For instance, in the face-selective area of anterior temporal lobe, 
responses distinguish the presence of a face versus another category of image at 130 ms 
after stimulus onset. The same population of responding neurons identifies the current 
face from among all faces in the stimulus library 60 ms later.28
Normally, inspection of a visual scene is more extended in time, so the claim cannot 
be made that analysis always involves just one fast pass through the cortex. The timing 
measures reveal the capacity for incoming signals to rapidly access stored knowledge (for 
instance the go/no-go task requires comparison of the new image to the storehouse of 
what animals look like) and show that any given stage of processing can operate rapidly.
Forms of Coding
We have referred to neuronal coding in a simplified manner, implying that a neuron fires or 
does not fire for any given stimulus. Inspection of neuronal firing shows that this simplifi-
cation is not accurate. What are the detailed firing patterns of individual neurons, and how 
do neurons work together to represent the visual world? Are objects represented by activity 
in a relatively small number of neurons that are each selective for the shape or identity of 
a specific object (i.e., a sparse code), or are they represented by a pattern of activity across 
a large number of less selective neurons (i.e., a population code)?
The problem is intriguing and challenging. Intuition would suggest that at posterior 
levels, close to V1, information is encoded by the activity of a very large set of neurons. 
Since, at anterior levels, neurons are feature selective, then the coding of an image would 
be expected to become sparser—a smaller proportion of neurons would be active, with 
each neuron’s activity specifying a larger amount of object information. But what happens 
when the current stimulus matches the preferred stimulus of an entire population?

The experiment described earlier in which the fusiform face area of monkeys was explored 
proves informative in this regard.28 The region of interest in the anterior temporal lobe 
was first identified using fMRI responses to face images. Electrodes were advanced to the 
responding region. Individual neurons were found to respond with different magnitudes 
to a wide variety of faces so that the exact identity of the presented face was encoded by 
a population of neurons. By the relative magnitude of response in the population of 94 
neurons, it was possible for the experimenter to “decode” which of 96 possible faces was 
presented on a given trial with an accuracy of 74%.28
The distribution of response magnitudes across the population is not the only coding 
mechanism. One study found that neurons in the monkey inferotemporal cortex carried 
information about the category of stimulus according to when they fire.57 Many cells 
responded to human and non-primate animal faces with comparable magnitudes but 
responded signiﬁcantly more quickly to human faces than to non-primate animal faces. 
Differences in onset latency may be used to increase the coding capacity as well as to enhance 
or suppress information about particular object groups by time-dependent modulation.
Top–Down Inputs
Our description of functional processing in the ventral pathway portrayed a cascade of 
signals from V1 towards the anterior temporal lobe, a so-called downstream flow. But, 
information travels in the anterior-posterior direction as well, that is, from the frontal 
cortex and the hippocampus to the temporal lobe and from the temporal lobe back to the 
occipital lobe. Thus, neurons at every processing center receive feedback from neurons in 
downstream centers. Understanding of the roles of these top–down inputs (to introduce 
yet more jargon) is still incomplete, but recent work has pointed to a number of functions.
Imagining or recalling a visual stimulus that is not currently being viewed can produce 
activation in V1, as revealed by fMRI.58,59 Since disruption of V1 activity by transcranial 
magnetic stimulation disrupts visual recall, this activity constitutes one component of the 
recall of visual memories.60 Given that the activation cannot originate in the retina, inves-
tigators argue that responsibility for re-evoking V1 activity must lie with top-down signals.
Modulation of cortical processing by attention also is believed to be a top-down function. 
Directing subjects’ attention to different locations in the visual field enhances fMRI signals in 
cortical areas that are retinotopically aligned to the attended location and inhibits signals in 
cortical areas that are aligned to the unattended location.61–63 Attention to objects and faces 
enhances activation, measured by fMRI, in object- and face-selective regions, respectively.64–66
People as well as monkeys can readily learn that the presence of one specific image 
predicts the appearance of a second specific image a short time later (e.g., a plate, then 
food). Top-down inputs seem to be critical to the formation of associations between image 
pairs. In one experiment performed in monkeys, recordings were made simultaneously from 
neurons in two inferotemporal cortex areas—(1) area TE and (2) a region in perirhinal cortex 
just anterior to TE—while the animals learned associations between pairs of shapes.67–69
Even in naive animals, neurons normally fired for specific stimuli, which allowed the 
experimenters to select two images, image A, “preferred” by the perirhinal neuron, and image 
B, “preferred” by the TE neuron. The non-preferred stimuli evoked little response before 
training. Then, the animal began to learn the association: image A was used as a cue for the 
appearance of image B. As the monkey learned that A predicted B, TE neurons began to 
respond to image A, the cue. The key finding is the relative timing of spikes. When image A 
appeared, perirhinal neurons responded before TE neurons. When image B appeared soon 
thereafter, perirhinal neurons responded after the TE neurons. Thus, TE neurons received 
signals about their preferred stimulus, B, through a posterior-to-anterior flow of visual sensory 
information, while they received signals that cued the future appearance of stimulus A by 
an anterior-to-posterior flow of information. Additional experiments identified the frontal 
cortex as the source of the top-down information flow during cued recall.
Further Processing
The hippocampal formation, a structure lying medial to the cerebral cortex, receives input 
from all sensory modalities through their cortical processing streams (see Chapter 16). It

encodes and then stores events, experiences, and episodes, and is also essential to the pro-
cess of recalling events. Information from the ventral visual pathway reaches this structure 
after further processing in the entorhinal cortex.
It is interesting to consider in what form a visual stimulus is represented at this level. Different 
pictures of Marilyn Monroe, even if greatly modified as in Andy Warhol’s famous portraits, can 
evoke retrieval of stored knowledge about the subject. Interestingly, the same concept of Marilyn 
Monroe (or Pamela Anderson, in the experiment in Figure 23.16) can be evoked with other stimulus 
modalities, for instance by reading her name or hearing it spoken. Is there a neuronal substrate 
for the representation of an identity independent of the sensory modality by which it is evoked?
By using presentations of pictures and of spoken and written names, it was shown that (1) 
single neurons in the human medial temporal lobe responded selectively to representations 
of the same individual across different sensory modalities; (2) the degree of multimodal 
invariance increases along the hierarchical structure within the medial temporal lobe; and 
(3) such neuronal representations could be generated within less than a day or two.
These results demonstrate that single neurons can encode percepts in an explicit, selec-
tive, and invariant manner, even if evoked by different sensory modalities. In short, if we 
take the neuronal response as a report of the presence of a given thing in our environment, 
it is tempting to believe that such neurons are the basis of subjective experience.

SUMMARY
 
■
All information available about the external world is 
present in sensory receptors, but sensory signals are 
perceived as meaningful real-world objects only after 
elaboration of these signals within the cerebral cortex.
 
■
The sensing, perception, and judgment of a vibration 
applied to the fingertip has proven to be a useful inquiry. 
Monkeys can be trained to compare the frequency of 
two sequential vibrations, the base and comparison 
stimulus.
 
■
In SI cortex, vibration frequency is encoded by neuronal 
firing rate.
 
■
Either the base or comparison stimulus, or both, can be 
substituted by a train of electrical pulses delivered to 
somatosensory cortex. The monkey senses the artificial 
stimuli as being natural.
 
■
Neurons in SI encode the base stimulus and the 
comparison stimulus separately, showing no memory 
trace or comparison mechanism. Neurons in SII and 
in the frontal cortex carry a memory trace for the base 
stimulus.
 
■
During the comparison stimulus, neurons in frontal 
cortex show an explicit computation of the relation 
between the two stimuli.
 
■
In the premotor cortex, the result of the comparison 
is transformed into the preparation of the motor act. 
Motor cortex neurons show no sensory activity but 
execute the decision transmitted to them.
 
■
Object recognition in the visual modality depends on 
processing in the ventral pathway, which courses along 
the inferior temporal lobe.
 
■
Lesions in the ventral pathway can produce highly 
specific losses in the ability to identify objects.
 
■
In monkeys and humans there are regions dedicated 
to the processing of faces. Activity in such areas is 
necessary and sufficient to produce the percept of a 
face.
 
■
An object may activate a neuron in the inferotemporal 
cortex even when viewing conditions change, a 
property known as invariance.
 
■
The dorsal intracortical pathway proceeds from the 
occipital lobe to the parietal lobe. Along this pathway, 
the region MT encodes the direction of motion of 
objects in the visual scene.
 
■
Although computationally complex, processing through 
multiple stages occurs remarkably rapidly.
 
■
Top-down inputs course in the anterior to posterior 
direction and are involved with attention, learning, and 
stimulus-free recall of earlier images.
 
■
In the hippocampus, successive to the inferotemporal 
cortex, objects are encoded in a supramodal manner.

Circuits Controlling Reflexes, 
Respiration, and Coordinated 
Movements
s in sensory systems, the neural organization of motor control is hierarchical. Smaller, simpler 
            elements are integrated into more complex circuits at higher levels of the nervous system.
            Sensory input, feedback loops, and descending motor commands control spinal moto-
neurons, which innervate skeletal muscles and constitute the final common path of the motor sys-
tem. Stretch reflexes that originate in muscle spindle afferents represent a basic automatic type of 
movement. Nevertheless, even at this level, multiple connections of spinal interneurons are neces-
sary for coordinated reflex contractions of flexors and extensors on both sides of the body. Central 
pattern generators within the central nervous system can generate complex behaviors without 
feedback from the periphery. Thus, respiratory movements, which are unfailing, regular, and auto-
matic, arise by use of a motor program that depends on rhythmical activity of command neurons 
within the brainstem. At the same time, the rate and depth of respiration are modulated by sensory 
inputs as well as by voluntary and involuntary commands from higher centers, including the cortex. 
Walking and running are mediated by programmed neuronal interactions in the spinal cord and in 
higher centers. These ensure that limbs move appropriately, with the correct phase relations.
Purely voluntary movements, such as bringing a cup of tea to one’s mouth, involve the recruit-
ment of collateral components of motor control, namely anticipation and planning. The destination 
must be defined, the trajectory designed, synergistic muscles contracted appropriately, and move-
ments initiated in parts of the body, apart from the arm, to compensate for shifts in balance and 
the effect of gravity. Similarly, if the head and eyes are moved, say to scan the horizon, corollary 
commands have to be made to allow the image of the world in the mind’s eye to remain stationary. 
For smooth and goal-directed actions to be accomplished, for the head to stay upright and the 
body to fight against gravity, complex feedback loops are required. They comprise interactions of 
structures such as the cerebellum, basal ganglia, vestibular apparatus, thalamus, and cortex, as 
well as stretch reflexes. Sensorimotor integration is carried out in the motor cortex, premotor cor-
tex, and parietal association cortex. Individual cortical neurons code for movement of the arm in a 
particular direction and are arranged in columns.
Cerebellar deficits cause a loss of coordination and balance, but little change in strength or 
sensation. Diseases that affect the basal ganglia give rise to spontaneous, disruptive motor out-
puts or a reduction of voluntary movement. Many aspects of motor control still remain obscure, 
owing to the extraordinary complexity of the circuitry and the synaptic mechanisms.
A

For a leech or a fish to swim, for an owl or a cat to catch a mouse, for a bear 
or a child to ride a bicycle, a blackbird to trill, or for Dietrich Fischer Dieskau 
to sing “Die Winterreise” muscles of the body must be brought into play in 
rapid succession, in a coordinated manner. The intricate mechanisms re-
quired for execution of even a simple movement, let alone riding a bicycle, 
pose a major challenge to neurobiologists. How you point your finger is far 
harder to analyze than how you perceive a moving object. The reason is that 
in a sensory system such as vision, one can follow signals from their inception 
as they spread from receptors to second, third, or fourth order synapses and 
through the cortex. There, neurons encode in their impulses abstract informa-
tion about the stimulus, such as a face in the visual field (see Chapter 23). The 
progression is from simple to ever more complex. By contrast, in the motor 
system, one cannot simply follow signals downward from the top (the cortex) 
to find out how a voluntary movement of the body is carried out, let alone 
initiated. The ultimate events in the motor system can be readily studied in 
terms of muscles, motoneurons, and simple reflexes. But the descending influ-
ences that play upon them arise from a multitude of diverse centers above the 
level of the spinal cord that interact with one another through intricate servo 
loops. Central mechanisms that underlie our ability to appose our thumb to 
the digits of the same hand in rapid succession require motor programs and 
coordinated activity of many separate descending systems Our future ability to 
understand such events depends on knowledge of how the component parts of 
the motor system, spinal cord, brainstem, vestibular apparatus, cerebral cortex, 
cerebellum, and basal ganglia work together to plan and execute movements.
As in sensory systems, principles of organization have emerged to simplify 
the task. The first is that motor control is arranged hierarchically. Increasingly 
complex motor tasks are organized in successively higher centers (Figure 24.1). 
A second important principle is that motor output is continually updated 
and adjusted by feedback. Both negative and positive feedback loops through 
the basal ganglia, vestibular apparatus, and cerebellum are essential to the 
timing and coordination of cortical motor programs. An extra complication 
of motor systems is that every movement of limbs, trunk, or head occurs in 
the gravitational field and alters the perception of the body’s configuration in 
space. Hence, even before the initiation of a voluntary movement (for example, 
the raising of one leg), contractions must be set in motion to compensate for 
the predicted effects of gravity.
In this chapter, we begin with the synaptic organization responsible for 
spinal reflexes and the properties of spinal motoneurons, and then go on to describe how 
groups of neurons within the spinal cord and brainstem produce rhythmic, coordinated 
movements of respiration and locomotion. Next, we discuss descending influences from 
motor cortex, vestibular apparatus, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and motor cortex. How, in the 
brain of a higher animal, the decision to move an arm is made, or how voluntary actions 
are initiated, remain as important questions for future work.
Adrian, whose name has cropped up again and again in earlier chapters, long ago posed 
problems regarding motor systems, in sentences that could not be bettered: (1) “The chief 
function of the central nervous system is to send messages to the muscles which will make 
the body move effectively as a whole and for this to take place the contraction of each muscle 
must be capable of delicate adjustment,”1 and (2) “We may learn a skilled movement by 
employing certain muscles and therefore certain groups of nerve-cells in the motor area 
of the brain, but when we have learnt it we can carry out the movement with an entirely 
different set of muscles and nerve-cells—we can write our name with a pencil held between 
the toes when we have learnt to do it with the fingers. We can draw a triangle small or large 
when we have learned its shape…”2

of the spinal cord are called α motoneurons. Smaller motoneurons, called γ, that regulate 
the sensitivity of muscle spindles, will be discussed later. (Note: the terms α and γ arose 
from an early classification of conduction velocity; see Chapter 8). A single α motoneuron 
innervates a group of muscle fibers, and together the motoneuron and its target fibers form 
a functional element known as the motor unit. The number of muscle fibers in a motor unit 
ranges from a few—for example, in muscles used to extend or flex the fingers—to several 
thousand in the large proximal muscles of the limbs.
When a motor neuron discharges, all the muscle fibers to which it is connected 
contract. The smoothness and precision of our movements are brought about by varying 
the number and timing of motor units brought into play.1 Contractions of single motor 
units are not apparent as small twitches when the whole muscle contracts because the 
individual activations are asynchronous and are smoothed out by the elastic properties of 
the muscles. For example, the 25,000 muscle fibers in the cat soleus are supplied by 100 α
motoneurons. A contraction of the whole muscle can therefore be graded in 100 unequal 
steps by recruitment of motor units.
Skeletal muscle fibers are not homogeneous: some are faster in their contractions than 
others and their contractile mechanisms fatigue more rapidly. The slowly conducting, 
fatigue-resistant fibers (also called red muscles) depend on oxidative metabolism for energy 
production, while the fast, rapidly contracting fibers (or white muscles) depend 
on glycolysis. The pattern of activation of any given motoneuron is matched to 
the properties of its muscle fibers.3
Synaptic Inputs to Motoneurons
The recruitment and fine control of motoneurons to produce coordinated move-
ments requires that influences from a variety of sources should play upon them 
in the appropriate sequence and with appropriate balance. It is therefore not 
surprising that the average motoneuron receives many thousands of synaptic in-
puts4 (see Figure 1.13A). These inputs relay instructions from higher centers and 
from sensory receptors in the periphery. Inputs to the cell produce excitatory and 
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs), and presynaptic inhibition 
selectively regulates the efficacy of the incoming signals. Each time the motoneu-
ron is sufficiently depolarized, an impulse originates in a particular region of the 
cell, called the axon hillock (see Chapter 8).
Much is now known about the mechanisms of synaptic transmission onto 
this cell and the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory synapses.5,6 One impor-
tant excitatory input is from the muscle spindles (see Chapter 19): The group Ia 
afferent fibers make monosynaptic excitatory connections on motoneurons. By 
painstakingly recording from all the motor neurons supplying a particular muscle 
(its motor pool), Mendell and Henneman7 have shown that each Ia afferent fiber 
from a muscle sends an input to as many as 300 motoneurons—virtually all those 
supplying that muscle.8
The arborization pattern of an individual Ia afferent can be seen directly after 
intracellular injection of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The labeled 
Ia afferent axon branches extensively along the rostro-caudal axis of the spinal 
cord to contact members of the motor pool (Figure 24.2A). Close examination 
of HRP-filled afferent fibers allows their contacts with individual motoneurons to 
be mapped (Figure 24.2B). The convergence of Ia afferents onto motoneurons is 
anatomically discrete, each afferent making two to five contacts on the dendritic 
tree.9 All the Ia contacts onto a given motoneuron tend to occur within the same 
general region of the dendritic tree, although not necessarily at the same electrical

such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP). (After Burke and Glenn, 1996.)

distance from the soma.10 It is remarkable that a single axon collateral provides all these 
contacts, while other branches of the same axon pass by to supply other motoneurons.
Unitary Synaptic Potentials in Motoneurons
An impulse in a single Ia afferent fiber gives rise in a motoneuron to only a very small (about 
200 microvolts [μV]) monosynaptic excitatory potential. This potential corresponds, on aver-
age, to the release of a total of one or two quanta of transmitter from the four to seven synaptic 
contacts (i.e., not every bouton releases a quantum with every impulse). Quantitative mea-
surements of release were first made by Kuno,11 who dissected small sensory nerve bundles in 
dorsal roots and recorded the potentials produced by stimulation of single Ia afferent fibers.12
Single potentials on the order of 200 μV can be expected to have little influence on the firing 
pattern of a motoneuron, but they sum during brief bursts of activity to produce a buildup of 
depolarization in a process called temporal summation (Figure 24.3A). In addition, sufficient 
stretch of a muscle like the soleus can activate of all 50 of its Ia stretch receptors, resulting in 
spatial summation of all the inputs contacting different regions in the motoneuron’s dendritic 
tree (Figure 24.3B). Integration of a multitude of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs 
determines whether or not the motoneuron will reach threshold for the action potential.
The Size Principle and Graded Contractions
How are motor units recruited to produce smoothly graded movements? As already described, 
the force of contraction can be increased by bringing in additional motoneurons, and by in-
creasing their rate of firing. However, further refinement is provided by recruiting the motoneu-
rons according to their size. A motoneuron with a small cell body and a small axon innervates 
relatively few muscle fibers, so their activation causes only modest increases in muscle tension. 
Large motoneurons with large-diameter axons contact many muscle fibers, and an impulse 
from such a motoneuron gives rise to a large increase in muscle tension. When a contraction 
occurs, small motor units fire first, producing small increments in tension. As the strength 
of the contraction increases, larger units are recruited, each contributing progressively more 
tension.13 Finely graded control is thereby achieved, enabling small or large movements to be 
produced efficiently. The orderly recruitment of motoneurons is referred to as the size principle.
For example, in the soleus muscle of the cat, the firing of a small motoneuron may give 
rise to an increase in tension of about 5 grams (g), whereas a larger unit may contribute more 
than 100 g, and the maximum contraction brought about by all the motor units firing may

FIGURE 24.3 Temporal and Spatial Summation. (A) A 
single action potential in a single Ia afferent produces a synap-
tic potential in a motoneuron that is only a fraction of a millivolt 
(mV; blue trace). When the presynaptic fiber fires three action 
potentials rapidly in succession, the synaptic potentials (brown 
traces) ride on the falling phase of the previous one, so they 
build up to a larger depolarization—temporal summation. (B) 
A muscle, such as the soleus in a cat, may have as many as 
50 muscle spindles, and an equivalent number of Ia afferent fi-
bers. These all diverge to contact the majority of motoneurons 
in the motor pool. Thus, 50 Ia afferents converge onto each 
motoneuron. A strong stretch of the muscle can activate all the 
Ia afferents (only a few shown in the diagram): the individual 
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) add to depolarize 
the motoneuron by spatial summation.

reach over 3.5 kilograms (kg). Plainly, a small motor unit would be relatively ineffective if 
brought in when the contraction is near its maximum, and a large unit firing in the lower 
range would perturb fine movements. The fact that the motor units are recruited in order 
of increasing size means that each additional unit adds a relatively fixed fraction (about 
5%) to the existing tension.
The principle that motor unit recruitment adds a fixed fraction, rather than an absolute 
force increment, to existing muscle tension is also reflected in the sensory aspects of our motor 
activity. We judge weights by the muscular force needed to support them, and we can easily 
distinguish the difference between 2 and 3 g, but not between 2002 and 2003 g. Again, it is 
the relative change that is important, as enunciated in the Weber–Fechner relationship (see 
Chapter 19). Indeed much of our perception of the world is determined in the same way, and 
we act accordingly. You would not mind paying $2003 for an item normally costing $2002, 
but would be outraged at paying $3 for a $2 postage stamp.
How do the cellular properties of motoneurons help to explain the size principle? 
Suppose that all the motoneurons innervating a muscle receive the same synaptic input. 
The voltage change produced by the synaptic current in each motoneuron depends on its 
input resistance, which is a function of cell size (Figure 24.4). As shown in Chapter 8, the 
input resistance varies inversely with the cell radius. Thus, any given synaptic current will 
produce a larger voltage change in smaller motoneurons, making them more likely to reach 
threshold than the large motoneurons. As the strength of sensory input increases, larger 
and larger motoneurons will be brought to threshold.

flow into a motor nerve cell produces a change

proportional to the radius of the cell, so equivalent

tion (ΔVsyn= isynrinput) of smaller motoneurons (see 
Chapter 8). The small motor neuron on the left and 
the large one on the right, both receive the same 
input from Ia afferent fibers. The synaptic currents, 
which are the same in both cells (50 pA), produce 
a larger depolarization in the smaller motoneuron.

muscles open or extend the joints and oppose the force of gravity; flexor muscles close or 
flex the joints and pull the limbs toward the body. When a myotatic reflex (see Chapter 
1) is activated by muscle stretch (e.g., by tapping the patellar tendon to produce a knee 
jerk), the primary sensory endings in the muscle spindles of the extensors are deformed 
and initiate impulses in group Ia afferent fibers going to the spinal cord. These impulses 
produce monosynaptic excitation of the α-motoneurons projecting back to the muscle 
that has been stretched, resulting in a reflex contraction. 
Extensor muscle contraction is accompanied by simultaneous inhibition of the 
α-motoneurons that innervate antagonistic flexor muscles. This occurs because Ia af-
ferents activate spinal interneurons that inhibit the antagonist α-motoneurons (Figure 
24.5A). The principle of one group of muscles being excited while its antagonists are 
inhibited was first described by Sherrington, who called it reciprocal innervation.14 We 
have emphasized the knee jerk in this analysis because of its simplicity; but reflexes that 
play a part in bodily movements normally occur as the result of increases in tension that 
are graded, rather than the abrupt and synchronous input to all the sensory endings for 
stretch produced by a hammer.
For the sake of simplicity, a number of pathways are omitted from Figure 24.5. For 
example, discharges in the smaller group II afferents from muscle spindles reinforce the 
reflex largely by way of interneurons.15 Such intraspinal connections have been worked 
out in detail by Lundberg, Jankowska, and their colleagues.16 Inhibitory interneurons are 
also activated by Golgi tendon organs whose sensitive endings are encapsulated near the 
tendon–muscle junctions17 (Figure 24.5B). Their afferent fibers are designated type Ib, to 
distinguish them from the primary spindle afferent fibers. These stretch receptors are in 
series with contracting skeletal muscles. They can be made to discharge impulses by passive 
stretch, but muscle contraction, to which they are more sensitive, is the principal stimulus 
that activates firing. A contraction of one or two muscle fibers, leading to a tension increase

FIGURE 24.5 Organization of Synaptic Connections for Spinal Reflexes. The spinal cord 
is shown in transverse section, with inhibitory interneurons in blue. (A) In the myotatic reflex, 
stretch of the muscle spindle generates impulses that travel along group Ia afferent fibers to 
the spinal cord and produce monosynaptic excitation of α-motoneurons to that same muscle. 
Impulses also excite interneurons that, in turn, inhibit motoneurons supplying the antagonist 
muscles. (B) Stretch or contraction of the muscle pull on the tendon and generate impulses in the

of less than 100 milligrams (mg), can cause a brisk discharge. Axons from tendon organs 
activate interneurons that, in turn, inhibit α-motoneurons supplying their muscle of origin; 
thus, their action is the opposite to that of spindle afferents.18–20
In summary, the stretch reflex has several underlying mechanisms. First, impulses 
in Group Ia and II afferent fibers from the spindles activate motoneurons supplying 
their own muscles, causing contraction. At the same time, the afferent impulses are 
transmitted through interneurons to inhibit antagonist muscles. Finally, the muscle 
contraction itself activates Group Ib afferent fibers that inhibit the motoneurons to 
terminate ongoing activity.
Central Nervous System Control of Muscle Spindles
Sensory responses from muscles are complicated by the fact that the spindles themselves 
contain specialized contractile elements, called intrafusal muscle fibers (see Chapter 19). 
These fibers contract in response to excitation by a dedicated group of motor nerve fibers 
(Figure 24.6) that are 2–8 micrometers (μm) in diameter; they are also known as fusimo-
tor or γ efferent fibers.21,22 It is important to note that the contractile elements within the 
spindle do not run uninterruptedly from end to end (see Figure 24.6). As they contract, they 
stretch the central gelatinous region of the spindle in which the sensory nerve endings are 
embedded, thereby initiating sensory impulses in the group I and II afferent nerve fibers. 
Note also that the intrafusal muscle fibers, unlike the extrafusal muscle fibers, bear no load 
even if the muscle is lifting many kilograms. This enables them to contract reliably in a 
graded manner when they are stimulated by the γ-motoneurons. In principle, the spinal 
cord could command an intrafusal muscle fiber to shorten its length by 50% and be sure 
to obtain the desired result. By contrast, a simple motor command to extrafusal muscle 
fibers via α-motoneurons could not guarantee shortening to a precise length. The extent 
of contraction of extrafusal fibers making up the muscle mass will depend not only on the 
command but also on the load that has to be lifted.
The role of fusimotor fibers was established in a series of technically difficult and defini-
tive experiments on anesthetized cats by Kuffler, Hunt, and Quilliam.23 They recorded the 
electrical activity of an individual dorsal root sensory fiber coming from a muscle spindle 
while simultaneously stimulating a single fusimotor γ-fiber in the ventral root that supplied 
the same spindle. Fusimotor stimulation produced an increase in sensory activity, but no 
increase in tension of the muscle as a whole. Trains of impulses in γ-fusimotor neurons 
either accelerated the sensory discharge produced by stretching the muscle or initiated a 
sensory discharge in the relaxed muscle.
What is the function of the γ motor system and what is achieved by the efferent regula-
tion of muscle spindle discharges? When the entire muscle is stretched, the intrafusal fibers

FIGURE 24.6 Mammalian Muscle Spindle. Scheme of 
mammalian muscle spindle innervation. The spindle, com-
posed of small intrafusal fibers, is embedded in the bulk of 
the muscle. The main muscle is made up of large muscle 
fibers supplied by α-motoneurons. Gamma motor (or 
fusimotor) fibers supply the intrafusal muscle fibers, and 
group I and group II afferent fibers carry sensory signals 
from the muscle spindle to the spinal cord. Note that the 
central region of the intrafusal muscle fiber is made up of 
nuclei and that the contractile material does not run from 
end to end. As a result, when the intrafusal fiber at each 
end of the spindle contracts, the sensory endings are 
stretched (see also Figure 19.5).

are stretched as well, producing impulses in the afferent fibers (Figure 24.7A). Conversely, 
when extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers contract following α-motoneuron stimulation, the 
intrafusal fibers go slack, thereby unloading the central regions and terminating the sensory 
discharge (Figure 24.7B). As a result, information about muscle length is no longer sent to 
the CNS. If this were all that occurred, the brain could not know whether the command 
to contract had been properly executed. Accordingly, when a contraction is produced, the 
spinal cord activates both γ motoneurons and α-motoneurons.24,25 This causes the intrafusal 
muscle fibers to contract in concert with the muscle as a whole, thereby preventing them 
from going slack, and maintaining the sensory discharge (Figure 24.7C). The CNS ensures 
that the flow of information from the contracting muscle is not interrupted. As seen in 
Chapter 19, efferent control of sensory receptors is not restricted to muscle spindles but 
occurs in other sensory systems, including the ear and in invertebrate stretch receptors. 
The motor innervation of muscle spindles can be thought of as a gain control system 
that continually adjusts the length of the spindle in order to maintain its sensitivity over

all lengths of the muscle. At present, what is lacking is detailed information about 
how the firing of γ motoneurons is regulated by descending influences from higher centers.
An example of co-activation of α and γ-motoneurons is shown in Figure 24.8A26
(see also Figure 24.10). The recordings show discharges in spindle afferents of inspiratory 
muscles during respiration. Figure 24.6B shows that sensory discharges in a spindle from 
an inspiratory muscle are, in fact, highest during inspiration, when the muscle is contracted 
and short, not during expiration when it is stretched. This apparent paradox is explained 
by the fact that α and γ-motoneurons are activated together, so that intrafusal contraction 
more than compensates for muscle shortening. When the γ-motoneurons are selectively 
blocked by a local anesthetic (Figure 24.8B), the sensory fibers fire only during expiration, 
while inspiratory muscles are being stretched. 
Evidence for co-activation of large α and small γ-motoneurons has also been obtained 
from experiments on finger movements, where spindle afferents increase their firing, even 
during voluntary isometric contractions when the joint does not move.19 An additional 
complication of spindle mechanisms is that more than one type of γ efferent system has 
been identified. Certain γ-motoneurons increase dynamic responses of spindle afferents 
(i.e., their responses to the rate of stretch), while other γ-motoneurons increase their static 
responses (i.e., to the degree of stretch).27
Clearly, the motor innervation of spindles prevents the afferent volley of action potentials 
from acting simply as indicators of muscle length (see Figure 24.8). A high rate of spindle 
discharge from an extended muscle with no fusimotor activity can be the same as that from 
a shortened muscle with active fusimotor fibers. That spindle discharges do, in fact, provide 
information about the position of limbs and fingers in space is possible only because the 
central nervous system continually monitors and modulates the outgoing fusimotor activ-
ity.28 Imagine that your hand and your arm are commanded to pick up a beaker and bring 
it to your mouth without spilling a drop. If the beaker is heavier than expected, stronger 
contractions will be required. At every moment, the nervous system must calibrate how 
well the muscles have compensated for the load and must monitor speed and position in 
the trajectory as well as the remaining distance to be covered. The servo mechanism of the 
γ system, with its calibrated output to the intrafusal fibers, allows the muscle contractions 
to be regulated perfectly, even with the eyes closed. Note also that the spindle discharge 
throughout the contraction enhances the reflex drive onto the α-motoneurons and thereby 
aids the purposeful movement.
It is of interest that certain skeletal muscles contain no spindles and are controlled 
solely by α-motoneurons. An example is provided by the extraocular muscles that move 
the eye.29 Feedback is visual, and the load on the muscles is constant and irrelevant (apart 
from minor effects of gravity30).

506 Chapter 24
Flexor Reflexes
Complex combinations of muscle activity involving multiple joints and sometimes more 
than one limb are produced by painful stimuli. The simplest is called the flexor reflex, 
which is activated, for example, when one steps on a sharp object, bangs one’s shin against 
a bench, or touches a hot stove. The response is complex, depending on the location and 
intensity of the offending stimulus, but has two consistent features: (1) movement of the 
affected limb is always primarily flexion and is directed away from the offending stimulus; 
and (2) if necessary, weight is transferred to the contralateral limb. The input for the re-
flex arises from responses of nociceptive and tactile receptors in skin.31 The movement is 
determined by the interplay of networks of excitatory and inhibitory spinal interneurons 
acting on flexor and extensor motoneurons, respectively, on the side of the stimulus and 
(if weight transfer is needed) by simultaneous extensor excitation and flexor inhibition on 
the contralateral side (Figure 24.9). This synaptic activity is organized within the spinal 
cord at the segmental level and is supplemented by inputs from higher centers that serve 
to maintain balance and mediate the appropriate continuation or cessation of movement.
In the absence of higher control mechanisms, spinal reflexes would inevitably give 
rise to oscillations: as a flexor muscle contracts it stretches its extensor antagonist. If there 
were no overriding control mechanisms, the extensor would in turn contract and thereby 
re-stretch the flexor, and so on. Indeed, a major function of higher centers, such as the basal 
ganglia (see below), is to guarantee smooth movements and to prevent spasticity, tremor, and 
clonus from occurring. Such symptoms appear in patients with lesions of descending tracts.
Generation of Coordinated Movements
There is an important difference between simple reflexes and coordinated, rhythmical move-
ments. For several patterned motor acts, sensory feedback is not a prerequisite. For example, 
during birdsong, movements of the muscles follow each other in a rapid, orderly sequence 
without sufficient time for a feedback loop to be completed.32 The next instructions are 
sent out from the central nervous system before it can analyze the preceding sound. After 
the CNS of a leech or a cockroach has been dissected out of the body and deprived of all 
sensory inputs, it continues to generate impulses in patterns that would normally result in 
swimming or walking. The presence of autonomous central pattern generators does not 
mean that feedback from the periphery is ignored entirely during behavior of the intact 
animal.33 For example, if the dorsum of the foot of a walking cat touches a small twig dur-
ing the swing phase (see Figure 24.14), the foot will be lifted elegantly over the twig. The 
role of sensory feedback is to modulate ongoing motor programs in accordance with the 
organism’s needs and in response to unpredicted challenges imposed by the external world.
Two examples—respiration and walking—will be used to illustrate how central pattern 
generators within the mammalian CNS produce coordinated movements. 
Neural Control of Respiration
Ceaseless rhythmical contractions of respiratory muscles ensure that oxygen and carbon 
dioxide can be exchanged between the blood and the lungs until the moment that one 
dies. To ensure that normal and premature babies can breathe as soon as they are born, 
programmed respiratory movements of the rib cage are already made in embryos (obvi-
ously without intake of oxygen). The respiratory rhythm is relentless and unfailing: you 
can commit suicide by not eating, but you cannot decide not to breathe any more. Never-
theless, this automatic behavior is modulated by sensory feedback and, within limits, can 
be controlled by the will.
The diaphragm and two antagonistic sets of muscles are responsible for drawing air into 
the lungs and expelling it. During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and the rib cage is 
raised by the external intercostal muscles (Figure 24.10). As a result, the volume of the chest 
is increased, the lungs expand, and air enters. Expiration is achieved by relaxation of the 
diaphragm and contraction of the internal intercostal muscles. Other muscles of the thorax

Excitation of Aδ pain fibers results in 
elevation of the thigh (synaptic connec-
tions not shown) and flexing of the knee 
joint by polysynaptic excitation of flexor 
motoneurons and inhibition of extensors 
(blue interneurons are inhibitory). Also

Circuits Controlling Reflexes, Respiration, and Coordinated Movements 507
an anesthetized cat is shown in Figure 24.10B. Activity of each muscle is registered by strain 
gauges and by recording its electrical activity with wire electrodes embedded in the body 
of the muscle; that is, by electromyography (EMG). Figure 24.10B shows that inspiratory 
and expiratory muscle contractions are accompanied by bursts of potentials, indicating 
motor unit discharges; it is apparent that the two sets of muscles contract out of phase.
As in limb muscles, the stretch reflex contributes to movement by maintaining the excitability 
of motoneurons. When the internal and external intercostal muscles are stretched alternately 
by commands from the central nervous system, their Ia afferent fibers fire at high frequencies. 
Those impulses contribute excitatory synaptic potentials to the homonymous motor neurons 
(i.e., motor neurons supplying the same muscle) and, through interneurons, contribute inhi-
bition to the motor neurons of antagonist muscles. Figure 24.11 shows the effect on muscle 
fiber discharge activity, as an inspiratory muscle (the levator costae) is stretched by pulling on 
its tendon. With each inspiration of the animal, the electromyogram shows a burst of spikes. 
The activity is enhanced when the muscle is lengthened, but the basic rhythm is hardly altered.
As shown earlier in Figure 24.8, the afferent discharge from muscle spindles is maintained 
at a high frequency, even when the muscles are actively contracting, owing to activity of 
the fusimotor γ-efferent fibers.26 Fusimotor activity presets muscle spindles for the length 
change expected during that half cycle. If an unexpected obstruction in the airway were 
to prevent the expected movement, the sensory endings in the muscle spindle would be 
stretched and would fire and increase excitation to the respiratory motoneurons.
Where is the pattern generator for respiration situated and how does it generate the 
rhythm?35 Within the pons and medulla, there are pools of neurons that fire during inspira-
tion or expiration and produce excitation and inhibition of respiratory motor neurons.35 For 
example, during inspiration, the motoneurons supplying external intercostal (inspiratory)

muscles are depolarized by a barrage of EPSPs arising from neurons in 
higher centers of the medulla or pons, causing bursts of action potentials. 
The inspiratory phase is terminated by a burst of inhibitory potentials 
to the inspiratory neurons from intermingled expiratory neurons.36
An example of individual rhythmically active brainstem neurons, 
recorded from the isolated CNS of a neonatal opossum, is shown in 
Figure 24.12.37 The upper trace in Figure 24.12B is an extracellular 
record from a single neuron in the medulla, showing short bursts 
of impulses with a period of about 2 seconds (s). In the lower trace, 
recordings from a thoracic ventral root show corresponding rhythmic 
discharges of motoneurons supplying inspiratory muscles, occurring 
at the same frequency and with a slight delay.
In principle the rhythmical activation of inspiratory and expira-
tory motoneurons could be achieved in two ways: (1) neurons within 
the brainstem might have inherently rhythmical properties, like 
heart muscle cells, or (2) the rhythm might originate from activity of 
excitatory and inhibitory synapses between a network of brainstem 
neurons. In a rhythmically active network of neurons, inspiratory 
command neurons would turn off expiratory neurons, which in 
time would break free and inhibit the inspiratory neurons, and so 
on. Endogenously bursting pacemaker neurons have been found in 
neonatal rats within a region of the ventral medulla called the pre-
Bötzinger complex.35 Experiments made by St. John suggest that those pacemaker neurons 
may function in relation to gasping rather than to normal respiration.38
A major technical problem, as of now, is how to record from the entire population of 
neurons in an area of the brain. With electrodes, one can measure the activity of a small 
proportion of the population or the average activity of the whole population, which blurs 
fine details. An alternative is to survey simultaneously the activity of large populations of 
brainstem neurons, one by one, during inspiration and expiration by optical methods39 (see 
also Chapters 1 and 3). An example of firing by respiratory neurons obtained by calcium 
imaging is shown in Figure 24.13. Results such as these have shown that inspiratory and 
expiratory neurons are intermingled rather than in completely separate pools. Several lines

of evidence further suggest that rhythmicity might arise from properties of the network 
rather than being driven solely by pacemaker cells. As yet, the excitatory and inhibitory 
connections of the respiratory command neurons in the brainstem have not been traced.
Of key importance for the rhythmicity of breathing is the level of carbon dioxide in 
the arterial blood. Under conditions of reduced CO2, the rate and depth of respiration are 
reduced; conversely, raised levels of CO2 increase respiration. This effect depends on inputs 
from chemoreceptors in the carotid arteries and aorta and from neurons and glial cells in the 
medulla that are sensitive to the CO2 levels.40,41 The firing patterns of individual medullary 
neurons that control expiratory and inspiratory motoneurons have been shown to be influ-
enced critically by CO2. Changes in the steady level of CO2 are translated into pronounced 
changes in the frequencies of firing of the interneurons and, therefore, of the respiratory 
motoneurons.42 By genetic manipulations, Champagnat,43 Brunet,44 and their colleagues have 
shown that a particular gene, known as Phox 2b, is responsible during development for the 
generation of neurons that respond to increased levels of CO2. Deletion of the gene in mice 
gives rise to animals that no longer breathe faster and deeper in a high CO2 environment. 
We know from everyday experience that modulation of breathing depends on voluntary 
commands as well as sensory input. You can inhale more deeply when you smell the odor 
of Kentucky Fried Chicken, maintain expiration for prolonged periods as you sing “Celeste 
Aida,” or hold your breath in an offensive toilet. While the central pattern generator guar-
antees an unfailing rhythm, it is not fully autonomous. At present, although we know that 
glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) play important roles,45 we do not yet know 
whether the respiratory rhythm arises from inherent rhythmicity of brainstem neurons, 
network properties, or combinations of both.
Locomotion
A striking feature of locomotion is that in vertebrates there is a consistent, highly stereo-
typed pattern of limb movements. In the walking cat shown in Figure 24.14, the left hind 
limb is lifted off the ground first, then the left forelimb, the right hind limb, and the right

ent gaits of locomotion: walk, trot, pace, and

foot is off the ground (the swing phase, during

toneurons are active). During walking, the legs 
are moved in sequence, first on one side, then 
on the other. During a trot, a different pattern 
of interlimb coordination is used, in which di-
agonally opposite limbs are raised together. In 
a pace, the rhythm changes again, the limbs 
on the same side being raised together. Fast-
er still is the gallop in which the hind limbs and 
then the front limbs leave the ground. LF = left

forelimb. This sequence provides stabilization by the forelimbs, while the hind limbs propel 
the animal. The tendency to turn produced by the hind limb is counteracted by the fore-
limbs, thereby preventing rotation and enabling movement to proceed straight forward. 
Such a sequence is common in vertebrates including crocodiles, rats, cats, and elephants 
(but not fish). Even in invertebrates with six legs, such as cockroaches, a similar sequential 
pattern is observed. During locomotion, each leg executes an elementary stepping move-
ment that consists of two phases:46 (1) a swing phase, during which the leg (having been 
extended to the rear) is flexed, raised off the ground, swung forward, and extended again 
to contact the ground; and (2) a stance phase, during which the leg is in contact with the 
ground, moving backward in relation to the direction taken by the body.
That the gait of a cat undergoes striking changes as its speed increases is shown in 
Figures 24.14 and 24.15. While the cat is walking, a single leg is raised off the ground at any 
one time. As the speed increases to a trot, two legs are raised off the ground at once—one 
front and one back on opposite sides of the animal. Still faster, at a gallop, the two front 
legs and then the two back legs alternate in leaving the ground. The increase in speed is 
accomplished by shortening the time that each leg stays on the ground—the stance phase. 
Thus, as the cat moves faster, each leg is extended for a briefer period before being bent, 
raised, and moved forward, one cycle in Figure 24.15. At all speeds from a slow walk to a 
gallop, the time spent off the ground by each leg as it swings forward is little altered. There 
is substantial evidence that intrinsic motor programs are genetically predetermined and 
appear spontaneously during development, independent of experience.47
As early as 1911, Graham Brown48 showed that the elementary circuits required for 
walking movements in cats appeared to possess semiautomatic properties (see also Guertin49). 
The raising and placing of two hind feet in alternation could be achieved in a cat after its 
thoracic spinal cord had been transected. 
Experiments made by Shik and Orlovsky50 (in the then USSR) and Nistri,51 Grillner,52
and their colleagues have provided evidence for the role of central mechanism in producing 
coordinated walking movements. In the experiments of Shik and his colleagues, the upper 
brainstem of a cat was transected. The animal could still stand but could not walk or run 
spontaneously. As shown in Figure 24.16, a cat with such a transection was held with its 
feet touching a moving treadmill. When a continuous electrical stimulation at 30–60 hertz 
(Hz) per second was applied through electrodes placed in the cuneiform nucleus (i.e., the 
mesencephalic locomotor region) the cat walked. Displacement of the stimulating electrodes 
by as little as 0.3 mm abolished the walking response. The stance and swing of the forelegs 
and the electromyograms recorded during walking appeared normal. Stronger stimulation 
of the mesencephalic locomotor region by larger currents at the same frequency caused

the propulsive forces of the leg muscles to be increased. But, while the strength of electrical 
stimulation could influence the force of the walking movements, the frequency of stepping was 
not altered provided that the speed of the treadmill remained constant. Rhythmic discharges 
of motoneurons that are appropriate for swimming or walking in the intact animal can also 
be elicited in isolated spinal cord segments of the turtle53 and slices of rat spinal cord.54 Al-
though such spinal cord preparations in vitro have interneurons with properties necessary for 
producing locomotor patterns,55 the switching from walk to trot to gallop is not understood.
Sensory Feedback and Central Pattern Generator Programs
Clear parallels emerge in the automaticity of breathing and of walking. For both types of 
movements, a central program orders the contractions of appropriate groups of muscles in 
a predestined sequence. For respiratory neurons in the brainstem, the drive depends on the 
CO2 in their environment. The drive for the alternation of leg movements during walking 
or running depends on a descending stimulus supplied by glutamatergic, noradrenergic, 
dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the mesencephalic locomotor region.57
Although sensory input from sensory receptors in the periphery is not required for 
respiratory or walking movements to take place, it does play a major role in their regula-
tion. Sensory feedback modulates the frequency and extent of the rhythms to be consistent 
with the moment-to-moment requirements of the animal. Thus, the rate and depth of 
respiration depend on the level of blood pH and carbon dioxide, which is sensed by 
receptors in the aortic and carotid bodies; stretch receptors in the lungs also modulate the 
rhythm.56 Similarly, muscle and joint receptors play a key role in modulating the speed of 
locomotion. For example, the experiment in Figure 24.16 showed that when the treadmill 
was accelerated during constant electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor 
region, the locomotion of the cat changed from walking to trotting and then to galloping. 
Sensory feedback plainly controls the rate of stepping at greater treadmill speeds.57 As the 
stance phase shortens, the leg moving to the rear on the treadmill becomes extended more 
rapidly. It therefore takes less time to reach the point at which afferent signals initiate the 
swing phase in which the leg is lifted and swung forward. As, expected, cutting dorsal roots 
abolishes the response to different treadmill speeds but not the walking evoked by electrical 
stimulation. Afferent feedback has been shown also to control human gait.58

cephalic locomotor region (MLR in the diagram) causes the animal to walk on the treadmill. Elec-
tromyographs associated with locomotor activity are recorded by electrodes in limb muscles. The 
speed of walking or galloping depends on the rate of the treadmill. Increasing the strength or the 
rate of stimulation increases the strength of limb movements (as though the animal were walking 
uphill) but not their speed. (After Pearson, 1976.)

Organization of Descending Motor Control
Up to this point, the analysis of motor systems has presented experimental findings about 
how movements made by muscles are initiated and controlled. That material is not easy to 
grasp because of the complexities of the muscle spindle, to say nothing of such concepts 
as the co-activation of extrafusal and intrafusal muscle fibers. Nevertheless, the discussion 
did result in coherent schemes for motor control. By contrast, the following sections, which 
describe descending pathways from cortex, red nucleus, basal ganglia, and vestibular ap-
paratus—as well as their interconnections with each other and the cerebellum—do not 
provide a testable, adequate hypothesis to explain how coordinated, smooth, tremor-free, 
voluntary movements of the body are initiated or controlled. Moreover, another complex 
idea must be introduced, which is that the planning of a movement usually requires adequate 
compensatory muscle contractions for balance to be maintained, and those movements 
must be initiated before the action starts.
Terminology 
It has been emphasized in this book that knowledge of anatomy is a prerequisite for un-
derstanding the physiology of the nervous system; anatomy, imaging, and lesions are not 
sufficient on their own, however, to explain complex functions, such as those involved in 
coordinated voluntary movements. Nevertheless, it is necessary to be able to recognize the 
names of structures and have some idea of their locations if one is to discuss function. For 
readers not familiar with the nervous system, terms like medial vestibulospinal tract may 
seem as bewildering as those used by high-energy physicists. Fortunately, anatomists have 
maintained some rigor in naming fiber tracts. A pathway is named according to its origin 
first (e.g., the vestibular nucleus in the brainstem) and then its termination (spinal cord). 
If two or more pathways from the same source run in the spinal cord, their individual 
locations are specified as medial or lateral, ventral or dorsal. Appendix C lists terms that 
indicate direction with respect to main axes of the CNS, such as rostral, anterior, and ventral.
Supraspinal Control of Motoneurons
The major descending pathways to motoneurons are shown in Figure 24.17 (see also Ap-
pendix C). These pathways can be classified into two groups, lateral and medial, according 
to their anatomy and physiological functions.59
Lateral Motor Pathways 
Laterally situated pathways in the spinal cord are primarily concerned with phasic move-
ments and fine manipulations, such as grasping or playing the piano. The lateral cortico-
spinal tract originates in the motor and premotor areas of the cerebral cortex, in front of 
the central sulcus (Brodmann’s areas 4 and 6; see Appendix C), as well as from a small strip 
of the postcentral somatosensory region (area 3) of the cerebral cortex (see Figure 24.18). 
Fibers originating from pyramidal nerve cells in those regions pass downward through the 
internal capsule and cerebral peduncles to the medullary pyramids, after which most cross 
the midline (decussate) and continue their descent laterally in the spinal cord. Axons of 
the lateral corticospinal tracts (also known as pyramidal tracts) terminate predominantly 
on motoneurons and interneurons in the lateral gray matter. An important feature is that 
many of the fibers descending from the cortex have terminal branches that end directly 
on the motoneurons controlling muscles of the digits.60,61 In humans and other primates, 
interruption of the lateral corticospinal tract results primarily in a loss of the ability to 
move the fingers independently and a deficit in the ability to perform fine, precise tactile 
movements.62
The rubrospinal tracts originate in the red nuclei (see Figure 24.17) and cross the midline 
before descending in the spinal cord to end on interneurons and occasional motoneurons 
associated with the lateral motor system. Cells in the red nucleus are arranged somatotopically 
and receive excitatory inputs from the motor cortex and from the cerebellum. Although the 
precise functional role of the rubrospinal tract is unclear, it is thought to duplicate many

of the functions of the corticospinal tract and to constitute a parallel pathway from the 
cortex.63 In primates, lesions of the rubrospinal tract have little obvious effect, but after 
interruption of both the rubrospinal and corticospinal tracts, coordinated positioning of 
the hands and feet is severely impaired.64
Medial Motor Pathways
Medially situated descending tracts provide input to extensor motoneurons that are con-
cerned mainly with sustained activities, such as stance and the adjustment of posture. Except 
for a small component from the uncrossed ventral corticospinal tract, the descending axons 
originate primarily in the brainstem (see Figure 24.17). The medial pathways include the 
ventral corticospinal tract, the lateral and medial vestibulospinal tracts, the pontine and 
medullary reticulospinal tracts, and the tectospinal tract. The cells of origin of the lateral 
vestibulospinal tract lie (as the name indicates) in the lateral vestibular nucleus. Each lat-
eral vestibular nucleus receives input from the ipsilateral vestibular apparatus, in particular 
from the utricles of the labyrinth (see Chapter 19). The tract descends uncrossed in the 
spinal cord to provide input to the medial motoneurons supplying postural muscles, with 
monosynaptic excitatory inputs to extensor muscles and disynaptic inhibitory inputs to 
flexors. The tract is involved in the maintenance of posture and the regulation of extensor

brainstem and spinal cord. (A) Cells in the primary motor area of the cerebral cortex send 
axons to the contralateral spinal cord to form the lateral corticospinal tract, with collateral 
connections to the red nucleus. Axons from cells in the red nucleus cross the midline and 
descend in the rubrospinal tract. The lateral tracts supply monosynaptic and polysynaptic 
innervation largely to lateral motoneurons (which supply distal musculature; see [B]). Other 
cortical fibers descend without crossing to form the ventral corticospinal tract, supplying col-
laterals to brainstem nuclei. The postural muscles of the body are supplied predominantly by 
the motor regions of the brainstem through the reticulospinal tracts, originating in the pontine 
and medullary reticular formations. The vestibulospinal tracts originate in the vestibular nuclei, 
and the tectospinal tract originates in the superior colliculus. (B) Organization of motoneurons 
supplying the upper extremities, shown in a transverse section of the spinal cord in the cervi-
cal region. Muscles of the shoulder and arm are represented most medially, those of the hand 
most laterally. Extensor motoneurons are located near the margin of the gray matter; flexor 
motoneurons are more central.

(i.e., antigravity) tone. The pontine reticulospinal tract descends ipsilaterally and ends on 
segmental interneurons that, in turn, provide bilateral excitation to medial extensor mo-
toneurons. The medullary reticulospinal tract descends bilaterally to provide inhibitory 
inputs to motoneurons supplying the proximal limbs.
Two other medial brainstem pathways end in the cervical and upper thoracic levels and 
are concerned with upper body and limb posture, and most particularly with the position of 
the head. The medial vestibulospinal tract arises from cells in the medial vestibular nucleus 
that, in turn, receive inputs both from the semicircular canals and from stretch receptors in 
neck muscles.65 The tract descends ipsilaterally to midthoracic levels and is concerned with 
postural adjustments of the neck and upper limbs during angular acceleration. The tectospinal 
tract originates in the superior colliculus and decussates before descending to upper cervical 
levels. This pathway mediates orientation of the head and eyes to visual and auditory targets.
Motor Cortex and the Execution of Voluntary Movement
Figures 24.18 and 24.19 show the origin of the corticospinal tracts in primary (M1) and 
secondary motor areas of the cortex. Motor control is also provided by the somatosen-
sory cortex on the postcentral gyrus.66,67 Motor cells in the precentral gyrus motor are 
arranged in orderly manner to form a somatotopic pattern of muscle organization. As in 
the somatosensory cortex (see Chapter 21), the motor map in humans is distorted, with 
disproportionate representation of the face and hands compared to the trunk.
The motor maps were first demonstrated in 1870 by Fritsch and Hitzig, who produced 
movements of the body by stimulating the cerebral cortex of animals.68 The somatotopic 
representation in humans was later mapped on the brains of patients during neurosurgery 
by Penfield and his colleagues.69 Localized stimulation of the cortical surface with brief 
electrical shocks produced movements of a restricted region of the body, for example a 
finger. The position of the contracting muscle depended on the position of the stimulating 
electrode. Noninvasive recording techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) provide similar maps of the motor cortex.70,71
The secondary, or association, motor cortex consists of the premotor cortex (Brodmann’s 
area 6), which lies anterior and somewhat lateral to M1, and the supplemental motor

area, also anterior to M1 (see Figure 24.19). Both these areas, like M1, are somatotopically 
organized and receive input from sensory association cortex (posterior parietal areas 5 
and 7).72 Premotor cortex is strongly influenced by the cerebellum, and the supplementary 
motor area is connected with the basal ganglia (see below). Movements elicited by electrical 
stimulation in premotor and supplementary motor cortex are complex—for example, a 
reaching and grasp action—and are often bilateral (see Chapter 21). Motor-related activ-
ity is observed in both these areas of human brains using fMRI (Figure 24.20). Both areas 
project somatotopically to the primary motor cortex.
What Do Motor Maps Mean? 
When motor maps were first discovered they revolutionized thinking about how move-
ments are initiated and controlled. Movement at first seemed to be controlled by a distorted 
homunculus, who represented a fixed plan for the contractions of individual muscles. Yet, 
in time that idea turned out to be an oversimplification. The concept had arisen from the 
use of electrical currents to stimulate neurons artificially. There are parallels with the visual 
system. Thus, knowledge of the projection of the visual field onto area 17 was obtained 
by flashing bright lights. While this was a prerequisite for understanding the first steps in 
visual processing, it did not on its own reveal columnar architecture, functional groupings 
of neurons, or the importance of movement and orientated edges.
Unit recordings, fMRI, and transcranial magnetic electrical stimulation have shown 
that the map of motor cortex is plastic and changes following peripheral lesions or as a

consequence of practicing to acquire a novel skill.73,74 Hence, motor maps in M1 or in 
premotor cortex are not immutable, with each mini area always controlling one discrete 
and well defined group of muscle fibers.75 A major task that remains in motor systems is to 
pursue the analysis to the level reached in the visual system. It will be shown that neurons 
with similar properties are clustered in columns in the primary motor area. Just as neu-
rons that detect a face or a particular direction of movement occur in visual areas outside 
the primary visual cortex, so neurons with complex properties for planning movements 
and making decisions are found in premotor areas of the brain. There are as yet no clear 
boundaries between groups of cells involved in the planning of a movement, the decision 
to make it, and the activation of appropriate groups of muscles—let alone in learning. In 
the following paragraphs, as in other chapters of this book, we present selected examples 
at the cellular level to describe the functional organization of the motor cortex with regard 
to movements of the hand and arms. 
Cellular Activity and Movement
How is the activity of neurons in motor cortex related to the initiation and performance of 
a movement? Do individual neurons in M1 cause contraction of a single muscle, direct the 
strength of contraction of specific muscle groups, control the magnitude of displacement 
around a joint, or move parts of the body in a particular direction? These questions were 
asked by Evarts,76,77 who recorded the activity of pyramidal tract cells in the motor cortex 
during the performance of trained wrist movements by awake monkeys (Figure 24.21).
In this and other experiments described in the following sections (see also Chapters 
21 and 23) electrodes are chronically implanted into the cortex, often for many weeks or 
even years,78 and the animal is rewarded for making a correct choice. By loading the wrist 
to oppose either flexion or extension, Evarts could dissociate the force required for a move-
ment from its direction. Early results were straightforward. Individual cortical cells fired 
impulses in association with either extension or flexion of the wrist. The discharge frequency, 
however, was related to the force required to execute the movement. This behavior of the 
cortical cells was not unlike the behavior of the spinal motoneurons to which they projected. 
Subsequent experiments showed that this particular kind of behavior is characteristic of 
corticospinal cells that end directly on spinal motoneurons.60 Other classes of cells exhibit 
more complex behavior, depending on the imposed load or starting position of the limb.
Cortical Cell Activity Related to Direction of Arm Movements 
Reaching out to grasp a desired object requires an elaborate series of neural computations. 
The object to be grasped and its spatial location are first identified visually. The position 
of the target must then be compared with that of the hand and a trajectory computed to 
join them. Finally, that spatial trajectory must be converted into coordinated contractions 
of muscles that will move the hand to that location in space. Note that there may be many 
trajectories that achieve the same goal—think of shoulder, elbow, wrist combinations. The 
choice of the most comfortable or the fastest must be selected. The way in which cortical 
neurons organize such three-dimensional movements was studied by Georgopoulos and 
his colleagues.79–81 They recorded the activity of many single units with multiple electrodes 
in the motor cortex of monkeys that were making visually guided arm movements. Neu-
rons in the arm area of the primary motor cortex discharged at maximum rates when the 
movement was made in a particular direction, toward left, right, up, or down. Preferred 
directions were not absolute; the discharges of such neurons fell off as the angle of reach 
Juice
Handle
FIGURE 24.21 Experimental Arrangement for Recording Cellular Activity related to wrist move-
ment. A monkey, previously trained to move a handle to a designated position, is seated in the chair 
with its forearm placed in a cuff. The monkey deflects a handle to the left or right between stops, by 
flexion or extension of the wrist. A system of weights, or a torque motor (not shown), is used to load 
the handle to oppose either flexion or extension. For visually guided movements, the handle position 
is indicated on a display screen. When the monkey places the handle in the designated position, it 
receives a reward of fruit juice. Single-unit activity is recorded with a microelectrode positioned in an 
appropriate area of the brain, by means of a microdrive fixed to the skull.

was altered. Further, the preferred direction varied with the initial position 
or posture of the limb. In one series of experiments, of 2385 recording sites 
that were analyzed, 985 (41.3%) were directionally tuned.
Figure 24.22 shows the intensity firing and preferred directions of indi-
vidual units as the arm moved toward its target. It is the activity within an 
ensemble of neurons that determines the trajectory. The outcome, shown as 
arrows, encodes a direction that is equivalent to the vector sum of the preferred 
directions of all the active neurons. Particularly interesting is that neurons 
with similar preferred directions were clustered together in columns running 
through the depth of the cortex (Figure 24.23B). Cells situated at the center 
of the column fired according to the precise angle in which the movement 
was made (blue arrow in Figure 24.23B), whereas those nearer the periphery 
of the column showed greater variation in the preferred angular movement. 
Columns were approximately 50–100 μm wide and spaced regularly in a 
lattice 200 μm apart from each other. Georgopoulos and his colleagues have 
proposed that the preferred, bell-shaped directional tuning curve of a neuron 
results from excitatory thalamic input to a particular column, followed by a 
mixture of excitatory and inhibitory inputs mediated by local interneurons. 
These results obtained in motor cortex are reminiscent of the way in which 
moving visual targets are mapped in the middle temporal (MT) area of the 
visual cortex (see Chapters 3 and 22). 
Higher Control of Movement
Parallels with the visual system (see Chapters 2 and 3) are once again apparent 
in higher motor organization. Thus, while much is known about how columns 
of neurons in the visual cortex respond selectively to the orientation and 
movement of a stimulus, we do not know how the whole picture is put together. Similarly, 
while we have information about how columns of cells in the motor cortex move an arm 
in a certain direction, cellular mechanisms that enable an action to be planned, learned, 
or decided on are still not understood. The description below of feedback mechanisms, 
eye movements, anticipatory mechanisms, and mirror cells provides a short overview of

evolving concepts of higher control mechanisms employed by motor areas and their in-
teractions with sensory systems.
An initial question concerns the role of feedback from the periphery in the execution 
of voluntary movements. Experiments made in conscious subjects show that it is impor-
tant but not essential. Thus, a monkey can still move its arm after the dorsal roots have 
been sectioned, but the limb tends not to be used even though the motor control is intact. 
Marsden and his colleagues82 have studied the manual motor performance of a man who 
had been deafferented by a severe peripheral neuropathy affecting dorsal roots. The power 
of the hand was almost unaffected and accurate voluntary movements could be made with 
his fingers, hand, and forearm. He could not, of course, judge weights of objects. Yet, he 
was unable to do simple tasks in daily life, such as holding a cup, writing with a pen, or 
buttoning up his shirt. Nor could he maintain muscle contractions for more than 1or 2 
seconds without visual feedback. 
A type of motor performance for which feedback is essential is the movement of the 
eyes in fixating and tracking objects. Eye movements represent a behavioral system of motor 
control relating to perception, with a controlled input and an output that can be measured 
with precision. Sensory information is derived from the vestibular apparatus and from the 
eyes themselves. To retain an image when the head rotates or to follow moving objects, the 
eyes move in a coordinated manner. Since the eyes can make only limited movements while 
the head moves or rotates, they turn slowly in the opposite direction and flick back rapidly. 
The abrupt deflections are known as saccades. (The role of the vestibular apparatus in sac-
cadic movements, in particular the semicircular canals, has been discussed in Chapter 22.) An 
essential feature of saccades, and other movements, is that the motor system makes sure that 
the effects of an action on the body will be neutralized. Thus, we do not perceive saccadic eye 
movements as visual motion. The image on the retina is stable, and we 
are unaware of the visual stimulus generated by a saccade.83–85 If you turn 
your head, the world does not seem to rotate. But, if you gently push the 
corner of one eye with your finger, the image moves (do this carefully, 
we shall not pay damages!). What is the difference between the two eye 
movements? When the nervous system sends commands to extraocular 
muscles to contract, they execute the commands faithfully. (Remember, as 
mentioned earlier, the loads that extraocular muscles need to overcome 
are virtually constant and relatively unaffected by gravity29). At the same 
time, corollary signals are sent from centers that plan the action to visual 
centers; these ensure that the degree of movement is anticipated and the 
perception of motion on the retina cancelled. When a finger is used to push 
the eye no such anticipatory information is provided to the visual system.
Anticipatory information also plays a major role in the control of 
body movements. If you raise one leg, your center of gravity shifts and 
without a correction you would fall. To apply the correction after the 
movement has been made would be inefficient and perhaps useless.
Figure 24.24 shows that what happens is that muscles on the opposite 
side of the body contract appropriately to maintain balance before the 
arm is raised by an act of will.86 In the experiments shown in Figure 
24.24, normal subjects were asked to raise one leg by 45° in response to 
a sound. Movements over the whole body were tracked, photographed, 
and analyzed and electromyograms were made of muscle contractions.

the body start to rise before the leg is raised. The importance of anticipatory compensations 
and corollary discharges has been described by Sommer and Wurtz:
Each movement we make activates our own sensory receptors, thus causing a prob-
lem for the brain: the spurious, movement-related sensations must be discriminated 
from the sensory inputs that really matter, those representing our environment…
Such circuits convey a copy of each motor command, known as a corollary dis-
charge…to brain regions that use sensory input. 87
As one considers higher aspects of motor control, the boundary between sensory and 
motor systems becomes lost. For instance, in a task in which an animal must execute the 
correct movement in response to a particular frequency of vibration (see Chapter 23), 
neurons in premotor cortex encode both the vibration itself as well as the upcoming motor 
response. As another example, the activity of certain cells in prefrontal cortex of monkeys 
and humans, known as mirror neurons, is related to both the observation and the planning 
of movements. Thus, Rizzolati and his colleagues have shown that the same neuron fires 
when a monkey performs an action, such as grasping a stick, and also when it observes 
another monkey performing the same function.88 Such mirror neurons seem to play a part 
in learning how to move by copying the actions of others (see also Chapter 23). Another 
example of neurons whose activity depends on sensory discrimination, learning, and memory 
is provided by the work of Romo and his colleagues,89 discussed in detail in Chapter 23.
Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia
This section deals with two structures (the cerebellum and the basal ganglia) that coordinate 
the movements of the body. They are essential for accuracy, prevent tremor and spasticity, 
and contribute to motor learning.
The Cerebellum
The principal anatomical features of the cerebellum are shown in Figure 24.25 and Appendix 
C. The cerebellum participates in motor control through extensive interconnections with the 
premotor cortex and the vestibular system.90,91 It influences the spinal motor apparatus by way 
of brainstem motor nuclei. Although recent experiments have provided valuable information 
about molecular and cellular mechanisms of cerebellar function, the lucid summary given by 
Adrian (again!) more than 50 years ago2 still seems elegant, clear, and accurate:
The cerebellum has the…immediate and quite unconscious task of keeping the body 
balanced whatever the limbs are doing and of insuring that the limbs do whatever is 
required of them. Its actions show what complex things can be done by the mecha-
nism of the nervous system in carrying out the decisions of the mind. If I decide to 
raise my arm, a message is dispatched from the motor area of one cerebral hemi-
sphere to the spinal cord and a duplicate of that message goes to the cerebellum. 
There, as a result of interactions with other sensory impulses, supplementary orders 
are sent out to the spinal cord so that the right muscles come in at the exact moment 
when they are needed, both to raise my arm and keep my body from falling over. The 
cerebellum has access to all the information from the muscle spindles and pressure 
organs and so can put in the staff work needed to prevent traffic jams and bad co-
ordination. If it is injured the timing breaks down, muscles come in too early or too 
late and with the wrong force. The staff work needs to be elaborate, particularly when 
the body has to be balanced on two legs and uses its arms for all manner of move-
ment, but it is done by the machinery of the nervous system after the mind has given 
its orders. The cerebellum has nothing to do with formulating the general plan of the 
campaign. Its removal would not affect what we feel or think, apart from the fact that 
we should be aware that our limbs were not under full control and so should have to 
plan our activities accordingly.
Connections of the Cerebellum
The cerebellum receives proprioceptive, vestibular, and other sensory inputs from the entire 
body as well as a massive projection from motor and association cortex. These multiple

connections allow actual or intended movements to be compared during their execution 
with plans provided by the cortex.92,93 Figure 24.26 shows the afferent and efferent path-
ways to and from the cerebellum.
The lateral hemispheres receive inputs from a wide area of cerebral cortex (via relay 
nuclei in the pons) and from the red nucleus (via the inferior olive). The flocculonodular 
lobe receives inputs from the vestibular nucleus.94 The medial zone of the cerebellar cortex 
receives proprioceptive and cutaneous input from all levels of the spinal cord. For this reason, 
Sherrington referred to the cerebellum as “the head ganglion of the proprioceptive system.”95
An essential feature of the cerebellum is that the projections are arranged in a highly 
orderly manner. Thus, the sensory inputs form multiple somatotopic representations on 
the cerebellar cortex, and these overlie motor representations in the same regions. It will

become evident from the connections that posture and stance are influenced mainly by 
the output from cells situated in the midline of the cerebellum, whereas fine movements 
depend on those situated more laterally.
Output from the cerebellar cortex is solely through the axons of Purkinje cells, all of 
which are inhibitory. The Purkinje cell axons project onto cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei 
and onto vestibular nuclei, again in an orderly fashion (see Figure 24.26). Those from the 
flocculus and nodulus (vestibulocerebellum) project directly to the vestibular nuclei. The 
remainder project to the deep nuclei in a regular progression from medial to lateral across 
the cerebellum. Purkinje cells situated in the midline of the cerebellar cortex project to the 
fastigial nucleus, which projects to the vestibular nucleus and the reticular formation to 
influence the vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts—that is, the medial motor system 
concerned with stance and balance. Purkinje cells situated more laterally project to the 
interposed nucleus, and the most lateral project to the dentate nucleus.96 Those nuclei send 
their outputs to the motor cortex via the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. They exert 
their primary influence on the lateral motor system and thereby influence the musculature 
of the body concerned with fine movements. The interposed nucleus also projects to the 
red nucleus. Somatotopic order is maintained in each cerebellar cortical region and carried 
on through each nuclear projection.
Synaptic Organization of the Cerebellar Cortex
In few, if any, regions of the central nervous system have the functional connections of 
the incoming axons and the output been traced as fully as in the cerebellum.97 In intact 
preparations and in slices, a variety of techniques, including anatomical and molecular 
studies as well as optical and electrical recordings, have been used to reveal the pattern of 
connections and their physiological mechanisms.

supplied by the vestibular nucleus.

The cytoarchitecture of the cerebellum was revealed by Ramón y Cajal98 and studied 
later in detail by light and electron microscopy. The cerebellar cortex is composed of three 
layers (Figure 24.27). The innermost layer is packed with 1010 to 1011 granule cells—ap-
proximating the sum of all other cells in the nervous system! They send axons to the 
outermost (molecular) layer to form a system of parallel fibers, each extending several 
millimeters along the folium. Also in the granule cell layer are Golgi cells, which make 
inhibitory synapses onto granule cells.
The second cortical layer is occupied by Purkinje cells, whose axons, as already mentioned, 
constitute the sole output from the cerebellar cortex. The Purkinje cell dendrites extend into 
the outer molecular layer of the cortex, with their planar arborizations oriented at right 
angles to the streams of parallel fibers. The parallel fibers make excitatory synaptic contacts 
onto spiny processes of the distal dendrites of the Purkinje cells. Figure 24.26 shows the 
way in which the Purkinje cells are stacked in a row along a folium, with the parallel fibers 
extending through them, rather like the wires laid on telephone poles. It is estimated that 
each Purkinje cell receives inputs from more than 200,000 parallel fibers. 
Each parallel fiber engages a beam-like set of Purkinje cells, extending along the folium 
and projecting in an orderly manner to the underlying cerebellar nucleus. The significance

cortex is subdivided into the granule cell, Purkinje cell, and molecular layers. 
Red cells are excitatory, and blue cells are inhibitory. The sole output from 
the cortical layer to cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei is by inhibitory axons 
from Purkinje cells. (C) The axons of deep nuclear neurons form the output 
paths of the cerebellum. Mossy fiber inputs excite granule cells, whose 
axons ascend to the molecular layer to form a parallel fiber network. Parallel 
fibers form excitatory synapses on Purkinje cells, stellate cells, basket cells, 
and dendrites of Golgi cells. Climbing fibers form excitatory synapses on 
Purkinje cells. Both climbing fibers and mossy fibers make excitatory con-
nections with cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei.

of this arrangement is that such a beam of Purkinje cells can span all the inputs from muscle 
spindles and joints in a region (for example, the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints of the 
arm), thereby providing a possible representation of the body for coordinating complex 
movements. The length of the parallel fibers is sufficient to connect Purkinje cells that 
project to adjacent deep nuclei. Hence, different nuclei can function in a coordinated 
manner. The second cortical layer also contains stellate and basket cells, which provide 
inhibitory inputs to Purkinje cells from remote parallel fibers. The arrangement resembles 
the lateral inhibition seen in sensory systems.
Information flowing into the cerebellum from cortico-pontine relays and sensory systems is 
carried by mossy fibers that make excitatory synapses with granule cells, Golgi cells, and deep-
nuclear neurons.99 Mossy-fiber excitation of parallel fibers (the axons of granule cells) causes 
simple spike generation in Purkinje cells. These occur continuously at rates of 50 to 150/s and 
resemble conventional brief action potentials seen in other neurons. By contrast, a single climb-
ing fiber arising in the inferior olive makes extensive connections onto the soma and proximal 
dendrite of 1 to 10 Purkinje cells. Climbing fibers cause powerful excitation of Purkinje cells,100
and produce large plateau potentials that lead to complex spikes.101 This activity involves calcium 
action potentials in the dendrites, leading to a calcium influx and long-term depression.102,103
Several lines of evidence suggest that during classical conditioning the conditioned stimulus is 
transmitted by simple spikes (evoked by mossy fibers), while transmission of the unconditioned 
stimulus is mediated by complex spikes (evoked by climbing fibers).
What Does the Cerebellum Do and How Does It Do It?
Entire books and journals are devoted to the cerebellum, so it is a sobering thought that 
in 2009 a review of cerebellar structure and function should have to contain the follow-
ing sentence: 
Although there is no unanimous agreement about what the cerebellum does or how 
it does it, some principles of its structure and function are well understood.90
That the cerebellum is required for the planning and performance of coordinated move-
ments of the eyes and the body as a whole is clear from electrical and optical recordings 
made in conscious monkeys while they perform trained movements. Moreover, everyday 
actions that we take for granted, such as bringing a cup to one’s mouth or sitting down, 
have to be learned in the first place. The idea that the cerebellum plays a part in motor 
learning is supported by the effects of lesions. Long-term depression and potentiation (see 
Chapter 16), which are prevalent at cerebellar synapses (such as those between parallel 
fibers and Purkinje cells or between mossy fibers and cerebellar nuclei), provide possible 
mechanisms for motor learning104 (see also Welsh et al.105). Lesion experiments and clinical 
disorders support the idea that the cerebellum plays a key role in learning, in controlling 
movements, and even in higher cognitive functions. The literature is, however, too extensive 
to be described in this chapter (see Strick et al.106 and Thach107).
Most lesions of the cerebellum in patients, whether due to disease or development, are 
diffuse rather than focal, with signs and symptoms that relate to balance and motor control.108
As one might expect from their connections to the vestibular system, localized lesions of 
the nodulus and flocculus give rise to disturbances in equilibrium and eye movements as 
well as to disordered movements of the trunk. A common feature of cerebellar lesions is 
an intention tremor during a movement, say of the hand, in which small, rhythmical, and 
purposeless trembling begins and becomes stronger. This tremor is different from that 
occurring at rest with disorders of the basal ganglia (see below).
Earlier in this chapter, we have shown that a major function of descending control to 
spinal interneurons and motoneurons is to prevent oscillations. Without descending con-
trol, oscillation would, in principle, be inevitable since every muscle contraction activates 
stretch receptors in its antagonists. The cerebellum must make the distinction between true 
sensory input from outside the body and secondary inputs from movements generated by 
the CNS.87 It predicts the sensory outcome of motor commands; then, through internal 
feedback, appropriate motor commands can be delivered to the muscles.

The Basal Ganglia 
The nuclei that constitute the basal ganglia play an essential role in motor control. Whereas 
the cerebellum is primarily concerned with phasic movements of the body (for example, 
eye saccades and finger pointing), a principal function of the basal ganglia is to regulate 
posture, counteract tremor, and maintain steady muscular contractions. Neurons in basal 
ganglia can activate agonists and antagonists together—a mechanism appropriate for sta-
bilizing a joint, such as the knee.109 Basal ganglia also cooperate in terminating movements 
and in motor learning. It has even been suggested by Kandel and his colleagues110 that the 
basal ganglia might play a role in the genesis of schizophrenia. Here, we provide only a 
brief summary and guide to the vast literature that deals with the structure and functions 
of the basal ganglia (see for example111–113).
The basal ganglia consist of nuclear masses situated beneath the outer cortical layers of 
the cerebral hemispheres. Key structures are the caudate nucleus and the putamen (known 
together as the neostriatum), and the external and internal divisions of the globus pallidus
(Figure 24.28). Two midbrain structures, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus, 
have afferent and efferent connections with the basal ganglia and are part of the circuit. 
Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (see Chapter 14) project to the striatum (the 
nigrostriatal pathway). Nigral neurons release dopamine, which inhibits some neurons and 
excites others; the overall effect of dopamine on the striatum is excitatory.114 The striatum 
receives widespread inputs from the cerebral cortex, particularly from the precentral gyrus. 
Major outputs of the basal ganglia from the globus pallidus are directed to the ventrolateral 
and ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus (with overlapping with regions receiving input 
from the cerebellum) and back to the cortex. The basal ganglia modulate motor output 
through this complex feedback circuitry.115
Synaptic transmission and integration in the basal ganglia are highly plastic. Long term 
potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) occur at glutamatergic synapses on medium spiny 
projection neurons of the striatum.116 Transmission in the basal ganglia is also modulated

putamen, and globus pallidus (external and internal divisions). Two ad-
ditional nuclei, the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus, have 
extensive interconnections with the basal ganglia and are sometimes 
included with them. The predominant input to the basal ganglia is from 
the cortex (left side, blue). Outputs from the basal ganglia go to the 
ventroanterior and ventrolateral nuclei of the thalamus, which in turn 
project to cortex (right side, red), completing a cortical feedback circuit. 
Additional output pathways project to the vestibular nucleus and med-
ullary reticular formation through the pedunculopontine nucleus.

by the gas nitric oxide (NO), acting as a local transmitter released by neurons that diffuses 
locally.117 Since it is a gas, release of NO depends on the rate of synthesis in neurons that 
make up approximately 2% of the total in the striatum.118 In the basal ganglia, the principal 
action of NO is excitatory modulation of synaptic efficacy through second messenger 
systems (see Chapter 14). 
Circuitry of the Basal Ganglia
The caudate and putamen function as the input stage of the basal ganglia, (Figure 24.29). 
The putamen receives its input from the sensorimotor strip surrounding the central sulcus, 
so its activity relates most directly to motor activity. The caudate is innervated by frontal 
cortex and is involved in higher-order cognitive processing. This parallel arrangement un-
derlies the role of the basal ganglia in cognition and affect as well as in motor processing. 
GABAergic neurons of the caudate and putamen project to the globus pallidus and inhibit 
its activity. Neurons of the globus pallidus are also inhibitory;119 they release GABA onto 
thalamic neurons in the ventroanterior and ventrolateral nuclei. Since neurons in the glo-
bus pallidus fire tonically, they continuously inhibit the flow of excitation from thalamus 
to cortex.109 The firing rate of individual neurons in the globus pallidus concerned with 
wrist movements are relatively unaffected by its position, the velocity of movement, or the 
load on the wrist. The strongest stimulus for such neurons instead is a sudden movement, 
which causes a pronounced increase in frequency after a delay. Mink and Thach109 have 
proposed that pallidal cell discharges are associated with the release of holding mechanisms 
responsible for joint fixation, thereby allowing the movement to occur. An analogy for the 
delayed firing is that of starting a car on a hill. You release the hand brake only after power 
has been applied to the wheels. The following is an oversimplified scheme of the functional 
connections of the basal ganglia: 
increased cortical activity → excitation of caudate nucleus and putamen → inhibition 
of globus pallidus → disinhibition of the thalamus → increased activity of the 
thalamocortical pathway → activation of cortex
Diseases of the Basal Ganglia
The importance of the basal ganglia in motor control is emphasized by the devastating 
consequences of neurodegenerative diseases that affect their function.120 James Parkinson 
described the “shaking palsy” in 1817. Parkinson’s disease is characterized by: a continuous 
tremor at rest (“pill rolling”), an increased tone due to simultaneous activation of antagonist

indirect pathway) and internal globus pallidus (the direct pathway) to inhibit 
GABAergic neurons in those nuclei. GABAergic neurons of the internal 
globus pallidus project to and inhibit the thalamus. Dopaminergic neurons 
of the substantia nigra produce net excitation of the striatum. Glutamater-
gic neurons of the subthalamic nucleus are inhibited by the projection from 
the external globus pallidus and excite GABAergic neurons of the internal 
globus pallidus. Excitatory neurons are shown in red and inhibitory neurons 
in blue. The gas, nitric oxide, is an important modulatory transmitter in the

muscles, difficulty in initiating or finishing movements, and slowness of movement once 
begun. Deficits are prominent in tasks that involve switching from one action to another.
A key factor in the development of Parkinson’s disease is the degeneration of dopami-
nergic neurons of the substantia nigra. However, dopamine cannot be given to patients to 
counteract the deficit because it cannot cross the blood–brain barrier and has devastating 
peripheral side effects. Instead, the standard therapy is oral administration of a dopamine 
precursor, L-amino acid decarboxylase (L-DOPA), which does cross the barrier and is used 
by substantia nigra neurons to synthesize dopamine. In brief, the loss of dopamine in 
Parkinson’s disease reduces striatal activity. As a result, there is less inhibition of the globus 
pallidus, and its increased firing inhibits neurons in the thalamus. They, in turn, provide 
a lower level of excitatory input to the motor cortex. The result is the hypokinesis that is a 
dominant deficit of this disease.
Another clinically important disorder of the basal ganglia is Huntington’s disease, a 
genetically determined disease, the hallmark of which is the appearance of spontaneous, 
disruptive movements that give this disease its other name, Huntington’s chorea (from the 
Greek word for dance).121 Patients typically develop symptoms and signs in their 20s or 30s, 
as a result of degeneration of striatal neurons supplying the external globus pallidus. 
Although lesions and diseases of the nervous system lead to behavioral changes that 
provide essential clues about normal functions, they do not reveal mechanisms. That the 
basal ganglia and cerebellum organize, coordinate, and take part in the learning of move-
ments is certain—but, how they do so is still not known. 
SUMMARY
 
■
A motor unit consists of a single α motor neuron and 
the skeletal muscle fibers it innervates. 
 
■
Muscle spindle afferents diverge to make synaptic 
contacts onto all the motoneurons innervating the 
muscle of origin. 
 
■
Muscular contraction begins with small motor units 
and progresses to large (the size principle of motor 
recruitment). 
 
■
The stretch reflex excites agonist muscles, and it 
inhibits antagonists through inhibitory interneurons.
 
■
The muscle spindle’s sensitivity to stretch is modulated 
by activation of γ-motoneurons (fusimotor) that cause 
the intrafusal muscle fibers to contract. 
 
■
α and γ-motor neuron co-activation continuously 
adjusts the spindle to maintain its sensitivity during 
programmed movements.
 
■
Flexor reflexes and crossed extensor reflexes initiated 
by painful stimuli comprise elements of interlimb 
coordination essential for locomotion.
 
■
Medial and lateral pools of spinal motoneurons 
innervate the muscles of the trunk and distal limbs, 
respectively.
 
■
Respiration and locomotion provide examples of motor 
programs arising from pattern generators in the central 
nervous system.
 
■
The primary motor cortex, or M1, lies anterior to the 
central sulcus and is somatotopically mapped. 
 
■
Many neurons in M1 are grouped in columns according 
to their direction selectivity.
 
■
The planning of coordinated movements includes 
anticipatory adjustments to take account of the effects 
of muscular contractions on feedback mechanisms.
 
■
The cerebellum plans and executes motor commands 
through feedback with the cortex and via descending 
commands through the red nucleus and brainstem 
nuclei. Lesions of the cerebellum disrupt coordination. 
 
■
The basal ganglia provide negative feedback to the 
cerebral cortex. The consequences of basal ganglia 
disease reflect the complex pattern of feedback loops 
that underlie their function.

■ PART VI
Development and 
Regeneration of the 
Nervous System
A question that naturally arises from reading about neuronal signaling, 
sensory perception, and motor functions concerns the way in which the 
nervous system is formed during development and how it is modified 
by experience and injury. Chapter 25 deals with the way in which the 
nervous system develops in an embryo, in terms of cellular and molecular 
mechanisms that give rise to highly complex structures. Selected examples 
are used to show how key molecules play crucial roles in the formation of 
the central and peripheral nervous systems. 
A logical question concerns the role of experience in the formation of the 
brain after an animal is born. In Chapter 26 we describe the extraordinary 
progress that has been made in understanding how visual, auditory, and 
olfactory experiences in the first months of life influence not merely the 
performance of the nervous system but its very structure. 
A related question of obvious importance concerns the ability of the 
nervous system to repair itself after injury. In Chapter 27 we show that 
nerve fibers in the periphery can regenerate to restore function after they 
have been damaged. By contrast, axons in the central nervous system are 
unable to do so, for reasons that are not yet known.


■ CHAPTER 25
Development of the 
Nervous System
D
uring development, cells acquire specific neuronal identities, and establish orderly and 
precise synaptic connections, under the influence of factors intrinsic to the cells (their 
genotype, cytoplasmic inheritance and their changing patterns of gene expression), and 
factors in the embryonic environment (inductive and trophic interactions among cells, cues that 
guide cell migration and axon outgrowth, specific cell–cell recognition, and activity-dependent 
refinement of connections). Studies on invertebrates, such as the fruit fly, have been used for 
elucidating many widely shared developmental mechanisms. In this chapter we discuss how 
vertebrate structures (e.g., the spinal cord, autonomic nervous system, and cerebral cortex) form 
and describe selected experiments to illustrate underlying mechanisms of neurodevelopment at 
the cellular and molecular level. In addition to the inherent fascination of understanding how such 
complex structures assemble, knowledge of the development of the nervous system is useful for 
the understanding and treatment of many diseases. 
The development of the vertebrate nervous system begins with the formation of the neural 
plate in the dorsal ectoderm of the early embryo. The neural plate then folds to produce the neural 
tube and the neural crest. Neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) are pro-
duced by division of precursor cells, mainly in the ventricular zone of the neural tube. Postmitotic 
neurons migrate away from the ventricular surface to form the gray matter of the adult nervous 
system. Within each region of the developing nervous system, the fates of cells become restricted 
according to anteroposterior, dorsoventral, and local patterns. The identity of a segment is deter-
mined by expression of a series of patterning genes along the anteroposterior and the dorsoven-
tral axes.
Neural crest cells form the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The phenotype adopted by a neu-
ral crest cell is determined by signals from its environment. Thus, a neural crest cell transplanted 
from one region to another early in development assumes the fate appropriate to its new location.
To reach their targets, neurons extend axons tipped with growth cones that explore the envi-
ronment. Two classes of molecules have been identified as important substrates for growth cone 
movements: (1) cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), which allow one neuron to grow along another, 
and (2) extracellular matrix molecules (ECMs), which allow adhesion of axons to a substrate. 
Growth cone navigation is controlled by long- and short-range attractive and repulsive cues. Che-
moattractants guide axons either to their ultimate synaptic partners or to an intermediate target, 
such as a guidepost cell. Chemorepellents prevent axons from entering inappropriate territories. 
Axonal projections made during development are often more extensive than those seen in the 
adult. Synapses form rapidly and are then trimmed to the adult pattern by trophic and activity-
dependent mechanisms.
A common feature of central nervous system development is an initial overproduction of neu-
rons followed by a period of cell death. Neuronal death is regulated by competition for trophic 
substances, which act alone or in combinations to sustain particular neuronal populations. 

532 Chapter 25
Development: General Considerations
The orderliness of the connections made by nerve cells with one another and with tis-
sues in the periphery is a prerequisite for normal function. To create the precise neural 
architecture of the nervous system during development, the correct numbers and types of 
neurons must be generated, assume their appropriate positions, and then make synapses 
on the proper target cells. For example, for the stretch reflex to work, the Ia afferent sensory 
neuron in a dorsal root ganglion must send one axon to end on the appropriate region of 
a muscle spindle, and another axon centrally to make synapses on those motoneurons that 
innervate the muscle that contains the spindle. Other branches of the same central axon 
end on spinal interneurons or run in the dorsal columns to innervate cells in the dorsal 
column nuclei. In addition, the number of sensory and motor neurons must be matched 
to the size of the muscle and the number of spindles it contains.
A variety of questions arise when one considers the example just described. How do 
precursor cells acquire their identities as neurons or glial cells? What cues guide neurons to 
their correct positions? Which mechanisms enable a neuron to extend an axon to a particular 
target, among myriad possible choices, and form a synapse? First of all, the assemblage of 
1010–1012 cells and an almost uncountable number of synapses is established with a very much 
smaller number of genes, only 30,000 or so, which confirms that genes act in a combinatorial 
manner to specify cell identities. Moreover, the overall wiring plan requires that flexibility be 
maintained during critical periods in development, and even in the adult, so that synapses can 
be formed, modified, or removed—for example by altered patterns of activity (see Chapter 26).
The scope of all the problems relating to development, synapse formation, neural specificity, 
and changes in efficacy is too great to be described in a single chapter (for more comprehensive 
reviews see1–3). Our aim is to provide a concise, coherent account of neural development of the 
sort that might be delivered in two or three lectures, instead of in a complete course devoted 
to the subject. There is however an inherent difficulty: how is one to present the development 
of the most complex structure in the body for readers unfamiliar with basic principles of 
embryonic development? Instead of trying to discuss all the structures as they form and all 
the responsible molecules that have been identified, we have chosen to deal with a few issues 
in development at structural, cellular, and molecular levels. After two brief asides (dealing 
with the question of how cells become different from one another at the genetic level and 
the need to describe what happens during development before one attacks the problem of 
how it happens), selected topics are discussed in developmental sequence, beginning with the 
induction of neuroectoderm and early neural morphogenesis. Then the regional specifica-
tion of neural tissue and the factors that determine the identity of individual neurons and 
glial cells are described. Finally, the mechanisms of axon outgrowth, target innervation, and 
synapse formation are considered, together with the role of growth factors and competitive 
interactions in shaping the final form of the nervous system.
Genomic Equivalence and Cell Type Diversity
The ability to clone whole animals from individual cells4,5 provides dramatic evidence that 
the cells in a developing embryo all contain the same genes. It follows that the biochemical 
differences underlying the wide variety of neurons, glia, and other cells reflect qualitative 
and quantitative differences in the activity of specific genes among the various cell types. 
These differences are achieved at many levels, ranging from transcriptional regulation (the 
extent to which specific genes are transcribed into mRNAs) to post-translation modifica-
tions (e.g., phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination) of proteins that the various genes 
encode.6–8 Which genes are transcribed in any given cell depends on what combinations 
of transcription factors are present and also on the state of the chromatin (DNA plus as-
sociated proteins). Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific regulatory DNA 
sequences associated with each gene. They may either activate or repress transcription, 
depending in part on which other transcription factors are present. 
Two major advances have led to a rapid increase in our ability to explain phenomena of 
development in terms of molecular mechanisms. First is the development of techniques to 
monitor and manipulate gene expression precisely and specifically. Second is the discovery 
that mechanisms and molecules that mediate neural development are remarkably similar

throughout the animal kingdom. For example, as mentioned in Chapter 1, the gene that 
directs the formation of the eye in a developing chick, mouse, or human is similar to that 
controlling eye formation in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster,9 and genes that function 
in patterning the developing embryo and nervous systems of flies or nematode worms 
often have homologs that function in chicks, zebrafish, and mice. This conservation of 
developmental regulatory genes across species unfortunately leads to confusion for students 
and researchers alike, because homologous genes discovered independently in different 
experimental systems receive a bewildering variety of names (Box 25.1).
Cell Fate Maps Provide a Description of Normal Development
A good starting point for many studies of development is the question of when and where the 
cells of interest arise during embryogenesis. The process of answering such questions is called 
cell fate mapping. In experimentally favorable species, one can follow patterns of prolifera-
tion, migration, and differentiation by cells that can be identified from one embryo to the 
next. For example, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains only about 300 neurons. Its 
embryo is transparent and develops rapidly, so that each cell division can be visualized under 
the microscope.10,11 For more complex embryos, including vertebrates, it is possible to mark 
individual cells early on and see what types of progeny they produce later in development. This 
approach for cell fate mapping was introduced using leech embryos; intracellular tracers, such 
as fluorescent dextran or the enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP), were micro-injected into 
individual cells whose lineages were then followed either in living embryos or after staining the 
embryos to visualize marked cells (Figure 25.1).12 Now, comparable experiments can be done 
by injecting or electroporating DNA constructs encoding fluorescent protein reporter genes 
(such as green fluorescent protein [GFP]), or by creating transgenic animals that express such 
proteins.13–16 Experiments of this kind allow one to identify the precursor cells in embryos that 
will give rise to sensory cells, interneurons, and motor cells in the CNS of the adult. 
Other approaches that have proved useful for the study of cell lineage in vertebrate central 
nervous systems include mapping the fate of genetically marked cells in embryonic and adult 
chimeras produced by surgical and microsurgical techniques, including transplantation of

on the left side). Through repeated unequal divi-
sions, the teloblasts produce columns of cells 
(bandlets) that coalesce along the ventral midline 
and form segments arise in anteroposterior pro-
gression. To establish a fate map for segmental 
tissues, including the identified neurons of the 
segmental ganglia, teloblasts can be injected 
with lineage tracers such as fluorescent dyes 
conjugated to high molecular weight dextrans 
(to prevent the tracers from diffusing through 
gap junctions). (B,C) Views of an embryo in 
which both N teloblasts had been injected 
with rhodamine-conjugated dextran (red) and

vertebrate embryos, leech segments differentiate 
in anteroposterior progression; (2) the cell fate 
distributions in each lineage are highly con-
served from segment to segment; (3) most cells 
in the ventral ganglia arise from the ventral most 
N teloblast lineages, but a few neurons in each 
segment migrate ventrally from lateral and dorsal 
lineages. (After Shain et al., 2000.)

■  BOX 25.1 
Conserved Signaling Pathways for Early Development and Neurogenesis
The signaling pathways listed here are only some of the best 
known of the many that function in neurogenesis and other 
aspects of development and physiology. The same pathways 
are used over and over again in development, often with 
different functional roles at different times and places in the 
embryos of diverse species. Often there are multiple versions 
of each pathway within a single species.
This list is far from complete—other molecules essential 
for various aspects of neurodevelopment are named as they 
appear in the text—moreover, in addition to their transcriptional 
effects, the Wnt and TGFβ pathways may also exert transcrip-
tion-independent effects, for example, by affecting the state of 
protein phosphorylation in the target cell. Other signaling mol-
ecules not in this list may act entirely at the cytoplasmic level.  
Terminology is a major problem for students interested in 
development at the molecular level. In recent years, scientists 
have identified many genes and gene products important for 
cell survival, growth, and differentiation, for axon extension 
and navigation, and for synapse formation and modification. 
These proteins and genes are named based on the history 
of their discovery and on the quirks of the investigators. The 
same molecules may receive multiple names from different 
investigators working on the same or different organisms. 
For example, transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) and 
related molecules were first identified as proteins affecting cell 
proliferation and oncogenesis in vertebrates. Another family of 
molecules called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), also 
discovered in vertebrates, turned out to be closely related to 
the TGFβs. Other vertebrate members of this TGFβ superfam-
ily in vertebrates are called inhibin, activin and Vg-1, and in 
Drosophila, two genes are named decapentaplegic and glass 
bottom boat, respectively! 
For greater detail, the student should consult comprehen-
sive books and reviews (see references1,2).
LIGAND(S)
RECEPTOR(S)
Retinoic Acid (RA)
Retinoic Acid Receptors (RARs and RXRs)
As a derivative of vitamin A (retinaldehyde), RA is a small, hydrophobic molecule that can readily diffuse across cell 
membranes. Thus, the receptors are nuclear rather than membrane proteins. In the absence of RA, RAR-RXR het-
erodimers bind to specific DNA elements and recruit other proteins that repress transcription of the target genes. 
When RA binds to the heterodimer, the  repressor is replaced by a transcriptional activator. 
Hedgehog (Hh or Sonic)
Patched-Smoothened Complex
Hedgehog is a secreted, diffusing protein that binds to a transmembrane receptor, indirectly preventing the cleav-
age of a target cytoplasmic protein called Cubitus interruptus (Ci or Gli). In the absence of Hh signaling, Ci is 
cleaved and represses transcription of its target genes. In the presence of Hh, Ci is not cleaved and activates tran-
scription of its targets.
TGFß/BMP/Activin, etc.
Receptor Serine/Threonine Kinases (RS/TKs)
Binding of the secreted, diffusing protein ligands cause one transmembrane RS/TK to phosphorylate another, which in 
term phosphorylates one of a family of cytoplasmic proteins called SMADs. The phosphorylated SMAD binds a related 
protein, and the resultant complex is transported into the nucleus to regulate the transcription of target genes.
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF), etc.
Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs)
A very large family of diffusible ligands and transmembrane receptors. Like the RS/TK receptors, ligand binding dimer-
izes the receptors. In this pathway, however, receptor activation triggers a kinase cascade, in which phosphorylation of 
one protein activates it to phosphorylate the next protein in the cascade and so on down the cascade. In addition to 
the final activation-by-phosphorylation of one or more transcription factors, the intermediate kinases in the cascade may 
also phosphorylate other cytoplasmic proteins and thus exert effects independent of any transcriptional regulation.
Wingless/Int-1 (Wnt)
Frizzled
Wnts are also a family of secreted, diffusible proteins that act indirectly by binding to a transmembrane receptor, there-
by regulating the cytoplasmic levels of a downstream target in the receiving cell. Here the key target is a protein called 
β-catenin, which also plays a structural role at the cell surface by interacting with a cell adhesion protein (cadherin). In 
the absence of Wnt signal, any free β-catenin in the cytoplasm is phosphorylated by a protein complex and thereby 
targeted for degradation. Wnt signaling indirectly inhibits the activity of the complex. Cytoplasmic β-catenin increases 
and is free to enter the nucleus to participate in the regulation of gene transcription. 
Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL)
Notch
In contrast to the other pathways, both the DSL ligands and the Notch receptor are transmembrane proteins. Thus, 
DSL–Notch signaling requires direct contact between the signaling and receiving cells. In this pathway, activation 
of the receptor by ligand enables the last of several proteolytic processing steps to occur. As a result, the notch in-
tracellular domain (NICD) is freed from the membrane and can enter the nucleus to participate in regulation of gene 
transcription.

individual cells,17,18 and infecting cells in the CNS of developing animals with specially engi-
neered viruses (Figure 25.2). For this latter purpose, viruses are constructed that will become 
permanently incorporated into the chromosomes of the host cell and replicate with them 
during mitosis.19 Thus, the information encoded by the virus is not diluted during successive 
cell divisions and a suitably encoded marker, for example GFP, can be detected at any stage. 
Provided the number of cells infected is low, one can conclude that a cluster of stained cells 
found later in development is a clone, the progeny of a single parent cell. For example, Figure 
25.2 shows the distribution of progeny cells in the adult retina after injection of a retroviral 
marker early in development.
Early Morphogenesis of the Nervous System
Early in vertebrate embryogenesis, the region of the gastrula that will give rise to the nervous 
system is a sheet of cells on the outer surface of the embryo called ectoderm (Figure 25.3). 
The ectodermal cells are under the influence of growth factors—including two proteins of 
the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) family, BMP-2 and BMP-4—that are secreted by the 
ectodermal cells themselves. Despite their name, in this context they promote the formation 
of epidermal tissue, while at the same time suppressing neural differentiation.20,21 Next, 
a cocktail of diffusible signaling proteins that block the action of BMPs is released from a

particular region of the gastrula, called the Spemann organizer in amphibian eggs, Hensen’s 
node in chick, or simply the node in mammalian embryos. This mix of BMP inhibitors in-
cludes proteins known as follistatin, noggin, and chordin.22 Once the actions of BMP have 
been blocked, signaling cascades that promote neural differentiation can proceed in cells 
near the organizer to promote neural differentiation. As a result, the neural plate is formed.
The neural plate is a sheet of elongated neuroectodermal cells from which the nervous 
system will form. The edges of the neural plate thicken to produce neural folds. The folds 
fuse at the midline to give rise to a hollow neural tube (Figure 25.4). Failure of the lips of the 
neural tube to fuse gives rise to clinical conditions known as spina bifida (in caudal spinal

cord) and anencephaly (failure of forebrain development). Some of the cells at the lips of 
the neural fold come to lie between the neural tube and the overlying ectoderm. These cells 
form the neural crest. Neural crest cells migrate away from the neural tube and give rise 
to several types of peripheral cells:  neurons and satellite cells of the sensory, sympathetic, 
and parasympathetic nervous systems; cells of the adrenal medulla; pigmented cells of the 
epidermis; and bones and connective tissue in the head.
The observations described above illustrate two key principles of neural development. 
First, cells in the node secrete factors that dramatically affect the fates of neighboring cells 
and structures. In this way, one group of cells induces changes in an adjacent group by 
secretion of a signal. Such interactions are possible in an embryo because the distances for 
diffusion are short. Second, a single molecule such as BMP can function in the development 
of different systems: bone and nervous system. These features of development will be seen 
again and again in this chapter.
Patterning along Anteroposterior and Dorsoventral Axes
A key feature of neural development is the extraordinary variety of structures that are produced. 
Understanding how one region of the kidney or liver develops provides insights about how 
the whole organ arises. This is not so for the brain, which shows dramatic regional differences 
along both the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes, and even less so for the nervous system 
as a whole. Although the basic principles are similar, different steps are needed to create an eye, 
a cerebellum, and a spinal cord. As development proceeds, the anterior (cephalic or rostral) 
portion of the neural tube undergoes a series of swellings, constrictions, and flexures that 
form anatomically defined regions of the brain (Figure 25.5). The caudal portion of the neural 
tube retains a relatively simple tubular structure and forms the spinal cord. Investigations of 
the regional specification of neural tissue in the vertebrate brain were aided immensely by 
the finding that most genes in the embryo of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster (includ-
ing many developmental regulatory genes), have vertebrate homologs (descended from the 
same gene in the ancestor of insects and vertebrates) that usually serve similar functions. One 
vertebrate preparation that offers many of the advantages of invertebrates such as Drosophila

is the zebrafish Danio rerio, which was introduced by Streisinger.23 The animal is transparent, 
and reproduces rapidly; throughout embryogenesis, individual cells can be observed under 
the microscope as they divide and grow. Mutations can be readily induced and maintained.24
Developmental regulatory genes often encode transcription factors, proteins that bind 
to DNA and thereby affect the level of expression of other genes, or components of signaling 
pathways by which cells influence one another. Development is characterized by the sequential 
and hierarchical expression of many different transcription factors at different times and in 
different parts of the embryo, often under the control of one or more signaling pathways. 
Each transcription factor influences the expression of (usually many) other genes, including 
other transcription factors. The main factor in specifying the properties of specific types of 
neurons, glia, and other cells is the particular combinations of transcription factors they express. 
Anteroposterior Patterning and Segmentation in Hindbrain
The vertebrate hindbrain and forebrain provide examples of how developing nervous sys-
tems are patterned along the anteroposterior axis. Unlike the rest of the vertebrate brain, 
the embryonic hindbrain (rhombencephalon) has a conspicuously segmented structure. 
Each segment exhibits the same general pattern of neuronal differentiation, but from seg-
ment to segment the pattern is modified in specific ways (Figure 25.6). Several genes have

been identified whose pattern of expression at early stages in development correlates with 
segmental boundaries of the hindbrain (see Figure 25.6).25 These genes fall into two catego-
ries: (1) The first consists of genes that determine the fate of each segment. Many of these 
genes belong to the highly conserved Hox family. (2) Certain genes in the second category 
establish the overall architecture of repeating segmental units. Some genes in this group 
encode transcription factors (kreisler, Krox-20); others encode receptor tyrosine kinases 
or their ligands. A receptor tyrosine kinase is a transmembrane protein whose intracellu-
lar kinase domain is activated to phosphorylate tyrosine residues on intracellular protein 
targets when a ligand binds to its extracellular domain.
Hox genes were first characterized in Drosophila as examples of homeotic genes—genes 
which, when mutated, cause one body part to be changed so as to resemble another body 
part (homeosis26; for a more recent discussion on this see also27). For example, one famous 
homeotic mutation in Drosophila called proboscipedia causes an antenna to resemble a leg. 
Studies in Drosophila revealed that several homeotic genes occur as a tandem array along 
the chromosome, reflecting ancient gene duplications. Another indication that these genes 
arose from a single ancestral gene is that they all share a 60 amino acid DNA-binding motif 
called the homeodomain, encoded by a DNA sequence called a homeobox. It turns out that 
there are many homeobox-containing transcription factor genes in the genome, most of 
which are not part of the conserved cluster of homeotic genes and which have nothing to 
do with homeosis. The term Hox gene is used to specify the genes in the original Drosophila 
cluster and their close homologs in other organisms. An intriguing discovery is that these 
arrays of Hox genes, collectively called Hox clusters, are broadly conserved among animals 
and play a key role in assigning regional identities along the anteroposterior axis. Remark-
ably, there is a co-linear relationship between the anterior boundaries of the expression 
patterns of the various Hox genes in Drosophila and their arrangement within the cluster 
along the chromosome; this co-linearity is also conserved across species.28,29 
The segmental pattern of Hox gene expression observed in the chick, zebrafish, and rodent 
hindbrain indicates that Hox genes act as patterning master genes in vertebrate development, 
and create structures appropriate to particular anteroposterior positions in the embryonic 
hindbrain. Evidence from cell transplantation, gene knockout, and gene misexpression studies 
are consistent with this idea.30–32 Additional support is provided by the finding that mutations 
of Hox and other patterning genes in humans give rise to malformations of the correspond-
ing CNS regions.33,34 The next obvious question is, what determines the pattern of Hox
gene expression? The answer is not fully known. One factor is a combination of signaling 
by retinoic acid from the paraxial mesoderm and by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) from 
a signaling center in rhombomere 4.35,36 Equally interesting is the emerging evidence that 
changes in the state of the chromatin (such as reversible, covalent modifications of the DNA 
and its associated histone proteins), spread along the chromosome in the region of the Hox 
cluster to sequentially activate and repress transcription of the Hox genes.37
Apart from the Hox proteins, two other homeodomain transcription factors, encoded 
by genes called ems (empty spiracles) and otd (orthodenticle), also regulate head segment 
development in Drosophila. Their vertebrate homologues, emx and otx, play major roles in 
the development of the forebrain. Of particular interest are the functional consequences 
of mutations in emx and otx. Mutations in emx give rise to gross defects in the structure of 
the cortex, while defects in otx give rise to epilepsy.38 The distribution of emx in developing 
mouse brain is shown in Figure 25.7. Note that the expression of the gene is restricted to 
the forebrain region and stops abruptly at its boundary with the midbrain.
Dorsoventral Patterning in the Spinal Cord
The vertebrate nervous system differentiates along the dorsoventral as well as the antero-
posterior axis. Along the ventral midline of the developing neural tube lies a band of spe-
cialized glial cells, called the floor plate (see below). Adjacent, basal regions of the neural 
tube give rise to motoneurons, more dorsal alar regions give rise to interneurons, and the 
region that is the most dorsal forms the roof plate and the neural crest. 
The specializations in ventral territory depend in large part on a signaling protein 
known as Sonic hedgehog.39 Sonic hedgehog is initially produced and secreted by cells of 
the notochord, just ventral to the neural tube. Cells at the ventral portion of the neural tube

experience higher levels of Sonic hedgehog protein than those elsewhere and are induced 
to become floor plate cells, which then  make and  secrete Sonic hedgehog on their own.40
As a result, a ventrodorsal gradient of Sonic hedgehog is established in the neural tube with 
highest concentrations in the ventral regions. Within the neural tube, cells experiencing 
different levels of Sonic hedgehog protein are induced to express different homeodomain 
transcription factors, and these in turn specify the differentiation of different classes of cells 
along the ventrodorsal extent of the spinal cord.41,42 Thus, an extra notochord produces an 
extra floor plate (Figure 25.8A and B), and in the absence of a notochord, the floor plate 
and the motoneurons, which require the highest levels of Sonic hedgehog, fail to develop 
(Figure 25.8C and D).43
In parallel to the establishment of the ventrodorsal gradient of Sonic hedgehog emanat-
ing from the floor plate cells, other processes in early development lead to the formation of 
roof plate cells at the dorsal side of the neural tube. The roof plate generates dorsoventral 
gradients of BMP and Wnt proteins.44 The dorsoventral gradient determines the differentia-
tion of dorsal, (i.e., sensory), regions of developing spinal cord. (For detailed information 
about the Sonic hedgehog, Wnt and BMP signaling pathways see refs.37,42,45)
The examples of hindbrain segmentation and neural tube patterning illustrate a 
general principle: different combinations of cues (often secreted signaling molecules) 
along the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes of the embryo specify cells to assume 
specific fates appropriate to their locations (Figure 25.9). Specialized differentiation is 
achieved through the expression of particular combinations of transcription factors, which 
determine regional identity throughout the CNS.46 Hence, any one factor can induce quite 
different effects, depending on where in the embryo it is expressed. For example, Sonic 
hedgehog induces the production of motor neurons in the spinal cord, but gives rise to 
serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in the hindbrain, and oculomotor neurons in 
the anterior midbrain.47,48

Cell Proliferation 
The cerebral cortex contains billions of neurons and glial cells, organized into multiple 
layers as described in Chapter 3. In the following sections we describe important features 
for the development of the cortex, namely cell proliferation and migration.49
Cell Proliferation in the Ventricular Zone
One technique to determine where and when a cell was born is to introduce an analog of 
thymidine (such as tritiated thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine—BrdU) transiently into the 
live embryo.50,51 The molecule is incorporated into the DNA (not RNA) only of cells that 
were in the DNA synthesis phase (S phase) of the cell cycle at the time of exposure. Thus, by 
examining tissues soon after the injection, it is possible to detect the label and to determine 
where and when cell divisions are taking place; and that information, combined with ob-
servations made at later times after the injection (see below), permits one to infer how the 
labeled cells have migrated.52,53 Figure 25.10 illustrates the reconstructed sequence of events 
as neurons and glial cells are generated. The wall of the neural tube is initially composed of 
a single, rapidly dividing layer of cells; each cell extends a process from the luminal, or ven-
tricular, edge to the external, or pial, surface (Figure 25.10A). As a cell progresses through the 
cell cycle, its nucleus moves back and forth through its cytoplasm between the ventricular 
and pial surfaces, a process known as interkinetic nuclear migration. Once the nucleus arrives 
back at the ventricular surface, the pial connection is lost and the cell divides. The two daugh-
ter cells may then go through further cycles of division. Alternatively, one (or both) of the 
daughter cells may migrate away from the ventricular zone to assume a neuronal or glial fate.
Most cells destined to become neurons are postmitotic, meaning they do not divide 
again (but see below). Glial cell precursors, on the other hand, can divide even after they have 
reached their final locations. As more and more postmitotic cells are produced, proliferation 
slows and the neural tube thickens, assuming a three-layered configuration: an innermost 
ventricular zone (where proliferation continues), an intermediate mantle zone containing 
the cell bodies of the migrating neurons, and a superficial marginal zone composed of the 
elongating axons of the underlying neurons (Figure 25.10B). This three-layered structure 
persists in the spinal cord and medulla. In other regions, such as the cerebrum, neurons 
migrate toward the pial surface into the marginal zone to form a cortical plate, which 
matures into the adult cortex (Figure 25.10C and D, and see below).
Cell Proliferation via Radial Glia
Another mechanism by which neurons are generated in the developing cortex involves the 
participation of glial cells. As the three-layered configuration of the neural tube takes shape,

expression. (B) Subsequently, dorsoventral position is encoded by 
gradients of midline signals, such as Sonic hedgehog and bone 
morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4/7. (C) The resulting two-dimensional 
coordinate system of positional information restricts the repertoire of 
cell fates available to pluripotent precursor cells. (After Simon,

the majority of the ventricular zone cells lose the processes that originally reached to the 
pial surface. But a sub-class of cells known as radial glia (identified by their expression of 
specific molecular markers, see Chapter 10) maintain processes that extend through the 
thickness of developing cortex from ventricular to marginal zones. Kriegstein and his col-
leagues have shown that radial glial cells produce neuronal precursors.54 Thus, cells destined 
to be neurons bud off from immature radial glia (Figure 25.11). (Radial glial cells should 
not be confused with the cytoplasmic processes of neuronal precursors shown in Figure

25.10). Cells that resemble radial glia also give rise to neurons in human cerebral cortices 
obtained from embryos postmortem.55
In mature mammalian CNS, radial glial cells (with certain exceptions, such those in 
retina and cerebellum) become transformed into astrocytes. In non-mammalian vertebrates, 
however, radial glial cells remain abundant into adulthood. This difference correlates 
with dramatic differences in the capacity for adult cortical neurogenesis (see below) and 
regeneration between mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates (see Chapter 26).56
When Do Neurons Stop Dividing? Adult Neurogenesis
Unlike glial cells, the vast majority of neurons formed during development never divide 
again in the mature animal. Nevertheless, pluripotent stem cells can give rise to neurons,57
and new neurons are continuously added to the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and olfac-
tory mucosa in some species of adult mammals.58 It appears that these new cells arise from 
so-called self-renewing neural stem cells that have been isolated not only from the walls of 
the ventricles but also from the hippocampus of the adult brain.59,60 Such cells can generate 
neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes (and even vascular endothelial cells61). Neurons 
that are continuously added to the olfactory bulb in vivo arise from slowly dividing stem 
cells in the innermost ependymal layer of the walls of the lateral ventricles (the vestige of 
the original ventricular zone).62 After each division, one of the resulting cells enters the 
subependymal zone to become a progenitor cell. The progenitor cell divides, forming im-
mature neurons that migrate rostrally into the bulb, where they differentiate as interneu-
rons and integrate into the existing circuitry. Hopes have been expressed that stem cells 
could eventually be harvested to generate neurons or glia for treatment of nervous system 
diseases or spinal cord lesions.
In songbirds, Nottebohm and his colleagues have demonstrated that proliferation of 
important sets of neurons occurs throughout adult life. In canaries, a brain region known as 
the high vocal center (HVC) nucleus plays a crucial role in the acquisition and retention of

development (left) during which neurons arise primarily from neuroepithelial cells undergoing inter-
kinetic nuclear migration (brown cells, left), additional cells are produced by radial glia (light blue 
cells, center). Clonal analysis reveals that some neurons arise as the direct descendants of radial 
glia. In other cases, the immediate progeny of the radial glia acts as a neuron intermediate pro-
genitor cell (nIPC), which undergoes additional rounds of division. In mammals, most of the radial 
glia eventually differentiates into astrocytes (right). CP = cortical plate; IZ = intermediate zone; MZ

song—a uniquely male behavior.63,64 This area of the brain is under hormonal control and is 
more developed in males than in females (Figure 25.12). The recruitment of newborn neurons 
to the HVC in males peaks in the fall and spring following periods of neuronal death. This 
recruitment period is just when males modify their song for the next breeding season. The 
period of neuronal death coincides with a drop in testosterone levels, and recruitment peaks 
when testosterone levels rise. Administration of testosterone to females causes an increase 
in the recruitment of new HVC neurons and induces the females to sing. The HVC nucleus 
and other structures associated with song production become enlarged in such androgenized 
females. New HVC neurons in males and females receive appropriate synaptic input and 
project axons to the proper targets. These remarkable observations indicate not only that new 
neurons arise in the adult songbird brain, but also that they can be assimilated into complex 
circuits so as to provide the substrate for the remodeling of a behavior as intricate as birdsong.
In light of the results showing that neurons are added to adult mammalian hippocampus,65
a question that arises is whether new neurons are also added to the adult human cerebral 
cortex. Evidence that new cortical neurons do arise in rodents and even in monkeys gave rise 
to widely publicized speculation about the possible functions of newly born neurons in adult 
human cerebral cortex, but the basic observations were subsequently called into question.66,67
An innovative and decisive approach to this problem was undertaken in two sets of experi-
ments.68,69 In the first set of experiments (Figure 25.13), Bhardwaj and colleagues made use 
of the fact that 14C incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells during replication persists for 
the life of the cells. During the nuclear weapons tests of 1955–1963, 14C in the environment 
increased sharply and was incorporated into the food supply. Consequently, one would expect 
to find elevated levels of 14C in cortical neurons of people born during that time. Measurement 
of 14C cortical labeling made by accelerator mass spectroscopy in human brains obtained 
postmortem showed that this was the case. But after the test ban treaty of 1963, levels of 14C 
in the environment fell sharply. (Note that this rapid decline reflects dilution through the 
biogeochemical carbon cycle, not radioactive decay—the radioactive half life of 14C is > 5000 
years.) Thus, if new (unlabeled) cortical cells were to be produced in adulthood, one would 
expect the levels of cortical 14C to decline year by year in people born during 1955–1963. 
Indeed, this was the case for glial cells and for the endothelial cells in blood vessels, as a result 
of the replacement of original 14C-labeled cells by cells with progressively lower 14C levels. 
No such decline was found in the neurons, however, as levels of 14C in the cortical neurons 
of adults born before 1963 remained high throughout their lives. This showed that few if any 
new neurons had been produced in the adult cortex. 
A second series of quite different experiments produced a similar result. Terminal 
patients afflicted with localized carcinomata, with no spread to the brain and no medica-
tion that could affect the cortex, volunteered to have bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injected 
into the ventricle. As mentioned above, BrdU is incorporated into the DNA of a cell while 
it is replicating its DNA in preparation for mitosis, but not in mature, postmitotic cells, 
and can be detected by antibody labeling. On postmortem examination, it was found that 
glial cells and endothelial cells of the volunteers were labeled, but neurons were not. Thus, 
rather few new neurons are produced in adult human cortex, unlike other regions such as 
hippocampus or in the cortex of a rodent.

Migration
Migration of Cortical Neurons
A cortical neuronal precursor that has undergone its final division migrates through the 
thickness of the developing CNS to reach its final destination.70 As mentioned previously, 
migration through the cortex can be studied by applying a pulse of 3H thymidine or BrdU 
on a particular day during development to mark cells undergoing DNA synthesis at that 
time. Postmitotic cells are not labeled, and in cells that continue to divide after the pulse, 
the label will be diluted during subsequent rounds of DNA synthesis and cell division. 
However, any cells that undergo their final round of DNA synthesis and then become born, 
so to speak, as postmitotic neurons during the pulse will remain heavily labeled. Thus, the 
fate of neurons born on a particular day can be determined by exposing an embryo to a 
pulse of label on that day, and then determining the locations of the labeled cells at a later 
date by autoradiography or immunohistochemistry.50
Such experiments reveal a systematic relationship between the time a neuron is born 
and its final position in the developing cerebral cortex; characteristically, development 
proceeds in an inside-out fashion.52 Neurons of the deepest cortical layers are born first. 
Neurons that occupy layers that are more superficial are born later and migrate past the 
cells of the deeper layers to assume their final positions within the cortex. These neuronal 
precursors migrate through the cortex along radial glial cells (see Figure 25.10). As the 
walls of the neural tube thicken, through the continued division of cells in the ventricular 
layer and the accumulation of neurons in the mantle zone and cortical plate, the processes 
of the radial glial cells become elongated. From light- and electron-microscopic studies of 
the development of the cerebrum and cerebellum, Rakic and his colleagues71 deduced that 
neurons move along this scaffolding of radial glial cells to reach their appropriate posi-
tions in the cortex (Figure 25.14). Observations in mutant mice and on cells maintained 
in culture72 support this conclusion. The proteins mediating such neuronal migration 
include a neural glycoprotein, known as astrotactin,73,74 and extracellular matrix adhesion 
molecules (discussed later). The cell biological mechanisms underlying cell migration

Cerebral Cortex. 14C radioactivity was measured in cell nuclei of 
neurons and non-neuronal cells in human cortex in relation to the time 
of birth. (A) Neuronal (NeuN-positive, red) and nonneuronal (NeuN-
negative, green) cell nuclei from the adult human cerebral necortex 
were identified, separated, and isolated by flow cytometry. (B) In 
1955–1963 the levels of 14C in the atmosphere increased dramatically 
as a result of nuclear weapons tests and subsequently declined (blue 
line). One can infer the time of birth of cell populations by first relating 
the level of 14C in their DNA to that in the atmosphere (guidelines from 
A to B), and then reading their age off the x axis (vertical arrows). The 
age of the individual is given by the dashed line. The average age of 
all cells in the prefrontal cortex is less than the individual (black circle 
and arrow), indicating cell turnover. Dating of nonneuronal cells (green 
circle and arrow) indicates that they are younger, whereas neurons 
(red circle and arrow) are approximately as old as the individual. 
These results and others (see text) indicate that glial and endothelial 
cells continue to divide while cortical neurons did not. FSC-A = for-

and axon outgrowth (see below) are similar.75 Both depend primarily on the actin-based 
microfilament cytoskeleton.
Neurons can also migrate without crawling along radial glial cells. For example, the 
formation of the cerebral cortex involves tangential migration of large numbers of neurons, 
(especially GABA-secreting stellate cells), laterally from one cortical region into neighboring 
areas during development.76,77
Another remarkable example of migration without radial glia is provided by a population 
of neurons expressing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). These precursors migrate 
from the periphery into the CNS (see also Chapter 17).78 The GnRH cells travel from the 
olfactory pit (an ectodermal derivative, or placode, that gives rise to the nasal epithelium), 
into the hypothalamus along a previously established axon tract. Patients suffering from

a condition known as Kallmann’s syndrome, (a genetic disorder of the olfactory placode) 
display a defective sense of smell and also sterility.79,80 The cause is a failure of migration 
of olfactory precursors and GnRH cells to their destinations within the hypothalamus. 
Genetic Abnormalities of Cortical Layers in Reeler Mice 
The mutant mouse reeler (so called because of the uneven gait it displays) demonstrates 
how a neuron’s final position can be determined by an extracellular signal. In the devel-
oping cortex of reeler mice, neurons fail to migrate past one another.81 Therefore, their 
relative positions in the adult are inverted: neurons born at early times end up in the most 
superficial layers, whereas those born later end up in deeper layers. In spite of their aber-
rant positions, the misplaced neurons acquire the morphological appearance and make 
connections appropriate to their time of birth. Thus, the morphology of cortical neurons 
and the nature of their synaptic interactions are determined at the time the neuron is born 
and can be expressed independently of position. The reeler phenotype results from multiple 
consequences of the mutation in the cortex and elsewhere in the brain. The product of the 
reeler gene is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein called reelin.82,83 It is expressed in 
Cajal–Retzius cells that are situated superficially in the marginal zone of the cortex (see 
Figure 25.14).84 There is evidence that reelin produced by these superficial cells provides a 
signal that stops migration (“All passengers, step down from the radial glia here, please”); 
at the same time, it is clear that reelin also has other functions.85
Determination of Cell Phenotype
The following paragraphs deal with the sequence of steps that establish the properties of 
a cell, that is, its phenotype, once it has reached its final destination. Which precursor cells 
and what mechanisms determine whether it will be a neuron or a glial cell? For a neuron, 
what factors determine its transmitter and the receptors on its surface? It will be shown 
that inductive interactions between cells (extrinsic factors), as well as the lineage from 
which the cells arise (intrinsic factors) are important for determining the fates of neurons.
Lineage of Neurons and Glial Cells
To determine which precursor cells give rise to glial cells or different types of neurons, experi-
ments were done in which a virus was injected into the eye of a newborn rat. After the animal 
had reached adulthood, the retina contained clusters of stained cells that frequently included 
both glial cells and several types of neurons.86 Thus, a single progenitor cell in the retina at the 
time of birth had given rise to both neurons and glial cells (see Figure 25.2), and the rodent 
retina shows no evidence for specific lineages that give rise to particular types of neurons.
Extensive work shows that the various cell types in the highly regular insect eye also 
arise by indeterminate lineages (see Chapter 18).87,88 Rather, progenitor cells respond to 
external cues. Both the cues present in the environment and the intrinsic ability of the cells 
to respond change with time, generating a succession of different cell types.89,90
By contrast, when similar experiments were made in cerebral cortex, clones containing 
both neurons and glial cells were rare, suggesting that at the time of viral infection separate 
populations of progenitors for neurons and glial cells were already present in the cortical 
ventricular zone. Moreover, clones tended to contain exclusively pyramidal cells or non-
pyramidal cells, suggesting that these lineages diverge early in neurogenesis.91 In a general 
sense, this result also parallels studies of the ventral nerve cord (as opposed to the eye) in 
simpler systems, such as leeches and insects, in which individually identified neurons have 
been shown to arise by highly stereotyped lineages.92–94
Control of Transmitter Choice in the Peripheral Nervous System
In the peripheral nervous system, cell lineage, neuronal birthday, and local cues all affect 
the fate of sympathetic neurons, including the decision to secrete a particular transmitter, 
for example acetylcholine (ACh) or norepinephrine. Such questions have been studied in 
chick and quail by Le Douarin, Weston, and others.95–97

Neural crest cells at different positions along the neuraxis give rise to different cell types 
of the peripheral nervous system (Figure 25.15A). To investigate whether the phenotype of 
cells derived from the neural crest was fixed early in development or could be altered at a later 
date, Le Douarin and her colleagues transplanted cells from quail embryos into host chick 
embryos (Figure 25.15B). The transplanted cells could then be recognized by cytological 
differences between quail and chick cells. When donor cells from one region of the neural 
crest were transplanted to a different region of a host embryo the donor cells assumed the 
fate appropriate to their new position in the host. For example, the normal destiny of a cell 
situated in segment 12 is to become a sympathetic ganglion cell and secrete norepinephrine 
as its transmitter. When transplanted to a region of segments 18–24, however, cells from 
segment 12 became chromaffin cells and secreted epinephrine. 
Changes in the choice of neurotransmitter also occur during normal development. For 
example, sympathetic neurons that innervate sweat glands initially synthesize norepinephrine, 
but during the second and third weeks of life they are induced to synthesize acetylcholine by 
factors associated with their target.98 Sympathetic ganglion cells in culture have been used 
to explore the mechanism by which neurotransmitters are switched. Neurons dissociated 
from the superior cervical ganglia of newborn rats and grown in culture in the absence of 
other cell types, contain tyrosine hydroxylase and synthesize catecholamines.99 However, 
neurons that are grown together with heart muscle cells or sweat glands cease synthesiz-
ing catecholamines and begin synthesizing choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholine.

ral crest cells give rise to a variety of peripheral ganglia. The ciliary ganglion is formed by migrating 
cells from the mesencephalic neural crest (beige triangle). The ganglion of Remak and the enteric 
ganglia of the gut are formed by cells from the vagal (somites 1–7) and lumbosacral (caudal to 
S28) regions of the neural crest. The ganglia of the sympathetic chain are derived from all regions 
of the neural crest caudal to S5. The adrenal medulla is populated by crest cells from S18–S24. 
(B) If crest cells from S18–S24, which are destined to form the adrenal medulla, are transplanted 
from a quail donor to the vagal or lumbosacral region of a host chick embryo, they will adopt the 
fate appropriate to their new location and populate the ganglion of Remak and the enteric ganglia 
of the gut. (After Le Douarin, 1986.)

To establish unequivocally that this change occurs in individual cells, single neurons were 
cultured on micro-islands of heart cells (Figure 25.16).100 The neuron rapidly extended 
neurites and established synaptic contact with the heart cells. Initially, these synapses were 
purely adrenergic, but over several days the cell began to release both ACh and norepi-
nephrine. Finally, transmission became purely cholinergic. A factor that induces cholinergic 
differentiation of sympathetic neurons was identified from heart-conditioned medium.101
The active molecule proved to be leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a protein that had been 
characterized previously on the basis of its ability to induce differentiation of cells in the 
immune system. There is evidence that LIF, together with related molecules, mediates the 
switch in transmitter from norephinephrine to acetylcholine in the sympathetic neurons 
that innervate sweat glands in vivo.102
Changes in Receptors during Development
In addition to switching transmitters, cells may also change their expression of receptors 
during development. One example (already mentioned in Chapter 5) is provided by the 
nicotinic ACh receptors (made up of 5 subunits, ααβγδ) that are distributed over the 
surface of immature muscle fibers. Arrival of the motor nerve induces clustering of ACh 
receptors at the motor end plate and a change in their subunit composition: the γ-subunit 
is replaced by an ε. This switch to a new protein entails a change in transcription induced 
by arrival of the motor nerve (see also Chapter 27).
Another way of bringing about a developmental change in receptor function is a process 
called RNA editing. This phenomenon is exemplified by the class of excitatory glutamate 
receptors known as α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) 
receptors (see Chapter 11). There are four AMPA receptor genes (GluA1 through GluA4), 
each of which codes for an asparagine residue at a critical site in the loop that contributes 
to the ion channel. When AMPA receptors  are assembled entirely from GluA subunits 
encoded by unediteds mRNAs, they show significant calcium permeability.103 However, 
beginning during embryonic development and continuing into adulthood, an RNA editing 
enzyme, called adenosine deaminase (ADA) on RNA (ADAR2), modifies the GluA2 mRNA 
so that it is translated with an arginine residue instead of asparagine at the critical site.104,105
Moreover, the presence of even one such asparagine-to-arginine-edited GluA subunit drasti-
cally reduces the calcium permeability of the receptor complex.102 Curiously, it is not clear 
that the unedited version of the receptor is required during embryogenesis—mice that are 
genetically engineered to express a pre-edited version of GluR2 subunit developed with no 
obvious defects.106 On the other hand, editing the GluA2 to encode a calcium-impermeant 
channel is essential, as deficient editing of GLuA2 is associated with postnatal lethality, 
early-onset epilepsy, and motoneuron death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).107,108
Changes in transmitter action also occur during development without changes in receptors 
or transmitters. Cherubini and his colleagues109,110 have shown that at early postnatal stages 
GABA secreted by hippocampal interneurons acts as an excitatory transmitter. Only at about

12 days in rats does GABA cause hyperpolarization and inhibition as in the adult (Figure 
25.17). In this case, neither the receptors nor the transmitter change. Instead, the critical 
difference is that the intracellular chloride level is higher in immature postsynaptic neurons 
than in mature neurons, owing to the presence of an inwardly directed chloride transporter 
NKCC1 in the immature neurons (see Chapter 9).111 With high intracellular Cl–, opening 
GABA-gated channels leads to outward movement of Cl– and depolarization of the cell. Later 
in development, NKCC1 in these neurons is replaced by an outward chloride transporter, 
KCC2. As a result, intracellular Cl– become lower inside the cell and the hyperpolarizing 
response to GABA appears. There is evidence that excitation and firing produced by GABA 
plays a part in the formation of connections while circuits are being established.112
Axon Outgrowth and Growth Cone Navigation
Growth Cones, Axon Elongation, and the Role of Actin
Ramón y Cajal was the first to recognize the growth cone as the region of an axon responsible 
for navigation and elongation toward a target (Figure 25.18). Growth cones are situated at 
the tips of axons; they extend and retract broad membranous sheets, called lamellipodia, and 
slender, spike-like protrusions, termed filopodia, for distances of tens of micrometers, as if 
sampling the substrate in every direction.113–115 Filopodia may adhere to the substrate, in 
which case the retraction serves to pull the growth cone in that direction. Dynamics of the 
actin cytoskeleton (i.e., polymerization, depolymerization, and interactions with non-muscle 
myosins) are responsible for producing protrusion and retraction of lamellipodia and filopo-
dia as well as for the forward movement of the body of the growth cone (Figure 25.19). Both 
lamellipodia and filopodia are rich in filamentous actin; agents that inhibit actin polymeriza-
tion, such as the fungal toxin cytochalasin B, immobilize growth cones. Much information 
is now available about mechanisms of neurite outgrowth. As we have seen for transmitter 
release (see Chapter 13) and for many other cellular processes, transient, localized increases 
in cytoplasmic calcium levels are important in regulating events in the growth cone.116,117

Development. Two days after birth, 
CA3 neurons in the rat hippocampus 
are depolarized by GABA and by in-
hibitory synaptic inputs. At early stages, 
the opening of chloride channels by 
γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) allows the 
negatively charged ion to exit. By 12 
days, the effect of GABA and inhibitory 
inputs have reversed and, as in the adult, 
give rise to hyperpolarization (inward 
movement of Cl–) at the normal resting 
potential. The change to hyperpolariza-
tion is caused by a decrease in intracel-
lular chloride concentration. At 2 days, 
the concentration is high owing to the 
activity of an inward chloride transporter 
(NKCC1), which virtually disappears by 
day 12. (After Cherubini, Gaiarsa, and

cells promotes their aggregation, the extension of axons (on cellular but not extracellular 
matrix substrates), and the binding together of growing axons into fascicles.
Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules, for example laminin, fibronectin, 
tenascin, cytotactin, and perlecan, are glycoproteins secreted by glial and mesodermal cells 
during development and by Schwann cells in adult peripheral nervous system. ECM proteins 
also provide favorable substrates for neurite extension.121 For example, a leech neuron that 
grows only a few microns when plated on plastic can extend processes over hundreds of 
microns on a dish coated with laminin.122 ECM molecules interact with cells via a family 
of receptors known as integrins, which span the membrane to link ECM proteins and the 
intracellular actin cytoskeleton, and thereby regulate cell shape and migration. In addition, 
the activation of integrin receptors by ECM activates intracellular signaling pathways that 
control cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation.123 
Antibody perturbation studies indicate that growth cones rarely rely on a single substrate 
to support their movements; several species of cell and ECM adhesion molecules may affect 
neurite outgrowth within a particular molecular ecosystem of the embryo. Cues that support 
the growth of one type of migrating cell or growth cone may be ignored or avoided by others.124
Growth Cone Guidance: Target-Dependent and 
Target-Independent Navigation
The axon of a cell can extend up to a meter or more (far more in a giraffe or a whale) to 
form synapses on appropriate cells in a region that contains many potential targets. Dur-
ing development, cues in the environment of an axon guide it along specific pathways. 
How do extracellular cues guide growth cones?125 Ramón y Cajal originally proposed a 
chemoattractant model of axon guidance. According to this model, the growth cone navigates 
along a gradient of molecules released by its target. This can account for directed axon 
outgrowth when the distance from the nerve cell body to its target is short. For example, 
Lumsden and Davies126 studied the growth of axons from the trigeminal ganglion in the 
head of the mouse into the adjacent epithelial tissue, a distance of less than 1 millimeter. 
(These axons ultimately give rise to the sensory innervation of the whiskers; see Chapter 
21.) If the developing trigeminal ganglion is placed in culture near explants from several 
peripheral tissues, neurites grow from the ganglion toward their appropriate target, ignoring 
other tissues. Explants of target epithelium have this effect on axon outgrowth only if they 
are taken from embryos at the stage when innervation normally occurs.
In contrast, the ability of spinal motor axons to grow to the appropriate region in the limb 
does not depend on the presence of their target muscles. This was shown by removing the 
tissues that give rise to limb musculature, early in development.124,127 Motor axons extended 
normally from the spinal cord, grew into the limb, and formed the appropriate pattern of muscle 
nerves—all in the absence of muscle. Thus, the factors that guide motor axons to their correct 
destinations in the limb are not supplied by the muscles that the axons ultimately innervate.
Target-Dependent Navigation via Guidepost Cells
When the distance from a neuron to its target is more than several hundred microns, the 
pathway may be marked with intermediate targets. For example, growth cones arising from 
sensory cells in the limbs of developing grasshoppers make abrupt changes in direction as 
they extend toward the CNS (Figure 25.20). The turns occur when the growth cones contact 
so-called guidepost cells.128,129 Such behavior suggests that interactions with guidepost cells, 
which are often immature neurons, are responsible for redirecting the growth cones. This 
phenomenon can be demonstrated by removing the guidepost cells by laser ablation before 
the growth cone arrives, in which case the appropriate change in trajectory is not made.
Synaptic interactions can occur with guidepost cells. For example, axons arising from 
the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the mammalian visual system reach the developing 
cortical plate before their synaptic targets (i.e., the pyramidal cells of layer 4) have been 
born. The geniculate axons form synaptic connections with the subplate neurons, which 
are produced early, lie beneath the developing cortical plate, and disappear shortly after 
birth.130,131 After a few weeks, when layer 4 pyramidal cells have reached their position in 
the cortex, geniculate axons abandon their connections with subplate neurons and invade

nated early in development by local application of neurotoxins, LGN axons grow past the 
developing visual cortex, and ocular dominance columns fail to form.132
Growth Cone Navigation along Gradients
Studies of growth cone behavior in cell culture indicate that cell and extracellular matrix 
adhesion molecules do not provide long-range guidance cues. For example, growth cones 
neither extend up or down gradients of cell and matrix adhesion molecules, nor do they 
navigate using differences in the strength of adhesion of different surfaces. Adhesive mol-
ecules are either permissive for growth or not.133,134 Instead, long-range guidance involves 
growth cone navigation along gradients of diffusible factors.
A good example of mechanisms and molecules that guide growth cones to their targets 
is provided by commissural interneurons in the vertebrate spinal cord. Early in development 
these sensory interneurons, which lie in the dorsal part of the spinal cord, extend axons 
that grow ventrally cross the midline, and then run longitudinally along the spinal cord 
toward their targets in the brainstem and thalamus (see Chapter 21).135
Axons of such commissural interneurons are initially attracted to the ventral midline 
by the protein netrin-1, a diffusible chemoattractant released by the floor plate cells  that 
form the ventral midline of the nerve cord (Figure 25.21A).136,137 Netrin-1 is a member of

a family of secreted proteins characterized by domains homologous to the amino-terminal 
domains of the γ chain of laminin-1.136,138 Homologues of netrin, which can be repulsive 
as well as attractant under various circumstances, are also involved in axon guidance in 
Drosophila and in C. elegans, where it was first discovered and named unc-6.139 The dor-
soventral concentration gradient of netrin-1 attracts growing axons by interacting with a 
receptor expressed on them, which as mentioned above is called Deleted in Colon Cancer 
(DCC) and is a cell adhesion molecule. 
The existence of a chemoattractant produced by the floor plate was demonstrated by 
culturing explants of dorsal spinal cord either alone or with pieces of floor plate. As shown 
in Figure 25.22, axons of commissural neurons specifically grew toward the floor plate, 
even when the tissues were separated by several hundred microns. This distance is too great 
to be spanned by a filopodium from a growth cone. Commissural neurons were similarly 
attracted to cell aggregates that secreted netrin-1 (see Figure 25.22, middle panel) but not 
to non-secreting control cells (right panel).
After being attracted in the direction of the floor plate, the commissural axon growth 
cones cross the ventral midline to the contralateral side (Figure 25.21B and C). Crossing is 
facilitated by the interaction of two cell surface-adhesive molecules: TAG-1, which is expressed 
on the surface of commissural axons, and NrCAM, expressed on the floor plate cells. As the 
axons cross, they receive signals from floor plate cells to stop synthesizing TAG-1 and start 
synthesizing a protein called roundabout (robo).137,138 Robo is the receptor for another 
protein, called slit, which is also released by floor plate cells. The slit–robo interaction repels 
commissural interneuron growth cones. The loss of the TAG-1–NrCAM contact attraction 
and the acquisition of slit–robo short-range repulsion prevent commissural axons from 
re-crossing the midline. (The gene name Robo comes from the mutation in Drosophila 
that knocks out the function of this receptor. In mutant embryos, the repulsive signal is 
lost and the growth cones in the developing nerve cord cross and re-cross the midline. 
The thickened commissural nerves come to resemble a traffic circle or round-about.140) 
Netrin-1, while attracting commissural neuron growth cones, acts in concert with slit to 
repel growth cones of motoneurons. These long-range repulsive interactions direct motor 
axons away from the cord toward the periphery (Figure 25.21D).141
Another family of proteins that act primarily as chemorepellents is the semaphorins.142
Originally identified and implicated in axon guidance in grasshoppers, semaphorins were 
recognized as chemorepellents when a vertebrate homologue, collapsin-1, was purified and 
shown to cause retraction or collapse of growth cones in cell culture and to mediate long-
range repulsion of axons in explant cultures. Neuropilins are highly conserved receptors for

Growth Factors and Survival of Neurons
Cell Death in the Developing Nervous System
A conspicuous feature of the nervous system development is that many cells are born to 
die. In invertebrates, for example, the sweeping changes that occur during metamorphosis 
include the programmed cell death (apoptosis) of many neurons.145 However, in developing 
invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems, cell death also occurs in the absence of such 
gross morphological changes.146 Overproduction of neurons followed by a period of cell 
death is a common pattern throughout development. Some of the neurons that die may not 
have made any synapses or may have innervated an inappropriate target. Most, however, 
appear to have reached and innervated their correct targets. An important finding was that 
inhibitors of mRNA or protein synthesis prevented the normal death of neurons.147 Thus, 
apoptosis is a process that activates intrinsic suicide machinery in a cell. DNA and proteins 
within the cell break down as a result of synthesis or activation of families of proteolytic 
enzymes called caspases.148
The extent of neuronal apoptosis in vertebrate embryos depends on the size of the 
target tissue.149 Hamburger and his colleagues showed that when synaptic connections 
were first being formed on myofibers in developing limbs, 40% to 70% of the motoneurons 
that had sent axons into the limb died. Implantation of a supernumerary limb reduced the 
fraction of motoneurons that died, while removal of the limb bud exacerbated the death of 
motoneurons. These results suggested that motoneurons were competing for some trophic 
substance supplied by their target tissue. 
In addition to cell death, another process, called synaptic reorganization, refines the pat-
tern of innervation after axons reach their targets and make synaptic connections. Synaptic 
reorganization entails a reduction in the number of axons and synapses, accompanied by 
a reorganization of surviving connections, to achieve the adult pattern. As is true for cell 
death, synaptic reorganization also involves competition for limited supplies of trophic 
factors, such as those described in the following sections.
Nerve Growth Factor
The first trophic substance to be identified was nerve growth factor (NGF), acting on sen-
sory and sympathetic neurons. In pioneering experiments, Levi-Montalcini, Cohen, and 
their colleagues first demonstrated that NGF stimulated the outgrowth of neurites neurons 
in culture.150 They went on to show that NGF was also required for neuronal survival. 
When the action of NGF was blocked with antibodies in newborn mice, almost all of the 
sympathetic neurons died. The parasympathetic nervous system was not affected, and the 
dorsal root ganglia were only slightly smaller than normal. In subsequent experiments, 
it was shown that at an earlier, fetal stage in development, dorsal root ganglion sensory 
neurons likewise required NGF for survival. In adults, antibodies to NGF were much less 
effective on either cell population, even though NGF was still required for survival.151–153
These observations set the stage for a molecular analysis of the mechanism of action of 
nerve growth factor by a number of research groups, including those of Levi-Montalcini, 
Shooter,154 and Barde.155 Their studies revealed the characteristics of NGF, the receptors 
to which it binds, and the subsequent metabolic events.
The fact that NGF is required for cell survival suggests that it acts either directly or 
indirectly on the cell body. When embryonic sympathetic neurons are grown in three-
compartment culture chambers (Figure 25.23), the central compartment in which the 
neurons are placed must initially contain NGF for the cells to survive (Figure 25.23A).156
However, after neurites have reached the side compartments, NGF can be removed from 
the central compartment and the cells will remain alive, so long as the side compartments 
contain NGF (Figure 25.23B). Removal of NGF from one side compartment causes neurites 
on that side to degenerate (Figure 25.23C). These results indicate that the trophic effects 
of NGF are mediated by signals evoked in growing terminals that influence the nucleus.

Retrograde transport of NGF occurs from nerve terminals to the cell body, but it is not 
clear whether this transport is required for survival (see Campenot157). 
Like many secreted proteins, nerve growth factor is initially translated as a longer polypeptide 
(pro-NGF) that is subsequently cleaved to the mature form.158 It had been generally assumed 
that only the mature forms of such signaling factors are active. However, it is now clear that not 
only are both forms of NGF active, but that they exhibit opposing biological activities, by acting 
on pairwise combinations of three different co-receptors (TrkA, p75NTR, and sortilin).159–161
Mature NGF binds with high affinity to TrkA, either alone or in combination with p75NTR, 
to promote cell survival and differentiation. ProNGF (the NGF precursor), by contrast, binds 
in a complex with sortilin and p75NTR to promote apoptosis. Intracellular pathways used by 
two growth factor receptors (TrkA and p75NTR) to trigger survival, apoptosis, and growth are 
shown in Figure 25.24. Thus, in the words of Feng and colleagues,159 “…the choice between life 
and death of neurons may be a delicate balance between cleavage or non-cleavage of proNGF, 
and expression of TrkA or p75NTR/sortilin receptor complexes on the cell surface.” 
NGF in the Central Nervous System
Nerve growth factor is not unique to the peripheral nervous system. A population of NGF-
sensitive cells has also been found within the CNS.162,163 These are cholinergic neurons 
located in the basal forebrain, particularly in the nucleus basalis. Their axons innervate 
the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (see Chapters 12 and 14). If the axons are cut in the 
adult rat, the cells die. If, however, NGF is infused into the CNS, then the cholinergic neu-
rons survive axotomy. The number of cells that stain with markers for cholinergic function 
declines with age, as does the ability of rats to learn a maze or other spatial memory tasks. 
If NGF is infused into aged rats, the number of cells that can be stained increases and the 
rat’s performance in spatial memory tasks improves.164 These observations indicate that 
survival and growth of neurons within the CNS are likely to rely on factors that are similar 
to those in peripheral neurons. Much research is now in progress to assess, in molecular 
terms, defects that might give rise to mental deficits, such as Alzheimer’s disease, in which 
one of the first signs is death of cholinergic neurons that supply the cortex.165
The Neurotrophins and other Families of Growth Factors
Other neurotrophic factors exist in the brain. One example, brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF), has been shown to promote the survival of dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture and 
to rescue them in vivo from natural neuronal death (see below).166–168 BDNF has a high degree 
of homology to NGF. Together NGF and BDNF defined a protein family called neurotrophins.2
Other members of the family are NT-3, NT-4/5, NT-6, and glial derived neurotrophic factor 
(GDNF).169,170 Early in development, before sensory neurons innervate their peripheral targets, 
neural crest cells and sensory neurons in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia require BDNF 
or NT-3 for proliferation, differentiation, and survival.171 At such early stages, neurotrophins

In addition to the neurotrophins, other types of neurotrophic proteins (many from 
muscle) have been identified that can sustain motoneurons. They include insulin-like growth 
factor (IGF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), and 
cholinergic differentiation factor (CDF), which is also called leukemia inhibitory factor 
(LIF) .176 When injected into embryos, these proteins rescue motoneurons that otherwise 
would have died. However, several lines of evidence, including analysis of mutant mice 
lacking one or more of these proteins or their receptors, suggest that no single identified 
factor is responsible for motoneuron survival during development.177
Formation of Connections
Establishment of the Retinotectal Map
Even after the growth cone guidance mechanisms described 
earlier guide axons to their destinations, the problem of 
matching each axon with its particular target cells re-
mains. The growth of retinal ganglion cell axons to their 
targets in the midbrain provides an example of signals 
that enable specific patterns of innervation in a tissue to 
be established. 
During development, axons from ganglion cells in 
the temporal (or posterior) part of the chick retina grow 
to innervate neurons in the anterior part of the tectum, 
while those arising from nasal (anterior) retina innervate 
posterior neurons (Figure 25.25). Experiments by Bon-
hoeffer and his colleagues demonstrated that axons sort 
out their territories through repulsive interactions that 
prevent growth cones of temporal axons from penetrating 
into the posterior tectum.178,179 Retinal ganglion cells in 
culture were allowed to grow into parallel lanes whose 
surfaces were coated with membranes purified from either 
the anterior or the posterior tectum. Axons from neurons 
in the nasal retina grew equally well on both membranes 
(Figure 25.25B). Temporal axons, however, preferred to 
grow on lanes coated with anterior membranes (Figure 
25.25C). However, when posterior membranes were dena-
tured by heat treatment, temporal axons no longer showed 
any preference (Figure 25.25D). Thus, their preference 
for the anterior lanes was not due to attraction by the

anterior membranes, but rather to repulsion by the posterior membrane. Curiously, when 
not offered a choice of membranes, retinal axons elongated rapidly on either substrate.
The molecules responsible for this repulsive interaction in the optic tectum (or superior 
colliculus in mammals) are members of a family of receptor tyrosine kinases (known as Eph 
kinases) and their ligands (called ephrins).180,181 Ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A5 are expressed 
in the tectum during the time retinotectal connections are being formed, and their con-
centration increases in a graded manner from anterior to posterior. The Eph A3 receptor is 
expressed on retinal axons in a corresponding nasotemporal gradient. When incorporated 
into lipid vesicles and added to the medium in which temporal retinal axons are growing, 
ephrins A2 and A5 cause the growth cones to detach from the substrate and retract.182
The other axis of the topographic projection maps the dorsoventral positions in the 
retina to mediolateral positions in the tectum. Here, patterning is achieved by a different 
family of ligands and receptors, the EphB/ephrin-B family. The cellular and molecular logic 
that underlies the dorsoventral/mediolateral mapping is more complex. Both attractive 
and repulsive interactions are involved, depending on the levels of ligands and receptors. 
Perturbation of these main mapping mechanisms reveals the importance of these and 
other ligand receptor signaling systems (e.g., other ephrins and Ephs; Wnt ligands and 
their Frizzled receptors) in fine-tuning the formation of patterns of innervation of a tissue. 
Later refinement of patterning is brought about by activity-dependent mechanisms183 (see 
also Chapter 26).
Synapse Formation
The vertebrate skeletal neuromuscular junction provides a favorable preparation for study-
ing the cellular and molecular mechanisms of synapse formation. The first steps in synapse 
formation occur rapidly. Mu-ming Poo and his colleagues have shown that as the growth 
cone of a motor axon approaches a myotube (i.e., an immature muscle fiber), depolarizing 
potentials arise due to the release of ACh from the growth cone (Figure 25.26).184 Upon 
contact, the rate of spontaneous release of quanta of ACh rapidly increases, as does the size 
of the synaptic potential evoked by stimulating the axon. Thus, within minutes a functional 
synaptic connection is established. In Chapter 27, we give an account of the properties and 
functions of a protein known as agrin, which is released from the motor nerve axon as it 
approaches the muscle fiber. Agrin causes postsynaptic structures to be formed and ACh 
receptors to accumulate at the motor end plate.185
Factors involved in formation of synapses in the CNS are not well understood, but two 
more families of interacting transmembrane proteins, neuroligins and neurexins, may play 
key roles in the functional development of chemical synapses.186,187 Neuroligins presented

presynaptic specializations, and similar presentation of neurexins (which share extracellular 
domains similar to those of agrin) induce the formation of postsynaptic specializations. 
Pruning and the Removal of Polyneuronal Innervation
Once synapses have formed and the population of neurons innervating a target has been 
restricted through cell death, axons of surviving neurons compete with one another for 
synaptic territory. This competition typically results in the loss of some of the terminal 
branches and synapses made initially—a process referred to as pruning.188 Pruning ensures 
appropriate and complete innervation of a target by a particular population of neurons. In 
some cases, pruning also provides a mechanism for correcting mistakes; in other instances, 
it appears to reflect a strategy for establishing pathways.
A clear example of competitive pruning occurs in developing skeletal muscle. In the 
adult, each motor neuron innervates a group of up to 300 muscle fibers, forming a motor 
unit (see Chapter 24), but each muscle fiber is innervated by only one axon. In developing 
muscle, however, motor neurons branch extensively so that each muscle fiber comes to be 
innervated by axons from several motor neurons (Figure 25.27)—a phenomenon called 
polyneuronal innervation.189,190 On each developing muscle fiber, the synaptic endings of 
multiple axons are interspersed at a single site and are juxtaposed to aggregates of ACh 
receptors and other components of the postsynaptic apparatus. As development progresses, 
axon branches are eliminated until the adult pattern is formed. This process does not involve

neuronal cell death (which occurs at an earlier developmental stage), only a reduction in 
the number of muscle fibers innervated by each motor neuron. 
The removal of polyneuronal innervation is mediated by competition between axons of 
different motor neurons for synaptic space on the muscle cell. A clear example comes from 
studies of a small muscle in the toe of the rat.191 When all but one of the motor axons innervat-
ing this muscle were cut early in development, the remaining axon spread to innervate many 
fibers within the muscle. During the period when elimination of polyneuronal innervation 
would normally occur, however, no synapses were lost. In the absence of competition, the 
surviving motor neuron maintained contacts with every myofiber it had innervated.
Neuronal Activity and Synapse Elimination
Neuronal activity plays a role in synapse elimination, influencing both the rate and out-
come of the competition between axon terminals. Stimulation of the nerve to a muscle, via 
implanted electrodes, increases the rate of synapse elimination.192 If activity is reduced, by 
applying tetrodotoxin in a cuff around the nerve to block action potentials or by inhibit-
ing synaptic transmission, synapse elimination is slowed.193 In muscles that receive input 
from axons that run in two different nerves, one can block impulses in one nerve and not 
the other.194 In such cases, inactive axons are at a competitive disadvantage, as axons in 
the blocked nerve innervate smaller than normal motor units and those in the active nerve 
innervate more fibers than usual.
Activity-dependent competition extends to the level of branches of a single mo-
tor axon.195 If a small region of an adult junction is inactivated by focal application of 
α-bungarotoxin, the inactive region of the junction is eliminated. If the entire junction is 
silenced, no elimination occurs. 
Similar competition for synaptic targets occurs during the development of CNS 
pathways. One example is the formation of the ocular dominance columns in visual cortex 
(see Chapter 26), in which axons from the LGN conveying information from the two eyes 
initially overlap extensively in layer 4 of the cortex and then sort out into left-eye and 
right-eye columns.196 Here the pattern of activity in the terminals from the two eyes plays 
a decisive role in determining the outcome of the competition. It is tempting to speculate 
that pruning may occur through competition for a limited amount of target-derived trophic 
factor, such as NGF or BDNF.
General Considerations of Neural Specificity 
and Development
Considerable progress has been made in understanding how nerve cells differentiate, find 
their targets, and establish synaptic contacts. However, when one contemplates the num-
ber and specificity of the fate decisions that must be made and connections that must be 
formed when wiring up the nervous system, the problem seems daunting. A commonplace 
analogy may be encouraging. Let us assume that we are ignorant about the workings and 
design of the postal system. A chapter from a book on the nervous system, without its il-
lustrations, is posted in Trieste, Italy, and addressed to Sunderland, Massachusetts, USA, 
where it arrives a few days later. How does it get there? The writer knows only the closest 
mailbox and is unaware even of the post office in his district. The postal worker who emp-
ties the mailbox knows the post office; there the clerk who handles the mail may not know 
where Sunderland is but does know how to direct the package to the airport, and so on, to 
the right country, city, street, building, and eventually the correct person. If this were not 
enough, the illustrations that complement the chapter are posted separately from Berkeley 
and Baltimore to the same destination, where they arrive almost simultaneously with the 
chapter from Trieste. All the while, other mail is moving through the same mailboxes and 
post offices in different directions to different destinations.
The comforting feature of this analogy is that, although the problem seems altogether 
baffling at first sight, one can solve the postal puzzle by following the mail step by step to its 
destination. This would reveal some of the logic and design of postal organization (albeit 
without disclosing the identity of the designer). At any one step, only a limited number of 
instructions are followed and a limited number of mechanisms operate.

562 Chapter 25
Some aspects of neural specificity may not be too different. A retinal ganglion cell 
sends its axon toward the back of the eye, where it makes a turn to enter the optic nerve 
together with fibers from other regions of the retina. The optic chiasm presents the next 
choice point, where the decision to enter the optic tract, leading either to the left of the 
right LGN may be made based on local chemical signals. Within the LGN, retinal axons 
may arrange themselves and innervate their targets according to gradients of repulsive 
molecules. Axons of geniculate neurons likewise follow a fairly simple path to their targets 
in the cortex, stopping along the way to form transient connections with subplate neurons. 
Thus, the seemingly complex task of forming specific connections between retinal ganglion 
cells and neurons in the visual cortex can be broken down into a series of relatively simple, 
independent events, each of which shapes the next. This general principle also applies to 
the even more complex question of how retinal ganglion cells, and all the many other types 
of neurons and non-neuronal cells, are generated in the proper numbers and places as the 
organism develops from the fertilized egg. 
SUMMARY
 
■
During vertebrate embryogenesis, proteins diffuse from 
the organizer, to induce formation of the neural plate, 
the edges of which fold upward to form the neural tube.
 
■
In the vertebrate CNS, the fates of developing neurons 
are specified according to anteroposterior position and 
dorsoventral position.
 
■
Hox genes determine anteroposterior identity in the 
hindbrain. 
 
■
Along the length of the neural tube, gradients of Sonic 
hedgehog protein (produced by the notochord and floor 
plate) and bone morphogenetic protein (emanating from 
the roof plate) regulate ventral and dorsal neural fates, 
respectively. 
 
■
Cells divide rapidly at the ventricular surface of the 
neural tube. Postmitotic neurons and glial progenitor 
cells migrate away from the ventricular surface of the 
neural tube to form the CNS.
 
■
In mammalian cerebral cortex, development proceeds 
in an inside-out fashion. Neurons of the deepest cortical 
layers are born first. 
 
■
Division of neural stem cells in the central nervous 
system of adult birds and mammals continually produces 
new neurons. In the adult human, new cells are produced 
in hippocampus but not in cerebral cortex.
 
■
Neuronal migration occurs along radial glial cells and 
pathways marked by cell surface and extracellular 
matrix components.
 
■
The ultimate identity of a cell is determined by cell 
lineage and inductive interactions.
 
■
Neural crest cells arise from the edge of the neural 
fold and migrate away from the neural tube to form the 
peripheral nervous system, pigment cells, and bones of 
the head. 
 
■
The transmitter synthesized by a sympathetic neuron is 
determined by its environment.
 
■
The tip of a growing axon expands to form a growth cone.
 
■
Cell surface and extracellular matrix adhesion 
molecules guide growth cones by short-range attractive 
and repulsive mechanisms.
 
■
Netrins and semaphorins act as long-range 
chemoattractant or chemorepellents for different types 
of axons depending on what receptors are expressed 
on their growth cone surfaces. 
 
■
When a motoneuron growth cone contacts a muscle 
cell, functional synaptic transmission is established 
within minutes.
 
■
The ephrins and the Eph family of receptor tyrosine 
kinases influence pathfinding, cell migration, and cell 
intermingling by a chemorepellent mechanism.
 
■
Neurons rely on trophic factors for survival and 
differentiation.
 
■
Programmed neuronal death (apoptosis) is a common 
feature of neural development. 
 
■
Synaptic connections, once established, are pruned 
to ensure appropriate and complete innervation of 
the target. Pruning occurs through activity-dependent 
competition among axon terminals for target-derived 
trophic substances.

■ CHAPTER 26
Critical Periods in 
Sensory Systems
T
his chapter describes the effects of use and disuse on the visual systems of newborn 
kittens and monkeys. Experiments made by Wiesel and Hubel have shown that visual 
input in early life plays an essential role in developing structure and function of neurons 
in the visual cortex. At the time of birth, the receptive fields of neurons in the retina, lateral ge-
niculate nucleus (LGN), and visual cortex resemble those of adults. There is, however, a marked 
difference in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex (V1) of the newborn animal, in which incoming 
geniculate axons from the two eyes overlap in their territory instead of being separated. As a 
result, neurons in layer 4 of neonatal cortex are driven by both eyes. During the first 6 weeks, 
the adult pattern is established. Lateral geniculate axons arising from the two eyes segregate so 
that cells in layer 4 respond to visual stimuli in only one eye. If one eye receives greater visual 
input, it takes over the territory of the other eye in the cortex. Closure of the lids of one eye dur-
ing the first 3 months of life leads to blindness in that eye, and loss of its ability to drive corti-
cal cells. Columns in the visual cortex and the geniculate axons supplied by the deprived eye 
shrink, while those supplied by the normal, undeprived eye expand. These results suggest that 
there is competition for territory in early life. Lid closure in adult animals has no effect on colum-
nar architecture or responses to visual stimuli. 
Evidence for competition between the two eyes is provided by experiments in which both eyes 
were deprived by lid closure shortly after birth or when an ocular muscle was cut in a newborn so 
as to produce a squint (strabismus). When neither eye has an advantage, normal columnar struc-
ture develops; however, each neuron in the cortex is driven by only one eye. The role of impulse 
activity in competition was shown by blocking impulse traffic in both optic nerves by application 
of tetrodotoxin (TTX). Under these conditions, ocular dominance columns failed to segregate. 
Appropriate sensory input is also essential in the development of the auditory system. Barn owls 
localize their prey by sight and sound. The visual and auditory maps of the outside world are nor-
mally aligned in the optic tectum at birth. When the visual input is displaced by applying prisms 
to the two eyes, young owls adapt to this mismatch in auditory and visual maps of the outside 
world. The receptive fields of auditory neurons in the tectum shift over days and weeks to fit the 
displaced visual map. Once the prisms are removed, the visual fields again shift abruptly, while the 
auditory fields move back slowly over time. After a critical period, such shifts in auditory receptive 
fields no longer occur. In owls brought up in an enriched environment with enhanced sensory ex-
perience, the critical period during which maps can be brought into register is prolonged. Sensory 
deprivation experiments are significant for considering the development of higher brain functions.

566 Chapter 26
In previous chapters, we have emphasized that highly specific connections are necessary 
for the nervous system to function properly. This chapter shows that development and 
fine-tuning of connections between neurons are not complete at birth. For example, 
kittens—unlike monkeys that are able to see at birth—are born with their eyes closed. 
If the lids are opened and light is shone into an eye, the pupil constricts, but the animal 
appears to be completely blind.1 By 10 days, the kitten shows evidence of vision and 
thereafter begins to recognize objects and patterns. When kittens are brought up in to-
tal darkness, the pupillary reflex continues to function, but they remain blind. On the 
other hand, adult cats that have been kept in darkness for prolonged periods can see 
immediately when exposed to light. Such results suggest that there is a critical period of 
vulnerability in early life. One might intuit that circuits, such as those used for spinal 
cord or pupillary reflexes, should be genetically determined, whereas the development 
of circuits controlling complex functions might require continuous interaction with the 
environment. What are the relative contributions of genetic factors and experience for 
cortical development? What mechanisms ensure that cortical circuits become stabilized 
when development is complete?
In this chapter, we show that the visual systems of the kitten and newborn monkey 
are first established in utero by intrinsic, genetically driven neuronal differentiation. Then, 
for a brief, well-defined period, visual experience refines neuronal circuits for optimal 
operation in the growing animal. We start by focusing on work that follows logically from 
the material presented in Chapters 2 and 3. Studies of the role of experience in forming 
the immature visual system set the stage for analyzing plasticity in other sensory circuits, 
notably the auditory system in birds and mammals.
The Visual System in Newborn Monkeys and Kittens
A good deal is known about the organization of the connections that underlie visual 
perception in the adult cat and monkey. A simple cell in the cortex selectively recognizes 
one well-defined type of visual stimulus, such as the movement of a narrow bar of light 
oriented vertically, in a particular region of the visual field of either eye. Such responses 
are possible because of the precise and orderly connections made to cortical cells from the 
retina by way of the lateral geniculate nucleus (see Chapters 2 and 3). It is natural to wonder 
whether cells and connections of this type are already present in the newborn animal or 
whether they develop as a result of visual experience, in which case, visual stimuli in early 
life would direct or refine a set of preexisting connections.
To study visually naive animals, monkeys were taken immediately after natural birth 
or after delivery by cesarean section, with care being taken to avoid exposure to light. To 
prevent form vision until animals were old enough to be studied, the lids were either su-
tured or the cornea was covered by a translucent occluder, which blurs images but allows 
light to pass. Other visually naive animals, such as kittens, rats, and ferrets, have also been 
examined during the first weeks after birth.2–5
Receptive Fields and Response Properties of Cortical Cells 
in Newborn Animals
A newborn monkey appears visually alert and is able to fixate. The responses of cortical 
neurons in many ways resemble those of the adult animal. For example, recordings made 
from individual cells in V1 show that the cells are not driven by diffuse illumination. As 
in a mature animal, they fire best when light or dark bars with a particular orientation 
are shone onto a particular region of the retina.2 In recordings made in animals lacking 
prior visual experience, the range of orientations cannot be distinguished from that in 
adults. The receptive fields are also organized into antagonistic “on” and “off” areas that 
are driven by both eyes. Moreover, with oblique penetrations, the preferred orientation 
changes in a regular sequence as the electrode moves through the cortex (Figure 26.1). 
Figure 26.1 also shows that orientation preference maps with characteristic pinwheels 
(see Chapter 3) are already evident, with all orientations represented equally at the time 
of birth.4

Critical Periods in Sensory Systems 567
Ocular Dominance Columns in 
Newborn Monkeys and Kittens
At birth, most cells in all layers of V1 are already 
driven by both eyes—some better by one eye, 
some by the other, and some equally well by both. 
Figure 26.2 shows the distribution of responses 
of neurons distributed throughout all cortical 
layers according to eye preference in immature 
and adult monkeys.
The degree of ocular dominance is expressed 
in the histograms by grouping neurons into seven 
categories according to the discharge frequency 
with which they responded to stimulation of one 
or the other eye (see Chapter 3). The majority 
of cells respond to appropriate illumination of 
either eye. Cells in groups 1 and 7 in Figure 26.2 
were driven only by visual stimuli applied to one 
eye, while those in groups 2 through 6 responded 
to both eyes.
The histograms of Figure 26.2A and B appear 
similar, with a range of eye preferences for cells 
throughout the cortical layers. What these data 
fail to show however is a striking and important 
difference in the properties of cells in layer 4. In 
that layer, cells in the newborn monkey are driven 
by both eyes; after 6 weeks of development, cells 
in layer 4 are driven by one eye only.6 Outside 
of layer 4, cortical cells in newborn monkeys 
appear similar in their responses to those in 
adults, except that in some cells discharges are 
less vigorous or absent.

Postnatal Development of Ocular Dominance Columns
LeVay, Wiesel, and Hubel7 (also Rakic;8,9 see the next section) found a striking and im-
portant anatomical difference between adult and newborn in the geniculate innervation 
of layer 4 in V1. In contrast to the well-segregated geniculate terminals in the adult, ar-
borizations of geniculate fibers ending in layer 4 overlap extensively in newborn kittens 
(Figure 26.3). As a result of the overlap in territories supplied by each eye, the immature 
neurons in layer 4 respond to stimulation of both eyes rather than just one.7 Similarly, 
during the first 6 weeks of a monkey’s life, the axons of geniculate cells in layer 4 retract 
to form smaller arborizations, as though pruned. In this way, separate domains of cortex 
in layer 4 become established, each supplied exclusively by one or the other eye (Figure 
26.4). Comparable changes during development occur 
at the preceding stage in the lateral geniculate nucleus 
of the visual pathway.10,11 As optic nerve fibers from 
the two eyes grow into the nucleus, their arborizations 
overlap extensively before they separate into distinct 
layers. The early postnatal development of ocular domi-
nance columns and geniculate layers that starts before 
birth, proceeds in animals reared in total darkness. The 
retraction of geniculate axons in layer 4 is reminiscent 
of the events occurring during the development of 
nerve–muscle synapses in neonatal rats. At birth, each 
motor end plate is supplied by numerous motoneurons, 
but in a few weeks, most of the axons retract, leaving 
each muscle fiber supplied by just one motoneuron12

Effects of Abnormal Visual Experience in Early Life
This section describes three types of experiments, mostly performed by Hubel and Wiesel 
in the first instance, in which animals were deprived of normal visual stimuli.6,13 They 
studied the effects on the physiological responses of nerve cells and the structure of the 
visual system after (1) closing the lids of one or both eyes; (2) preventing form vision, but 
not access of light to the eye; and (3) leaving light and form vision intact, but producing an 
artificial strabismus (squint) in one eye. These procedures cause remarkable abnormalities 
in the function and anatomy of the cortex. 
Blindness after Lid Closure
When the lids of one eye were sutured during the first 2 weeks of life, monkeys and kittens 
still developed normally and used their unoperated eye. At the end of 1 to 3 months, how-
ever, when the operated eye was opened and the normal one closed, it was clear that the 
animals were practically blind in the previously deprived eyes. For example, kittens would 
bump into objects and fall off tables.6,14 There was no gross evidence of a physiological 
defect within the eyes—pupillary reflexes appeared normal and so did the electroretino-
gram, which is an index of the average electrical activity of the eye. Records made from 
retinal ganglion cells in deprived animals showed no changes in their responses, and their 
receptive fields appeared normal.
Responses of Cortical Cells after Monocular Deprivation
Although responses of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus appeared relatively unchanged 
after monocular deprivation,15 there were major changes in the responses of cortical cells.6,16,17
When electrical recordings were made in the visual cortex, very few cells could be driven 
by the eye that had been closed. The majority of those that did respond had abnormal 
receptive fields. Responses of cells driven by the undeprived eye were normal. Figure 26.5 
shows ocular dominance histograms obtained from the cells examined in monkeys and 
kittens raised with closure of one eye during the first weeks of life.
Relative Importance of Diffuse Light and Form 
for Maintaining Normal Responses
The results described so far indicate that if one eye is not used normally in the 
first weeks of life, its power wanes and it ceases to be effective in the visual cortex. 
These far-reaching changes are produced by the relatively minor procedure of 
closing the lids, without cutting any nerves. What is the important condition for 
maintaining and developing proper visual responses? Is diffuse light adequate?
Lid closure reduces the level of light that reaches the retina but does not exclude 
it. A series of experiments in newborn kittens demonstrated that form vision, rather 
than the mere presence of light, is required to prevent abnormal development of 
cortical connections. A plastic occluder (like a ping-pong ball) was placed over 
the cornea instead of closing the eyelids; the occluder prevented form vision but 
admitted light. All these cats were blind in the deprived eye.14 Furthermore, corti-
cal cells were no longer driven by the deprived eye. Neither retinal nor geniculate 
responses were noticeably changed under such conditions.
Morphological Changes in the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus 
after Visual Deprivation
Cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus of cat and of monkey are arranged in layers, 
each supplied predominantly by one or the other eye (see Chapter 2). In the same 
animals that showed marked abnormalities in the cortex after lid closure, the ge-
niculate cells seemed at first to be normal. Nevertheless, it was shown that marked 
changes in morphology occurred after lid closure of one eye, resulting in cells that 
were noticeably smaller than in the layers supplied by the undeprived eye.15 The

reduction in size depended on the duration of lid closure. Surprisingly, the shrunken cells 
showed little physiological deficit. Several lines of evidence suggest that the size of the LGN 
may cells in reflect the extent of their arborization in the cortex.18,19
Morphological Changes in the Cortex after Visual Deprivation
The morphological consequences of eye closure are particularly conspicuous in layer 4 of 
the visual cortex V1, where geniculate fibers terminate in an orderly manner.7,20 Changes 
in ocular dominance columns following lid closure in monkeys have been revealed by au-
toradiography of the cortex after injection of radioactive materials into one eye. After lid 
closure, there is a marked reduction in the width of ocular dominance columns receiving 
projections from the occluded eye. At the same time, the columns with inputs from the 
normal eye show a corresponding increase in width compared with that seen in a normal 
adult monkey. The shrinkage of ocular dominance columns is evident in Figure 26.6, in 
which the normal columns can be compared with columns in animals in which one eye 
had been closed at 2 weeks and left closed for 18 months. The changes indicate that genicu-
late axons activated by the normal eye retained or captured territory in the cortex lost by 
their weaker, visually deprived neighbors. These results are consistent with physiological 
observations made by recording from cells in layer 4. Almost all cells were driven only by 
the eye that had not been deprived. Certain features of the cortex, such as the alternating 
striped pattern of cytochrome oxidase staining in secondary visual cortex (V2),21 are less 
vulnerable to deprivation than layer 4 in V1.22
Critical Period for Susceptibility to Lid Closure
When the lids of one eye are closed in an adult cat or monkey, no abnormal consequences 
are seen.6,7 Even if an eye is closed for over a year, the cells in the cortex continue to be driven

normally by both eyes and display the normal ocular dominance histogram. Moreover, after 
one eye has been completely removed in an adult monkey, the structure of layer 4 remains 
normal when observed with autoradiography or other staining methods, even though 
there is atrophy in the LGN. This finding indicates a remarkable resistance to change in 
layer 4 of the adult animal when compared with the changes seen in the immature animal.
In monkeys, the greatest sensitivity to lid closure is during the first 6 weeks of life.6,7,20
At any time during that period, with a peak at 1 week of age,23 substantial changes in eye 
preference and columnar architecture develop if one eye is closed for a few days. During the 
subsequent months (up to about 12 to 16 months), several weeks of closure are required 
to produce obvious changes in ocular dominance histograms or the width of columns 
in layer 4. At later times, changes do not develop even after surgical removal of one eye.
The period of greatest susceptibility to lid closure in kittens has been narrowed down to 
the fourth and fifth weeks after birth.24,25 During the first 3 weeks or so of life, eye closure 
has little effect. This is not surprising, since the kittens’ eyes are normally closed for the 
first 10 days. But abruptly, during weeks 4 and 5, sensitivity increases. Closure at that age 
for as little as 3 to 4 days leads to a sharp decline in the number of cells that can be driven 
by the deprived eye. An experiment in which littermates are compared is shown in Figure 
26.7. In this example, 6- and 8-day closures starting at the age of 23 and 30 days (Figure 
26.7A,B) caused about as great an effect as 3 months of monocular deprivation from birth. 
The susceptibility to lid closure declines after the critical period has passed and eventually 
disappears by about 3 months of age (Figure 26.7C). The critical period can, however, be 
prolonged by rearing kittens in the dark.26,27 Then, susceptibility to monocular closure can 
still be demonstrated at 6 months of age, as though stimulus-driven activity is required 
to complete eye-specific cortical contacts. However, there is evidence that even a brief 
exposure of the kitten to light for a few hours may be sufficient to prevent such extension 
of the critical period.
Recovery during the Critical Period
To what extent is recovery possible after lid closure during the critical period? Even if 
the deprived eye in an adult cat or monkey is subsequently opened for months or years, 
the damage remains, with little or no recovery. Thus, the animal continues to be blind in

that eye, with shrunken columns and skewed ocular dominance histograms. In animals 
with monocular closure, experiments have been made in which the lids were opened in 
the deprived eye and closed over the normal eye (Figure 26.8). This procedure, termed 
reverse suture, leads to a recovery of vision, provided it is carried out during the critical 
period.7,28,29 Monkeys and kittens not only begin to see again with the initially deprived eye, 
but they become blind in the other eye. Accompanying these changes, the ocular dominance 
histograms switch; that is, the newly opened eye drives most cells, while the eye that had 
been opened for the first weeks (now closed) cannot. Moreover, the anatomical pattern in 
layer 4 revealed by autoradiography shows a corresponding change: The shrunken regions 
supplied by the initially closed eye expand at the expense of the initially open (but then 
closed) eye (Figure 26.8C). 
The conclusions from these experiments are that: (1) during the critical period in a normal 
animal, geniculate fibers supplying layer 4 of the cortex retract so that each eye supplies 
areas of comparable extent; (2) lid closure of one eye during the critical period leads to 
unequal retraction; and (3) reverse suture during the critical period produces sprouting 
of the geniculate axons so that an eye can recapture the cells it had lost (Figure 26.9).30 If 
postponed until adulthood, reverse suture is without effect. For example, in a monkey in 
which the reverse suture was performed at 1 year of age, the labeled columns for the initially 
deprived eye remained shrunken.

Requirements for Maintenance of Functioning 
Connections in the Visual System
At this stage one might be tempted to conclude that simple loss of activity in the visual 
pathways is the main factor that disrupts normal responses of cortical neurons. After all, 
cortical cells are driven not by diffuse illumination but by shapes and forms, so in the absence 
of form vision, cortical activity ceases. The following discussion shows that there must be 
additional causes that are more subtle than loss of activity. In particular, impulse activity 
from the two eyes interacts competitively to determine cortical connectivity.
Binocular Lid Closure and the Role of Competition
The first clue that loss of visually evoked activity cannot on its own account for the changed 
performance of neurons is shown by the following experiments. Both eyes were closed in 
monkeys that were either newborn at term or delivered prematurely by cesarean section.2,6
From the preceding discussion, one might guess that cells in the cortex would subsequently 
be driven by neither eye. Surprisingly, however, after binocular closure for 17 days or lon-
ger, most cortical cells could still be driven by appropriate illumination, and the receptive 
fields of simple and complex cells appeared largely normal. The columnar organization for 
orientation was similar to that in controls (see Figure 26.1). The principal abnormality was 
the appearance of a substantial fraction of the cells that could not be driven binocularly. 
In addition, some spontaneously active cells could not be driven at all, and others did not 
require specifically oriented stimuli. However, the areas of cortex supplied by each eye were 
equal, and the pattern resembled that seen in normal adult monkeys—that is, in layer 4, 
cells were driven by one eye only, and columns were well defined when marked by auto-
radiography or by cytochrome oxidase. Binocular closure in kittens led to similar effects, 
except that more cortical cells continued to be binocularly driven.17 The arborizations of 
lateral geniculate axons in layer 4 were not shrunken.30 At the same time, cells in the lateral 
geniculate body showed atrophy (a decrease in size of approximately 40%) in all layers.
The conclusion from these experiments is that some, but not all, of the ill effects 
expected from closing one eye are reduced or averted by closing both eyes. It is as though 
inputs from the two eyes are in competition for representation in cortical cells, and with 
one eye closed, the contest becomes unequal.
Effects of Strabismus (Squint)
The abnormal effects described in the preceding discussion were produced by suturing 
eyelids or by using translucent diffusers, implicating loss of form vision. Following the clue 
that cross-eyed children (i.e., those with strabismus or squint) or wall-eyed children can 
become blind in one eye, Hubel and Wiesel produced artificial strabismus in kittens and 
newborn monkeys by cutting an eye muscle.6,31 The optical axis of that eye was thereby 
deflected from normal. Under such conditions, illumination and pattern stimulation for 
each eye remained unchanged but the visual fields were not aligned.

FIGURE 26.9 Summary of Effects of 
Eye Closure. In a normal monkey, ocu-
lar dominance columns have become 
well defined in layer 4 of the cortex by 
6 weeks. Lid closure causes excessive 
retraction of geniculate fibers supplied 
by the deprived eye. Those supplied by 
the open eye retract less than usual, so 
their columns in layer 4 of the cortex 
are larger than normal in the adult. After 
reverse suture during the critical period, 
the initially deprived eye can recapture 
the territory it had lost in layer 4. (After 
Hubel and Wiesel, 1977.)

The results at first seemed disappointing because after several months vision in 
both eyes of the operated animals appeared normal, and Hubel and Wiesel were about 
to abandon a laborious set of experiments. Nevertheless, they recorded from cortical 
cells and consistently obtained the following results. Individual cortical cells had normal 
receptive fields and responded briskly to precisely oriented stimuli. But almost every 
cell responded only to one eye; some cells were driven only by the ipsilateral eye and 
others only by the contralateral, but almost none were driven by both. The cells were, 
as usual, grouped in columns with respect to eye preference and field axis orientation.32
As expected, no atrophy occurred in the lateral geniculate nucleus, and the columnar 
architecture of layer 4 was unchanged. The almost complete lack of binocular representa-
tion in cortical cells was apparent in histograms from monkeys with artificial strabismus. 
The critical period for displaced images to produce changes was comparable to that for 
monocular deprivation.
These experiments provide an example in which all the usual parameters of light are 
normal—the amount of illumination and form and pattern stimuli. The only change 
consists of a failure of the images to fall on corresponding regions of the two retinas. The 
factor that seems important for the loss of binocular convergence of geniculate projections 
to the cortex is lack of congruity of input from the two eyes. It is as though the homologous 
receptive fields in both eyes must be in register with one another, so that excitation will be 
simultaneous. The following experiments further support this idea. 
During the first 3 months of its life, the eyes of a kitten were occluded with an opaque 
plastic cover that was switched on alternate days from one eye to the other, so that the two 
eyes received the same total experience, but at different times.31 The result was the same 
as in the cross-eyed experiments, demonstrating that cells were driven predominantly by 
either one eye or the other, but not by both. The maintenance of normal binocularity, 
therefore, depends not only on the amount of impulse traffic but also on the appropriate 
spatial and temporal overlap of activity in the different incoming fibers. 
Changes in Orientation Preference 
A logical question to ask is whether raising animals in an environment in which they see 
only one orientation can change the orientation preference of cortical cells. An experimental 
approach that involved competition as well as deprivation was used by Carlson, Hubel, and 
Wiesel.33 The lids of one eye were sutured in a newborn monkey. The animal was kept in 
darkness except when it placed its head in a holder (Figure 26.10). Then, with the head held 
vertically, it would see vertical stripes with the unsutured eye. Since the monkey received 
orange juice each time it placed its head in the holder correctly, it performed this maneu-
ver frequently. Thus, during the critical period, one eye received no visual input, while the 
other saw only vertical stripes. After 57 hours of experience between 12 and 54 days after 
birth, normal levels of cortical activity were found, with cells of all orientations arranged 
as usual in columns. As expected, the open eye tended to dominate.
When tests were made for orientation preference, the results shown in Figure 26.10 
were obtained. Both eyes could drive cells well when horizontal lines were the stimulus. 
However, the left eye (the open eye) was considerably more effective for vertical stripes. 
The probable explanation for this result is that neither eye saw horizontal bars or edges 
during the critical period. Hence, the stimulation for horizontality is analogous to binocular 
closure; that is, the competition is equal. For the vertical input, however, the open eye had 
an enriched experience and in a sense captured cells in vertical orientation columns that 
had previously been supplied by the deprived eye. Similar results have been obtained by 
Bonhoeffer and his colleagues in kittens reared in a striped environment.34 
Segregation of Visual Inputs without Competition
In the experiments described so far, an underlying principle has been that the two eyes 
compete for connections and territory in the LGN and in layer 4 of V1, starting off with 
roughly equal opportunity. Rakic and his colleagues have used a different approach to study 
how neighboring groups of cells with defined properties sort out their terminals and their 
targets as they develop, without competition.35

As described in Chapter 3, the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) systems occupy 
distinct layers in the LGN and in visual cortex. By staining individual M and P axons during 
development, as they grow into the lateral geniculate nucleus, Rakic and his colleagues have 
shown that axons from the outset arrive in the correct M and P layers, where they form char-
acteristic, non-overlapping arborizations. M fibers end only in geniculate layers 1 and 2, while 
P fibers end only in layers 3, 4, 5, and 6, with no spillover. Hence, when the two eyes develop 
their connections, one can suppose that competition plays a role for inputs that provide similar 
information about the visual world. By contrast, the M and P systems carry quite different 
types of information. Their connections (like those involved in the formation of blobs and 
or the stripes in visual area 2)21 develop according to principles in which competition is not 
of the essence. A further example of connections that form without signs of competition is 
the alignment of orientation maps in the visual cortex of the kitten.36
Effects of Impulse Activity on the Developing Visual System
The role of impulse activity in shaping synaptic connections has been studied in experi-
ments on kittens. When the lids are closed or the animal is brought up in complete dark-
ness, impulse traffic in the visual pathways does not stop entirely. Neurons continue to 
fire spontaneously, and ocular dominance columns develop as segregated areas in layer 4.
Experiments by Stryker, Shatz, and their colleagues37,38 have shown that this presum-
ably equal spontaneous activity from the two eyes is important for normal development.

perience. The monkey was kept in a dark room. At 12 days, the right eye was closed. Whenever 
the monkey placed its head in a holder (to ensure that the head was not tilted), it received orange 
juice. At that time, it also saw vertical stripes with its left eye. For a total of 57 hours of exposure 
between 12 and 54 days, the only visual experience was an image of vertical lines seen by the 
left eye. The right eye saw nothing. (A) After 54 days the right eye was re-opened and horizon-
tally oriented light stimuli shone onto the screen stimulated cortical cells driven by the left eye or 
the right eye equally well. In this histogram, no deprivation is apparent for horizontal orientation, 
except for a lack of binocular cells. (B) With vertically oriented stimuli, the left eye, which had been 
kept open to view vertical stripes, was much more effective in driving cortical cells. The histogram 
resembles that seen after monocular deprivation. The results suggest that competition was equal 
for horizontal stimuli that neither eye had ever seen, and unequal for vertical stimuli (favored by 
the left, open eye). (After Carlson, Hubel, and Wiesel, 1986.)

Tetrodotoxin (TTX), which blocks action potentials, was injected into both eyes of newborn 
kittens. Several days after removal of the toxin, impulse conduction in the visual pathways 
from retina through the geniculate to the cortex was restored. However, in the lateral 
geniculate nucleus, inputs from the two eyes had failed to segregate into separate layers 
(Figure 26.11). Moreover, cells in layer 4 of the visual cortex were still driven by both eyes 
as in the newborn animal, and the ocular dominance columns revealed by autoradiography 
resembled the neonatal pattern, with extensive overlap and no clear boundaries. Thus, in the 
absence of all firing, optic nerve fibers failed to segregate in the geniculate, and geniculate 
fibers failed to retract normally in layer 4 of the cortex.
The effects of lid closure on ocular dominance columns can also be modified by 
blocking impulse activity within the cortex itself (Figure 26.12). TTX was infused into the 
visual cortex of a kitten during the critical period while one eye was deprived of form and 
light.39 After the TTX was removed, cortical cells were responsive to stimuli in both eyes, 
even though one had been deprived. Again, in the absence of activity, retraction failed to 
occur. Stryker and his colleagues performed similar experiments, using agents that inhibited 
firing of cortical neurons but left geniculate axons functional.40 Their results indicated that 
postsynaptic activity also played a role in retraction. Thus, it is not 
simply the amount of incoming activity that is important but also 
whether that activity successfully drives cortical neurons.
Synchronized Spontaneous Activity in the Absence 
of Inputs during Development
The experiments with TTX suggest that action potential activity in the 
visual pathway is necessary for the sorting of axons to their appropri-
ate targets. Without ongoing activity, axons remain spread across layers 
in the LGN and across boundaries of ocular dominance columns in 
the cortex. Yet, as we have seen, much of the development has already 
proceeded by the time of birth. In the darkness of the womb, before a 
kitten or a monkey has seen anything and before photoreceptors have 
become functional, the layers of the LGN and the cortical columns are 
recognizable. Does this mean that early development proceeds without 
action potential activity, or is there intrinsic impulse activity in the sys-
tem that guides development? Maffei and his colleagues demonstrated 
that synchronous bursts of action potential traffic do, in fact, propagate 
along the optic nerve in utero.41

Meister, Baylor, and their colleagues showed that there are periodic, synchronized 
waves of firing of neighboring ganglion cells in retinas isolated from immature ferrets and 
fetal kittens.42 In these experiments, the retina was placed in a chamber over an array of 
61 electrodes; from each electrode, it was possible to identify the discharges of as many as 
four different ganglion cells. Recordings of this type revealed an ordered pattern of activity 
sweeping across the retina from ganglion cell to ganglion cell. An example is shown in Figure 
26.13. Small black dots represent the positions of retinal ganglion cells, larger blue dots 
show the location of action potential discharges, and the size of the dot indicates discharge 
frequency. Successive frames were taken at 0.5-second intervals. The wave of activity spread 
across the retina over a period of about 3 seconds. Typically, such waves recurred repeatedly, 
separated by silent periods on the order of 2 seconds in duration. Wong43 has reported a 
similar wave-like spread of transient changes in intracellular calcium concentration and 
suggested that these play a role in synchronization of the electrical activity. There is evidence 
that cholinergic neurons, starburst amacrine cells, and electrical coupling play a part in 
the generation of the coordinated firing of ganglion cells in the immature retina.44–46 It 
will be shown below that waves of intrinsic activity also occur in the developing cochlea. 
Role of γ-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) and Trophic Molecules in 
Development of Columnar Architecture
The refinement of ocular dominance columns involves interactions between excitatory 
thalamocortical inputs and GABAergic inhibitory cortical interneurons. Chronic infusion 
of cat visual cortex with diazepam, a positive modulator of GABAA receptors, reduced the 
binocularity of cortical neurons and broadened anatomically defined ocular dominance 
columns.47 Downregulation of GABAA receptors produced opposite effects. Similarly, 
knockout mice lacking the GABA synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 
kDa (GAD65) lacked ocular dominance plasticity, and plasticity was restored by cortical 
infusion of diazepam.48 Cortical plasticity may involve a specific subtype of GABAergic 
interneuron. Synapse formation on pyramidal cells in the visual cortex by parvalbumin-
positive GABAergic neurons is influenced by visual experience during early postnatal 
life.49 Quite remarkably, transplantation of embryonic inhibitory neurons into mouse 
visual cortex (at postnatal day 10) extended the period of ocular dominance plasticity 
to postnatal day 43; this is 2 weeks beyond the normal close of the critical period on 
postnatal day 28.50 These findings indicate that inhibitory interneurons are important for 
maintaining the period for development of ocular dominance. This hypothesis receives 
additional support from the role of extracellular matrix (ECM) in synapse stabilization 
and brain plasticity.51 Large perineuronal nets of ECM develop around parvalbumin-
positive cells (thought to be GABAergic inhibitory interneurons) at the end of the ocular 
dominance critical period. Enzymatic degradation of ECM can restore ocular dominance 
plasticity to visual cortex in adult rats.52 It is postulated that growing perineuronal nets

of ECM stabilize inhibitory synapses and so fix the excitatory/inhibitory balance that 
defines ocular dominance.
Experience-driven mechanisms that influence the formation and maintenance of cortical 
structure presumably require molecular cues for axonal pathfinding and for trophic support 
of synaptic connections. Maffei and his colleagues first provided experimental evidence that 
neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF), can prevent the effects of monocular lid closure in the developing rat visual sys-
tem.53,54 The supposition is that column shrinkage during deprivation occurs when axons fail 
to receive sufficient trophic molecules from their target cell and withdraw their connections 
(see Chapter 25). Introduction of extrinsic NGF into the region allows synaptic connections 
to be maintained, thereby preventing column shrinkage. The introduction of anti-NGF 
antibody blocks this effect. Moreover, in the developing visual system, NGF antibodies cause 
shrinkage of cells and prolongation of the critical period, as though a normal trophic action 
of NGF were being antagonized.55 BDNF also may play a role in cortical plasticity. Transgenic 
overexpression of cortical BDNF in mice hastened the formation of inhibitory synapses and 
accelerated the onset and closure of the ocular dominance critical period.56 
Critical Periods in Somatosensory and Olfactory Systems 
Whisker barrels constitute a prominent feature of the somatosensory cortex in rodents and 
correspond exactly in number and arrangement to the large whisker follicles on the rodent 
snout (see Chapters 21 and 23). Barrels fail to develop if a whisker is ablated in early life.57
However, such peripheral lesions no longer alter cortical barrels after postnatal day 4,58 revealing 
a sensitive period for structural plasticity in the trigeminal pathway.59 One might expect that 
such fundamental processes as the formation of somatotopic maps would somehow be driven 
by intrinsic cues and would rely less on sensory experience for direction. Indeed, blockade 
of peripheral action potentials with TTX does not disrupt cortical barrel formation.60 At the 
same time, although overall cortical structure appears normal, rats that have had their whiskers 
trimmed for the first 3 days of life (but not later) show changes in dendritic structure within 
the barrels and have both impaired sensory discrimination and reduced social interaction as 
adults.61 It is not yet known how such early changes might relate to experience-dependent 
plasticity seen in the synaptic organization of the adult barrel cortex.62
Yet another system in which sensory input is required for the development of normal 
structure is olfaction. Closure of a nostril in the immature rat prevents the normal develop-
ment of olfactory glomeruli.63 In immature mice, each glomerulus of the olfactory bulb 
is supplied by the axons of olfactory receptor neurons expressing a variety of olfactory 
receptor proteins. In the adult, however, each glomerulus is supplied by axons that express 
the same unique odorant receptor protein (see Chapter 19). Blockage of one nostril in an 
immature mouse prevents such sorting out of the axonal supply to olfactory glomeruli. In 
contrast to the refinement of connections in other sensory systems that depends on electri-
cal activity, olfactory bulb formation depends on other aspects of the G protein–coupled 
signaling cascade. Olfactory glomeruli develop normally in mice in which the odorant-
activated, cyclic-nucleotide–gated channel is missing and whose olfactory receptor neurons 
are electrically inactive.64 Instead, glomerular development depends on cyclic adenosine 
monophosphate (cAMP) production and was severely disturbed when the synthetic enzyme 
adenylyl cyclase 3 was disrupted.65 
Sensory Deprivation and Critical Periods 
in the Auditory System
The auditory system provides familiar examples of the role of sensory experience in de-
velopment. It is common knowledge that language is most easily acquired in the first years 
of life. In fact, there is an early loss of perceptual sensitivity to some phonetic distinctions 
that are not part of the native language; for example, Japanese-speaking infants lose their 
initial ability to distinguish between “R” and “L” sounds.66 From clinical studies there is a 
clear correlation between speech or language delays in children and the severity of their 
hearing loss.67 The profound importance of human language gives further impetus to 
studies of developmental plasticity in the auditory system.

Critical Periods in Sensory Systems 579
Studies in animals have focused on manipulation of the tono-
topic map of cortex by over- or under exposure to selected sound 
frequencies, with expansion or contraction of related cortical rep-
resentations.68 For example, exposure of young rats to a continuous 
pure tone expanded cortical representation for that frequency69
(Figure 26.14). Plasticity of the tonotopic cortical map (for near 
threshold tones) is restricted to a brief period from postnatal 
days 11–13,97 but sensitive periods for more complex acoustic 
features, such as tuning bandwidth and temporal coding, occur 
progressively later.70,71
Studies on the development of lower levels of the auditory 
pathway have revealed similarities to events in the visual system. As in the developing retina, 
spontaneous bursting of primary afferent neurons occurs in the immature cochlea before 
the onset of hearing.72–74 Bergles and colleagues have delineated the cellular mechanisms 
underlying this early spontaneous activity and shown that it is depends on transmitter release 
from sensory hair cells (Figure 26.15).75 The sensory hair cells in turn are depolarized not 
by sound (the middle ear remains blocked until postnatal day 12), but rather by release of 
ATP from nearby supporting cells. As in the retina, waves of excitation spread along the 
cochlea, causing intracellular calcium to rise and trigger ATP release to excite neighboring 
supporting cells. Thus, ATP-mediated excitation causes neighboring hair cells and their 
postsynaptic afferents to be coordinately activated. The spontaneously active supporting 
cells make up a transient epithelium called Kolliker’s organ that disappears by the onset of 
hearing, as does the spontaneous bursting of cochlear afferents.76

Regulation of Synapse Formation by Activity in the Cochlear Nucleus 
The influence of sensory activity on synaptic structure in brainstem neurons has been studied 
in congenitally deaf cats by Ryugo, Niparko and colleagues using cochlear implants (Box 
26.1) to restore hearing.77 They focused their attention on the end bulb of Held—a large 
contact made by cochlear afferent fibers on cells in the cochlear nucleus in the brainstem. 
In young deaf cats (less than 6 months of age), the end bulbs have fewer synaptic vesicles 
than normal and exhibit expanded postsynaptic densities. When functional hearing was 
restored with cochlear implants, these morphological changes were reversed (Figure 26.16). 
Cochlear implants also have been shown to reverse the shrinkage of cells in the cochlear 
nucleus that occurs in deaf animals.78

nearby synaptic vesicles (asterisks). In contrast, the synapses from 
untreated deaf cats are large, flattened, and mostly void of synap-
tic vesicles (arrowheads). Postsynaptic densities from end bulbs of 
Held, indicative of release sites, were reconstructed through serial 
sections using three-dimensional software and then rotated (illustra-
tions on the right). These views present the surface of the bushy cell 
membrane that lies under the auditory nerve ending. The shaded

Critical Periods in Sensory Systems 581
Although information is becoming available about local differences in the molecular 
environment and about the inherent properties of neurons, we neither have a comprehen-
sive picture of the molecular mechanisms that regulate cortical critical periods, nor can 
we explain why connections in the visual cortex should be so much more vulnerable than 
those in the retina or the spinal cord. Neurotrophins, a host of neuromodulators, inhibitory 
interneurons, and components of the extracellular matrix are all under consideration as 
factors that control cortical plasticity.84 Still more candidates are emerging as DNA arrays 
are used to examine gene expression during development and after altered experience.85,86
An additional motivation is to determine whether the adult cortex retains or can regain 
elements of plasticity for the purpose of repair, or to correct developmental disorders. 
Comparative studies of birds have provided considerable insight regarding brain plasticity, 
ranging from learning by songbirds87 to determination of conditions for central plasticity 
in adult barn owls. 
Critical Periods in the Auditory System of Barn Owls
During the critical period, neural organization is particularly sensitive to environmental 
experience, beyond that time equivalent sensory exposure does not produce an equivalent 
change in brain circuitry. The critical period serves to form an animal’s nervous system 
in a way that is optimally adapted to the environment and, accordingly, one would expect 
the changes to be relatively permanent. However, emerging evidence indicates that even 
fundamental aspects of established circuitry can be modified if required by an altered 
environment.88 This adaptability has been illustrated by the experiments of Knudsen and 
his colleagues on barn owls.89 Early experience shapes the auditory spatial localization of 
neurons in the barn owl’s optic tectum in a frequency-dependent manner.90 The resulting 
auditory space map must be aligned with the visual world for the owl to locate and cap-
■BOX 26.1 
The Cochlear Implant
Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit expe-
rienced by humans.79 Exposure to ototoxic compounds, 
damaging levels of sound (in the workplace or elsewhere), 
and age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) contribute to 
significantly elevated hearing thresholds in approximately 
25% of people over 50 years of age. Also, one to three 
children in 1000 are born with significant hearing loss, 
40% of which qualify as profoundly deaf,80 with a genetic 
basis for half of these.81 External hearing aids can relieve 
partial hearing loss, but until the late twentieth century, 
profound deafness was essentially untreatable. This pic-
ture changed dramatically with the advent of the cochlear 
implant.82 By April 2009, approximately 200,000 people 
had received cochlear implants worldwide.83 In the best cases, 
a cochlear implant can provide impressive functional recovery, 
such as telephone use for those who lost hearing as adults or 
age-appropriate schooling for deaf children implanted in the 
first year or two of life.
The cochlear implant consists of an array of electrodes 
inserted into the cochlear coil. An external microphone and 
analyzer decomposes sound into its frequency components 
and converts energy within each frequency band into a series 
of electrical pulses on one of the implant’s electrodes. Each 
electrode activates nearby spiral ganglion neurons—mimick-
ing the frequency-labeled lines provided in the hearing co-
chlea by synapses with sensory hair cells. The figure shows 
activation of a cochlear implant by two distinct syllables: 
“ah” and “choo.” “Ah,” a vowel sound, activates electrodes 
further along the implant, toward low-frequency locations in 
the cochlea. “Choo” begins with high-frequency frictives (i.e., 
consonant sounds) and so activates electrodes nearer to the 
insertion point at the high-frequency base of the cochlea.

ture mice with optimum efficiency. The following account shows how altered visual input 
influences the representation of the auditory system in the owl’s brain.
Barn owls are able to locate sound sources with exceptional accuracy.91 Horizontal 
location is achieved by turning the head until the interaural time difference (see Chapter 
22) is zero. Vertical localization is enabled by the fact that asymmetrical earflaps collect 
sound from above for one ear and from below for the other. So the head is tilted up or 
down until the sound intensity is equal in the two ears. The owl’s eyes provide another 
index of the position and path taken by mice. Figure 26.17A shows that in normal adult 
owls the neural maps for visual and auditory space are precisely aligned in one layer of 
the optic tectum (which corresponds to the superior colliculus in mammals). Such maps 
were produced by measuring responses evoked in individual neurons in the tectum by 
sound stimuli from different locations and by light presented in different parts of the 
visual field.
Baby owls were raised with visual fields displaced by 23° to the left or the right by prisms 
placed over their eyes (Figure 26.18A).92,93 As a result, the image of the visual field on the 
retina and hence on the tectum was shifted so that the visual and auditory maps were no 
longer in alignment (Figure 26.18B,C). Over the next 6 to 8 weeks, the auditory space map 
shifted until it once again came into exact register with the new, displaced, visual map. As 
a result, the owl became able to orient its eyes toward sounds in spite of the prisms. When 
the prisms were removed, the visual and auditory maps were again out of register. Provided 
that the owls were less than 200 days old, the auditory map shifted a second time to put its

Maps. In the optic tectum of barn owl, (A) ascending auditory path-
way to the optic tectum are shown. Auditory neurons in the nuclei of 
the internal inferior colliculus (ICC) and external inferior colliculus (ICX) 
are tonotopically arranged. They project to the optic tectum, main-
taining an orderly sequence. The auditory space map depends on the 
time difference of the arrival of sounds in the two ears. Auditory and 
visual space maps are in register with each other. Thus, neurons that 
one records from the position marked “0 μs” respond to visual and 
auditory stimuli that are directly in front of the bird. ITD = interaural 
time difference. (B) Graph of responses to interaural time differences 
plotted in a juvenile owl 60 days of age. The time difference between 
the two sounds indicates the position to the left or to the right. The 
neuron that responds to the time value of a 0 μs interval in interaural 
time difference fires best when the stimulus is directly in front of the 
animal, corresponding to a receptive field position at the center of 
the visual field. Sounds coming from the left or the right of the owl 
reach the ears with a delay, activating neurons with different response 
curves, peaks being displaced from 0 μs and in register with optical 
stimuli. (A after Knudsen, 1999; B after Feldman and Knudsen, 1997.)

that had once learned to adapt to prisms in early life could reestablish these connections 
as adults, unlike animals that had no such experience beforehand.94
Effects of Enriched Sensory Experience in Early Life
Since the flexibility of connections and structure in early life make the brain vulnerable 
to sensory deprivation, it is natural to wonder whether enrichment and a fuller early life 
during the critical period could enhance cortical function. Tests to assess this outcome are 
in practice difficult to devise. First, newborn animals need to be with their mothers for

tive fields were displaced to the left or the right by 23°. Now the best responses (small arrow-

much of the time. Second, it is hard to know for sure what would constitute an extra rich 
and pleasant set of stimuli for, say, baby birds, rats, mice, or monkeys in the wild.
An interesting and unexpected effect of enrichment in early life was found by Brainard 
and Knudsen95 in barn owls, using the visual field displacements already mentioned. In 
a second set of experiments, they repeated their earlier procedures, with one important 
difference in the way the young owls were brought up. Instead of the young owl being 
confined on its own in a cage (as in the earlier experiments), it spent the first weeks of life 
in an aviary where it lived with other owls and was able to fly around. In these owls with 
enriched experience, they confirmed that, as before, the effect of a visual field displace-
ment in early life was corrected in the tectum by realignment of the auditory field onto 
the new position of the visual field. And as before, when the prisms were removed from 
the young animals the auditory field moved back to its original mapping in the cortex, 
thereby allowing auditory and visual responses to be matched. However, in contrast to the 
earlier experiment, now this realignment could occur after periods longer than 200 days, 
at times when the owl had matured and become adult. Thus, the richer early environment 
lengthened the period of adaptability in the auditory system.
Behavioral relevance also can have profound influences on brain plasticity, even in 
adults.96 Ordinarily, adult owls never adapt to the effect of displacing prisms. However, 
adult owls that had to hunt live mice (rather than simply receiving dead mice) adapted 
partially to prisms over the eyes that displaced the visual fields (Figure 26.19). Interaural 
time differences (ITDs) measured in the optic tectum were essentially unchanged after 10 
weeks of displacing prisms in adult owls that were fed dead mice. However, when adult 
owls with displacing prisms were required to hunt live mice for 10 weeks, interaural time 
differences in the optic tectum were shifted approximately half the expected maximum 
(somewhat less than in juveniles). What is particularly striking here is that all the adult 
birds had otherwise identical experiences, including flight in an open aviary. The additional 
impact of hunting was to couple a reward (food) with the desired change in circuitry, 
emphasizing that motivation is an important parameter in brain plasticity.
The impact of behavioral conditioning has also been shown in mapping of the rat audi-
tory cortex. The usual sensitive period for frequency representation in rat primary auditory 
cortex is from postnatal days 11 to 13.97 However, reward conditioning can alter frequency 
mapping in the adult.98 When adult rats were trained to distinguish either specific frequencies 
or specific intensities of sounds, substantial shifts were produced in the representation of those 
parameters in auditory cortex (Figure 26.20). Although all animals received identical sound 
exposures, only the rewarded (i.e., motivated) component gained cortical representation.

The ability to alter the adult cortex has potential significance for overcoming lesions 
or combating degenerative and developmental disorders. Ocular dominance plasticity in 
rodents can be promoted by various manipulations, including enzymatic degradation 
of extracellular matrix, pharmacological enhancement of inhibition, dark exposure, or 
modulation through serotonergic or cholinergic inputs (reviewed in99). Evidence continues 
to accumulate that experience-dependent plasticity extends to greater ages for higher-order 
cortical functions. One can expect that different molecular and cellular mechanisms will 
be responsible at different times.88,100
Critical Periods in Humans and Clinical Consequences

clinical observations made in humans. It has long been known that removal of a clouded

dB sound (right panels, green polygons), while the effect of training to 35 dB has greatly reduced 
the 80-dB best area (right panel, bottom row). (After Polley et al., 2006.)

or opaque lens (or cataract) in adults can lead to a restoration of vision, even though the 
patient has been blind for many years. In contrast, a cataract that develops in a newborn 
or premature baby would in the past often have led to blindness. Before Hubel and Wiesel’s 
experiments, cataracts were removed from children at a late stage, when they were consid-
ered to be ready for the operation. The result was that blindness was permanent, without 
the possibility of recovery.101 More recently, cataracts in newborn babies are removed by 
surgery as early as possible, with excellent prospects for full vision.102,103 A second clinical 
consequence is provided by the now-modified treatment of cross-eyed or wall-eyed children. 
Routinely, the good eye would be patched for prolonged periods in order to encourage the 
weaker eye to be used. There is evidence that a loss of acuity in the patched eye may result, 
depending on the child’s age at the time and the duration of patching.104 Such prolonged 
patching is no longer routinely practiced. Clinical observations suggest that the greatest 
sensitivity occurs in babies during the first year but that the critical period may vary in 
length for different aspects of vision.105 
The parallel with experiments in animals extends to anatomical studies of postmortem 
human brain tissue. Cytochrome oxidase staining of layer 4 of the visual cortex in post-
mortem human brains has shown that monocular deprivation causes changes in ocular 
dominance columns similar to those in monkeys or kittens. Horton and Hocking21 have 
studied the patterns of staining in the primary visual cortex of people that had grown up 
after having had one eye surgically removed at 1 week of age because of a tumor. In the 
postmortem brains, as expected, the staining in layer 4C was uniform instead of display-
ing clear territories for each eye, as in normal subjects or patients who have had one eye 
removed in adult life. Again as predicted from animal studies, a long-term strabismus in a 
patient who developed a squint in the second year of life (after closure of the critical period) 
showed no changes in column width postmortem at the age of 79.106
The development of cochlear implants illustrates the enormous benefit that can accrue 
by tapping into the brain’s ability to reorganize with altered sensory input. These prosthetic 
devices can restore functional hearing after the loss of sensory hair cells. The implant 
consists of a series of electrodes inserted into the cochlear duct (see Box 26.1). An external 
pickup converts sound waves into their component frequencies and applies electrical sig-
nals tonotopically to the inserted electrodes, which in turn activate nearby spiral ganglion 
neurons. Although these devices continue to improve, even the optimum performance is 
exceedingly limited compared to the selective signaling of the thousands of hair cells they 
replace. Nonetheless, cochlear implants can enable speech comprehension (even on the 
telephone) for deaf adults with previously developed spoken language.107 Still more impres-
sive is the performance achieved by profoundly deaf children provided with implants early 
in life—some of whom achieve age-appropriate language skills.108 Longitudinal studies 
of children given cochlear implants between 18 months and 5 years of age show that the 
earlier the implant is received the better is the development of language comprehension 
and expression. Also as predicted from animal studies, better outcomes are correlated with 
more extensive parent–child interactions and socioeconomic status (enrichment). Even 
apparently minor levels of hearing loss can have long-term consequences. For example, 
chronic middle ear infections in childhood can result in long-lasting binaural hearing deficits.
There exists a wealth of literature related to other complex behavioral processes in a 
variety of animals that shows periods of susceptibility. Behavioral studies in dogs indicate 
that if they are handled by humans during a critical period of 4 to 8 weeks after birth, 
they are far more tractable and tame than animals that have been isolated from human 
contact.109 Imprinting is another well-known example. Lorenz110 has shown that a duck will 
follow any moving object, provided that it is presented during the first day after hatching 
and will act throughout life as if that object were its mother. Similarly, birdsongs, such as 
produced by zebra finches, depend on the tutorial songs that the juvenile birds hear during 
a critical period.87 Birds of a particular species will remember and reproduce appropri-
ate (but not inappropriate) melodies that they hear in early life, although they might be 
exposed to multiple song models, try out different ones, and even preserve memories of 
discarded songs.111
The critical period in an animal’s development seems to correspond to a time during 
which a significant sharpening of senses or faculties occurs. Why should plasticity in early 
life be so pronounced? The developing brain must not only form itself but must be able to

represent the outside world, the body, and its movements.112 The eye, for example, must 
grow to be the right size for distant objects to be in focus on the retina through the relaxed 
lens. And the two eyes, separated by different distances in different newborn babies, must 
act together. As if this were not enough, gross changes occur in limb length, skull diameter, 
and therefore body image in the first months and years of life. At all times, the maps in the 
brain for different functions must be in register, as in the owl experiments of Knudsen. Will 
lessons from animal studies of brain plasticity guide future therapeutic strategies? This is 
certainly to be hoped for, since deficits in communication and social behavior can have 
such debilitating consequences.113 Indeed, it is tempting to speculate about the effects of 
deprivation on higher functions in humans. One can imagine, as Hubel has said,13
Perhaps the most exciting possibility for the future is the extension of this type of 
work to other systems besides sensory. Experimental psychologists and psychia-
trists both emphasize the importance of early experience on subsequent behavior 
patterns—could it be that deprivation of social contacts or the existence of other 
abnormal emotional situations early in life may lead to a deterioration or distortion 
of connections in some yet unexplored parts of the brain?
To find a physiological basis for such behavioral questions seems a distant, but not impos-
sible, goal.

SUMMARY
 
■
Receptive fields and cortical architecture in newborn 
monkeys and kittens resemble those of adults in many 
respects.
 
■
In layer 4 of the cortex, however, incoming axons from 
the lateral geniculate overlap and cells are driven by both 
eyes instead of just one during the first 6 weeks of life. 
 
■
A critical period of about 3 months exists after birth, 
during which closure of the lids of one eye causes 
changes in structure and function.
 
■
Closure of the lids of one eye leads to blindness in that 
eye. Cortical cells are no longer driven by the deprived 
eye, and its ocular dominance columns shrink.
 
■
After the critical period, closure of lids or enucleation of 
an eye does not change cortical architecture.
 
■
Binocular lid closure or induction of squint during 
the critical period does not cause changes in ocular 
dominance columns but does prevent binocular 
responses. Such results suggest that the two eyes 
compete for cells in the visual cortex.
 
■
Endogenous spontaneous activity of the sensory 
periphery shapes cortical organization before the onset 
of sensory function.
 
■
Inhibitory cortical interneurons are key players in 
establishing and closing cortical critical periods.
 
■
The plasticity of visual–auditory integration in barn owls 
is enhanced by enrichment in early life or behavioral 
motivation.

■ CHAPTER 27
Regeneration of Synaptic 
Connections after Injury
W
hen an axon in the vertebrate nervous system is severed, the distal portion degener-
ates. Over time, changes occur in its cell body and its targets. The changes result from 
the interruption of axonal transport of molecules that control neuronal differentiation and 
survival and from alterations in the pattern of electrical activity. After they have been denervated, 
vertebrate skeletal muscle fibers express acetylcholine (ACh) receptors over their entire surface 
and become more sensitive to acetylcholine. Direct electrical stimulation of denervated muscles 
causes the region sensitive to acetylcholine to shrink back to the original end plate. The effects 
of activity are mediated by calcium influx and activation of intracellular second messengers. Un-
like innervated muscle fibers, denervated muscles accept new innervation anywhere along their 
length. Denervated muscle fibers also induce nearby, undamaged nerve terminals to sprout new 
branches. After nerve cells have been deprived of their presynaptic inputs, they too become su-
persensitive to transmitters and cause nearby nerve terminals to sprout. In the peripheral nervous 
system of adult mammals, damaged axons regrow to restore sensory and motor functions. They 
are guided back to skin and muscle by Schwann cells and the basal lamina. Agrin, a large protein 
secreted by motor nerve terminals during regeneration and during development, triggers differen-
tiation of postsynaptic specializations in muscle cells. 
The ability of damaged central nervous system (CNS) axons to grow and innervate appropriate 
targets varies widely among species. In invertebrates, such as the leech, and in lower vertebrates, 
such as frogs, axons in the CNS can regenerate and reconnect precisely with their original synap-
tic partners after injury. By contrast, in the adult mammalian central nervous system, regeneration 
and repair fail to occur. CNS neurons sprout new axons and form new synapses only over short 
distances. They can, however, extend axons for long distances through peripheral nerve grafts to 
establish synaptic connections. In fetal and neonatal mammals the central nervous system does 
regenerate, but after a critical period the capacity for repair is lost. Embryonic neurons and neural 
stem cells grafted into the adult CNS differentiate, extend axons, and can become integrated ap-
propriately into the existing synaptic circuitry. Such transplantation techniques hold promise for 
the amelioration of functional deficits resulting from CNS lesions and neurodegenerative diseases.

590 Chapter 27
In many animals the nervous system has a remarkable ability to reestablish with a high 
degree of specificity synaptic connections that have been disrupted by trauma. The re-
generative powers of neurons in the CNS were first demonstrated by Matthey, who in the 
1920s sectioned the optic nerve of a newt and found that vision was restored within a few 
weeks.1 Beginning in the 1940s, Sperry, Stone, and their colleagues took advantage of this 
regenerative capacity to explore how specific connections form within the nervous system. 
Their experiments on regenerating retinotectal connections in frogs and fish provided 
support for the idea that neurons selectively reinnervate their targets during regeneration, 
rather than making connections at random that are subsequently reorganized2 (see Chapter 
25). Later, studies in leeches, crickets, and crayfish demonstrated that, after being severed, 
axons of individual identified neurons in invertebrates can reconnect precisely with their 
original synaptic partners, avoiding a multitude of other potential targets.3 In contrast, 
regeneration of severed connections in the adult mammalian nervous system is typically 
incomplete or absent altogether.4
In this chapter we first describe the sequence of events that occurs after an axon in the 
periphery is damaged. Once again, the connections of motoneurons to skeletal muscle fibers 
are convenient for studying basic mechanisms of regeneration after injury. We then consider 
the problem of why regeneration typically fails in mammalian central nervous system.
Regeneration in the Peripheral Nervous System
Wallerian Degeneration and Removal of Debris
After a sensory or motor axon in a vertebrate peripheral nerve is severed, a characteristic 
sequence of changes occurs (Figure 27.1). The distal portion of the axon degenerates, 
as does a short length of the proximal portion. The Schwann cells that had formed the

myelin sheath of the distal segment of the nerve de-differentiate and proliferate together 
with macrophages that are recruited from the blood stream to the site of injury. There they 
scavenge and remove debris, including myelin, as a first step in promoting regrowth of 
axons. The new axonal sprouts emerge from near the tip of the proximal stump and begin 
regenerating within a few hours. This response is called Wallerian degeneration, after the 
nineteenth-century anatomist Augustus Waller, who first described it.5,6 The cell body and 
its nucleus swell, the nucleus moves from its typical position in the center of the cell soma 
to an eccentric location, and the ordered arrays of endoplasmic reticulum, called Nissl 
substance, disperse. Since the Nissl substance stains prominently with commonly used 
basic dyes, its dispersal following axotomy causes a decrease in intensity, which is referred 
to as chromatolysis. Chromatolysis also occurs after axons are severed in the CNS. After a 
regenerating peripheral axon successfully reestablishes contact with a target, the cell body 
regains its original appearance. If regeneration of the peripheral nerve fails, many motor 
and dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons die. Autonomic ganglion cells that survive become 
less sensitive to acetylcholine and shrink in size. In the adult mammalian central nervous 
system (see following section), the responses of neurons that fail to reestablish contact with 
their targets are variable. Thus, retinal ganglion cells rapidly die if their axons in the optic 
nerve are severed,7,8 whereas motoneurons survive axotomy.
Retrograde Transsynaptic Effects of Axotomy
Axotomy can also cause changes in the presynaptic neurons that provide inputs to the dam-
aged cell. For example, after axotomy of an autonomic ganglion cell in a chick, rat, mouse, 
or guinea pig, synaptic inputs onto the ganglion cell become less effective.9,10 This is due in 
part to a decrease in the sensitivity of the axotomized cell to the neurotransmitter ACh. In 
addition, retrograde transsynaptic effects cause many of the presynaptic terminals to retract 
from the axotomized cell and the remaining terminals to release fewer quanta of transmit-
ter (Figure 27.2).11 Thus, damage to a neuron alters its ability to hold onto its presynaptic 
inputs. Rotshenker has shown an additional, retrograde transsynaptic effect in motoneurons 
in the frog and the mouse.12 When a motor nerve is cut on one side of the animal, a signal

spreads from the axotomized neurons, crosses the spinal cord, and influences undamaged 
motoneurons on the other side of the animal. The axon terminals of those intact motor 
neurons sprout new branches and form additional synapses on the corresponding muscle. 
Motoneurons innervating other muscles are not affected.
Certain effects of axotomy—chromatolysis, atrophy, and cell death—result from the loss 
of trophic substances that are produced by the target tissue and transported retrogradely 
along the axon to the cell body.13 Clear examples come from studies of the effects of nerve 
growth factor (NGF) on sensory and sympathetic neurons, as discussed in Chapter 25. 
Thus, in guinea pig autonomic ganglia the effects of axotomy are mimicked by injecting 
antibodies to NGF subcutaneously for several days or by blocking retrograde transport in 
postganglionic nerves. Conversely, the effects of axotomy are largely prevented by applica-
tion of NGF to the ganglion.14
Effects of Denervation on Postsynaptic Cells
The Denervated Muscle Membrane
Toward the end of the nineteenth century, it was found that denervated skeletal muscles 
show certain clear-cut changes, such as spontaneous, asynchronous contractions called 
fibrillation. Fibrillation is initiated by the muscle membrane, not by ACh,15 although most 
of the spontaneous action potentials producing fibrillation originate in the region of the 
former end plate.16 The onset of fibrillation may be as early as 2 to 5 days after denervation 
in rats, guinea pigs, or rabbits and well over a week in monkeys and humans.
Before or at the start of fibrillation, mammalian muscle fibers become supersensitive 
to a variety of chemicals. This means that the concentration of a substance required to 
excite a muscle is reduced by a factor of several hundred to a thousand. For example, a 
denervated mammalian skeletal muscle is about 1000 times more sensitive to ACh, ap-
plied either directly in the bathing fluid or injected into an artery supplying the muscle, 
than is a normally innervated muscle.17 The action potential in denervated muscles also 
changes, becoming more resistant to tetrodotoxin (TTX), the puffer fish poison that blocks 
sodium channels (see Chapter 7). This change is due to the reappearance of TTX-resistant 
sodium channels that are the prevailing form in immature muscle.18 Other changes occur 
in denervated muscle, such as a gradual atrophy (i.e., wasting away) of muscle fibers.19
Appearance of New ACh Receptors (AChRs) after Denervation or 
Prolonged Inactivity of Muscle 
Supersensitivity of muscle to acetylcholine is explained by an increase in number and a change 
in the distribution of ACh receptors in denervated muscles. This effect was demonstrated 
by applying ACh to small regions of the muscle surface by ionophoretic release from an ex-
tracellular micropipette while recording the membrane potential. In a normally innervated 
frog, snake, or mammalian muscle, only the end-plate region—where the nerve fiber makes 
a synapse—is sensitive to ACh; the rest of the muscle membrane has a very low sensitivity 
(see Chapter 11). After denervation, the area sensitive to ACh increases until the surface of 
the muscle is almost uniformly sensitive to ACh (Figure 27.3).20 In mammals, this process 
takes about a week; in frog muscle, the changes are smaller and take longer to develop.21
The receptors that appear in extrasynaptic areas have not simply drifted away from 
the original end plate. This was first shown in experiments by Katz and Miledi in which 
frog muscles were cut in two; nucleated fragments that were physically separated from 
the original end plate survived and developed increased sensitivity to ACh.22 Thus, new 
receptors are synthesized in extrajunctional regions of denervated muscles.
Synthesis and Degradation of Receptors in Denervated Muscle
A valuable technique for studying the distribution and turnover of ACh receptors is to 
label them with radioactive α-bungarotoxin, which binds to them strongly and with high 
specificity. Bathing normal and denervated muscles in toxin and measuring binding at end-
plate and end-plate-free areas confirmed that the number and distribution of binding sites

is changed after denervation.23,24 In normal muscle, there are approximately 104 binding 
sites per square micrometer (μm2) in the postsynaptic membrane, compared with fewer 
than 10/μm2 in end-plate-free areas. After denervation, receptor sites in the extrasynaptic 
regions increase to about 103/μm2, with little change in density in the synaptic region.
The increase in the number of receptors in denervated muscle is attributable to enhanced 
receptor synthesis.23,25 Thus, the rate of appearance of new ACh receptors increases mark-
edly after denervation, and substances that block protein synthesis (e.g., actinomycin and 
puromycin) prevent the increase in extrasynaptic receptor density in muscles maintained in 
organ culture. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization demonstrate that in normal 
muscle, only those few nuclei located immediately beneath the end plate are synthesizing 
ACh receptor subunit mRNAs; in contrast AChR genes are transcribed by nuclei all along 
the length of denervated muscle fibers (Figure 27.4).26
Denervation also affects the subunit composition and rate of degradation of ACh receptors. 
In mature muscle, junctional and extrajunctional AChRs contain an ε-subunit and have a half-
life of about 10 days.27,28 Following denervation, the half-life of ε-subunit–containing receptors 
remaining at the end plate decreases to 3 days. Turnover can be slowed again by reinnervation 
or by an increase in intracellular cAMP and consequent activation of protein kinase A.29
New receptors synthesized in denervated muscle (whether synaptic or extrasynaptic) 
resemble those in embryonic muscle (see below and Chapter 5). They contain a γ- instead 
of an ε-subunit and turn over with a half-life of 1 day.30–32
Role of Muscle Inactivity in Denervation Supersensitivity
How does sectioning of a nerve lead to the appearance of new receptors? Lømo and Rosen-
thal33 investigated this problem by blocking conduction in rat nerves. A local anesthetic or 
diphtheria toxin was applied through a cuff to a short length of the nerve some distance from 
the muscle. With this technique, the muscles became inactive because motor impulses failed

to conduct past the cuff. Test stimulation of the nerve distal to the block produced a twitch of 
the muscle as usual, and miniature end-plate potentials still occurred normally, showing that 
synaptic transmission was intact. And yet, after 7 days of nerve block, the muscle had become 
supersensitive (Figure 27.5). Other experiments demonstrated that new extrajunctional re-
ceptors appeared when neuromuscular transmission was blocked by long-term application of 
curare or α-bungarotoxin to a muscle. These results show that denervation supersensitivity is 
produced by the loss of synaptic activation of the muscle.34,35

The importance of muscle activity itself as a factor in controlling supersensitivity was 
confirmed in experiments in which denervated muscles in the rat were stimulated directly 
through permanently implanted electrodes. Repetitive, direct stimulation of muscles over 
several days caused the sensitive area to become restricted, so that once again only the 
synaptic region was sensitive to ACh (Figure 27.6; see also Figure 27.4D).33 The frequency 
of spontaneous activity in fibrillating muscle is too low to reverse the effects of denervation 
on the distribution of AChRs.15
Role of Calcium in Development of Supersensitivity 
in Denervated Muscle
What is it about the lack of muscle activity that causes supersensitivity to develop? Changes 
in intracellular calcium appear to be the key factor (Figure 27.7).36 Electrical activity of in-
nervated muscle results in the influx of calcium through voltage-activated calcium channels. 
Increased intracellular calcium activates protein kinase C, which in turn phosphorylates and 
inhibits a molecule known as myogenin. Myogenin is a transcription factor that induces 
the expression of AChR-subunit genes and also regulates other aspects of muscle differen-

In extrasynaptic regions of a vertebrate skeletal muscle 
fiber, influx of calcium through voltage-activated 
calcium channels activates protein kinase C (PKC), 
which phosphorylates and inactivates myogenin. At 
the synapse, agrin (see Figure 27.15) is released from 
nerve terminals and interacts with agrin receptors. This 
activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Ras/
mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) path-
ways, leading to expression of AChR α, β, γ, δ, and 
ε-subunits. Other neural signals suppress expression 
of the γ-subunit.

tiation.37 Thus, in innervated muscle, calcium influx inhibits AChR gene expression and 
thereby keeps overall AChR levels low. (Additional signals that specifically induce AChR 
expression in the few muscle nuclei immediately beneath the postsynaptic membrane are 
discussed later.) In inactive muscle, calcium influx is reduced; this removes the inhibition 
of myogenin and leads to an increase in AChR expression. 
The changes in AChR half-life that occur in denervated muscle are also a consequence 
of reduced muscle activity. The rate of receptor degradation increases to a similar extent 
in muscles paralyzed by denervation and in those made inactive by continuous application 
of tetrodotoxin to the nerve. Conversely, direct electrical stimulation of denervated muscle 
restores the turnover rate of ACh receptors at synaptic sites to normal levels. Again, influx 
of calcium through voltage-activated calcium channels plays an important role.31,36,38
Activity is not the only factor that maintains the normal complement of receptors in 
skeletal muscles. Experiments in which slowly developing changes occur without activity 
per se playing an obvious role have been made on partially denervated muscles. Fibers in the 
frog sartorius muscle are innervated at more than one site along their length. If the muscle 
is partially denervated by cutting intramuscular branches of the nerve, supersensitivity 
develops in the denervated portions of the muscle fibers. Yet these fibers have not been 
inactive, but have kept contracting all along.21
Supersensitivity of Peripheral Nerve Cells 
after Removal of Synaptic Inputs
The effect of denervation on the distribution of transmitter receptors in neurons has been 
studied in autonomic ganglion cells in frogs and chicks. In the living frog heart, parasym-
pathetic neurons can be seen in the transparent interatrial septum, greatly facilitating 
application of ACh to discrete spots on the cell surface. The cells have no dendrites; syn-
apses are made on the cell soma (Figure 27.8A). Like skeletal muscle fibers, these neurons 
are sensitive to the transmitter ACh at selected spots on their surfaces (i.e., immediately

under the presynaptic terminals).39 When the distribution of AChRs was assessed by im-
munofluorescence microscopy, each ganglion cell was found to have approximately 30 
large, dense AChR clusters located at synaptic sites and more than 100 small extrasynaptic 
clusters spread over the cell surface (Figure 27.8B).40 Approximately 20% of the receptors 
were at extrasynaptic sites.41
To study the effects of denervation, the two vagus nerves to the heart were cut, and 
the frog was left to recover.42,43 Synaptic transmission between vagal nerve terminals and 
ganglion cells failed rapidly, starting on the second day after denervation. At the same 
time, the area of the neuronal surface membrane sensitive to ACh increased. By days 4 
to 5, ACh caused a membrane depolarization when applied anywhere on the cell surface. 
In other respects, the cells were normal. It was not the number of AChRs that changed, 
rather it was the distribution (Figure 27.8C,D).44 Denervation reduced the number of 
synaptic clusters by 90% and caused a two- to threefold increase in the number of small 
extrasynaptic clusters spread over the cell surface. Denervation also caused a decrease in 
the level of acetylcholinesterase. Thus, the sensitivity to ACh was increased. If the original 
nerve was allowed to grow back, the sensitive area became restricted once more to synaptic 
sites.43 In certain other chick and frog ganglia, denervation has little or no effect on the 
number or distribution of surface AChRs.45 
Susceptibility of Normal and Denervated Muscles to New Innervation
In adult mammals and frogs, an innervated muscle fiber will not accept innervation by an 
additional nerve.46 Thus, if a cut motor nerve is placed on an innervated muscle, it will not 
form additional new end plates on the muscle fibers. In contrast, nerve fibers do grow out and 
form end plates on denervated or injured muscle fibers. Unlike the situation during develop-
ment, in which growth cones contact muscle fibers at random sites47 (but see also Kummer, 
Misgeld, and Sanes, 200548), reinnervation usually occurs at the site of the original end plate. 
Regenerating axons appear to be guided to the original synaptic sites by the endoneurial tubes 
of the former axons (see Figure 27.1) and by processes extended by the Schwann cells that 
had capped the former axon terminal (see Chapter 10).49 However, if a cut nerve is placed far 
enough away from the denervated end plate, then an entirely new end plate can be formed 
on a muscle. This means that nerve fibers can form synapses in a region that had never been 
innervated, and there they induce both pre- and postsynaptic specializations.
Similarly, after rat muscles are made supersensitive by blocking impulse transmission in 
the nerve or by application of botulinum toxin, foreign nerves are able to form additional 
distant synapses.46,49 After release of the block, each of the two nerves can give rise to synaptic 
potentials and evoke contractions. Conversely, when a denervated muscle is stimulated 
directly, its ability to accept extra innervation is lost together with its supersensitivity. It 
is not, however, a prerequisite that the muscle be supersensitive to ACh for innervation 
to occur. Thus, reinnervation occurs in denervated rat and Xenopus muscles when ACh 
receptors are blocked by α-bungarotoxin or curare.50,51
Role of Schwann Cells and Microglia in Axon Outgrowth after Injury
Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system provide an environment conducive to axon 
regeneration.52 Moreover, they proliferate after injury. If a peripheral nerve is crushed rather 
than cut, the endoneurial tubes and Schwann cell basal lamina that surround the axons re-
main intact (see Figure 27.1). Under such conditions, axons regenerate within their parent 
tubes and are guided back to their original targets. If the endoneurial tubes are disrupted, as 
when a nerve is cut, then regenerating axons enter tubes in the distal portion of the nerve at 
random; frequently, the regenerating axons are guided to inappropriate targets. The growth-
promoting activity of Schwann cells is due to secretion of trophic factors, surface expression 
of cell adhesion molecules and integrins, and production of extracellular matrix components 
such as laminin.53 For example, experiments in which the sciatic nerve is lesioned have shown 
that as the peripheral portion of the axon degenerates, proliferating Schwann cells synthesize 
high levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) 
(Figure 27.9).54 Thus, Schwann cells temporarily supply regenerating motor, sensory, and 
sympathetic axons with BDNF and NGF as they grow back to their peripheral targets. It is

interesting that such denervated Schwann cells also express large numbers of low-affinity 
NGF/BDNF receptors on their surface, perhaps to hold the NGF and BDNF they produce 
along the path that regenerating axons should take. As regeneration progresses, the Schwann 
cells cease production of NGF and BDNF and once again ensheathe the axons.
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), synthesized by Schwann cells and macrophages, also accu-
mulates in the distal portion of damaged peripheral nerves and becomes associated with 
the Schwann cell basement membrane (see Figure 27.11).55,56 ApoE promotes the health 
and survival of neurons by virtue of its protective effects against oxidative damage; it also 
promotes neurite outgrowth and adhesion. Factors that promote Schwann cell proliferation 
include cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor, and mitogens.57 Microglial cells (discussed 
in Chapter 8) also contribute to repair after a lesion.58 They migrate rapidly to the site of 
an injury, where they remove debris and provide growth-promoting molecules to axons.59
Denervation-Induced Axonal Sprouting
Not only are denervated muscles amenable to innervation, but also they actively induce 
undamaged nerves to sprout new terminal branches. After a muscle is partially denervated, 
the remaining axon terminals sprout and innervate the denervated muscle fibers (Figure 
27.10).60 As with regulation of ACh-receptor synthesis and degradation, muscle inactivity 
triggers this process. Sprouting and hyperinnervation occur if muscle activity is prevented 
(by blocking action potential propagation in the nerve with a cuff impregnated with TTX) 
or if neuromuscular transmission is blocked (with botulinum toxin or α-bungarotoxin). The 
terminal Schwann cell plays an important role in the regulation of axon terminal sprouting 
(see Chapter 10).61–63 Axons of sensory cells other than motoneurons can also sprout to supply 
denervated territories. In the leech, for example, the killing of a particular sensory neuron by 
injecting it with pronase, induces axon sprouting into the denervated area of skin. However, 
only axons of cells that have the same sensory modality grow into the denervated area.64
Appropriate and Inappropriate Reinnervation 
For complete recovery of function, regenerating axons must reestablish connections with 
their original targets. Classic experiments of Langley demonstrated that regenerating

Proliferating Schwann cells synthesize two neurotrophic factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), which are held on the cell surface by low-affinity BDNF/
NGF receptors and help sustain regenerating axons and guide them to their targets. Schwann 
cells and macrophages also synthesize apolipoprotein E (ApoE), which may help promote neuron 
survival and axon regrowth.

onic neurons. One mechanism for reestablishing connections selectively is competition 
between axons; in salamander muscles that have been innervated by inappropriate axons, 
the foreign synapses are eliminated after the normal nerve reestablishes its connection.65 In 
adult mammals, foreign nerves can be as effective as the original ones in innervating muscle 
fibers, if they manage to reach them.52,66 Observations concerning the consequences of in-
appropriate contacts date back to 1904, when Langley and Anderson made the remarkable 
observation that muscles of the cat could become innervated by cholinergic preganglionic 
sympathetic fibers,67 which normally make synapses on nerve cells in ganglia (see Chap-
ter 17). (At that time, it was of course not known that ACh was the transmitter used by 
preganglionic fibers or even that transmitters existed!) Similar synapses have been shown 
to be formed by autonomic nerves on frog and rat skeletal muscle.68 In such experiments, 
many of the properties of the nerve and muscle were found to remain unchanged, despite 
the abnormal innervation.
By contrast, the properties of muscles can become markedly changed by foreign in-
nervation. Slow and fast skeletal muscle fibers in the frog have quite different properties. 
Slow fibers are diffusely innervated, have a characteristic fine structure, and do not give 
regenerative impulses or twitches. After denervation, slow fibers can become reinnervated 
by nerves that normally innervate twitch muscles at discrete end plates. Under these condi-
tions, slow fibers become able to give conducted action potentials and twitches.69 Eccles, 
Eccles, Buller, and their colleagues70 cut and interchanged the nerves to rapidly and slowly 
contracting skeletal muscles in kittens and rats. Both these types of mammalian muscle fibers 
produce propagating action potentials and are called slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers. 
After the muscles were reinnervated by the inappropriate nerves, the slow-twitch muscles 
became faster and the fast-twitch ones slower.71,72 A major factor in the transformation is 
the pattern of impulses in the nerve and the resulting muscle contractions—the motoneu-
rons innervating slow- and fast-twitch muscle fibers tend to fire at different frequencies.73
Basal Lamina, Agrin, and the Formation 
of Synaptic Specializations
The only example at present available to show how a nerve causes a synapse to form on its 
target is provided by the neuromuscular junction. There it has been shown that a structure 
that plays a key role in the regeneration of neuromuscular synapses is the synaptic basal 
lamina, which lies between the nerve terminal and the muscle membrane. The synaptic

basal lamina constitutes a densely staining extracellular matrix made up of proteoglycans 
and glycoproteins. As shown in Figure 27.11A, basal lamina surrounds the muscle, the nerve 
terminal, and the Schwann cell, and dips into the folds in the postsynaptic membrane.
McMahan, Wallace  and their  colleagues made systematic and elegant studies of the ef-
fects of the synaptic basal lamina on the differentiation of nerve and muscle.74–77 The key to 
their analysis was to use an easily accessible, very thin muscle in the frog, called the cutaneous 
pectoris, in which the position of the end plates is highly ordered and easily seen in a living 
muscle. As a first step, cells in the region of innervation were killed by cutting the nerve and 
muscle fibers or by repeated application of a brass bar cooled in liquid nitrogen (Figure 27.11B). 
Within days the portion of the muscle fibers in the damaged region, together with the nerve 
terminals, degenerated and were phagocytized, but the basal lamina sheaths remained intact 
(Figure 27.11C). The location of the original neuromuscular junctions could still be recognized 
by the distinctive morphology of the basal lamina sheaths of the muscle and Schwann cell at 
the junctional sites and by the presence of cholinesterase. The enzyme remained concentrated 
in the basal lamina of the synaptic cleft and folds for weeks following the operation.

Two weeks after damage to the muscles, new myofibers had formed within the basal 
lamina sheaths and were contacted by regenerated axon terminals, which evoked muscle 
twitches when the nerves were stimulated. Nearly all of the regenerated synapses were located 
precisely at original synaptic sites, as marked by cholinesterase. Thus, signals associated with 
the synaptic basal lamina had specified where regenerating synapses were to be formed.
To investigate further the nature of the signals associated with the synaptic basal 
lamina, muscles were damaged and the nerve was crushed, but muscle fiber regeneration 
was prevented by X-irradiation. Regenerating axons grew to the former synaptic sites on 
the basal lamina, as marked by cholinesterase, and formed active zones for release precisely 
opposite portions of the basal lamina that had projected into the junctional folds—all this 
without a postsynaptic target (Figure 27.11D).
In a parallel series of experiments, it was shown that synaptic basal lamina in the adult 
frog contains a factor that triggers differentiation of postsynaptic specializations in regen-
erating myofibers. Muscles were damaged as described, but reinnervation was prevented 
by removing a long segment of the nerve. When new muscle fibers regenerated within the 
basal lamina sheaths, they formed junctional folds and aggregates of ACh receptors and 
acetylcholinesterase precisely at the point where they came in contact with the original 
synaptic basal lamina (Figure 27.12). Thus, signals stably associated with synaptic basal 
lamina can trigger the formation of synaptic specializations in both regenerating myofibers 
and nerve terminals.
Identification of Agrin
In order to identify the molecule in synaptic basal lamina that triggers postsynaptic differ-
entiation, McMahan, Wallace and their colleagues prepared basal lamina-containing extracts 
from the electric organ of the marine ray Torpedo californica.78 The electric organ, which 
generates large currents that are used to stun animals, is a tissue derived embryologically 
from muscle that receives very dense cholinergic innervation. It resembles a giant array 
of motor end plates. There would be no chance of isolating the relevant molecule from 
normal skeletal muscle fibers because the area of the end plate is so small compared to the 
whole surface of the muscle. When added to myofibers in culture, purified extracts from 
torpedo mimicked the effects of synaptic basal lamina on regenerating muscle fibers; that

phorylation of MuSK and activation of intracellular tyrosine kinases Src and Fyn. Activated MuSK re-
cruits rapsyn, via an unidentified transmembrane protein, RATL. Rapsyn, in turn, recruits ACh recep-
tors, which become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues of the β-subunit and dystroglycan. Many 
additional postsynaptic components accumulate through interactions with dystroglycan (not shown).

is, they induced the formation of specializations at which AChRs accumulated, together 
with several other components of the postsynaptic apparatus78 (Figures 27.13 and 27.14; 
see also Figure 27.12). The active component in the extracts, called agrin, was purified and 
characterized, and cDNAs encoding it were cloned from chick, rat, and ray.79
Results of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that 
agrin is synthesized by motor neurons, transported down their axons, and released to induce 
differentiation of the postsynaptic apparatus at developing neuromuscular junctions.80
Agrin itself becomes incorporated into the synaptic basal lamina, where it helps maintain 
the postsynaptic apparatus in the adult and triggers its differentiation during regeneration.
The Role of Agrin in Synapse Formation
Additional evidence for the role of agrin in synapse formation is provided by comparisons 
made between developing and regenerating neuromuscular synapses. Early in develop-
ment, AChRs are distributed diffusely over the surface of un-innervated myotubes, as in 
denervated muscle. When the growth cone of a motoneuron approaches a myotube, de-
polarizing potentials arise due to the release of ACh.81,82 A functional synaptic connection 
is established within hours. AChRs and acetylcholinesterase accumulate beneath the axon 
terminal.83 Detailed morphological and physiological experiments demonstrate that mo-
tor axons contact the developing muscle cells at random positions on their surface, rather 
than at preexisting AChR clusters.47,84 Over time, the γ-subunit of the AChR is replaced by 
an ε-subunit, (see Figure 27.4 and Chapter 5), and the density of receptors in nonsynaptic 
portions of the muscle fiber decreases.35
The signal that produces these changes is not ACh. Acetylcholine receptors still accumulate 
beneath axon terminals in cultures grown in the presence of curare or α-bungarotoxin, 
which block the interaction of ACh with its receptor. During normal development, as in 
the reinnervation of denervated muscle, it is agrin, released by motor nerve terminals, 
that triggers the accumulation of receptors, cholinesterase, and other components of 
the postsynaptic apparatus at synaptic sites.78 Among other proteins that accumulate in 
agrin-induced specializations is ARIA, a member of the neuregulin protein family, and the 
receptor proteins ERBB-2, ERBB-3, and ERBB-4.85 It was originally proposed that activa-
tion of ERBB receptors in muscle might be the mechanism responsible for accumulation 
of AChR subunits. However, mice in which Aria genes have been deleted can still form 
normal neuromuscular synapses.86,87
In other experiments by McMahan and his colleagues, denervated rat soleus muscles 
were transfected with cDNA encoding neural agrin. After transfection, extrajunctional 
regions of the muscle fibers expressed and secreted neural agrin. Moreover, they formed

typical postsynaptic specializations, including membrane infoldings and aggregates of 
AChRs at sites far distant from the original synapse.88
Mechanism of Action of Agrin
Agrin occurs in several isoforms that arise from a single gene by alternative splicing.81
Motoneurons, muscle cells, and Schwann cells all express agrin, but only motoneurons 
express the isoform that is potent in inducing postsynaptic differentiation. Agrin is a large 
heparan sulfate proteoglycan, with domains that interact with its receptor (LRP4), and with 
laminin, heparin-binding proteins, α-dystroglycan, heparin, and integrins (Figure 27.15).89
The ability to induce the formation of postsynaptic specializations resides in the 
C-terminal domain (Figure 27.16). The essential role of agrin in the formation of the 
neuromuscular junction is evident in mice in which agrin expression is prevented by 
homologous recombination.90,91 In such agrin gene knockouts, myofibers appear normally 
and axons grow into the developing muscles, but neuromuscular junctions fail to form. 
(The agrin knockout animals die because of failure of respiration). A similar phenotype is 
seen in mice in which the muscle-specific receptor kinase (MuSK) is knocked out.92 The 
lack of presynaptic specializations in agrin- and MuSK-deficient mutant mice suggests that

during development presynaptic differentiation is triggered by retrograde signals released 
by muscle cells in response to agrin.93
The sequence of events initiated by agrin is as follows: first, agrin binds to its LRP4 
receptor and thus stimulates MuSK. This leads to phosphorylation of both proteins.94,95
Phosphorylated MuSK then interacts with the adapter protein Dok7.96 Mutation of the 
agrin LRP4 receptor, MuSK, or Dok7 prevents agrin from inducing AChR clusters to 
form in cultured muscle cells and prevents the formation of neuromuscular junctions in 
embryonic mice.92,96,97 While there is evidence that another adapter protein, Crk, interacts 
with MuSK, the downstream signal pathways of the LRP4/MuSK/Dok7 complex remain 
unclear.98 Ultimately, rapsyn99 recruits the aggregation of AChRs. Much less is known about 
differentiation of the presynaptic nerve terminal in regenerating motor axons, even though

it has been shown that molecules stably associated with the synaptic basal lamina in adult 
muscle can induce the formation of active zones in regenerating axons (see Figure 27.11).78
Regeneration in the Mammalian CNS
The adult mammalian central nervous system has limited capacity for regeneration. Tran-
section of major axon tracts is not followed by axon regrowth and restitution of function. 
Nevertheless, it has become apparent that after tracts in the CNS are severed, axons can, 
under suitable circumstances, regrow for distances of several centimeters and form synapses 
with appropriate targets.100–103
Glial Cells and CNS Regeneration 
Of importance for limiting axonal regeneration in the central nervous system is the im-
mediate environment provided by CNS glial cells (see Chapter 10). Clues to an inhibitory 
role of CNS glial cells are provided by several experiments. First, although axons severed in 
the central nervous system typically do not regrow, motor neurons (whose cell bodies lie 
within the spinal cord) can regenerate severed peripheral axons (Figure 27.17). Likewise, 
axons of sensory neurons regrow to their targets in the periphery but fail to regenerate 
when severed within the CNS. Indeed, after a dorsal root is cut, sensory axons regenerate 
toward the spinal cord but stop growing when they reach the astrocytic processes that de-
limit the surface of the central nervous system. Moreover, axons in the periphery will not 
enter an optic nerve graft, which consists of CNS glial cells.104 These findings suggest that 
CNS glial cells actively inhibit growth.
On the other hand, when dorsal root ganglion neurons are injected into CNS white 
matter tracts in such a way as to minimize trauma, they frequently extend axons for long 
distances in the white matter, invade gray matter, and form terminal arbors.105 Thus, when 
there is no trauma-induced glial reaction, regeneration of axons by adult neurons is not 
prevented by contact with CNS glial cells.
When tracts in the CNS are lesioned, astrocytes, microglial cells, 
meningeal cells, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells accumulate at 
the site of the lesion to form a glial scar. These cells produce a variety 
of molecules that have been shown to inhibit axon growth, including 
free radicals, nitric oxide, arachidonic acid derivatives, and a variety 
of proteoglycans.106,107
In addition, it has been shown that oligodendrocytes from the 
mature central nervous system have a protein on their surface, known 
as Nogo-A, which is a member of the reticulon family of genes.108 Nogo 
binds to a specific receptor (Nogo-66 receptor), induces long-lasting 
collapse of growth cones, and inhibits neurite outgrowth in vitro.103,109 
Application of a monoclonal antibody that neutralized this activity al-
lowed axons to regenerate across a spinal cord lesion. Partial locomotor 
function could be restored, although the extent of regeneration under 
such conditions was still meager.110
Such observations led to the suggestion that failure of CNS neurons 
to regenerate might be due to the action of Nogo and other molecules 
(such as myelin associated glycoprotein [MAG] and myelin basic 
protein). It seems unlikely that inhibition on its own could be the

complete explanation,111 since unmyelinated axons (which are abundant in the spinal 
cord) also fail to regenerate.112,113 In addition, regeneration still fails in transgenic animals 
in which growth inhibitory molecules have been deleted.

and weeks after a spinal cord lesion.105,114 It is clear however that growth of damaged axons 
starts to occur within hours after the lesion has been made. In the CNS, this initial growth 
fizzles out within a few microns unless it is somehow enhanced. Hence, after spinal cord 
injuries, the scar might well be a consequence of failure of regeneration rather than being 
the main obstacle to growth.115
Schwann Cell Bridges and Regeneration
Schwann cells produce a favorable environment for the growth of axons of CNS neurons. 
For example, when segments of peripheral nerves are grafted between the cut ends of the 
spinal cord in a mouse or rat, fibers grow across and fill the gap.116 The graft is composed 
of Schwann cells and connective tissue; the peripheral axons degenerate. Similarly, cul-
tures of Schwann cells implanted into the spinal cord promote growth. This effect can be 
enhanced by genetically engineering the Schwann cells to produce supranormal amounts 
of neurotrophic factors.117 Injection of ensheathing glial cells either into the stumps of a 
transected spinal cord or at the site of an electrolytic lesion in the corticospinal tract likewise 
enhances regeneration of axons.118,119 Ensheathing glial cells are found only in the olfactory 
system, where new neurons are born and extend axons into the CNS throughout adulthood.
A dramatic effect is observed by the use of bridges of the type shown in Figure 27.18.120
One end of a segment of sciatic nerve is implanted into the spinal cord, the other into a 
higher region of the nervous system (upper spinal cord, medulla, or thalamus). Bridges 
have even been made to extend from cortex to another part of the CNS or to muscle. After 
several weeks or months, the graft resembles a normal nerve trunk filled with myelinated and 
unmyelinated axons. These neurons fire impulses and are electrically excited or inhibited by 
stimuli applied above or below the sites of implantation. By cutting the bridge and dipping 
the cut ends into horseradish peroxidase or other markers, the cells of origin become labeled 
and their distribution can be mapped (Figure 27.18B). Such experiments show that axons 
in the bridge, which have grown over distances of several centimeters, arise from neurons 
whose cell bodies lie within the CNS. Usually only those neurons with somata that are not 
more than a few millimeters from the bridge send axons into it. Similarly, axons leaving 
the bridge to enter the CNS grow only a short distance before terminating.
Not all CNS neurons extend axons into permissive environments. For example, if the 
axons of cerebellar Purkinje cells are severed in the adult, the cells survive indefinitely 
but no axonal regrowth occurs,121,122 even if pieces of embryonic cerebellum are grafted 
adjacent to the severed axons. Axons of other cerebellar cells readily innervate such grafts. 
Thus, regeneration depends both on growth-permissive or growth-promoting conditions 
and on the intrinsic properties of the neuron. The inability of Purkinje cells to regrow

severed axons is correlated with their failure to upregulate proteins involved in 
axon growth in response to axotomy and not with the presence of myelin.123
Formation of Synapses by Axons Regenerating in the 
Mammalian CNS
Can axons regenerating in the CNS of mammals locate their correct targets and 
make functional synapses? Experiments on regenerating retinal ganglion cell axons 
indicate that the answer is yes.124 If the optic nerve is cut and a peripheral nerve 
bridge is inserted between the eye and the superior colliculus, retinal ganglion 
cell axons that grow through the bridge can extend into the target, arborize, and 
form synapses (Figure 27.19). The regenerated synapses are formed on the correct 
regions of their target cells, have a normal structure when visualized by electron 
microscopy, and are functional in that the postsynaptic cells can be driven by il-
lumination of the eye. Nevertheless, in spite of occasional reports to the contrary, 
very few axons actually succeed in growing through the graft to their targets.
Regeneration in Immature Mammalian CNS
Compared to the adult, the immature mammalian CNS provides a favorable environment 
for regeneration.4,123 If the spinal cord of a neonatal opossum is crushed or cut, axons 
grow across the lesion and conduction through the damaged region is restored within a 
few days, even when the spinal cord is removed from the animal and maintained in cul-
ture (Figures 27.20 and 27.21).125–127 Similar results have been obtained in embryonic rat 
or mouse spinal cord in culture. Even after complete transection of the spinal cord in a 
newborn opossum, prolonged survival leads to substantial and precise regeneration and 
excellent functional recovery. For example, sensory axons reestablish direct synaptic con-

in a coordinated manner.
There is a critical period in early life during which regeneration can occur. The spinal 
cord of a 9-day-old opossum regenerates after a lesion has been made, while that of a 
12-day-old animal does not. A striking feature of the opossum spinal cord at 9 days of age 
is the absence of myelin and the small number of glial cells it contains. As in opossums, 
neurons in the CNS of embryonic chicks regenerate if the spinal cord is transected prior 
to the onset of myelination.128 
The newborn opossum offers advantages for identifying molecules that are responsible 
for promoting or inhibiting spinal cord regeneration since RNA expression can be compared 
in spinal cords that can (9 days) and cannot (12 days) regenerate. Mladinic and her col-
leagues129,130 have measured changes in RNA between 9 and 12 days by polymerase chain 
reaction, cDNA microarray, Northern blot, immunocytochemistry, and in situ hybridization. 
Growth-promoting molecules and their receptors are over expressed in cords that regenerate. 
By contrast, inhibitory molecules and their receptors appear at 12 days, when regeneration 
is no longer possible. The lists of molecules are long, which is not surprising since during 
the period between 9 and 12 days after birth extensive developmental changes are occur-
ring.131 Candidate molecules overexpressed at 9 days include cytokines, mitogen activated 
kinase, and laminin receptors, to name only a few, all of which can promote neurite survival 
or outgrowth. Those overexpressed at 12 days include inhibitory molecules or molecules 
inducing cell death, such as myelin basic protein, reticulon, annexins, semaphorins, and 
ephrins.130 A next step will be to test these molecules separately or in combination to deter-

mine whether transfection with a growth-promoting molecule allows 
regeneration to occur after 12 days or, conversely, whether an inhibitor 
prevents it at less than 9 days. For such experiments, plasmids can be 
injected into cells in a selected region of the developing spinal cord 
by a simple technique known as electroporation. At present, it is not 
known which molecules or how many different molecules are involved 
in the initiation and prevention of neurite outgrowth across a lesion.
Neuronal Transplants
Among the most devastating of human diseases are those resulting from 
the spontaneous degeneration of CNS neurons, such as Parkinson’s 
disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. In the adult, most 
nerve cells are postmitotic; at present, no physiological mechanisms 
are known for replacing neurons that have been lost. One approach 
to cell replacement has been to transplant embryonic nerve cells into 
the adult brain.132 Unlike neurons from the adult central nervous 
system, which die following transplantation, cells taken from fetal or 
neonatal animals can survive and grow after being inserted into the 
gray matter of the adult CNS (Figure 27.22). There they differentiate, 
extend axons, and release transmitters.
An example of such transplantation is provided by experiments 
in which neurons were transplanted into the basal ganglia of rats after 
destruction of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra—a 
loss that mimics in some ways the deficits caused by Parkinson’s dis-
ease in humans (see also Chapters 14 and 24).133 In normal animals, 
the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (a region in the midbrain) innervate 
cells in the basal ganglia (a region involved in programming movements; see Chapter 
24 and Appendix C). If a lesion of this dopamine pathway is made on one side of a rat, a 
disorder of movement results in which the animal turns toward the side of the lesion in 
response to stress or certain drug treatments. This asymmetry of movement disappears 
after dopamine-containing neurons from the substantia nigra of immature animals are 
transplanted into the basal ganglia on the lesioned side.133 Ultrastructural studies have 
shown that the transplanted neurons extend axons into the surrounding region and form 
synapses with host neurons. Many attempts are being made to repair spinal cord injury by 
implantation of stem cells.134,135
The degree of functional recovery following grafts depends on the extent to which 
synaptic connections are reestablished.136,137 Grafts of embryonic entorhinal cortex have 
been made in adult rats with entorhinal cortex lesions. Neurons of the graft grow to rein-
nervate deafferented zones in the hippocampus, form synaptic connections, and partially 
ameliorate deficits in spatial memory.138 As in partially denervated muscles (see above), 
reinnervation can occur after lesions are made in the adult hippocampus: surviving neurons 
sprout new collaterals to reconstitute functional circuits.139
A remarkable example of effective transplantation is the appropriate integration of 
transplanted embryonic cerebellar Purkinje cells in the adult pcd (Purkinje cell degeneration) 
mouse—a mutant whose cerebellar Purkinje cells degenerate shortly after birth (Figure 
27.23).140 Sotelo and his colleagues grafted either dissociated cells or solid pieces of the 
cerebellar primordium into the cerebellum of the adult mutant mouse. Donor Purkinje 
cells migrated out of the graft to the positions originally occupied by the degenerated 
Purkinje cells. They did so along the host Bergmann radial glial cells, which were induced 
by the graft to re-express proteins involved in guiding Purkinje cells. Within 2 weeks many 
transplanted cells formed dendritic arbors that resembled those of normal Purkinje cells, 
climbing fibers formed synapses (first on the cell body, then on the proximal dendrites), 
and parallel fibers innervated the distal dendrites. Characteristic synaptic potentials were 
recorded following stimulation of the climbing-fiber and mossy-fiber inputs. However, the 
implanted cells rarely succeeded in establishing synaptic connections with their normal 
targets in the deep cerebellar nuclei of the host, instead innervating  nearby donor deep 
nuclear neurons that survived in the remnant of the graft. Nevertheless, such experiments

demonstrate that transplanted cells can become incorporated into the synaptic circuitry 
of an adult host to a remarkable extent.
Prospects for Developing Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury in Humans
It is still not known what causes the failure of regeneration that is so evident after most 
CNS lesions. Identification of ways to suppress endogenous growth-inhibiting factors is an 
active area of research, as is the development of neural stem cell lines that offer the poten-
tial of providing a readily available source of glial cells and neurons whose properties can 
be manipulated by genetic engineering (see Chapter 25). Such advances, combined with 
improved transplantation techniques, may provide hope for the amelioration of functional 
deficits resulting from CNS lesions and neurodegenerative diseases. 
Two important provisos must be borne in mind—important because they are of vital 
interest to patients who have suffered spinal cord injuries. We mention them here because 
many of the papers referred to in this chapter end on an optimistic note and suggest that 
new and effective treatments are just around the corner. First, if and when an effective 
therapy is developed, it will almost certainly be applicable only for repair of acute spinal 
cord injuries. It is beyond reasonable hope to imagine that walking and sensation could 
be restored in a person whose spinal cord had been transected say 2 years (or perhaps 2 
months) earlier. By that time, the distal part of the spinal cord will have undergone major

degenerative changes. Moreover, as with every therapy, there may well be side effects, perhaps 
serious ones. Second, while it is natural that optimism should drive research, no one can 
predict how long it will take until a reliable therapy becomes available. No one (not even 
the enthusiastic scientists who make the predictions) can say for sure whether it will take 
weeks, months, years, decades or longer. To repair a spinal cord is literally millions of times 
more difficult than repairing a computer. While time is not of the essence for a research 
worker, it is for the patient. False hopes aroused in paraplegics can (and often do) lead 
to failure to adapt themselves to their new circumstance as well as they could otherwise. 
Neurologists testify that, if a cure seems to be imminent, there is a temptation for spinal 
cord injury patients to avoid the intensive, continuous physical and mental rehabilitation 
that is required if the fullest possible life is to be led for all the years ahead.

SUMMARY
 
■
When an axon is severed in the vertebrate nervous 
system, the distal portion degenerates. The axotomized 
cell body may undergo chromatolysis or die.
 
■
Many of the presynaptic terminals innervating an 
axotomized neuron retract. 
 
■
In denervated skeletal muscle fibers, new ACh 
receptors are synthesized and inserted in extrasynaptic 
regions, making the muscle supersensitive to ACh. 
Denervated neurons also become supersensitive to the 
transmitters released by damaged presynaptic axons. 
 
■
Muscle activity is an important factor determining 
receptor number and distribution. Muscle activity 
also influences the rate at which ACh receptors are 
degraded and replaced.
 
■
In adult mammals or frogs, an innervated muscle 
will not accept innervation by an additional nerve. 
In contrast, nerve fibers will form new synapses on 
denervated or injured muscle fibers. 
 
■
Partially denervated muscles and neurons cause nearby 
undamaged nerves to sprout new branches and form 
new synapses.
 
■
In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells 
provide an environment conducive to axonal regrowth.
 
■
The synaptic portion of the basal lamina sheath that 
surrounds muscle fibers has associated with a molecule 
known as agrin. Agrin is a proteoglycan synthesized by 
motor neurons and released from their axon terminals. It 
becomes associated with the synaptic basal lamina and 
induces the formation of postsynaptic specializations.
 
■
The adult mammalian CNS has limited capacity for 
regeneration. 
 
■
Schwann cells, in the form of a peripheral nerve graft 
or injected as a cell suspension at the site of a lesion, 
produce a favorable environment for regrowth of axons 
of mammalian CNS neurons. 
 
■
Regeneration occurs in the CNS of immature mammals.
 
■
Neurons from fetal or neonatal animals as well as 
neurons and glial cells derived from neural stem cell 
lines can survive and grow when transplanted into the 
adult mammalian CNS. 
 
■
Transplanted cells can become incorporated into the 
existing synaptic circuitry and partially restore normal 
function.

Open Questions
W
ith each new edition of From Neuron to Brain, our understanding of how nerve cells 
produce electrical signals, how they communicate with one another, how they act in 
concert, and how they become connected during development has become deeper. In 
the last years, major advances have been obtained through novel molecular biological, genetic, 
and imaging techniques. There seems, however, to be no way to guess what new techniques will 
become available in the future and what new questions will arise as a consequence. Thus, at the 
time of the first edition of this book in 1976, few could conceive of the use of site-directed muta-
genesis to study gating currents, transgenic labeling of defined groups of neurons with fluorescent 
proteins, or the optical demonstration of functional columns in the living brain. Many problems that 
now seem unapproachable will require techniques and advances not yet imagined.
What can one predict today about novel concepts that might be incorporated into the next 
edition of this book? One reasonable guess is that more intensive collaboration among basic 
scientists working at the cellular and molecular levels, cognitive neuroscientists, and clinical 
neurologists will be important for understanding integrative and higher brain functions relating to 
perception, movement, sleep, and memory. One can hope also that an increase in fundamental 
knowledge of the nervous system will lead to the prevention and alleviation of diseases of the 
nervous system that arise from unknown causes and that cannot yet be treated effectively.

616 Chapter 28
Open questions about the nervous system and the brain are very different from those in 
subjects such as physics, chemistry, or even biology in general. It is not only the reader of 
a book like this who can point to the important deficiencies in our knowledge and un-
derstanding. A layperson outside science is aware that we do not know the mechanisms 
of higher functions such as consciousness, learning, sleep, the production of coordinated 
movements, or even how one initiates the bending of a finger as an act of will. The same 
person, even if highly sophisticated and well educated, would probably have more diffi-
culty in pointing out what things one still needs to know about relativity, particle physics, 
chemical reactions, or genetics. It is this wealth of obvious, unsolved, and important human 
questions that makes neuroscience so appealing today.
To illustrate one everyday example of our present ignorance of how the brain performs 
its functions, consider a sport such as tennis. An expert player—say, Roger Federer—sees 
his opponent hit the ball. He can compute rapidly where it will land and how high it will 
bounce. The ball may be traveling at 100 kilometers/hour, but he can rush to the right spot, 
arm extended, and hit the ball in the center of the racket, with exactly the right force to 
send it exactly onto the line in the other court (exploiting the remembered weakness of his 
opponent’s backhand), all this in fractions of seconds. We could just as well have picked as 
examples the way in which a pelican dives for a fish, a frog catches a fly with its tongue, or 
a bee drinks from a particular flower. In each of these examples, objects must be recognized 
against a rich background and highly coordinated movements must be planned, initiated, 
regulated, and brought to fulfillment. And somehow, the necessary neuronal connections 
must have been formed. Moreover housekeeping functions, such as the control of respira-
tion, heart rate, and the gut must match the needs of the body at all times.
In the following paragraphs we consider selected unsolved problems in neuroscience 
that might become approachable in the future, particularly in relation to the topics em-
phasized in this book.
Cellular and Molecular Studies of Neuronal Functions
So much new information has become available with such rapidity in the past few years 
about channels, receptors, transmitters, transporters, second messengers, and long-term 
changes at synapses that open questions posed today might already have solutions by the 
time you read this book.
Still not worked out completely are the intimate structural changes that mediate 
the opening, closing, and inactivation of channels. Another major problem, now in its 
early stages, concerns the way in which molecules are transported to precise regions of 
neurons, sodium channels to nodes, receptors to dendritic spines, and synaptic vesicles 
to active zones in presynaptic terminals. The formation of postsynaptic specializations 
at the neuromuscular junction constitutes an example in which the signal triggering the 
localization of key molecules has been identified (see the discussion of agrin in Chapter 
27). Yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which neurons within the CNS form 
synapses are still not known.
In the pursuit of problems of high interest, such as long-term potentiation and long-term 
depression in relation to learning and memory, an enormous number of detailed experi-
ments have been made to unravel the underlying mechanisms. What other mechanisms 
for storage and retrieval remain to be discovered?1 As for retrieval, there are at present no 
serious hypotheses about the way in which you can remember the number of your hotel 
room when you need it or your mother’s birthday. It goes without saying that we still have 
no idea of what neural mechanisms produce consciousness in a dog that begs for food or 
a person reading this book.
Functional Importance of Intercellular Transfer of Materials
Numerous experiments have demonstrated the transsynaptic transfer of amino acids or 
proteins from neuron to neuron—for example, from the retina through the lateral geniculate 
nucleus to the visual cortex. That such transfer occurs is certain, yet we do not have crucial 
information about the mechanisms for transfer or the functional significance. Intercellular 
transfer of small molecules also occurs between cells linked by gap junctions (see Chapter 8).

It has been suggested that intercellular transfer represents a mechanism for controlling 
growth and development. A related question concerns the role of glial cells in relation to 
neuronal signaling (see Chapter 10), particularly in relation to quantitative measures of 
exchange between glial cells and neurons and the importance of such exchange for function. 
Development and Regeneration
In spite of remarkable progress, it is still not known how neurons select their precise targets. 
One can now approach, in molecular terms, problems such as directed neurite outgrowth 
toward targets, termination of growth, and the refinement of connections by selective prun-
ing and cell death. At the same time, we can only wonder how the extraordinary precision 
of connections is achieved, for example, by terminals of muscle spindle afferent fibers on 
motoneurons in the spinal cord. With several thousand neurons in each cubic millimeter 
of tissue, how are the appropriate motor cells selected and innervated at the appropriate 
sites? And through what mechanisms does the same sensory cell form synapses with quite 
different release characteristics on specific neurons in the medulla? As for the failure of 
regeneration after injury to the mammalian central nervous system, the reasons are still not 
known, in spite of considerable advances in our understanding of molecular mechanisms 
that promote and inhibit neurite outgrowth.
Another major question concerns the development that proceeds in early life under the 
influence of experience. In particular, we know next to nothing at the cellular level about 
the effects of critical periods on the maturation of higher functions, including emotional 
states and personality.
Genetic Approaches to Understanding the Nervous System
It is hard to predict the consequences of the revolution in genetic techniques for under-
standing brain function. The present use of transgenic animals in which identified genes 
have been altered or deleted provides a powerful tool, but one still hampered by difficul-
ties of interpretation owing to redundancy of function and unexpected side effects. With 
the completion of the Human Genome Project, candidate genes and molecules that are 
altered in disease and development are becoming known. To analyze this large array of 
information and separate the important from the incidental constitutes an immense 
task. The scope of the problem is illustrated by the study of inherited diseases, such as 
Huntington’s disease, in which the altered gene can be identified by linkage analysis of 
the affected families.2 Yet, although the altered sequences of the Huntington’s disease 
gene were identified long ago, the function of the protein remains unknown. Similarly, 
mutations in genes coding for voltage-gated calcium channels are associated with familial 
hemiplegic migraine and cerebellar ataxia.3 But again, there is no clear link in terms of 
mechanisms. Even for a molecule as important as the prion protein, which is abundant 
in the normal brain and which, when transformed, gives rise to transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathies (of which bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease, is 
the best known), there is no known normal function, nor is there complete information 
about the mechanism by which cortical tissue becomes infected through eating infected 
brains.4 A long-term hope is that genetic therapies will be developed for those conditions 
as well as for certain conditions that cause degeneration of the retina. At present, genetic 
therapies are being clinically tested in patients suffering from macular degeneration 
and retinitis pigmentosa.5 Nevertheless, it is worth commenting that the slow progress 
in devising treatments for Huntington’s disease and other long-established monogenic 
diseases (such as cystic fibrosis,6 a defect in an epithelial anion transporter, the genetic 
cause for which was discovered nearly 25 years ago7) suggest that to develop effective 
gene therapy may take a long time.
On the positive side, the study of human (and animal) genetic mutations, coupled with 
information yielded by the Human Genome Project, has provided important advances in 
basic neuroscience. An example is the discovery of the entire orexin/hypocretin system 
for controlling sleep and appetite described in Chapter 14. On a smaller scale, it was only 
through genetic analysis of inherited human epilepsies that the molecular structure of the 
M-channel became known.8 It is clear that application of known genetic information will

continue to provide new information about the function of individual proteins, through 
the use of small-interfering and short-hairpin RNAs (siRNA, shRNA). Genetic knowledge 
can also yield big advances in technology, for example, the possibility of color-coding 
individual neurons,9 stimulating or silencing them, and recording their activity in the 
brain in situ.10 These techniques are already becoming valuable for sorting out the brain’s 
functional wiring.11
Sensory and Motor Integration
A serious deficiency in our knowledge concerns the enormous numbers of neurons with 
no obvious function, particularly unmyelinated fibers that greatly outnumber myelinated 
fibers. One example from this book is how the various amacrine cell types (more than 20) 
contribute to processing in the retina. Another is the role of group II afferents from muscle 
spindles in spinal cord function.
Mechanisms for the initiation and control of coordinated movements represent problems 
that have seen progress but still remain open. Thanks to noninvasive techniques for imaging 
and stimulation, one can now obtain detailed images of brain activity. Yet more than 50 years 
ago, in remarkably prescient comments, Adrian pointed out (see Chapter 24) that once you 
have learned to write your name, you can do it at once by holding the pencil between your 
toes.12 For our ability to transfer such programs from one effector system to another, we 
have no explanation.
Similarly, for sensory systems, the neural mechanisms for integrating the entire picture 
of, say, a bulldog or an artichoke, let alone a whole room, remain beyond our reach at present. 
In discussions of this type at this stage, the dreaded homunculus makes his appearance—the 
cell or little man in the brain who actually sees what we see. To ridicule this concept is both 
fashionable and a sure sign of sophistication. Nevertheless, the homunculus does have a 
useful function: He represents and continually reminds us of our ignorance about higher 
cortical function. As soon as answers are found, he will die a natural death, like phlogiston. 
We have no way as yet to replace him by a computer.
In addition to these obvious gaps in our knowledge, the mechanisms for the precise 
control of body temperature, blood pressure, and intestinal functions remain black boxes. 
Interactions of the brain with the immune system represent another major field of active 
research that is still at an early stage, with many open questions.
Mathematical modeling and computational neuroscience represent fields that depend 
critically on measurements made in channels, membranes, individual neurons, synapses, and 
networks. However, successes comparable to those of the Hodgkin–Huxley equations, which 
described comprehensively the permeability changes responsible for the action potential, 
have not been realized in other areas. One principal reason is the incompleteness of the 
facts available for modeling complex processes, such as synaptic plasticity and integration. 
For example, how fully could one have hoped to model cortical circuits before the discovery 
of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors or conduction block, and how many more 
such mechanisms await discovery? (Important to bear in mind is that the Hodgkin-Huxley 
model, as it is often called, was in fact not a theoretical model: the equations were derived 
from accurate measurements and curve fitting).
Rhythmicity
Neuronal rhythms considered in this book include respiration and circadian rhythms as 
well as the periodicity of firing by neurons in the cerebellum, hippocampus, thalamus, and 
spinal cord. Except in a few examples, such as the stomatogastric ganglion of the lobster 
and the swimming of the leech, we have no detailed information about the mechanisms 
that underlie the genesis or the regularity of firing patterns. Moreover, it is not at all clear 
what functions are played by current oscillations in well-known phenomena such as theta 
waves or the alpha and delta waves of the electroencephalogram.13 While information 
about circadian rhythms is becoming available at the molecular level (thanks largely to 
work on Drosophila), the precise role of sleep and the way it arises are still obscure, as are 
the mechanisms by which anesthetics produce their effects.

Input from Clinical Neurology to Studies of the Brain
For many years neurology was not only inseparable from neurobiology but provided the 
only method for studying higher functions in relation to brain structure. A triumph of the 
early neurologists was their application of nature’s own experiments to describe functions 
of various brain areas from careful correlation of symptoms with lesions. Their achieve-
ments are all the more remarkable because the use of lesions to assess function is fraught 
with pitfalls. With the newer techniques now available, such as magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), the neurologist is now able to locate and 
observe lesions directly, to follow their progress in the living brain, and to make inferences 
about areas of brain related to higher cortical functions.1 Improvements in spatial and 
temporal resolution seem around the corner. This could allow one to follow in real time at 
the micro level the sequence of neuronal events that give rise to a decision, to perception, 
or to the laying down of a memory.
The dramatic story of Phineas Gage emphasizes the advantages and pitfalls of lesions 
and deficits as a means of analyzing brain function.14 In 1848, at the age of 25, Phineas 
Gage suffered a massive lesion to the brain while working as a construction foreman on a 
railway in Vermont. As he pushed on a tamping iron to place a charge of gunpowder into 
a rock, the gunpowder exploded and blew the iron rod clear through the front of his skull. 
Gage lost consciousness only briefly and could soon sit up and speak. What astounded 
the doctor was that he recovered rapidly and was able to lead a relatively normal life for 
more than 12 years. Gage’s personality, however, underwent a major change. From being a 
well-liked, quiet, sober, industrious, and careful worker, he changed into a loud-mouthed, 
boastful, impatient, and restless braggart. At a time when nothing was known of sensory, 
motor, visual, or auditory cortex, the neurological investigation showed that the prefrontal 
area was associated with the very highest functions of human conduct and personality.
Other examples of neurological observations made in the nineteenth century that defined 
specific brain areas involved in higher functions were those of Broca and Wernicke, who 
correlated defects in speech with the areas of cortex that had been damaged by vascular 
accidents or tumors. Even when precise areas are not known, clinicians and neuropsycholo-
gists can reliably define and separate processes such as long- and short-term memory.
Highly counterintuitive and difficult to comprehend at first sight are effects of lesions 
to the parietal lobe on one side, usually the right. Patients with such lesions may no longer 
recognize that there are two sides to the body and to the outside world. The left side of the 
body ceases to exist, so a patient will not recognize his left hand as his own. When such 
patients with a lesion of the right parietal lobe are asked to draw a daisy, all the petals are 
on the right, as are all the spokes of a bicycle wheel.15 A drawing of a cat made by a right-
handed, 61-year-old patient with a parietal lesion is shown in Figure 28.1. It is important 
to emphasize that these are true neurological defects, not hysterical reactions of the patient. 
Figure 28.1 Drawing of a Cat. The 
drawing (right) was made by a patient who 
had a large lesion of the right parietal lobe. 
Only the right side of the drawing was cop-
ied. All details on the left were overlooked. 
Such deficits are commonly seen follow-
ing lesions of this type. (From Driver and 
Halligan, 1991; drawing kindly provided by

Such clinical observations show that our inner world, which seems so complete, so unitary, 
and so perfect, is composed of elementary components welded together to form a continuum.
As information becomes available from brain scans and from sophisticated tests of 
language and performance, one can expect the exploration of higher functions to depend 
ever more on input from cognitive neuroscience and neurology. Moreover, even as knowledge 
of human brain advances, it is clear from the work of Kravitz and his colleagues that genetic 
studies of lower animals, such as lobsters and flies, can shed light on higher functions such 
as the role of specific molecules in aggressive behavior.16
Input from Basic Neuroscience to Neurology
There clearly exists a two-way street between basic and applied neuroscience. Molecular 
biological and genetic techniques are already beginning to play a role in diagnoses of such 
conditions as retinoblastoma5 and Huntington’s disease, and the possibility of treatment 
with genetically engineered cells is now being intensively investigated in muscular dystrophy, 
Parkinson’s disease, and spinal cord lesions. Sophisticated electrophysiological techniques 
are used by neurosurgeons for recording from individual neurons, for implanting electrodes 
(as for control of the bladder), for noninvasive stimulation, and for devising prostheses to 
replace lost functions. And yet, the development of apparently rather simple techniques, 
such as the implantation of electrodes over long periods to selectively stimulate neurons 
for the relief of pain or for evoking movement, are fraught with difficulties. Surely in the 
future it will become possible to produce effective prostheses for the visually impaired in 
a manner resembling cochlear implants (see Chapter 27). Furthermore, it may not be too 
far-fetched to hope that, eventually, interception of signals from the central nervous sys-
tem or the brain could be used to initiate coordinated movements in paralyzed muscles.
One example from experiments described in this book can illustrate how research in 
basic neuroscience can help to provide new treatments for serious conditions. As a result 
of the work of Hubel and Wiesel on sensory deprivation in newborn kittens and monkeys, 
it became evident that a newborn baby that suffers from a cataract should have it removed 
as soon as possible. Such procedures have prevented countless cases of blindness. This was 
not an outcome that the investigators had in mind at the time they were doing their initial 
experiments on receptive fields in the visual cortex.
For most diseases of the nervous system that afflict humanity (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease 
or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), we have little or no knowledge of the root cause and no 
effective treatment. It might be argued that it would be better to invest the money used for 
basic neuroscience in applied science or neurology. Surely it would be better to find cures 
for the diseases directly rather than trying to find out how the nervous system works? In 
instances in which applied research has been emphasized over basic biological research the 
results have been disappointing, to say the least. For example, the Soviet Union established 
and supported massive institutes for applied research in physiology and pharmacology, each 
with hundreds of research workers. (The type of research in which the investigator followed 
a scientific problem for its interest and its beauty was considered to be “bourgeois,” and 
was not permitted.) Yet, during the existence of the Soviet Union, not one new drug was 
developed there that came into routine clinical use. 
In fact, the best reason for studying neuroscience is really to find out how the nervous 
system works, in both man and in animals. If through this, we get a better understanding 
of what goes wrong in disease states and how to cure them, that is a wonderful bonus. Of 
course, a desire to treat horrible diseases is a noble motive for a scientist, but it is rarely 
successful in the absence of basic knowledge. To cite just one example, the revolutionary 
experiments of Katz and his colleagues on neuromuscular transmission in the frog were 
not initially stimulated by a desire to cure myasthenia gravis. Yet, without their work we 
would not have the faintest understanding or modern treatment of the disease. Helmholtz, 
often quoted in this book, stated in 1862, “Whoever in the pursuit of science, seeks after 
immediate practical utility may rest assured that he seeks in vain.”17

The Rate of Progress
Although books on the brain and consciousness continue to appear at an alarming rate, it 
is surely a disservice to the field to pretend that answers to exceedingly difficult questions 
are just around the corner. For example, if one considers the development of the circuitry 
necessary for playing tennis, it seems somewhat rash to have prophesied in 1996 (in an edi-
torial in Science!) that “the main principles of neural development will have been discovered 
by the end of this century.”18 There is a natural tendency for scientists and journalists to be 
optimistic and to offer hope that solutions for difficult problems are imminent. Thus, the 
time required for the cure for spinal cord injuries has been stated on occasion to be 7 or 
10 years (more than 15 years ago!). Although such pronouncements might well encourage 
neuroscientists interested in the field, they can have a devastating effect on patients if they 
are not fulfilled in the time specified, as unfortunately is often the case.19
Conclusions
When one is faced with the fantastic range of animal behavior, from navigation by an ant 
to the reading of a textbook by a student, it is clear that understanding how the nervous 
system works is a fascinating, open-ended task of first-order interest in its own right.
An obvious inference from history is that approaches to the treatment of diseases often 
arise unexpectedly from experiments devoted to quite different questions. Further, an increase 
of natural knowledge on its own is a worthy objective, for without it, logical approaches 
to prevention and treatment of neurological problems can be only partially realized. In 
this context, it is almost impossible to define the “relevance” of any particular project at 
the time it is undertaken. Indeed, when asked about the “significance” of a research plan, 
complete honesty usually requires a very simple answer: “Don’t know!”
Quite apart from the treatment of disease, the dividends that can accrue for society 
as a result of understanding the development and the functions of the nervous system are 
beyond today’s imagination.

■ APPENDIX A
Current Flow in 
Electrical Circuits
A few basic concepts are required to understand the electrical circuits used in this presen-
tation.  For our purposes it is sufficient to describe the properties of circuit elements and 
explain how they work when connected together in ways that correspond to the circuits 
described for nerves. The difficulties sometimes encountered on first reading accounts of 
electrical circuits often stem from the apparently abstract nature of the forces and move-
ments involved. It is reassuring, therefore, to realize that many of the original pioneers 
in the field must have been faced with similar problems, since the terms devised in the 
last century are mainly related to the movement of fluids. Thus, the words current, flow, 
potential, resistance, and capacitance apply equally well to both electricity and hydraulics. 
The analogy between the two systems is illustrated by the fact that complex problems in 
hydraulics may be solved by using solutions to equivalent electrical circuits.
The analogy between a simple electrical circuit and its hydraulic equivalent is illustrated 
in Figure 1. The first point to be made is that a source of energy is required to keep the 
current flowing. In the hydraulic circuit, it is a pump; in the electrical circuit, a battery. 
The second point is that neither water nor electrical charge is created or lost within such a 
system. Thus, the flow rate of water is the same at points a, b, and c in the hydraulic circuit, 
since no water is added or removed between them. Similarly the electrical current in the 
equivalent circuit is the same at the three corresponding points. In both circuits, there are 
a number of resistances to current flow. In the hydraulic circuit, such resistance is offered 
by narrow tubes; similarly, thinner wires offer greater resistance to electrical current flow.
Terms and Units Describing Electrical Currents 
The unit used to express rate of flow is to some extent a matter of choice; one can measure 
flow of water through a pipe in cubic feet per minute, for example, although in some other 
situation milliliters per hour might be more suitable. Electrical current flow is conven-
tionally measured in coulombs/sec or amperes (abbreviated A). One coulomb is equal 
to the charge carried by 6.24 × 1018 electrons. In electrical circuits and equations, current 
is usually designated by I or i. As with flow of water, flow of current is a vector quantity, 
which is just a way of saying that it has a specified direction. The direction of flow is often 
indicated by arrows, as in Figure 1, current always being assumed to flow from the positive 
to the negative pole of a battery.
What do positive and negative mean with regard to current flow? Here the hydraulic 
analogy does not help. It is useful instead to consider the effects of passing current through a 
chemical solution. For example, suppose two copper wires are dipped into a solution of copper 
sulfate and connected to the positive and negative poles of a battery. Copper ions in solution 
are repelled from the positive wire, move through the solution, and are deposited from the 
solution onto the negative wire. In short, positive ions move in the direction conventionally 
designated for current: from positive to negative in the circuit. At the same time, sulfate ions 
move in the opposite direction and are deposited onto the positive wire. The direction speci-
fied for current, then, is the direction in which positive charges move in the circuit; negative 
charges move in the reverse direction.

A-2 Appendix A
To explain the energy source for current flow and the meaning of electrical potential, 
the hydraulic analogy is again useful. The flow of fluid depicted in Figure 1 depends on a 
pressure difference, the direction of flow being from high to low. No net movement occurs 
between two parts of the circuit at the same pressure. The overall pressure in the circuit is 
supplied by expenditure of energy in driving the pump. In the electrical circuit shown here, 
the electrical “pressure” or potential is provided by a battery in which chemical energy is 
stored. Hydraulic pressure is measured in gm/cm2; electrical potential is measured in volts.
Symbols used in electrical circuit diagrams and arrangements of circuit elements in 
series and in parallel are illustrated in Figure 2. As the names imply, a voltmeter measures 
electrical potential and is equivalent to a pressure gauge in hydraulics; an ammeter measures 
current flowing in a circuit and is equivalent to a flowmeter.
Ohm’s Law and Electrical Resistance
In hydraulic systems, at least under ideal circumstances, the amount of current flowing 
through the system increases with pressure. The factor that determines the relation between 
pressure and flow rate is an inherent characteristic of the pipes, their resistance. Small-
diameter, long pipes have greater resistances than large-diameter, short ones. Similarly, 
current flow in electrical circuits depends on the resistance in the circuit. Again, small, 
long wires have larger resistances than large, short ones. If current is being passed through 
an ionic solution, the resistance of the solution will increase as the solution is made more 
dilute. This is because there are fewer ions available to carry the current. In conductors

Current Flow in Electrical Circuits A-3
such as wires, the relation between current and potential difference is described by Ohm’s 
law, formulated by Ohm in the 1820s. The law says that the amount of current (I) flowing 
in a conductor is related to the potential difference (V) applied to it, I = V/R. The constant 
R is the resistance of the wire. If I is in amperes and V is in volts, then R is in units of ohms
(Ω). The reciprocal of resistance is called conductance, and is a measure of the ease with 
which current flows through a conductor. Conductance is indicated by g = 1/R; the units 
of conductance are siemens (S). Thus, Ohm’s law may also be written I = gV.
Use of Ohm’s Law in Understanding Circuits
Ohm’s law holds whenever the graph of current against potential is a straight line. In any 
circuit or part of a circuit for which this is true, any one of the three variables in the equa-
tion may be calculated if the other two are known. For example,
1. We can pass a known current through a nerve membrane, measure the change in po-
tential, and then calculate the membrane resistance (R = V/I).
2. If we measure the potential difference produced by an unknown current and know the 
membrane resistance, we can calculate the applied current (I = V/R).
3. If we pass a known current through the membrane and know its resistance, then we can 
calculate the change in potential (V = IR).
Two additional simple, but important, rules (Kirchoff’s laws) should be mentioned:
1. The algebraic sum of all the battery voltages is equal to the algebraic sum of all the IR 
voltage drops in a loop. An example of this is shown in Figure 3B: V = IR1 + IR2 (this is 
a statement of the conservation of energy).
2. The algebraic sum of all the currents flowing toward any junction is zero. For example, 
at point a in Figure 4, Itotal + IR1 + IR3 = 0, which means that Itotal (arriving) = –IR1 – IR3
(leaving) (this is merely a statement that charge is neither created nor destroyed any-
where in the circuit).
We can now examine in more detail the circuits of Figures 3 and 4, which are needed to 
construct a model of the membrane. Figure 3A shows a battery (V) of 10 V connected to 
a resistance (R) of 10 Ω. The switch S can be opened or closed, thereby interrupting or 
establishing current flow. The voltage applied to R is 10 V; therefore the current measured 
by the ammeter, I, is, by Ohm’s law, 1.0 A. In Figure 3B, the resistor is replaced by two re-
sistors, R1 and R2, in series. By the first of Kirchoff’s laws, the current flowing into point b 
must be equal to that leaving. Therefore, the same current, I, must flow through both the 
resistors. By the second of Kirchoff’s laws, then, IR1 + IR2 = V (10 V). It follows that the 
FIGURE 3 Ohm’s Law Applied to Simple Circuits. (A) Current I = (10 V)/(10 Ω) = 1 A.

current, I = V/(R1 + R2) = 0.5 A.  The voltage at b, then, is 5 V positive to that at c and a is 5 
V positive to b. Note that because there is only one path for the current, the total resistance, 
Rtotal, seen by the battery is simply the sum of the two resistors; that is, 
Rtotal = R1 + R2
What happens if, as shown in Figure 4, we add a second resistor, also of 10 Ω, in parallel
rather than in series? In the circuit, the two resistors R1 and R3 provide two separate pathways 
for current. Both have a voltage V (10 V) across them, so the respective currents will be 
IR1 = V/R1 = 1 A
IR3 = V/R3 = 1 A
Therefore, to satisfy the first of Kirchoff’s laws, there must be 2 A arriving at point a 
and 2 A leaving point b. The ammeter, then, will read 2 A. Now the combined resistance of 
R1 and R3 is Rtotal= V/I = (10 V)/(2 A) = 5 Ω, or half that of the individual resistors. This 
makes sense if one thinks of the hydraulic analogy: Two pipes in parallel will offer less 
resistance to flow than one pipe alone.  In the parallel electrical circuit the conductances 
add: gtotal = g1 + g3, or 1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R3.
If we now generalize to any number (n) of resistors, resistances in series simply add:
Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 + •   •   • + Rn
and in parallel their reciprocals add:
1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + •   •   • + 1/Rn
Applying Circuit Analysis to a Membrane Model
Figure 5A shows a circuit similar to that used to represent nerve membranes. Notice that 
the two batteries drive current around the circuit in the same direction and that the resis-
tors R1 and R2 are in series. What is the potential difference between points b and d (which 
represent the outside and inside of the membrane)? The total potential across the two 
resistors between a and c is 150 mV, a being positive to c. Therefore, the current flowing 
between a and c through the resistors is 150 mV/100,000Ω = 1.5 μA. When 1.5 μA flows 
across 10,000 Ω, as between a and b, a potential drop of 15 mV is produced, a being positive 
with respect to b. The potential difference between the inside and the outside is therefore 
100 mV – 15 mV = 85 mV. We can obtain the same result by considering the voltage drop 
across R2 (1.5 μA × 90,000 Ω = 135 mV) and adding it to V2 (135 mV – 50 mV = 85 mV). 
This must be so, as the potential between b and d must have a unique value.
In Figure 5B, R1 and R2 have been exchanged. As the total resistance in the circuit is the 
same, the current must be the same, 1.5 μA. Now the potential drop across R2, between a 
and b, is 90,000 Ω × 1.5 μA = 135 mV, a being positive to b. Now the potential across the 
membrane is 100 mV – 135 mV = –35 mV, outside negative; the same result can, of course,

be obtained from the current through R1. This simple circuit illustrates an important 
point about membrane physiology: The potential across a membrane can change as a result 
of resistance changes while the batteries remain unchanged. A general expression for the 
membrane potential in the circuit shown in Figure 5A can be derived simply, as follows:

Electrical Capacitance and Time Constant
In the circuits described in Figures 3 and 4, closing or opening the switch produces in-
stantaneous and simultaneous changes in current and potential. Capacitors introduce a 
time element into the consideration of current flow. They accumulate and store electrical 
charge, and, when they are present in a circuit, current and voltage changes are no longer 
simultaneous. A capacitor consists of two conducting plates (usually of metal) separated by 
an insulator (air, mica, oil, or plastic). When voltage is applied between the plates (Figure 
6A), there is an instantaneous displacement of charge from one plate to the other through 
the external circuit. Once the capacitor is fully charged, however, there is no further cur-
rent, as none can flow across the insulator. The capacitance (C) of a capacitor is defined 
by how much charge (q) it can store for each volt applied to it:
C = q/V
The units of capacitance are coulombs/volt or farads (F). The larger the plates of a 
capacitor and the closer together they are, the greater its capacitance. A one-farad capacitor 
is very large; capacitances in common use are in the range of microfarads (μF) or smaller.
When the switch in Figure 6A is closed, then, there is an instantaneous charge separation 
at the plates. The amount of charge stored in the capacitor is proportional to its capaci-

FIGURE 5 Analogue Circuits for Nerve Membranes. In A and B the resistors R1 and R2 are 
reversed; otherwise the circuits are the same. The batteries V1 and V2 are in series. In (A), point 
b (the “outside” of the membrane) is positive with respect to d (the “inside”) by 85 mV; in (B) it is 
negative by 35 mV. These circuits illustrate how changes in resistance can give rise to membrane 
potential changes even though the batteries (which represent ionic equilibrium potentials) remain 
constant.

A-6 Appendix A
tance and to the magnitude of the applied voltage (V0). When the switch is opened, as in 
B, the charge on the capacitor remains, as does the voltage (V) between the plates. (One 
can sometimes get a surprising shock from electronic apparatus after it has been turned 
off because some of the capacitors in the circuits may remain charged.) The capacitor 
can be discharged by shorting it with a second switch, as in Figure 6C. Again, the current 
flow is instantaneous, returning the charge and the voltage on the capacitor to zero. If, 
instead, the capacitor is discharged through a resistor (R, Figure 6D), the discharge is no 
longer instantaneous. This is because the resistor limits the current flow. If the voltage on 
the capacitor is V, then by Ohm’s law the maximum current is I = V/R. With no resistor 
in the circuit, the current becomes infinitely large and the capacitor is discharged in an 
infinitesimal time period; if R is very large, the discharge process takes a very long time. The 
rate of discharge at any given time, dq/dt, is the current flowing at that particular time. In 
other words, dq/dt  =  – V/R (negative because the charge is decreasing with time), where 
V initially is equal to the battery voltage and decreases as the capacitor is discharged. As q 
=  CV, dq/dt  =  CdV/dt, and we can then write CdV/dt  =  – V/R, or
dV/dt  =  – V/RC
The equation says that the rate of loss of voltage from the capacitor is proportional to the 
voltage remaining. Thus, as the voltage decreases, the rate of discharge decreases. The constant 
of proportionality, 1/RC, is the rate constant for the process: RC is its time constant. This kind 
of process arises over and over again in nature. For example, the rate at which water drains 
from a bathtub decreases as the depth, and hence the pressure at the drain, decreases. In this 
kind of situation, the discharge process is described by an exponential function:
V = V0 e–t/τ
where V0 is the initial charge on the capacitor and the time constant τ = RC. Similarly, 
when the capacitor is charged through a resistor, as in Figure 7, the charging process takes

capacitor instantaneously. In (D) the capacitor is discharged through resistor R. The maximum 
discharge current is I = V0/R.

Current Flow in Electrical Circuits A-7
a finite time. The voltage between the plates increases with time until the battery voltage 
is reached and no further current flows. The charging process is now a rising exponential, 
with a time constant τ = RC:
V = V0(1 – e–t/τ)
These examples illustrate another property of a capacitor. Current flows into and out 
of the capacitor only when the potential is changing:
Ic = dQ/dt = CdV/dt
When the voltage across the capacitor is steady (dV/dt  =  0), the capacitative current, 
Ic, is zero. In other words, the capacitance has an “infinite resistance” for a steady potential 
difference and a “low resistance” for a rapidly changing potential. Figure 7B shows a circuit 
in which current flows through a resistor and capacitor in parallel and Figure 7E the time 
courses of the capacitative current and voltage.
The properties of a capacitor in a circuit can be illustrated by the slightly more elaborate 
hydraulic analogy shown in Figure 7C. The capacitor is represented by an elastic diaphragm 
that forms a partition in a fluid-filled chamber. When the tap is opened, fluid is pumped 
from one side of the chamber to the other. The pressure generated by the pump causes the 
diaphragm to bulge. Fluid continues to flow until, because of its elasticity, the diaphragm 
provides an equal and opposite pressure; then there is no more fluid flow and the chamber 
is fully charged. If a tube is placed alongside, as in Figure 7D, some fluid flows through the 
tube and some is used to expand the diaphragm. The rate of expansion depends on the 
resistance of the tube, and on the capacity of the chamber. If the tube is of high resistance, 
then for a given flow the pressure difference between its two ends will be relatively large. 
In that case, the distention of the diaphragm will be large and take a relatively long time to

FIGURE 7 Charging a Capacitor. In (A) 
the capacitor is charged at a rate limited 
by the resistor, the initial rate being I = 
V0/R. In (B) the charging rate depends on 
both resistors in the circuit. In (E) the ca-
pacitative current and the voltage across 
the capacitor are shown as functions of 
time. The voltage reaches its final value 
only when the capacitor is fully charged, 
i.e., when no more current flows into the 
capacitor. (C) and (D) are hydraulic ana-
logues of the circuits in A and B.

achieve. Similarly, if the capacity of the chamber is larger, more fluid is diverted during the 
filling (or “charging”) process and a longer time is required to reach a steady state. Thus, 
the characteristic time constant of the system is determined by the product of resistance 
and capacitance.
When capacitors are arranged in parallel, as in Figure 8A, the total capacitance is increased. 
The total charge stored is the sum of the charges stored in each: q1 + q2 = C1V0 + C2V0 or 
qtotal = CtotalV0, where Ctotal = C1 + C2. In contrast, capacitance decreases when capacitors 
are arranged in series (Figure 8B). It turns out that the relation is the same as for resistors 
in parallel: their reciprocals sum. In summary, for a number (n) of capacitors in parallel:
Ctota1 = C1 + C2 + C3 + •   •   • + Cn 
and in series,
1/Ctota1 = 1/C1 + 1/C2 + 1/C3 + •   •   • + 1/Cn

Metabolic Pathways for the

Transmitters
The figures on the following pages summarize the predominant metabolic pathways for the 
low-molecular-weight transmitters acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, dopamine, norepineph-
rine, epinephrine, 5-HT, and histamine. Glycine, purines, NO, and CO are not included; there 
appear to be no special neuronal pathways for their synthesis or degradation. Pathways for 
endocannabinoid synthesis and degradation are still under investigation (see Chapter 15).
