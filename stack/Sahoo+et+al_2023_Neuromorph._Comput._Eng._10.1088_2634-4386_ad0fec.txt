Abstract 
To build energy minimized superstructures, self-assembling molecules explore astronomical options, colliding ~109 
molecules/second. Thus far, no computer has used it fully to optimize choices and execute advanced computational theories 
only by synthesizing supramolecules. To realize it, first, we remotely re-wrote the problem in a language that supramolecular 
synthesis comprehends. Then, all-chemical neural network synthesizes one helical nanowire for one periodic event. These 
nanowires self-assemble into gel fibers mapping intricate relations between periodic events in any-data-type, the output is read 
instantly from optical hologram. Problem-wise, self-assembling layers or neural network depth is optimized to chemically 
simulate theories discovering invariants for learning. Subsequently, synthesis alone solves classification, feature learning 
problems instantly with single shot training. Reusable gel begins general-purpose computing that would chemically invent 
suitable models for problem-specific unsupervised learning. Irrespective of complexity, keeping fixed computing time and 
power, gel promises a toxic-hardware-free world. 
One Sentence Summary: Fractally coupled deep learning networks revisits Rosenblatt’s 1950s theorem on deep learning

Deep learning computers are revolutionizing human 
civilization

user-conceived 
solution 
paths 
accurately, figuring out the shortest path by extensive training 
to reach the expected solution [1]. Hallmarks are switches and 
circuits. Demands are increasing speed and resources by 
compromising nature with enormous toxic waste. The next 
revolution would bring computers that synthesize new deep 
networks, invent learning protocols in a single shot or without 
training. Hallmarks would be new data structure, software 
free, circuit free, fully analog, reusable hardware adaptive to 
changing environment [2]. Demands would be fixing the 
computing speed and resources irrespective of complexity 
while compromising the user's control. Realizing all, we 
present organic nested deep learning network, ON2.  
 
Thus far, analog computers emulate either processor parts 
or mathematical operations [3,4]. In contrast, gel based 
general-purpose analog computer ON2 executes an entire self-
learning theory step-by-step. Precisely we required inventing 
a deep learning network operating in a chemical beaker to 
converge a mathematical simulation using astronomical

optimization power of a supramolecular synthesis. It’s 
impossible to read rapidly changing big data, instantly invent 
a suitable model. But, when self-assembling molecules are 
encoded with computational choices, it collides to explore 109 
options/second. Optimization happens almost instantly, 
irrespective of complexity. This ability has remained unused 
because we do not know how to encode & decode 
computational choices to reactant molecules reversibly. 
Inspired by protein & neuron’s clock-assemblies [5], we 
invented a language to encode supramolecule [6]. We found 
no need to read the whole data bit-by-bit, but only periodic 
events or loops as clocks such that the whole data could 
largely be regenerated by assembling discrete clocks suitably 
in a 3D space. Clock is a variable, 3D clock assembly CA 
maps all possible relations between all parameters (Movie S1), 
it’s a theoretical model invented in a chemical beaker. It 
represents geometric manifolds whose corners are resonance 
frequencies [7]. The new data structure ( ℝ3: (𝑥, , 𝑧) →
(𝜙1, 𝜙2, 𝜙3)) enables encoding a problem as geometric shape 
to a chemical reaction using the surface potential of molecular 
assembly. 
 
 
Furthermore, extensively training a learning protocol is one 
of the greatest problems of automation. Learning requires 
finding invariants. An invariant is a geometric or 
mathematical correlation between similar events or objects 
that remain unchanged within limiting variations. We found 
no need to train output. Instead, let supramolecular synthesis 
learn invariants to regenerate only one input using its internal 
clocks. While doing so, the spontaneous self-assembly takes 
control, finds the number of nodes and hidden layers required 
to frame deep neural network, maps the network of invariants 
for fully unsupervised learning. For faintly-related problems, 
invariants construct solution paths wirelessly with no training. 
Answers find the questioner, just opposite to what current 
computers do [1]. With fully remote operation via microwave 
input and instant optical read-out, no need to add chemicals or 
post-analysis of chemical structures (figure 1A). 
 
For better unsupervised learning, layers are often 
engineered in deep networks [8]. Gel computing is a push-pull 
loop that runs between two clock-structures, 𝐶𝐴𝑓 made of 
field and 𝐶𝐴𝑚 made of matter, together they make network’s 
neuron [5]. Both CAs try to match each other minimizing 
resonance peak difference or bias 𝐵, synthesizing at least four 
layers of hierarchical architectures of field and matter in a 
chemical beaker. In four layers, while field structure simplifies 
to a single clock from a 3D clock-assembly, matter grows 
from a single molecule to a supramolecule. While each layer 
ends by optimizing field-matter dual structures, network ∅𝑁
𝑠 
sets optimized pairs as input to the next layer. 3D clock 
assembly is a complex tensor, when nanowires of two layers 
resonantly couple, it’s a dot product of two tensors, we get 
weight 𝑊, that’s also an invariant. Coupled resonance band 
runs second neural net ∅𝑖
𝑠 to synthesize nanowire cluster for 
invariant. Four metastable states, CA, 4D, 5D and 6D run third 
convergence loop ∅𝑏
𝑠 to configure hidden layers of the neural 
network, as shown in ‘figure 1B’. Three nested deep networks, 
∅𝑁
𝑠−∅𝑏
𝑠−∅𝑖
𝑠 assembled within and above continuously 
convolute each other’s clock-assembly or neuron-node while 
optimizing weight-tree or invariant tree [9], see theory in 
figure captions. A common activation function 𝐴𝐹, defines a 
neuron’s state, we replace complex tensors with higher-
dimensional multinions 𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑘…𝑠
𝑠
 [10]. 
 
Thus, three deep learning networks governed by a common 
Hamiltonian H synthesizes distinct fiber clusters that emit 
multiple resonance frequencies with correlated phases as 
clock-assemblies forming point, line, plane, and 3D shapes 
(figures 1C, 2). Together, its invariant tree. Invariants are four 
kinds of geometric shapes or clock assemblies resonantly 
match with the unknown input at a time, create a tree made of 
beat frequencies, beat tree or classification tree. Then gel puts 
internally stored fixed clocks on the tree-edges in a 3D space 
such that real-world-like events are regenerated including 
further analysis. Network transforms (1) to (2). 
Output 
= 
activation_function(dot_product(weights, 
inputs)+bias) …..(1) 
Output = activation_function(dot_product(invariant_tree, 
fixed_clock)+bias_tree) …..(2) 
 
Our computer's operation in equation (2) is a version of 
classic Turing machine, TM presented in equation (1), which 
entails demonstrating that the machine (1) encodes data, (2) 
memorizes data, (3) encodes an instruction, (4) executes an 
instruction, and (5) reads the output. Table T1 displays the five 
steps for each distinct problem, a single nanowire is a TM and 
nanowire assembly is a Universal Turing Machine, UTM (see 
Appendix I for details). 
 
A review of computational complexity: Our computing 
protocol does not necessitate processing the entire pixel-by-
pixel dataset. Rather, we only require access to recurring 
events or clocks, as clocks run, the 3D clock assembly 
becomes an automaton (Movie S1). While for a conventional 
computer complexity means, instead of 1001 use a longer bit 
110001101000001, gel processor can generate a cube with 
triangles in its corners, and continue to add new structures in 
the corners of geometric shapes as the resolution or volume of 
information content increases, we patented it as Geometric 
musical language or GML [11]. Complexity for gel computer 
means many layers of geometric shapes grown within and 
above. The concept is orthogonal to existing computer’s 
increment of complexity, GML’s advantage is noted below.

For example, if a cube has embedded triangles in all of its 
8 corners, then the geometric structure processes 83 
compositions of variables consuming 8x3=24 clocks. One 
nanowire writes 12 clocks (Dodecahedron, geometric shape of 
light [12]), so we need 2 nanowires. Adding more complexity, 
if each corner of a triangle embeds a pentagon, its N 835~107 
(7962624) variations using 24x5=120 clocks, we need 10 
nanowires. If each pentagon has a pentagon, then we get 
8355
~3 × 1034 for 120x5=600 clocks, we need 50 nanowires. 
In 
general, 
𝑁𝑟𝑝(𝑣𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑡𝑜 𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑒) →𝑁× 𝑟×
𝑝 (𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑤𝑖𝑟𝑒 𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑒𝑑), p nanowires are used first, resultant 
structures integrate r elements and finally, they integrate to N 
elements. By counting loops or spheres in Table T1, one can 
observe that gel computer identifies one of 107 to 1034 possible 
choices in a chemical beaker [12] in a four-layer deep learning 
network for almost all the problems. Consequently, 
irrespective of complexity, Movie S1 showed that the pre-
processing time (~2ms), processing time (~10-15 min) and 
post-processing time (~2ms), are constant for all problems 
noted in Table T1.  
 
For digital processing, the “computing complexity” is 
related to “lines of codes”, programs in C++ or Python are 
made of loops (e.g., for-next loop) and their complexity varies 
𝑂𝑛 (Online text E). However, within-and-above growth for 
gel processing logarithmically reduces the resource demand, 
with increasing complexity of 𝑂𝑛, 𝑛 number of resources is 
required. So, we have taken intractable open challenge 
problem (confirming water is dropped in a glass or not; Figure 
S15, S16) as benchmark.  
 
Recent 3D printers use 3D electromagnetic field 
distribution in a cavity to print an entire object at once [13]. 
We built a similar 3D printer where we feed input static or 
dynamic data pixel by pixel as electromagnetic frequencies of 
10-15nW power by an antenna array into the chemical beaker 
(figure 2A; Movie S2). Cavity geometry and the frequencies 
are so tuned that interference by reflection from cavity walls 
builds intertwined isofrequency loops similarly to periodic 
events or loops in the input data (figure 2B). It is a large 
structure. Along the loop path, identical helical nanowires 
couple due to dipole-dipole interaction form weak bonds. 
Finally, all weakly bonded intertwined loops condense into a 
gel superstructure or seed supramolecule (online text A). 
Helical nanowire and all seeds made from it emits phase 
correlated electromagnetic signals that could be written as a 
3D clock assembly. It is our data structure. Self-assembling 
gelator molecules absorb it as an energy packet. Use it to 
optimize helical nanowire's and seed structures length, pitch, 
and diameter (figure S1), so that when we shine 
monochromatic light to read data, time period and phase gap 
of recurring events in unknown data are written as two angular 
momentums and polarity on the rotating photons or optical 
vortices. For complex data with many clocks, vortices 
condense into an integrated hologram, by sorting rings [14] 
input video or static data could be retrieved, analyzed (figures 
S2, S3). A Cheetah video is fed-and-retrieved (figures 1A, S4, 
S5; Movies S3, S4; online text B) to demonstrate all kinds of 
invariances (Movie S5), position, rotation, size, count, 
environment as part of general-purpose computing (Movie S6; 
online text C). Thermal energy ~13 Cal used to melt organic 
gel drives computation, but it needs 10-15nW continuous em 
signals carrying the input data. 
 
We have been developing a programmable fractal synthesis 
for a decade where morphology, speed, and reaction kinetics 
for self-assembly are tuned remotely from a single molecular 
precursor to visible scale [15]. We run a similar 
supramolecular synthesis so that gelator solution can build 
clocks roughly from nanoseconds to hours long. 1012 orders of 
temporal ranges are encoded as loops in 106 orders of spatial 
variation simply by tuning the basic geometry of nanowire and 
seeds (figure 2C). Spatio-temporal density of clocks or 
resolution and time-range determine computing strength of a 
gel, not number of fibers. Thus, the concepts of scalability, 
resources, speed are redundant. 
 
 Periodic events hold intelligence in random instances [16], 
but no efforts were made to organize clocks into an integrated 
time-structure [17] for advanced computing. The gel emulates 
intricate relations of periodic events in space and time far from 
physical reality. The coupling factor ( 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾) between 
periodic events or loops determines physical separation 
between clocks in the 3D clock assembly, not actual 
separation. Fixed coupling offers a protein-folding like 
transfer function [18] delivering input-like output (figure 2D). 
Fractal growth shrunks real world's space and time by power 
law for gel processing. Power indices (𝑃) are determined by 
the coupling strength of periodic events or clocks. 
 
Irrespective of the actual space and time, by choosing pixel 
to antenna frequency conversion table, the limiting times of 
input events are densely packed into the fastest time domain 
of gel and smallest spatial scale so that beating-driven self-
assembly fills slower time domains. By reducing beating 
clocks to one, self-assembly converges computation. 
 
Resonating nanowires in the seed generated by user 
encoded 3D clock assembly try to synchronize. Closely 
spaced, nearly similar frequency clocks generate beating 
signals, forms a 3D clock assembly internally, in 103 orders 
slower time domains than external input. So, two variants of 
3D clock structures coexist, from external input and 
thenceforth internal beating (figures 1A, 2D). Once beating 
3D clock assembly becomes a target, surface potentials of seed 
hold choices. They reorient and collide astronomical ways to

condense into optimized supramolecule by growing and 
shrinking like a feed-forward neural network. Thus, beating 
assists a supramolecular growth by filtering differential clocks 
from the inner layer emitting complex wave [19]. Therein, 
seed structures in a plane synchronize at resonance and vibrate 
at a singular beat frequency (figure 2D). Several such planes 
form a 3D clock assembly with a few clocks. It is a new target 
that triggers self-assembly. The resultant seed structure's 
clocks arrange along discrete lines in space. For each line, we 
get one effective beat frequency and a new 3D clock assembly 
form surface of a topology. When it drives self-assembly, the 
final structure does not beat. Three transitions, filter and 
memorize point, line, plane, and 3D shapes made of clocks. 
These abstract geometric manifolds (figure 1C, 2E) of 
resonance frequencies are invariants, since fractal growth is 
equivalent to orthogonal transformations of two tensors 
representing resonant clocks of gel fibers, for all problems 
(Movies S7-S12; figures. S6-S16; Table T1). ON2 is a type of 
geometric deep network [20], where extracting differential 
clocks in the orthogonal space is like extracting a common 
sphere between overlapping clocks. The number of layers of 
self-assembly required to complete three transitions depends 
on the composition of symmetries in the geometry of input 
clock-assembly. Thus, steps needed to reduce symmetries is 
the number of hidden layers in its neural network. 
 
Since multiple layers of nanowires grow one above another, 
the interlayer beating adds azimuthal or orthogonal angular 
momentum in addition to orbital angular momentum (figure 
2C). In ‘figure 3’, we performed mathematical operations on 
the gel using microwave input and optical read-out. Since 
diluting gel solution, the effective separation between 
nanowires could be increased deriving holograms for few 
nanowires; we map step by step synthesis of fractal growth 
(figure 2E). Since nanowires build a superstructure that acts as 
an elementary unit for the next layer, we get hierarchical 
structures. The hierarchical assembly and the corresponding 
hologram in ‘figures 3A, B’. Normally we do not see the 
differential clocks or holographic parts exclusive to invariants. 
However, by applying suitable ac signals using an antenna 
from outside, we can amplify electromagnetic beating signals 
in the fractal boundaries of different layers, as shown in 
‘figure 3C’. Then we orthogonally project two holograms in 
pairs; 4D and 5D show only superposed invariants post 
projection. Similar orthogonal superposition of 5D and 6D 
holograms diminishes the holographic part due to 3D clock 
assembly. Only the invariant parts survive as a static structure 
in ‘figure 3D’. 
 
The use of antennas to read invariants live prompts us to 
isolate key invariant parts of the optical hologram when 
Cheetah video was fed to gel (see deconvolution 5). Thus far, 
explainable AIs and deep learning protocols select classifiers 
from a given database. ‘Figures. 2D, 1C’ shows that gel 
superstructures resonantly activate geometrically similar 
peaks. Thus, creating new invariants and classifiers to analyze 
the unknown problem. 
 
‘Figure 4A’ shows a chart of invariants for Cheetah where 
from 3D clock assemblies, higher-level invariants were found 
as new slower clocks in a network of clock-assemblies 
(following figure 1C; Table T2). Once we get a gel trained by 
a single shot Cheetah video, we fed different four-legged 
animal videos to the gel (Movie S6). Since invariant parts of 
holograms are generated by beating or interference of 
boundary oscillations of two sub-superstructures of gel, they 
could synthesis new invariants or clock assemblies using 
memorized ones as outlined in ‘figure 4B’. Each invariant 
forms an isolated cluster with a distinct resonance signature; 
hence they get wirelessly connected by electromagnetic 
resonance. No circuit is needed. A new animal fed to a single 
shot trained gel tries to activate its own invariant triplet. The 
differences between two trees in beating activate matching 
invariants, they form a new invariant-tree (figures. S9, S13). 
On derived tree-edges, matching clocks stored inside are put 
to create a new 3D clock assembly, or output (figures. 1C, 4C). 
Thus, gel composes a problem-specific invariant network, 
adds new clocks analysing it without training.  
 
Thus far, automatons failed to discover generic invariants 
because variables governing complex events in nature are 
interconnected in a tree-like dynamic network [21]. A deep 
learning tool has to discover that dynamic invariant network 
grown within and above. An algorithm has to explore 
combinations as the power of clocks self-assemble to optimize 
these fractally connected astronomical variations. In a 
chemical beaker, geometric shapes made of resonance peaks 
are stored. They find way to arrange emulating the 
composition of complex shapes in a problem by resonance, its 
inverse of computing. By that, gel solves an intractable Clique 
problem [22]. Fractal growth initiates fractal resonance chain, 
but, clique matching is assisted by differential clocks. In the 
1960s, deformation along three axes was filtered along three 
orthogonal axes to find invariant [23], the organic gel does it 
here (convolution for belief, 9), but with a difference. It finds 
invariants of differential clocks along one axis for the 4D 
database. Then its orthogonal 5D database is made of 4D 
invariants. Thus, clique error in 4D is minimized in 5D. 
 
To prove that extracting three orthogonal invariants from 
the spatial assembly of clocks is general-purpose computing, 
nine open challenge problems in AI were selected. Gel 
detected invariant trees for nine different static and dynamic 
inputs for problems varying from genetic data for diabetes, 
coronavirus, swarm intelligence, the complex composition of 
classical songs, the open classification challenge of pouring

S16; Movies S7-S12). In all cases, after a single training, the 
gel classified unknown events naturally, or the user could 
choose an exclusive classifier. The tables outlining high 
classification scores are shown online (Tables T2-T8). Gel 
naturally labels objects, classes, invariants using distinct time 
ranges of neurons; stores for decades without refreshing.  
 
The same gel was melted and reused for all problems. 
Computation times for all problems appeared identical, ~10 
minutes. To enhance optical resolution, we use well-
established methods to break the diffraction barrier [24, 25]. 
Please find supporting online Video 2 of our recent report [9] 
for evanescent wave-induced amplification of a nanowire 
generated 3D vortex structure. One could solve multiple 
problems in one gel at a time, in a single shot. So, multiple 
labelling or co-synthesizing varied datatypes are feasible. 
Thus far, parallelism meant sequential hardware arranged 
parallely, here, its fractal deep learning, layers of neural nets 
grow within and above, not side by side. 
 
Appendix I: Turing completeness analysis from a 
computer science perspective:  
 
In six classes of problems summarized in Table T1 online, 
the input video or static dataset is first converted into a 3D 
clock assembly written as an electromagnetic spectrum. 
Although they look different from bits, input 3D clock 
assembly is the first TM (see the tape in Figure 2E), and the 
clock/vortex parameters define the cell states of a Turing tape 
that is processed by a nanowire. Similar to a Turing machine, 
a nanowire can read and write data to an arbitrarily long 
sequence of clocks or tape by changing its geometric 
parameters (Figure 2C), which act as its memory. Output can 
be read using refracted and transmitted optical vortices from a 
helical nanowire (One clock = one vortex = one variable [12]).   
 
The output of a nanowire TM is a 3D assembly of optical 
vortices sent to the other members of the nanowire assembly 
as input [12]. As multiple nanowire TMs reorient in a 3D 
arrangement following Hasse's law, the necessary Turing tape 
manipulations are made via essential state transitions to derive 
an invariant for an accurate output. The nanowire assembly 
can perform a sequence of instructions a certain number of 
times or until a certain condition is met, satisfying the criteria 
to be a UTM. The loop counter for the UTM is determined by 
the ratio of coupled vortices or the number of phase singularity 
points in the optical vortex assembly. Its grammar is listed in 
Figure S13 and musical problems like Figure S6 is a perfect 
example, because without high precision counter, there is no 
music, all that one would get is noise.  
 
However, a nanowire assembly can process long stretches 
of single or smaller nanowire assembly generated vortex 
assemblies without the need for external input, much like a 
Universal Turing Machine (UTM) that can compute following 
Hasse’s law without external control. Thus, the nanowire 
assembly is a TM and runs single nanowire made TMs similar 
to ribosomes running m-RNA, satisfying the criterion for a 
UTM ([26, 27]). Running part of algorithm is shown in 
Figures S15 and S16, where a benchmark open challenge was 
solved. Gel ran multiple TMs made of isolated clusters in a 
global TM, yet addressed all specific features of local issues. 
 
Furthermore, all problems in Table T1 online have two 
phases, solving one part of a problem and using the derived 
3D nanowire assembly or processing circuit to solve a faintly 
associated but new problem for which it was not trained 
(Figure S9, S10, S11, S12). Thus, the nanowire assembly is a 
Turing complete generic algorithm processor and can compute 
any computable function as listed in Figure S13. 
 
Finally, to be a true UTM, the nanowire assembly must 
perform Boolean algorithms. While reading a single nanowire 
TM generated vortex assembly, the nanowire assembly 
measures polarization of all clocks, density, and sum of phase 
singularity points, 3D coordinates of vortices, and adjusts its 
own 
configuration 
to 
include 
suitable 
symmetries. 
Polarization of vortices or clockwise (1) and anticlockwise (0) 
rotation of an optical vortex is essentially used here to encode 
Boolean codes. Instead of (0,1) it’s a rotating circle or 
polarized optical vortex. The phase singularity points on a 
vector vortex beam or perimeter of the ring of light counts the 
number of loops to run for executing a program. So, UTM has 
a counter for an instructional or conditional halt (see falcon 
attacking birds Figure S12). Polarization of vortices leads to 
constructive and destructive interference that ensures a logic 
gate-like Boolean operation, execute conditional stop, run, 
branching out, and wait for a value to arrive (Figure S13). 
 
Previous reports have described how to write various 
existing computer’s data formats into a 3D clock assembly 
(Online text D); Chapter 4, [28]). Consequently, any algorithm 
can be written using a 3D clock assembly, and its distinctive 
features are processed as a separate engine in the nanowire 
assembly or UTM in the chemical beaker. However, a reader 
should note that a true UTM cannot exist in principle, all so 
called UTMs partially satisfy the criterion.

Figure 1. Organic all chemical Nested deep learning Network ON2. A. Three phase gel computer explained in three columns. 
Microwave input to 3D printer by four pre-processing steps (left column) (Movies S1), four-layered organic synthesis, clock-
assembly CA, 4D, 5D, 6D constitute ON2 (middle) and optical read-out by four post-processing steps (right column). Input 
Cheetah image converted to X-Y-F (F=frequency~pixel RGB) is fed to gel precursor solution via antenna array. Pixels of leg 
edge forms a loop. Below, 3D clock assembly 𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑘 holds six primary body parts. Each clock in 3D clock assembly 
CA::(ℝ3: (𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧) →(𝜙1, 𝜙2, 𝜙3), a positive-definite tensor 𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑘= 𝑈𝑒𝑓, 𝑓= ln (𝑃𝑇); 𝑃 is the deformation of input 𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑘

memorized 𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑘). For ON2 (middle) helical nanowire synthesis selects number of node classes (rows) and number of hidden 
layers (columns) as 𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑘 requires to attain convergent structure. Below ON2 (middle column) four neurons shown in sequence. 
Dot product of multinion tensors of weight functions or invariants form 4D (𝑆𝑉 (∅1)), 5D (𝑆𝑃(∅2)) and 6D datasets (𝑆𝐿(∅3)). 
Weight function of neuron is a network too.  Post processing (column right), sorts angular momentum of photons find (t) or

Figure 3. Experimental evidence for mathematical proof of invariants for Cheetah: A. Elementary mathematical 
operations carried out by feeding Cheetah video through gel precursors as the structures grow from singlet helical nanowire to 
doublet to a pair of doublets or namely a multiplate (right to the left). Four such multiplates build a mesh. Five meshes could 
be investigated at max by adjusting solvent precursor ratio, taking a sample from solution, carrying out SEM (first row, right 
to left). B. Below each SEM image, the corresponding optical vortex assembly ℤ is shown.  C. In the third row, the wireless 
antenna is switched ON to amplify a few bands by pumping additional electromagnetic signals that are orthogonal transformed 
vortices 𝑆𝑉 ( ∅1 ) 𝑆𝑃( ∅2 ), and 𝑆𝐿( ∅3 ). D. After orthogonal transformation, by using mirrors and feeding two new 
electromagnetic signals to the gel, the dot products of  𝑆𝑉 (∅1) & 𝑆𝑃(∅2), and 𝑆𝑃(∅2), & 𝑆𝐿(∅3) are derived. Frequencies are 
tuned to amplify 𝑆𝑉+ 𝑆𝑃 and 𝑆𝐿+ 𝑆𝑃, We find significant disappearance of clocks other than the invariant elements of the 
invariant tree. To the left, an image of the cheetah’s invariant tree is shown. Two 3D clock assemblies, one memorized (𝐴𝑖𝑗𝑘)

Figure 4. Invariant-tree driven synthesis of new classifiers as a dedicated analysis protocol: A. Four columns show four 
phases of classifications to analyze events without training. The first column shows single shot learning of a running Cheetah 
dynamics by a gel. The second column shows the determination of spontaneous classifiers by gel in its vortex assembly. The 
third column shows combining different classifiers to synthesize new sets of classifiers. The fourth column shows how 
synthesized classifiers are used to analyze events for which the gel was not trained (Less than one shot or LO shot learning; 
Movie S7). Identify the classifiers spontaneously and sort test sets by solving the Clique problem: Train & test structures are 
matched. The classification efficiency score is the combination of three parameters (online tables T2-T8). The ratio of maximum 
overlapping area between the input and output, the ratio of differences in the clocks used relative to the number of clocks used, 
and weighted average angular differences between different geometric planes. 3D geometric shape mismatch is estimated in 
the detection score. B. The live growth in the gel superstructure, synthesis of combinatorial classes adopts distinct structural 
symmetries which couple by electromagnetic resonance of frequency triplets (𝜐1, 𝜐2, 𝜐3). C. Invariant matching is shown by 
superposing train and the test 3D clock assemblies. It starts from SL, transcends to SP, and finally reaches SL. Then the nested 
loops run. Differential 𝜕𝜂𝜕∅
